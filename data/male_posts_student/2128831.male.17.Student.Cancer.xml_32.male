What can I do to make you mine? Fallen so hard, so fast this time What did I say, what did you do? How did I fall in love with you?      Don't Need No Hateration   I  hate George Bush. I hate being gay. I hate Hootie and the Blowfish. I hate this. I hate that. I hate you. Blah, blah, blah!  Wanna know what I hate? That God damn word hate. It's such a strong word. You can't get any more negative than hate. Using that word ruins perfectly decent conversation. Really, who wants to hang out with someone who's full of hate? It's depressing.  People tell me what you LOVE     Mrhahahaha! So, I so jus' found out that solidified milk fat is good! Merrmrr!!!      OMG,  Begeezus, somebody needs to disguise a ringtone as a car driving by, or an ambulance noise, or a guy coughing. A friend of mine suggested that another friend had a phone like her's, where one of the ringtone's is the sound of a cow, mooing. GEE! HOW UNSUSPICIOUS. GEEZUS, DID SOMEBODY BRING A COW INTO HIGH SCHOOL TODAY? WILL IS THAT A FUCKING COW DYING IN YOUR BAG?!  GOD, HELL YOU TOTE A MESSANGER BAG, IT’S LIKE A PURSE. IS THE COW IN THE KITCHEN SINK?  You mind as well change to a jellyfish, they bubble, that would be less noticeable then a slaughter house.  Some friend and I decided we'd be long-distance crushes. And while I know this is completely in jest it still made me smile and feel really good about myself. And maybe if it wasn't long-distance crushes it wouldn't be so much in jest, But I think the idea of someone liking me has become so foreign lately. I don’t get this much attention.  Why would I? it seems I've had so many of these one-off dates lately that go nowhere (no pun intended) or a couple two-fers that seem like they have potential then peter out into nothingness (again, no pun intended, honest. I've been quite the well-behaved child lately since the last year) so I think it's a little funny that like a jesting crush (on someone who's totally crushworthy, no doubt) could make my week. And these one-offs or two-fers say they want to be friends, or express interest in going out again yet it's all talk.  And I believe them every time of course, Ii fall for it every time hook line and sinker. Other people are so much better at just turning "it" off. Whatever!  The "it" was about me that drew them to me in the first place, they can turn "it" off just as fast as "it" was turned on. I think that's why I'm different. I invest a little more of myself in the other person, too much more, more than I should, all of this I know. and I'm trying to invest less of myself in people, Tell myself most people aren't worth it, and be more selective and I'm getting better but I guess lapses are made every once in awhile. But being the rejected one you can only try so much to get a friendship. Emails unanswered, phone calls unreturned, IMs to sudden away messages and its difficult, as the rejected one, in drawing that line. You want the other person to know that you are interested in a friendship if they are being genuine, but want to advance as such so the pains of rejections aren’t brutally obvious or that they know you're not clinging to some hope of reconciliation and a return to your previous form. And I think it's that rapid decline that makes things so much more difficult for me to deal with. I guess I haven't wrapped my mind around how you can mean a lot (or seemingly mean a lot) to someone one day, then nothing to them the next without any significant change taking place. NOT BITCHING, jus’ musing.   I can't seem to do a lot of anything right, but I am trying, to all of those that I have have hurt, I am sorry.  I seem to do so much that I need to stop and think what is life and how I wish to live it.  I have lied and cut and done all the things that was done to me in my past, those things I said I would never do, but these actions were in fear,  I am sorry I am not used to these feelings, not since I was thirteen, and briefly a little over a month ago with Michael, I fear that I am not what you wished for or wanted.  I am unrational I know, but it is my feelings.    Keeping up appearances Keeping up with the Joneses Fooling my selfish heart Going through the motions But I'm fooling myself I'm fooling myself 'Cause you say you love me And then you do it again You do it again You say your sorries And then you do it again You do it again Everybody thinks you're well Everybody thinks I'm ill Watching me fall apart Falling under your spell But you're fooling yourself You're fooling yourself 'Cause you say you love me And then you do it again You do it again You say your sorries And then you do it again You do it again  And again and again and again and again Oh, but you're fooling yourself You're fooling yourself 'Cause you say you love me And then you do it again You do it again You say your sorries Then you do it again You do it again You say you love me And then you do it again You do it again You say your sorries Then you do it again You do it again  And again and again and again and again  This is me and I am sorry, I am trying soooo hard to break my fears and try to live, but it is really hard, my pattern is set and I need help and understanding to break the mold.   I am tired already, and I have activities for Winterfest to do… Only thick coffee has the answer! Can someone wake me up at 9 later? Hehe! No... I'd rather have someone pick me up off the floor.
