Both boys and girls asleep. They huff, they wince; They snore.  I turn around and see all these people, and I feel tired and sick and cold. But then I see you, lying next to me: Silent. Sombre, Quiet and Calm. You're the most beautiful thing, ever to be seen, with your face half-covered by your arm.  Your face and your skin, they all seem so different. Like nothing you can see on a screen. And somehow you shine, like your soul is alive, grown wings and flown into me.  Words cannot describe you; And yes, that's an old clich√©. But in the morning, you'll be gone. And no longer by my side you can stay.  I love the way you look, the way you sound, the way you smell. And even if all i can have is one glimpse of you, i'd sell my soul to hell.
