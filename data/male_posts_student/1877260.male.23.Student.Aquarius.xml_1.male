I assume this is because she's got a new boy friend and a busy job, so I congratulated her and said I'm really happy for her (which I really am). In return of my good will she questioned sharply my intentions.  All of a sudden, I remembered why I wanted to break up with her in the first place.  It's really quite pathetic, you see. I'm sure most man on this planet would agree that she's a punishing, bitter woman who's never satisfied with her relationships. Yet I dated her for five years, and in the process developed an incredible patience for women; only to suffer an extremely torturing breakup which probably should have happened years before.  And I still don't learn, or even remember. Forgiving is a virtue, but I suspect I just forget and gets reminded at some stage, which will then lead to another round of excruciatingly painful conversation.  I need to learn to remember.
