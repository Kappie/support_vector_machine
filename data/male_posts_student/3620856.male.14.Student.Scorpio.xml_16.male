I had to swim alot as part of my training... after swimming for about 2 hours without stopping, i felt dizzy... I still had to go to my aunt's house for dinner... It's so boring here in singapore... so small... so little places to go... all the things here also very expensive...   The holidays were very boring... I did the same thing everyday... First, i woke up, then i had breakfast, then i play my PS2 for very long till dinner because i skipped lunch... then, i watch tv at 9pm till 10pm, then, i play PS2 again till i feel like sleeping...   I finally managed to watch 'battle royale' the movie version... It is very sadistic... Very sick, very gross... But, very nice show... It is about a class of 15 year-olds getting selected for a 'population control' program called the 'battle royale system'. In this program, it is like a game. The winner gets to go home as the whole class is stranded on a deserted island. The rules of the game is very simple. It is kill or be killed. When the class of 40 reached the island, two other people joined them in the game. One of them joined to experience the 'joy' of killing, while the other one was drugged and brought to the island to make sure that the game goes as plan. The rest i cannot say... as it is either too sadistic or too gross... anyways, you should watch it as it is a very nice movie
