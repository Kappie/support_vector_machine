(I will back-log and start at the first race). I won't focus too much on Driver / Constructor points, as those can be found anywhere. I will mostly be posting my thoughts and views on each particular race. (Granted, most of those thoughts and views will be a little biased, as I'm especially a Renault fan .....) I love Renault, coz they're my favourite. I hate Ferrari, coz they keep whipping the Renaults. I dislike Minardi, coz, well honestly, they suck.......  But that's just me.  NB: A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO Black_Lotus, Garson007 AND THE REST OF NAG CREW...... MEET THEM ALL HERE AT   urlLink NAG
