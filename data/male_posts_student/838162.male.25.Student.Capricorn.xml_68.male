All of which are not yet completely done. And they are all due within the next two weeks. I just seem to keep getting stuck whenever I focus on one, thus I have to keep jumping from topic to topic. The problem lies in that all three projects are based on some form of programming and to even start to code requires some time to learn the different languages and their quirks. Needless to say, it’s this learning curve as well as troubleshooting that have really taken up a lot of my time.   I’m afraid that I may not meet the deadline for the last project and I’m not sure what kind of extension, if any, I will get and what kind of grade penalty I’ll receive because of it.  *Sigh*  In any case, it’s all my own fault really. I think I spend too much time running into brick walls when it comes to my projects then stepping back and thinking about how to find another way around them and not feel frustrated. It’s strange. I am usually not the kind to be so incapacitated by my emotions. I’m usually in far better control over them. And yet I wonder where all the time as went. In the last 25 days I’ve only been out of the house 9 times. It’s insane. I put aside everything, all my other outside commitments and yet I still can’t do 3 simple projects.  *sigh*  this doesn’t bode well. If such a small workload is killing me, how am I going to handle real working conditions?    This is turning into a nightmare, and it may only get worse. If I do fail the module for the 3rd project because I miss the deadline, I don’t know what is to become of my course schedule, will they let me continue into next year course? or will they require me to wait until I retake the module, which is the problem since I believe the next time this module is conducted again is in next April.   Guess I just have to buckle down, ride the storm and put my nose to the grindstone. And after it’s over, I’ll have to take a nice long look at how I handle my emotions, my time and my responsibility to my work.
