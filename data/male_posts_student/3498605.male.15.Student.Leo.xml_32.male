Especially my geomertry final. I wanted to finish within the first hour so I could hang with my friends for the 30-minute "buffer" period. Unfortunately I worked reall slow, becuase it was like the clock was taunting me, saying, "HAHA, HAHA, you're not gonna finish! HAHA,HAHA, you suck! HAHA, HAHA, go burn in hell!" I swear, if the clock was a human, it would be a little demeted goth girl sitting in the corner saying that with her head spinning around. She might as well have been spitting vomit out, and then it could of been exactly like the Exorcist. HEHE! Anyways, I'm sleeping in tomorrow while all, or at least most of the students at my school will be taking tests! MWEHEHEHEHEHEHE! No, I'm just kidding!  later, bradleyJ
