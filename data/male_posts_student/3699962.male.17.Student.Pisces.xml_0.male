I've only gone through 'the multiplier process' and 'equilibrium national income' of Macroeconomics - Theory of Income and Employment... Uh-oh.  It's times like these, I'm thankful that I'm not taking four A level subjects or any heavy subjects like Geography or History. Literature's all the reading and novels - something I wouldn't mind doing cause its one subject I really like. Math's all practice - so I'm hoping I can do well in that. Economics is a whole bunch of concepts to understand. Once I'm done with that. Yee-hah!  In the meanwhile, I just can't get myself started. I'm in for a whole lot of trouble if I don't start. It's not that I don't know it, it's just, I can't get started. Those who take Chemistry would know: There's just not enough activation energy!  (P.s. Life seems to be all about revision now huh... Sigh.)  Hoping God kicks me in my behind to give me a jumpstart, Sherm
