I was upset in the morning because we were supposed to go to the Hickory mall (that has Abercrombie  Hollister,) but we didn't ... so I was depressed and bored -- just sitting around the house. Then at about 3 we went to Birkdale, which lifted my moods. I got a lot of stuff:   AE:   urlLink Corduroy Jeans        and a messenger bag and sunglasses - no photos.  GAP:   urlLink Jean jacket       Pants- I am going to take back.  Old Navy:  Jeans - probably going to take back.   urlLink Canvas Backpack      -by the way- I am upset that it is on sale online, because I got it for full price in the store.  Then we went to dinner at  urlLink Hop's Restaurant and Bar . It was a pretty nice place ... It's has California stuff. It has it's own brewery in there - and we sat in a table right next to it and you can see the root beer and beer being brewed. It's neat. Like Bull Frog Brewery. The food was really good too. They have this bread that's kind of like sticky buns.  Tomorrow we are probably leaving ... at 1 we are going on this yacht in Lake Norman. I'll write more later. BYE
