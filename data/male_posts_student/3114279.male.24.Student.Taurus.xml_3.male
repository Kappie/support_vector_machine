      Oh, physics. That class is the bane of my existence. It forces me to use tired old cliches when describing it. Is tired old cliche a tired old cliche? I don't know. Anyway, my poor Senators were eliminated by the stinking Toronto Maple Leafs yesterday. Learn to use proper grammar, you CN tower bastards. It's   leaves  , not leafs. Morons. Anyway, this weekend is the last day of shooting for my T.A.P, including a scene with Nick and Ryan, an outdoor scene, and the infamous Punk Rock Amy scene. We'll see how it all goes.   On the other side of things, I met my opposite yesterday. Now, as all of those who know me know, I am in this premed thing to become a forensic pathologist. My reasons are trifold; first, I hate people, and this way I don't have to deal with people whining "my arm hurts," "I have a rash," "I can't breathe," or "I'm bleeding." Wah, wah, wah. This way nobody talks, and I don't have to listen to their trash. Secondly, I don't think I could deal with the pressure that my decisions could result in somebody living or dying. This way they come to me dead, they leave me dead, anything other than that happens and it's just a bonus. Third, I kind of want to one day be that old crusty pathologist you see in the movies, unshaven, eating a baloney sandwich, when the sheriff busts in and says "Shaheen, I don't like you and you don't like me, but we've got a killer on the loose and you're the only one with the know-how to stop him." So that's basically all laid out. This guy in a couple of classes starts talking to me the other day about how he wants to be a doctor not for the money, but so he can help people. He just loves people. He wants to do mission trips and crap. He says one of the greatest things he'd like to say to somebody would be "I'm sorry, but I can't help you anymore, but Jesus Christ can." Now, I don't know about you, dear reader, but that's about the goddamned last thing I'd ever want to hear come out of a doctor's mouth. Take two Jesi and call me in the morning. Fuck that! He said he wants to witness miracles. I told him I don't want to see any miracles in the morgue, or I'd high tail it out of there. Yikes.  Been on a Sergio Leone kick lately. One of the greatest filmmakers in history. His best film is easily Once Upon a Time in the West. Excellent.  Three people show up to meet Charlie Bronson at a train station, all of them with guns drawn. Charlie: "You bring a horse for me?" Bad Guy: "Looks like we're one horse short." Charlie: "No. You brought two too many."
