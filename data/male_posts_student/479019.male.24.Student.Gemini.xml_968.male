I had a dream that I was back in high school and two guys Joey T. and Jonathan F. came after me with knives. I was able to disarm them and beat some sense into them. I don't like dreams like this because I end up not getting much rest.  Now playing:  Alkaline Trio  - Continental  Anyway, it should be noted that I'll be getting a new cell and phone number soon. So check your emails for my new number.  I was talking to Steff last night about the sad state of world affairs, and I noted that 6.9 million adults were incarcerated or on probation or parole last year in the USA... 1.2 billion people in the world are living on less than $1 day. Sad huh? It gets even more messed up when you look at who these people who are getting locked up or starving are. They are essentially non-white people.   Now playing:  Social Distortion  - Backstreet Girl  Work today, day off tomorrow... happy happy joy joy...  ***
