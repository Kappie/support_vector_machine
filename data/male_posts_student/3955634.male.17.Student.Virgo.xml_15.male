In my spare time I write music reviews for a site called  urlLink 30music , and while working on the Tonic piece I figured I'd start on a fairly promising sounding group called Otasco. Two birds, one stone, you know how it goes.    Unfortunately, the following maelstrom of technological failures put a dent in my plans. After iTunes failed tolocate an artist or tracknames in the CDDB, I confusedly began playing the first track. Instead of music coming through the speakers, there was dead silence, and the "Time Elapsed" marquee failed to move in any direction.    Okay, so I've got a dud disk, I figured. No problem, just eject it and put in another for now.   It wasn't meant to be. First pushing the cute eject button in iTunes, followed by the one on the drive itself, there were no results. The little yellow light in the drive kept pulsating, all the while the mechanics inside whizzing and working, but the one thing I needed to happen was the one thing that wasn't  going  to happen. Even using the task manager function of Windows, I was unable to close iTunes or get that disc out.    But what about my big Tonic entry? I quickly copied the text, hoping to open NotePad or Word and save it as a file to come back to after a speedy reboot. Upon clicking the start menu, the entire screen froze up, and I sat there staring in horror. My work was gone and there was a CD stuck in the drive. Better yet, Windows entirely froze up, not a good sign for my general operations.    A few reboots later, here I am, and I sense the impending review for the Otasco disc is going to be shadowed in my bitterness towards its inability to work with a three year old computer.    And if it turns out that the failure of the disc to play was a result of some copy-protection scheme, you can bet the album's going to be getting a pretty abysmal score.
