And well, after a while, I decided to do it anyway, just for the heck of it. Maybe something cool will happen, you never know.  Ok, so let's start at the beginning.  It was very dark, I couldn't see anything at all. I also couldn't move much, like I was trapped somewhere, and there was noone there to help me. I was wet, but somehow felt warm. I have never expirienced this feeling before. After a while, I heard a woman screaming, I had no clue of what was going on, I was afraid. Then I saw a light, I started moving towards it, struggeling, still unable to move my arms and legs. The woman was still screaming. I stopped to rest for a while, and coincedentally, the woman stopped screaming... I slowly started moving towards the light again, inching my way through the narrow gap, until finally, I reached it! I was born.  Ok, laim joke...seriously, My name is Ryan, I'm 16 (for a month or so, turning 17 in august :D), and I live on a rock some people call Curacao, I like to call it hell. For those of you who've never heard of it, it's just off the coast of Venezuela, doesn't ring a bell? Maybe you've heard of Aruba. Yeah, it's right next to that... The reason I don't like this place, is there's nothing to do around here (for me at least), the island is filled with druglords, and phsycho killers, and on the entire island, there's not one decent computer store. Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad, We do have some nice sunny beaches, and there are tons of hot chicks here. and well, the laws aren't that strict here (which is why there are so many murderers and dealers). Moving on, we are a dutch colonie, therefore our native language is dutch. But ask any native, and they'll say it's papiamentu, a dialect created by slaves in the 1800's to communicate with eachother so their master could'nt understand them. Papiamentu is a mixture of allot of languages, mainly Spanish, Dutch and English.  Most people love it here, tourists want to come live here and natives never want to leave. Well I'm different, I never really fit in here. I can't wait to leave, and considering the lack of educanional facilities, I have to leave to go to college. I'm going to move to Holland in exactly 12 months and 17 days.  It's a quarter past eleven now, and I'm going to watch a movie (for all of you wondering, I'm going to watch "Timeline", and hope it's any good)  I'll be checking back here after the movie.
