I was supposed to be off tomorrow but because Stacy got his ass fired I have to work. Crystals mom thinks I'm evil, which I guess in some eyes I might be, but I don't think I'm evil. It all adds up and I've just been so....easily angered lately. I hate it, but lately, I just don't really know how to be happy. Every smile is forced, every laugh is fake. I have to go to work. 15 bloody hours today. I'll write more when I get home if I don't collapse from exhaustion first.
