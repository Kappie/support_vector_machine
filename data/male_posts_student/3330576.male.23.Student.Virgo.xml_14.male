It's like when you went to see Titanic (you know you did) and you know the ship will sink but it's about getting to that point in the plot.  That's how it is.  The NBA playoffs began like Mulholland Drive, hella interesting and mysterious, then it devolved into by-the-book Titanic.  Nothing more to say about this tonight...far too upset.  Damn, what the hell is that noise?  You know, I can't remember the last time I had a mixed drink.  Not counting that gin I was drinking with mineral water, but even that was back in October/November.  I think that the culture of Washington isn't conducive to mixed drinks.  There are no little ads on the bar walls for Stoli or Skyy, but instead miles of neon signage for Fat Tire and Labatt Blue.  I ought to order a Long Island Iced Tea next time I'm in a bar and see what sort of glance I get from the bartender.  Or better yet, a Fuzzy Navel.  Which makes me think of something...there should be a mixed drink called the Deee-Lite, after that one-hit wonder "band" with the woman wearing those crazy brightly colored outfits.  Wouldn't an electric yellow drink remind you of her and doesn't the name fit perfectly?  When I had the gin I coined the Tropical Goddess, which is gin plus Tropical Sprite Remix.  I think Deee-Lite ought to be gin, that Berry Sprite Remix and some yellow food coloring.
