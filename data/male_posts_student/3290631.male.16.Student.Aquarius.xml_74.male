I think that everyone should give this reporta look because it gives Americans the ultimate piece of mind when it comes to terrorism and how our country has responded to it, and how our country is prepared to respond to it in the future.  Personally, I don't watch ABC, NBC, FOX, CNN, or the other media conglomerates for my information on the safety of our nation.  They are part of the lies and the fear culture that Americans have created for themselves.  If you want to learn something for yourself about the enemies that our country faces today, and how our country is facing them, instead of letting a news anchor feed you their version, read the 9/11 Commission report.
