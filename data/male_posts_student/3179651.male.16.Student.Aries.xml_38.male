Ass. Hearing is voice before 12:00 makes me want to cry... My mom said I had 5 minutes to get ready and she wouldn't take me if I wasn't up and id have to stay home. Again, another Ass living in the house. Hmm, so being gay, of course I couldn't get fucking ready in 5 minutes so I stayed home. I was out again 10 minutes later and woke up around 2.   I don't know why I'm so tired.  Bean, did you give me Mono when you took the Tic-Tac off my tongue!?! You already gave someone an ear infection and me a sinus infection!
