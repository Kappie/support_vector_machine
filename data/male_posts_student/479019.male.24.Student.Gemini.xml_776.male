I simply didn't know all the new songs, because I hadn't bought the new CD yet. However, I got to talk to Frank briefly and buy their new CD. It was an alright show overall. Brandon and I then had some Del Taco and beer.  I didn't get to sleep until like 2 and I left for LAX at 4:30 to beat traffic. I had a 7:15 flight from LA to Pittsburgh, which left me stuck sitting next to a fidgety fat kid.  Inhye picked me up at the airport and we went to IHOP for dinner. Then I asked her for some grocery shopping help.  And here I am... back in my apartment.  ***
