My night last night wasn't as boring as it could have been. I finally got the chance to rent scarface, because every weekend i got to the blockbuster to find that movie...i knew exactly where it was. but every time i go there it's out...HA HA not today my confidant's. yeah, good ol Tony Montana, that guy is messed up...every time he see's his sister with a guy the same music comes on and it goes to a closeup of his eyes. it's like wee ooo wee ooo. then to lengthen the amount of time i would stay up until, i rented not one but TWO video games...just to keep me up for precious extra hours.   well, she's left for the athletic banquet. ha ha if only i hadn't told off what's her name genelle in like the last two days of the volleyball teams existence i would've been there...meh cause and effect "i drink too much wine, i must take a piss" that's from the second matrix...damn i have to stop remembering stupid little things like that. but yeah she will be missed over the internet. hmm...next weekend maybe...ooo imagine if we got together again. it could be quite the event. and imagine atleast one of us doesn't get too scare to say something...and you know...jeez you'd have to wonder. what would we do next or like would it change the way we talk to eachother? i sure as hell hope not. i think we're perfect right now...hanyways...i have to go to my sister's apartment, maybe alex will be there too...awesome!
