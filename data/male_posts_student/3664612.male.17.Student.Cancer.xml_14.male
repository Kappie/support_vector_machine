The reason why i hate it so much is that it takes up at least an hour, and because of that some shows get cancelled for the season. An example of this is the Simpson. Here in Australia they show the Simpson 2 times, but because of this Australian Idol they are only showing it once. God dammit, plus its just depressing seeing all those idiots who actually go to the audition just to have their 5 seconds of fame. I was watching it today and there was a lot of pathetic fuckers here in Australia. Jeez i just had enough of these Idol shows, this also includes some reality shows. For example: Temptation Island, The bachelor, Joe millionaire, Average Joe the list goes on. I mean sure the some shows are actually good like Survivor, or the Apprentice. But sometimes enough is enough. Well ill stop complaining for now. Back to reading for me xD
