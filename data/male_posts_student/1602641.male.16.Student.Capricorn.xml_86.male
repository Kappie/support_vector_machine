I received yet another from a cashier today and I examined it very closely. It is the EXACT same diameter as a US penny. Now all my gripes aside, I have a serious comment, Dear Canada, Please stop faking our pennies and step off b****! Thank You, US Money Enthusiasts Next order to rant on, those Barbadian quarters! I mean really, they are freakin' identical!
