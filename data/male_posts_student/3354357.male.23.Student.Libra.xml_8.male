They cant be anywhere at any time on any occassion- if they hear a Dashboard song they will sing along. (and most of them are completely tone def!)  The worst part is when they close their eyes and sing along (also usually accompanied with crying).   I just wanna throw something at them and laugh when they do that.  I just pray that I never have to drive next to a Dashboard fan on the highway because that is an imediate threat to my life if they close their eyes.  2.  When people leave songs on their voice mail message.  I hate this.  Yesterday I had to put up with this for like over 2 minutes.  I can somewhat stand maybe ten seconds but not the whole freaking song.  If any of you does this, trust me, NOBODY wants to hear the new song for whatever crappy band you listen to.  We just wanna leave you a message so dont punish us.  3.  Seperatist Christians. By this I mean the Christians that say that in order to be saved you must: not watch rated "R" movies, be republican, only listen to Christian music, and have absolutely NO non-Christian influinces.  Get real.. How are people going to know the message if you stay in your freaking bubble, just because you might get contaminated.  We learn by messing up, not trying to be perfect.  And putting a buber sticker on your car isn't evangalism.  4. Ann Coulture- By far one of the most annying things in the world.  People like this is why other countries hate us.    5. Youth pasters that are more obsessed with being cool not the gospel (they would usually fail at the "cool" part anyways).  I don't want to be asked one more time if "You down with G-O-D? yeah you know me."  I couldn't stand it when they used to tell us that we needed to be listening to cool "christian bands", that were usually second class rock bands.     6.  Ralph Nader.  This guy is a jerk.  Enough is enough.
