I hate my Broadcast Communications class with a deep burning passion....I wouln't actually kill them...I don't think I have that much hate in me....but.....I do with for a large majority to die horrible painful ways in a car accident perhaps.......God I'm evil....but that's what makes me fun....right?!?!?  I found that less people like me when I'm nice, but then I try to be nice to keep people close to me, but then I'm not fun anymore or sumthing.....MAN THIS LIFE IS MESSED UP!!!  For lack of a better name...I just named this one the letters on my keyboard...man I sure do get bored too easily!! and d recently I've been getting depressed really easily too...that sux....oh well....I just have to try and be positive ALL THE TIME.....that shouldn't be TOO hard right?!?!?!?!  I hope not Peace!  Spense
