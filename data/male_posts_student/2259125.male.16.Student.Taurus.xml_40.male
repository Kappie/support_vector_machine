He came over this morning and gave me these two cards he'd picked up at walgreens. My brother thought he was a salesman and wasn't going to answer the door. And I was still in my pajamas, so I had to pull on a huge thick freaking hot hoodie to go upstairs and peek out the window, because I thought that myabe by some weird coincedence it would be him, after what I'd just read two seconds ago on the blog.  And it was him. Stupid brothers. So he gave me the cards and I let him in and we talked for a few minutes and then he had to leave. And then my brother made some stupid comment (after he was gone) like, "he knows he has to come through me first, and dad. wow, that's like double! 'hey, you're in!'" Which was totally lame because it's not like he likes me or something. But my brother is kind of a moron like that early in the morning...  But it was hilarious, because I was reading what he wrote in one of them and it was something about puting up with his shananingans. See, I wrote him this long apology last night (actually this morning at like 1:00 am) and I said almost the exact same thing. So, it was funny to me.  I'm just glad to know that I have such good friends who are willing to deal with my ups and downs and my conspiracy theorist.  And most of all, I'm glad I have Sarah and her 'couples therapy.' Even though, we aren't a couple, it was good to work stuff out with Austin. Because without her, I wouldn't be talking to him currently. Which would be really stupid because he's leaving tomorrow for some boy scouts thing. (speaking of which, why is he still in boy scouts? he's 16 for crying out loud!)  And it's been really confusing after getting back from Costa Rica. I've lost a lot of things and I've found a whole lot more. But I don't know what to do with any of it. It's good to know that I have friends that are going to sit next to me on the roller coaster and hold my hand when it gets really bad. Because it will eventually. Costa Rica changed a lot, and as much as I wish, it's not going to go back to the way it was. But I think that's okay. Because, as always, God has it under control. We're just here to ride along and make the occasional choice about which ride we're going to next.
