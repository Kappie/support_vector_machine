I got the computer set up first thing, and now that I have access to the internet, it's going to be hopeless getting anything done. I just know Vegard is going to find himself a Chinese hottie and settle down in Nanching, never to return to the land of the midnight sun. Well, either a hottie or a dominatrix, a la Lucy Liu. It's getting right down to crunch time for me--next term begins on Tuesday. Weather's been great here, with sunny days and temps hovering around 0 Celsius. Not bad for January at all. So, as you've probably noticed, I haven't gotten around to posting my pictures on Walker's nifty website yet. And I've got such quality shots of Adam's mullet.   And now a little think piece for you. I was just pondering how strange it is what words in the English language were Latin-ized (Ulli, this doesn't count as making up a word) following the Norman invasion (by the way, the Normans were originally from Norway...those Vikings sure got around) and what words still maintain their Germanic roots. For instance, our names for the colors are not Latin at all, nor are our numbers. One would think such key words would be among the first to change. But I suppose if you really get down to it, maybe the words that the poor, English-speaking masses used on a daily basis were a bit harder for the Normans to change, while the elements of language used mainly by the educated were among the first to change. Even today it is really only highly educated English speakers who rely heavily on words and phrases borrowed from French. Or maybe that's absolute bubkus. Just something to ruminate over. Tune in next time for more interesting linguistic discussions. J/K...you'll have to excuse the former linguistics major for his hapless forays into the linguistic universe. Ta ta for now.
