      Yo yo yo. I am Glenn, an irritated person trying to pay some bills. Not like it's working. That's what I get for having too many online passwords. Watched Blade Runner again last night. I find it difficult to believe that even now, 22 years after it was made, with all of the so-called advances in cinema technology, that it would look any better. What an awesome fucking movie. I can't believe I don't own it. So I've decided to have people over to my house this weekend, since I no longer live in a disgusting prostitute infested hellhole. Should be pretty fun, although I don't really want the upstairs neighbors to call the cops, since we could be evicted for not alerting the landlord to our sublease. Meh. I figured at this late point in the week at least one interesting thing would have happened to me, but no dice. Just moving and class, and as of 7 o'clock today work. Yay. My favorite place. Not really. Well, catch you peeps on the flip flop. I have to go and try to start organizing for poetry club.  Glenn
