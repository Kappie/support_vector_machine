I completely sprinted at the end to the goal where a million people were roaring loud. It was the coolest feeling. But think, 46th overall of every age group from 1 - 100 years old. I came in 46th out of 400 people! There was the kid 1 mile fun run and the really big guy from our track team did it. He got up on stage with all the other little kids. Unfortunetly he never won anything.)= After the race I had a tooth pulled and a couple of teeth sealed by the Navy Seals. Ok, after this, must of been the most boring day of my life. Well... not really I went to the parade. Saw Mattia and Buchmann skating on the train tracks in St. James, screamed out their names but they didn't hear me because of the loud trucks. You guys are fuckin awesome. I was with my cousin Kate. We went to drop her off at her house when we found out Britt had been home alone with her 3 boyfriends!!! They're all ghetto fags. We saw one standing in the middle of the road when a car came by beeping, when the short little punk screams out fuck you to the car. I've talked to this gay kid on the phone before at my cousin's house just to make sure he's cool and shit, he's got the highest voice. He's from GH, I don't like the 8th graders at all. You little shits better watch out lol. You see just like yesterday, there's all these little gay punks who think they can take on anyone, even authority. So back to the rest of the day. Yea, thanks to Pat being Mr. Poop and being gone all day and thanks to Dan staying at J Lo's house all day, I did didley sqwat... well I slept all day. I woke up at night, ate french fries and apple sauce and decided to boggle Amanda G's mind by explaining THE MATRIX to her and how I believe it's true. That was fun. It's official, Amanda and I are running away together... we just don't no where yet. Hey Kate G, whats up with the away message, I know you look up to me and all but your away message, it was like if I typed it or something. Maybe we have the same minds. Wow.
