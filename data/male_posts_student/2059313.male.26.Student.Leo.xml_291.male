I've had three classes and none of them have gone anywhere NEAR the full time (which normally, I would love, but since I live relatively close to campus, I've been going home after class).  I had an 8:00am LAB that met for 15-20 minutes.  Awesome since it's scheduled for two hours.  So went home to wait for my 11:00 class.  It only went 10 minutes.  What a crock.  I just got out of my 12:30 class at 1:05 (supposed to go to 1:45).  This time I'm killing some time in a computer lab instead of making the 10 minute trek back home.  I only pray that my last class of the day doesn't make me feel like I've completely wasted my time.  I'll let you know.
