Know your place in life is where you want to be  Don't let them tell you that you owe it all to me  Keep on looking forward, no use in looking 'round  Hold your head above the ground and they won't bring you  down    Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind  A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind  We marvel after those who sought  New wonders in the world, wonders in the world,  Wonders in the world they wrought    Live for yourself -- there's no one else  More worth living for  Begging hands and bleeding hearts will  Only cry out for more    Well, I know they've always told you  Selfishness was wrong  Yet it was for me, not you, I  Came to write this song    Well, I just felt like putting  that. Anyone has something to say about it, go ahead, although I'll doubt that anyone'll care what it means.
