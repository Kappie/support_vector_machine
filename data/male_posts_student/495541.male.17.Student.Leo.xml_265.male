I was specifically reading from Matthew where Jesus was teaching from the mountainside.  Reading the Bible, I got inspired to write in this.  I had the pages bookmarked from last Sunday in church.  I was flipping and I found the page because it's lit up in red.  My version of the Bible had red to denote when Jesus speaks.  The entire page is in red.  I had to read it.  So I read most of it.  Tonight I came back to those pages and looked a the bold face type.  My Bible has headings for the parts of his teachings.  There are several topics he teaches about.  For examples... Adultery, Divorce, Oaths, Love for Enemies, Giving to the Needy, Treasures in Heaven, Do Not Worry.  All of these very intersting topics, I though.  As I reread them I began to realize that all of these things Jesus is teaching, the opposite seems to be true of today.    "You have heard that is was said 'Eye for an eye, and tooth for tooth.'  But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person.  If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also." - opposite true today.  People want revenge.  "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven." - opposite true today.  People hate their enemies and wish they were dead.  "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.  But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.  For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." - opposite true today.  Material posessions are all the rave... bling bling this and bling bling that.  "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes?  Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?  Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?" - opposite true today.  People are picky about what they eat, and drink.  People are picky about what they wear.  People constantly worry about these things.  "Do not judge, or you too will be judged.  For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." - opposite true today.  People constently judge each other... just read the newspaper, watch the news, or listen to people talk!  (These quotes were from  urlLink Matthew 5-7 )  These are just a few things I thought were interesting.  It's pretty ironic that of all these teachings, the absolute opposite is true today.  What does that say about our society?  I think it shows we all have lack of God in our life.  Myself included.  I say... I should read this amazing book more.
