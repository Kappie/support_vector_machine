Let’s talk a little media bias here. The media, I think, wants Kerry to win. And I think they’re going to portray Kerry and Edwards -- I’m talking about the establishment media, not Fox, but -- they’re going to portray Kerry and Edwards as being young and dynamic and optimistic and all, there’s going to be this glow about them that some, is going to be worth, collectively, the two of them, that’s going to be worth maybe 15 points."   Evan Thomas is the Assistant Managing Editor of Newsweek.   urlLink More.   I don't think all the media is liberal, or that it is consistently liberal all the time, or that every reporter is liberal, or that the general media is so liberal that nothing said by the media can be believed.  Nevertheless, this is interesting.
