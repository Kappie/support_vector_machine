My birthday is on friday and quite alot of people would be celebrating it, chin han, woon han, ben, XY, Pris, Stella as well as many others, planning to go sakae sushi chiong. I've seriously never had a real birthday celebration in my entire life, real as in, like.........i mean, real...........This year would probably be the first, with so many people and all. And yah, i've injured my pinky on my left hand, so that means no guitar for probably a good part of this week, i played piano just now, still pretty okay, cos' i gotta bend my pinky more for guitar...............and this injury is pretty irritating, not to mention painful at times, i have to bathe with my right hand most of the time......only when bo pian then use the left.   Hmm, i can seriously say that my "gan chu" (感触) for this week has not been really alot. I've not really been thinking about logical stuff or really had much experiences where my love life is concerend. In short, my week has been pretty mediocre at best. And also that bloody sun, expect us to copy 5 ke within one day with a physics test on the next day.............in the end no one copy.........expected,........he still thinks that teaching in China is the same as teaching in Singapore.  Yah, come to think of it, for my subject combination, i may be thinking of dropping to sub science, i don't think I can cope that well in pure science. My physics is relatively ok, but my chem is killing me. Besides, stories where pure science students drop to sub-science and got A1s for their O's is pretty encouraging. I think my school kinda sucks. The best class is more science-focused. If I could, i'll probably take E-lit, Pure History, combine humans., English, Chinese, Combined Science, Amaths and Emaths. I love amaths but i hate emaths.   I'm working on an essay regarding feminism now, and It'll probably be up in a few days time...........
