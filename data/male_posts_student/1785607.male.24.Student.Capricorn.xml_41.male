This is a movie I was waiting for a long time, and I was oh so not disappointed.  Now, just a warning, please don't leave the movie theatre with the same fixation that ruined " 28 days later " for most of the people that saw it: The gore.  Kill Bill: vol. 1  is gory, but so much fun to watch. I try not to get technical, 'cause maybe I'm not good at it, I'll just say this: the edition is perfect, the art is great, the movie is elegant, fast passed, a great representation of pop culture.  Uma Thurman as "the bride" is great. Strong, powerful, and sexy. All the female characters hold the flick together and even though you don't get to see more than a hand from David Carradine, just let me tell you that if his part in Vol. 2 is as powerful as it was in Vol. 1 ... WOW! Now the members of DiVAS ( Deadly Viper Assassination Squad ) are great, Liu, Fox, Hanna y Thurman are just great... If this movie would've been done by someone else and with other actors, it would've ended as a B flick just made for idiots... They give great performances, specially Thurman, but all of them have a strong impact when they appear. Even though the movie opens with Thurman, we get a great background on the Lucy Liu character, O-Ren Ishii, but we get it in the form of an anime, which prevented the NC-17 classification. Now I could get all fancy with words in this review, but the hell with it, I'm not a professional, is not like anyone here comes to read my reviews to decide either they'll see it or not, so, with that in mind, I'll tell why I liked it:     1. The girls kick ass... I want to get whipped by any of them... I'm gay, duh! So that's how good they look. 2. Uma kicks ass. 3. Lucy kicks ass. 4. Vivica kicks ass. 5. Darryl kicks ass. 6. The best line and the story to get to it is great, the line been:  "This my finest sword. If in your journey you should encounter God, God will be cut."  7. David Carradine as Bill (so far so good). 8. The fight on the Japanese garden (elegant, solemn, exquisite). 8. Julie Dreyfus as Sofie Fatale is great. 9. Go Go Yubari ( Chiaki Kuriyama ), what a bitch... but so good. 10. An all around chick flick made for boys... now, as my mama said one day:  "we have balls, but ours are way up than yours, and they are bigger"   You know what, just go an see the damn movie, IS GOOD...!!!
