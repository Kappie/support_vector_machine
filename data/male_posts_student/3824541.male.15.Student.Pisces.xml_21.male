I got an idea for a good scene today :). I've had a few in the last few days, but I like this one the best. I'm not exactly how the scene will play into the story, but I think it'll weave its way in well. Tongue twister back there. Anyways, hmm, now that I think about it, it's not exactly a scene. It's more of like a character. A girl who has tried her whole life to be beautiful with hundreds of diets, makeup, and so on. Her tragic flaw is that yearn to be beautiful.  Today: Jason came over for awhile. It was kinda boring because we didn't know what to do. We finally decided to go the pool. Ehh ;/, I haven't been to the pool in ages so I went. I need to make the swimteam next year. Later I mowed the grass, and after that I went driving which rocked. There was one part though where I stopped short trying not to hit a bird, and the two cars behind me stopped short. -_-  Tonight is also... THE RADIO! Woo! If you don't know about 'The Radio' listen in tonight at 10 CDT if you have highspeed with the following link: http://synaptic.creativeirc.net:8000/listen.pls. I hope Bobby, Brittney, Becca, and Erin will be on. Last night Becca and Brittney and Bobby and me were arguing and not speaking, but voila! Today we are.  Bobby's still acting strange though. He seems to have an attitude with everyone =\. Then there's Becca who called me while I was driving, and I told her I was busy.  So, I'll update you later.   .Characters   Jason  - Really good friend of mine in IL.  Bobby  - Best friend ever; like a brother to me. Lives in FL.
