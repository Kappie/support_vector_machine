She just saw my mouth move. Wow, anyways lunch detention wasn't that bad because we got to, yes we, many people get it every day. Actually only one person got it today. Anyways, we got to watch all the saxists audition and they were all like comedians except Paul, he was the only serious one. Rob Haber said "My mom is a cheap Jew, she buys these $1 reeds right to Ms. Kalabza's face! AND HE DOESN'T GET IT TROUBLE!? I quit life. It's too confusing. Oh, well...at least it's over with. Rob also farted alot, he even told Ms. Kalabza he farts when he's nervous. Uh, yea school sucked today. Wait, no, scratch that...English was a killer...for your mouth and stomache, the whole class was dying laughing. There was a sub, and he used a potium and we got to get our textbooks and when we came back he put on some dvd that taught kids how to eat lunch properly. The movie was from like 1930 something, it was crazy. We were all dying of laughter, not knowing what the hell it was for, not even the teacher knew. Turns out he didn't read the part of the note from Ms. B that said we were supposed to watch a different thing on the dvd. We all that it was Ms. B's punishment to us for making fun of Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails...NIN, NINE...moon ninny? That was in my dad's hand held dictionary. I remember all the funny words we looked at when I was around 5, oh good times. The tape had this puppet named Mr. Bungle that was doing all the wrong things and the guy must of said a million times, PHIL SURE ISN'T A MR. BUNGLE. Phil was this little kid that did everything right and used a gallon of soap to wash his hands. God, it was pretty torturous yet hilarious. Ok, enough school, what happened after school? NOTHING. Just went to Cornett, and I broke my favorite cd, my Tool AEnima cd but I'm going out soon to get a new one with my babysitting money! w00t. Also, I'm going out to dinner, and I have to work out with Paul, and I haven't even started my homework yet, well a bit of math but that's it. I'm doomed! Mwuahahaha. Bye.
