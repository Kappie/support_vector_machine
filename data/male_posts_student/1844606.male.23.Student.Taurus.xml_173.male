Anyways, 3 years ago I fell in love for the first time, as in more than a crush or some sort of pipe dream.  At a Weezer show.  (I reserve the right to revise history if I in fact become a metal god later in life).  That said, three songs into the set, the Eagles Ballroom was bending under the weight of 2,000 kids singing along in perfect dual harmony, in mid hop I looked right and connected with her eyes.  Time stood still blah blah blah and then we both fell to the floor, trampled under eager pushing to rush the stage.  Oddly enough, a mere year later, roughly around the same date, I had the worst 3 day ordeal of my entire life and will, for so long as I live, have a burning passion of hatred for Iowa City, the University located there, and the types of people I was surrounded by.  I remember these dates not because I have a particularly good memory, but because I rarely forget a concert I go to- (still able to remember the first one I ever saw Oct 5 1996 Smashing Pumpkins with Grant Lee Buffalo at the Rosemont Horizon) and there are elements I deeply miss, not of the particular lady, just the illusion of thinking that someone cared and I had something to be excited about.
