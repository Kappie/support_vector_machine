Last night I added a webcam link which shows a latest snapshot taken by my webcam.  It isn't a live feed or anything like that, just like a little ever-changing picture of something from my webcam!  Anyway, the link can be found over thar...    Anyways, hope all me mates are having fun at school while I sit here bored and woozy :o)
