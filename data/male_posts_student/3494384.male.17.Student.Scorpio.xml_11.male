I told him how I felt about the break up and stuff... It was all so sudden that I told him all these... We were having a very good chat when I erupted and told him all that... I told him that Willy is better than him in alot of ways. I told him that I feel that he is heartless and all... I asked him several questions...   Do you still have feelings for me?  He said: A little.  Do you cried because of the break up? He said: No. I was.  I almost cried... After that we hang up... He told me: I hope you can find someone better than me. I told him: I will always love you.   He said he like us to be friends only... I dont mind... I must say that he is a great friend... But... I dont know... I really love him... A one-sided love will never blossom...   -----  Whitney Houston - I will always love you  If I should stay, I would only be in your way. So I'll go But I Know I'll think of you every step of the way.  And I will always love you I will always love you. You, My Darling You...  Bittersweet Memories, That is all I am taking with me. So, goodbye. Please don't cry. We both know I'm not what you-you need   And I will always love you, I will always love you  I hope life treats you kind. And I hope you have all you dream of. And i'm wishing you joy and happiness. But above all this- i'm wishin you love.  And I will always love you. I will always love you. I will always love you. I will always love you.  I will always love you I will love-you... You, darling I love you. Ooh I'll always, I'll always love you.   -----  I guess that I really cannot get over him... This song is very nice... I cried non-stop after listening to this...   But life have to move on... Tomorrow... I mean now... Today... Im going out with Wan Xin, Wenfong and Xinhui... Wan Xin and Wenfong are my newly engaged brides :) I love you guys! Wenfong and me are gonna go do our hair together... How exciting... :) And we will have some sushi for our lunch... Wow!

Gathering with my buddies again, play and eat and play and eat... Get home around 11 plus...   I just fall out with Alan... I guess he is mad at me for that I keep giving excuses to not go out with him... He didnt replied me in MSN. He's a nice guy... Gonna make him my friend again if I dont want to lose him...
