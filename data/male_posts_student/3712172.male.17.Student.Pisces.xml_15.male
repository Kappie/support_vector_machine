He just had to take the movie with him too. I'm making a big deal out of this, but  seriously , I want to see that damn movie! Everytime I seem to have a chance to watch it, fate stands in my way. (Bit of exaggeration, LOL)  We compromised anyway. Andy, Robyn  I watched Mrs. Doubtfire and ordered pizza. The only drawback was that it was Pizza Hut, which isn't  ALL  that bad, I suppose, but they were the only ones in town with the portable debit machine. I am the kind of person who never has cash on them, and if I do, it's maybe a twenty dollar bill.  Funniest thing, I ordered a 2 litre of Pepsi as well, and when the pizza guy handed it to me, it was all wet and it flew out of my hands, fell down my front stairs, rolled down the sidewalk, and barely reached the road. I felt like a complete idiot. But fuck, dry the damn bottles (Haha!)  I have a fairly long day ahead of me, I am actually going to goto bed at a decent hour tonight. I am going to pop into the hospital tomorrow and visit with some people and do a bit of volunteering, as it was my co-op placement during second semester. I loved working with the children, gave me a lot of insight on being a paediatrician.  This stupid insurance telemarketing scam keeps calling my cell phone (how they got my number I have no idea). I have been dealing with it for nearly 6 months now and everytime they call I tell them to put me on their "Do Not Call" list, but that never works. Anyways I was out for a smoke with some friends at work and my phone started to ring and it was a BC number (604-550-7000). I answer and it turns out to be some British guy. He was really rude too, kept trying to probe my name and what not. He kept mis-pronouncing it as well. I got really snarky back to him and told him to quit fucking calling my cell phone as his company wastes my daytime minutes. After flipping on him for a bit he asks me if I am on any sort of medications (because of my attitude towards him). I then replied  "Yeah buddy, I'm fucking stoned on drugs"  and he says  "Yeah I figured so".  Fucking moron, nice interpersonal skills there. No wonder you waste your time calling me everyday. Everyone got a laugh out of that one including myself.  I think I need a cigarette... *lights one up . I should really stop. It's so hypocritical of me to even consider a career in medicine if I smoke. I do plan to quit before I graduate next year. My dad went on Zyban and was successful, I plan to try that.  Well it's late I should get going.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site    *Sigh* Life is so philosophical.
