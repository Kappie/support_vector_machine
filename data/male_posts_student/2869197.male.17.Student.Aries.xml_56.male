I loathe governmental action because it is  always  ripe with bureaucratic illogic and overcost. Normally, nothing would exemplify that kind of law better than my school's law about no eating in the classrooms. There is scientific studies that prove well fed people learn better. On a more selfish note, eating in classes allows me to sell chocolate for my summer mission trip to Mexico. But this certain law is a paradox. If I break it, it negatively reflects on the teacher, which can only be bad for him. Those that know me know that I hate insulting or harming people in any way. If my nonaction will assist you better, even if it harms me in the long run, I won't budge. I feel a sense of shame for my actions. They could have harmed my teacher, a great sin in my book (or Book). Yes, even the authorities can cause this old antistatist to cringe in shame.
