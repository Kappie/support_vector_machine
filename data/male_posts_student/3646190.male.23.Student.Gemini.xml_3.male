The easiest one was Moore's softness on the Democrats--the democrats are the reason the war on Iraq and the war on terror have become legitimate. Without the support of the Dems the war could not have happened. It is sad that most people leaving the theatre will end up voting for Kerry--a man who wants to send 40,000 more troops to Iraq and escalate the war on terror--it is reminiscent of LBJ in Vietnam, and we all know the price Americans and Vietnamese civilians paid in that American imperial escapade.  When the movie discussed civil liberties in the US, I also notice that Moore did not mention the discrimination against Muslims and Arabs which really angered me, but then I took a step back and gave him the benefit of the doubt. It seems this movie was geared towards Americans specifically, to say to them: that not only are "other" people being screwed by American policies, but so are YOU. In that framework the movie becomes all the more powerful and relevant. He was appealing to people's self-interest which I can support to an extent. The movie did have an element of internationalism when he showed the carnage in Iraq and the suffering the occupation has caused.    I think the most powerful part of the movie for me was the beginning when members of the House of Rep. could not find one Senator to cosign their statement. I do not know what it will take the American people to see that the current political system has failed, but that was as powerful as any image or moment. Again the role the Democrats played in the Senate is worth paying attention to--they are supposed to be the party of opposition.
