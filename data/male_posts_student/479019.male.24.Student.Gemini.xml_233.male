Honestly... if I wasn't saving $2000 per semester in tuition, I wouldn't have given up my California residency. Oh well...   I also managed get about 80 pages read today at the library. I did it in about 2:30 hrs... which is much more than what I got done last night at home. I think I should read at school more often. Tonight I plan on finishing the Marxism and Law book and getting to the Hunt book.  A grilled cheese sandwich awaits me...  ***
