Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine. Woo-hoo, and that's for all the time.  [chorus] Woo-ee-oo, I look just like Buddy Holly. Oh-Oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore. I don't care what they say about us anyway. I don't care 'bout that.   Don't you ever fear, I'm always near. I know that you need help. Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit. You need a guardian.  Woo-hoo, and you know I'm yours. Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine. Woo-hoo, and that's for all the time.  [chorus] I don't care 'bout that.  Bang! Bang! Knock on the door, another big bang, you're down on the floor. Oh No! What do we do? Don't look now but I lost my shoe. I can't run and I can't kick. What's a matter babe, are you feelin' sick? What's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you? What's a matter babe, are you feelin' blue? Oh-oh-oh!  And that's for all the time. (x2)  [chorus] I don't care 'bout that. (x3)
