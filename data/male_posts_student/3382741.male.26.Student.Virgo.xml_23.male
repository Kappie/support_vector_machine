I had forgten how much I like the feel of something on my wrist (I had stopped wearing thing there for the very silly reason that it messed up my tan, lol).  I also find it nice to wear something of his ... reminds me ever more of him (not that he wasn't already in my thoughts all the time).  I think I need to get me a new watch.  I used to go for the bigger digital ones with all the features ... but I am thinking something small and elegant would be nice (tho it will still have to be digital since it takes me so long to read an analogue that by the time i read it ... it's a different time.  OF course I still don't have any money.  I will get another $300 (aprox) check next Friday (week from today) and I don't have a lot of bills due out of that check ... but I am prety far behind on my gas card (the minimum was made but I want to pay it off every month).  Plus car insurance will come of it ... AND I know that my next check will be smaller dure to the help desk being open less hours during summer break.   :::sigh:::  I need a better job or a lot more hours ... or both.
