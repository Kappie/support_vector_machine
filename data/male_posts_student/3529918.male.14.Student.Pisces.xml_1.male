No whales,  dolphins or salmon but lots of ice! We went up to the top of the mountain  in a tram and looked for wildlife, just saw a squirrel...and a very sick  eagle in a cage at the Raptor Center : (Richie said it must be an  ’illegal!’ There's always something to smile about when going on a cruise.  They can't promise everything!     We boarded the bus in Vancouver for Seattle in hopes of another great adventure...the remainder of our trip home by AmTrak!   When the bus from Vancouver got us to the border of the US, customs made the  driver unload 50 people's luggage and we had to cart it inside for X-ray  again...after we'd just been X-rayed many times on the ship! Can't be too  careful, donchaknow? Fifty Grampa and Gramma's you know...just can't be too  careful!   When we arrived in Seattle we transferred from bus to train. More hassles with the luggage! That meant he had to handle the two pieces of luggage per person once again! Talk about work up a sweat…the driver was ragged by this time…he really earned his pay!    Our experience with AmTrak was all down hill from there! We were stalled  off track for 8 hours in the mountains of N. California while other ‘more  important’ shipments came through (as we were on borrowed tracks of Union  Pacific!) Richie thought the ride had finally gotten smooth, but we were  just parked on a siding : )   The toilets stopped up on the mountain because of altitude problems. This made our usual middle of the night pit-stop an adventure in itself!   The train, when it was running ‘rattled and rolled’ like a ship  tossed at sea. It was ancient...not like the new trains we've ridden to  Capistrano to visit the Mission.   Cell phones wouldn't work cuz we were so isolated there was no signal, so  nobody could contact family or friends as to what was going on or when to  pick them up at midnight. different places in North County.   The dining car ran out of some preferred food…like milk! : (   Prepare yourself...It gets worse!   In Oakland some gangland *sniper* shot the engine of the next train ahead of us  (nobody was injured) so we were delayed another few hours for that  investigation. It made looking out the windows a kind of scary proposition from there on!.    By this time when we heard the announcement over the loud speakers everyone  on the train laughed hysterically! Like, what else can go wrong? Well,  stick with us!   There were 50 of us from the cruise trip and all were over 50…some well over 50! Not all were capable of navigating the aisles of the train very well. Much less climbing the narrow, steep stairs to the dining cars. Again, I'm coming home with black and blue hips from hitting the narrow hallway walls!   Many could not get out of their sleeping rooms (and I use that term loosely)  The Sleepers were the size of a regular dining booth at Encinitas Cafe! And  there were two of us in it, if you can imagine. The top bunk (for Dick) was  hard as a rock and the bottom bunk had ‘sections’ that didn't fit my  ’sections’ : )   Meanwhile, the brush fires that burned thousands of acres in San Luis Obispo had burned a train trestle, so that meant that we would be dumped out of the train...(luggage and all...yes, again!) and bussed to Los Angeles Union Station, where nobody  met us to help with the luggage or tell us all where to go. We could have  told them where to go for sure!   I overheard someone say *it costs the same to enjoy the trip or not enjoy  it... It's each individuals choice.* So we just got better acquainted with  our ‘old ship mates’...women dragged out handwork, men dragged out their mystery  novels, and another gal (Stella) taught us how to play Snap Bo, a card game which was  a lot of fun! And we ate a lot of ice cream!   Our checked luggage didn't make it to Solana Beach where we got off, but  went to Oceanside, so we'll have to go pick that up! When we left home we  were living out of four pieces of luggage...by the time the train ride ended  we were reduced to everything absolutely needed in my purse : ) One section I called ‘the office’ one section I called ‘Rx’ the other one I dubbed miscellaneous!   After a whole cruise to Alaska with no seasickness, the minute my feet hit  terra firma in Solana Beach, after the rocky AmTrak ride, I got lopsided! My  head began to reel and spin and I recognized it as the old familiar Mal de  Mer...but without a cruise! Am I weird or what?     So, we're a day late and a dollar short (including tips for the AmTrak people...it asn't their fault!) well, actually 12 hours late...but when *late* on a rickety train...who's counting : )   All in all, it was an adventure! This just gives *grist for the mill* to  write stories about! That will be my next project! Along with my scrapbook and our great pictures of Alaska!   Howevah...right now we are just very sleep deprived! Talk to you later  after we catch some zzzzzzsss!   We're blessed to be back!
