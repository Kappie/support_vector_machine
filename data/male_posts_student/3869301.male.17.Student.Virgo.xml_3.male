I talk about them, or at least think about them, alot. I hate that. There has never been anything that has rasied my feelings to either of those extreams. I use the words, but I don't mean them. I guess I love my family. You're kind of suppost to or something like that. I have pined, loathed, lusted, and cursed but never loved or hated. So many people I know who are my age have told me that they have felt love or hate. I often wonder whether or not they really have. If so I don't know why I haven't. Maybe it is because I just don't give people the chance. Maybe it is because I don't give myself a chance. Maybe I have loved or hated and just don't know...  Show me love/ Show me what it's all about  I liked Catwoman for it as a movie that you go in with kind of low expectations and come out saying, "That was okay enough." At least I can say that it was better than what the hick with an awesome mullet I was behind in the line for tickets said about it with a deep woods twang, "Catwoman? I heard that movie succccks."  About one quarter of the book left for Watership Down. Awesome book. I will have a review up soon maybe if Andy gives me more than just my blog. There will be a psydo review in the blog though. I have a bet going that I will finish it before my sister finishes reading Catch-22. She has been reading that book for about two months now.
