I'm really unsure what they are planning to achieve through this attack, because any attack they bring is just going to make it that much harder for those in the middle east and harder for muslims worldwide.   America is a wonderful place to live and our people, for the most part, are peace loving individuals who DO NOT want to give up the conveniences of living in this country.... Right now, American people don't want innocents in the Middle East to be harmed because of a fraction of extremists. But if these extremists keep on killing our innocents, which will lead to a nation of people who are scared, scared for their lives because of what these religious nuts claim is work in the name of "Allah", if they keep it up, you can kiss the Middle East goodbye. This country will never appease to the terrorists. We have it too good here. Leaders in the middle east had really better be recognizing this, because a couple more attacks on US soil, there won't be a middle east to lead. The US is not Spain. We aren't going to pray for peace when nut jobs blow us up. We're going to go on the offensive. And a couple more attacks, no one here is going to give a shit how many Middle Eastern women and childern are killed by our nukes, because we will be trying to protect our own.
