If you haven't read any of his past "20 Questions With Judges..." features, you're missing out on something very cool.  I hadn't read any until this past Wednesday, when I read them all in one sitting and then felt bad because I should have been doing something more productive.  But they're really interesting.  I'll catch the Posner Q tomorrow, since I'm on a mission to get 10 hours of sleep tonight and only have 15 minutes to go before that becomes unlikely.  Quick acrostic poem  Studying is easier when you don't Lie down and fall asleep Every time you open a book Every time you turn a Page.
