Sounds pretty boring, huh? Don't want to bore anybody with talk of my thesis, so moving on...it's just cool to say things like "my thesis" beacuse I sound more educated.  My parents are leaving Tuesday for two weeks to go to Canada for vacation. So far living at home for this year is working out nicely, they don't bother me too much. It'll be nice to have some time alone though. I think I'll try and invite some ladies over if you know what I'm saying. At 23 years old, I can use the line, "so, my parents are out of town..." Classic. I feel like a kid again. But seriously, I'm going to have a great party! I'm going to invite over my prostitute girlfriend and she's going to bring all her prostitute friends with her! We'll then get all the guys I know over here, charge for sex, and I get to take money for the house! What a great entrepruenerial scheme old chap!  My dog is teething. Dog bites hurt. Glad she bites my parents instead of me...oh wait they are going out of town, crap.  I'm going on vacation in August to Destin, FL. Ryan and hopefully some other people will go-- who really wants to be stuck with that just that TOOL on a vacation alone, that would blow! Too bad Landry is an ass and is going with a non-girlfriend girl to Florida instead of us, I thought we was boys Landry!!  Anyways, that's enough for now. Shoutout to Rob, my blog kicks your blog's ass.   Peace.  Alex
