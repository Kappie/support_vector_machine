I'm off at 2 so that gives me a lot of time afterwards to do stuff. But not with my gf cause she probably works at 3 so it would be kind of pointless to spend 5 mins with her and then have to leave... grrrrrr  Maybe i'll reorganize my room. That should take about 30 years. This place is a frickin mess. *looks around* my computer barely fits on my desk there so much stuff on it!!!  My best friend got me my birthday present today. He got me Spiderman 2 for gamecube. It's pretty cool. I've played it on his x-box so i kind of know what to do already but when i get further it will be more interesting. Sarah's gonna wait until my birthday to give me my present... i don't mind... i like waiting for good things :D at least i'll get to see her on friday for a while before she ahs to go to work... at least that's what i'm planning. What i plan and what actually happens are sometimes two different things... *sigh*
