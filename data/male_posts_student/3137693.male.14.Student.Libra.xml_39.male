I literally carry it around and i take pictures of things i find interesting on that day, its located on the right side of this page. You should check it out, I will also have daily updates. And hey! i got a NEW Guestbook! I've been looking for a new one with a simple setup, i finally found it. So go ahead and post a comment.  Peace
