Jay Leno pointed out the strange corrolation between the moral degredation of modern society and the Hollywood box office(I can hardly say that I'm suprised...), seeing as how the #1 film has gone from Mel Gibson's  Passion of The Christ , a movie about the prophet of the prodominent religion in this country, to  Dawn of The Dead , a movie about The undead, to perhaps the proverbial bottom of the barrel, at least title-wise,  Hellboy . Jay asked "Is America moving in the right direction?".  Never mind that Hellboy (Ron Pearlman) actually fights for "The Good Guys" in the movie, the undertones speak for themselves, Re-incarnation of The Nazi Regime.  The questions that come to mind are: is America becoming evil? are the finer points of The Christian faith lost on a generation obsessed with killing and pre-marital sex? can you blame them when the icon of our great nation enjoys blowing the crap out of third -world countries for shits and giggles?  This media-frenzy should reach full power right about the time  Kill Bill Vol. 2  is released so all I can say is God bless America...God bless America indeed.
