So I got to thinking...what the CRAP am I going to do with my time?  See, I developed this nasty thing called a guilty conscience very early in my youth, and I've had trouble kicking it ever since. And part of this foul demon that lives in the far too outspoken part of my mind tries to force me to be productive every day, despite the yearnings of my less powerful, carefree nature that never had much fostering as I matured.   But for once, just once, I want to spend some time for myself. No school, no expectations, no worries about what lies ahead. I just want to take two months out of my life, and be nothing but me. Sure, I'll know that at the end of August I'll probably be going right back to the academic grind, but until then, I don't want any reminders. I want to write, sing, dance, train, act, and feel uninhibited for roughly 50 days, and then maybe I'll be able to come back with a clearer mind, and a stronger motivation.   Oh yeah, and I want to be a movie star. Did I mention that already? I figure after donning a cape and mask in The Warden, I can take on anything. :P  And on that note, it's time for dinner.....
