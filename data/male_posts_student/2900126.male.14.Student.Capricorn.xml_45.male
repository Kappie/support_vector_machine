Or maybe it's because you are so familiar with them and you are around them so much that they are so tempting?   Most people because they can't have someone or something want it more and more because they know they can't have them/it.  For example ( this example will be hilarious to some and confuseing to others) Elizabeth Anderson knows she can't have E.Z. and yet she constantly goes after him and protects his as is he were her child. *no offense Chichi and Erich, but it's true* Many people have told me of a certain fiasco at Central Park and Kiara took Erich's cell phone and then Elizabeth started to chase her and try to get it back, knowing that in her efforts to do that it wouldn't change the way Erich felt or I should say didn't feel about her.     I guess it will always be a mystery as to why people want the things/people that they know they can't have. But for a select few they get that person/thing that they want. * Yippee! for them*
