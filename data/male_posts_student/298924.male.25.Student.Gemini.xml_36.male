I got on the road about 4 PM Nashville time riding with my friend Tiffany B....the ride was pretty great...Jay Z got us the majority of the way there....I also realized that "Rock the Boat" is fast becoming one of my all time favorites....and of course I can never ride with Tiff without listening to R. Kelly's latest....I loves it....  Got to Atlanta about 9 or 10 local time(I think we made good time)....went to Walmart and got a few items and then headed directly to Hard Rock Cafe....the first person I saw was my boy Farai....kind of fitting given that Tiff and I had just mentioned him....it hit me right then how happy I was to be back among my lifelong friends....I get in line at Hard Rock and all of a sudden I see too many people....so many people I can't greet them all at once....it kind of overwhelmed me....  As the night went on it got better and better....I saw my girl Brandy as soon as I entered the actual building....I had seen my boys Raj, Darrell, and Kasi in line....by the end of the night I had seen just about everyone I cared about except my MAIN crew....  I decided that despite the fact that it was 3 AM I was determined to see my boys so I called them up and B. Clayton was the only one awake....but I went anyway....it made my night....of course I still hadn't seen my best friend, my dawg, my oldest friend, Eulus....  Next day I wake up and go work out at Tiffany's APT. complex's very nice CardioTheatre (wonderful concept)....then she dropped me off at my boy Danny's crib....man....elated is not the word to describe how I felt seeing my boys....when I say we have been through it all, I mean it....but thick and thin, beef or not I can count on them and they are my heart....but I still hadn't seen Eulus....  I get to the campus and we walk to the tailgate and then finally in a very anticlimatic fashion we just so happen to run into Eulus....at that point my homecoming came full circle....the cipher was complete....all that was left for me was to see my family....I don't think Tiffany could understand that....she kept talking about how she had a set agenda last weekend during Hampton's homecoming....her situation was different....for me, Morehouse is a true Homecoming....Atlanta is my home....I didn't come to party and drink....I wanted to see my friends and family....  I saw my little sister, Che, and she gave me my tent pass....I'm so proud of my sister, no matter where she is or what she does she is a natural....I saw her at that stadium and it was like she belonged there....it has always been like that for her....I see her and it's like she was always meant to be there....so she gives me my tent pass and I head over to the tent....  It never fails that I run into one of my mom or dad's old friends and they always comment about how much I've grown and they always express shock at whatever great endeavor I am involved in....I can only imagine what it will be like to see the little kids I know now go on to succeed....it must be a good, yet frightful feeling to them....  It was great seeing my Pops....I call Eulus my best friend and he truly is.....but my Dad is right up there with Eulus....it sufficed for me to just hug my Dad and listen to him talk for a second....he didn't say anything remarkable, just did how he always does.....but it was enough....that is what will get me through the rest of this school year....  I headed back over to the tent after that....and I was just in Euphoria....for once I wasn't concerned about anything at all....I just meandered from one point to the next....I didn't have one second of loneliness....I was in the right place at the right time for what seemed like only the third time in my life....(all three have happened this year....first was winning the national championship....and second was graduation weekend....I imagine the next time I feel that way will be when I get married or graduate from med school, whichever comes first....)  The time comes for me to head to the step show....my homie Randall looks out and finds tickets not just for me and Tiff, but also my lab partner, Jeralyn (did I misspell it?....and why is misspell such a hard word to spell?), and her best friend....things just pieced together for me like that....I go in and view the step show....it was like everything else this weekend....nothing special....yet the best ever....I can't explain it....I just sort of took it in and savored it....  Afterward I just headed away....I think this is when the agony started to set in (what is ecstacy without agony?)....as I headed into town with Tiffany I realized I didn't want to go to the party that night....I didn't want to hang with my boys....I wanted to see a female friend, but ole girl wasn't trying to hear it, she had to watch a movie with some friends or something....I took the hint....so I just wanted to head softly into the night....and I did....  I went to breakfast with my mother the next day....we had a good talk, as has become our custom....I try hard to be a good son because that is what every mother deserves, and I wasn't one for so long....I owe her a great debt....she has made great sacrifices for me and my sisters....I didn't see my little sister Nina and that tugs at my heart even as I type this....I have a hole in my trip and I don't think she understands that, but I do....one day she'll know how much I love her, yet how much of an effort it is to show her that love at times....  And I headed back to Nashville with Jeralyn....kind of symbolic of my new life....I have decided that she is my official connection between the old and new for various reasons I choose not to get into, but it was fitting that my weekend ended that way....  Anyway, it's back to the grind that is my Nashville life....and I'm out for now....
