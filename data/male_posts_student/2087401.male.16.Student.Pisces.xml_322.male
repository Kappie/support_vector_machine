Speaking of the comic, I say all you non-readers read a bit so we can play the Triangle and Robert Improvisational Puppet show! (or TRIPS)  It's like a role playing game, but made to be silly, instead of silliness being made a mere possibility.    Michael, what is IKEA?   Erin, from now on, always press the Post  Publish button.  It's got connected computers on it.  I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.
