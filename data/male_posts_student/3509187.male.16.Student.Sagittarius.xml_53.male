Well nothing much really happened until today anyways so its not like you've missed anything... I've got to say as sad and horrible funerals are, they are almost ok in a little way... I met family I never knew I had and it was pretty cool, I also got to talk to my three cousins who's dad lives in AZ and they all live in Flordia now (one lived in Costa Rica for a while witch is totally awesome).  They are pretty cool girls.  I also talk to their dad who I am probly going to visit this summer in mid to late August (sorry Victor, but AZ is better than Marching Band).  I'm going mostly for the vacation, but also maybe visiting a college or so.  I'm definately hoping to go to college out there, if not in AZ then knew by cause it is such an awesome State.  Today was the first day of finals and I'd have to say I didn't do as badly as I thought i would... then again that's just how I feel, last year I felt the same way and totally sucked it on most of them... We'll just have to see. Two to go. After school Chad, Chris, Paloma, and I piled into the Acsent and brought Paloma home, not cause she's a good friend or anything but because Chad is just that nice of a guy... but Paloma should not be expecting another ride anytime soon cause she was just a little horrible at her directions and we ended up in almost a complete circle. Then Chad, Chris, and I proceeded to Chirs' house to see who wanted to come play B-Ball at StoneBridge with us.  It ended up being Raz and Pu.  We played b-ball and then some beach volleyball, it was a hard game not cause we were very competetive, but mostly cause we were distacted by some umm... red beachballs by the pool.... umm right... and then we played some more b-ball. Chad had to go pick up his dad at work cause they carpooled this morning, when he got back we had managed to get ourselves (none StoneBridgers) into the pool with the help of Jesse Rodger's little brother who became out instant best friend... Chad brought us home and thats about where I am now...  Tomorrow I'm not sure what I'll be doing after the final 2 finals of this school year WHOOOO HOOOOO!!! I maybe going to Park Forest Pool con Senor Chedo. or maybe not.  So yeah Thank You to Angela D for taking my yearbook to school Friday and getting some people to sign it... I still need some people to sign namely: Marie, Mike, Stosh, Mary, Michael, Cliff, ?Jared?, Big T-Travis, James, Noah, Michelle, Katie Martin, Eric, Patrick, SexySexy Saxton (dan that is - I don't think he'll be there... so sad), and Angela Yen (crap she won't be there either).   If I forgot you I'm so sorry... just let me know and you can sign, I need all the friends I can get...  Hmm I should have made this list for Angela, she doesn't know all my friends, but you did get a lot of good people thank Miss Angie D...  So what are you doing after school tomorrow? How about for the summer?  Friday the movie "Dodge Ball" comes out, and it looks SOOOO Funny... we should see it sometime, maybe not friday but sometime, talk to me if you want to see it... Also heads up on: Napoleon Dynamite... Not sure when its coming here, I think in July. I Love the 90's, if its done as well as I Love the 80's, I Love the 70's, and I Love the 80"s Kicks Back, then it will be awesome... Starting July 12.  Well I maybe posting again later tonight... 'til then...  -Dan V
