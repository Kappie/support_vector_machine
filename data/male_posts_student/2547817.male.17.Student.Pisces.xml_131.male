It's all part of the form. Raeza and Mrs. C worked their magic today, The see things that the rest of us don't. I want to be able to see these things too. It comes with passion and skill. Raeza is now my benchmark in terms of theatrical ability. He's it because he's attainable. Set realistic goals is what we've been taught. By the way reader, Raeza is my ex drama president. I served him ice cream today. It was an honour. Oh man, a step more and I'll be kissing the ground upon which he walks. This is not good. Tim! Wake up.  I need God. I feel empty and sinful.  Jolyn is still the same. I think she's gone too. If she is, our relationship will be depth-less and professional. Hell, professional relationships are warmer than what I've got. And all this why? Because I told the truth about having a life. Yes reader, the world is not fare.  I just woke up after I dosed off halfway through a show. It was about a disturbed psychic. Weird and bloody. Mummy told me about the ending and I didn't feel so bad about dosing off.  I think I might be on to something when I ask you why we are polite. I will ponder and write when it is time.  I've been finishing in school pretty late recently. It's coz of moliere. I'm lethargic in class and can't carry on much longer. Oh, tomorrow is Cheryl's birthday. I chipped in about $20 for her present. I only wish I had the time to go buy it. Many datelines to meet. Am stressed. Want to go to sleep.  There's nothing precious about old people in the cemetery.
