It's like the movie just stops as soon as the action-packed climax ends, without any real resolution to anything - for another good example of this, see  Air Force One . Also, Tom Cruise was undoubtedly - at least in my humble opinion - the coolest villain since Keifer Sutherland in  Phone Booth . Jamie Foxx just sort of annoyed me. Best line - Tom Cruise: "I didn't kill him. The bullets and the fall killed him."  Besides this, I also saw  Garden State  yesterday, a dramady featuring Zach Braff (who also wrote and directed it), Peter Sarsgaard, and the lovely Natalie Portman. It had a good story - always poignant and at times riotously funny - as well as great performances from everyone in the cast, including all the canine members (you sort of have to see the movie to understand.) Best line - Zach Braff: "You collect Desert Storm trading cards?"
