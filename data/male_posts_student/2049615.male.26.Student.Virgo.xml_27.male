I'm pissed because right before this show, I realized I didn't have earplugs, and this show was going to be loud with a capital "metal".  I thought fate was smiling on me because as I was standing around shoving little bits of rolled-up paper in my ears, the assorted sound amateurs of the student radio station threw up their hands in exasperation at the recalcitrant PA.  I made the immediate decision to run to CVS.  Normally I don't place such a massive premium on avoiding four hours of tinnitus after a show but one look at the massed amplifiers of the various bands instilled the fear of death in me, and not without reason.  The sheer volume marshalled by each one of the night's bands could have killed an entire regiment of Civil War soldiers.  No guitar I witnessed was amplified by less than two amplifiers.  "This will be quick,"  I thought.  "In and out, no problems."  I had forgotten that a simple drive across Bloomington, despite the fact that the distance spanned is the length of four ashtrays laid end-to-end, takes around twenty minutes.  I returned, earplugs in hand, to find that  urlLink Coliseum  had come and gone.  And that in between they had kicked more ass than a centipede at an ass-kicking contest.  People are still talking about Coliseum, and considering the other bands that played, they had to have been impressive indeed.  Oh well.  Plus side, I managed to sell about eight pairs of surplus earplugs, which defrayed my cost a great deal.  The Coliseum, like Breather Resist, who played third, are from Louisville KY and consist partly of members of  urlLink Black Cross .  Next to play were  urlLink Angelville , who are sort of hometown heroes in Bloomington.  This was their first show back after a catastrophic van accident in which their lead singer's arm was severely injured.  It was also my first time ever seeing Angelville, and without intending any disrespect, I have to say that I don't understand the hype.  These guys put on a good, sincere, high-energy show (after which they still had the energy to support the two remaining bands by freaking out like crazy), but the two tonic notes of their performance are "not quite my thing" and "sounds exactly like a bunch of other stuff that's not quite my thing".  I think it's worth noting here that until I came to Indiana I had never met a Hatebreed fan.  Third were  urlLink Breather Resist , who were most decidedly my thing.  The name "Breather Resist" itself is taken from a hard-to-find Hoover track, but in concert, while the suggestion of Hoover is present, Breather Resist the band are a paralyzingly loud, dissonant rock force of their own design.  Sort of like Hoover, I guess, but faster and more distorted.  One thing I was glad that they were not was metal.  If anything, Breather Resist represent a throwback to an era of hardcore/emo in which metalcore had yet to devour everything in its goddamn path:  they are perhaps the last torchbearers of what Nathan from  urlLink Call Me Lightning  has called "fall-down" bands;  and fall down they do, right after delivering impassioned breathless lectures about social justice.  Last were Toronto, Ontario's The Cursed.  The curse of the Cursed is that of all other Canadians, with the exception perhaps of Godspeed! You Black Emperor and Kevin McDonald - they are too nice to do "evil" convincingly.  They whip up a good head of steam and spew forth a furious semimetal roar, but something about it (possibly road fatigue) kept it from sounding as frantic, as pissed, or as intimidating as a band this loud called "The Cursed" should.
