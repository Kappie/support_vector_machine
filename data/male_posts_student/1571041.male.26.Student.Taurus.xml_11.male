And, unlike last year, this year I was fortunate not to fall asleep @ the wheel and wreck.  Okay, let's try and recap this wow...  Friday, I had work, but planned on going to the wow anyways.  This has been something I've been looking forward to for awhile now.  Even though I did in fact  wreck last year,  I still look forward to attending this event every year.  One year I missed it because of school, and possibly next year I'll miss it too, but while I can, I'm still going to try and attend.  Anyways, I get off work, and start to pack up clothes and whatnot.  I finally manage to get things together and try to begin the ole journey ahead of me.  Yet, when I just start reversing into the street, I manage to see a couple homeys (  Duke  Lou  ).  As it happens, I finally cashed my check in that day, even though it was given the week prior.  So, I offer to take them along.  They look at each other, then to me, and ask, " you serious ?"  Like I've ever joked around about  taking a road trip ?  But, it just so happens that they aren't anywhere near ready to head out, so we head out 15 miles up north so they can pretty up and get packed.  It took a lot of time away from my getting out there, but in the end it was all worth it.  Now, we're rolling 3 deep to the spot.  One guy, Lou, makes some calls to see how things are shaping up.  It was massive from the sounds of it, as in over 500 dancers and a crowd in the thousands.  Sounds reasonable enough to me, and that's why I always look forward to this place @ this time.  There are natives scattered from one end of the dog track to the other end.  Then you have the natives just waiting for the nine too.  I happened to be driving a couple of these natives around, and needless to say, I think I also joined these ranks too.  But, we're teasing Lou about being the one who usually loses his ID as we pull up the the after wow spot, The Graille.  We get our smell good on and what 'good' clothes we had packed.  We stroll, or some might even say 'strut' to the entrance and right as we get to the doorway, I just happened to notice I didn't happen to have any Identification on me.  An old SIPI ID was in my wallet, a Safeway card, Replay Card, Best buy Card, GNC card, and a Barns  Noble Card.  All these things I'm carrying, even a grip of money, but alas, no ID.  Fortunately though, the homeys are on some all for one and one for all stuff and actually stay w/ me?  Surprising to me.  So, we just lounge around --  parking lot pimping it .  We joke around, waiting for   Trav   to come out, as he's the one who asked us to bring our presence there.  He said it was pretty weak though, so no worries, and not only that, but Lou and Duke managed to save  $  by not buying drinks and beers.  After Hours... not so hot.  Not very many attendants.  But, there was a small bit of drama involving me.  This guy comes around trying to be the life of the party and says something to which I blurt out, " Don't Worry About It ."  It wasn't meant to disrespect, but just a way of poking fun.  No luck though, as he's intoxicated and feeling like he can run things.  He looks @ me and assumes I'm an ex-con.  Starts rambling about, " Oh, he thinks he's the only one here who's done time.  He thinks he's the only convict here ."  To which he's taking off his shirt while saying these things.  This guy looks like he can definitely hold his own in any situation, but he's stepping up to me off an innocent comment?  I didn't have any aggression in me, even as he's trying to call me out.  Instead I laugh and look @ him, waiting for a move to be made instead of all talk.  He tries to chest up, and tries to  TELL  me to shake his hand.  I just told him, " I don't gotta do anything. "  Not yelling, not trying to make any sudden moves, not even trying to mean mug, but just talking in a normal tone.  He's pissed because he's not getting his just dues?  No one is bowing down to him?  So, he talks more and more, and I just let him know, " Do what you do.  I ain't hating ."  But, being that he's intoxicated all kinds, I have to repeat myself over and over.  It does finally end up that we do shake hands and things calm down.  He didn't know though, that Lou had already sized him up, and was just waiting for a move to be made so he can start dumping.  Not only that, I had a couple other folks just waiting too.  He had one other guy w/ him, and that wasn't going to help him @ all.  That was Friday night...  Saturday comes along and as it turns out, I get into the Studio w/ Trav to hop on the final track for their full length album that's yet to be titled.  I had this poem memorized from when I went to  Crow Agency  to try and put it down on a   Supaman   Beat.  The beat is so nice though, that  I still want exclusivity to it , but am not sure if that's even possible at the moment.  Anyways, a little background on that.  Me and a friend from SIPI end up going to Montana for spring break.  My reason for going is to see a couple friends, and also try and lay something down for   Supaman  .  I did, but the verse was weak and the freestyling wasn't anywhere near being considered good.  Just my own thoughts on my own works.  Yet, if   Supaman   wants to use that stuff, he has my complete permission to.  So, I let   Trav   hear that li'l verse I spit, and he loves it.  He knows it's nothing near what I'm capable of, but suggests we use it regardless.  I say alright, and a couple months later, it's finally put down fairly reasonable.  I like the way the vocals came together this time, as I was more prepared and had a li'l more experience in the studio, so the apprehension wasn't there.  The song is oh so nice though.  I just might have to post it up sometime after it's officially released by  The Lost Tribe .  Then, we go and start shopping.  Me, Money, and a means to spend it all @ once, and I"m bound to act an ass.  I buy cd's, dvd's, and this time -- Clothes.  Surprisingly, I also get some shoes that don't come from Payless.  Now, I end up spending most of my check @ the mall.  No regrets though, I know I'll keep what I have for a long period of time.  Then, we hit the wow.  Meet up w/ cousins, long lost friends, and shockingly,  The Rez Hogs .  They hustling like usual, and  The Lost Tribe  tries the same.  So I'm just wondering aimlessly getting caught up in conversations about what I'm doing these days, where I've been, and what's going on later.  I already know though, that I'm not hitting up the club.  That's alright by me though, because I don't drink and I'm not that much of a club person.  I bought a small portable dvd player and am alright just watching some movies outside in the parking lot.  Then it happens, we hit up after hours.  It wasn't that bad @ all, w/ 100's of people walking, talking, singing, and fighting.  It started out crazy.  I ran into a weird scenario from jump, but won't get into that.  Then a homegul was all inebriated hanging onto me, hugging me, and just trying to stand up.  I saw a guy I didn't like that's trying to get in good w/ an ex by downing my name.  Oh wells, I'm more than sure he's going to say something about that, but there's nothing to talk about.  She was drunk, I was sober, and she was trying to stay standing by holding on to me.  She was also hanging on Lou and others too.  One guy tried to take advantage of her, but didn't get anywhere.  @ least when I was around.  I didn't stick around too long.  She was breathing alcohol breath on me and quite frankly, it stunk.  But, there were some drummers singing 49 songs, and a homey was having his b-day there too.  It was fun, until things got stupid.  Wellpinit folks are weird.  They like jumping folks.  They take pride in jumping folks?  Well, as things start to turn out, they want to jump trav and his friends.  Those wellpinit folks didn't know I run w/ trav though?  I saw one small guy w/ a bat, and I was manuevering closer to him if he wanted to try and use it.  He didn't though, but there were guys and guls gripping bottles though.  Too many for me to try and stop, but I was @ least going to try something.  Didn't have to.  There was a head up fight, but homey got rushed and got the worse of the exchange.  Things don't really wind down though.  Trav ends up getting hit in the face w/ a bottle and the rig I'm driving nearly gets mobbed.  Not only that, but one of my cousin's cousin almost gets jumped by those wellpinit folks.  I step up in front of him though, along w/ more folks, and he's given a pass.  After that, it's all about,   do I go home and chance it again, or not  ?  I opt for not this time.  I call in to work and get home the next day.
