Had a really bad argument with Sam and James.  I feel like shit, they said a lot of nasty things.  The outcome of the argument was stubbon ol' me keeping my blog.  I had a chat with Becky and she suprised me.  At first it was as if she was on their side... but I saw her point of view.  The blog has been 'privitised' as it were and a forum is probably going to go up in its place.  They're much more fun anyways lol.
