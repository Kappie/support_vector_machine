It was filled with sinuous, muscular forms gyrating or posing to obscure trance, shitty techno, and the occasional overhauled pop/mambo - which of course got everyone wild, me included.   The point of gay pubs is to stare, to pack and press against bodies and be submerged within a surreal eddy of time and physicality, where contact among men flow as freely as alcohol.    Dan was with me throughout the night. He breathed into my ear: "I'm allowed to have fun too." He's attached, and had way too much to drink. I count him as one of my closer friends.   He stood by the taxi as I closed the door, my head reeling and buzzing. Enriched by booze, partings take on a certain pathos. Having always valued his company, it felt strange to also enjoy his affection. But such intoxication is timeless.  This morning, he texted: "Sorry about last night. Had too much to drink." I replied: "No prob. Hope you had fun!"   And so life goes on.
