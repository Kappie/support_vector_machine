Rain clouds seem to be a biannual event in Balmorhea.  Occasionally Balmorhea and the mountains get a good rain, and for a day Toyah Creek and the gullys that run into are again flowing with water, and for the week after, much of what once looked dead comes to life.  Well, that is what I've chosen to name my blog after.  I am starting a web log, mostly as a way of keeping in touch with friends, several of whom also have blogs.  By the way, my name is Philip Vickers and I am a 2002 graduate of Hillsdale College.  I am back home in Texas and loving it.    Like Toyah Creek, I am dry and often look dead.  However, some occasional rain of grace awakens me and I get a thought or two I'd like to share.  Most of what you'll read on this blog will represent the dead me.  On occasion, however, the river might flow.  We'll see.
