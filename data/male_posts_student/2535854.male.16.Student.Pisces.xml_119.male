Didn`t have PE as Pn Sharifah was teaching commerce...and I doubt we`ll have PE for the next few weeks as no one wants to go for the swimming test :p.Oddly the school has a swimming pool and yet many people (including me) don`t know how to swim!Actually a lot of people (also including myself) can swim but we just arent interesting in swimming in front of everyone else.heh.Just something we all don`t like doing!By the way,I can swim good enough so I don`t drow.heh.A dog paddle master.Haha.  Aside a boring day and once again laughing in Sejarah class while Mr.Tiru was going about with his 'hardcore students' thing and stuff...In Physics I started scolding the class`s orang jahiliyah yang datang dari Zaman batu terawal (?) or lets jsut Wei Hoong.He`s is so annoying!I had to calm myself down and cool down so I wouldnt lose it and start yelling at him.There was no teacher and the class was noisy so other classes were complaining and everyone was keeping quiet because the office threatened to make us stay back til 5pm...so I had to keep calm which thankfully I did...  Divyesh himself said Wei Hoong is likely the most annoying person he has ever met before.Constance almost said the same thing and she was laughing when she heard Div say what he did.She was doing a little bit of the jahiliyah fella`s work and then she felt lazy and decided he`s not worth her effort.Haha.Serves him right.  And I went home...then went out and grabbed a whopper over 1  can of coke and before that finishing a half opened pepsi in the fridge..and got that L'oreal Invisi gel..ugh..turns out the extra strength isnt on sale and the normal strength was the one on sale and four bucks less!Anyway screw it..ill just claim back from my dad :D :P ..hehe..  Then slept all the way!Hehe.til like 7 pm before mom woke me up and scolded me like shit...then ironed my uniforms..2 of them somemore..took forever...and not exactly that..had nasi kandar from Pelita as usuall.and slept at err dunno la 2am?haha..  Riz.
