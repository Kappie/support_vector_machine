So yeh, and my dad's calling me for some my cup of tea, so I'm having to rush. Seeing as I'm gunna have not as much time over the next, 5 (I think) weeks expect updates to be not as frequent but longer in general.. hopefully.   urlLink Oh yeh, and I added 2 more songs to my soundclick, so give them a listen if u have time.
