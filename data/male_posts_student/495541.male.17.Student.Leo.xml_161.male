I guess I'll just sleep in until noon and then watch TV all day.  Sounds like a plan.  This weekend was alright.  Hung out at Whits on Friday.  Then Saturday morning had the AAU tourney at Kennedy.  We lost all 4 games that day.  The bad part was that we had to play all our games in a row.  We didn't have enough guys to play two seprate teams so we combined them and played 4 games in a row.  I was pretty gased after the first two games.  Dang.  After that I just was lazy all day then went over to Whits and watched another movie.  I got my butt kicked in pool, but who cares!?  I'm going to be a pro golfer anyways.  (kidding)  Today we had another two games at Kennedy.  We lost those two as well.  That sucked.  That's alright though, I'm kind of just glad it's over and I can begin to relax and enjoy a bit of my spring break.  So yeah that was that.  Tomorrow I'm going to apply for a job at Best Buy.  I figure since I won't be playing sports I could at least work some and save up some money.  My first time applying for a job.  I think it's a pretty good bet becuase I know the manager real well and he told my parents there's an opening in the computer department.  So w00t.  I'll be bring in some cash money and getting major discounts.  Tight.  That's about all that's been happening.  I think I'm going to go to bed now.  Peace out.
