Yes I do leave the house, I play a lot of badminton (3-4 times a week), I go on dog walks every day, and I work.   2. Much to your obvious disappointment, no, I'm not gay. And I'd have thought that was pretty obvious from the whole fancyin' Nat thing? Or have you been living in a cave?  3. Yes, I do actually eat stuff other than ketchup. Incredible isn't it.   4. The only ppl who screamed were a load of the girls on the other side o' of the room. I just stood there saying "ooooh shit".  5. Yes, I do actually do things. I do have a life. Maybe if you tried being just a little more open-minded you'd notice that. But no, you'd be too busy writing pageloads of complete bullshit to try to annoy me with. Oooh, how impressive. Now why don't you just go do something more productive...like maybe throw yourself off a bridge?  Wooo. Work at Almondsbury GC is easy. Scan barcodes, swipe cards/take cash, wait ages for next customer. From 9-6. Every now 'n' then go stack some shelves or move craploads of compost around. Breaktimes, laugh at Bishop when he puts stuff in the microwave with ALL of the packaging still on it. As in, one of those small lasagne tray thingos, he put it in there while it still had the cardboard sleeve on. He's crazy. And whoopee-yayness, I get Â£8/hour when I work on bank holidays. ie Monday. Not bad, eh?
