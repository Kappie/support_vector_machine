Then we can paint it with sunflowers (yay) I admit this is a little more costly, but £50 is not that much. I may see some of you tonight, so I will talk more then. Also, my firend has a paintball gun, so we can be really  original  in our decorations. But, I don't know for sure that we can't have the VW, so we shall see.  Anyway, here is a logo I made in a moment of boredom:   Thanks to Olly for posting it, because Hello doesn't work for me.  Also look  urlLink  here  for a list of some festivals we could go to.   I am not obsessed, just bored.
