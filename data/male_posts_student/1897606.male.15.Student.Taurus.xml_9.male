But beneath this innocent-looking burger, there was a  dirty little secret . As I sank my teeth into the hunk of processed cow, a surge of sheer malaise overtook my body, and my throat broke into an uncontrollable fit of spasm and distress.   Onions.  I will never do business with the sunzabitches again.
