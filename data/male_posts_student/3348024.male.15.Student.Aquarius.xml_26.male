Too late, I realized that I could have shortened this phrase to two words. "It's not." Then having already made a fool of myself I noticed it could have been shortened to "It isn't." Man, I sure shot myself in the foot. Meanwhile, this hermaphodite I was talking to just kept talking despite the important discovery I made. Of course, I didn't tell him, but I think it was implied that something significant happened. It was something physical that happened. I suddenly felt like I was breathing cold air. Determined not to make a fool of myself any more than necessary I did not admit the fact that I had just turned a fan that was pointing at my face on. I passed this off as nothing. I started thinking. If I can shorten "it is not" to "it's not" and "It isn't" then why can't I just say "It'sn't". I came to the conclusion that had I said "It'sn't" Flatface would have found a way to virtually bitch slap me so I decided to keep the idea to myself.... Until now... (ok, this is when the mist should start forming at my feet and I should begin my sane laugh that would soon turn evil and obsessively obnoxious, and the Imperial March would begin and continue in an amazing crescendo until it was loud enough to break windows, but unfortunately I don't live in Hollywood and all isn't going to turn out well. I'll probably die of leukemia and my evil twin will take my idea and make millions of dollars, but what can you do when you don't live in Hollywood?) Ok, so I revealed it to you fooligans on the internet, but it's copyrighted now so eat it bitches.
