In the event that you become disabled (such that you are unable to use the services of Match.com)  before the end of your subscription period, you shall be entitled to a refund of that portion of any payment you had made for your subscription which is allocable to the period after your disability. (Emphasis supplied)  This was not buried in some fine print in a huge agreement; this was RIGHT OUT FRONT, and you had to read it before clicking "Okay." Does this strike anyone else as a  really bad way  to send people off into the merry world of online dating? "Good luck! Have fun! Wear your seatbelt! And even if you don't, don't worry... your family will be well taken care of."  Let's go through this disclaimer step-by-step and determine exactly how scary it is.  1)  "In the event that [I] die before the end of [my] subscription period..."   Let's get something straight: My subscription period is ONE MONTH. I didn't shell out for the 6 month plan or even for the 3 month plan. No, in my eternal optimism that I would find the love of my life in the next month, I figured one month was all that was needed. So, seeing as that I am only going to be on match.com for a month, I surely don't intend on dying before that time is out. And even if I do, how much consolation is that unused portion of 12 bucks going to be?  2)  "In the event that [I] become disabled (such that [I am] unable to use the services of Match.com)"   On the surface, simple. I break my hands in a freak baking accident? I get a refund. But what exactly counts as "becoming disabled" to the extent that I am "unable" to use match.com? Would mental disabilities count? What if I snap under the law school pressure and forget how to type? Does that count? How about if I get a huge assignment, in effect "disabling" me and causing me to be "unable to use the services"? Yeah. You see how it is.  In conclusion, match.com can go to hell.  PS - I got two dates through match this week alone! :-)
