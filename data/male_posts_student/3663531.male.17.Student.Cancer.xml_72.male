There are few better ways to spend a whole day then drive for three hours in a cramped, old, 28-seater bus filled with semi-evolved donkeys whos' cumulative IQ is equal to that of a dead badger (along with the smell) and holding the firm belief that throwing anything they can get their deranged little hands on at the various people sitting in front of them.  Once at our destination, we listened to much painful feedback from some large speakers, and then some strange girl singing in a pitch to envy a banshee our  lovely  national anthem, followed by a "motivational speaker" (note inverted commas) who spent half of the time talking about reading palms to set us up for some demented "Haha! You can't predict your life, but you can control it!" spiel, which by the way I realised he was going to do from the beginning, being the wonderfully insightful person I am. What? Anyway, we were then granted leave to go about and look at various miniature propaganda centres (Stickers saying "I love Virgin"?? C'mon, give us some credit... although  lots  of people were wearing them...) for us to peruse to clarify our career choice. There were a few problems with this, mind you. The first being that along with our band of semi-sentient inbreds, there were hosts of other rather intimidating students, walking around in huddled masses, all desperately trying to see how many trees-worth of brochures, pamphlets, and delightful booklets they could cram into several oversized, logo encrusted plastic bags in less than 180 minutes. The second, and possibly more unnerving problem was the spin-doctors and patsys, and bagmen representing these various institutions. Imagine the strange, ambiguoius-specied, hairy smelly and "colourful" characters we can see running stalls and rides at the local show. Now give them some sort of tertiary training, a fair amount of subtle brainwashing and a good clean scrub, and you are starting to imagine the creepy unnaturalism of these mutants.  I don't know about the average 17-year-old, but attempting to physically force upon me some piece of garbage or another with a creepy barney-the-dinosaur-smile with their eyes twitching in an unsetttling manner is hardly encouragement to "join the team" and seek to gain employment/enrolment in their psychotic industry/education institute. As fulfilling as the employment expo turned out to be, we were met with more excitment! That's right, a tour of the Telstra Dome! I try to refrain from profanity in writing, as it can draw from my message and/wit, so I'll say this.  It was crummy. We somehow managed to spend over an hour walking, then hobbling, and finally dragging ourselves forward with the one thought of finally get away, touring about what is essentially and indoor football oval. Sure, you can get drunk with more expensive booze, you can watch Foxtel on a moniter instead of the game, and you can attempt to spit on players that have displeased you, but this does not change the simple fact: Telstra Dome is a big oval with a roof. Pants-wetting exctitement. Thankfully (there is a God...!) the day had taken a toll on some of the less promising candidates for Human Citizenship, and thus their ability to make  hilarious  jokes and noises was somewhat taxing and they had to take rests that comprised of making slightly less noise. The moment I stepped off that bus, I looked at my watch and realised I had been awake for nearly  twelve hours  and I had accomplished nothing other than a more grumbling temperment, a  lower  esteem for everyone, and an upset stomach. So I thought,  "Dave, you gotta write  something "
