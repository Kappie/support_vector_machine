 As I mentioned before, I'd just met four people in less than a week that would all change my life. The first would be Crystal, she'smy Best Friend and I hope she always will be. I guess its possible that one daysheand I, will be more, I doubt it. She's always been there for me and well its great to know that you have at least one person in the world to count on. For a time she liked me as more than "just friends" but I kinda fixed that by dating one of her friends. That friend would be Amy. Amy's blonde, really hot, and she's really good at passing herself off as a "church girl". Something I go for, you know the good "girl type".Anyways, I asked her out at a friends party, I'd had a few drinks and wasn't drunk, but....... I guess I'd call it "tipsy".She said yes and we started dating. My birthday rolled around a few weeks later. By then we'd already kinda figuered each other out, or so i'd thought. Unfortunately, Amy had some friends that were also interested in me, for the life of me I still haven't figured out why. Amy and I had gotten into a stupid fight and broke up, just before our ROTC Christmas Party. I'd already fallen pretty hard for Amy, and seeing her around another guy about an hour later both hurt me and pissed me off. So I got over it, in a few hours. During that party her friend Markita and I ended up hooked up. another great girl. Unfortunately, I was still just a "boy" when it came to understanding women and love. A lot of fights, heartache and a few tears later,Markita and Ibroke up, what's worse was it was her birthday. I'm a jackass, I know. A week later, I ended hooking back up with Amy. Only this time it was different. I was still in "love" with Markita, and I was really falling for Amy the more I stayed around her. Well being that I was already dating AmyI stuck with her, hoping against hope that I would get over Markita. I really thought me and Amy would go far together. Not far as in sex, but as in the our lives. She seemed to be the perfect person for me. I got stupid. She invited me to her house, nobody home, to "spend some time together". I didn't expect to end up having sex with her so I didn't take a rubber. I didn't "perform" to well, and no i'm not making excuses for myself, mostly due to the fact that I was nervous and kinda scared. When we went back to school, Amy had totally changed, she was very stand-offish, and stuff. This continued for nearly a week when my parents pretty much screwed me over by moving me Albuquerque, N.M.. If you don't know where that is don't feel bad, we'll just say its a big city built in a hole surrounded by mountains. Amy broke up with me, before I left on the grounds that she'd been in long distance relationships before and they don't work. That hurt a lot and I actually considered going sui, just to make the pain go away. A week later, my friend calls and tells me Amy's talking mad shit about me and she's already found herslef a new boyfriend. Ever felt your heart drop? Mine dropped so far and hard, I think it busted a new mountain in China. A week after that, another one of Amy's friends, Lauren, called me up and well i ended up asking her out. I found out more about both Markita and Amy. Amy had lied to me the entire time we went out, and markita had cheated on me with six guys.I didn't know what to think I just knew that the greater part of me was over them for good. I found out that Amy said she'd only gone out with me so Markita wouldn't get her way and be with me. I found out loads and loads of things about them. After a weekLauren told me she loved me. No girl in my entire life has ever said it first, nor meant it as much as she did. A while later, bout a month I think, being the stupid ass that I am, I ended up listening to people in El Paso and broke up with her for supposed cheating. We ended up fixing our little problem and I fell even harder for this girl. Then I found myself looking back on my past relationships and realizing that after all this time, all the heartache, pain and few tears, I'd found a girl who made me happy. I felt complete. I found myself lackin certain aspects of "being a good Boyfriend". I'd never been in a relationship where I felt this much for anyone. I had just found real "love" and it was new. For once I really didn't know what to do.And again in my infinite wisdom, I opened my mouth and said some bad things to her afterLauren just came out and told me she'd be gone for a month. No explination. I didn't know how to react so I did what I promised her I wouldn't and jumped straight to conclusions. I felt instantly bad after I said what I said and turned to the only people I knew could help. My exgirlfriends. I explained as much as I could to them in hopes they could help me. Markita was the only one who wrote me back and tried to help. She told me whatI could tryto be a better boyfriend. I also found out from her I was the cause if a lot of her pain. She cuts herself to ease her emotional pain and for her it works. I feel really bad for causing someone the same pain I promised myself I'd never inflict on anyone. I know that kinda pain. Every girlfriend in my life has hurt me in some way or another except Markita and Lauren. I found out I was the one who'd hrt on Markita. Then yesterday, Lauren broke up with me. I've never felt pain like that. I'd rather take a harpoon to the chest than feel that pain again. Again the suicide thought have penetrated my thoughts. I found my punching bag does no good to releave my pain or anger and neither does Kita's way. Yea I tried it. It helped for a few seconds. Then I had to do it again. And again. So I got up went outside and went running. I was so lost in my thoughts I didn't notice it had started raining and there was a horrible pain in my lungs and sides. Ironic how it rains when I need it to. I love the rain. Especially if I feel bad. Then out of God'slimitless irony I found myself near a bridge, in the rain. I just kinda sat on the edge of that bridge and closed my eyes. I felt calm, and somewhat refreshed. My right wrist kinda stung from the rain on my cuts and my wristband was soaked, as were the rest of my clothes. On my left wrist, tightly wrapped around it was the bracelet Crystal gave me. Kinda weird. I felt as if she were there with me.  
   
 Obviously I'm still here, with another chapter in the "Meaning of Life." I'll move on, if not slowly. I left out lots of stuff in the above experience, mostly due to the fact that if I didn't it would take me about a week to write it all. Yet again, my veiw on life has changed. As has the value of my friends, and the nature in which I love, and place my trust. I must say Thanks to Crystal and Markita, both for helping me with the comlexities of life and for giving me yet another place to write and express my emotions and thoughts.
