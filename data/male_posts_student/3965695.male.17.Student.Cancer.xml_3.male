Our job was to level the ground inside of the 4 foot high cinder block walls, so that we could eventually pour concrete. This work was incredibly frustrating for me, because it entailed moving/relocating vast amounts of clay, and I only got to work for two or three hours total. Why? Because it is the wet season in Jamaica, and when we started at one o clock it would begin pouring at 230 or 3, and we were not allowed to work through rain. After work, we would shower and have free time until 530, then we would eat, have evening program, and have some time with our church groups before bed.     On tuesday, our evening program was pretty cool. Brad (the evening program guy) set up stations all around the school, most dealing with who we are, and self reflection. One station allowed us the time to just sit down and look out over the valley, where there were lights and fires from all the Jamaicans, as well as an awesome lightning storm out in the distance. This reminder of Gods power is something that will stay with me for a while. Also, one station had you create something that symbolized the week so far by making something out of duct tape. That was interesting.     Wednesday was our day off, and we got up for a three hour bus ride to Dunns river falls, where there was a beach and a set of waterfalls that we could climb. The waterfalls were really nice, the water was cold, and we did that twice. Some people from the group snorkeled or just relaxed at the beach. We then went a couple miles away to Ocho Rios, where there was a market and some restaurants. The marketplace was interesting- everything was bought by bartering- and the sellers were very entertaining. We met some serious rastafarians (Jamaicans who smoked a lot of pot and had not cut their hair for 20-30 years.)     We then got to the restaurant where our church was eating at 545, and we had to leave by 7. Here, we waited and waited, and our appetizers arrived at about 7, and we didnt leave until 830. we got back to Catadupa at 1130 and went to sleep. On thursday we switched workplaces, and headed down to the market at Catadupa to rebuild part of it. This worksite I liked much better because we interacted with Jamaicans much more. That morning one guy was cooking for us, and he was making codfish and dumplings, with some breadfruit. All morning we were smelling this stuff cook and it smelled great. We learned a lot about how to make that particular dish, and he showed Jesse Raines and me how to make the dumplings- Jesse could do it but I couldnt. We also befriended a guy named Twinney, who I'll tell you about later. It began raining during lunch, so we didnt get to work in the after noon.         The community threw a party for us that night, with some people selling us things and people cooking jerk chicken and power water (goats head soup). Both dishes were delicious. A couple of us bought shirts and such, and I bought a turtle and two pipes ( and I was asked if I wanted anything to put in the pipes, and he wasnt talking tobacco. I declined). Then, with some late 90s pop songs blasting and the food cooking, Jesse, Adam, and I went over to Twinney and started talking about the marketplace. Then we asked him a couple of questions, and then we started talking about marijuana. He was really stoned and excited to talk about his favorite subject. It turns out that most Jamaicans only smoke heavily when they are working (Twinney said he had ten that morning, these were fresh fatties, about a centimeter and a half diameter). He also listed off the uses- boil it and eat it like cabbage, make tea, squirt it in your eye to make it better, make wine, and on and on. We didnt really have to ask much, he loved talking. He then said he would bring us a plant to show us on Friday. We didnt really think he would, but the next morning he pulled Adam and I aside and took us into this little meat shop (just a little shack, not exactly clean) and reached behind a fusebox and pulled it out, and handed it to Adam. That was pretty funny. We worked for the rest of the morning on painting the skeleton of the roof, and then we mixed some mortar. To do that, you have to only use the smallest particles of the sand, so we used the seive that gold miners use, shaking it furiously to get the little stuff onto the ground. It was intensely hard work.     By the end of the day, the pittsburg group had already left (they got there a day early) and it hit us that we were leaving already the next morning. I really didnt want to come home, and I still wish I was in Jamaica. Its hard to descirbe the difference in cultures. In Jamaica everyone says hello to everyone, everybody wants to make sure everybodys doing ok, and they sincerly mean it.Its very laid back, things are frequently late, and its all good. "no worries, mon" they'd say. Here its completely different, and I can;t help feeling caught up in the rush of America. We drive our SUVs because we feel a need for power, not because we go offroading. In jamaica they drive little toyota sedans on roads with potholes the size of bathtubs, and they enjoy it because they can stop and talk to people while crossing them. Here we live in montrously huge houses- look at windom hills, where four person families have houses in which 30 people could live comfortably. Jamaican houses have a kitchen, with a bedroom and common area, with 8 person families. The houses are the size of typical windom hills living room. The funny thing is, these people who live in filth, without electricity and little education, are ten times happier than your average York Suburban High School student. There is something to be said for the power of love, something freely given in Jamaica. We complain about something not going just right  every day.  And I am not different. We have incredible comfort, financial stability, and resources, yet we do nothing of value with them.     If you didnt know already, I am supposed to have surgery soon-  urlLink pilonidal cyst - and it was scheduled for tomorow, but has been changed to friday. This cyst thing has been incredibly annoying and sometimes painful, but mostly annoying. It will be a blessing to get rid of it, but i wont be able to drive, sit for long periods of time, run around, play sports, or do much of anything for a couple of weeks. So, i would appreciate some prayers for that. The good thing is that I now get a couple more days of activity, but the recooperation will be that much longer. I hope that no one else that I know gets it, cause it has made my life kind of difficult.
