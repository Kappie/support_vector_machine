My GOD! there was this crzy little **** that kept yelling at me, so I kicked him alot. It was fun. Then I watched Comedy Inc. FUNNY!!! Then I went to sleep. Today, we had sport. it was alright. Then Textiles. I got my Machine licence, and I found about 50 pins for Ms Sciacca, but that was it. So now I am posting and that is it. The Amazing MonkeyMan Ben Smith
