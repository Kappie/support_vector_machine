Butterflies and Nervous Feelings Swirling lyrics Reminding me of Everything Im missing  Dont think Id mind Too much if it was You I could be kissing  How lovely youll always Seem to me when Your eyes pour into mine  Always I feel As if Ill never Escape this twirling vine Can't I say what I feel? You wont let me inside why cant these feelings for you subside in my mind. these butterflies and nervous feelings have a hold on me without talking to you i'll probably never be free. tell what you feel inside i just want to know if there will be a time time that is left is rapidly diminishing for the light i give you might not be there again.
