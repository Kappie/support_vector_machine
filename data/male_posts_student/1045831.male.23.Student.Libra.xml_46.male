Me, Toms and Pike went to the Parade at 11:30 am..  Toms immediately got hammered.  we stayed there for a while then headed to westport for a few more hours..  Seeing people we knew and getting drinks bought for us all along the way..  Then out to JoCo for the remainder of the nigh..  PJ's, Paddy's and McBrides..  a long crazy drunken night with too many stories to list them all here..  As for the rest of the week it was filled with lots of work..  I have grown to hate work but that is OK cuz I have tons of cash saved and no longer have anything expensive to waste it on except my trip to New HAven...  Thank the lord for the American system of Law and Insurance Co.'s...  well Other than that I have a bunch of school work to get to so I will be busy for a while..  Sorry I couldn't be more detailed with the excitement that is my life but I am tired and have been super busy..  BUt I'm going to end with a quote from the smartest man I know..  me..  "Wake up every morning with a smile in your heart, a twinkle in your eye and a blonde in your bed and everything will be ok..."  School calls..  peace kids..
