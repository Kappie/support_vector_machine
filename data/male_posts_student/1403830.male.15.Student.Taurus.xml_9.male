I already went out of town, and that wasn't that great.  I came back.  I still feel alienated from the group sometimes.  But whatever.  I don't want to go back to lakeside at all.  I don't want to play football.  I had a goal for this summer  And that was to meet someone who I really cared about  And so far that hasn't happened  And trust me  Its not from lack of trying  New topic  I crossed the line into metrosexualism yesterday  I went shopping at express  And I actually bought something  Gay guys are funny  Kinda creepy and have wierd voices, but funny.  That was a big generalization.  Sue me.
