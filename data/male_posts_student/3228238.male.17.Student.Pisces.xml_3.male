It was a place where I could leave my world behind, and live in God's world, even if only for 3 days.  I began with wondering what I would get out of it.  And I discovered, that you never really know until you open your heart and the Lord squeezes His way into it.  And once He does, you feel like your heart is an ocean, filled with His very PRESENCE and LOVE.  The person I was before meeting Christ was different from the person I became after meeting Christ.  It seems that each time I meet Him, He becomes more real and alive to me.  Stay tuned as I will continue to write more on my experiences with God during this weekend in Heaven.
