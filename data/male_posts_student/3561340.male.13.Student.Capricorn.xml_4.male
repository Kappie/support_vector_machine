Everyone else got to go outside, but me and Ryan had to sit in Dr Yates's room where it was about 85 degrees and she actually made us sit up and face the front of the room. That was the worst detention I have ever had. An hour sitting up while all my friends are outside. But Mrs Riley said we could go get some of the food and that was pretty good. But it still sucked and it was all because I threw a fucking bagel! And Robbie the faggot didnt get in any trouble. He was the one who attacked me. Fuck this school. Fuck Stubey. Fuck Mrs ALlyn. Fuck Heather. Fuck those other people who said I hit Robbie. And most of all, Fuck Robbie. Fuck it, Im done
