Firstly, I removed the earthquake generator thing, after complaints from Megatrobe and Dickybod.  Well, I stayed in the house all day again (what fun!), and have finished the first of the physics tests I had to do, and done about half of the second one. Only half, because it is very very very difficult. Physics extension. The horror! If I'm very lucky, Megatrobe or Nonnesuch will tell me the answers before Wednesday, if they managed to do any better than I did. Looks like I need to revise physics more. Or start. Yes, that would be a good idea. And geography.  Had a good read of www.thingsmygirlfriendandihavearguedabout.com (Haven't quite worked out how to put links here yet). I'll put a link on the side of this page, if you don't want to copy and paste this one. I'm probably more than 2/3 through it now (it's very long), and it's very interesting. I reccomend you to have a  read.  Not much more to say right now, I'll write a longer post when something interesting happens.   Playing:  Nothing again.  Listening To:  Neun und Neunzig Luft Ballons, by Nena. Despite being German, it's very good.  Watching:  Father Ted and Black Books last night. Friends, Have I got news for you, Distraction tonight  Annoyed With:  Those physics tests  Confused About:  Q. 4 - Resonance and momentums  Mood: Fine
