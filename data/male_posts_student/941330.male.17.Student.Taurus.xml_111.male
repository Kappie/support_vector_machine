HE'S OVER THERE!" sophie came back with kevin and i said is she flipping you off so alex yelled "you're not flipping me off are you!!" alex and amanda played horse, and amanda was first to ho, hor, hors, and horse. then kevin called to get my bike, but he couldn't unlock the lock, so alex is like "you can bring the bike rack with you." so kevin came, we all talked, and kevin and amanda left so me and alex walked home. we watched the freshman football game, and alex is like, maan i wanna play. but the freshmen team sux, they never pass, they can't run, they can't juke, they can't punt. then we went home. and i got a badminton racket, it's a crappy 90 g wilson titanium POWER racket, but wahtever, my dad keeps on saying "the racket's cheap but it's still probably too good for you." psht. that's a good way to motivate your kids.
