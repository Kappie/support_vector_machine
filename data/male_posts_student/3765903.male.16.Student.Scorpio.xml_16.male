Night after night I sit here, staring at this damn computer screen just waiting for inspiration to hit me - similar to how I, day after day, sit at my easel and wait for a masterpiece to miraculously appear on the sheet in front of me. Problem is that inspiration never seems to hit, and that masterpiece never gets created. It's driving me insane! For at least 4 days I have been trying to write my 9th chapter of closeted secrets - and I have done about a page worth - but that is it. No more. But I am determined to get it done by tomorrow night - bloody determined!  *sigh* why can't I have been created with a scientific type mind? Like Marin! Then the stuff i come out with would probably be of some use to somene... as it stands my brain is just full of angsty and dark drawl... Can't I at least once come up with a story where people are happy? hard to believe that when I came up with the basis for 'dead popular' I originally intended for it to be a happy fic... but then look what happened! She killed herself! A happy fic that does not make!!!!  Oh well... I'm gonna stop moaning now - I'll never get me anywhere... so on to more positive things - woo! Martin! I got to see him today! Well - ok, so we went bowling with my mom and bro... it was scary.... Specially when this little kid randomly asked me whether I had a boyfriend... i was so frightened! Oh well... I can't help having hoards of admirers (I wish...)
