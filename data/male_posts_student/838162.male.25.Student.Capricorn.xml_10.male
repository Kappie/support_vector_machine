Communication is DE most important aspect of humanity (I dare say this because basically Prayer is a form of communication). Communication can build and save friendships, relationships and even lives. But when something so powerful is so freely available, it can be even more easily abused, especially in human hands. While I may seem to firmly support technology (a fact that I believe puts me at odds with some of my fellow Christians), those in the Know understand that I actually support Protecting and Educating about technology. There is a very big difference. I shall speak of this at another time/date.
