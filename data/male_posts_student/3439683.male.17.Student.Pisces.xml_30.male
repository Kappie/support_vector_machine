Gotta go to school today....yeah, in July, I know. Have to take this Spanish test so that I can take the college spanish class this coming school year. Then I gotta get some CD-R's, and buy this book, "Cry, the Beloved Country"....never heard of it, but English teachers have a way of making us read the most boring books....with a couple exceptions, being, "Born Again" by Chuck Colson, and we didn't get to read this last one, it was the freshmen that had to read it, "This Present Darkness"...I just read that, AWESOME book. *sigh* gotta get dressed, eat lunch (de ja vu?), call John about being our drummer, call that woman about getting recorded, call Zack and Paige, see if they want to join in the fun on saturday....and pick up that program from Alex.....
