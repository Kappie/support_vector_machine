I think the reason I got a good grade is because my teacher didn't feel like grading rewrites.  Seriously.  Everybody in the class seemed to get an A or a B on the paper.  Oh well, I'm not going to complain.  An A is an A.  Even if I gave a C effort on it, I'll take the A.  Let's see, what else...Little Girl is still wildly missed.  It's the weird times where I miss her, like when I'm grabbing a cucumber out of the refridgerator, I almost expect her to come limping by to say hello.  It's weird, how I notice the little things.  My parents are talking of getting another pet, which is an about face to how they have felt over the years.  It used to be that whenever Little Girl left us, we'd have no more pets, but I guess they realise how much they miss having a pet in the house.  They are worried, though, that if we get another cat, it will run out into the street.  See, Big Guy (our old cat) and Little Girl used to run out into the street a lot.  Big Guy got hit by a car and unfortunately died.  Little Girl got hit by a car, hid in the woods for two or three weeks, then came back one day limping like crazy with a hunk of skin missing from her leg.  While she eventually nursed herself back to health (because she was a tough cat), she never played in the street again.  My parents are afraid that if we do get another pet, the only way it will learn not to play in the street is if it gets hurt, and they don't want that to happen.  So we'll see.  On the social front, nothing new to talk about.  I still don't really hear from Grim too often anymore.  I'm beginning to think I'm probably not going to see him too much anymore.  This Friday is my birthday, and I'm going to spend it hanging with my friend Travis and maybe my friend Joe.  Hopefully not too many alcoholic drinks will be consumed.  :)  Then in just over two weeks,  my graduation party will be the end of summer.  It's weird.  Normally, the end of summer has meant the beginning of school.  This year, the end of summer will be the end of school.  And I mean, the end.  I'm graduating.  It's weird, though I am considering grad school.  We shall see.  And that does it for this update.  Please tune in to www.wmcx.com on Thursday from 12-3 PM and Sunday from 3-6 PM for my radio show, and other than that, take care, whomever you are.  Even if Tanya is still the only person reading this.  :)
