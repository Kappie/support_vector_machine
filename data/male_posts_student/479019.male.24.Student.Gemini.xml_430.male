I went to VizCult and secured an apartment here at Hayes for next year. Tomorrow I have 697, sitting in on history, and maybe going to the talk on the Russian Monastery done by CEMERS. I kind of wanna go out drinking again tomorrow night also. We'll see.  Fries in the oven... and gonna have my last bottle of Newcastle. Nice, but being productive would be nicer.  ***
