Got an A for my speech in English, I was dead set on an A* so that was a bit of a let down, but nevertheless it was a good result.  Marcus and Sam seem to be on the rocks again, doubtless they'll be fine by tomorrow or something. It always depresses me when they start not working. Whereas Suz is unquestionably dancing around my room saying that they're falling apart. God bless her.  I'm starting to realise that it wasn't exactly that I fancy Caroline that I want(ed) to ask her out. I just have a massive urge to be with someone, you know, hold them to you every time you see them. I don't like being single >_  Love, Jon Roskilly
