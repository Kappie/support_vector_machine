Told him to meet me at 12. He never can. He was (shock!) asleep. Rung him. He said to meet at 1:30 instead. Never arrived. Had fallen asleep again. I went to his house instead, and he was in the shower. I waited in his bedroom, and he came in wearing only a pair of boxers. Wooo. Semi-nudity. He got dressed, and sprayed half a can of lynx deodorant on himself. I almost died. We left his house some time around 3, and headed into town. We walked for a few minutes, made it to Upham road, and a thunderstorm began. How fun. So we waited under a bus stop until the bus arrived, and went into town. And that was the highlight of last week.  By bye for now. Jams
