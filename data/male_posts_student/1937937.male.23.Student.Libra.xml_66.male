She is currently reliving her highschool experience by reading  urlLink The Perks of Being a Wallflower  (TPBW).  TPBW is actually a surprisingly good book.  She read some of it aloud to me last night.  There was some depth, and some extraordinary insite.  I'm going to go shopping for Carissa's birthday gifts today.  I've got many ideas, but I haven't had time to put any of them into action.  I definitely want to treat her like a princess tomorrow.  Girls really want to be treated like princesses.   urlLink Friendster  continues to amaze me.
