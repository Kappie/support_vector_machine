Thats what u get for installing illegally downloaded stuff thats supposed to cost 500 dollars. i hate french so much. i mean, its just so pointless. yah, like im going to go around in Sudbury talking to everybody in french... i hate tech ed too. its boring pointless and all we do is make drawings. but we had a sub at least  marc: you know, you could have said no! (marc referring to a kid who got asked out by a girl) ******:welll... sub: heres some advice, never say no to a girl marc: well, what if its a fat ugly sped girl who bitches all the time? sub: NEVER SAY NO!  yup. sub giving out dating advice. at lunch patrick was treating his red frozen juice pop that had melted like a weapon and threw it at people. then, after he had his fun, he opened it up, drank a little and started to go to the bathroom. alex grabbed him before he walked into the door squeezed the little plastic tubing. most of the red stuff landed on his patch like on his crotch. it looked like he attempted to screw a woodchipper. so, whenever u see gogan, call him woodchipper or pms.
