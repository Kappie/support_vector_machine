(no worries about the classes the professor is way cool and said it was cool and even gave me some extra working time) I can’t imagine anyone better to spend it with but it’s going to be bitter sweet. I will have her to myself for the whole day but when it’s over I am going to have to watch her drive off and six days later she is going to ask Dan, on his birthday, if they can be together. I so wish that every time that I get to see her that everything would just stand still. That I could just hold her and never let her go. Like she said to me the other day, “I wish I could just hold you for like 10 minutes.” Personally I think that 10 minutes won’t be enough (LOL). She has such an effect on me, so much so that every time I see her I start shaking and I can’t stop it. Each time I want to tell her that she is making the wrong choice, to plead with her to reconsider. I just sit there quietly; inside I’m screaming. I know she knows. I know that she can see it in the way I look at her. I think that the only thing that keeps me going is this romantic idea I have in my head that she one day will come around. Well it’s more in my gut then anything. I just know. It’s like your favorite movie where you know that the ending is going to turn out in favor of the protagonist but you still sit through miles of film wondering if they are going to defy all odds and make it. To the outsider that reads this, don’t judge her. She too is going though a lot. It’s been the topic of many of hers and my conversations. I know that she is hurting as much as I do. I look in her eyes and see that she is so torn. It hurts me to see her like that. She tries to act like she isn’t about to cry but you can see it clear as day. I guess that is why I don’t sit there and plead with her to choose me. I don’t want to cause more hurt for her. She is already headed in one direction anyway. I just hope that the saying is true. You have to set free the things that you love the most.
