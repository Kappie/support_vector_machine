I went to visit him today and boy, he was so full of energy and optimism.  THe first thing he said to me was, " Want to play game?" and he lifted up his vital stats controller to me. That was damn funny. He's a funny guy.. and good guy. Good ppl dun die that easily. He wont be in hospital for long i hope. He better get well soon, or else my father got no 'car'... cannot play mahjong.  Next is the second disaster. The departure of  Michael Owen, me.   Sad thing to happen. He should have waited for me. just 7 more years and i can take over the reigns and reign over the soccer world. He's off to Real Madrid, and now my favourite club is slowly changing.. once Diouf and Hyypia leave, I guess i will have 2 favourite clubs.    My jersey number is likely to change too. No more 24(Agu Casmir) for me. My new favourite would be watever Owen takes. Hopefully its 24, its not taken yet in Madrid.   I am Owen.Owen is me. WE ARE ONE
