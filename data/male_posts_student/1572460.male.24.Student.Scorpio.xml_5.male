My purpose for creating this blog is not necessarily to write day in and day out or perhaps not even week in and week out, as most people like to do. But for the time being my short term goal is to put up what I would like to call as "My Diabetes Chronicles".  It has been a little less than 6 months since I was diagnosed with IDDM (Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus), commonly known as Type-I Diabetes. Before I was diagnosed with diabetes, I was never a serious writer, but I have always had a habit of writing notes and maintaining a scratch pad (my version of a "diary"), although my frequent laziness to jot down my thoughts on paper did not allow me to get into any kind of routine writing. However, the last 6 months have changed this. Almost every single day as a diabetic has been pretty much unforgettable, and I have made it a point to record every minute detail that I have experienced and been through as a diabetes patient. At the risk of sounding overly emotional, my chronicles have helped me put some things into perspective and this has changed my life for the better. Through my chronicles, I hope to describe my experiences as a diabetic - both good and bad, some painful and agonizing moments, but which eventually led to a pretty successful achievement, and an immense feeling of self satisfaction, that surpassed every other feeling. My story would perhaps not be a whole lot different from fellow young adults who have also been recently diagnosed with diabetes. But personally, as silly as it may sound, diabetes has been a blessing in disguise for me. And nevertheless, there have been a lot of positive outcomes.  I guess, that is enough writing for this introductory blog. Keep checking this space, for my chronicle dispatches/archives.
