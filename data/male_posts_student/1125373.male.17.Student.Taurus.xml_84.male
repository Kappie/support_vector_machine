Crazy Asian.  Freshman camp started this week, and the kids are pretty cool.  Before that though, we did trumpet initiation which consists of waking them up at 3 in the morning and doing other stuff. Well, we were short drivers so i called an upperclassman in to help. We decided to do the job in a caravan, so we wouldnt get lost. However, we made the mistake of driving down parkway at 3:45 in the morning after picking up adam w. Well lets just say a coppell cop noticed and started following me cause i was on the end. However, i noticed this and i completely stopped at a stop sign and he got fed up with me and went around. But then he noticed the upperclassmen and got him....for basically changing lanes twice without signaling and speeding slightly. BUT! The cop was nice enough to let him off and only get mad at him for not having his insurance card. Oh did i mention? The kid, adam w, was in the backseat blindfolded. Thank goodness the kid is smart enough to remove the blindfold before the cop came up.
