I mean, I actually beleive that dreams mean things. I don't know why this has got stuck in my head, I havn't actually had a dream lately, I was just wondering. Hm...now that I think about it, the most recent dream I have had was about two weeks ago. I dreamed that I was in school without a shirt on, and was asking people if I could borrow one. This is the closest thing I have ever had to what people think is a common dream of being naked in school. The weirdest part about the dream was that I was walking around with Miranda Buchman, and she offered me a cigarette, andI smoked it (and later one more) and stated that I shouldn't smoke them or else I would get addicted. I can explain the part about the cigarette a little because of reading about the whole inner person thing at this blog,  urlLink www.andr246.blogspot.com  . Also, during the dream I was scared to death that a teacher or someone would catch me without a shirt on (even though I was looking for one) and give me detention or something. If you have any interpretations, or perhaps explain what the heck I could have eaten to get a dream like that, I would appreciate you telling me.  For the last three days, I was at soccer camp in Grove City. That was pretty great. Andy Nosko and I even got a girl's email...that's a story! Also, during the camp, I went from 15 or 16 percent body fat to 13 percent. Wow. That is kind of sick, expecially since I didn't lose any pounds. That is all muscle buildup. Awesome. Now, Jared, try and keep it up. Anyway, it's like, 11:27 and I am feeling tired. Maybe I should go to bed. Nah...  I was reading on the internet, look up the word trillion in google and I am sure you'll find it, about a formula used to figure out what stocks are good, which are bad, what'll help, etc. The formula was likened to figuring out the double helix in DNA (a significant find). I was kind of curious, if such complicated things like the stock market be figured out with a simple formula, what other things in life can? I would like to think of myself as a logical person. One plus one always equals two for me. Despite that I hate and suck at math, I enjoy logic. Now, in life there is a lot of variables, and not that many, or perhaps none at all, stable areas. Many parts of people's thinking are documented by use of surveys and science. Such things as hormones, enviroment, genes, etc all play a role in what people act like, do, and say. Could all of this be broken down into a simple formula? Could we figure out what people are going to do, or about what they are thinking? We do have some pretty accurate lie detector testing equipment nowdays. I was just wondering if we could become so sophisticated that we could unlock all areas of our natural mind using something as simple as a formula. If you are a heavy thinker, stick that into your brain and ponder for a long time. So many contradictions will come up. If anything, thinking thoughts such as these will keep you busy.  And speaking of busy, I have been. Today I welded in my roll bar, what a task that was. Beautiful welds though, gosh. I know it is probably hard for someone to understand how beautiful something can be that you create your self. This rollbar, and the awesome welds...it's like poetry. It flows. I can almost not bear grinding them down.   Sitting in my ignorance. Curious. Wondering what's next. Curious. Figuring out the future. Curious. Asking the right questions. At all the wrong times. Figures. Looking one way. Figures. Running the other. Figures. What should I do? What can I do? What will I do?
