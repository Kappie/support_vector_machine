As I posted to old BD board, my son did well with Death Gargoyle MS against Wolborg MSs at last tournament. Here are cause of result.   1. My son is 6 years old. Youngest age to enter tournaments.  2. But he went to 2nd, 3rd stage quickly.  3. Opponent player guessed that my son must have well tuned Bearing Core based endurance type combo.  4. At this point, he showed his G-winder prepared grip, right spin.  5. To beat my son, same spin direction seemed to be best. Every opponent players selected right spin (most players were Wolborg MS).  6. Result. My son won.   Wolborg MS vs Death Gargoyle MS  A: right vs right  B: right vs left  C: left vs right  D: left vs left  For best result, my son had to select pattern "A". To do so, my son had to let his opponent select right spin. This strategy part decided result of my son's tournament matches.  Strategy, Combo building (and tuning), Launch technique. These three skills decide player's skill.   Please treat this situation as yours. What strategy will you use to let your opponent select right spin for his Wolborg MS ? Without this strategy, your good launching skill of Death Gargoyle MS is almost useless."  wow i never expected beyblade to get so much harder but its all worth it XD
