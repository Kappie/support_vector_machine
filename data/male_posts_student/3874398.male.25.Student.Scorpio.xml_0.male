I weary of my Doom and Gloom, fire and brimstone, Jonathan Edwards impression, but we need a dominate starter.   Could the old adage be wrong? "Good pitching beats good hitting." Can you have good enough hitting to overwhelm the best pitching available? If the Card's stay as is, we will see a whether it holds true.  -CJ
