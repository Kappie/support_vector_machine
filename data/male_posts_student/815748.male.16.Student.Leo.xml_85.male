The food wasn't great, but the conversation was really entertaining.  We talked mostly about politics and synagogue society.  Very cool, I definitely made the right decision in going.  I was going to continue this coolness by watching back-to-back episodes of Law  Order: Criminal Intent, but then I started talking to Hiro on AIM and then on the phone about a much more pertinent and important issue: Mock Trials.  We had to revise it a little bit based on PJ's advice.  We were going to go over it more in depth, but Hiro had to finish his closing.  He asked, "How late are you staying up?"  I said "Until whenever."  Little did I know that would determine my next five hours.  To pass the time waiting for him to finish, I watched ultralate, syndicated episodes of The West Wing and ER, the former of which was really good.  Then, I worked on my direct, addressing objections top to bottom.  While talking to Hiro, he kept offering to do it at the meeting the next day so I wouldn't have to stay up so late, but I wanted to finalize the direct once and for all.  Plus, I kind of like being awake when I shouldn't be for a glorious cause.  As I was saying to Kevin online, who was up to write some astonishingly boring English essay, I feel like I'm in an airport.  Whenever I travel, I have to wake up earlier than normal.  When I go to the airport, there's always a lot of things going on around me, and I'm somewhat interested in them, but I'm still kind of out of it.  If all goes well, pretty soon Hiro will finish his closing, he'll hear my finalized Burke, we'll work on memorization etc. of Burke and Faulkner.  As you can see by the timestamp, it's almost four in the morning.  At least two good things have or will have come out of this:  1. My direct and my performance thereof are or will be airtight.  2. I now have a great new way to start anecdotes: "As I was saying to Hiro in bed the other night..."
