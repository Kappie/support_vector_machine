I've got tickets to one per day and I'm not even using that. To think, I'm missing such a thing because I'm lazy.  Well, I'm back from camp. Things have changed and moved on since I've left, for bad or good. They got rid of my favorite Slurpee flavor, Mountain Dew, and replaced it with "Pepsi" which looks and tastes like Coke. My family seems to have used my sleeping quarters and private sanctuary as a dumping grounds of sorts. My mother promises to help clean up tomorrow which is alright.  I forgot to mention: Emily wasn't the only religious discussee I had the pleasure of during camp. Nisanth (sp) and several other persons of varying faiths spoke with me as well. I received a compliment for my valient defense of my faith: I was the only guy Dan (another Dan, if you can believe it) knew who could answer his questions quick off the tongue. I felt like Paul, debating with the Jews in their synagogues over the Messiahhood of Jesus.  Also, on a more gory note, there were gamers in that camp. I guess one should expect it, as the standard debater is white, male, and prone to fits of mass geekdom. I was a decent player and a welcome addition to the team. We downloaded an Unreal Tournament 2004 demo and played Onslaught until the computer lab closed.
