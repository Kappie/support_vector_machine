They drank up the wine  And they got to talking  They now had more important things to say  And when the car broke down They started walking  Where were they going without ever knowing the way?    CHORUS:    Anyone could see The road that they walk on is paved in gold  And It's always summer, they'll never get cold  They'll Never get hungry  They'll never get old and gray  You can see their shadows Wandering off somewhere  They won't make it home  But they really don't care  They wanted the highway  They're happier there today , today    The children woke up  And they couldn't find 'em  They Left before the sun came up that day  They just drove off  And left it all behind 'em  But Where were they going Without ever knowing the way?    Anyone could see The road that they walk on is paved in gold  And It's always summer, they'll never get cold  They'll Never get hungry  They'll never get old and gray  You can see their shadows Wandering off somewhere  They Won't make it home  But they really don't care  They wanted the highway  They're happy there today , today (repeat)                     Ok. So thats one of my most favorite songs, and just today I realized the correlation between the song, and summer, and drum corps. Aside from the lines about drinking wine and such...  I've been thinking alot...and it seems a heck of a lot harder to get into drum corps this season, than it was last year. I guess that song reminds me more of last season, when I was a rookie, thrown into all of this, blindly marching along, giddy to please the crowds.   Now I know what it takes, and it scares me a bit. Am I able to to that again? Looking at our schedule of 9-9s, or 9-10s, I get a mixed feeling of euphoria and utter fear. How the hell did we do that last season? How the hell is anybody up for that? I guess I'm just amazed we were all able to stay relatively intact, and finish the season one step closer to skin cancer, with huge beaming smiles.  I'm excited, don't get me wrong. I'm just kinda numb....how did we do that?
