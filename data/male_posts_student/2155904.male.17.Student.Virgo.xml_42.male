Then he found out he had a haircut in like 30 minutes so he got ready quickly and went to that.  Then he went to Farget and got a present for his dad.  1/3 of his family shopping is done now.  Then he went home and played Madden and won 17-16 in a very great comeback.  Then he killed time and watched MXC couples edition.  That was absolutely hilarious.  The part where on the Romantic Rotating Surfboard of Death the guy tried to like push his girl on the surfboard and then she fell and just toppled over backwards into the water was soooooo very funny.  Insanely funny.  So then later he went over to Kinker's house and then Dr. Phil Lelee and Macaroon came over too.  First they played Madden and made themselves really good but they still sucked.  Then Amed and Skippy came over and they played Halo.  They also played Foosball but Amed was pretty good at that.  Not at Halo though.  In the team tourney they made up Tyke and Dr. Phil Lelee tied with Macaroon (Amed was on his team but really did almost nothing but not die...haha jk Amed you aren't the worst player ever) and that was a lot of fun.  Then he pretty much went home and blogged.  But on the way home he saw a Medina cop in Issaquah.  What is up with that?  Isn't Medina like Seattle?  Why would there be a Medina cop driving in Issaquah?  Maybe it was stolen.  Yeah, musta been it.  And the guy in the cop car was just trying to be like in Vice City where he would kill people and stuff.  Ahhh, good times.  NEATO!
