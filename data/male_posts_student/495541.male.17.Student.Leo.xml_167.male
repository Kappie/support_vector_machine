We've been meeting up with everyone.  Almost everyone is here.  There are still a few people who have not arived yet.  I think tomorrow my brother is showing up.  That makes sense because he has to be doing all his Army stuff.  Yeah.  But he'll be here though.  Other than that I've been hanging out mostly.  Today we went around and looked at the university.  After that I hung around the hotel and watched TV.  I suppose I should probably get some homework done.  I think I might try doing some tonight or something.  That might be a good idea.  I have plunty to do...  I should be getting off here.  I need to go to the wedding rehearsal in an hour and a half.
