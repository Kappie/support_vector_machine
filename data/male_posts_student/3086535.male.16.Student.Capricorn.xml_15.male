Hrm, what's new...Summertime is here, been getting up around noon everyday. I need a job though, been looking but its rough waters out there. Started playing Hollow again, good fun that is. Hmm, Going to There soon, some stupid camp thing my mom and her friends pressured me into going to. That's it, I can't even type now cuz of thinking about THERE. Peace, love and rock N roll.
