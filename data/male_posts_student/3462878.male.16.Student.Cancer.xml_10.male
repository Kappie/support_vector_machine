I think I can reveal to everyone who is reading this (which can't be many, I know), when filling the Pot for the first time, do NOT fill until the line they say you should, that's just crap, and doesn't leave any water for the crappy bits at the bottom.   DO NOT CONFORM TO THE LINE! FIGHT THE POWER!  *Chrizz realizes he's sounding like Kitten from Big Brother, holds head in hands*  *Chrizz realizes he knows too much, runs from room screaming*
