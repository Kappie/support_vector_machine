Now this my friends is the holy mecca, gold mine, moment of euporia, for the videogame world. www.ign.com , my favorite videogame website is posting full coverage of the event. therefore, when i came home and got online john imed me and i realized that videogame history was in the making. on ign.com i found streaming videos of all the most anticipated games. Halo 2, Legend of Zelda, Metroid 2, Viewtiful Joe 2, Starfox, RE4. Lemme tell you i was about to shit in my pants. All of these games look fucking beautiful and are each their own masterpieces. Now, the icing on the cake. Nintendo DS. a new handheld system. it has the graphics capabilities of a Dreamcast (fucking kick ass system) and two back lit LCD screens to boot. Complete with a microphone for voice recognition/command software and live talking over the internet. one of the two screens is designed to be used similarly to a pda for drawing and typing. It looks fucking tight and will revolutionize gaming. o by the way, nintendo anounced their new console. Called Revolution cuz its gonna revolutionize gaming. I cant wait. wanna know why? cuz im gonna be crapping my pants til it come out.
