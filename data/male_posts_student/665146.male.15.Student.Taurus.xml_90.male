And here I am, thinking, "You know, I should probably say something about Leonard Cohen,"  and I swear, I was about to, but besides realizing that all I do is pimp, I also came to the conclusion that I couldn't say anything about Leonard Cohen that hasn't already been said.  And I've got a decent sized vocabulary, I can usually come up with something about anything (granted I know what I'm talking about).  Well, I'm pimping one last thing before I set this place straight:   Rat Tail   The Creative Writing department of the School of the Arts requires that every individual publish his/her own book of poems and short stories as a part of his/her final grade.  We write, cut, paste, draw, organize, type, copy, publish, and pay for all materials that go into it, every individual publisher decides upon a price, and we sell them at the writing events we hold, as well as on our own.      Rat Tail is mine.      Twenty seven pages of poetry, fiction, fat babies, homosexual innuendos, communism, partial nudity, and zoot suits.  Best of all, I'm selling them for a buck each.  That's right.  A buck.  $1.  No more.  (The price is probably why they sold out so fast at the performance.)  My friends and colleagues charged more than $3, $4, $5 a copy, some even going for $9 a copy!  Sure, I could've made more money that way, but why would I make someone pay to read my material when they could just as well go, "Hey, Nick, can I read _____?"  I should be paying the reader to take my writing, just so I can get my stuff out.  However, I'm not that benevolent, so I decided on charging a dollar.   urlLink Send orders to demortius@comcast.net  identifying yourself and I'll send a reply with my personal address.  Put a dollar in an envelope with a return address, and as soon as I can staple seven pages together, you'll receive your copy of Rat Tail in the mail.  Or you Instant Message me on AIM: DemortiusXV.  Or you can skip that and just talk to me in person.   Order before February 29th and I'll take a whole quarter off your order!  That's right, only 75 cents for a copy of Nicholas J. Sanz-Gould's personal collection of writing.  But only if you order before the 29th!     Ok, I'm done pimping.  No more, I swear.  Maybe just one more next week for Umlaut, but nothing needless.
