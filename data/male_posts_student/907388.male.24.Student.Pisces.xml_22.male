We are going through some really hot times. it's soaring mercury levels at around 40C.... And the fact that I don't really have much to do is not much of a comforting thought since I seem to have more tim to kill.  After the excitement of the last few months, both on the career and emeotional front, things seem to have settled down.... Pritam is back to his job and seems to have his hands full.... As for me, I am now bracing up for a tough two years.... by the way, I have a new cell number... 94370-95802. It's too hot to be doing something for such a long time.... even if it's just posting messages... so see you guys... BTW, before I sign off, Yesterday was the birthday of a very special person, and although it had a lot of glitches, I think it was one of the most memorable days of my life.... SAYONARA FOLKS....
