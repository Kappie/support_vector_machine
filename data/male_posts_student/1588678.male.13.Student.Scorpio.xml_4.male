It's at the Greek Theatre in Berkeley. To make things better, the concert is on a Saturday! I can't wait! I'm the biggest White Stripes fan. They are the best band EVER! So if you like Led Zeppelin or Nirvana, you'll love the White Stripes. So go to your local Tower Records or CD store to get some White Stripes CDs. You WILL fall in love with the White Stripes. I guarantee ya.
