Actually I fell asleep real early and then decided that hunting a costume down in the last few moments of the night would not be worth it.  Even though People did come in a keep waking me up, it's a frat house and i knew that stuff when I signed on.  And thats the fun stuff anyway keeps me from becoming a hermit.  The best though was Lasher (Loecher..  i know how to spell it) came in at like 2:30 and needed someone to ref his boxing match with Walker.  So i went down and watched these two drunk fools duke it out.  It was very, very humurous but Lasher did pretty well especially considering the drunk factor.  But other than that I read some more for my speech I have to write for tues. on my main man  urlLink Hunter S. Thompson .  It should end up being pretty interesting.  But i also have a Western Civ paper due Wed.  which will be rough so I don't know if I'm going to go out at all this weekend.  I probably will end up going out tonight though..  I'm not that responsible..  Like I have to assure people of that..   I'm Zeke Burlbaw and Your not..  Goodnight..
