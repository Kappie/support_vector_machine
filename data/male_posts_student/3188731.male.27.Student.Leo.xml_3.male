Friedman seems to be a very interesting person.  urlLink Check out his homepage    The book introduces economics through a number of everyday situations. I haven't finished reading the book yet, in fact just started, but it seems interesting. Even for someone who knows a bit of the formal economic theory.   so long till next time..
