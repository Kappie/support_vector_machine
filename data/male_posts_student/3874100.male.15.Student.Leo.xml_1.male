Were five of us, including Alex, the day was fun to.  Ok, so I go to my main man Sax's at like half two, and danny's there, who later leaves, and then me and Sax hang for a bit, then head off to Aarons, where we hang for a bit, and see Sam! (Who I haven't seen in literally years, he went to live in Wales), so that rocked. Then we went to mine, and the delivery chinese place was shut, as it is on tuesday's, so we ordered one and took the tube to west finchley to get it, we ate and then headed off for Alex's. The tube was fine, despite haven't to have just missed two trains in a row, and having to wait 7 minutes (yes, I know, seven minutes, I'm so hard done by..), we get to Golders Green, where we have to wait around half an hour for a f'n bus to come, one came just as we arrived, but just as we were going to get on, the 'out of service' sign came down, damn!  Anyway, so me and Sax eventually arrive at Alex's palace at about half ten (weird, considering Sax had to leave at 11...meh..), and we're on the trampoline, as per usual. Danny, Re, and Fran were there, which I knew about, but Julian was to, hardcore! We talked on the trampoline for a few...hours, before going in to watch Terminator 2: Judgement Day. What a film! Seriously, one of the most rockin' sequels ever, and the best out of all three terminator films, Arnie is the man! We then chill for a bit, before watching Scary Movie 3, now that was just hilarious, I love that film, I have to watch it again sometime, simply brilliant, the second one was a bit of a let down, but this one really made up for it.  Anyway, talking, blah blah, and Danny falls asleep, so we draw whiskers on his face, hehe, how childish are we? Julian and Fran are making out on the floor, yet I'm the only one who notices this, except Julian..and well, probably Fran as well. Danny wakes up and is pissed at the pen, but oh well.  This was classic, you know how when you wake up in the night, you're kind of half asleep, and have no idea what's going on, well, anyway, we drew a beard on Re's face, and Julian woke up, and was like 'what the hell is on Re's face?', but we cleverly convinced him there was nothing there and he was hallucinating, and he fell for it, hehe...  Anyway, it gets to about 5am, and we go on the trampoline again, it's already been fully light for at least an hour now, so no chance of sleep, Alex's attempt to get on the trampoline without getting his feet wet by using a method of laying down wood, the treading on it worked, but didn't seem like it was worth the trouble, meh. We woke his parents up, shit, but we went in. We then talked for a bit, except Fran was now with Alex, but I don't think they were doing anything, except like looking in each others eyes, and stroking each other (no, not like that..), but that was really cute and stuff. Anyway, we just chilled from then, and drewon Danny.... again, and Julian, and everyone, except me, because I am that hardcore!   The next day me, Julian and Re were discussing how Julian was practically having sex on the floor, (well, not quite), yet nobody but me noticed. Anyway, Julian/Danny/Re went out for a walk, while me and Alex slept, (I went to sleep at about 11am), and poor Fran was feeling sick, so she stayed. Anyway, I left about 1, and phoned my mummy, but she said they'd be nobody home, so I made a stop off at Aaron's for a bit, then went home, where I ate left over chinese, was good.   I then stayed in and played guitar/chilled, went to bed, woke up at like 4:30 the next day, played guitar/chilled, and here I am now, at almost half one, about to watch the DVD of 'Anger Management', whooo!  Anyway, that was a long post that you probably didn't read, Keep on Sleepin', Jonny
