I have a huge ass Bio test I havent studied for so I am screwed. But its not my fault its that bitch's.  She thinks shes helping me out by keeping track of all my shit and staying on my case but she is really making my life worse and making me resent her even more. And then once my grades do go up she will take all the credit and be like "Arent you glad I helped you?" And I say "Hey, guess what! NO! FUCK OFF!"  Oh yeah and here is something a good friend wrote in her diary I thought I'd share:  why do things have to get so complicated as you grow up? why do people have to grow up anyways? and more importantly, how does one draw a line between child and adult? is it really about age or maturity or life experience? im 14 years old and ive experienced the effects of growing up with an alcoholic father and a mentally ill mother. ive experienced love, heartbreak, a first kiss, and a life-threatening situation. sometimes im wise and deep and understanding, and other times i have the mental capacity and maturity level of a six-year-old. how does all that add up? i know im still young, but i feel like my life is passing by too quickly. the past year has gone by so fast. i feel rushed and pressured and burdened with all kinds of responsibilities im not ready for. what ever happened to the simplicity of hopscotch and bubble-blowing? i can hardly remember those days...im so caught up in focusing on here and now that my entire past is just a hazy blur of laughter and tears. and the same is true for any teenager, im sure. we all spend so much time pondering how-come's what-if's and the meaning of life and a million other things that no amount of pondering will ever reveal the answers to. our lives tick away more quickly than we realize while we sit around pondering life instead of living it. but in the end it all seems a waste of time anyways. the older you get, the more weight is put on your shoulders. you have to start figuring things out for yourself. its a long winding road of trial-and-error, filled with mistakes and bad luck and wrong choices. first its the aching hearts and the broken friendships and making the grades. then, before you know it youre being shoved out the door by the hand that once cradled you when you cried, and into the real world where you throw bills and taxes and paperwork into the mix. and you work hard and marry young and have children and grow old and get sick and spend the last three years of your life lying in a nursing home bed, wishing it had all just ended after your hopscotch and bubble-blowing days were over. but instead you were too busy trying to teach and to learn and to make a difference. but it matters not what you had to offer the world or what kind of contributions your bank account allowed you to make, because no one is invincible, and we'll all end up rotting under 6 feet of dirt anyways.
