I wasn't that impressed. I LOVE vanilla coke but I'm not sure I will be drinking the pre-packaged bull shit.  I got a new tattoo tonight. I drove out to Suffer City in Garland becuase I knew that a few of the artist's were scooter fans. I had seen pics of vespas and lambrettas in front of the shop. I get out there around 7:15pm. I had a little trouble finding it. I couldn't remember where I saw the place. I found it eventually. Walked in and Nathan, the first guy I met, he was a pretty nice guy. The place was 'punk rock' which is totally fine with me. There were toys everywhere. I felt like I was at eric and alex's apartment. Toys in wrappers. I don't get it really. What's the point. I talked to another guy, Steve or Steven I can't remember. He was super cool and thought the atom would look good.   I walked in wanting to get one on each arm but had to just go with the right arm for now. It cost $150. seemed high compared to the $200 i spent on the mxpx guy (supposed to be $300 but I snaked a deal.) So maybe it was reasonable. Either way I got it and it hurt and it's big.   I was listening to a radio program around 11 when I went out to the store for some soda. They were talking to kids in Moldova about their parents. Apparently the country is in such bad shape that a quarter of the population has left the country to seek employment abroad. They said that the average yearly salary in Moldova is 150 dollars.   I felt bad.  That was my tat. I could have taken those toys in the wrappers down to the kids with my tattoo money and helped a few. I coulda - shoulda - probably won't. WhY?  Anyways, mimi said she is tired and will leave from snyder tomorrow morning instead of coming home tonight.   I called j.palmer and talked to him for about half and hour. He is doing good. Thats good. I need to push people farther away - getting attached sucks. I don't really need people anyways - thats a lot of shit!
