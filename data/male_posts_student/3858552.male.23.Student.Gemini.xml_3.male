I really don't have any political thoughts today so i'll save that for another day. I suppose I need to be heading back to Starkville soon, but i'm awaiting a "delivery" and don't feel like driving back down to get it later. I really don't want to go to work tomorrow, I hate the MicroHELL. It's such a boring job and has no future. I really hate these college kids who's rich ass parents let them run a muck up in Starkville and buy them Hummers. Back on the hotel, it's such a crock of shit up there, you'd swear we work for Saudis in the way that they are cheap as fuck and try there best to cut our hours and ensure that housekeepers get no hours by making us fold laundry all fucking night! I HATE YOU TRACEY AND CHRIS.. YOU ARE SOME SONS OF BITCHES AND CHEAP AT THAT!   >  I think that sometimes too many taxes come out of my paycheck because I sho feel like I work a hell of a lot for just 200.00 a week and then those bitches wanna sit up there and act like I could be in this job forever.. fuck that. Even at a shitty Mississippi teacher salary, before taxes I would bring home 2250.00 a month which is a far fucking cry from 800.00, not to mention no weekend or night work! I really picked the right major for my lazy ass. One sweet day I will be able to tell them to go to hell.. as if i don't already, but then i'll do it while walking out the door for good! I'm ready for school to start back, not necessarily for something to do, but rather to SHORTEN my time even more in this miserable poor college kid life. Oooh, next week we move into the new house, i'm so excited! We are gonna be up in the rich neighborhood until one of us becomes to poor to pay rent then we all gonna be living on the street. Well, I suppose I have ranted enough for the day so i'll end this with a usual FUCK ALL REPUBLICANS statement.
