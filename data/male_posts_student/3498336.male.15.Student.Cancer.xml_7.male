I didn't remember there being so many last year.. maybe there weren't.. but OK.. Mr. Merritt made me be the model for Remington going-up.. I hate playing in front of people.. well.. it wasn't that bad..We played the opener.. and like no one was getting letter E right.. well the first kinda were.. we still messed up though.. and yah  Matt and Chris taught the fish the Indian song and some other stuff.. that was interesting..  Well thats about all that happened today at Summer Band... WOO......
