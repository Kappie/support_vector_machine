Conformists to non-conformism. The TRUE non-conformist does not bother to state their non-conformity in any special way. They are confident in their lifestyle, and are happy with what they are. And they are un-labelablebleble... Sorry to bring up this argument, but it does lead on rather nicely to a richer seam. Most people who turn up to 'goth' boards generally open with 'if i had to say i was nething i ould b a goth but i think that lablss r stupid and evri1 is differnt ' (sic. all the way through). But then I bet that if you went round to these peoples' houses you would find Nike bags, Adidas trainers, McDonald's packaging... Everyone is the same. They all conform to what their friends want and expect, and give little care for their own feelings. (To sound worringly like a pop-psychologist.) And they TRY to justify it; 'Yes, but if I have a really good bag from Nike then everyone thinks I am -' 'A brainwashed idiot who believes the tide of marketing that spews forth from the TV?' '- really cool.' It's all so depressing.
