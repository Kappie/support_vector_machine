     

      A must-see site for those interested in animation. Along with iFILM, one of the best collections of animations on the web... Wired's  urlLink Animation Express . This site has things in all formats, from Flash to Video to GIF, and in all styles, traditional 2D/3D, stop-motion and more. You could spend a long time watching all of the clips. And they're open to submissions!
