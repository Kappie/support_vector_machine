As I had been saying, my birthday has come and gone. I have been gone from this blog recently due to a game I got for my birthday. I have probably been playing this game too much, but meh, it isn't like I have anything else to do.    Inspiration has struck and I feel like drawing something, I'll get to that in a bit.    My uncle is in town, he took me to get soccer kletes, we went for a bike ride and other fun stuff.    We are contemplating going to Black Hills (sounds like a place out of LOTR)    I'm sorry, inspiration is killing me. I must go    Hakuna Matata,  Anita
