Some stuff happened between my girlfriend and I, I won't elaborate because it's our fucking business. Let's just say I was the one who unded up being upset. On to other things. I will never play no chip value poker. I don't see what's the point of not making the chips worth something. If you can't tell my by now, I lost. I guess it's the fact that I, at first, have the better hand then everyone else gets lucky and ends up beating me. To cap off the night it's raining. What a great fucking day. Sorry for the explicit language but it hasn't been a real good day. Stay classy San Diego.
