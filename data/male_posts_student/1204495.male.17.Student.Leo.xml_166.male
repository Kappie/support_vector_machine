Ever just stopped and wondered what has caused our world to go like this? Back in the 1950's there was a sense of community spirit, people enjoyed doing what they were doing, be it at college, at school, driving a bus, or working in a factory, they enjoyed it and made the most of it, why can't our world be like that today in this day and age, we may of moved on but surely if we look we can still find that sense of community spirit, surely we must be able to, if we can't then there is something severly wrong with the world today. Just stop and look. Look at what you see all around you and then think what can you do about it
