So left home at 1pm.Wee Loong tagged along cause he couldn`t get a ride.Ryan was suppose to come but he was at school for drama practise I think and could`nt make it back before we left..and got there within like twenty minutes of leaving home..not as far away as I thought but it was much futher in than I thought it was...So like called Raimie and he wasn`t there yet!I mean what an idiot!You SHOULD be there at the Venue first before those that you invite to go!Anyway me and Wee Loong walked around the place..woah...exclusive man...walked around the pool...found the bowling alley area and the snooker room and what not..then got onto the roof of some place..weird...anyway we went back to that main hall area and sat and waited for Raimie..Loong like practicly fell asleep waiting and after like half an hour or so finaly Raimie and Syamir came...Syamir was over at Raimies place and what not..  So anyway went down to meet them at the snooker and bowling place and played a game of snooker which took like ages to complete...took ages to get the yellow ball out of the way..good grief and I displayed my true suckiness at pool :p .Heh.Raimie and Syamir all nicely smoking there like they own the place and had chewing gum for cover.Haha.How nice.Loong took a puff but he said it was shitty and obviously I wasn`t even interested in trying a single bit.In fact I was moving away from them to get away from the secondary smoke.Pissheads.I mean what kinda ideas smoke in an air-condition room?/Lol there was also a no smoking area sign.Lmao.Disrespect man!Hahaha.  Then went for lunch at the Caf√© there...so like me and Syamir both had chicken chop while Raimie (yuck girls call him Rai..thats so gay!) and Loong had fish and chips and he orderd chicken wings which soon ended having a fight for it :p.  Then went bowling hahahaha damn screwed up la...Hahah I got 3rd the 1st game and 3rd for the second game with 98!and I started it off with a strike!Ugh!hahaha Raimie who WON THE 1st game!Finished last.haha..Damn I screwed up man..really..I did..Anyway hahaha Raimie changed his name or Syamir did to Natasha and like haha he got strikes in two frames in a row so we wanted him to get one more so the screen would go like 'X triple' haha sick man..Hmm hear he`s been going out everyday of the holidays which is like causing his parents or at least his mom to interogate him all the time on where he`s going and with who..And he and Sue are like on the verge of breaking up?cause its like she wants to wait for her SPM to be over..hmm...anyway like Syamir wasn`t suppose to be there cause he`s been grounded like the whole year cause he had to stay back so much at school for Kadet crap..but Raimie sweet talked his mom into letting him out and when she asked Syamir,"you going with Raimie right?" he was like "umm yeah!"..haha..  Ok soon after that me and Loong left...Damn the Sultan of dunno where was there..red carpet and all laid out man..Damn..who will I see next?1st Sheila Majid then Harith Iskandar ,now the Sultan..now who`s next?Kurt Cobain? Eh no wait he`s dead :p.  Then went home and lepak and then later at like 9:30pm went out to collect my Guess Glasses from the shop and its with new lens and all!Wohoo!Then went TMC and got Milk and Ginger Ale!I love ginger ale..somehow I can`t quite really stand and also like ginger beer..  Okay now I have this add-diction to:   The Used - Blue and Yellow Dj Tiesto - Love Comes Again Josh Groban - Per Te  Wow dammit I really want that new Josh Groban album!It`s really good actually..  According to Brendan Otak Tak Center (A play about 2 ppl with different mental problems that still somehow create a bond within eachother and get along and also shows how mental problem patients are like and what not..)which is at the Panggung Bandaraya on Jalan Raja Laut I think,is quite good...but I dunno..its until the 13th which is like this Sunday..the tickets aren`t that expensive..but I dunno the times and who id go with so looks like I wont be going!Maybe..next time perhaps??  Ok hmm onces again im staying up so late to blog..o dear its the 10th of June already!Thursday!What happened to all the beautiful days of the holidays??Damn ive been so busy and I aint got time to do my website!No!!!!!!But i`m not that unhappy about it but I still wish I could make it..and certainly a few days isn`t enough time to make it..  Anyway I think thats all for now..maybe going to 1 utama today to go shopping and stuff..hehe..ok nite people!Oh yeah I put up a very strong comment of opinion on Michelle`s blog just now which is gonna cause some shockwaves I hope and belive!hehe..its funny though I have to say though some wont find it as humourous as I do!
