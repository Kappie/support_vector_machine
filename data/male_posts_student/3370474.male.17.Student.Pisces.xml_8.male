So many bad memories rushed in, making me feel like as if I am nothing more but a mindless drone.  I thought of my mixture of untimely poisons, but something, or someone was holding me back from consuming its sweet taste.  What has happened to me? Why could I not enter the razor deeply within me? Why could I not carve away my life? Why could I not consume my poison?   I live now for another few days, until I regain the strength to attempt a new sacrifice.  We need the sweet touch of a crystal blade upon our open flesh.  We must be punished.
