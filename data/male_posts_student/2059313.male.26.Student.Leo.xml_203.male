Not the best I've done, but definitely not the worst.  It was good.  Went to eat at Denny's afterwards... oh the memories of Denny's.  My town got rid of their Denny's and put in a Liquor Mart.  What crap.  I miss the Moons over Myhammy, the Grand Slam, American Slam, and French Slam breakfasts.  Their cheese eggs were some of the best.  Ahhh... late night at Denny's. [sigh] The good old days.
