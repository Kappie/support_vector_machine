Oh man what a game that was, the Nets won 127-120 over the Pistons, I cant believe it went triple overtime, wow wat a fun couple of days to be watching basketball playoffs.........I do have to say this was one of the ugliest games ive ever seen, terrible offense, too many fouls...like half of each team fouled out and the overtime was like watching a bunch of high schools kids through a ball off a brick wall cause these teams could not shoot, they scored 127 points in 3 overtimes, do you have any idea how many points the Mavs would score in 3 over times ? The Mavs score 127 in a single game, add on 15 mins of game time, thats another quarter so another 30-35 points ? The Eastern Conference needs a clinic on how to play offense..
