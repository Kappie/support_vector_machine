That's right, I said it. And I believe it.    Perhaps I spoke too soon about Netflix. Today, waiting for me in the mailbox was  Pee Wee's Big Adventure ,  Dummy , and  Le DÃ®ner de cons  ( The Dinner Game )! Three of my movie picks! Hurrah! I want to have people over this weekend to watch movies. Anyone want to?    Also, we're all seeing  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind . I'm in deep need for a Kaufman/Gondry fix.    And I'm finally going to go to Talbert with Jenny, after three weeks of delaying it and delaying it and delaying it.    Man, I'm crazy nervous. Our presentation is tonight. The fourteen people in our class spent the last two days collaborating on a PowerPoint Presentation. Each of us has a small section that we have to talk about. I have to give an overview of what we studied these past three weeks. Something like six slides. Only about threeish minutes of talking. And I made four of the five GIS maps, which are all very professional looking.    I need to go practice. Wish me luck?
