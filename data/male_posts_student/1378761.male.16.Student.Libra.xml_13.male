I will let you know some of the exciting points of my day (not to many). So lets BLOG!!  Well I really didn't do to much today. I think I had a little hangover from last night (oh well). I started to watch Bad Boy 2 when I was rudely interrupted by the phone. It was Doug. He wanted to know if I wanted to help him but some Big Bear signs in Wess's yard. Like I said before, I already told others that I did not feel good tonight but how could I but this kind of offer down? So we ended up putting some signs in his yard. How fun!  By the way, send me some emails about the site! Any email would be great (not spam lol). Its  urlLink webmaster@ericville.net . Don't Be Shy!  I think that's about it for now. Until next time, HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!  (Lets hope 2004 will be a good one!) 2004~Eric~2004
