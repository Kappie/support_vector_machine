I've got two big ass beige (oh dear) 17 inch CRTs which look really geeky, but then again I'd rather save the money I'd spend on replacing them, on a gap year touring the world. It's definitely nice to have all the stuff like instant messengers and email assigned to one screen though, leaving plenty of room for other crap on your main monitor.  I also had my first driving lesson today, which was awesome. Driving seems to be so much easier than I imagined. I guess it's like anything new you try; once you get used to it, you're away (just like learning to ride a bike). I'm going to be having one or two lessons a week and hopefully I'll be alble to go for the full test in about 3 or 4 months' time (the waiting list is that long!)
