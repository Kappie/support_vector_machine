I forgot to tell you that I tried to move is yesterday after Butch (a friend of my grandpa) adjusted the carburator a little.  But the wheels that are on the car were only held on by two lug nuts and they were to big so one of the wheels fell off :(  Anyway... we had just put those steel wheels on to keep it off the ground.  I'm sitting here thinking about the offset of these new wheels and if they will stick out or not... I really hope not... we'll see tomorrow I guess!
