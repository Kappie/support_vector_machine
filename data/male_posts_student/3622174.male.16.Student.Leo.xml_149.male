When I left for Camp Orlando on the 19th, I knew that my Blogger addiction would have to die down a little, because I wouldn't have much time to Blog in between Camp Orlando and my trip to New York.  And I didn't realize how little time I had to blog between Monday, when I returned, and Tuesday, when I went to school to help sell yearbooks and things.  I ended up at the school all of last week, minus Monday.  Today is the first day, in 3 whole weeks, that I'll actually be staying at home for the entire day, not going anywhere, not doing anything... I've NEVER been this busy before.  So, today, I'm going to post exactly what happened during those three weeks.  Nerdular Nerdance was already posted for Camp Orlando, but here are my final thoughts:   Camp Orlando:  The mecca for yearbook staffers.  The one and only Yearbook-Con.  Camp Orlando WAS better this year than last year, definitely, even though it didn't seem like it.  It was much different this year, because the past two years, it was only either me (2002), or me and Adam (2003) in the same room.  This year, we had me, Adam, Jonny Lively, Alex, and Jarrod.  So, obviously, things were a little louder and funnier.  The security guard incident was the funniest thing that could happen to a group of 5 guys.  The class I was in was really good.  The teacher that I had was pretty cool, we learned a lot of cool Photoshop tricks (and as soon as I get my computer's new CD drive, I'll be able to put Photoshop on here to do those tricks), and that was just a good experience.  Universal was great with just me, Alex, and Lauren, because lately, I hate being around big groups of people for long periods of time, not to mention, Revenge of the Mummy was awesome.  So, even though it didn't seem like it was a good year for Camp Orlando (mainly because of a certain event that put me in a bad mood), this year's camp was the best so far.  Hopefully Alex, Jarrod, and Jonny Lively will have an even better year next year.   New York:  This trip was incredibly long, incredibly boring, and incredibly sleep-losing.  There were a couple of perks, like going to the Paramount Carowinds park in the Carolinas, and going to Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, VA, but, this was a really boring trip otherwise.  There's nothing really to do in New York, aside from seeing the grandparents, but, the town is boring, and it gives me nothing to do.  Oh well.  I had to buy stuff to keep me busy, so I bought the Back to the Future trilogy on DVD, Top Spin for my Xbox, and Lord of the Rings, and I'm currently reading that today.  I'm glad to be back from that, because those ten days went by way too long.    Work at TRHS:  I worked at the school Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday to prepare for the upcoming school year.  I sold quite a few books and senior ads, created some forms for our new organization for the yearbook, and worked senior pictures, and had mine done, too. Today and tomorrow are the only days I have now before school starts...boy, that should be fun.  So, I've had a very busy three weeks, and now I've finally had time to post about it.  My Random Ramble was just spat out, and I really don't think about what I post.  Now, school is about to start, thus entering a period of time when Blogging will be more fun.  This year is my senior year, and it is sure to be filled with a new level of drama, new friends, and all sorts of other things that will undoubtedly happen this year.  How will it go?  You'll have to stick with Blog of Bagel to find out what's going on this school year.  I'll probably have time for a quick morning post before I leave.  Then, I leave the Blogger for the school day, and then come home, post about what happened during the day.  Then, I'll go to Digital Lust for the daily update.  Then, I'll go back to Blog of Bagel and post more.  But, don't count on continuous posts...I do want to try and expand my social life somewhat.  This fall is going to be completely different.  Hope I can handle it.  That's it from me for now.  I'll be back later on with more stuff.
