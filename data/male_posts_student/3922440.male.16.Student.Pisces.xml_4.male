So we are continuing to get to know each other and then who knows maybe one day we will be an item.   It turns out he is looking for Mr. Right and he is choosing carefully and I understand that.  So I am willing to wait.  Then there was problems with Amanda and myself problems invoving a extra ticket for a concert we are going to.  We over invited people so that was our first problem then she was telling me who i had to invite out of Michael and Katie, and altho Katie is the logical choice i am pissed cuz I wanted Michael to go.  So we had to decide who to invite my friend Katie or the guy I like Michael.  Well it turns out Michael has to work the night of the concert so he is not able to go anyways which to be truthful is the only reason that Katie is getting the extra ticket.  Cuz I luv Katie but I like Michael as well.  That solved the problem of having to decide who was going to go.  However the up side to it all is that now Michael and I are going to the movies tomorrow.  Yay go me.  And I am really happy.  So now I am really happy cuz I am going out, as friends tho :( , with the guy that I really really like.  Anyhow that is everything that is going on in my life.  I have to go tho cuz I do need to start an introduction for my English paper.
