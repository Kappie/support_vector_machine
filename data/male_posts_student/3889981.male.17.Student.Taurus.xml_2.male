I had a great week, and like any other person recently released from the bondage of metal-in-mouth I had a fantastic time eating anything I wanted. Sticky, spicy, jelly - I enjoyed them the most in this week.  Then came something that would spoil my less-than-perfect week.  Retainers.  Firstly, it didn't taste very good. I am in no position to complain on taste of orthodontic material, but trust me, that wasn't the most sickening part.  15 minutes after my debut wearing the retainers - I took the transparent one, since, being the cheapskate, it was the least expensive - I began to feel my lips drying up.  All the saliva was stuck on the retainers. Urgh.  Worst of all - my articulation is now terrible. Ash in, my articulashun ish naw terrible.  And the dentist says it'll be another half-a-year until she determines if I still require my retainersh. She isn't optimistic about my chances though - I'd most probably have to wear them till the end of next year.  )^*^*%(%%(%$^$@#$!#$%!#$%!#$%   The following was too difficult to interpret for the human ear. Upon machinery interpretation it seems that the blogger was attempting to utter a string of profanities about the last part of orthodontic treatment - the retainers.
