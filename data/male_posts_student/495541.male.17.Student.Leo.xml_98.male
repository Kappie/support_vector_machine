I've been working really hard on halbe.org and getting it updated and everything.  I actually have some interesting articles and stuff up there right now.  You should check them out if you haven't already.  They're pretty entertaining and informative.  Anyways, today and yesterday I worked on getting my mom's new computer working.  I installed Windows 2000 Professional, Office XP, Quicken and TurboTax.  Pretty much everything and only everything she'll ever use on it.  My dad bought her a beautiful new LCD flat-pannel display.  The thing is so bright, it puts my monitor to shame.  I'd honestly say I'd rather have that if I could run it at a higher resolution.  The one she got only goest up to 1024x768.  Nonetheless though, it looks brilliant.  Anyways, I installed all those applications and got a million and one software updates.  So many service packs and security updates for Internet Explorer.  I was tempted to install Mozilla but figured she'd never figure it out or like it.  Well I got the thing together and everything.  I had to find a driver for the old USB ethernet adapter I used.  I put it on a floppy only to find that the floppy drive on the computer worked only when it felt like it.  So I went over to my dad's laptop and burnt a cd of it that I found on the internet.  I put it in there and went trough the driver install only to find it was the wrong driver.  After trying the thing over and over I then realized that and went to look at the actual divice behind my mom's huge desk.  I couldn't see it so I had to search the house for a flashlight.  I couldn't find one so by this point, I'm pissed.  I finally find one under the seat of my mom's Tahoe.  I look back there and find out the actual divice number of the adapter.  I found it and then went and had to burn another driver onto the CD.  I was glad the CD let me add more to it because if it didn't I would have wasted a CD only making me more mad.  So I go it the internet working.  I was happy about that.  I later put my CD burner in it and waited for my new Sony drive to show up.  After I did that, my brother, my mom and I went out with our grandparents to lunch.  We were going to go to Bennigans but they were pretty booked.  We eneded up going to Bishop's buffet.  I was pretty hungry because I didn't have breakfast.  The food was pretty good.  I had myself some fried chicken and about 6 rolls all buttered up.  I tell ya, those were some good rolls.  Yup that was good.  We then proceded to go to the Disney store to get my sister an Eeore stuffed animal she wanted.  The thing's huge.  She's going to like it.  That's pretty much it.  Night.
