Around the corner from the hotel we spotted a small restaurant and popped in for some breakfast. For an amazing 24 yuan (less than 2 pounds) we had some dumplings in soup with a side order of vegetables that yuqi and i had never tried before. It was really really nice, we'll have to eat there again before we leave shanghai :)  after that, it was straight into a taxi and off to see a famous garden in the city called yu yuan. Once out of the taxi, we got a little lost because the garden was inside a pedestrianised shopping area which was surrounded by shops and walls. This meant we couldn't see the garden from outside the shopping street and there were no visible signs either. The area was clearly a tourist hotspot, i saw more western people here than any other place so far. This was reflected in the shops, where every other one i passed had someone shouting "hello hello hello" at me. After working in sales for 4 years, my instincts tell me that's not the best way to get someone into your shop!  Once we'd found the correct place, we crossed a lovely zig-zag bridge into the entrance. The garden itself was absolutely beautiful, with several very traditional buildings. In a couple of places were large ponds, with some of the biggest goldfish i've ever seen! The actual area of the garden was quite small, However the paths twisted and turned all over the place. Often, we'd end up somewhere we'd already seen, but from a different direction. It was a little confusing, but meant we saw the garden from every angle the creators intended.  About 2pm, the temperature was really really hot, so we decided to stop for a drink and then head to "the bund". The bund is an area bordering shanghai's enormous river (huang pu jiang) where you can walk and see the sights. Standing at the bund, looking over the river, you can see the pu dong area of shanghai. This area is the one most people will refer to when talking about shanghai. There are loads of huge skyscrapers, mostly overshadowed by shanghai's most famous building, the tv tower.  The tower stands at over 350m tall (it's taller than that, but that's the highest visitors can go) and is shaped in a very futuristic way. To get to it, we went into a subway and took a small train under the river. The train was obviously designed to be a ride for children and had several lighting effects on the way. Once above ground on the other side of the river, we entered the tv tower. At the bottom of the tower, was a queueing area and gallery where we waited for the lift. Once ready, they squeezed about 20 of us into the rather small lift, and we started our ascent. The lift took us at 7 metres per second up to 263 metres high, causing our ears to pop a couple of times.  The view from the top was spectacular. Although a little hazy, we could see for miles around. Shanghai is a city that takes on a whole new beauty when viewed from above. You just can't imagine how many massive buildings are in shanghai, you'll need to see the many photos i've taken ;)  we neglected to go to the 350 metre viewing gallery owing to the whopping 24 pounds extra to pay. We were quite happy with the view we'd already seen. As a quick reference, the shen yang tv tower took us up 200m compared to the 263m here.  We took another packed lift back to the ground and hopped on the return train under the river. After a couple of short breaks for drinks and ice-cream, we spent the rest of the afternoon browsing a busy shopping street.  We bought a few bits and pieces before heading back to the hotel. We've got an early start tomorrow for our day tour to hang zhou.  Interesting china fact #5 - compared to the english, at a first glance, chinese seems to do a lot of things backwards. Firstly, dates are always given as year, month, day. Similarly, addresses on post are written with the country, province and city at the top, with the road and house number underneath. Beware also, that in buildings, the chinese count the ground floor as the first floor.
