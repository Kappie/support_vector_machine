Right now my GPA is 3.275 and parent-teacher conferences are next Wednesday. The GPA isn't  so  bad I guess....but it's the fact that I have C+'s in two classes. I have a feeling they  might  have gone up to B-'s but maybe not. Still, my mother is not going to be happy. My mother said if I got any C's at all my life would change drastically (meaning no Europe this summer)...even though it's only a quarter grade and I usually get A-'s and above at the semester. Wow, I'm just, stressed. I need more sleep and maybe some yoga or something.
