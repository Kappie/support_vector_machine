Tuesday night I had nothing really to post about, like Mattson said. Wednesday night I was shot from Valleyfair - I didn't even check this place.   It would be great if I could add to that scavenger hunt list. I've racked my brain for days on end, thinking of things that would be awesome to hunt down and videotape, such as a human pyramid made of 6 foodservice employees, a doctor singing "Hakuna Matata," a member of your team insulting 4 different people and getting a reaction out of at least 1, and, the highest point amount, Adam Pelkey.   Camping is okay. I'm not a big fan of s'mores, which seem to take up 3/4 of my family's camping experience, and I'm not a big fan of throwing all mankind's technology and other advances over 10,000 some years out the window and "roughing it," but it's bearable.  Bryce is like memory retention... something... don't know where I'm going with this. His piano skills astound me, and he's had no formal training like myself. Rubiks cube... He programs his TI-83 often better than I, and I don't even know if he read the programming chapter in the manual. Maybe I just taught him real well. I'll lie that sweet lie to myself...  Wednesday I went to Valleyfair with the church and the absolute two people I least expected to come along... well, actually no, I'd less expect like Dan Rather or Al Sharpton...nevermind. Chris Oseland and Deutsch Niehoff were both there. Chris... not even gonna start there, but I though Deutsch was back in Deutschland. I guess not.   Galaxies and Beyond. Seriously, transcribe a raw draft and I'll throw my cuts and editorials in there too. We stretched that novel 123 pages at least... 4th thru 6th grade, oh man. With excellence to rival someone like Timothy Zahn. Or whoever wrote Rogue Squadron. No, that guy rocked. Whoever wrote Wraith Squadron. That's better. He's worse, is what I mean. Not saying Tim Zahn's bad, he's just the first Star Wars writer that came to mind.   My song picks... Tribute - Tenacious D Walking in Memphis - Billy Joel and Elton John (I don't have this one. Actually, I've never heard it. But Joe Henke has it on his iPod, and the two greatests artists to ever have lived plus an excellent song cannot be bad) Something Rod Stewart, I'm thinking You're In My Heart, the final reprise. or whatever Also the Beatles, right now I'm on sgt peppers lonely hearts club band, but that could easily change.  I'm off to tennis. Let's do something friday nite.
