LOL... anyway its like1:20 now... and the temperture is a bombing 32 in my house. Im sorry, BUT THATS WAY TO FREAKING HOT... But i guess the good thing is is that my parents bought this like pool thing that you can sit in... Provides much coolness indeed.   We had a little mini earthquake here a c0uple days ago. Happened at like 1 in the morning, i felt it as i was still awake from the heat... STOOPID HEAT...   Ill be going to Calgary in about 15 days. Probably gonna be even hotter there... but there i can go swimming everyday at the pool in the clubhouse :D. James is coming along this time.. but isnt stay at my grandparents. So me, James and Christian can go Go-Karting and Paintballing and stuff together this time :D. Happy Fun Time:D.   As for summer so far... It's been boring as hell... Pretty much all ive done this summer so far is gone to see Spiderman2, IROBOT. They were both awesome movies, but it still doesnt beat hanging out somewhere with someone... But of course most people are going to rivers and stuff.. I dont like rivers... PAIN....   This is why i dont like rivers :(...      (for those of you who dont know what that is... Its the bottom of my foot)   Yeah... took like 10 stiches to heal up like that... Dont have a picture of it all bloody.. was quite the site though :D   **EDIT**  It like 8:18 PM now.. and I just got back from a little swim in the pool in my backyard.... SOOOOO REFRESHING!!!! Ive never experienced so much pleasure in a 20 minute period... Cooled me down greatly in the heat!... AHHH... lol yeah..  I called Christian a little earlier and he was being a complete dumbass. EXAMPLE** 4+4=?... yeah took him like 3 tries to get it right... Yeah hes got work tomorrow and if he doesnt ask his supervisor person about taking some time off im gonna have to kill HIM... and hes gotta call the bus station to see if we can purchase tickets from here to leave Princeton otherwise this is gonna get alot more complicated... Which is really not gonna help..  Ok done for today
