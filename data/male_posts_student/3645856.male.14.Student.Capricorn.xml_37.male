He wrote a book about a love story that took place where I used to hang out down in Cape Hatteras, Rodanthe (chicamacomaco), entitled  Nights in Rodanthe , if I recall correctly. He also wrote the book Message In A Bottle, which had a movie made after it. Anywho, it seems as if it's the only thing worth watching since the only other two things playing are The Princess Diaries 2 and Spiderman 2... what is it with all these superhero movies... Haven't they gone a bit overkill on those already. We need more sci-fi, suspense, comedy, and romance. The last thing I want to see is Tobey Maguire in a suit chasing green goblins because he was bitten by a spider, trying to save the love of his life. Anywho.. I feel like seeing the notebook but it's playing at 3:30, 6:00, 8:30... I'd like to take a walk or something. I don't like this town's atmosphere sometimes. It's too innocent looking...  ~ George
