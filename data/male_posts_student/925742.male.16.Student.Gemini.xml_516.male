Even more gross than spitting a one foot loogie on my arm.  He was pissing in the sink.  My god.  Ugh.  I'm out of school, and on Friday (the last day) I worked.  Later that night, I went to Tara's and watched bad boys 2.  And then after work on saturday, she breaks up with me.  Haha.  Weird.  Anyway, Friday, I got my parts, and saturday, derek screwed the mobo in, and I did the software work, installing bios, drivers, testing, benchmarking.  Anyway, turns out, my computer is 2x faster now.  *ha ha ha*  I saw Troy last night, my god it was awesomely cool.    So I have two ideas on getting yet another female counterpart. One, I get to know a certain girl I've been talking to for a while Two, I ask Rod how the fuck he gets so much poon, study his ways, and reap the benefits of being a playa.  Thats all I can think of now.  I start driver's ed soon.   Meh, sorry about the grammar.
