Why, it's so good, that if the RIAA troopers kicked down my door, beat the shit out of me, and locked me away in Atomic Fusion State Penitentiary, in the center of The Sun, it would still have been worth it. Well, maybe the new Modest Mouse album isn't  that  good, but it's close. It's a lot smoother than their previous stuff, and I really dig that. It's like it has been polished with a soft rag while secretly drugged and "reconditioned". I'm also about to burn some CDs for Molly, namely the four Pixies albums I own, and a copy of "Good news for people who love bad news". It's great to know that I can deliver so much entertainment at no cost to myself. It's as if CD-Rs grow on trees in my house. Magical trees in my green-house.   Also.  Already made the plan. When I turn 17, I'm going to get my restricted license. I'm then going to install a mount for my iPod on my dashboard. Allowing me the massive pleasure of driving around listening to great music. Step three consists of asking Molly if she'd like a ride. Then I (or we) drive head first away from South Orange. We'll live off the land and music, making our way westward. Eventually I reckon we'd have to rob a hip record store to refill. Step five, push my car off the coast and watch it accordian on the rocks below. Step six is the most important, because it's a mystery.  Even though I said I would work on some Heartsmackingz, it never happened, and probably won't for a while. As the end of school and our summer show draw nearer every day band practice and homework seem to be sucking my free-time dry. If you looked inside my chest you would find a small dried raisin titled "joy and lollygagging". At least the KP  practicing is paying off. We perfected a hot and mysterious song today, and it was really a blast to perform. I just hope we can learn the rest of our designated covers come  urlLink June 12th . This show seems extra important to me, simply because of the inherent visibility. It makes me so proud that people living next to or even near to Flood's Hill have no choice but to be rocked.  "A robot with a car can get from here to Canada in eight hours.  urlLink Rogue Retrieval  was faster than that, and they recovered my car too."
