But instead of going out of my firends everyday (which I didn't do at all), I stayed at home the past few days accept for the many solo trips to different Christian bookstores (haven't been to SKS yet). I've bought two books so far. 'Paul, A Novel' and 'How To Read The Bible For All Its Worth'. Though I'm not exactly sure whether I'll have time to read them, especially after the Mid-Year Examinations, now that I have come to realise that I'd better catch up with my revision. Furthermore, the Chinese 'O' levels and Band Overseas Trip will be coming up soon.  So there are two main obligations that I'm experiencing now. Mainly, the obligation to relax, and the obligation to study (for my Chinese). And it wouldn't take a genius to know that they are contradicting or conflicting thoughts (will sound much cooler). So it's kinda hard to do work now. But, I'm planning to start Chinese revision as soon as I get done with my Mom's documents, and making final preparations for Sunday School First Half this Sunday.  Talked to Emilia yesterday. Oh, she's such a fun dude. Sometimes I wonder if its because of the society over at Canada. She just seems like she's having fun in life. Singaporean students, can't live outside the textbooks. Maybe its a minority. Cause my school friends are still having fun. And in fact, some of us are having fun studying. (that's a rare species, I'm sure)  OK, I guess that'll be an effective update. If any special, unique, thought provoking thoughts (which only come only when I read or have too much time to think) come into my mind, I'll just post it in another entry.
