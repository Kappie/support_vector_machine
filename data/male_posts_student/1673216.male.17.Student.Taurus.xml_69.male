Not worried about finals, not nervous about prom (or lack therof at this point in time), nothing else. I am waiting for AFS to accept me into their German program. If I am accepted, I will be going to Germany for a whole semester next year..Although I have this terrible feeling that I wont get in. That will suck...so much..Anyways, that's it. Anxious.  Conversation of the day:  "Hey." "I see your hey and raise you a "What's up" "..." "It's a joke son." "I see." At this point the a loud snapping noise rings through both people's head and everything goes completely black. They both wake up in a white room, dead. Tied upside-down from the ceiling via heavy chain. Thier souls fall to the ground, stumble around, and mutter something about the room smelling funny. The bodies hang motionless.
