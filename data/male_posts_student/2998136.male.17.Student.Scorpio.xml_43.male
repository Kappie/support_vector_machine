The aurthor is humorous and creative the way he described his encounter in his daily life. Check out his latest addition that how desperate he was trying to eliminate all the mouses in his room and you will know why he is humorous. Oh lastly, need I say it out? He is gay.  Overall, I will give the rating 4 out of 5 stars for his blog. It was nice smooth read and it never bore me.  Blog URL: http://gaygaybrad.blogspot.com/ Rating: 4 out of 5 Stars
