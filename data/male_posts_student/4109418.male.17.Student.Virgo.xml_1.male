I guess it's the fact that he's 19 years old and the "greatest all-around swimmer in the world" and has record-breaking ambitions, setting and shattering his own world records, and aiming for the improbable (well, now it's impossible) eight gold medals to surpass Spitz's seven at the Munich games. He's only two years old than me, and look and all he's done and is still doing. If that's not an inspiration, I don't know what is.  He's inspired me to get back in shape. I want to run a mile under six minutes again, something I haven't been able to do since I was a sophomore. I want to run a quarter of marathon under an hour again, again something I haven't been able to do since sophomore year. I want to clean-and-jerk 225lb. (185lb. during football). I want to bench 405lb. (315lb. is no longer a goal, but a benchmark. Literally.) I want to do a lot of things, and the first step is to quit smoking. I went an entire day without a cigarette yesterday, and I have yet to smoke today. I smoked my last cigarette Saturday night, cleaned out my ashtray and put away my lighters. Though quitting smoking is a good first step towards getting fit again, I haven't been able to stop eating. Maybe I'm eating normally and I'm just being paranoid. But in any case, getting fat would be counterproductive towards my goal. I guess the whole quitting smoking and gaining weight sort of balance each other out.  I'm going to run three times a week, swim twice a week, and lift five times a week. Since New Year's is still a bit off, this is my New School Year Resolution. Let's see how long I can stick to it. Or if I even begin with.  Watching women's gymanstics is just depressing. These girls are younger than I am, and they're already world champions. Michael Phelps is inspiring. These girls are depressing. Go figure. But for the first time ever Morgan and I agree on something: Courtney Kupets and Carly Patterson are the best.
