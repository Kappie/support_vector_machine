GOD IS GOOD!!! man god is doing so much in my life, and not just me specifically. so much happening around me that i am taking in. other ppls lives... its all very exciting.  i feel ova the last while god has really built me up as a person. not much happended spiritually for a long while. but ova that space of time god was making me a much better person. so much more patient, and tolorant. and now he is really moving in me spiritually. the church service on sunday night about a passion for god,  that was really encouraging. and now i am reading a book called addicted to god that looks like it will really change me as a person. the first thing it said.  that being day 1, was to be thankful in all circumstances. not being thankful for the circumstance but being thankful in it. like the passage, "i complained that i had no shoes until i met a man that had no feet". how about that, pretty kool  hey.  oh and a special thank you for megan for the book. great b'day pressy!
