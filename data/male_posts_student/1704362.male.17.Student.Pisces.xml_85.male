Conor looks up at the sky, seeing the bright silouette of the rock bear directly on him. He moves into a fighting stance. The asteroid hits Earth's atmosphere several miles above Conor, burning it instantly into superheated plasma. The sky above Conor lights up as the asteroid barrels toward him. The deafening noise of sonic booms pierce his ears. The instant before the rock hits the ground, Conor swings a punch with all his might.  The asteroid slams into Conor, immediately vaporizing him. It shatters Earth's crust with the impact force of millions of thermonuclear explosions. The cloud it throws into the air blankets the entire world, killing all life. When the dust settles, Conor is little more than a fine powder scattered evenly over a cold and lifeless Earth.  Tough break.   COMING UP: CONOR VERSUS CONOR
