Me and Katie though, kinda aren’t talking and apparently she’s almost been cryin and shit. I keep receiving messages from other people about me and Katie. She’s telling her friends stuff like its all bad but pretending it’s good when she’s with me. We really need to talk I think and get everything out in the open. Laura was having a go at me today because I didn’t tell Katie I’d miss her on the phone the other day, cause Katie’s been telling her. I explained that I don’t like hints and all that and I think I got off. I’m guessing Laura’s probably passed this on to her so she’ll probably be hassling me tomorrow.  Anyway when we kissed at the end of lunch today I flung my leg into the air (just like any other fabulous woman) and ended up kicking heather’s bag which Laura thought was unbelievably funny, because it’s so feminine. Which I hope will get people thinking I’m gay. It’s really kind of annoying me at the moment the way that everyone treats me straight. I guess I do act straight when it comes to Katie. I need to act all ‘nice’ about her all lovy dovey to get people thinking of me as gay, but then they’ll just think I’m in love with Katie, god life’s confusing. Ok, so I have a couple of options. I can pretend to love her and leave her when we go to Ireland and forget all about it. With this option I risk having to be with her if I don’t go, she’ll get even more attached (if that’s possible) and I’ll have to put up being with her for a little longer (I’m not sure I can bear it). Or I can tell her I don’t love her. Leave her, maybe loose some new friends, disrespect from some people, but at lest I can get out of this hell hole now. Which one? I don’t know? The latter is best in the short run, the former is better in the long. I think. The short being max week and long being a few months. Not much difference so maybe I should stay with her. Try and get closer to keep everyone happy and forget when I move where I can start my new gay lifestyle. The thing is though I want to be gay now, with these friends and that can’t be done unless I break up. My ladie friends can’t possibly imagine I could be gay whilst I’m with Katie. I want the best of both worlds but I can’t have it. Right I’ll have to think about it. Anyway, I’ve realised something. I’m in love with arron. I realised it yesterday when at break he waved to me access the thingy and I waved back. Our eyes connected for a second and I felt someone small but powerful. I really think I love him. He’s so gorgeous. With arron it’s different. Unlike dean and Justin I don’t think about fucking, sucking or rubbing him I just want to lay with him in bed. Cuddle him and kiss him with my tounge. I figured I’d add some lite porn at this point. Spuce this journal up a little. That’s want I want with arron, two beautiful hunks of man to hold and kiss each other. Ok, so I’m off now to watch Frasier.
