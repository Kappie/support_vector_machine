I started to feel sick last night and I still got that feeling like something is comming on...I hope its nothing and just goes away. I cant really afford to miss work or school.  So this past week at work has been some what interesting. I walk thru the halls here all the time and it always seems like someone catches my eye or maybe I catch theres..The thing is Im always right in the middle of something so it would be kinda hard to 'holla holla' at one of these girls. I feel like crap today so I dont even really care to much to look at anything much less talk..but I'll get my chance here sooner or later. I swear some of these girls in here are just gorgeous..Im like what are you doing at a votech looking like that? Who knows. Think I'll go home after work today and curl up in my bed. later peoples.  tip- Seriously, if she's givin ya a handjob or BJ and attempts to give you the reacharound because cosmo said it will make your orgasm better, let her do it. Cosmo is right. And seriously, for all you guys that are insecure about your sexuality... a finger up your butt doesn't make you ***... unless that finger belongs to another guy.
