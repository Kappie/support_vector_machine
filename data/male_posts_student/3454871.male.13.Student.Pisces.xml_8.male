O well you know... can't push it. Then I went to first hour with the weird Thompson. Damn that woman has ugly clothes. Yesterday she was a candycane and today she was wearing flower capris. Sorry lady flower capris went out years ago. I'm sorry to say that you are stuck in the olden days. It's actually quite sad. So anyways we read out of the retarded book. UGH its so boring. I love escaping there for the joy of cooking. Today we got to eat. I also took my mom a slice of the pie. And amazingly the pie wasn't that bad. I mean... I don't like jelly but it was pretty good. But then it was off to boring math class. Well actually today it was pretty fun. We got to do more with the dot paper but it keeps getting harder. So I have to ask Mrs. Engels to help me with my homework. Fourth hour we had to watch the birth. The lady made the hottest faces in the world. O were they ever sexy. She also had a mullet... yep that's right a damn hott mullet. Man I wish I could be her. She was so sexy. At lunch I pretty much ate and flirted with Trent. O and can't forget about this. Trent and I stole Desire`'s crutches to see if she really was faking it. And she totally is. It's actually kind of sad that she had to fake an injury to get attention. Fifth hour I didn't sing again because of the cloggage in my throat. STUPID ALLERGIES. Class was actually quite boring. A lot less thrilling than study hall. I helped Mrs. Engels scan in pictures again. Katie went on a browse pass for Bernie so she helped Desire` and I do that. (I actually am getting annoyed with Desire` because she's a faker.) Katie and I just kept laughing for no reason. Well actually we were laughing because of some of the baby pictures but you know. Seventh hour we watched more of the boring movie. Documentarys need to like be burned or something. They aren't interesting at all. I almost fell asleep but I didn't. Thank god. Then eighth hour we watched another movie. This one was actually quite interesting though. It was about Blackhawk and this photographer guy who brought tourism to Wisconsin by taking pictures of the Dells. It was pretty cool. We also got grade reports. I'm getting a 100.2%. I got it back up in the hundreds. YAY. After school Katie came over until five fifteen-ish. We talked on the net, made popcorn, and watched T.V. As boring as that sounds it was kinda fun. After Katie went home we took Mitch to baseball practice, came home, ate tuna helper (that's right TUNA), went back and picked Mitch up. Then I came home, read my book, and played on the computer. O this is fun. Well I gotta go clean my bathroom. Such a joy huh? NOT!
