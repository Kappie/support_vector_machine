Those who work also get to play, and those who don't will get left out, so sad.  Anyway, we need Representatives for Classes VIII, X, XI and XII. The position of Representative for Class IX has already been filled. In addition, we will have two Representatives for Class VIII instead of one because they will also be incharge of Classes VI and VII.  The job of the Representatives is quite simple. We have posters, and they have to make sure that the Domain Square announcement is made in each section of their respective class.  Domain Square will take place over 6 days starting on Wednesday, 21 st  of July and ending Monday, 2 nd  of August. There will only be one round for each class. Each class from VI to XII will have its individual competition on one day each between 21 July and 2 August. There will be  one  winner from each Class. We will take between 16 and 20 people from each Class on a first come first serve basis.  Announcements will start tomorrow and posters will be posted. The Domain Square website is operational at   urlLink www.exunclan.com/d2  .  After each day of Gaming, Domain Square Reps will have their own LAN gaming party till 3:30 PM (time when buses leave). So hurry up and join as a Rep by posting your name in the comments. Discretion of choosing members for D[2] lies with me.  --Karan
