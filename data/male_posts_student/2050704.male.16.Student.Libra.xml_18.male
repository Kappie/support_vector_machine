A guy is in a really important golf tournament, the winner recieved 1 million dollars. So he's on the 8th hole and he has a 45 foot putt for par. He doesnt think he has a chance to make the putt until a little old man comes over. The old man says to him "if you are willing to give up 1/3 of your sex life, I guarantee you will make this putt." The man thinks about it for a second and then says "1/3? Thats no problem." Sure enough, the man hits the long putt to remain tied for second place. The man then comes to the 15th green and has a 30 foot putt for birdie, and the lead. He again thinks he will miss the putt until the same little old man comes over and says "for another 1/3 of your sex life, I guarantee you will make this putt." The man again thinks for a second and says "another 1/3, no problemo" and again sinks the putt to become tied for the lead. So finally the man is on the 18th green, and has a putt for birdie. If he sinks it he wins the tournament, and the 1 million dollars, but if he misses he loses the tournament. Once again, this little old man comes out of the forest and says "for the last 1/3 of your sex life, I guarantee you'll make the putt." The man doesnt even think this time and says "no problem, sex life, 1/3, gone, I want this win." Sure enough, the man makes the putt, and wins the 1 million dollars. The little old man then comes up to him and says "I just hope you know, you made a deal with the devil, because I am Satan and you no longer have a sex life, ahaha!" the man replies "well just so YOU know, i've been a priest for 15 years"
