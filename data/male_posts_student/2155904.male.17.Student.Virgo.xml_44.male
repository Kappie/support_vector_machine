You hold it like a camera more than you would a regular videocamera.  But it is digital and it gets the job done.  So he loves getting to make movies and, hopefully, his friends will actually be free tomorrow so he can make some movies with them.  He hasn't talked to anybody in quite some time.  And hopefully things went well for Skippy.  Tyke hasn't actually gotten to talk to Skippy about whatever happened but he is assuming it is good.  As long as Skippy is happy, that is good.  And today was fun for Tyke so, it was good.  This can hopefully be a good omen for things to come.  Maybe things will get better now and Tyke can have a fun last 100 days of high school.  The days are ticking by quickly.  Graduation is not far off.  And college too will be on everybody sooner than they can believe.  People will split and drift and some others will get closer.  But most importantly, Tyke will get to meet some fine new ladies.  There is nothing more important than that (SOOOOO JOKING!)  Short but sweet tonight.  Not enough to blog about for now.  To the Gods!  (Adios!)
