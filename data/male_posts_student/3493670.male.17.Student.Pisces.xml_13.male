You need it in order to finish your thesis. If you'd keep worrying about us, you'll never finish your thesis on time. This can't always be about us. This is now about you. The "ME" time you deserve. Quit worrying about me and people around you because that will never solve your thesis problems.  I can't speak for everybody. I can only speak for myself. First and foremost, I know how important your thesis is to you. So I am giving you the time and please take it without the slightest tinge of guilt. Be comforted by the fact that I understand it and yes, I'm giving it to you. you have my full support and you don't have to worry about anything ^_^
