He has hired me to babysit the house/dog/cats while they are gone. I'm sure the next five days will be filled with fun and exitement.  Yah. Damn near all of my friends are more allergic to cats than I am, and my dad has TWO. So that's the end of that plan.  I think I may get a job in the month of august, mostly because I may NEED it to help pay for my braces. My family is in dire straits right now, what with the breakup and all, and money will be very tight. Very.  Any hopes of leaving town this summer for a vacation have been shattered.  On the plus side, I just had a soothing bubble bath, I'm about to read the IKEA catelogue, then I'm going to watch White Oleander, and there's nothing you homophobes can do about it!!!   Lets talk a little bit about my father and I.  Since around age fifteen, my father has had a drinking problem. Alcohol ran his life. It was only after his wife (my mother) left him, and when he had the gun literally pointed at his head was he saved.  He had lost everything and was about to end it all, when my grandmother called him on the phone, and told him he should go to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. From that day on he has never once picked up a drink. He was saved.  I thank him for being who he is. Although I only get to see him every other weekend, I thank him for making me who I am. If HE hadn't started going to meetings, I wouldn't have been able to go with him. I've been in the program for sixteen years, I've seen the mistakes he has made, and I have seen the mistakes countless others have made, and as a result, I will not make those same mistakes. Because of my father, I will never drink, I will never do drugs, I will never get myself into any of the awful things he was in.  He made every mistake in life so that I don't have to. He couldn't be a better father than he is right now.  Ciao for now.
