It is my momentary leap into youth even if it is past broken glasses and broken dreams of a city that once was proud and courageous. In its people I see sadness and tears deep in their wells of thoughts. Each building cutting into the sky is a reminder of the dreams that never reached their destination. But for the moment that I am on my bike I look at the world through a child's eye and bid hello to every stranger. It is my small attempt while I am a child to make a difference--to let people know that they are not alone with a friendly hello and a warm smile. My bike journey must end and the reminder of what is left of Detroit comes back quickly. The broken glass, the littered nightmares, and smeared graffiti all paint a landscape that is hard to bear. Every time I stare at this artwork, I am propelled to ride my bike once again and live that dream of a child's life even for a moment....
