Sports to Frank Robinson and John Kruk at ESPN.com, I'm fairly annoyed by the whole bunch of them.  I suppose I'm off the mark in wanting better, more interesting articles, instead of platitude and clich√©-ridden fluff pieces.  Most of the time, I can ignore them and go about my daily life.  Occasionally, something strikes me as ridiculously funny.  John Kruk's new article, which you can find  urlLink here , talks about the slowest runners in the majors right now.  Of course, over 10 years in the pros, Kruk stole 58 bases and was caught 31 times (career stats  urlLink here ).  This gives him almost identical career stats to that other famous base-stealer,  urlLink James Edward Rice .  The difference being that Baseball-Reference.com compares Rice favorably to such Hall of Famers as Duke Snider, Orlando Cepeda, Willie Mays (this one surprised me, but I guess from a power standpoint it's not that far off), Billie Williams, and Willie Stargell.  Kruk, on the other hand, compares favorably with Rusty Greer, Mike Easler, Troy O'Leary, Darrin Erstad, and Hal McRae.  I guess you write what you know.   Update : To be fair, Kruk's dead on about Malone laying out Darrick Martin.  Just as Dr. Z was right about Sapp's hit on Clifton a couple years ago.  Not quite the same thing, but I'm still pretty annoyed about that last one, okay?
