FULL PAYMENT OF $19.95 BY 05/20/04 WILL PREVENT FURTHER COLLECTION ACTIVITY. PAY VIA CREDIT CARD OR SIMPLY MAIL YOUR CHECK IN THE ENCLOSED ENVELOPE.  Great. Only one problem: I DIDN'T SUBSCRIBE TO THE MAGAZINE, YOU STUPID IDIOTS! Unless I subscribed to the magazine in my sleep, or I filled out something on the internet that automatically subscribed me, then I have no recollection of ever doing so. When I received the first bill for this several months ago, I asked my dad if I should just cancel it or email them, but he said "No, I'll take care of it." Now I am at risk of having a collection agency on me. How can I have bad credit at my age? I don't have a credit card or even a checking account for that matter.
