Ow!!  Tyke just bit his cheek with two of his canine teeth in the exact same place as he did earlier today.  All because of the super delectible cookie he was eating.  Today was a productive day for Tyke.  He got up a little bit before noon and decided he would do some good stuff around the house.  First he got the vacuum from upstairs and went at his downstairs floor with it.  He did a bang up job on it and vacuumed all he felt like doing.  Then he took the mats from his bathroom and vacuumed them.  Then he washed the floor of his bathroom and cleaned everything else up.  Tyke worked up a nice little sweat from all of his manual labor he forced himself to do.  Afterwards he got some stuff for his mom cuz she was sick but spent much of the day just lounging around the house and working out.  He worked out much more later on that night.  Tyke's dad went to the Mariners game and since his mom was sick Tyke went to Taco Time and got dinner for himself and his mom.  He also dropped by Blockbuster to drop something off and look for a game but he didn't see what he wanted.  So he came home and chowed down on his burrito.  The burrito had part of the soft crust a little crispy so he thought that he could just tear it off.  But so much of it was crispy that he ended up tearing the burrito basically in half and all of the meat spilled out.  So then he tried to eat it with a fork and dipping it into the hot sauce was a real struggle.  It ended up all going to where it needs to go (Tyke's stomach) but some of it took the long way there, by going onto the table and then onto a fork.  By the time Tyke actually finished the burrito he was hardly hungry enough, or in the mood to, eat the rest of his Mexi-fries so he forfeited them.  Kinker came over at about 7 and then was joined by Amed and later Macaroon.  They busted Risk out again and this time they had a draft for the countries.  Tyke took all of Australia as well as much of the Far East.  He ended up having a hell of a time trying to control Asia though and ended up deciding to retreat and just hold onto his Australian lands.  But then came a shift in the game.  Kinker had the brilliant idea to team up and take Macaroon out of the game because he would be getting quite a few armies on the next turn.  So they all ganged up on him and fairly and quickly took him out of the game.  All because he decided to spare Amed's one last country on his previous turn, Amed got to go back and take out a lot of Macaroon.  It was quite fun for all involved.  All.  After Risk they played Trivial Pursuit.  They showcased their limited knowledge of life but Tyke did end up winning.  Cuz he is the best.  And now it is all over.  Tomorrow Tyke is going to Refuge and is going out to dinner with his family.  Either that or his mom isn't cooking.  They might not go out though cuz she is sick.  But, it will all be up to her.  Tyke listened to some good music tonight.  Bob Seger and the BeeGees rule.  Will you.
