Indeed, were we to place a microscope or deforming lense between an object  our eyes, the object will suffer no change, but it's image cast on our retina would, of course be modified. As a result, our judgement of it's shape and size would vary. Hence when we decide unhesitatingly that a coin is round, the only inference to be drawn is that the coin's image on our retina is judged by our brain to be circular.
