I remember the very first day I heard the word. Pati took me to register for primary one. We got off at the ACJC bus stop and walked all the way to the primary school. There's so many things I remember. Oh God, it's overwhelming.  I cried yesterday. When we did worship. When my choir sang. When we sang the school song and when we sang bless this school. God bless Farifield. I may be leaving it's gates just as I did after the O'levels, but Mrs Tang, and I'm sure her predicessors have said, "Once a Fairsian, Always a Fairsian". I will take solace in that. I was proud to be a Fairsian. Proud.  Today was it. The last time the 2003 batch would ever be together again. The founders day dinner. Everyone who came, came dressed up. It was good to see everyone happy. That's what gives me peace. We had some sort of a dinner today. I paid $60 but I couldn't have eaten more than $6 worth of food. The rest of the time was spent wandering about watching people smile and pose for photos. I took snapshots of them in my mind. It's a real pity that my family doesn't have a solid video camera or a good camera for that matter. I will just have to sourse for photographs then.  We "worked" with Leon on eating baby Octopuses.. octopusses.. octopi? He was, well... apprehensive.  Throughout the night, we watched pictures and memories projected on a wall. They did not evoke much, but we did take an N*Chink photograph. That was good! I miss my 2C. Someday I will tell you about 2C. We did many things and if only we could get together to reminisce. That would be wonderful. I will set it up.  The band consisted of Jireh, Pow Wee, Chris Ong, Eu Liang, Samuel, Leon and I. We practiced twice before this. We're all pretty good at what we do. God was with us. On monday, I'd fallen ill with the flu. Though the sniffles were clearing up, there was another problem. A singers worst nightmare. Soar throat during the period of the gig. I was careful. Drank a gallon of magic juice and took plenty of losenges. It still wasn't better. Today was quite the rush. Fun rush. Dad picked me up at home. We went to pick Cheam up. We couldn't find Cheam. We turned around to scour the roadsides. Cheam called us and we picked him and his sax up after that. We went to Eu Liang's school to pick him and his piano up. We were en route to Leon's when I remembered that I'd left the mikes behind. My father's language was interesting and my friends were amused. We decided to come back for the mikes later. On the way to Leon's we picked Pow Wee, his amplifier and guitar up. Then we paid the chouffer for the night's revels. Picked Leon up, went to Reiner's and broke in. Now I know how to break in to Reiner's place. Took the drumset and sent the boys in a cab to Pan Pac. Jireh and Chris were instructed to do the same. Leon, I and Daddy went back to get the mikes afterwhich we headed to Pan Pac. Oh boy... That was tiring.  The music, when performed thrilled the noisy croud. I asked Zhu to help back me for "This love's" chorus. Other than that, I held it alone with the boys. Heaven was good too but the best song, without a doubt, was Friends. I sang it. The whole cohort stood, arms around each other and swayed. Teachers cried and friends cried. I cried watching them. I think my voice wavered once or twice because of emotion. There was such meaning in the song that I was one with it and I spoke through me. It was the language of emotion. I don't think I've ever done anything quite like it. I've performed more times than i can count now, but this one was special. I was not exceptionally prepared. I had the lyrics on the floor. I can't explain it. It's like, you cry because it fills you and you feel the beauty and meaning of the music. I dare say, it was the most powerful performance I've ever given.  There is so much I cannot even begin to express it. No, I can express it.   Fairfield
