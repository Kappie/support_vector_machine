Read inside. Talked on the phone. Ate food. Took a nap. Watched TV. Played Gamecube. See? Not that much. I was really bored today for the most part. I got my report card for summer school. Now, I only took Driver's ED, but it didn't say that I got any credits for it, and it must have been a pass or fail class (I passed, of course). Other than that, I did just about nothing. Well, that's it for today. Goodnight everyone! I just have one question; Why don't they call 7-11 just plain old 18? It's the same thing...isn't it?
