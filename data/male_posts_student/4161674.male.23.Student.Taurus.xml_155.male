As children we’re often afraid of imaginary things that our unlimited creativity seems to spout out without much effort. As adults, we are often more afraid of tangible or realistic things. Things like our kids getting sick, not being able to pay the bills or being rejected by the people we care about. If I give you a minute, I’ll bet you can come up with something you were afraid of when you were little and something you’re afraid of now. As you compare the two things you fear, they may seem to be very unrelated – but the emotional reaction is the same. Fear paralyzes you.  During his years as premier of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev denounced many of the policies and atrocities of Joseph Stalin. Once, as he censured Stalin in a public meeting, Khrushchev was interrupted by a shout from a heckler in the audience. "You were one of Stalin's colleagues. Why didn't you stop him?" "Who said that?" roared Khrushchev. An agonizing silence followed as nobody in the room dared move a muscle. Everyone was paralyzed with fear.  Then Khrushchev replied quietly, "Now you know why."   Although Khrushchev demonstrated the fear Stalin was able to exude over himself and the Soviet people, Stalin wasn’t free from fear himself.  It is said that the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin so feared for his safety that his residence in Moscow contained eight bedrooms. Each night Stalin chose a bedroom at random to ensure that no one knew exactly where he was sleeping.  Stalin feared for his safety and lost much sleep over ways to keep himself safe.  Khrushchev was afraid of what Stalin could do, until he was removed from power. Fear is something that we all have to face at some point in our lives. If you don’t take a moment to consider how you deal with your fear, you may find yourself frozen by its power to paralyze.  Jesus and his disciples spent a great deal of their time traveling about and ministering to the masses of people that were sick and hurting. It can be easy to assume that the disciples were always filled with peace and solitude because they spent so much time with Jesus. The disciples struggled with fear and discouragement regularly, even though they lived and worked with Jesus for about three years. Matthew 14:22-33, shows us how much the disciples needed Jesus’ help to live life without being paralyzed by fear.   Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, but the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.   During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.  When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a ghost," they said, and cried out in fear.   But Jesus immediately said to them: "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."   "Lord, if it's you," Peter replied, "tell me to come to you on the water."   "Come," he said.   Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, "Lord, save me!"   Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"   And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.  Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."    The disciples felt like they were alone – possibly abandoned. Even though they were experienced fishermen, the rough water and wind frightened them.  Jesus knew where they were. Jesus went looking for them. He knew they would be scared. Jesus called out to them to comfort them.  The disciples thought Jesus was a ghost because they were so unsettled. Peter was upset, but he didn’t allow his fear to paralyze him. Peter got out of the boat, but when he saw the danger around him he panicked. Peter started to sink. He called for help.  Jesus immediately pulled him out of the water, climbed into the boat with the disciples, and the wind stopped.   The disciples worshiped Jesus after seeing his ability to care for them and protect them.  Jesus words and actions throughout this stormy night provided a great deal of comfort to his disciples. I think that these same words can provide us with the same comfort we all need when the concerns and worries of our lives are about to paralyze us.   During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.   It can be hard to understand, but the fact remains that Jesus knows where we are and is looking for ways to get our attention. He understands the difficulties we’re facing more than we do. It is His desire to find us where we are, so he can take us to safety.   But Jesus immediately said to them: "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."   Jesus words were heard through the wind and the waves. Peter remembered enough about what Jesus had taught him to respond to his voice. Remembering God, holding on to courage and letting go of fear is the only way we are every going to get out of the boat.   "Come," he said.   Sometimes a fearful situation requires us to move out of our comfort zone. Just as Jesus called Peter out of the boat – he calls us out. If we keep moving toward God, we will move farther away from fear.   Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?" And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.   To be honest, I don’t think that Jesus was surprised that Peter panicked once he left the safety of the boat. Jesus understands how frightening it is to step into situations that are unsure. That’s why he had his hand out waiting for Peter. Jesus didn’t wait to see if Peter could swim, he was ready and prepared to rescue him. I think that Jesus would have liked to see more faith in the reactions of the disciples, instead of asking them about their doubts. But just as he asked them why they had doubted, he calmed the winds. Jesus understands the need we all have for peace and clarity. Just like a child can’t learn their alphabet on a hungry stomach, we can’t accept that peace exists when there is a storm raging around or inside of us.  So what storm is raging in your life today? Fear, anxiety, and hurt can cause us to forget the peace and comfort Jesus offers just like the disciples did. We can begin to forget the sound of his voice, or just not be able to hear over the raging storm around us. So just as Peter called out into the storm, you can to. Don’t stay in a boat that’s being tossed about in the chaos of life. Come out and meet Jesus on the water. Although your faith may be small, he can calm the storm and take you to safety. Jesus can be your bridge over troubled water. Inside and out.
