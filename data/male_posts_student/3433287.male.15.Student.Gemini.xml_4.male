Ive concitered taking a part in the world of Psycology and be a Psychatrist (maybe i should learn to spell it first...) and im really leaning towards that right now.  I figured if all else fails i can be a corrupted cop...  yeah, the corrupted cop who blows things up, knows martial arts and is a master sword fighter...oh yeah, and likes music:O  but then agian, i always thought about being a good cop...damn, so many fall back careers...i want to either be a Criminal Justice Major...or a Psycatrist...what do you think?
