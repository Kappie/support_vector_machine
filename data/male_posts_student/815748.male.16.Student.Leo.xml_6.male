He stole the idea of a blog from me, but I stole this idea from him:  Here's my list of classes, organized like so: Name�Semesters Taught�First Period Each Week (who else I am reasonably sure is in it). See if you're in any of them, and let me know if you aren't already listed.  Freshman Core P E�1�G2 (Matt) Freshman Core P E�2�B2 (Loren) Sexuality and Health�2�B1 (no one I know) English 9 I�1/2�C1 (Loren) Speech�1�B1 (Dan Waldinger) French 2 I�1/2�A1 (Richie, John Garabedian, Ian, Josh Magid) World History 300-1815 I�1/2�D1 (Loren) Mock Trials�1/2�M5 (no one I know) Model U.N.�2�M5 (Matt) Honors Math 1�1/2�F1 (Richie) Intro Physics Lab�1/2�E1 (Alex Turner, Simon)  I'm in homeroom 210A, also.
