SO instead of doing this now i did a home expiremnt by trying to see the letter's at a distance with how  they test you with the letter's with different sizes. so in the end i came up with I NEED GLASSES i realized this a while ago and pushed it a side. While on the subject of expirents I've done a couple now, such as i accidentally magnetised my earphones i don't know how exactly,also i have MAgically fixed The print gear studio software. now that i think about i my self have not on purpose done any of this things ony accidentally, well that's one big bummer. hehe anyway u actually am experimenting with myself im kind of tired of the image im projecting, such as bleached hair for all i lkeit it's loosing it's once magnetic attraction, and i don't feel like wasting $12.00 on hair dye im actually going to do one of the following  A) do more experimenting with bleach ive learned a couple of tricks to make bleach come out a light reddish color or B) go to Fiesta and buy japanesse$5.00 hair dye.
