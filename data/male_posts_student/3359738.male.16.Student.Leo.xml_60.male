I quote:    The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) and the Optometrists Association Australia warned that directly viewing the sun for the event placed observers at risk of having a hole burnt in the retina, which could lead to permanent blindness.      Remember you can always grab your digital camera and watch the eclipse by looking at the LCD. I hear there'll be also live webcasts of the transit.
