The fact is, that if Lisa (woman that's been making my work a living hell of neverending drama for the past weekend) had seen me talking to ANYBODY, and not doing anything for all of 4 seconds, she would have barked off a command of some kind.  I mean, Jesus.  She was giving me somewhere around 2 seconds to bag one order, and then scramble past 4 empty lanes and bag a can of soup somebody bought. So BAG YOUR OWN CAN OF SOUP, YOU PREMIE TRICK ASS CHEESE WHORE! Bam!
