Anyway, I liked the promo-song. *cough*gundamseedripoff*cough*  So, Midsummer's over (swedish-special-day-thingie), and I'm back home. It's really warm outside, but luckliy, I've got my basement. :) The mIRC-X site was changed a couple of weeks back, and now you can find it at:  urlLink MIRKX.com .
