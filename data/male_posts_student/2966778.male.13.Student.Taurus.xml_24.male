Take that all you people who didn't pay attention to me today when you were sucked into Yhaoo!'s Matrix-equivalent world of mindless idiots who pay $20 a year just for 2GB.  Who needs 2GB for twenty bucks.  You're  never  gonna need 'em.  1GB is enough.  Don't blame me when I get the ladies for having invitations to GMail!  Losers!  Yodellers always looked stupid to me!  One yodelling dude almost made this kid lose his genitalia with a broomstick.  I saw it with my very eyes!  Later.
