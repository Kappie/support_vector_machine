It is amazing how everything changes in the short time That she walks into my life right through that door.  She makes your jaw hit the floor as she walks past She is a winner in all ways - point, game, and set You wonder her name but soon enough you will find out She leaves one an impression that you won't soon forget.  Her countenance is pleasant?  I'd say it's beautiful. Those eyes, that smile, that hair - what else can I say? She is smart and beautiful - you almost can't describe She will forever be able to take my breath away.   OK... A little bit more now... I'm going to keep working on this one and see how much I can come up with so more to come. Comment if you want....
