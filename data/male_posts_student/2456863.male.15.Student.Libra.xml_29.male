I think reid is feeling better about his slip up and ensuing depression, I donno if he figured out that my sn and short, "the one with penitence makes the best of companions" was talking about him but i hope so.  It really means that, if you feel sorry for something you did, you can't be a bad person.  And thea is doing better it seems as well.  I still wish she'd explain the pills and cough syrup but oh well.  It's good to not like anybody... its been so long since i could say that... to be free... you just dont understand it i guess until... hey wait thats another short: "Experience is the best communicator."  Anyway, gnight.
