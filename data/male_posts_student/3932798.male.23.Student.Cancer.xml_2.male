We never stay broken up for too long but I am almost wishing that this one will stay permanent. I am tired of being hurt....    Well, I guess you would like to know what happened. She came back this weekend from Laramie where she is going to summer school. I planned a nice day today to go to the Natural Bridge Park. We had fun walking around and talking. She held my hand and everything on the drive there and back. However, I could just tell that something was bothering her. It took her until tonight to tell me what.    Well, this is how it went...HER: "I just don't know what to do." ME: "Why because you like Kyle (her ex-boyfriend she has been hanging out with)?" HER:"Yes"    Now, this freaking thing seems to happen every year. This is now like the sixth time this has happened in the four and a half years that we have been going out. Granted that she says that she hasn't done anything with the guy this time but the other times she had. I don't know what is worse: having the girl you think you love with all your heart do this to you, breaking up with the girl you thought you would someday marry, or actually being so used to these things happening that I don't have an emotional reaction to it.    I do feel very very upset and hurt...but did I cry...no....did I get mad at her and yell...no...what did I do...just sat there trying to think of what I want to do. Maybe we should break up because I can't stop her from doing this over and over again and I can't stop her from feeling jealous because I talk to other people. Why don't girls love me and stay with me? Why can't I have someone who will love me and never cheat on me? I have never ever cheated on one of my girlfriends. I have had some opportunities but I have never put myself in those situations that anything might happen from them. Why can't I expect the same?   This sucks!!!! I have no idea what to do now.
