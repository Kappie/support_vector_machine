All this funniness at once is kind of frightening... :-D  Like, at TGC today, we were playing Jedi Knight(don't stop reading, it gets stupider), to mess with me, Todd made his name "jesse=one_testicle" Now, this isn't true, and it made me fall over laughing, and then i went up to hit him, and then he hit me... not hard, just to the point where we both almost fell on the floor laughing, i'm still laughing about it as I write this...  Then, i went to www.threebrain.com (they made Gonads and Strife! wweeeeee!), and they have this new comic called Texties, where the 2 characters are smiley faces turned sideways in text, I'll post it here. For legal reasons, please know that this is NOT mine, it is totally threebrain's thing.     I just saw it and it made me laugh so much.... im still laughing, again. 2 times the laughter! It's like watching conan o'brien and south park at the same time!!!
