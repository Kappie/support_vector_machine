Which means, you really can't tell if they like you, because they do things that you just wouldn't expect. Which also could lead to two things: They like fucking with your mind or They really do like you. But if they did like you they probably wouldn't tell you. Girls do this hinting but not saying thing. You all know what I'm talking about. And it's so frustrating being infatuated with someone and not being able to figure anything out because everytime you communicate with them it's all small talk. You don't really learn anything about each other because you proabably talk about world events or your parents. Sharing your horrible childhood doesn't really turn anyone on either. Making people trying to feel sorry for you won't help anything. IT will just make them look down at you.   Don't fuck around with your feelings. Don't spill them to anyone. NO. Your online journal isn't the place. You want privacy.  Privacy? Privacy is hard to find. I don't keep a private journal...because I know its not really private. I know my mom goes through my room.  But anyways yeah...life is horrible. Fuck you ladies. I am so sick and tired of chasing after you. What's the point? You women just tie me down. I want to be free. So suck my balls ladies. Suck my balls.   and get out of my life.  Diversity...people say everyone is the same...and equal. Equal in what sense? Nobody is the same. If we were we'd all have the same finger prints, the KKK would be the Kool Kids Klub, and Hitler would have been a successful painter. I am not a minority. Fuck you.   I would normally say goodnight but theres nothing good about it.  I have more to talk about but I will continue in the morning.  Until then, au resevoir.....cunts.
