It was weird, because I was watching myself look at all the people there (which was odd, because I know there wouldn't be a lot of people in actuality) and I could see them crying, but I could tell that the version of myself that I was looking at didn't feel anything. Does that mean anything? Am I going to die alone and jaded? God, I hope not.  I'm sure everyone thinks at some point how they'd like to die. I know I do. I read somewhere of this 87 year-old who died while dancing. I think I'd like that. Just going along, without a care in the world, then just letting go. I know for a fact that I don't want to drown, burn to death, or die slowly in any way. Like cancer. Cancer would suck.   Anyway, I just thought I 'd share this with you all in the hopes that I'll find out what it means sooner or later.    Talk to you later! *hugs!*
