Every day on the site, you can see different things in each of the several subjects that the site covers, including movies, tech, videogames, sports, girls, and much more.  Every section is filled with some of the most quality content that I have ever seen in a website of this magnatude.  Currently, my favorite feature on the website is the interview with the people that created the special effects for Spiderman 2.  They do such a good job with it, and it's definitely one of the better sites out there.  The layout for UGO.com is very graphic, and it looks great.  It's not as good, as say, 1up.com, but, it's still a very nice looking website.  It is very easy to navigate through the site, and it runs pretty fast, as well.   urlLink    UGO is the place to go for practically anything. Games, Film, TV, DVD, Music, Tech, Sports, Comics, Girls, and Video! urlLink     So, overall, UGO is a great site, it gets a high recommendation from me.  Check it out, at www.ugo.com.    Pros  +Nice design +Great Content +Lots of different sections   Cons  -I can't think of any!    Score  Fun Factor: 100%-A Graphics/Layout: 95%-A Speed: 100%-A Content: 100%-A Final: 98.75%-A GOLD! ------------------------------- Daily Wrap Up  Hope you liked the first day of Digital Lust, the new name for bagel.tech.  We're looking at more stuff than ever before, and the content that you see here is only going to get better.  Here's what we looked at today:  Today's tip of the day was how you can change blogs.  If you're wanting to combine two blogs, you're going to have to copy and paste each post to your new blog from your old blog, and you can make them post at the same time that the original post was, by selecting "More Post Options," and changing the date and time to the same as the old post.  Today's download was Atom Films Hi-Def.  This service is free, and lets you download your favorite Atom Films in gloriful Hi Definition.  This download received a 96.25, and is a high recommendation.  If you are a fan of Atom Films, check this one out, because you can't go wrong with it.  Today's video, which was a new feature, was the newest edition of Strong Bad Email, which is called Cheatday, on HomeStarRunner.com.  This one isn't the best Strong Bad Email that I've watched, but it is still as good as any other one.    Today's site of the day, seen above, is UGO.com.  This is almost a perfect site, which would have made it the first 100% that I would have given in the new rating system.  Everything is easy to navigate on the site.  UGO.com received a 98.75%.    And that's it for Digital Lust today.  Be sure to check out Blog of Bagel tonight for some Late Night Bloggin', a brand new eBay Hunter, and what's going on in my life today.  Here's the tentative schedule for tomorrow:  GAME Impressions: Spiderman 2: The Game.  I'm going to be giving a preliminary review of Spiderman 2: The Game, for the Xbox.  I've beaten it, and it's a great game, and now, my preliminary review.  DOWNLOAD: Adobe Acrobat  TIP: Finding a guestbook for Blogger  SITE: To Be Announced.  We'll see you tomorrow here on Digital Lust.
