Jonahs new title scheme should be things that sound like attacks from animes! You know, in those action sequence thingies when They say the name of the attack?Like Hipster Flare. (Its a kind of pants that lara has and I thought it sounded like sumthin from digimon)  Whats the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?
