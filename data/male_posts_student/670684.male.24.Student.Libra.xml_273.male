I had so many great things to say...as I watched the fireworks from Ernie Shore Field after watching the first live no-hitter of my life, I knew it was going to be a damn good night of blogging.  And I played games with the kids, read them a story (an impromptu bit about Mary and her lamb that she turns into lunch meat after Old Man McGregor tries to sodomize it), and had a staff meeting...but work called, and the gusto was quelled through the mindless pasting of construction paper, taping of bags to walls, and rearranging of furniture.  Everyone's been in bed for hours.  They'll appriciate this in the morning.  I will appriciate bed.
