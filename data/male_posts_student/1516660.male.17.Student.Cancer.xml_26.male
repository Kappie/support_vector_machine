     
       Love,  a word of trust and hope that binds two souls as one  Love, a word misused, misplaced tears apart a person from within  It turns you inside out with the rawest emotions  of the soul within   It twists and turns  and blows you away  and out of sight  But yet, nothing pleases more than a lover's smile on you or the other   Ironies of life yet truth of love makes one happy to see the other so
