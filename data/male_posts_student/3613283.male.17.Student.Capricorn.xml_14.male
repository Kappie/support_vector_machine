Please read these painful comments:  Kate Garaufis complained: "Well, I remember,  like , one of the things that was just  like  most difficult to accept for me was seeing the  like  T-shirts that said  like ,  like  ‘bomb them’ or  like  ‘kill the,’  like  I don’t know, all this  like  hate speech that  like  seemed really just unnecessary in such  like  a difficult time for everyone."  So please, if anyone can like tell me like why like teenagers do that, it would be like cool.   urlLink Media Research Center.
