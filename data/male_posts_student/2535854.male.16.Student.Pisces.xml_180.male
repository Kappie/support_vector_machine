Well lets skip through what happened at school until Chemistry.So Mrs. Kalai was teaching us how to use the instruments and stuff for experiments!Woohoo!Looks like fun doing but must be careful and not do anything *too* stupid if I do an experiment in front of class :p.Well anyway The Chem Peka is soon I belive now...noooo!!!!That will mean..more..work!!!!Yikes!!!!  So tuition had only 6 ppl today since Ju Ean overslept and didnt come..which left me and GB sitting together at the back...and she thinks ive got something on with Alia after she went through my phone but its not true!Just cause was suppose to meet her for a drink!Hehehe!and I was teasing her about Shaun.Heh.Its obvious theres something between them.They go all over school together!Anyway Pelarasan is now over..yikes..I hate that chapter..so god dman awful..  So turns out Alia wanted to meet at BSC but I told her that I`m not gonna go cause its already like 6pm and stuff..how long am I gonna stay?30 minutes and spend err...5-10bucks on taxi payments?No way Jose!Sigh.If only she could come to Bangsar Baru instead.  So grabbed Swedish Berries at Coffee Bean.Iced Tea.Its not bad.Finally tasting it after ages of temptation.Was thinking highly of Vanilla and whatever stuff is with it.Well its not sweetened unsurprisingly,so 4 packets (!!!!!) Of sugar finaly did some job and made it more decently nice!Reddish even.Smells like Berries.What do you expect you idiot?  Well I now have this unhealthy craving for Prodigy.Specially Mindfields and Narayan.  well the tea is keeping me awake now.from maybe 10pm-midnight,I was lying down on my bed or sleeping on and off and leaving my radio on and the laptop volume of high so could wake uyp if some1 messaged me.Although sadly no one did I was glad so...can sleep..oh yeah..hehe...  anyway this tea is keeping me crazy.I dunno my plans for tommorow.I think i`ll leave to go find some kind of substance or tasty food to eat away at.Catch you guys later.  Oh yeah I watched a replay or a repeat of Real Madrid beating Barcelona 2-1 and winning at the Camp Nou for the first time in 20 years.To bad Overmars could be as consistent as he was in that game...The match was really close...Real Madrid owe alot to Iker Casillas.The players were celebrating like they won a cup final!Joan Laporta was absolutely stunned!
