Frank and I were talking about how fun it would be to have that kind of competition with another nation... where every American triumph feels like a personal victory.  Aside from the brief period of time after 9/11, I don't think I've ever felt the sort of American comradery and patriotism that appeared in The Right stuff.  The homage paid to the test pilot was a little time consuming, but touching to see Yager continue to risk his life because it was his job and what he liked to do even if it were overshadowed by the space race.  Lastly, seeing Jeff Goldblum, Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, the crazy guy from Vertical Limit, and the hick in Tremors  as such young guys was also fun.  I hope that the extra credit incentive for posting tonight begins a trend on this blog.  Also, respond to the posts Tom and I wrote earlier.  Love Rob  P.S.  Thanks for the excelent review this afternoon, Clark
