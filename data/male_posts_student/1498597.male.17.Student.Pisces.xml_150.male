Actaully, I was thinkin' about the  Three Eye Witnesses  and how  Nick and I  have been strugglin' to make renovations and whatnot on it.  I also thought of  Eddie , who made a few suggestions on how to make the  P.R.E.  better.  So I decided to start thinkin' up ideas on how to improve the site and make it really kick ass.  I have some ideas, which I will present to you now.  I have proudly entitled this site renovation project  "Operation:  Revolution"   (1)   Meetin' the status quo...te!   Yeah, I definitely got this idea from the  T.E.W. .  If yer not familiar with it though....well, its somethin' like a brand new fuckin' quote every week, or somethin'.  It would be pretty cool huh?  Of course, I'm not gonna get rid of the  "site slogan" , as I like to call it, which is:   "Before you criticize someone, walk a mile in their shoes...that way, when you criticize them, yer a mile away and you have their shoes!" .  Anyway, here's how it works...quotes will be searched for in various places.  I find one I like, I put it at the top of the site, along with the person who said the damn thing.  Yeah, readers' quotes are welcome...so send 'em in.  (2)   Just for you, a book review!   Yeah, thats right.  I read books.  Wicked, eh?  No doubt inspired by  Nick and Eddie , and even more surprisingly, the recent  Author's Project , I decided that I wanna try and expose the world to interestin' literature.  Here's what to expect.  It'll be sorta like an overview of the book, what its about, who its written by, the title...you know.  I will still havta work on this idea though, so yeah...  (3)   Sounds like... This is an idea presented by  Eddie .  Similar to the book review, this will be a CD review on any recent CD's that happen to fall into my possession (I won't say how...)  Be warned though, I only listen to punk, hardcore, and ska...and some 80's too, so yeah...those will be the genres of music that I'll be reviewin' and whatnot.  Also, info on the band's tour dates (maybe)...I guess we'll just havta wait and see.  Well, those are the main ideas I guess.  Of course, I won't stray from bringin' up contoversial topics and stuff.  I have been browsin' online and lookin' through the local paper in search for blog-worthy topics.  I dunno if or when these changes will come in effect though.  Of course, suggestions are welcome from everyone (thats you guys), so yeah.  I want this to be for the people, by the people...course it'll be typed by me...so I get all the credit!  Just kiddin'!  Anyway keep readin'!  More to come...!
