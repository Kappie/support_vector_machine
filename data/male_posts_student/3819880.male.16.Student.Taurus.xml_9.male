I also have nothing to write about, I just created this because I was bored.    I saw Spider-man 2 tonight with Alexa, which was quite fun.  We tried to find other people to come with us to ease the assumed akwardness (which there was none of), but it turns out that people do things on Thursday nights, so we went to see it as just the two of us.  The movie was good, an enjoyable experience as a whole, and in the end my Thursday night was well spent.    And just a note to anyone who wants to park at Old Orchard on a busy night: Don't even bother looking for a space.  Just park on the roof of the lot and be done with it.  Besides, chances are you could use the exercise.    I got a haircut!  My hair is now short.  Like, normal-guy-haircut short.  I miss being able to run my hands through my hair, but on the other hand I do not have a psuedo-fro type thing going on now.  (Which is a good thing).    I don't know if anyone I know is going to be finding this, but just incase someone does I probably won't be posting too much personal information in this thing.    This was only an opening entry, hopefully things will get more interesting in the next few ones.  I'm not making any promises though, you'll just have to hope/pray/make virgin sacrifices to a shamanistic diety.  - Brian
