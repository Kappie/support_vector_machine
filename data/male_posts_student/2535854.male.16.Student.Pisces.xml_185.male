I think my back needs a bit more rest.  My vaccum is busted. Dang nab-bit. Bloody hell.  Good lord i`m hungry. I think i`ll go eat but wait..a little something to say first...  Me, Zainul, Divyesh, Hoong Zhang and Shahril are likely gonna be forming a band to play at Talent-Time. Wont be giving any details yet on what we could be performing as we haven`t gone for any jamming sessions yet. We should be jamming soon during the upcoming holidays or even as soon as the exams which are next week ;'(  end. It seems though that our choice of song to play is made up but we still need to see. I`m not saying anything though. Its gonna be a surprise here... but talk to me and i`ll liekly say it and whatever. Haha.  According to Shahril, it would be adviceable to play something not to heavy since the judge`s liekly wont like it very much. Likely something easy to play and something thats popular and will be liked by the audience although if we perform whatever horrendously, the audience wont love us obviously!  NOW. I shall go have a bite to eat. Spank-ME..I think i`ll go by Telawi and areas for the Loreal KL Fashion Week show here. Now ta-Ta.
