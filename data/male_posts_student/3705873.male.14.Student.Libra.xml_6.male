I'm an ugly sod living just outside London (that's England, not Canada). This is where I'm gonna post everything that pisses me off. And maybe a few things that were actually  good  about my day.  This is at ooble.blogspot.com because I use the name Ooble wherever I go on the net. If you don't know me personally, you'll know me as Ooble.  So there's my rant for today. Wow, I feel better already!  Oobs.
