(insert uncertain face). after four hours of doing laps from store to store we were all tired making for a quiet ride home. i could not just let my day finish there so then amber came over to my house this time. we saw this mtv show called Blink 182- Album Launch. it was a really sweet show because they basically taped the band making their new cd and show all the work that went into it. it was very interesting i must say, amber had a similar take on it. suprisingly you can find some decent shows on saturday night such as southpark and this comedy central special on richard pryor. he's the guy from bruster's millions where he just inherited a bunch of money but has to spend so much before he can recieve the inheritance. man mr. pryor was a hilarious guy and knew what he was doing when deciding his career. most importantly it was good to finally be alone with amber without a crowd of people, an annoying brother, and the like. i really am a happy guy whenever she's around not my usual puppy kicker self. then on sunday christine and i were suppose to tackle some chemistry. it did not quite work out that way though. we started having a long conversation on a broad range of topics with her older sister included. it provoked some actual thinking. about 4 hours and one delicious chocolate mocha later we started that homework. yesterday was laziness out the booty but hey it happens. also last night i talked on the phone with amber for a while. made a nice mood to fall asleep during.... but hey that was my weekend. it might not be most people's idea of a great time but those people are losers. i'm done for now but we'll keep ya updated.
