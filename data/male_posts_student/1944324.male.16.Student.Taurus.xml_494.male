Anyway, in other news: Today is the first day of the rest of my life, the last day of my life so far, and the middle day of a period of time which contains an amount of time before it and after it which are equal.  The point of all that? There is none. Enterprise is safe, at least for another year.  UPN is still to scared to axe Star Trek.  I'm happy, because I think the show is finally coming into it's own and getting pretty good.  It's still not level with TNG or DS9, but it's on Voyager or Original Series footing. Match up: 11 1/2 wins, because of the reason.  The square root of orange also wins, but only on a technicality.  Since I cannot surpass that level of weird, I will end the match-ups.  Some day, I will start a new feature, a great feature, an amazing feature, the feature to end all features.  But that day is not today! I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.
