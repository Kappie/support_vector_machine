    
       Starting tomorrow I am switching to the less demanding "Featured Movie" method in place of "Movie of the Day." It's just a little hard to come up with a movie, find a poster image, and change the link each day. Now I can simply change the movie whenever I want. In addition to this change, I will now keep an archive of every featured movie which you can view by clicking the link below the current featured movie. This way I will never forget whether I have used a certain movie before, and people can revisit past movies.
