Jones will not take me back and for some reason i'm happy because i dont want to hurt her anymore then i already have. if we did date i cant see it going anywhere... shes the kinda girl i like, she doenst do shit out of hornyness, she does stuff out of love, or so says her friend. and because i am a teenage guy, thats not so good for a short relationship... and as for a long relationship... i'm in grade 12 i need to start thinking about my future and what i'm doing in life, wasting 3-13 months on a relationship is not what i'm looking for.. yet Jones makes me so happy thati wouldnt at all mind just being with her, if i could actually see this becomeing something big i wouldnt be so scared. knowing that she has other guys after her hurts a bit, but knowing that i cant hurt her anymore is kinda nice... but not being with her hurts... life is so confusing, why cant i just like one girl... but i guess everything happens for a reason. if she takes me back the yay, and if she doesnt then thats okay too. thinking about Jen hurts because i know that Jones wouldnt like me tinkning about another girl... so its all up to her.  ttfn Cody
