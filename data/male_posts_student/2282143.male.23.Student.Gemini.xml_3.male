It was great though.  It was undoubtedly the funniest, most philisophical blog I have written.  It would have made you laugh, it would have made you cry.  It would have touched your heart.  It would have touched you in your special place.  Full of emotion, wit, and it ran the full gambit of what makes us human.  Once again, unfortunately, it is gone forever.  I dont think I have the ability to duplicate it.  Sorry kids.  Gotta just deal with this one.  Oh yeah, thats what it was about.  Dealing with things cause life moves too fast to care about the small things that happen.  Maybe I will be inspired tomorrow on Turkey Day... who knows.
