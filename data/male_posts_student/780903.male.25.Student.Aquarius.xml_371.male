He says that what disturned him most was that they called the student-helpers "volunteers" when in fact we were compelled to help if we wanted to receive public interest funding.  Fair point.  I just hadn't thought of it before.  Seems like a bunch of stuff at law school is voluntary without really being voluntary, like working for a journal (everyone does it).  Actually, that's the only other example I can think of.  I could say "ending up at a law firm," or at least "looking for a law firm job," but I might be overstating things.  I could also say "going to class," but that really is voluntary, and, judging by the attendance in some of my classes lately, not a voluntary opportunity that's taken advantage of particularly often.
