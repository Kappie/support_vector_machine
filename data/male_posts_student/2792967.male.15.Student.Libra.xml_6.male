The things she said about reegan just dont hold water agains my experiance talking to her. I think I might keep talking to reegan, and possily ask her out.  TO GET TO KNOW HER . if things work out, then Ill ask her out again. I think I need to make my own desicions. Also, I remember the countless times Ariella has over reacted to my actions. Reegan just seems so unlike everything ariella says she is. Ariella, if you are reading this, I mean no offence, I dont mean to make you angry, you are still my best friend. I just need to find this out for my slef
