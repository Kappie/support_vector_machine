A science teacher who falls under these four categories(I won't state names, but she hates durians) had a peculiar msn display name.      "When you're good to mama, mama's good to you"     Yeah. I agree with Jeremy. There is also another Math teacher who falls under these four categories. (Again, I won't state names, but Yeow Boon's Mum said... "So cute! I want to pinch his [Mr Lai's] cheeks!") made a very peculiar statement.      "Science teachers are redundant, while Math teachers are SHORT and SWEET."  Another clue: That teacher drinks too much coffee.  Quote from someone else "Drinking coffee stunts your growth..."
