I'm in the middle of reading Alas, Babylon by Pat Frank, and I haveto say it's damn good. The concept of the book is what the world would've been like in the 1970's-1980's had the Russians ever decided to nuke us, and the afteraffects of it in a small Florida town isolated in a contaminated zone that is set off from the rest of the country. I have to say that the book really brings out a lot of things that when you think about it would happen all at once. First, the complete and utter breakdown of everything civil in the world. The complete panic of people as they realize that the world they knew is now gone. Money has suddenly become worthless, and poeple rush out to buy things before any stores or dealers realize that anything anyone brings in is worthless except for trade. Like I mentioned ealier, I'm here waiting for Kristina to get on, but I'm not sure if she'll be getting on. She said she would be on around 10, and here I am an hour later falling asleep. Probably doesn't help that I haven't been getting enough sleep lately. Well, now I should be going cause I've got some eyelids that need some careful watching tonight.
