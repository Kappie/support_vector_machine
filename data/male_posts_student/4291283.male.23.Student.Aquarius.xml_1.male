N i feel so lonely without her... ahh~  So for tonite, i am going to watch The Replacement... nice quality dvd-ripped movie from #chow-kit... my rummet said it was a nice movie n he watched it for 10 times already... Keanu Reeves fanatic i suppose... hehe...  So this blog might be short because i'm eager to watch the movie rite now... i'll continue when i feel like it... to Rozie, I miss u a LOT...
