There were some great aspects of life at Centenary College, not the least of which were the relationships developed with students, faculty, and staff.  And a lot of that came from an environment of student/teacher cooperation, which is built from a low student to teacher ratio.  My largest class was probably my health class, which had maybe 30 people in it.  Every teacher knew my name, and most knew a lot more about me.  I took five classes from Jeff Hendricks, audited a sixth, and TAed two sections of Freshman Experience/English 101 for him.  After my Freshman year, getting to know a professor was not daunting; in fact, it was expected.    And I can't lie...this was not my first lecture.  I attended a lecture at the University of Arkansas circa March 1998, when I was visiting Matt Martin and Daniel Young...I went to Biology class with them, sat through the lecture, and even aced the pop quiz given at the end of class (on nothing more than the notes taken during class).  While the professor eyed me curiously, he never questioned my placement in his classroom.    Richard's lecture was exciting...he kept a room of 70+ interested for an hour, peppering the class with challenges, and throwing in humor more reminiscent of a comedian rather than a screenwriting professor.  I don't agree with some of his writing methods, but his structure has merit, and he seems like an engaging teacher who will support my methods in the discussion groups.    Back at JP's for office hours that no one is showing up to...it's to be expected, though.  Office hours give me a chance to work on my own projects, do some class grading, and write on the blog.  And the set time, written in a syllabus copied numerous times, makes me feel important.    I'm excited about the screenplay.  And that's important.  I spent a summer trying to get my past situated with my present, and for the most part it was an exceptional time.  But even with the healthy lifestyle, the inspiration, the reconciliation of several lost friendships, I entered this year unsure about my writing abilities.  I'm not a bad writer.  I'm probably a good writer, maybe even a very good writer.  I often enjoy my blogs.  But my honest portfolio doesn't exist...I've got a short film I would give to someone to produce, and I'm redrafting my only worthwile feature, which is currently on the DL while I work on this semester's soup.  But I love this semester's soup.  And I like my strategies.  And I like how I feel as I write it, and as I make a revelation for page 80 that hopefully will elicit the response that people create art for.    A cross between Katie and Jenie Garth is sitting 10 feet away, writing on her iBook and looking pretty sexy.  I always say that I really dig on brunettes, but looking over my last six years of dating, I can only put two brunettes on the list...the rest were blondes.  She looks over here a lot, stealing a glimpse while I write.  I steal a lot more glimpses.  But she walked in with a rather large, unkempt man that reminds me fully of a twentysomething Greg Simon (I hope the California crew still reads this blog...someone in the world better enjoy my Greg Simon reference).  And there was this odd hand on the back thing from him to her, and rubbing, and smiling...and every once in a while she will run over to where he is seated and look giddy, asking him to watch her belongings, or pointing out a phrase in a book.  She would be quite good at sex if she was with the right guy.  If he's the guy, I hope his unbridled state is not just in appearance.
