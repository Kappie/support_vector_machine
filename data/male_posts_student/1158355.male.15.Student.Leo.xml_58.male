KissableKerry69: Omg Omg...On This very day a Little girl named Katlyn Joshkaboki died at 7:01 on this very day ...age 2...ever since then on her anniversi of the day she dies Katlyn comes back to haunt everyone who gets this chain letter...at 7:01 TONIGHT you must send this to 13 pplz on ur buddy list...if u choose not to do this...u will be haunted by Little Katlyn 4 the restz of ur life...you may not think this is true but seeing a lil red headed girl with dark brown eyes that glow at night 4 the rest ok of ur life is maddddd scary...she has a gun nd a pocket nife she comes  to haunt u.... you better send this THIS IS NO JOKE...nd 1 more thing NO SEND BACKS TJG569: HAHAHAHHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHA TJG569: she's 2  I got another of a 5 year old killing you and that was before the 2 year old one, maybe the next one will be a haunting fetus with a machine gun that will shoot me everyday and some how I won't die. Seriously, some people have no life... like whoever made that 2 year old baby should be shot... no seriously. I'd shoot him/her if  I  had a gun. This country is so funny and pathetic. People are actually so superstitious they believe a little 2 year old infant is gonna crawl around with a gun haunting you for the rest of their life.  Today nothing really, except I didn't go to track meet because I was sick. Sucks for everyone who went! HA! Holy shit, at 7:59 PM I was playing with my stereo and dvd's arranging everything to look cool (because my dvd's are stacked along my stereo on my entertainment system) and I just thought of Pee Wee Herman so I yelled said Pee Wee Herman in a funny voice quietly. Nobody else was near me, I guarantee it would be impossible for anyone to hear me say it. My sister runs upstairs saying "Dad we're watching Pee Wee Herman." It was freaky.  "I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area, and you multiply, and multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you are a plague, and we are the cure."
