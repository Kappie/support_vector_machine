I couldn't talk to Michelle, my girlfriend, or play ps2/gamecube so i read alot. I read volume one of the Dhamon saga and im half way through The Second Generation (both Dragonlance books). I went out on an ATV, riding, gettin' muddy and sheet. Friday night we got a big storm, and i was sleeping in a tent outside my uncle house so i went and slept in the car around 2:30. The next day i did the same, but i also went to eh Rodeo and watched a guy get stomped by a bull. Before that i went to the mall and bought Shining Soul 2 from EB Games. over all, this weekend wasn't that bad, but i would have rather been home x_x.  Shining Soul 2 ownz you. peace.
