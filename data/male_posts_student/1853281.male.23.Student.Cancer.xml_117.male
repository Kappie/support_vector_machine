A. dropped of the bike J. fixed for me last night. It is super fun happy. Red, a Raleigh....runs nicely....what more could i want? thanks a million J.:) Found out the boy i asked out probably didn;t think i actually asked him out and anyways was seeing someone.....don't i have puss on my face! awkwardness.... found out another boy i like probably likes me too( there were independent confirmations by two seperate friends on two seperate occasions this weekend that there was some serious chemistry going on) But the consensus is that i will have to be aggresive as he is shy. so....nothing will ever happen as i am too shy. though in my current mood i am not so sure. I really seem ready to grab life by the balls. It's the only way to get the good stuff.
