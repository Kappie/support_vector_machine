Think of somebody shaking and walking like they have a giant condom over the top half of their body.  Exactly.  -  I'm devistated, Ray Charles died yesterday.  -  School was slow but awfully interesting.  First period, just watched Regan's funeral the whole period.  Second was too boring to even bother explaining.  Third, took an extremely easy quiz, and did more genetics stuff.  Fourth is where I saw something I never expected to see.  Kasey in pantyhose and other womens clothing.  It was so fucking hilarious, and Sarah even got a picture!  Fifth, watched more of "The 60's".  Sixth, free work period.  -  Will post later, maybe.
