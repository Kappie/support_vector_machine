Last night was such a good night.  I took one of my good friends to dinner as a graduation present.  Before I went to dinner I talked to my aunt who said she'd talk to me today (sat) and go over my law school personal statement with me and help me revise it over the phone.  SO, since I had that lined up for today, I decided I could go out after dinner and get sh*tty.  Oh drinks are fun.  Why does my liver strike though?  He (the liver) somehow got his hands on a pack of markers and a make-shift picket sign came into play as well.  He's marchin' around in there like he OWNS the place DEMANDING better treatment (and wages, which is what I DONT understand about the whole situation, because to my knowledge he's never been on payroll).  Anyway, we're (we being me) are SCREWED if like Captain Heart and Mr.  Mrs. Lung get involved in the strike.  Damn.  I'll keep you posted, later today I plan on having a sit down talk with Liver to tell him why I do what I do, and that I really do appreciate what he does for me.. all the filtering and stuff.  This has gone too far, I personify too much.. moving on.  Back to today.  First of all, I can't begin to be thankful enough for all the people in my life who help me so much with so many things.  Lately it's been very noticeable because so many have been helping me with one thing, this law school stuff.  I have such a hard time putting a fire under my ass to get all these tasks done to approach the daunting task of applying.  Everyone from my parents, to my former professor/friend, to LOLA (hi!!) has been helping me.  Each in their own very unique and special way, and I am eternally grateful for all of them and all of their help.  I know that wherever I get to someday, I will not have done it alone.  I'm thankful for that, because I am usually one to not want help, as I feel I can do it on my own.  I always feel like if I ask for help, that I'm not doing it "myself" and am therefore some what of a fraud.  This has been a good learning experience in that respect, realizing that I don't HAVE to do it myself when others are willing to help and are excellent sources of assistance.    Back to today (again), my aunt helped me in such a great way.  My personal statement has been revised so many times, but today my wonderful aunt helped me put the icing on the cake, so to speak (mmm cake).  I am getting very excited to be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with this application process.    Today's plans also entail going to the Christmas Party at my apartment complex. HA!  They said there will be PRIZES and FOOD.  Shit, all that is missing is a pinata and possibly roller skating and I'd be at an 8 year olds birthday party.  I'm excited though, to spend some time with l.e.e. (cause she's going with me).  YAY.  This will be fun times.  Ouch, Liver just POKED me in the ribs with his picket sign.  I'm gonna close now.  BEFORE I do, I'd like to say that I just do not understand the Lord of the Rings fiasco.  I wish I did, I just don't. I haven't seen any of them and I really don't want to.  Between that and Harry Potter, a cult is being formed somewhere in the world, I just KNOW it.  They turn these movies out faster than I can produce a web-blog on here.  How are they doing it?  Don't sequels to movies usually come out like, 2 years later?  There have been like 9 Lord of the Rings movies in the past 6 months it seems!  OK, I'm done.  :)
