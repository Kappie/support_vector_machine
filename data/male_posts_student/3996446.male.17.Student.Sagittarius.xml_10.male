Well, no, not confused, just a little afraid of what these feelings might mean. I have to get over Lauren soon cause its driving me insane, and I'm not gonna wait for her to like me again. I'm not a firm beleiver in the whole "If you love something let it go, if it comes back it was yours" thing. It doesn't work, and even if it managed to, life's got complications that make it impossible. Priscilla says me and Crystal are bound to end up together at some point in our lives as more than just friends. Which I have no huge propblem with, I like her and she's my Best Friend. She knows me better than I think I know myself. Kinda scary but I like that. I know without a doubt that she won't lie to me or cheat on me. And she's been the shoulder I could 'cry' on for a long time, well it has been to me. She's just been the answer to a lot of questions, wants and needs in my life. Yet there's a part of me that thinks taking my 'friendship' with Crystal to something else, is not a smart thing to do. I just broke up with Lauren three weeks ago. I have a bad habit of moving on really quick like to ease my pain, i.e. Amy to Markita in less than 6 hours, then Markita to Amy in a day, then Amy to Markita in a matter of hours, then from Markita to Jackie's bed, back to Amy, then,....okay, you get the basic picture. I think I'll just wait a few more weeks, or until I'm sure its 'safe' for me to move on, and know that I'm over Lauren, and well, to be honest, Markita and Amy too. We'll see what happens. PIZZA! YAY! Oh, yea, I got a whole two boxes of pizza to myself. Kinda weird, I'm not fat or chunky, I weigh 135 lbs, and I'm fairly slim, yet I can eat and eat. Stupid Extremely High Metabolizm!
