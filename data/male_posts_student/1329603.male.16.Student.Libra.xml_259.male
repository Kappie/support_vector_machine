I'm not just trying to push my post rate up, honest.  2 dates it'd be cool if people could make if possible;    7:30PM June 30th, Cheltenham Town Hall - Youth Makes Music (CAYO/GYWO)   7:30PM July 15th, Sir Thomas Rich's School - Summer Concert (Orchestra; Wind Band; Jazz group; solo of mvts. 2+3 from Serocki's 'Sonatina f√ºr Posaune und Klavier'; duet of 'Where I want to Be' from Chess, with Tom on the piano; first live performance of 'Madman's Love Song' by NJAN)    I won't die if people don't turn up for either (with luck, already secured 3 gorgeous people for Youth Makes Music, who know who they are (or at least Laura does)), but it'd be cool to see some people at either. I do so many gigs but the Tommies one is a bit special this year because it's our first airing of Madman, so I'm hoping it'll get a good reception... had a couple of ideas about the performance. More on that story... when you come watch it. Aha! Incentive. You see, you have something to look forward to now. Nyaha.  Love, Jon Roskilly
