Take a look at this prime example that Google is using... tsk, tsk...  Hmm... I have some homework to do before classes today, lets see, mathsmate (easy), english (peh) and um, that's it. Well, that's not too bad actually...  Oh and today we have Commerce, except Oeltjen isn't going to be there, so we get to bludge in the Library, that's pretty tops. So, how is everyone going with assignments? I've got a few left... Science is nearly done, English - I've got my ads, Commerce - Starting today, History - Haven't started... also for some reason, we have a  Tech Drawing  assignment.  What a rort.
