I love how every meeting between two or more of my family members inevitably ends in a huge fucking argument about my recent run in with the law. Although the intensity and volume of tonight's easily surpassed all previousdisagreements to become one of the the biggest emotional Holocausts ever witnessedin ourhousehold.Ended in quite the heated little talk with one of my sistersand I. More specifically, with her and I screaming in each other's faces from six inches away at the top of our lungs. Simultaneously screaming over one another with liberal usage of the "f word". Not stopping or breathing. Veins bulging.Just fucking screaming as loud as humanly possible. I don't think she listened to anything i said, becauseeven if i wanted to at that point, it wasn'timpossible to hear anything. I was just focusing completely on what I was saying, in vain, because obviously nobody could hear what the fuck was being said. To the spectators, it was just sonic screetching that instantly melted anyone's eardrums within ear shot. So Jerry Springer...   Ugh...It was bound to happen because of the copious amounts of alcohol, and the previous hour and a half's worth of in depth shit talking. Did sombody leave an oven on? Despite my better judgment, I walked into the gaschamber aka the kitchen where all of it was going on, to fix a bagel. And as consistent as the sun setting , I was dragged into it.No time was wasted for everyone to thoroughly drill me at the same time when all I wanted to do was eat my fucking bagel!Right on cue, Silvaniestarted personally attacking me instead of constructively "giving me a good talkin' to". To whichI defended myself, which fueled the already out of control fire storm, inferno of hell.   Despite my sister, and her infatuation with starting and holding on to conflicts over stupid shit,I don't want tohave a damper on our relationship.I know myfamily loves me,andI lovethem and can't verbally express my deep appreciation for their help, emotional and financial, but I can't help but feel Silvanie was just venting on me. Simply using this as an excuse to project left over feelings of spite for some other drama going on in her life. I really was listening and registering what they all had to say until Screamfest 2K4.   RWAAAWR!!!!!!!!   ....death.....   On an unrelated note, Velvet Teen and Littlecat tomorrow will rock my fucking ass. Will have to hold back urges tochoke all the scenies to death with their white belts...Jesus Christ this post is long...um...end.
