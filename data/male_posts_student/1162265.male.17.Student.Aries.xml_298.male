At the start of the day Mike and Katie, the directors, told us to come up with an all camp signal to get everyones attention.  The Pre-K lady had given crazy ideas at staff training on Thursday, but they were very childish to an extent that was... umm... silly?  So anyway, Micah comes up with one.  He says to us says "Let's do the Li'l John thing." So Mitchell, one of the head counselors (shannon is the other), says that's pretty cool.  Only Cameron could make that into something rated G.  It's really funny because the little kids loved it.  Later in the day at the park when we Mitchell screams "YEAHHHH!" All the little kids said "OKAY!!!"and ran to their counselors.  Only us.  Only us.  Best thing about the job is being with people my own age.  The average age is 17.  The youngest is 16, and the oldest is 19 or 22 (I didn't hear Christine when she said her age).  So yeah, it's all good, except the bad things.  75 kids in one place is a bad thing.  15 kids between me and Camille is also a bad thing.
