Maybe the best electronic device I own.  There is nothing to compare with having almost your entire music collection in one little, portable box.  Pulling up a song is effortless, and I have to praise Apple for the elegance and beauty of the interface.  The jog 'dial' is the greatest little thing since the mouse scroll wheel.  (It really isn't a dial, more like a touchpad you would find on a laptop, serving as a mouse).  The battery life clocks in at 8 hours 16 minutes in my all day test.  I ran it non-stop at my desk while I was in meetings, just to see how long it would go.  The firewire synch is blazing fast, uploading a 5 MB song in under 3 seconds.  I'm rediscovering music, and have abandoned talk radio for the time being.  Coupled with the iPod, I signed up for iTunes, and have made quite a few purchases (see previous anti-piracy discussions for background).  By the way, if anyone gets a free song from Pepsi and have no intention of using it, shoot me the bottle cap code by email.  iTunes is a great service, and I'm finding all sorts of interesting things there.  While I didn't buy it, I found a Johnny Cash version of 'Personal Jesus', which is just surreal!    There are some notable absences from iTunes, such as Dave Matthews and Metallica, along with others.  I imagine this is a record label issue, but I don't know specifically which labels have opted out of the distribution deal.  I'll just buy what I need in real CD format and rip them to the computer.  It isn't a big deal, but I've enjoyed the convenience of downloading.  Anyway, there it is.  Greatest MP3 Player Ever.
