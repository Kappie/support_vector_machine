I still have it at my parent's house, and I still set it up every once in a while and play all the games i spent a 12 year old's fortune on.   urlLink This  site has lots (all?) the games that were available for it, and links to a c64 emulator you can download.  I remember being so happy when I finally figured out and finished Maniac Mansion.  That may have been the best game ever, and one of the highlights of my pre-1990 life.  I had this printer that, as far as I could tell, was totally useless because it printed on a roll of paper instead of sheets-like a toilet paper roll.  I spent lots of hours playing lame Oregon Trail game that came with it.  I even used the games my brother had for his commodore 64 that he got 6 years earlier.  I don't think much changed in the design of the computer during those 6 years.   long live the commodore!
