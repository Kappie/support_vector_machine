I can understand a mother's anger at a daughter who doesn't clean her room after being asked. I can't understand a mother who would break her daughter's finger by swinging a rolling pin at her because of that. They're really zealous moslems, and I don't know, does Allah promote child abuse? This is not a solitary event, this is nearly nightly. Does rage make a sound? If so, I make it. I offered her room and board should she ever want to run away, but I wish I could do more.  I was talking to another friend, Rob, fuming at the sort of things her family does. I made the connection that maybe, just maybe, it's not stereotypical that moslems are completely and totally fucked up! Case in point, Sifat's family. She's the only sane one. Next, we have the middle east. They have been in a stone age state of petty squabbling and tribal warfare for 2000 goddam years. I can understand their anger at the West. I can't understand flying a plane into a building and killing thousands. We need to build a wall around the whole middle east and take it down in 100 years to see if they've killed each other off yet. Jesus. By that reasoning, the US needs a wall around it, too. The firebombing of Dresden. Two atomic bombs dropped on Japan. Slavery.  By that reasoning, the entire WORLD needs a wall around it! Humanity is just so incredibly terrible to itself. It really does make me cry sometimes, at the enormity and impossibility of the change needed to make the world a nice place to live in. The US uses up 60% of the world's resources. Where is the justice? Religion teaches love, tolerance, and faith in God, and then turns around, starts holy wars and condemns entire subsets of humanity just because they find guys cute rather than girls.  I'm trying to think, I'm trying to figure out just how I can change this, alone. Is it possible? If I help with solving world hunger, or even solving the hunger of one country, will that help in the end? If I turn to God and preach this message to others, will anyone listen? If I go into politics, will I be able to rise to a high enough position to make changes for the better? If I go into medicine, am I going operate on someone, save their life, and let them go out and hate some more? It's a damn big philosophical question.  I'm going to study for finals, make A's, and finish my sophomore year of high school. I'll figure out the rest later. Meanwhile, be nice to each other, it's the best thing you can do.
