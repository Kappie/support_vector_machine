As usual, patience and prayer come through, and God once again shows His mighty hand working within our church.  I woke up this morning to some chatter going on downstairs. Dad apparently had Pastor Ming Wong over and Pastor Kwong over to discuss the merging of WLAC and LCAC over brunch. At first when I heard about this, I was thinking I'd never want that to happen. Then I thought more carefully about our current situation in our church, and maybe it wouldn't be so bad after all. I mean, it may seem like a crummy idea, I mean after HYPE got established and everything, but then again, you have to let go sometime I thought to myself. I mean in a matter of one more school year, Josh and Steph won't be around anymore, so change is unavoidable. Also who knows, maybe this merge could benefit all of us. All these years, I have been hoping for the Mandarin and Cantonese congregations to merge back together again, as it shows unity not only as Chinese, but also as Christians, and we all know God's presence is always strong in groups.  Well after the two pastors left, I then also cancelled my badminton plans as no one was going. So instead, for the afternoon, I went and ran some errands with dad, and in the process bought much needed badminton birds, and also FINALLY developed some photos from May Camp. Next time I'm going to be developing the 80+ photos compiled of new years, TC 2004, and other random pics haha. So yeah my whole afternoon was basically that, and then by the time my dad and I were done, it was already time to go to HYPE. So went home to pick up clothes for painting, picked up Lina and Jason *in the order mentioned* and then headed to church.  We had some prayer, then painted, then left....all in 2 hours =).  Here I am now home once again. Gave Carmen, Lina, and Jason a ride back to their places, and then here I am now. Yup.....HYPE was pretty quiet tonight, with only 8 of us. Half of us are camping out somewhere....er Chinese Camping *Rebecky's dad was going to bring a rice cooker to camping....SSSSSEEEEERRRRRRIOUSLY* and Stephie is still in HK. The twins are somewhere, Toronto I think, and yeah I don't know where the others are hehe.  Anyways that's my rant for today.  Later.
