Between meeting that friend for lunch, that other one over the afternoon and the parties at night: life after our finals here in France is extremely active. Indeed, I apologize for my abscence these past days.  Moreover, do you think much happened this past week to talk about? I don't. June 30th will be both an exciting and most likely bloody day including the days that will follow. On a long-term basis, I'm pretty much convinced that the Iraq operation will be a success, it  has  to be a success.
