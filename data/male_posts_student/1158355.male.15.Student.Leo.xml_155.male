Basically all I did this vacation so far was hang out with Dan (having spooky fun at the tabernacle), Eric, Matt and Tom, Paul, Heaton, see Return of The King, go to Lincoln Center to see the Philharmonic Canadian Brass, and go to Old St. Pub with my cousins and have a shitload of laughter. We fulfilled our tradition of throwing the pickles onto the glass wall like they do in Billy Madison. Ok well, talk to you after the best day of the year.
