I did nothing at work except eat ramen and read Star magazine (My grandma loves Star and the National Enquirer, so they have many of them laying around the house. They make for interesting reading). We didn't get to work on Satan Car at all. I made a total of $8 today. We did have a little adventure today though... My cousin had to go to Houston to get a new fender for his truck, so we all piled up in my grandpa's new Dodge Ram and went to a used parts shop in a neighborhood that made me feel like I was in one of those goofy GTA: San Andreas screenshots. Well, he got the fender, and then we were half-way back to my grandparents' house when he discovered he didn't have his wallet. So we went all the way back to the parts shop, and his wallet was there with all the money intact and everything. We then all went back to town and I ate two cups of Chicken Picante Ramen.    I got an e-mail from Simon today. It's like the movie thing never happened. We're suddenly friends again. That's cool. He asked me to call our friend Bryce (who, off the subject, is the lead guitarist and singer of a band called the Unlikely Heroes) to find out where we are meeting on the first day of school in two days. I had actually called Bryce earlier, but this was before I got Simon's e-mail (I had been meaning to ask him anyways). All we did was talk about what we are doing tomorrow night (We still don't know, but we'll probably end up playing Halo or something).    Speaking of school, I finished my summer reading assignments today while watching the Resident Evil movie. We had to read through and put notes in the play Our Town and the novel A Seperate Peace. I put a lot of l33t speak and obscure anime and gamer refrences in A Seperate Peace, which is one of the most homoerotic books I've ever read. I take that back. It's the only homoerotic book I've ever read. Basically, you have a bunch of boys going to an all boys school. They frolic and stuff, and I would've thought nothing of it if the main character Gene hadn't said in one of his magnificent inner monolouges that another male character had a "healthy rump". Our Town was good though...    Well that was my blog for today. I'd write more, but InuYasha comes on in 30 minutes and I still have more stuff to do, like get a new screename.
