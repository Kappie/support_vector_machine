I'm 17, and I already have wrinkles in my face and bags under my eyes, a back and feet that hurt each night, and a cynical view of the world. I'd hate to see me when I'm 40, but unfortunately, I'll be living with me then, so there's no real escape.  I want to learn to play the guitar (gee-tar).  Adiemus makes me feel distant. I love the feeling.  Everyone and Anyone; I  LOVE  you. I'd hug you if I could.  I don't want to move on. I still have one more year of school, but it feels like these past three years have been quicker than a heartbeat, and there is still so much more I want to do, say, learn, think, achieve, love. But next year is it. After that, we all go our separate ways. Likely never to see each other again, except perhaps for the reunions where we all get together and realize how old we've gotten, and what we've missed. Life is cruel in that way. I just got into the swing of things, I've only just made friends, and then next year; *poof* Life: "sorry, you've got to start over" very scared me: "*gulp**tear* I'll...go silently..."  But I won't go silently.  Why can't I be honest  and  sincere? Why can't I be who I want to be instead of who I am. Or is who I want to be me and what I am what I want to be? Or... why?  I once got my palm read when I was small. I was told that, according to the lines in my hand, I was to grow up to do something I loved to do for my job. That's all that was said. I want a clue now... what am I supposed to do?  I 6r00v3 l1|  Huh, this post is getting long. SO STOP READING ALREADY. This isn't for you, it's for me. Selfish, but true!  I feel like I've wasted my life playing video games, and not focusing on my talents. Now that I am beginning to discover my talents, they are diminished to frightened squirrels in the corner of a room they got stuck in after jumping of a windowsill in search for food. They stoop in the corner, hissing and bearing their teeth at the huge creatures that mean them no harm. I want to feed the squirrels. Then let them go.  I haven't gone star watching in a long time. I miss it. Maybe I could climb onto the roof through my brother's window. That would be awesome.  Why am I up this late? I need energy to fix my car tomorrow. It will be literally held together with wood. A wooden car. Alright.  Now I'm off to find those squirrels. Love, (this word is not used enough)  tim
