Also, I saw my first, FIRST 'school' best friend from  urlLink Sherwood Christian Academy (Yes, I will and always be a private-school kid.)  It was so cool to see Corey Lawson. Oh, it was so neat. We used to be on the football (soccer) team together, we always sat at the lunch table together, sat in neighbouring desks, played on the playground, etc. (This was Grades 1-3) I felt so sad. Apparently, by the link above, they have a website. I sent an email to my first grade teacher (who is now the head of the entire SCA system) and I checked up on what I've been missing. I want to go back so badly now! It brings back so many good memories (as in my first crush: April O'Keefe, who I saw)! And it brought back the culture shock when I first moved to Lee and had to go to... a public school(!) You know, I've always wanted to be closer to God, and you can't get that in druggie-central Lee County. I think I oughta go back to Sherwood. I'll be driving, and I can ask Grandmomma  Grandaddy to do my tuition. It wouldn't hurt to ask. They have AP English... and a Drama program. I can still go to 4-H. OoOoO I want to so bad, now. :-(
