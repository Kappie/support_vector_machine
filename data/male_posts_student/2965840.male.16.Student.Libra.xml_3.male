OK so far break has been ok, just havent got that "skewl is over feeling" and once i do, i will be ballin'   This one is for kat... kat, i hope you know that you are one of the most awesome people that i have ever met and i can totally see me calling you up in 30 years and be like, "Hey lets ditch work and go to the carny-val!"  I really hope you know that and we need to get together more often.  I know i can be a jerk to people sometimes (this doesnt include stranger) and take things a bit too far, but i just want everybody to know that i think my friends are awesome and i will bother them to the day they die.  :)    Thats enough blogging for today so ill talk to yall l8rz.
