The M is okay (thank goodness!) but the M, C, D, O, and N in the name McDonalds was blown out! we were outside and saw the manager picking up red pieces of plastic! Then, on that big stone house on Rochelle by brandenburg, their biggest tree was uprooted and landed like 10 feet from their house! All the other trees was fine tho.   I GOT CANDY!!! I forgot that i bought a BIG plastic bag of candy in boston! I havent even eaten it yet! :-O!
