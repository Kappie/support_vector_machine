Well yeah the title is the part of me now having braces...I used to have em a long time ago but then swtiched to a retainer but soon my jaw was the problem..My bottom jaw was like longer than the upper jaw so thats why theres  a problem and also the reason why my face is long..  So went to the dentist at like 12pm...and like hmm haha found out my dentist is an Arsenal fan...it took like an hour or so to get it over with..he asked what colour I wnated and I like choose the darkest shade of black that there was so yeah..hahaha it looks scary to some extent...  So I gotta take this pain killer like everyday for like 3days..and like err my teeth are like super weak..I gotta use a plastic spoon to eat and bla..but in a week or so it should be all right so I can eat solids again!Im sick of this liquids diet..its terrible..Oh well...at least I can eat ice cream like mad and my parents not saying anything about it!
