The gay dude from "Dawson's Creek" was the main role, and then I hadn't seen any of the other actors, except this one girl who looked super familiar to me. I IMDB'ed the movie, and turns out her only other role was on "Joe Schmo!" Now THAT is funny....two lifetime roles. Hey, she's probably doing better than most of the other people from that show.     How come the "Real World: Shit they should have shown" was much better than the actual real world season? And why do they give away how they completely blow everything out of proportion on the actual show by showing the context that surrounds it? It seems to defeat the purpose. Oh well, at least I found out Jacquese had a date. Even if she was under 18.     More media..."Anchorman" was hilarious. On the "Eurotrip comedy scale," I'd say it was a little funnier than "Eurotrip." Will Ferrell goes overboard half the time, but the guy from "Daily Show" and the cameos more than make up for it. AND Ben Stiller actually said something funny. AND Christina Applegate is actually in a real move. COMO ESTAN BEETCHES? TONIGHTS TOP STORY-- THE SEWERS RUN RED WITH THE BLOOD OF RON BURGUNDY...I LOVE LAMP! (If you don't know what all these means, get off your ass and go see the movie. It's better than crappy "Dodgeball," and you all just loved that movie, didn't you!)     NCAA 2005 is out. I'm a bit disappointed. I haven't even played it that much, and usually I'm obsessed. The gameplay seems the exact same but harder-- the computer's zone defense is always perfect so it's harder to pass. At least the animations look realistic. The "celebration" feature is completely lame, however. Create-a-sign and all that new stuff is cool, but it's just not what I expected. I still like it though. Haven't gotten to recruiting yet, because I'm not like Ryan and don't build dynasties all day long (Landry comment, because Landry accused Ryan of playing video games all day long, sparking a verbal fight on my birthday.)     My dog threw up a lot the other day but is now doing better. Apparently she eats all kinds of plants in the backyard and it gives her infections. Now I have to leash her when I take her out, which sucks, because she loves the backyard, but she has to learn not to make herself sick. Needless to mention, I used up an entire bottle of Nature's Miracle getting the vomit smell out of the carpet. It was the equivalent of a human having food poisoning.     Rob is still trying to diss my blog. Go to his  urlLink blog  and see how crappy it is! It's just him arguing with his sister! Feel free to tell him if you are a registered user. At least I don't post about Thunderbird's biatch! Oh, and my computer is better than yours. I doubt you'll upgrade because you want to keep your 500mhz or whatever it is so you have an excuse not to get owned on Doom 3 by me son! Eat that! This blog war has escalated!     Well, I can't really think of anything else for now. Take it easy.     Peace out,   Alex
