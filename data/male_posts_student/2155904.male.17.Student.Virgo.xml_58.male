Then he actually ate some doughnuts for breakfast which he hardly ever has.  Then he just talked to some people and then played some games.  Then he watched some of the Seahawks and Purdy messaged him while he was away.  It was cool cuz it was unexpected and unexpected things are always unexpectedly awesome.  Then later that day Mandy messaged him too!  What a day!  But Tyke and Skippy went down to B^2 just to get out of the house.  It was pretty fun and they saw this 'oh so fine honey' there that is 'oh so fine.'  She deserves to be given a look.  Anyway, he came back home and had dinner.  Later Amed, Macaroon, and Dr. Phil came over and the 4 of them played NOT HALO.  They played Medal of Honor:Rising Sun with the 4-player mode and it was wicked fun.  Another totally unexpected turn of events.  Instead of being able to play Halo they had to play this but this was also a blast of a time.  Team mode was sick.  Nothing like a good Wellington...I mean Wellesley...I mean Weldon...I mean Welrod.  Yeah thats it, welrod.  Well anyway tomorrow Tyke is gonna call up some of his lady friends to see if they wanna hang out soon.  So all you chicas be on the alert.  Cuz this Ty-ger is on the prowl (yeah, already used that but it works here too).
