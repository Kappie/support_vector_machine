See, once upon a time I thought I would always vote ideologically, finding the candidate who best represented my perspective on the world around me.  But with this election...I guess I wasn't cynical enough to expect this particularly bad situation (what with the wars and homophobia and all), which is sad because I've always had a healthy cynical outlook.      I could never vote for Bush.  Ever.  And I'm quickly losing respect for people who plan to do so, considering that many of them were morally outraged by Clinton's lies but seem ok with the ones told by Bush.  I'm also confused as to why people are forgetting Bush's self-description as a "uniter" and his pledge to bring civility and class back to the White House.  Which his people have totally done.  I mean, Cheney telling a political opponent to "go fuck himself" is damn classy, as is Rumsfeld's obvious contempt for Congress.      And Kerry...Kerry was in Vietnam, which I suppose I have to respect.  I do respect it, but I don't get why it makes him better.  Maybe this week at the Convention he'll lay out a clear plan, explaining why he'd be better at fighting the "War on Terror."  And the war in Iraq.  And Afghanistan.  And I'd love to hear him explain why we shouldn't send troops to Sudan, seeing as those people are suffering at least as much as Iraqis did under Saddam (cause we fought there to bring freedom, right?).    Kerry's wife scares me, too, since on that "60 Minutes" interview she explained switching parties as a response to Republican disrespect for one man.  That implies that she's still ideologically Republican, which would be cool if she were a Laura Bush robotic/invisible kind of woman.  But she's not, and I don't know what kind of crap she'll pimp as First Lady.  Heck, I don't know what kind of crap her husband's going to pimp.      Which leads me to a thought: let's ditch the whole President thing.  The real power lies with the Cabinet, anyway, and the President just signs things.  That's the impression I get from Bush, at any rate, who hasn't taken responsibility for a damn thing, unless it's positive.  So let's directly elect Cabinet members.      Yes, it would mean very messy elections, unless we stagger them correctly so as to minimize the number of concurrent campaigns while not creating non-stop elections.   But the benefit would be that we could have a mixed government, which seems more democratic given the ideological split of the nation.  It would also mean parties would have to more clearly explain their positions in very specific policy areas, and everything would be broken down into easily-digestible pieces for voters.      In my fantasy world we'd even get a wider variety of perspectives expressed in government.  We'd end this centrist bullshit currently spewed by the only two viable political parties because candidates would have to articulate something.  They would have to have an actual idea instead of hovering around the middle position of nothing because gaining power would be predicated on differentiating yourself from other candidates by expressing an actual idea.  You'd have to be for or against something, voters would have to make choices and set priorities...God, it'd be Heaven.    Would it really?  Would voting for cabinet members directly even create functional government?  I don't care.  All I want is to vote without invoking the "lesser of two evils" clause, or the even worse "Anybody But Bush" phrase.  Is that so wrong?    Eh.  Random 3:30am thoughts.  Gotta love 'em!
