Wish i had called Rachel today. nothing interesting happened recently. i wonder if this will work...  the blogs of interest make me seem uninteresting. too bad im not some suffering kid in kuait who can use a blog. then id be interesting. man, people have their hearts in the wrong places. i wonder if thats a recent thing. oh well. G'night.
