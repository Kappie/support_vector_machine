Am sitting here listening to some random fairytale for the cousin's benefit...:/  But judging by the fact that she's happily dumping rubbish onto the ground, I don't think she's listening...  It's quite strange, its an amalgamation of Snow White and Goldilocks... with some overenthusiastic dwarves...  Now to wait for her to go to sleep so I can watch Kill Bill, or maybe The Mummy Returns... I shall see...  *atchoo*  Meh...
