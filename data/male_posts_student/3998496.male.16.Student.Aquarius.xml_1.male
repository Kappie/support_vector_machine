For thoes of you who don't know, Renee is my ex-girlfriend. I can't get her out of my head at all. All day was bad. I went to Office Max to get a ethernet card advertized at 4 bucks! i get there to find they dont have it. Plus I turn my head to see a girl who looked like Renee. Thats quincidence number one. So I go to get somthing to eat with Rochelle. The lady in the booth next to me has a lip ring that looked exactly like Renee's. Thats number 2 for thoes of you keeping score. But wait Bob there more. I come home and my friend calls me asking if I'm still with that chick (Renee). Got the entire day was like Renee fest. Plus to top it of, Me,Cherynn, Dave, Chris, and Rochelleare sitting in my car when Rochelle breaks one of my green neon lights. Now I owe dave 24 big ones. So I come home at like 10:30 and get online. Elaine is chewing my ass out cuz of a shity day she had. So then I tell her how today was like a Renee fest. And the boom! Renee is online. So we are talking and she claims to be thinking of me but not in a romantic way. Already seeing this not go my way. So she leaves and like I tell herlike I think of her everyday. I wonder what shes thinking right now. So im going to bed ill talk to you all later.
