They are a carpenter's spade. They gather, inspire, teach, and empower. To me words mean little if anything. I am a social inept and can't use words, the social equivalent of a man beating in a railroad spike with a rubber chicken. I should use less words. Words was off me like water on a duck's back. Because of Debate and other social activities, my tongue has been loosened and I beat a little harder. The words stick to me a little more. I don't like that.  I've seen the Passion of the Christ today. No words. "It was as it was."- Pope (attributed and denied).
