I wrote a lesson plan on Ecclesiastes at ACU, one of my titles is "why is youth wasted on the young?"  My observation of the world today is we do not want kids to be kids anymore, we push them to suceed at very early age, we now allow "kids" to graduate even before the age of 18, geez when I was in high school way back in the eighties, we were lucky to be at the age of 18 to graduate, some of my class were even older, okay I went to a red-neck school.  It is my theory we push kids to be adults before their time because we are jealous of them, perhaps it is also a subtle way to excuse our own immaturity as adults.  Again too deep of thoughts were something as simple as VBS.  Another cliche that is expoused is the miracle of life,  which is a way of rationalizing the supernatural in terms we can comprehend, yet I go to the other end of the spectrum, I see all children as miracles/gifts of grace. I look at my life and the gross injustice I have made of it, but I am extremely typical of all humans.  But God in his mercy has not ended this human experience he started many years ago, the world's population continues to grow with children who have a light which I truly envious of having, may we all strive to regain that purity of innocence of a child, yet let us not be child-like in our walk with Christ.  To be sure let us have him carry us, guide us and teach us but also let us not be selfish to receive his love or share his love.  LK 18:15 People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. 16 But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. 17 I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
