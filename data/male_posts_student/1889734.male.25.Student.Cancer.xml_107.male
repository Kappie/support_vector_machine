Odd since I loved his previous soundtracks.  I have to admit I saw Battlefield Earth in a theater. In fact, I went to a sneak preview! It had media people and the whole shebang. I went with a friend who got free tickets. I had no idea what I was going to go see. After the two hour bludgeoning, I remember the vitriol banded about by those in attendance. "Craptacular, Worst move ever!, That sucked!" All of these were heard. I couldn't believe I had just seen millions of dollars wasted up on the screen. If I had paid money to see it I would be too shamed to admit it.  Ine thing that I remember was the absurdly high soled boots. We're talking Japanese School Girl Style. 6" it seemed.
