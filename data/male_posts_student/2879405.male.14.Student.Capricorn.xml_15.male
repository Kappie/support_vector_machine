My pitching was as good as can be for today. I only wish i could do the same against PeiCai and that would surely secure a win. The game was too exciting for us. Nicholas made a homerun bringing 2 runs in (exculding himself) coming from below 4-5 to win the game 7-5(maybe we could had scored more) and that was the very last inning. They had no chances against us but i liked 1 thing about them. That is Good Sportsmentship. They even clapped for us when Nicholas made his homerun. They Fielded many sec 1s.
