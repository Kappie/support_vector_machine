Cost me $200. Damn I barely had enough. Took my whole damn paycheck. Well atleast I will be able to produce a lot of pics.  I went to the so called "buddist temple" today. Fuck it looked more like a cult than anything. Also I don't even think it was a buddist temple. It just looked liked a church because I saw I big cross. Urg!! What a waste of time. Just a church that was gated. It looked freaky as shit though. Maybe I can think of something to do there at halloween.   I have started watching the mandrian show "Quest USA" great ass show. The first episode was on yesteday. The USA team has a hot ass girl. I actually found her blog. Man does she love to talk about sex. She is so kool with it. She seems so awsome. To bad i'll never meet her even though she lives close to me. I hope she will still blog often though because he some of her blogs were like in 2003. All but one I think.  Tomorrow I am going to see the movie "envy" It seems dumb but I have to go see it even though I don't wanna. I hope something comes up so I don't have to go. In School today I sucked on my math test. Damn!!! But I think I owned my japanese. I love japanese!!!わたしはにほんごがだいすきです.  I want to get some pictures of junk later.   さよなら
