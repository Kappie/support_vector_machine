In order to make up the flavor lost through reduced fat, food makers increase the carbohydrate content.  Take a look at any food in the grocery store and compare labels between normal and low-fat versions.  The carbs are always higher.  Fat in food does not make you fat.  Your body stores fat when fat is not readily available in the diet.  Would you store water in buckets all over the house when you have a faucet?    If Burger King and others wanted to provide real healthy food, they would create an Atkins menu.  And they would have my business instantly.
