The Church today wants to be relevant, but is irrelevant,  It wants to be meaningful, but it is losing all meaning, It wants to be modern, but has never been more out of touch with it’s times.  Where have we gone wrong?  We have gone wrong by turning to church growth techniques and by turning away from the historical theology of the reformation, a theology that turned the world upside down.  Thanks to the marketing techniques that so many churches employ, there may be more people in church, but it doesn’t mean anything, because as David Wells says in his book,  God in the Wasteland :  “The fundamental problem in the evangelical world today is that God rests too inconsequentially upon the church.  His truth is too distant, his grace too ordinary, his judgment too benign, his gospel too easy, and his Christ too common.”   The Church, if it will attempt to fix these problems by returning to a biblical, Christ-centered, God-exalting theological foundation, can once more be relevant, and meaningful to the modern world.  The Church should be relevant- it speaks eternal truths that are never out of touch with the times.  The Church should also be meaningful.  No other place modern man can turn has the real answers to the hard questions that are asked.  If only the Church would wake up from it's malaise and break free from the bonds it finds itself in today.
