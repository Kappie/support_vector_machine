Kind of funny how we didn't get a whole lot, and the last time we had snow-somewhere around 1.5 feet-we didn't get school off. I guess a ton of people complained to Washington County. That'll show the idiots.  Saturday: Hmmm...lets see. Nothing during the day really mattered, but that night I joined the Woodbury Youth Orchestra (!!!). Apparently they needed a drummer rather badly, and I had been thinking about it for a while.  Sunday: This was go-to-church-and-get-home-to-do-homework day. Again. Not a whole lot goin' on on Sundays.  Monday: The English project seems to be getting bigger, and yet, less daunting at the same time. 4-6 pages isn't bad at all, and I've narrowed down my topics to just a few. The totally FREE concert was pretty dang good too. I went to the US Marine Corp Battle Color Detachment concert at the Xcel center. The bands were excellent, the precision rifle drill squads were most impressive, and the video clip "Iraqi Freedom: Chapter II" did not belong at all, especially when Bush's voice showed up in it. What can you do? This kind of thing attracts a lot of conservatives, but I went for the music. Oh yeah, and I could not find ANYONE I knew there...grrr...so I ended up with my own little private 3-seat row. Obviously the best seats were in front of the band, and were occupied by people like Pawlenty, Klein (f**$). What can I say-conservatives like this ra-ra America, free Iraq hooha. At some point, I think that the situation in Iraq is going to blow up and violence is going to run rampant. Not every kind of people there like the Constitution being put into place, such as the Kurds. So one ethnic group is getting angry at the other because of their Constitutional rights. Its sad, but it may take an extremely bad situation in Iraq where higher amounts of soldiers die, in order to get all these idiots to wake up and see what the f@#% is going on.  As for today, I'm spending the evening holed up in my local library working on English.
