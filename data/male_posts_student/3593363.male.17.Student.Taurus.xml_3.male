Ian B and I are going to start a venture crew ( a co-ed division of Boy Scouts devoted to high adventure) and I made a call to the district guy that needs to approve my project, and he said he can't approve it because I finished it already. I'm going to talk to someone else downtown about it, because someone told me to go ahead and do it already. (so i did it a year ago.) Preventing me from getting my eagle because of a technicality like that is just pathetic and defeats the whole purpose of the Eagle scout award. Anyway, the train ride to Philmont I wrote down (kinda sketchy) everything in my life and how i can improve on it, so i can live better, and for God. As soon as I get all this eagle scout stuff gets figured out I can relax and concentrate on everything else in life. I just pray that everything will work out. Myabe I'll go downtown tommorow.
