I have the feeling, or I know that I'm really nervous about telling Ian whenever I see him sometime this week, and you know what  it is  so I shaln't divulge any more upon you poor soles.  Well, where to begin?  Ah yes, when Dan and  "Wadan"  Jess Law and Ali decided to stay at mine that strange night. It was all dandy really and I managed to have a proper chat with jess for a bit, well I say proper but it was more of an information bitch about stuff I've never really opened up to her about before. Then the "white wannabe rudies" she so glamorously denounced them all (except Law) decided it was a grand ol'plan to hide my keys, which enticed Father into all sorts of emotionally charged cliches (blaming myself for it a.s.a.p) and so I had to foot the £7 for there faults as human beings. It's not just the £7, it's the principle of it, and Dan decided against re-embersing me with the sterling, electing instead, to use the sly-alternative and blame me for a Kessalar self-inflicted loss of a couple of quid.  Anyway the day later was the final exam in Maths which went rather swell, and then to Sutton with E to search for jobs what'shats not. We counted an average - slag per 10 seconds, which curiously was backed in the claim by a kind gentleman who was maticulous in his examination of the McDonalds branch in the high street and came to pretty much the same conclusion we arrived at, which was rather fun to discover. Clink  urlLink here  to discover more.  The Friday night wasn't all that great, Thomas was in the end, busy with his kittens and so, me and Anna waited to greet her new lover; BB5 Stuart wannabe Carl to arrive at Paddington, no later than 2 AND A HALf HOURS LATE! So no sin city and certainly no threesome. I ended up In Barbara's bed (Anna's Mum) which was quite a shock at 10 the following morning. It was however nice to see a certain  Chris Tarrent  at the breakfast table, discussing all thing television and alike with Barbara, and as it turned out, he was a rather down-to-earth bloke from start to finish.  Saturday was a night for me and Ian to engage in our extremely unique conversation, in which absolutely no-one apart from me and Ian would ever appreciate fully, which is just swell for the time being, not when, or if I ever move to SW8. We then upon leaving the German, saw Shrek 2, which despite it's brilliant prequel, was an outstanding film, easily outstanding its elder from start to finish.  Sunday involved me thinking of Thomas (oh shit I'll just do the post about him tomorrow evening  I SWEAR ) and strangely of school, and blank empty insomniac periods of null.  The poetry society beckons for this weeks adventure . . . xBuBzx
