Ok i noe it sounds strange using the tittle my first entry but i want to remember tat when i take a look at it maybe many years later = ) Today early in the morning i woke up at 7am... to go to the funeral of my lao ma (great grandmother) at boon lay. She was  95  years old and died on the  29th of july 2004 . Though not much contact, my family visited her every new year and i think tat she's a very nice old lady whom i respect a lot. Today, was the last day of the funeral and we and to walk come distance to "send lao ma" and we board the bus and uncle has and went to the place where the coffin was burn. Oh my... the site has change... 10 years ago, when my other lao ma (the 1 closest to mi die) while i was pri 1, there isn't anything like tat.. the site all had air-con and there was a place like giving a speech, some sort of hall. The 1 closest to my lao ma, the ladies cried while the men stood there watching in slient. Lao ma die peacefully... by the sleeping method. Everyone had quite a sad day there. I guess this is all for my 1st entry... a lazy person to write i am... with ' O ' levels coming, i must work hard ! For the pact 1 made with my friend = )
