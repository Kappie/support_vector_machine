So then the wife asks     the husbad to fix the sink. He replies "do i have    plumber written on my fore head"? Frustrated the     wife then asks the husband to replace the oil in    her car, her husband says "do i have mechanic     written on my forehead?" Mad at the wife the man    heads out to the bar.       A little while after arriving at the bar the man    feels bad about how he mistreated his wife and goes    back to the house and is quite suprised to see all     of the broken things fixed, so he asks his wife how     all of this was done, she replied "so after u left I    went out to find someone to fix all of the stuff, so    soon i found a nice young man to do it for me, and I    found out all i had to do for him doing all this stuff    was either i had to give him a cake or sex" so the man    asks what kind of cake did u make him? she replied "does    it look like i have betty crocker written on my forehead?
