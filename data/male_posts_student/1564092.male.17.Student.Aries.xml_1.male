The coolest thing was the fact that they were recording the concert to make a dvd! So Liz and I are going to be the first two in line to buy the dvd and we'll watch it and be like 'remember that?' and 'that was awesome!' You have no idea how incredible it was. They sang all the best songs. The best song with the lights and the screens and such was  Downfall . All of it was kick hash but that one stood out a tiny bit more than the others. I sang along to every single one of them, had the lady standing next to me cracking up because she couldn't believe that I knew all the songs by heart. The seats were awesome. The opening bands were awesome. (American Hi-Fi and Sugar Ray.) They sang my favorite song that they recorded. I bought a spiffy brown t-shirt. What a great f'n night! Oh yeah- The picture over there on the left is from Chicago not their concert last night in Atlanta. I was looking at other pictures from their other shows and all of those shows had the same set on stage but last night the set didn't really look anything like the set I saw in the pictures. Maybe it was because of the dvd but it seemed more intimate last night and more lights and more effects and stuff. Here I go again! lol
