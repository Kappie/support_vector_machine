Deep breath.)  INTERVIEWER: Hope you're alright there.  How are the interviews going so far?  ME: Just starting.  This is my first.  INTERVIEWER: And you're in for a long journey?  ME: I guess.  INTERVIEWER: So I see on your resume that you enjoy walking on hot coals.  ME: That isn't on my resume.  INTERVIEWER: So you don't enjoy walking on hot coals?  ME: No.  INTERVIEWER: Then why does it say so on your resume?  ME: I guess you're not looking at the right resume.  INTERVIEWER: Are you telling me I'm doing something wrong?  ME: I guess.  I've got a fresh copy of my resume, if you'd like.  INTERVIEWER: I don't need your fresh copy of your resume.  I'll stick with the one I've got.  So it says here you're President of the Female Asian Medical Student Association.  ME: Uh, no.  That's definitely the wrong resume.  INTERVIEWER: Do you want a job with my firm?  ME: Uh, before I met you I did, yes.  INTERVIEWER: Then you need to answer the questions I ask you.  What's it like being an ex-con, 63-year-old first-generation Korean immigrant at Medical School?  ME: It's wonderful.  INTERVIEWER: And why do you want to work for a law firm?  ME: I find law school intellectually stimulating, and think I'd enjoy firm work.  INTERVIEWER: This says you're in medical school, not law school.  ME: Like I said, that's not my resume.  INTERVIEWER: And this isn't my tie.  ME: Huh?  INTERVIEWER: I was making a joke.  Do you not have a sense of humor?  ME: If that's the thing that's hurting me in an interview...  INTERVIEWER: Do you want me to hurt you in an interview?  Because I can.  Even if you're a world-ranked boxer.  ME: I'm not.  INTERVIEWER: So you lied on your resume?  ME: That's not my resume.  INTERVIEWER: So everything on here is a lie?  ME: Not a lie.  Just not stuff I've done.  INTERVIEWER: So it's all made up.  ME: As related to me, yes, I suppose so.  INTERVIEWER: Great.  So you're a liar without a sense of humor.  And you think we should hire you anyway?  ME: Uh... you're twisting my words.  INTERVIEWER: I think I've had about enough of you.  (he stands)  Best of luck on the rest of your interviews, and you'll hear from us within the next couple of days.  ME: Thanks for your time.  (exit)
