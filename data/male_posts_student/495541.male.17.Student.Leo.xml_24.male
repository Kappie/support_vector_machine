It also may be that I like the way things are.  I doubt it’s the second, because I know I hate being like this.  It’s my fault, I’m pretty sure.  I doubt there’s anyone I could blame.  The fact is that people themselves determine the way they feel and how much they let something affect them.  Regardless of what people say.  You have the power to determine how much something affects you.  That is the truth.  There may be a possibility when something can be hard to control, but you always have the option to remove yourself from the situation.  For example if you were watching a graphic movie, and were afraid of the effects it may have on you, you could easily leave the theater, or stop watching.  It’s just your own fault if you don’t remove yourself simply because you’re afraid of looking weird.  I know my parents walk out of movies all the time because they think they’re horrible.  A lot of movies now days have pretty graphic crap in them.  The problem is that we’ve gotten so used to being subjected to them.  The question of whether something causes harm to you is a whole other debate.  That’s something that’s probably harder to find out.  I have to hear from my Mom telling me that I’m going to turn into a raging killer whenever I play a video game that involves guns or killing.  It’s pretty annoying, if you asked me.  I know that once I get talking about something, I can really go on and on about nothing important.  I don’t really care though.  I’m just thinking out loud.  What’s been going on in my life?  Well this weekend, I believe I will be participating in a basketball tournament.  I have no idea when and where exactly.  All I know is that it will be with a bunch of guys from Kennedy (my school).  We had a practice last Sunday.  It’s not technically a practice because that’s not allowed.  It’s ‘optional’ they say.  Sure.  The same goes with the morning workouts and the weight lifting.  They’re completely optional, but ‘it would be a good idea’ somehow turns into ‘you need to be’ real easily.  When will we ever have time to relax?  Do the coaches know how stressful it can be to be a teenager?  I don’t think they care that much, to be honest.  They don’t want to, either I think.  It would probably make us weak.  Lately, I haven’t been feeling well.  Currently, I have a bad problem with my throat.  It’s probably nothing major, but it is a pain in the ass.  It’s hard for me to believe that I have a problem with my throat.  I eat so many oranges all the time.  Vitamin C does prevent soar throats, right?  Probably not, that’s why.  I’ve been making the habit of putting a song of the day every time I post something.  This post is not an exception.  The song of the day is:  “Porcelain” by Moby.  It comes of his last album “Play” I highly doubt that you haven’t heard the song.  It’s on many commercial advertisements.  Pretty much the whole album has been on advertisements.
