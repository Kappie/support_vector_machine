Called Racehl at 4:30 or so and talked to her. That was a good day. What makes to day an awesome day was that I went to then movies with Rachel and her mom. (Her mom wasnt anywhere near) The Bourne Supremecy is what we saw. Great movie. Then when we went to go to the car after the movie, and Rachel tried getting run over. Although, I tried to get hit from a van, so, it evened out. :-P. The we went out to eat. Her mom left us alone and we sat and talked.
