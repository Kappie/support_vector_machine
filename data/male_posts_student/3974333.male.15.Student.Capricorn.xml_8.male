Mixed with old school solo's this makes for an awesome track. Paul McCoy's vocals behind the guitars, personify the feeling of the song. The varying up and down and mix between melodic and intense combinations throws this song up there with the best on the album.   Track 2)  The second song to grace the self titled debut is, in my opinion, the best on the album. Has sort of a Drowning Pool crossed Our Lady Peace theme. The lyrics hold a deeper meaning then to what some may believe on the exterior, but listen closely. (Hint: Listen to the lyrics as if they're a prayer/letter to jesus)   Track 3)  The way I feel, to me, really examplifies experiences I have been through. Again the mix of heavy guitar work working in symphony with the slower more mellow tunes, really makes this song appealling.   Track 4)  Open your eyes takes a different spin. The single notes are replaced suddenly by palm mutes and hammer ons. The swift pick up and slow downfall of the mellody works not in the favour of the previous songs as they follow the same suit.     Track 5)  The feedback at the begining gives the track a live feel, the chorus really sets this song on fire. At first glance this track seems a bit soft for me, but listening to it thoroughly, it picks up and drops off just as quickly.   Track 6)  I really like this song. The begining of the song really takes me, the lead and rhythm work together and mixed with an awesome beat and crazy vocals the lead in to the chorus is executed perfectly. I really relate to this song, listen to it, I gurantee any bloke who's been dumped will know what I mean.   Track 7)  The mild to heavy tune is carried through the whole song. ThoughI figure the highlight of this song is the solo at the end and the vocals, which remind me of David Braiman's vocals at the beginning of Down With The Sickness. (AWESOME SONG)   Track 8)  I love the riffs in this song, the mellow bit in the middle with the accentuation of the toms really works with the vocals. The heavy bit that lead into it aswell is harmonoius with the opening as is the finshing.   Track 9)  This song followed suit with the normal format of 12 Stones' songs, soft throughout the verse and the chorus absolutley blows you away. Again vocals are crazy and work well with the tune.   Track 10) This is a really soulful song in my eyes. The solo's really steal the lime light and are really evocative of how the song was written. The guitar work really personifies the feelings behind the song and, with powerfule lyrics you cant go wrong.   Track 11)  I reckon this song would really relate to teenagers. I know I do. It describes the feelings and boundaries instilled by parents and the effect they leave upon you. The phrase  "My Life"  I think describes the motive behind the writing and composure of this song.   Track 12)  Eric's Song really has a different feel to it, from interlude to chorus and note construction. Even the vocals seem different to match the theme. I am totally into the chorus and again the closing solo just takes the cake.   Final Verdict:  For a debut album, the boys have made an awesome album. I believe this is their defining moment and  Potters Field  will find it hard to match up. Such songs as  Broken, The Way I Feel  and  Fade Away  I believe will be the comparison to the new album. 8/10
