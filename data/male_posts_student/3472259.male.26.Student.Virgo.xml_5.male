It is disappointing to me that the media does not believe Piston fans deserve some coverage of their team, even after winning the NBA Championship.  The ABC postgame show was about the Lakers not the Champions!  The media bias was bad enough before the Pistons clinched the NBA Championship but I figured that after winning it would change.  I was wrong.  Apparently to ABC and the NBA the Pistons are not worth talking about.  The message I take from this is that I am not as valuable as a Laker fan.  It's ridiculous to have to listen to biased TV coverage.  During the regular season it's just fine to have a bias, but the finals are not a Laker home game.  It seemed as though Al Michaels starts every sentence with, "The Lakers...".Talk about the offseason in the offseason.   The Pistons deserve respect .   I, as a Pistons fan, deserve respect from the media.   The Lakers are a soap opera, I LIKE BASKETBALL!  Kobe Bryant is not the next Michael Jordan he is the next Anfernee Hardaway.  Some people said Anfernee was the next MJ, but when Shaq took off suddenly he's not so great anymore.  Granted they are very good players, but greatness requires more than fancy moves and a good jumper.  It is very ironic that Karl Malone's new team got beat by the Pick-n-Roll.  The play he and John Stockton almost perfected comes back to bite him in the ...knee?  I know Gary Peyton WAS good, but why is he a Hall-of-Famer?  Was he better than Joe Dumars, Bill Laimbeer, Vinny Johnson, or Mark Aguirre???  What did he ever win?  Is Jerry Stackhouse a Hall-of-Famer?  He put up some huge numbers also, does this qualify him?  If he played in LA would he be considered one?  Shaq is a dominant force, it's too bad the "Zenmaster" doesn't know how to use him.  The Pistons played him pretty straight up in every game.  I was told Shaq would "Break Wilt's single game scoring record" against single coverage.  I didn't see or hear about any adjustments made to get him the ball more.  The only ones they mentioned were to get Kobe Bryant to the free-throw line more.  He sure used some zen on the refs.  Maybe he wanted his players to stop thinking about winning and concentrate on the officiating.  It worked wonders.  It sure looked like Jackson was out-coached by Larry Brown to me.    The Laker fans complain about bad officiating.  This, of course, is ridiculous.  The Lakers always get the calls, ask Vlade Divac.  Just this year the Lakers have benefited from some iffy calls.  Derek Fisher seems to be the only person ever to be able to catch-and-shoot in less than .6 seconds.  Ask Kelvin Torbert of Michigan State about that rule.  The only game the Lakers managed to win in this series hinged on a questionable call.  Conceding the bunny, both Ben and Rasheed went straight up against Shaq and the refs gave the Lakers a chance by blowing the whistle for a three point opportunity.  Had that call not been made, the Lakers would have been down by four points.  They would have needed to foul and hope for missed free-throws.  Assuredly, the Lakers would have lost.  Regardless...   The Detroit Pistons are the 2004 NBA Champions
