We finally decided to watch Harry Potter. The movie was to start at 6.15. It was only 5.30 so we decided to eat. We ate at Long John Silver. The movie was nice but confusing. U need to read the book to understand better.It was also quite funny and Emma Watson is damm hot. She is only 14 but she is so beautiful. Of course not so beautiful as someone I like very much.  Enough of that. After the movie went to Heeren. My fren wanted to buy a cd. We look around HMV for unknown artist and new cds.I just love going to HMV. We came across this  band called the New Found Glory. Their music is ROCKING GOOD. I downloading their music now. Gtg now.
