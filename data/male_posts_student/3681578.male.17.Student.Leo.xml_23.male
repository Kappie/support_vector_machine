I'll be watching "Enemy of the People" by Tangahalang Ateneo...mainly because Dr. Pes required us to do so...I do hope its fun...well, I don't expect it to be fun but I hope it is, even slightly...  Um...I only have two 90-minute classes today...Math 21 with Ms. Aberin, Doc Mara's substitute, at Schmitt Hall (C-109)...and Fil 11 with that damn Joseph Salazar at Kostka Hall (K-301)...  I'm actually enjoying classes in Math with Ms. Aberin mainly because she does not follow Doc Mara's...er..."Methods" of Teaching...she is active and likes response from the crowd she is teaching...  Joby, Clark and another math classmate of mine will be leaving today supposedly for IMO...I do hope what Joby said comes true...that we are going to have free cuts in Math for the whole next week...hehehe...  Filipino is so damn din...I forgot to tell you that last time, he gave me a 6 out of 10 for an essay quiz for which I expected full marks...kasi he didn't tell us that he was looking for the "kabalintunaan" in the poem, he just asked us this and I gave him that and even cited from the text...anyway, I'm not fuzzy about that anymore...  I have a paper for English that I'll be doing this night and I have a whole lot of work for the weekend that I may not be able to watch the UAAP Opening Game with my classmates...  Its not the game I'm fuzzy about...Its about maintaining bonds with my classmates which getting more and more difficult by the moment...tight schedules, organizations, school life, etc. There are just to many hindrances...  However, I want to push myself to go to UP on friday kasi I told my friends I'll do so...the next available moment...  So there...  I'll be discussing ORGASM with you next time...    Until that horny moment...    Mwah!
