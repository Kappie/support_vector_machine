In particular, they evolved two ways of thinking, speaking, and acquiring knowledge, which scholars have called  mythos  and  logos .  Both were essential; they were regarded as complementary ways of arriving at truth, and each had its special area of competence.  Myth was regarded as primary; it was concerned with what was thought to be timeless and constant in our existence.  Myth looked back to the origins of life, to the foundations of culture, and to the deepest levels of the human mind.  Myth was not concerned with practical matters, but with meaning.  Unless we find some significance in our lives, we mortal men and women fall very easily into despair.  The  mythos  of a society provided people with a context that made sense of their day-to-day lives; it directed their attention to the eternal and the universal.  It was also rooted in what we would call the unconscious mind.  The various mythological stories, which were not intended to be taken literally, were an ancient form of psychology.  When people told stories about heroes who descended into the underworld, struggled through labyrinths, or fought with monsters, they were bringing to light the obscure regions of the subconscious realm, which is not accessible to purely rational investigation, but which has a profound effect upon our experience and behaviour.
