This is clearly not accurate whatsoever in comparison to an actual poll. Fucking Massachusetts is red. Massachusetts! It's a good thing most AOL users are too fucking stupid to read or write, or gays, women, minorities, the lower and middle class, and families of soldiers would have a tough time come November.
