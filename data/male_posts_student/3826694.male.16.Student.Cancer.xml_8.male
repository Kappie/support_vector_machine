I personally don't enjoy harsh treatment for my denomination because the SBC feels that they are the only group deserving of God's care... Therefore, they will be "PWN3D" for telling me I'm going to h3ll for being a Catholic.  You don't believe it? Here you go...   A man went to heaven and was being shown around by St. Peter. As they went from cloud to cloud they came to various doors which St. Peter would open.   One showed a large group rolling on the floor and talking in tongues.  "Our Pentecostals," he said.   Next was a serious ritual. "Our Jewish persuasion," he explained.   Then another ritualistic service. "Here's the Catholic mass."   At the next cloud, he didn't open the door but instead put his forefinger to his lips in the hush motion and they both tiptoed past. Once past, the man asked what that was all about.    "Those are the Baptists," St. Peter explained. "They think they are the only ones here."   I'm quite serious... you're not the only people. Recognize that other people can do what they want! Listen to this account...   I was walking across a bridge one day, and I saw a man standing on the edge, about to jump off.  So I ran over and said "Stop! Don't do it!"  "Why shouldn't I?" he asked. I said, "Well, there's so much to live for!" He said, "Like what?" I said, "Well... are you religious?" He replied, "Yes, very." I said, "Me too! What religion are you?" He said, "Christian." I said, "Me too! Are you a Catholic or a Protestant?" He said, "I'm a Protestant." I said, "Me too! Are you an Episcopalian or a Baptist?" He replied, "Baptist!" I said, "Wow! Me too! Are you in the Baptist Church of God or the Baptist Church of the Lord?" He said, "I'm in the Baptist Church of God!" I said, "Me too! Are you in the Original Baptist Church of God, or are you in the Reformed Baptist Church of God?" He said, "I'm in the Reformed Baptist Church of God!" I said, "Me too! Are you Reformed Baptist Church of God, Reformation of 1879, or Reformed Baptist Church of God, Reformation of 1915?" He said, "Reformed Baptist Church of God, Reformation of 1915!" I finally said, "Die, heretic scum," and pushed him off.   I really think it's getting bad... first Disney World, now schools?  Recently, I found a list someone had compiled on the web. This really helped clear a few things for me...   You might be a Southern Baptist if...   - You think John the Baptist started the SBC. - You think God's presence is strongest on the back three pews. - You think "Amazing Grace" is the national anthem. - Your definition of fellowship has something to do with food. - You ever wondered when Lottie Moon and Annie Armstrong would get paid off. - You honestly believe that the Apostle Paul spoke King James English. - You think worship music has to be loud. - You think Jesus actually used Welch's grape juice and saltine      ers. - You judge the quality of a service by its length. - You believe that you are supposed to take a covered dish to heaven. - You have never sung the third verse of any hymn. - You clapped in church and felt guilty about it all week. - You are upset that the last hymn in the new hymnal is numbered 666. - You happen to know that Lottie Moon is not a member of the Unification Church.   Luckily, I kept them for one line... you've all got your deserved "PWN493". Hopefully, by posting this, some may become more open to the rest of the world's beliefs. If not, consider yourself on my "To PWN" list...
