Testing today was intereting enough, it really didn't stress me at all.  Infact, I'm rather happy.  So, I spit in your face world.  Not litterally though.   I realized I'm more or less stuck in a Religious triangle.  In my times of greatest spiritual power, I think Quaker, in my times of greatest pluralism, I'm Baha'i, and in my moments of Atheism/Agnosticsm I'm Gnostic-Pantheistic.  The problem is that I'm quite sure that the Gnostic-Pantheist view, is going to become secular pantheism.... and my religious world will probubly only shirnk.  What a shame.  A shame. Adieu Adieu.    On a bright note, Ryan told me to try out for FNL next year and he was really pushing for me to be in it.  That made me feel warm and fuzzy inside.  Ryan is so cool, with his tallness, and his tight 80's band shirts for a type of music I've never listened to in my life.
