I am the son of John Steeves and Donna Steeves (she was Evans at the time she met my father, and before that she was a Cluett). I have four siblings: Jordan Steeves, Kelly Steeves, Megan Evans, and Daniel Evans. Myself and younger Jordan are the children of John and Donna; Kelly is the daughter of John and his exwife Barbara, and they both live in Ottawa; Daniel and Megan are the adopted children of Donna and her exhusband, who I am afraid I don't even the name of. I do know that this exhusband died of a heart attack in March, and that Megan and Daniel went to the funeral back in Newfoundland; my mother did not feel the need to go.  Megan moved to Calgary in search of work about three years ago, and the last time I saw her was when she came down for Christmas. She is funny, nice, very quick-witted, and generally an awesome big sister. At the time when she left, I was too young to appreciate how cool she was, but on Christmas, we really had fun. Her apartment is now occupied by someone else; no more Christmas trees with beer bottles for stars. She has had a few jobs back in Calgary, and I wouldn't be able to tell you which one she's on now. I miss her very much.  Kelly has, of course, always lived in Ottawa, so I've never had much contact with her. She is one of my greatest friends in the world, however, and whenever she visits, I try to make the most out of it. The last visit was of about two weeks in late February 2003. She has since become 'going to be engaged,' and at the end of August I'm going to meet her 'soon-to-be' fiancee. I am of course terrible with names, but this fellow is German, who I believe she met either studying at her college in Ottawa, or possibly on one of her trips to Latin America. (Kelly has had an extended period of time in Central America, and I believe she also visited Argentina when she was thirteen or so?) Whatever the case, Kelly spent some time recently in this fellow's village back in Germany. Her current location is Yellowknife, where she's working with a architectural company design a website. (Kelly's major in college is architecture.)  Daniel is the big tough one. As the oldest, he moved out the earliest, but he never left Sussex. He was rather aloof for a few years, and then his girlfriend got pregnant, and he lived with us for just over a year while he went to university, working on mechanics. I got to know him pretty well over that year. About a year ago, he moved in with with his girlfriend, Suzanna, his daughter, Arianna, and Suzanna's other children, Julianne and Ashley. He got a factory job in Moncton, and with his massively increased income, they bought a new house in town. (They had previously been living in the nearby backwoods of Nightville.) He spends a good portion of the day working, and he also has to commute about an hour between Sussex and Moncton; the time to spend with his new family is limited.  Jordan is the only brother who is just a brother. Not a stepsister, not an adopted stepbrother. He is also the only sibling younger than myself, and he is the only sibling I currently live in the same house with. He is currently a yellow belt in taekwondo, and has built himself a nunchaku, a three-sectioned staff, and two tonfa. He also bought a gundo sword (wooden, for training purposes), and I bought him a birthday gift: two professionally made tonfa. It put a bit of a hole in my wallet, but I'm wealthy for my age, so meh. Jordan's most notable feature is his hair, which is a monstrous, black, curly thing. Large curls. Like, you can stick a finger in the loop of the curl without disturbing any hair. I'm not exaggerating. He's rather shallow - swears a lot when his friends are over to look cool, for an example - but he's young.  In a way, I have new brothers and sisters in Arianna, Julianne, and Ashley. Because Suzanna and Daniel do a lot of work, my mom, the benevolent grandmother, takes care of Arianna during weekdays, and that means that her uncles take care of Arianna as well. We don't do quite so much, but we definitely play with her; she is absolutely adorable, no question. Julianne, being an athletic youngster (he's what, seven?) who loves cars, skateboarding, biking, etc., has steered towards Jordan a bit more, but we occasionally play a videogame or a game of badminton. Ashley, being older and more mature, is more my side. Checkers, chess, teaching me Spanish, all good. (Yes, Suzanna is an immigrant from Colombia, and is as thus fluent in Spanish; her mother, who lives in Canada and in Colombia alternately, actually has some difficulty with English. They have both taught the children a great deal of their mother tongue. I stick to English with all of Suzanna's family, because if I start speaking any of my very little Spanish, I trail off into French, which I am near fluent in.)  Speaking of Suzanna, she is awesome! She's very buoyant, very Latin. Everything is fun for her. Once, when I was babysitting Julianne and Ashley, Suzanna came home two hours later than expected, so I got home at two o'clock in the morning. "We're going to be in so much trouble!" But it was an adventure! And it was a damn fun one too; Nightville is, to be honest, Texas Chainsaw Massacre country, so when things don't go right, it gets pretty fun. When Suzanna brought me and Jordan to Julianne's birthday party (at their dad's in Saint John), we had more private jokes than you could believe possible. Suzanna rocks. Plain and simple. ^ ^  My father has three brothers: my uncles Allan, Glendon, and Ross. My mom has one sister, Barbara, who insists she be called Aunt Boo. My mother's mother is my only living grandparent. (My father's mother, much older, died last March. My papa on my mother's side died when I was very young, and I have only one memory of him. He was lying on his deathbed. I also remember the ambulance taking him away. My grandfather on my father's side died young in the 1950's.)  I recently learned that Uncle Allan has cancer, which Glendon's wife, Edna, died from a few years ago. I like Uncle Allan, and his wife Aunt Sheila. He is the closest of my uncles to me, and she the closest of my aunts, showing more interest than Ross or Glendon or their respective wives. (Glendon remarried). I very much hope this cancer proves to be one that can be treated.  My mother is awesome. She is of course a Newfoundlander, and as thus she is a master of speechcraft. Newfoundlanders entertain with words. It's in our blood. She currently has no profession beyond babysitting, but used to work as a chemist in Newfoundland and had a brief go as editor of the Kings County Record. But yes, she certainly is an entertaining person. She's buoyant as well, which may be why she and Suzanna enjoy each other's company so much. And she is, of course, a little bit ridiculous, outspoken, and eccentric. But I love her. ^ ^  And then there's Dad. He is a traveller, having been to such exotic locales as Borneo and Singapore, Thailand and Cambodia. (He was actually in Cambodia when the Americans under Nixon made their first 'incursion' there. There was some panic, and he escaped the country.) He also lived for a long time in the Yukon. His profession was for the longest time that of a journalist, but he is now a writer. He's a bit of a bore, to be honest. But he's okay.  So, that's the family. Hope you enjoy.
