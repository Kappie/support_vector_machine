It was hilarious, because afterwards they were saying all this crap about us, and I burned them on everything they said. Then again, they are stupid rednecks, so it was pretty easy. Anyways, we aren't currently playing because no one is joining our game but I'm sure someone will join. Anyways, that damned question is still bothering me, but I'm sure I'll eventually get over it. Anyways, I'm playing lacrosse tomorrow which should be pretty fun. Also, expect more posts not about Halo because my gaming binge is almost over - lol! Anyways, back to Halo.  later, bradleyJ
