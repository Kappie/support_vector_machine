For those of you who don't know ,i'm a class 12th student of Delhi Public School,R.K.Puram,henceforth referred to as The Factory.This year I have been extremely fortunate in getting all the HOD's as my teachers,something unprecedented in The Factory's history.  here's a description of my teachers-  1.J.S.Virdi(Da Sardar)-HOD Physics and my first ever sardar teacher.Quite good.Has threatened the class with dire consequences if anyone scores less than 95% in the Boards.Only problem-some wicked soul of the Timetable Deptt. has fixed all his periods with us at around 12'o'clock.  2.Meena Dhami(Da Owl)-HOD Chemistry.Being in her class is the surest way of getting into IIT.Last year,around 37 out of her 50 students made it ,a success rate of 74%.Has a penchant for treating students like 4-year olds and for physically acting out chemical processes. Sample-Reversible reactions are indicated by crossing arms,ionic bonds with interlocking of fingers.  3.Sushma Suneja(Odoyo ki maa)-HOD maths.Has an uncanny resemblance to the Kenyan cricketer Thomas Odoyo.Most of us believe that he is her son who was lost at the Kumbh Mela.Terrorizes class by randomly asking complex trignometric formulae.  4.Renu Nayyar(Da soporific)-HOD Economics.Has the enviable credentials of being the first teacher to have induced drowsiness in me since the legendary days of Sweezy Madan.  5.Rewa Mahajan(Da Penguin)-the only non-HOD teacher and also last year's classteacher.A highly strict but sincere English teacher,is known for giving astronomically high marks to the deserving and her PJ's. Sample-"Everytime you don't come in school shoes/belt/socks,i will fine you 1 rupee and by the end of the year,I'll be able to buy myself nice Banarasi saris".  I'll say it again though,i am extremely lucky in having them as teachers in my Board year and don't dream of having any others despite their shortcomings
