I suppose any place begins to feel like home after a while, but I was blessed with some of the greatest friends anyone could ask for to share a trip with. Sorry to wax all emotional on you guys, but I feel so far removed from not only Barcelona, but from Europe in general and all you guys. I heard from Vegard, and he's loving it in the land of Yao Ming. He reads the blog whenever Ulli sends it his way. Hope to see more new faces on here soon. Sorry I couldn't think of anything clever to say tonight...first time for everything.   Missin everyone, Tim
