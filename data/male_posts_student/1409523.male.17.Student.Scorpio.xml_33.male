"... ok i am cool with the not having sex thing.. whatever... im catholic...itll wait anyways.... but a little making out would be more than fine for me..... AHHH.... my lack of any type of action annoys me to no end.. well im going to bed ...because i have nothing else to do and it is 1 o clock... for those who read.. sorry for the bitching.. but it has to vent somewhere and i choose to put it up here....  Nate :(
