Today he got iced in so he didn't even go to KING 5 again to work.  He has 12 hours done so far but still needs 18 more.  Oh well it is pretty fun work and he has 3+ months with which to complete it in.  So he just sat on his skinny ass all day again.  That is 2+ days now of not seeing anybody.  He is getting cabin fever.  And this is nothing.  He is probably too much of a social person.  Whenever he could be hanging out with people and isn't he gets a little annoyed, and oh so bored.  So he talked to a few people online.  Mainly Kinker cuz everyone else seemed to be out enjoying themself with other friends in the snow and ice.  Like all of Tyke's Coug Mount friends had people around.  Kinker and Tyke got bored but at least they got to talk to each other about the usual, sports mainly.  Well since today had nothing good to write about and Tyke is not looking forward to anything, he might as well cut his losses here and just stop writing.  Let's see how many people IM him and tell him they were disappointed with the blog.  His guess is 6.
