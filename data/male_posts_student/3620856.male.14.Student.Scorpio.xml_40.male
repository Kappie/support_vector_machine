I know the people around me are not people I can trust, so, why I should I tell them how I feel? I also know that they don't even care about how I feel. They just care about themselves. I remember a teacher of mine once said that we got to have other people to support us, as we are human beings. We cannot support ourselves. We need the help and support from our friends. But, who are my friends? I used to lie to myself that I have some friends I can trust. But, I found out that when you are really in trouble, no one's going to help you. There's only one choice. It's to face the problem myself. I used to treat this person as my friend, but, he only cared about himself. He didn't even helped me when I was in trouble. And the problem I was facing was very big. He could've helped me out, but, he just turned his back on me. So, I don't really trust anyone now...  Someone once said about how people act differently in front of their friends. I find it very true, as it also applies to me. I talk a lot of rubbish in front of my friends. I act lame in front of my friends. But, I keep to myself when my friends are not around. I have to put on an act when my friends are around. This applies to many people. I think it's just because we're afraid of people seeing our true selves. But, I've found out that the more we put on an act, the more we become afraid of showing others what we really are like. We are afraid that when we show our true selves, no one will accept us. I too am afraid of people seeing another side of me. I can do nothing but to carry on the act. But, do we really have to put on an act? I feel that the more I continue this act, the more I lose myself. I'm beginning to forget who I really am. Sometimes, I just cry in pain, in a cold dark corner. But, no one even cares. No one can be bothered with me. To me, I feel that I've got no purpose in life. I'm just an empty soulless shell, wandering the earth. Anyway, no one really cares, no one will care. I've really got no future. Everyone hates me. I'm just an obstacle to everyone... I should just go far away from everyone and die... Even if I die, no one will remember me. Not even my parents...   I have many regrets in life. One of them is staying alive...
