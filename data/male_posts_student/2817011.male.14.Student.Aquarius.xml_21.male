But no, seemed that hopping into the car along with those that you will be able to hang out with over the Summer is better. . . is easier. . . will make you happier. . . Guess I must not mean much to you anymore. . . .Tanzi's words are floating about now, must shun them>_ : : :Sorrie, just had to let it flow, might not mean it in a couple minutes: : :
