The past few days here in Minnesota has been strange, even for Minnesotans.  The weather here is always odd.  One day it is 90 degrees, the next it is 70.  Yesterday, the temperature hit a high of 59 in our area.  It didn't even make it past sixty.  Last time I checked, this was August, not October.  Anyway, school is catching up to me.  I go back on September 8, only to report to work, study, and less sleep.  Hopefully I can get out of my "sleeping in" routine.  It is very hard.  Maybe if I stay up all night, I will be very tired the next evening, go to bed early then get up early.  Too much work.  After reviewing what each candidate has to offer for the presidency of our great nation, I have determined that Bush is the best candidate.  I am not going to get into why he is or why Kerry isn't.  It is my personal opinion, and what is great about our country is that we can have our own views and opinions.  I have seen politics tear families apart.  When you start to get into a political debate, run or change the subject.  Anyway, back to the candidates.  Both of them have pros and cons.  In fact I think that Bush was wrong to go into Iraq so early.  It needed to be done.  Saddam needed to be thrown out.  But I personally believe that there are bigger threats.  Now Kerry would be a good president with his health coverage plans.  The only thing is will he ever be able to do them.  Thats enough with politics.  About my vacation, I had family fly in from Ohio.  It was very unusual for them to experience 50s and 60s in August.  The weather kind of scared them, but they still loved the area.  We had a good time.  Now back to the regularly posting schedule...
