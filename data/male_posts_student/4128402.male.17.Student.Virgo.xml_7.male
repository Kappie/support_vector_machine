My results were alright it must be said, especially seeing as the amount of time and effort i out in this year.  Adv English C, Modies A (gasps!), Info Systems B and Psychology B (yet more, louder gasps, almost could be described as a guffaw). Quite chuffed, it seems that most people this year did 'ok' in their exams, except Cooney who as always bends the exams over and gives them it royally from the rear.  Some people narrowly missed out on what they needed but will still get into Uni through clearences, so its all good really, the posse will not be beaten just yet! So the last thing tying me to high school is over and im now completely done and my days as a Newman Punter have ceased to be. Ahh tis a sorrowful day indeed, i didnt enjoy being at school by no means (well the final year anyway, previous years were ok, 4th was alright etc) but i dont adapt well to change and this is one of the biggest iv faced, the move from high school to university, it wont be pretty i tell you.  Ive also made a drastic decision as regards my dilemma of whether or not to go for that job interview: no suprises here when you learn that i pussied out of it as always. But i had solid reasons for not going for this job, as it will most likey interfere with Uni more than i would be able to handle and the job itself is mince, not my cup of Lapsang Souchong.  So Scotmid it is then, but i really do need a new job soon, i hate that place, its fucking pish and several of my co-workers (and customers, oh the dreaded customers) are little shits or else just annoy me by being themselves (ie wankers). I'll just look for something a little closer to home and a little more applicable to my shakey list of attributes.  Good luck finding that right? Bye then.
