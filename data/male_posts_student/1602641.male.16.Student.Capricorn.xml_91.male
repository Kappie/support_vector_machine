I can't remember what it was exactly, and was probably so nervous that I butchered it beyond comprehension anyway. Still, it will without a doubt go down as one of those key moments in my life, one that I will look back on wistfully when I am in need of inspiration or motivation. *Sigh*... It was so beautiful. How I wish he were still the president.  And more exciting news - I got the mustard stains out of my t-shirt! Thank you, Clorox pen!
