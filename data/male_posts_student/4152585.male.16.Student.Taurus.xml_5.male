They have formed a group called   Swift Boat Veterans For Truth  . They are doing their best to get out what they knew and saw of John Kerry during his service in Vietnam including running   a television ad   and writing a forthcoming book titled "  Unfit For Command  ".      But rather than   answering the shocking alegations of killings and the torching of villiages by their candidate   the Kerry camp is attacking the funding of the group. They have been screaming that the Swift Boat Veterans For Truth is funded by   a wealthy Republican supporter from Texas  .  Oh the humanity!  Of course they forget that their attack dogs, Moveon.org and others who   like to portray President Bush as Hitler   are   supported by a wealthy Democrat supporter, George Soros  .        It's obvious that the Democrats can't take their own medicine so my advice to them since they hitched their cart to someone who wants to use his four months in Vietnam as his campaign cornerstone is to sit down and shut up. If you're going to dish it out you better be prepared to take it.
