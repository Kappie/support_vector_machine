Then, karate from seven till nine. That makes for a full day. Work... well what can I say about work... Oh I know... Manure SMELLS. Don't ask.  Driving was actually fun, and I seem to be catching on really fast. I got to do just about everything but the traffic circle. Went on the highway, all around, parrallel parking. The whole deal. They need to make those darned Japanese cars bigger though.  Karate was awesome! Me and a few other people got to do weapons in the backyard, we went through the bo staff. That was quite fun, and I got to demonstrate pinan shodan for the class. I nailed that kata, especially at the end. Sensei was actually quite impressed with my explosions of movement, just need to work on the first couple moves and I've got a tournament kata. I managed to achieve that feeling of being in a dream I talked about yesterday for the period of that kata. Superb, wish I could get it like that all the time.  Petal to the Metal is an song from the soundtrack to the Italian Job, it is quite awesome, I reccomend listening to it sometime. Soon as I get my drivers, this is gonna be blaring on the speakers most likely. That, along with a buncha Iron Maiden and Hammerfall.  Tommorow looks promising for doing stuff, I work five till ten and for once have no other plans.  That seems to bring a close to my blogg for today, no thoughts have been weighing me down, for I have been flying free all day.  D
