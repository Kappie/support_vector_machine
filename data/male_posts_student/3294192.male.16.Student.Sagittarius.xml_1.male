It's true. Try to sing along!   "He finds it's hard to speak,   "I, am thinking it's a sign,   in his own room for weeks,   that the freckles in our eyes,   his bed's the eastern front,   are mirror images,   when fighting off disease.   and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned."   Sit straight up, don't stare."   That last line still makes no rhythm though. God, I wish I could make beats as hot as the Postal Service's. I wonder how they do it, probably with some awesome old-school piece of hardware I'll never see. Where's the beatmachine for the common man? I need my beatz!  Actually, me (and  urlLink Guy ) like to use the  urlLink Hammerhead Beat Machine , and I've started looking at  urlLink Drumbox 1.0 . It's great because it allows you to easily make samples from  any  .WAV file. I can't wait to make a drum track that says "Snare snare snare snare bass BASS bass sna- bass tom tom ta-tom tom cyabaaaaallll." I've also heard good things about  urlLink Fruityloops , but I'm to cheap to pay and too lazy to kazaa. Take  THAT  Fruityloops! So I'll keep on working with these two   FREE   beaters. If anybody knows of any other share-ware/free-ware beat machine emulators, let me know. I'm all about that.
