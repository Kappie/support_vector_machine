It elicited the kind of imagery that would define a cruel inhuman existence where injustice ruled the day.  But now the term “terrorism” means something else, and to be honest it is getting kind of fruity.  Vernon Robinson, the new Jesse Helms, called a group of gay activists “Terrorists” in his personal statement on his campaign website.  The pro-lifers have begun to call women’s health clinic employees “Terrorists.”  The Patriot Act helps the government find “Terrorists” by accessing library records, because the “Terrorists” are apparently attempting to seed their hateful propaganda in the seemingly innocent covers of your child’s favorite Dr. Seuss book.  The government stops old ladies in wheelchairs at airports because they might be “Terrorists.”  Look, if the terrorists are hiring old ladies to blow up airplanes, then…they deserve to win.  The term “Terrorism” no longer holds the context of fear that it probably should, and the only people that are really scaring me anymore are the leaders of this country who come out at least once a week to tell me that the “Terrorists” are everywhere and will kill me when they get the chance. You cannot live your life in fear, because your fear gives other people power, and the more fear that Ashcroft, Ridge, and Bush spread, the more power they have.
