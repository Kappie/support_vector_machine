Some people are sleeping! It's summer. That's what we're supposed to do during summer break: sit in a chair for 12 straight hours and sleep for 12 straight hours. It's life.  I woke up and watched the demolition anyway. I even felt sonic vibrations like an earthquake at one point.  When the house went down, I went straight to sleep. That didn't last long.  At 9:30 I had to wake up for an orthodontist appointment. I broke four brackets on my braces and needed them fixed. 9:30am? Why not 2:30pm when I'm awake?  So much time, so little sleep.
