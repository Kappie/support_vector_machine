That being said, welcome back.  I was a lazy bum today. "Come now Dave, you must have done something!"  Well, yes I did. Firstly, I SLEPT IN. It was vigorous, let me tell you. I was having some crazy dreams, probably due to the lack of sleep I had the previous night (that would be Saturday into Sunday), but I was roused by an old classmate for some homework advice. Off I went into the pounding rain to deliver some crucial, life-altering notes, and I even had time to stop at the mall in order to acquire a lunch...a lunch lovingly prepared by the wonderful employees of Salad Works...(drool)  Then, it was back home for some exceptionally productive and mind-expanding academic pursuits. For you french-speaking audience members, that means I sat down and watched four straight episodes of Angel on DVD. I had a striking realization after watching them too, and not the kind of "Boy, I should get off my ass and do something far more enriching than this" realization, either. When I got up and went to my room, i couldn't help but empathize and identify with Angel's current plight.   See, where I am currently at in watching the series, our hero Angel is downtrodden. He's heartbroken, defeated, rejected by loved ones and disregarding his friends. He's allowing the darkness to really creep into him, and not truly caring about the consequences. He's almost given up completely, and even when he fights, he does so recklessly. He's making mistakes and stumbling, and he's giving up hope that he ever had any idea about who he was meant to be in the end. So Angel?  I salute you. Here's to you coming out of your spell, and me coming out of mine. Hey...come to think of it, maybe if there's some kind of twisted significance to this parallel, perhaps I could just accelerate the arrival of better times by just watching a bunch more episodes of Angel! What do you think?! Wait, there are better times to come for Angel, right? RIGHT?!?!?!  (looking around nervously, and then bounding down the stairs toward the DVD player)
