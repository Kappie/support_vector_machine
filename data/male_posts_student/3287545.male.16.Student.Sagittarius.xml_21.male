It was in science, and Laura asked me that question, “Jonathon, are you gay?” I didn’t give an actually answer, but said “that’s an awkward question”. Which basically meant YES. So, gemma heard as well, which was really cool. And then Laura passed it to other Laura and Heather heard. So, that’s four people who hopefully now think I’m gay. After Laura asked me I was so embarrised, I said something like “I’m going all red now”. Then sir started talking so we had to quieten down. I was shaking and my heart was beating so fast while I sat writing stuff down trying to avoid making eye-contact. Once he finished other Laura (Laura K) said “I don’t think your gay”. I responded with “Why not?”. Gemma was really nice about it. She was telling the others to stop going on about it and that, and when we were leaving class she said, just ignor Laura B, or something to that effect, which was so nice of her. I want to be her GBF. Although it was really hard, it felt soooooo fantastic. I’m really looking forward tomorrow, business studies first lesson, and who’s in my class, only, GEMMA. So, I’m hoping we might have some little ‘chat’. Where I could climb further out the closet. Gemma is the one, she’s the one I want to tell everything to. At launch, I once again ended up outside the main gang. I tried to sit in the middle area in the hope I would be closer to the centre, but the circle ended up forming in the wrong place. I’m hopeing after today, more of the ladies will want to sit nearer to me. I always seem to end up slightly on the outside, and the only person I can speak to is Katie, which isn’t great.
