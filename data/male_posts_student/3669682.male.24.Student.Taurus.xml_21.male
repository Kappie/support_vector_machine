I'm going to get paid $9,50 to stand behind the photo counter, have people bring me their films to get developped, and give them their pictures back once it's done.   Keep in mind, $9,50 is what I was getting paid LAST at Compucentre, after 4 years and being Assistant-Manager. So, same pay, none of the responsibilities. Schweet.   But I always feel awkward saying 'I quit'. I always feel bad about it, even if I'm working for a big corporation that really couldn't care less about me. Today isn't going to be fun.
