Today has been a day of news my aunt from tampico alongside her family are comimg to visit on the 25th, for 3 day's of sight seeing, and shooping, which should be fun if, my room wasn't before time offered as a welcomiming for them to sleep in, they won't get much sleep there are birds and insects who sing and croak outside my window every other night. SO again to the seeing and shooping this will be another good excuse to drive to katy mall and blow our money, hehe. So yesterday in due to my insomnia i saw the most interesting short story called evelyn the cuttest evil dead girl, it's avery interesting gothic twist about the age old long story of tryin to fit in somewhere and making friends, even though it was 6 minutes long it was still interesting. Anyhow I think im getting i'm getting a cold, which is a real drag. : (
