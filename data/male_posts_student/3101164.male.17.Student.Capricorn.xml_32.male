Z is still tryin to figure out how.  i was mainly pissed because i thought i was the only one who saw something wrong in what L was doin.  But i found out today that Z and P care as well.  Whats worse is that no matter what happens someone is gonna get hurt.  and that is so depressing.  this is too much goddamn pressure on my back.  it is pushing me lower and lower and lower and lower  untill eventually i cant get any lower and i just snap.  now i dont know what snap means for all i know it will mean that i will get and ulcer.  but who knows all i know is that this shit is tearin me up inside. whats worse R doesnt even know.  this may not make sense to anyone but those who know what i am talkin about may perhaps understand.  >>
