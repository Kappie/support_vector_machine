Anyone can change the following things: Template(little thing at the bottom of each post), Description, and the Copyright thing on the side. It doesn't have to stay a copyright Details: Any of the above things may only be changed if the current setting has been there for a week(seven [7] days or more) or after fifteen (15) or more posts, no more than three per person.  Exceptions made for blog member birthdays and other special occasions.  sound good? oh, and maybe another unofficial rule, could we keep the templates to 1 or 2 lines in length? they get annoying to read when they're too long. This car belongs to the evil Dr. Stegman, who parks in spots that don't belong to him and finds Andrew McCarthy to be petulant and oddly short.
