Really to see triple h loses.  Here are the Results:     Triple H defeats Shawn Michaels     Chris Benoit def. Kane     Trish Stratus def. Lita, Victoria and Gail Kim (pinning Lita)     Randy Orton def. Shelton Benjamin     Chris Jericho def. Tyson Tomko     Eugene def. Jonathan Coachman     La Resistance def. Chris Benoit and Edge (DQ)  Oh well.. so far Bad blood was quite ok.. Just feeling dissapointed about HBK losing the match.. I find it unfair. Oh well just hope dat HBK will one day defeat HHH.  In the afternoon: Oh well.. its HOT!! especially room were there's no shading.. Its really quite hot man. I planned to study for my ASEAN test this 29th June at Maktab Duli. Argh!! Stress During the holiday  watever!!  hahaha.. Wat annoys me dis afternoon was my siste's frend came and made so much noise...!! Sheeesh..  Evening: Nothing much happen.. watch tv! Continue study aahaha.. AT LAST i've finished one chapter of the ASEAN topic.. hehe which was a relief actually.. :) now another few to go!! Which i'll start a new topic tomorrow.   Come to think of it, i tot today was Tuesday.. hehe i was practically excited to watch wwe raw.. Dah... Finally realised that today was still MONDAY! hehe    And just few hours ago, me and the president of student council decided to cancel this cleaning campaign and pick another suitable day and time (Tomorow Morning @ 10 a.m) for the Student Council's Room that we just been given.. But there dis one guys this disapprove and told me that i made him sick..??!!!for making such a stupid decision.. wat the hell??
