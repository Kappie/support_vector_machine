(Outkast- I like the way you move) well for the past day and on the way to the dance all i heard about was how amber hasn't danced in like 3 years. as the night kept goin i realized this was a load of poop. she was a really sweet date though. so after the dance the 4 of us said bye to everyone and made our way to dinner. one problem... where would we be going for dinner? so after going to rockne's in solon, damon's in twinsburg, and a couple others we finally found applebee's in macedonia to be the only one open (except denny's which all of us are sick of). my date from last year, allison waple, was up there. i think she was trying to order a 1/2 pound or 1/3 pound of a burger (lol hilarious inside joke. ask if you need an explanation.) after i ordered a cowboy burger i was taunted with "yee haw" and "giddy up" by mitch. i must admit it was funny.   so that just about how my night went. good friends, awesome date, lucky guy.
