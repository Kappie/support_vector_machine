After the Angels game I got really bored as hell and started messing around with some old Star Wars crap.  I got creative...Alittle  too  creative...  Anyways you'll get to see sooner or later, when nothings going on in my life.  I saw the most awsomest shirt today!  It had Strongbad on it!  YESSS!  Ohh beware because Strongbad owns j00.  And the Angels game totally sucked major balls.  I could not believe I dragged myself out for that.  The only reason I went to that gay-ass game was to get my free subway Food from my parents.  The sandwich even blew kinda!  WTF?!  I'm probably ordering pizza tonight, frikken bored as hell.  I was talking to my much awsome friend, but she went to go work on her site.  I added the "Random Picture of the Week" too.  It just shows crappy pictures I think are funny week to week.  Oh yah, Happy Father's Day to all you dads out there.  From the teen-pregnancy screw-ups to the really old geezer dads, have a great day.  My sister's using nail-polish remover....it smells funny.  Yet oh-so-satisfing.....::falls out uncounsious from huffing nailpolish remover::....ugggggghhh.
