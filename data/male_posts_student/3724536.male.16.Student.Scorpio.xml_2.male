Todays paper was science and accounts objective paper. almost had a big drama when someone got caught for cheating, lucky for her she managed to talk her way out of it - to lim yoke kheng of all teachers. Personally my own science paper was a flop.. didnt study much the day before since i was busy with this blog, and when i finally got round to studying i fell asleep till dinner time. Siigh just goes to show how great i am at studying...  But even though it's the weekend i cant relax yet, im speaking in church on sunday and i havnt even prepared my sermon. To make matters worse its supposed to be a discussion so im supposed to discuss my points with my friend. Well i guess ill be doing another rush job as always.. cant say im proud of it though. I know i should be paying even more attention to that than my studies but when theres no mood to do it, there is really no mood to do it....  On a more happier note, i must say that slowly but surely im getting the hang of this blog, although im doing it mostly by copying from other ppl's blog..(sorry Robyn~!!) hopefully ill be able to get a few pics in soon and also add a msg box or somethin...
