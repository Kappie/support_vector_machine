(Marten and I will be in Vincennes--Thomas) It's the day that school ends, ergo it's a half day, and we're going to need extra time for all these movies anyway. So edit your choices for movies in here below.  RESTRICTIONS are ars follows:  *NO MUSICALS! (We're having a seperate JournalCon for them. So don't bring one.) *Nothing over 140 minutes in length.  * NOTHING ON VHS!  DVD ONLY.  This is an absolute must.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Pick Your Movies.  Erin:   Sophia:   Marten:  The Adventures of Baron Munchausen  Michael:  Lost In Translation  Jonah:  Galaxy Quest  Nathan: If Erin chooses Love Actually, I choose Episode II  Rachel:   Thomas:  Ferris Bueller's Day Off  Paul:  Dr. No  Tyler:   You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.
