I also have to work, so I probably won't get to do it til tonight. oh well, shyte happens.    on a lighter note, I got to spend 5 straight hours with Ariel yesterday. that was awesome. we went to church, then lunch then just hung out at the mall for awhile. then I went out and did some stuff with some friends and called her up when I got home.    oh well, good things happen and bad things happen, I guess it all comes down to how you handle them. don't ask me what that means, cuz I couldn't tell you. it just sounded cool in my head...
