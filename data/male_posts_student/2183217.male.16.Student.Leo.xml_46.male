In grade 6 or 7 me and Lindz started noticing a middle aged chink always washing her dishes in her kitchen. Lindz got out her binoculars and we spied on her for a while. Knowing nothing about drugs, we then made the educated guess that she was constantly MAKING drugs in her kitchen , and then on became known as "The Lady Who Makes Drugs" . Or sometimes just " the lady" .  Anyways , we decided to take it upon ourselves to punish this criminal and start shooting pizza crusts in her yard for our amusement. Sometimes friends would come over and join us. One thing led to another and the more snow came the more food we shot. At one point we had tomatos, bananas, eggs, bagels, Pizza Begals, Pizza Slices, Hotdogs, Unidentified Rotten food of any sort , Apples, cheese and peices of cake in there all at once because the snow kept piling up and she wouldn't notice until spring. One day , we had the bright idea of making what we like to call , a Creation. Creations consist of a coke bottle full of the nastiest food you can find, such as nasty cheese, oregano and other bad spices, eggs, mayonaise ( anything that will rot) , fruits, cereal, BAGEL BITES and other things that made it have a puke-like texture... anyways we fill a 2L coke bottle with shit until it smells extremly nasty. We also filled two ziplock baggies up with this creation and went out into the back yard. We launched the coke bottle and the 2 baggies and fell in the snow laughing before running back into the house. When spring came the lady must've had a great suprise, and also lindz grandma , considering we missed her yard a lot of the time.  Other times we would take out our Laser Pointers on boring Saturday nights and point them at the lady, one at her wall and the other one in her eye... She would then do one of two things, 1) duck under the counter or 2) look at us... If she looked at us lindz would usually pick up a kitchen knife at point it to her window in a threatening manner, when the lady ran away we would laugh and go back to playing Nintendo.   So yeah , this has been going on for about... 4 years now, and we still shoot the occasional food in her yard but we aren't AS interested. Until last weekend that is.We were devestated to notice the tree in her yard had been cut down. Assuming she moved  , we looked in her window, and noticed what appeared to be a new woman! We instantly pulled out the frozen chicken nuggets and started drawing swastikas on them with a black marker and launching them into her yard like there was no tomorrow. Then we noticed ... our eyes had deceived us... It was still the lady who made drugs... OOOO YEA!
