I was mediocre, I got a 101,122, and 147. After that I went to work, we had a daycare today. They behaved ok, better than normal. after work I stayed and swam with friends. After that I came home, took a shower, ate pizza for dinner and now I'm on here. Now I gotta go outside and put H2O in the birdbath. Have a great day. Love, Carson
