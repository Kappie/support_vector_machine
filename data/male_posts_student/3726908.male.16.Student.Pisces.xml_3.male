It seems Karean has got there 2 weeks ago and had been discovered by the people of the Sen Arashi manor; hence she began to get accustomed to the life there. Strangely, the chief of Sen Arashi sect ranked Karean with quite a high rank once she got in, she was even given a secret room and had servants under her.   Tai Wu, “Haha, it seemed that you have a charmed life. Lucky you.”   Karean, “Well…I don’t really know is it luck or so…”   Tai Wu, “Why?”   Karean, “It was as if the chief is using me…she taught me skills and techniques…chose targets who seem totally innocent and commands me to assassinate them.”   Tai Wu, “Hmm…”   Karean, “What do you think? Is this master of mine really reliable?”   Tai Wu, “I can’t be sure…”   Hearing this, Karean purred her mouth a little and knocked lightly on Tai Wu’s head shortly.   Karean, “Hah, well…stop thinking of all this serious topics, you wanna have a bath?”   Tai Wu, “Bath?!”   Karean moved over to Tai Wu and began sniffing at him like a dog, soon complaining, “Smell yourself! After all this is a lady’s room mind you, I won’t like my room to be filled with the stench of a man who hadn’t bathed in days!”   Tai Wu rebutted back with a hitch of reluctance, “But…I don’t have any clothes nor is there a bathroom in this room of yours.”   Karean, “Oh yeah, forgot to tell you…outside this room and in the right side of the tunnel is a spring, water there is clean and portable. Then when you’re done, just knock on my door. Ignore the scarecrow…it’ll fix itself.”   Tai Wu, “A scarecrow can fix itself?”  Karean, “It’s made of a special metal which has the properties to attach itself back to its broken part…just like water. It’s very hard and only Sen Arashi’s fatal kill; Dai Kai Sen has the power to destroy it.”   Tai Wu, “…this world just baffles me…”   Karean, “Ok, don’t just stand there, go bath.” She proceeds over to the door and opened it, eyes staring at Tai Wu hinting him to get out. Reluctantly, Tai Wu went for the shower.   Walking in the dark, Tai Wu’s eyes gradually grown used to it…sighting the spring, Tai Wu undressed and soaked himself in it. Coincidentally or purposely, the spring is just of the right size. The water is cooling and relaxing, soothing of all the tiredness and worries, Tai Wu for once can let his mind off. He glanced over the bulk of his body, raw wounds and scars have increased in number, the few weeks of traveling in his hometown after his parents death had forced him to grow up…no more of the well-lived life and no more of the leisure he had experienced.   Tai Wu, “All this is just too strange…what exactly is this world? Why am I here? What’s the purpose in all these…and why did the man said I would find out the answers to all my questions here? I have more questions now instead of answers!”   Suddenly, footsteps and voice can be heard spreading through the tunnel,” Missy! Is that you?”   Tai Wu was alarmed, someone had found the entrance to this place, “That’s not good, I thought only Karean can enter?”   ???, “Missy? Please reply!”   Tai Wu remained silent, slowly he got out of the bath and dressed himself, creeping towards the giant door.   ???, “If you don’t reply, I’ll proceed forward!”   Tai Wu thought, “Not good…” Frantically, Tai Wu knocked the door…however there were no answers.   Tai Wu thought, “This is seriously not good!”   ???, “Missy?! Is that you? I’m coming forward now.”   Abruptly, a voice emits from the door…Karean’s voice, “If you move just one more step closer! I’ll accuse you of molest! By that time prepare to get the punishment from Master!”   The man stopped…seemingly relieve at hearing Karean’s voice, “Sorry for my intrusion, but I brought your dinner here…I didn’t know you are taking a bath.”   Karean, “Just leave the food there…I’ll get to it when I’m done.”   ???, “Yes…Karean-sama”   A small tap sound is heard…continued by footsteps. Finally, the door exposed its entrance and let Tai Wu in. Karean is just wearing a light pink nightdress, which seems translucent under the light, the figure of her seductive body much apparent now. Tai Wu blushed again…   Noticing the redness of Tai Wu face, Karean turned back, “Don’t look at me now! Turn back!”   Tai Wu, “Ye…Yes!!!” Immediately he turned back.   After some time…Karean spoke, “Alright, you can turn over now.”   Slowly shifting himself, Tai Wu took a glance at Karean…she’s back in her previous dark green ninja suit.   Tai Wu, “Phew…Ok, Why is it that the door can be opened by somebody else?”   Karean, “That guy is one of my servant and bodyguard, he seem to have gotten wary that I snick off last night…”   ???, “So, you did snick off yesterday night…and the night before!”   Shocked, Tai Wu and Karean turned their heads over to the door which is now open…a man is standing there bent down a little, right arm raised perpendicular and the forearm ninety degree as well, left hand is totally stretched straight forward.   Karean, “This stance!!”   Tai Wu, “Isn’t this Sen Arashi’s…”   ???, “Prepare yourself stranger! Sen Arashi! Dai Kai Sen!”
