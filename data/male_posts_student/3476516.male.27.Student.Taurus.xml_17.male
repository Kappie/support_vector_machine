 Here is a interesting site, a nice looking smart women with a nice singing voice. You can listen to the music, most of it is not bad, she could improve a little on the vocals by being a little stronger. In my opinon she is holding back, and all she needs to do is let loose a little more. Electric music is not my style of music, but I still enjoy some of the songs.
