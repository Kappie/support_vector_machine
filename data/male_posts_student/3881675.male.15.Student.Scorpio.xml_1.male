PROJECT MOTHERSHIP:  To keep it simple, me and jonny have drafted a plan for what the abnd should do next summer (plus jonny himself who is the geek and co-producer). we plan on going to the city of angels and book a weeks recording seesion at the Mothership Studios in Hollywood. But check this out...it costs 4000 pounds for a weeks accomommodation for 4 people in a fucking amazing house next to the studio and 12 hours of studio time every day. now for 4 grand that is cheap. so all we have to do now is raise some cash by doing some gigs and selling some CDs etc...then we can go and record our debut album at one of the most famous and most hardcore studios in the world (SLASH has recorded there before). I still need to run this by james and alex but they should say yes just because it'll be such great fun and a properly hardcore experience as well.   ha...jonny said to me the other day he had written a very long blog...amateur...
