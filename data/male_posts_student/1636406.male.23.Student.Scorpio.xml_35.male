I really had some mixed reactions. I have only been gone for a year, and it's like a whole world appeared in what was once farm-land.  When I was little my grandparents would take me to feed horses there... it just was so strange to see that all disappear and be replaced with houses and roads. It's so depressing.  I'm not sure if what I am feeling is natural or the result of a really tough day at work.  So lately all I do is work and rip cds-- My CD collection is so pathetically small I am scrounging to find cds to rip.  I can't wait till I go back to school.
