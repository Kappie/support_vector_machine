Had been a emotional weekend for me coz, i cried at the funeral especially when the band played "Shi Shang Zhi You Ma Ma Hao" and "What a friend we have in Jesus". Too many things has happened in 1 shot and I am wondering if I should take a break from church work for a while to reorganise myself both emotionally and to evaluate my spiritual life. Too much things has happened and I feel it is time to take a break i guess. Ah well, I also dun feel like toking much now so I guess, I will stop here.
