These predictions are simply what I think will win, not necessarily what I want to win. I have omitted some of the categories that I have absolutely no idea about to lighten the load.    Best Drama   Mystic River   [Lost]         Best Actress in a Drama   Charlize Theron - Monster   [Won]    Best Actor in Drama   Sean Penn - Mystic River   [Won]    Best Musical or Comedy   Lost In Translation   [Won]    Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy   Scarlett Johansson - Lost In Translation   [Lost]    Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy   Bill Murray - Lost In Translation   [Won]    Best Supporting Actress   Hope Davis - American Splendor   [Lost]    Best Supporting Actor   Tim Robins - Mystic River   [Won]    Best Director   Peter Jackson - The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King   [Won]    Best Screenplay   Jim Sheridan - In America   [Lost]    Best Television Drama   Nip/Tuck   [Lost]    Best Television Musical or Comedy   Monk   [Lost]    Best Actor in a Television Musical or Comedy   Tony Shaloub - Monk   [Lost]   The Golden Globes will air tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m. Central on NBC.   UPDATE: I was way off!   Well, as you can see above, I didn't do too well with my predictions.  I went 6 for 13 overall in the categories that I made predictions for. Next year I will try to actually see most of the movies and television shows that are nominated before making predictions.    urlLink Golden Globe awards winners 2004
