Bryce was off at 5, and I was supposed to be off at 6, so I just left and 5 with Bryce. For a while, we just hung around the malls. I went and showed him how much better the other RadioShack is. Then, back at Bower Mall, I seen Shayna. I think she looks really different, but she still looks good. Hm. It was just kind of a "hey" in passing type thing. After she walked by I decided I should have asked her to come out with us, but, alas, it was too late, she was already down the hallway. Good times with that girl...sort of. I guess as good as a 15 year old can have. It was really bizarre to see her, because I had just ran an internet search on her a few days before. Now, don't think I'm going all stalker, I've just been thinking a lot lately about people and where they've ended up, and I know if you type my name into Google, you will find me very easily. I was simply seeing if perhaps a few people from days long dead may also be found as easily. They are not. Although I did find this photo.    The girl with the cow on the left is Sonja Hehli. Ha. Neat.  At any rate. Then Bryce and I decided to go to the pawn shop and get some money. So we pawned a voice recorder and a discman. We got 25 bucks and it's gonna cost 31 to get it all back. That's not really that bad. After a meal at McDonalds, we went on a quest to find skull shaped cup holders for my car. We failed miserably.  As the evening progressed, we ended up back at Jamie's house (Bryce's girlfriend). Her cat is really cute. It's still a kitten so it's all small and playful. Bryce and almost fit it's head in his mouth. Then blah blah blah, headed to Billy Bob's. I love that place so much. I gave everyone a speech on the perils of chocolate cake and opening the fridge... meh. Bramley's, beach night, bikini contest, slutty chicks, blah blah blah.    teach me to be happy, teach me to love again. My heart may be in other places right now, but with love you can move a mountain, so why not a heart?
