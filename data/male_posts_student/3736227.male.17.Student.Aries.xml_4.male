I really do love all my friends, but sometimes I worry that they will turn on me, or i them. I don't want this to happen.   Anyway, Brian and I cuddled for like a half hour, and it was gret...it was naked...lol. I loved it...  Joel has agreed to pay me $50 for cleaning the floors of the other house. I am so happy. And tommorow, I am going to start on the other one. I might stop and do the rest on thursdya, just to make him think it's harder, that way, I can get more money:) j/k. Joel is smart and knows how much something is worth. Thats one reason why I like him. He is good for my mom.   Sara and I have been talking lately, and no matter how many times I tell her Nick is good for her, she still is amazed, because I never liked nick before. It's not that I didn't like hiim, but I am very protective of sara. I don't want her to end up with the wrong guy, and get burt. I did that before to her, and I was wrong.  But, I am going to go to bed...ttyl
