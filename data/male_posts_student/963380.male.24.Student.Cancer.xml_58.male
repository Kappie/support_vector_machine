Admittedly the chap I almost hit was speeding and weaving - hence me not noticing him, but it still doesn't excuse me from double checking my blind spot. As my mother says "you little fucking bastard, I'll kill you."  Oh.  Sorry, she also used to say "It's not you on the road I worry about, it's all the other idiots." Dangle that participle.  Got groceries today. 100% less dying involved when you eat.  Work today was good. Met with Steve. Sometimes I really can't tell whether I'm going to get promoted or not in this job. I should probably sit down with Tyson and go over what to do and what to say. I have trouble bonding with the managers sometimes simply because I'm not the person they want me to be. I don't drink, I don't smoke and I don't really give a damn about professional sports. I'm a hell of a talker, but I think I have trouble giving a shit about irrelevant things. Mother always told me having depth would fuck me up later in life. Well, she didn't really, but it makes me laugh to think she might have.  I've officially changed my stance on pierced noses. The rings make people look stupid. The studs are adorable. On girls. Guys, why the fuck are you putting things through your noses? Leave that to the girls, you don't need to add cute to yourself or anything. Go wrestle.  Zoolander's a funny film. I can see how it's an aquired taste though. I just keep picturing Ben Stiller as Tom Cruise and I fucking die laughing. The two of them desperately need to do a film together.  I thought I'd come up with a cure for stupidity, but it turned out to be merely a recipe for a sundae. Fuck it.
