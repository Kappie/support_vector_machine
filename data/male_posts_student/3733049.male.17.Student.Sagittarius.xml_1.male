However, as my eager eyes gazed into the kitchen with anxious intent I suddenly came to a realization that I had not come to before…what I was actually about to do! I looked at the uncooked hamburger meat, redder than the Japanese sun, and the fries that were swathed in salt as to distract the consumer from their burnt texture. Before I lost all appetite I looked to the grill hoping that the sight of a dark brown lump of flavor would once again put me in a state of anticipation. My hopes were slashed once I saw the sea of grease and liquidated fat that surrounded each island of a burger. By the time I reached the top of the line, pizza became much more appetizing option. I left that McDonalds with more than just a grilled chicken sandwich( a decision contrived through an internal compromise) but a dismayed attitude towards the fast food industry.  	 In 1954 two brothers, Dick and Maurice, created the first fast food service in their now famous restaurant, McDonald’s. The idea was simple and effective based on economic intangible of supply and demand; produce delectable food quickly. However, now 50 years later McDonald’s is a global success yet the quality that had been an integral part of this institution has drastically diminished with the passing of time. It is apparent that their tradition of success has made them more bold. That because they have hit the ceiling of success in becoming an international icon the only way to generate a greater profit was to cut the costs in quality. Corporation leaders were banking on the idea that convenience and past rapport would draw consumers…they could not have been more correct. Though the health risks of eating McDonald’s food is so high that it has become almost humorous the general public still delve into it’s fatty depths. It seems that McDonald’s could start advertising a monkey-meat burger but as long as it is served with fries and a coke at a value price droves of salivating consumers will flock out of habit.  	 The fast food industry has become a twisted shadow of what it once was. Quality and true value have been stomped out by unrelenting ambition and greed. Jean Michel Chapereau gives his outlook on the fast food service saying: 	 We were taken to a fast food café where our order was fed into a computer. Our hamburger, made from the flesh of chemically impregnated cattle, had been broiled over countefeit charcoal, placed between slices of artificialy flavored cardboard and served to us by recycled juvenile delinquents . (Chaperau, Un Hiver Americain)  This, sadly, has become a universal experience for a majority of the world. Unless something is done to stop this subtle genocide the only ones who will benefit are McDonalds executives, heart surgeons, and the funeral homes.
