I don't know how much more of this I can take. I feel completely worn out, yet my heart is constantly beating like crazy. My dad said it's because of the wellbutrin. He doesn't want me taking this shit because his co-worker's boyfriend died of a heartattack while on it. All I gotta say is that it sucks. My heart is racing 24/7, and it's beating so damn hard that it actually prevents me from falling asleep. I'm guessing this extreme fatigue is also due to the meds..my body's feeling so completely worn out that it's actually a bitch to just walk down the stairs. This isn't cool. Maybe if I drag my ass to the gym later I can get hyped up enough to actually workout. I swear the second I walk into that place I always get completely amped and energized, no matter how shitty or tired I was feeling before. We'll see. If I can just make it down the fucking stairs..      I ended up staying in last night because I was just too damn tired to go out by the time I got ahold of Eva. Sorry Eva..oh and I still think you're full of shit. Ok so she  claims  she was born and partially raised in the same Chicago suburb as me. No one I've talked to has ever heard of Glendale Heights, yet she expects me to believe we were both living in the same city at the same time? Yeaaaa ok. I think someone needs to put the pipe down and step away from the bong. heheh      What the fuck am I doing today? Oh yea..Jon's coming back today so I think we're all having dinner later. Maybe watch a movie or something afterwards. Jon's a real cool guy, cheek-pinching fetish and all. I wonder what bitsy's up to..I swear she better not have shat on the carpet again. Bad kitty. She's so fucking spoiled it's no wonder she's constantly whining whenever she doesn't get all the attention. Seriously she won't shut up once she starts whining and meowing. I wish she had an on/off switch. That would be fucking badass.      Oh yea, I had a dream that this guy I went to highschool with accused me of having a mullet. What a prick.
