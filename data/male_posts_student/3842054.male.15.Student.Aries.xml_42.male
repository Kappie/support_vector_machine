Ok, well, what happened today... Um, I get to babysit Katies cat for money. And so continue the never ending chronicles of the ADVENTURES OF BOBBY SEIFTER!!!! Today, our masked hero realizes he doesnt have any special powers, but he can make a mean grilled cheese sandwich. Ok Joan Rivers, stop with the small talk bullshit.... (Sorry, im talking to myself again)  Yeah, no  one is going to be on tour in Florida for a while, and im pissed. BUt i am also confused because Sugarcult has not been on their palm trees and powerlines tour yet... unless they count that as warped tour... They better be here, cuz im gonna be all up in dat shit... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA... no.  Um, tommorow im going to a Marlins game... if i had a party popper, I wouldnt pop it. Its going to be hot, and tehy are going to be losing and im going to get mad and threaten the lives of one of the players only to be yelled at by my mom because "Good fans always support their teams not matter what." If you have a mom that knows what a double-play is,  you get scolded about stupid shit like that. Well, lyrics... um, i havent decided yet but ill think of something... Dashboard... no, Switchfoot... no,  Sugarcult... no, SoCo... no, TJT... no, YELLOWCARD! Havent posted lyrics from them in a while... ok, how about an oldy that i listened to today...  Underdog                                            I absolutely do not relate to this song, but it is catchy.  Yellowcard   One more trip down  To the lost and found  To find your heart  That the quarterback punk               Is it possible to walk to the lost and found if your heart was   Dropped on the ground                      actually ripped physically out of your chest?            One more trip down  To the lost and found  To find your heart   Left out  The one they picked last  For the big ball game Beat up after class                                     Do they still do that?   No doubt  Showed up one day  You were not the same  You won't be the last one anymore   One long walk down  Through the hallway now  You're finding out  That you don't fit in this time around  One long walk down  Through the hallway now  You feel left out   Left out  The one they picked last  For the big ball game  Beat up after class  No doubt  Showed up one day  You were not the same  You won't be the last one anymore   Left out  The one they picked last  For the big ball game  Beat up after class  No doubt  Showed up one day  You were not the same  You won't be the last one anymore  Wooooo                                                            Greatest lyric ever written with the point of a pen    Left out  The one they picked last  For the big ball game  Beat up after class  No doubt  Showed up one day  You were not the same  You won't be the last one
