So it turns out one of these projects is a gc, which i might add must be the funnest projects to do ever in the history of school. anyways in my venture of filming this gc, there was a certain scene to pull of MIB style kick in door scenes as seen in the aforementioned movies. anthony graciously volunteered his house for this scene and basically the whole gc (maybe cuz his house has never been used b4 as opposed to my house which has been in 2 or 3 videos.  anyways, in our little venture of kicking in doors, yours truly might have kicked the door too hard (i must have MIB blood within me) and punched a hole in the inside wall with the door handle. hehe it'll be in the gc bloopers, to my embarrassment i guess. so now anthony's parents are rightfully really pissed at me and want me to fix and/or repair the whole that i have so artfully crafted into the architecture of his house. though i must say splitting the cost with my gc group would be mighty nice, i mean i did do it for the better of our grades right? so yea...  besides all of this madness i still got a bean trees project, history project, french final, trig/pre-cal final, comp tech final, and chem final b4 the close of the school year. so this should be fun, see if i'll indeed end up in band or if i'll just end up working out at the gym or whatever during summer becuz i'd have nothing better to do (like tami evnin the x-colorguard). so yea...fun stuff this year is winding up to become...
