So hopefully this new episode will b much "brighter" than the last one...but one of the story linez still stayz the same that continued unto this one...im still gunnin for that CIF Chamipionship, right now we're ranked 2nd in our division, so i want to b 1st and i want to win sooooooo bad, its probly the only thing on my mind cuz im tryin to get all that other shit out of my mind...so yeah...the saga episode 2 beginz...   urlLink Hit The Floor...this song sayz it all
