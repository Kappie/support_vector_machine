It is very intersting to see how Steinbeck shows how much these two men resemble people in a family.  I relate this a lot to myself, I see Lennie as my brother who has some difficulties and challenges, and me as George.  Sometimes I get real fed up with him, and extremely annoyed, and I do things like George that then tend to hurt his feelings, make me feel bad and then apologize and make it up to him.  My brother is also big like Lennie, and if anyone else trys to take advandtage of him or make fun of him, it ticks me off.  The same thing is with George, no one else can do anything to Lennie except him.  I like the way Steinbeck uses a lot of sentence manipulation so you can get a real grip of the attitude the characters have espcecially Lennie, it really helps the reader get into the book more.
