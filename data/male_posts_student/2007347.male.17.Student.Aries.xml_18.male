The final orgasm of school was a month ago no one wants pillow talk with Mr Mott. Lets move on.   Uni looks a lot more better, no matter what your doing your free, you are free, cause school is ok if you don't have to come in at 7, don't have to listen to sarge and go to assembly crap. That is uni that is what we want, it is good. Women, the women will clearly be good. Ye. No more rugby, everyone will hopefully grow up, and if they don't they get thrown out,   but not only that, but in a few more weeks we as people will finally have a say, we will soon vote, people older than us will no longer see us as school 'kids' we will be men, Men looking for poon.   freedom! FREEDOM FROM ALL THAT IS SECONDARY WE ENTER A NEW AGE.   NOW WE ARE FREE......
