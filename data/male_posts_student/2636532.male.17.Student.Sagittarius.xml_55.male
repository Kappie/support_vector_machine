So yesterday i went to K-days, which is a carnival that comes to edmonton every year and i was on this ride called Spin Out and i sat on my hat cuz i didn't want to lose it, but we went upside down and it started to slip, so i grabbed it and held on to it, i completely forgot that my wallet was in my back pocket and it was loose, after i got off the ride i realised that it was missing, so i went to the carni running the ride to see if they'd spotted it, of course they hadn't. bout an hour and a half later we came back and asked them again, this time they had it, but of course all the money was gone, i guess it's not that bad seeing as al the cards were all still there, but i know that fucking carni took the money they would've been the only ones that touched it, i was pissed but there was no way i could prove it, but i was absolutly amazed at one thing, when i was on the ride the guy right next to me grabbed my keys in mid-air it was sweet they just had fallen out of my pocket and BAM he grabbed them, i was damn lucky then i woulda been screwed without those keys.  -Matt
