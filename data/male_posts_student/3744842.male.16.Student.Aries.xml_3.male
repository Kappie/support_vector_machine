It was a big mess, whoever did it should be ashamed........or proud one.  While we were there Mrs.Watts fixed us a very nice big breakfast, then we headed out to go to J.w.'s house to ride four-wheelers. It was muddy and a ton of fun.  It was shaun, j.w., and me all there riding, it wasnt that muddy but enough to get a four-wheller really stuck.  Thats about all for now, today has been great, and it just keeps getting better!
