First, I finally got a  urlLink Gmail  account!!  1000MB of email space, so I'll probably never have to delete an email again.  Those of you who know me know that I like to archive everything, so this is totally awesome.  Hotmail is soon going to be giving us 250MB of space, and Yahoo! is also giving us 100MB of space now which is fantastic.  Ok, next.  I went to St. Maarten last weekend!!  It was the best time that I've had since I've been here.  We stayed at this place on the Dutch side called the Maho Beach Resort.  All I can say is that it was incredible.  AUC students must be having the time of their lives there in St. Maarten, as nearly all the luxuries you have at home are available.  Prices are very reasonable, and the people there actually care about efficiency!  Yes, that's the economist in my talking :P  Anyhow, other than that, this past week has been quite busy.  We did the cranial nerves and the brachial plexus in neuro, and spinal column in anatomy.  There was a ton of information, but I didn't seem to get anything wrong on the exams ;)  Woot!  Chemistry, however, was a complete shock!!  Let's put it this way, all the people with the top marks in the class (apparently) did rather poorly, and those students who were failing quite badly got the highest marks in the class!  It makes no sense whatsoever.  A number of us suspect that something very fishy is going on, namely a "nigerian scam" as we say around here.  I'll definately have to remedy this situation on Monday.  Ok, I'm getting tired.  Bye.
