I had to wake up this morning and go work at this guy's house that i know from church..........cut grass etc. Then at about 5 i got home and washed my brother's truck.........then i went to toco bell to get dinner and since then i've done absolutely nothing. But i did find out i'm going to the lake next week........its gonna be a lot of fun!
