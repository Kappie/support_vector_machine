We've gained a lot during this month, and i'm suprised we managed to fit it all into our two suitcases. Still, we managed and the two cases are just about full to bursting point  after lunch, me, yuqi, her parents and sister took two taxis to shijiazhuang station for our 3 hour trip back. We were to stay in beijing tonight before flying out tomorrow afternoon. We said our goodbyes, thanked everyone and set off.  The train journey was uneventful, and we arrived in beijing without a hitch. Yuqi's brother wang zheng was waiting for us, and took us to our room for the night. In his apartment block, there were rooms available for short stays, so we were able to have a very nice room just opposite from his room.   We chatted for a while and set off for dinner. We thought we'd sample a chinese pizza hut to give my belly a change. Jinbo is working in beijing, so we invited him and two of his housemates along. Pizza hut here is very similar to the uk (with similar prices, expensive for china). I did notice they can serve snails as a starter, which i didn't want to try :)  after the meal, we all walked to a pedestrianised shopping street. It's very well known, and i'd actually been before in 2002. We sat and drank beer until bedtime.
