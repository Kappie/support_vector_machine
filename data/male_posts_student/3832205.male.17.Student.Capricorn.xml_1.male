I thought I'd run out of things to say,  two more hours until today burns this away,  and it starts all over again,  the sky will never look the same again,  till you show me how it could be,  the sky will never look the same again,  till you show me how it could be   and everything else is irrelevant,  to the story so far,  a coincidence that you look like her from a far,  is it true that you like to sleep alone?  Or is it what you just tell everyone?   Did you notice that I was afraid?  I thought I'd run out of things to say  two more hours until today burns this away,  and it starts all over again  the sky will never look the same again,  till you show me how it could be  the sky will never look the same again  till you show me how it could be   and when the world turns over  ill keep my ears to the wall  and when the world turns over  ill keep my feet straight on the ground   did u notice I was afraid?  I thought I'd run out of things to say,  two more hours until today burns this away,  and it starts all over again,  the sky will never look the same again  till you show me how it could be  the sky will never look the same again  till you show me how it could be
