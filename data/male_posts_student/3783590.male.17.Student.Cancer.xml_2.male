The  Cravings  anthology will be out in a couple of days ( June 29th to be exact). It contains chapter 11 - 13 of Incubus Dreams, as well as other works from other authors. On a personal note...   I have graduated from school and have decided to take the summer off, so I will be able to update, and create stuff for the website continuously. I'm happy about that. I've been wanting to get to that for a long time now, but never really had anytime. I'm also thinking about moving the circus log to blogspot.com where I have my personal log set up now. Take a look at my personal log and tell me what you think. Yes, I plan to fix the chat box.  Toodles,   Juliana Ayala (MG)
