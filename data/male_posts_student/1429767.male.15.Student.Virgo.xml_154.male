I think im going to the liquid room with melissa and courtney like 5 days after my surgery so im going to be all doped up on some painkillers and i'll probably have black eyes and a bandage on my nose from it lol thats going to be fun though, im excited about it... so far this summer i've cleaned the chairs and thats probably all that i will as far as cleaning goes, im on vacation why should i do any bullshit? i shouldnt right? well anyway... josh has his cam over and i let steve see it for a sec it was pretty cool, too bad i have shit internet bc it was super slow lol but it always is slow so who cares... steve is awesome ppl that know me would like him im sure... lol josh liked his american voice lol it was funny as hell i couldnt stop laughing! wow lol he cracks me up! yesterday was full of dullness, all we did was like sit around and talk the whole time, i drank a 2 liter of mountain dew that was good... this weekend im probably going to be drinking at my bros graduation party, im pretty sure my mom will let me idk if i will or not though b/c i have to get up early sunday to help my dad put in windows, fun fun! eric wants me to go over to his house this summer, i probably will hes pretty cool so yeah i will. i cant really think of anything right now so fuck it...   Ilove u steve!
