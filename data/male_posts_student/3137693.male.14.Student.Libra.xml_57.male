Anyway i thought that was kind of an interesting discovery and everyone should bow down to me and kiss my feet because .. well i dont know.. im just really tired and i cant think of anything else better to talk about.  UPDATE: I Updated the about me page, okay it was really late and i was totally wasted. Leave me alone. Creamed corn.
