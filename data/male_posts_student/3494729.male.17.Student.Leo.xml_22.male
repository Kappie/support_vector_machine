I actually had a cool, productive day today that didn't result in me coming home and listening to depressing Dashboard songs all night, so thanks to all the people I hung out with today. I learned that if you put an egg in a microwave for a minute, take it out, and just hold it, eventually it will explode. This could make me rich if I play my cards right. Anyway I'm going up to Pinetop till Saturday morning.  Katie: dust off the bass, it's game time.  -alex
