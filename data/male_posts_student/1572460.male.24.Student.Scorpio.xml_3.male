Shaun, a fellow Computer Science student at CSU (who recently graduated), and I have been good friends ever since I came to CSU, nearly two years ago. Shaun is a Type-I diabetic himself, and he was the first person I talked to (apart from my family) when I was diagnosed on January 1, 2003. We became more close friends in the last 6 months. He is one of the nicest blokes I have ever met in my life. He graduated in May with a BS in Computer Science, whereas Carrie too graduated on the same day (that's neat!), with a BA in Music. Moreover, Carrie is a Ayurvedic Medicine practitioner as well as a Yoga Instructor. I was really looking forward to their wedding, and I am glad I was able to attend it yesterday. Incidentally, this was the very first wedding of a friend of mine, which I have attended. This is kind of interesting... Ketaki, another close friend at CSU, got married a few months back (the day when I landed in Pune from USA), but I could not attend her actual "wedding" and managed to make it to the reception for only a few minutes; so Ketaki, you do not qualify as the "first" one here. :)   The wedding was at Trinity Methodist Church at 2:15 pm, in Denver, CO, which is a 75-90 minute drive from Fort Collins. We (myself and some of Shaun's friends) arrived at the church around 30 minutes before the start of the ceremony. When we stepped inside the church, I quickly realized that I was the odd one out; I looked partly lost and partly in awe of the church and the surroundings. The scene was straight out of Hollywood and previously experienced only in movies and read about in books. However, I tried my best to look good. In the morning I wasn't sure exactly what would be appropriate to wear for the wedding. One of Shaun's friends told me that dressing up is not a big deal for an American wedding, unless they have explicit dress-code mentioned in the invitations, and he even said that there will be some people who will dress formally, while some would prefer to remain fairly casual. In the end, I guess I made the right decision to wear my suit, when I saw that almost everybody was dressed to perfection. Another reason for me being kind of lost, was that I was perhaps the only "single" guy out there, if one decided to leave the kids out, and assuming that all the pairs of "ladies  gentlemen" were actual 'couples'. Man, there cannot be a better wake up call! :D. This conclusion about being single was based on the fact that when we entered the church (in a queue), everyone was supposed to sign the guest book (elaborate!!), and after signing up and getting a handout of the marriage ceremony from the attendants, we had to go ahead and grab a seat for ourselves; and I observed that everybody who went ahead, except for me, went as a pair, escorting themselves :). The church seemed quite HUGE, atleast for me, and I have no idea how big they normally are. But  considering that this was right in the middle of downtown Denver, and that Shaun/Carrie's family had reserved this place a year ago, I guessed that this church should be really busy all year round. I did not waste time in clicking my camera away to glory for the church pictures, as they do not allow you to take pictures during the ceremony and I had no idea what was in store after it would be over.  The ceremony began with the "Processional", which is a hymn or other selection piece played or sung during the church procession (during the arrival of the bride, groom, and others), at the beginning of the service or ceremony in this case. The Processional was arranged for organ by Daniel Jones and was called as "Sinfonia and Toccata (L'Orfeo) Monteverdi". So far as I understood, Monteverdi is the name of the original Composer, and the rest is the name of the piece. :) It did create a very typical church atmosphere, and the classical music felt pretty good.  Shaun, the Groom, arrived first in the direction facing us (we were seated), which to me seemed not readily noticeable. (We entered through what I will call as the balcony, like in a cinema house). The Groom was the only person who arrived facing us, while all others arrived through the doors behind us. Don't know if this had some sort of significance. Next came the "Ring Bearer", one of Carrie's cousins - a cute little boy carrying the wedding ring (who was understandably confused and overwhelmed but was happy to grab the attention of the 200 people gathered). He was followed by two little 'Flower Girls', also Carrie's cousins, who spread rose petals on the white carpet for the Bride to walk on later. Then came the six Bridesmaids (cousins and friends of Carrie) and the six Groomsmen (friends of Shaun, brother of Carrie), in pairs. Again, I am not sure if the number six has a significance, or whether it depends on every wedding. (I have a lot of questions for Shaun, when I meet him next). Next to follow was the pair of Maid of Honor (college friend of Carrie) and Best Man (college friend of Shaun). All Bridesmaids and Groomsmen were dressed in the same fashion. Finally, Carrie, the Bride, wearing an amazing white wedding gown, was ushered in onto the white silk carpet laid down earlier. Well, I don't think I can describe the wedding gown here :p :), but it was stunning, and it only has to be seen in person if you have to realize its beauty. Carrie was the Cinderella of the hour.  The hour long ceremony that followed can briefly be described (in order) as follows:  - Call to Worship, by the wedding officiant - Meaning of Marriage, by the wedding officiant - Reading of Sonnet 116, Shakespeare, by Carrie's uncle - Statements of Intent - Blessings of the Couple - Reading of 1 Corinthians 13:4-13 (??), by Carrie's friend  :) - Vows (a short speech prepared by Shaun and Carrie themselves) - Exchange of Rings - Lighting of Unity Candle - "Sing to Me" a beautiful, original song, with guitar accompaniment, composed and performed by Carrie's friend for their wedding. - Prayer of Blessings - Lord's Prayer - Pronouncement of Marriage - Introduction - Recessional  (a hymn or musical piece that accompanies the exit of the clergy  and choir after a service or ceremony).  Most of the ceremony's proceedings were easy to follow and were explained in simple English :), although for me, its hard to describe them in writing, but hopefully you will get a fair idea from what I have posted.  And then, after the ceremony got over, it was time for the photo shoot. I again helped myself to a few pictures of the bride and groom.   Immediately following the wedding ceremony was the reception at The Pinnacle Club just across the street from the church. The reception was held on the topmost (38th) floor of this really tall building, I guess owned by Qwest, the phone company. The view from the top was spectacular. Denver's downtown might not be comparable to some of the other US cities on the East/West coast, but the building did provide a fantastic view of the other sky scrapers, and the Rocky Mountains in the background. Truly, the Rockies are the jewels of Colorado and the USA! Prior to the dinner, we hanged about around the bar and the guest room where everybody sipped on their drinks and had snacks, and mingled with other guests/friends.  The dinner thing was somewhat new to me. We had to pick individual cards that had our names written on it, plus the table number, and then that was to be our dinner table (elaborate, once again!!). From what I observed, there were 8 people assigned to one table. Again, the entire setup was Hollywood style, everything was set in perfection, very plush. At one point of time, it looked like I was at the Oscars..whee! :)) Dinner was shrimp cocktail, spinach salad, veggie lasagna, chicken in garlic mustard sauce, desserts,...and I-dont-recall-what-else. :) After the dinner, came the fun part. The couple cut their huge wedding cake, and everybody made a toast to them and their family members. A band played live music, and Shaun  Carrie danced to some romantic as well as foot-tapping numbers, amidst loud cheer from everybody. They did a great job! Other dances which followed were made up of pairs: father-daughter, son-mother, son--mother-in-law, daughter--father-in-law (and I guess every other combination). :) One of Shaun's friends mentioned to me that this was a really unique wedding, in terms of the magnitude of family members from both sides of the bride and groom, and that was great to see. It turned out to be a one big united family eventually. In the meanwhile, all the guests were in a party mood, and for the next 45 minutes, everybody was on the dance floor, yes, including me. :) However, after shaking a leg or two, I was back at my table, pondering over the fact that if anybody ever makes me dance during my reception, I would have to pull up my socks for sure (another wake up call for yours truly!!) :D. In between, there were short speeches from the Maid of Honor, the Best Man, and the fathers of Shaun and Carrie, a proud moment for them. I guess the party must have continued well into the night...I took some more pictures and it was almost time to go...  Shaun and Carrie make a great couple. Congratulations and Best Wishes to them!  Inside Story :p: They flew to Tanzania, Africa, for their honeymoon today. They will summit Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa, which is close to 20,000 feet. I can't wait to hear from Shaun about their summit experience! Now that's the way to do it!
