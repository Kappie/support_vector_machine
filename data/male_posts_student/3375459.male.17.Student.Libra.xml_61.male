Tutorial from 8am to 3pm, how sick is that? I practically stared at the monitor the hold day, until bothers five started playing games on ebaumsworld.com. There was  urlLink Penguin Bat ,  urlLink Home Run  and lots more. We got so bored that we spin ourselves on our chair and tried to walk straight, kind of like the game Home Run. Funny sia, Cher Hao went sideway walking and landed himself on the floor. We were really enjoying that before school was over. On the way towards Dover Station, Cher Hao keeps on asking us to slower our pace. If I’m not wrong, we spin him too much and he’s all ready to throw up. Hahaha… its play time for Shawn and me. We acted liked we were going to puke to disgust Cher Hao, but too bad I had to alight at my stop and not see him puke.    When I got home, animes were waiting for me. Yupz, Lao Er downloaded them while I was in school. So I decided keep my homework for later and anime marathon it was. I went back to ebaumsworld.com later again, and shattered my previous record for Home Run with 86 meter. Hehehhehe v ^_^ v. Very soon it was dinner time and also show time. AND THEN!!!!! Poof~ the lights went out with every other electrical appliance (just a section of the hold block). My parents disappeared into the dark, it’s now my Baby T and me. Wonder why I did it, but I manage to send out one “ Blackout! ” sms before the lights came back. Sigh~ just when I was so happy about not doing my work, the lights just had to come back. Blackout that lasted less then a minute, that must be the doings of the renovation workers. Lao Er was using this pc afterwards, so I had to use her laptop to do my draft write up. Laying down and doing silly write up, my eyelids suddenly feels like a thousand kilograms. Have to wake up at 6 to kick Lao Er off her bed and 7 to do my write up.      Knock Out!
