They make me feel good for some reason. The trip will be interesting.. I am rooming with Josh Priniski, Justin Dzeja, and probably CJ, but I think he really wants to room with Brian and Christian. Ah, well, it'll probably be CJ anyways. Well, we developed a tradition last year where we would bring a RISK game with us to the hotel and play RISK every night.  It seems that the tradition spilled over into a regular weekend event held at my house once a month or so.                   Good times.. good times.
