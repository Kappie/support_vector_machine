Consequently, my dog was left in her crate for about 10 hours.  Needless to say, because I'm a big baby, I worried about her.  Well, when I came home, she was fine, and she was ridiculously happy to see me.  That's why I love dogs.  She wasn't pissed off at me for leaving her alone all day, she wasn't mad for being locked up.  No, she was just happy that I was home.  They are always just happy for the time they get to spend with you and for the love that you give them.  While growing up, I had a few dogs.  I was going to write about Chance, who died a year ago.   And about Charlotte, who left us last week.  I find the idea of writing about them makes me sad.  I don't want to be sad, and I know for sure they wouldn't want me to be.  So, for now, I won't write of them.  Instead I will pet the puppy in my lap and tell her I love her.  She makes me so happy.
