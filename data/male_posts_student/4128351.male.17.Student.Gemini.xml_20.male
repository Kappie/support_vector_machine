I've accomplished nothing; if anything, I've made things worse for everyone.  I'm glad I have that power.     You know, my main concern is to just be kind to people, and in my quest for that I somehow get everyone mad at me.  I try so hard, too.  I'm constantly running around, like I'm on fire, just doing stuff for people.  I can't win.  I've accepted that, through my seventeen years of life, I can't and will never win.  I can't please people.  I quit.      That was pretty depressing, I'm sorry.  I just feel like crying right now.      I woke up and drank a glass of orange juice and a glass of milk.  I took the pill that doesn't help me.  I drove to the plantation and fed Max, Tiger, and Whitey.  Then, I mowed grass for too long.      Then, I actually ate something for once.  I got a shower, and drove to my girlfriend's house.  I stayed there for longer than forty-five minutes, then I went to the fair: probably the biggest mistake I made today.  Not for the fact that it's the fair, but for the look in my girlfriend's eyes when I left.  I hate it.      I saw alot of people tonight that I care about.  I saw alot of people tonight that care about me.  I can't throw those people away, I feel like I've neglected them.  It's my fault, no one elses.      Milen walking around the fair with his Dad almost brought me to tears.  To see his face light up when we made eye contact killed me.  I feel ashamed.  He tells me that I'm his best friend ever, and he's serious.  Knowing how I treat him, and knowing how he feels about me, I just want to die.     It's like that with everyone though.  I'm always telling Kyle I'll call him, but I never do.  It's just easier for me, but it probably gives him more of a chance to go get in trouble.  If I'd hang out with him more, then maybe he'd stop doing some of the things he does.      This is where I'm at my crossroads.  Why is it MY responsibility to care for these people, to take them under my wing and show them love through actions, not words.  I don't know.  That's two people, but there's so many more.      I don't want to be held accountable for things when I die, but I don't think it's fair for me to stop the life that I've waited so long to live to help everyone.      Beth is another example.  When she probably needed me the most, I started ignoring her.  I know that hurt her more than anything.  Why did I do it?  Because she got on my nerves and made everything worse.      Funny how everything turns out.      I saw alot of people tonight that have hurt me in the past.  To look into their eyes and smile, and show them that I'm happy being myself and not the superficial teenagers that the world tells them to be makes me happier than anything.  I love people, I hate people.  Aren't I confusing?      I think now I'm just ranting.  But, I don't have anyone to talk to about this, I'm on my own again, just like always.  Nobody would understand, even if I tried to explain it to them.  I don't even think I understand.     I took Jamin home and told him I'd hang out with him before he leaves.  I probably won't see him until Sunday.  I'm sorry bro, I love you more than anything.  You're the one friend I respect the most and probably trust the most.  You're loyal.  You're the best.      Right now, Brice is playing some stupid game on Playstation 2.  Mama Dottie and Brogan are asleep, probably in matching nightgowns.  Mom and Dad are in Indiana, having fun without their family.  Dustin is with his girlfriend.  Troy is probably home watching TV.  Jami is with Tracy and Joel somewhere.      And I'm here.  I'm right here.  I'm always here.    Keep cool children, and don't let the cruel world defeat you.  Find joy in something or someone you care about, hold on with all that you have.  Never let go.  When things get rough, don't dwell on them.  Love.  Don't be afraid to cry, emotions are honest.  And if nothing at all, love.  Love with all you have.      Alright, so I'm not Confuscius, but I'm pretty close.  Remember that.  I'll wake up tomorrow morning and I'll be better, everyone has rough days.  I'll be fine.      I'm sorry for everything I've ever done to hurt anyone.  Please, forgive me.  Thanks.        I love you.
