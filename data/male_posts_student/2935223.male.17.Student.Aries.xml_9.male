They seriously piss me off to an extreme I never thought possible.  So, I'm sitting in the broadcast booth with all of them, and they're editing their racist video, and they interviewed both Kyle and Ervin, and they are just sittin' there rippin' on 'em like there's no tomorrow....seriously....I hope they all die horrible painful slow deaths. Japanese was pretty fun, we just reviewed the whole time. Then after lunch I got asked to prom, and I said sure, and I guess I'm going to prom now, YAY!  I haven't decided if this is a good thing or bad thing yet....I'm gonna go with yes....ya...that's right. Hm....what else.....IN TWO DAYS I GO TO JAPAN!!! That's right ladies and germs, in less than 48 hours, I'm going to be on a plane to Japan, and if you don't miss me I will be sad.....sad like a lost puppy, you don't wanna see the sad puppy do you?!?!?!?!?!  That's what I though.....uh........Peace!  Spense
