Let's see, today is the 25th day of the 8th month of the 2003rd year of the "death" of Christ. Let's see, F-Zero GX comes out today, for all of you Gamecube fans. It looks awesome, take a look  urlLink here  (it's a big movie, so I would recommend making sure your computer can take it).  Well, today someone with the name of Anonymous made me give out a new award. The "Colin has laughed" award. I will give this to someone who either got on my nerves or, (as the title suggests) made me laugh. This guy posted a comment on this blogger. If you want to see it it is in the post below this. Please, I highly recommend it. He implies that I have a boring life. Now, I really didn't need a perfect stranger to tell me this. In fact, I believe I put this on the page. Hence the title "You must be bored if you are reading this.". I have a question for my Anonymous friend if he/she happens to be reading: Why are you reading this? I thought my life was uninteresting.  Another thing: why do people abbrievate the word "you". It's not like it takes a while to type. It's a three letter word, one syllable word. I think there should be no such thing as an abbrievation to a one syllable word. Four or five syllables is a bit more understandable.  I highly recommend some of the sites to the side, they are rather interesting.  I thought this was interesting. I think I will try to do it every week. There will always be a link to the left side.    Bay:: Area  Boarding school:: Boarding party (pirates)  Riddle:: Usually easy  Hunger:: Thirster  Allergy:: My foot (it's swollen by some bite and I think I'm having an allergic reaction)  Sponsored:: Skater  Spin:: Top  Interest:: -ing  Scrabble:: 300-95 (one of my scores while I was playing Dominique)  Mold:: -y    Okay, I got my 2 cents out. By the way, if someone asks "A penny for your thoughts" and they put "their two cents worth in" where does the other penny go? Someone's making money. Goodnight everyone. Speaking of money, I got a new get rich quick scheme. All I need is a few shaved lobsters, a willing patient, and a waiver releasing me from any physical harm done to this patient. I got some lobsters to shave.
