That movie made me feel a combination of angry and sad over a lot of things in our society.  I just don't get how people can accept how things are being run. I recently read a comment on a website about how Reagan's cutting of welfare was good because it forces people to get jobs. Then this person (who has a masters in economics), said that despite the free trade policy that outsourced jobs... there was a great deal of insourcing as well. I simply don't get how these people can say tout the benefits of these economic policies, when cities are crumbling. Michael Moore discusses this in Roger and Me, and sort of makes a parallel in how this results in more poor people enlisting in Farenheit 9/11.  **
