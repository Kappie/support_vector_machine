Anyway, got a mufti day this friday, that should be fun, and there was this puzzle day today at school, where they got "gifted" people to do puzzles, none of us were convinced on the choosing of the gifted, i.e. A dumbass like James Bolten goes.. but the genius Hwang doesn't.. and there was alot of other cases like this.. almost no-one was in French. . . .  I've been getting this weird rash/burn thing on my arms recently, where my arms go red, and feel like they're on fire..  I'm a celebrity get me out of here is on! must dash!!! (I know.. how sad =P)
