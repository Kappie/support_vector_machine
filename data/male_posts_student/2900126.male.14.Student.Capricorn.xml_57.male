Sonya's back, Chichi is coming back in like three weeks, and my beloved LinZ is going to New York in like a week in a half. Sonya brought mw back a lighter from Canadia *yay* it's like a car and the only thing I don't like aboiut it is the marajuana sign on it althought I haven't seen it yet.    I just found out today that Nia * a friend* doesn't like rap music.   Why does it seem like all the ghetto kids are dumb and all the kids that aren't ghetto and listen to like alternative and punk music and stuff like that are smart?  I really think that this is the generation of smart and artsy kids.     I have a true issuse- I don't know who I am. I know it sounds stupid but it's important to me because I don't know alot about myself and the only person that can help me "find myself" is myself. I tried listing all the things that I liked and disliked but that didn't work to well. I just hope that I turn out to be a great guy that makes a differnce in peoples lives in the future.
