Naturally,the blistering heat was to blame as ourz was the firz game.  the 2nd game was better as we slowly shifted into high gear as we controlled the match from start to finish~ if i was not wrong,we won 3-1~ the third match however was a disaster~ it seemed lyk the spsu comp agst Line 7. We were thrashed wif absolutely no answerz for our dismal display. It was we were fighting a foregone conclusion when in reality all we needed was a draw to get through the group stages winning marginnally by goal difference. haiz~ Tez are next. blardy hell of paperz~ got thru the rez wif relative ease but did badly for MIP~ argh!!!! when m i gonna settle in well wif physics? calculationz are not much of a prob but tonz of mumbo-jumbo thrash shit about materials which seems rather unrelevant dun make much sense to me~ Reports even more worse~ cant remember much of wad i do coz seemed to do them without using much brain power~ lolz~ the only one would be MIP which i wrote wif farok about floorball blades~ abt itz use,itz material and FLOORBALL! lolz~ guez i'm juz a floorball freak~  Manz,gonna miz airhooking for two weekz~ gonna "puasa" airhook to concentrate on studiez a little~ LUCK plz~ May the examz be in the palm of my hand~ lolz~ dun wad i saying oso~  The rising sun bringz freshness to the day, The glowing moon sees all but me, You brought me hope, my inspiration all day, No more alone but she and me...
