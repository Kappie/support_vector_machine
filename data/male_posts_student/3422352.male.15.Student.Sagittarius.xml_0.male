I beleive that it talks about how evil and corrupt the world still is and how inhumane we are. 'Behind the Sun' was also a book written by Hillel Slovak, the first guitarist of Red Hot Chili Peppers. He was also Anthony(singer)'s best friend.  Hillel tragically died from a heroine overdose in 1988, the year I was later born. 'Under the Bridge' was written to commemorate his death.  I am very interested in Hillel. In all of the band's pictures he looks so distant. He was a magician on guitar and a very talented musician elsewhere. He encouraged Flea to start playing the Bass Guitar, and actually taught him some of it. He could also play Sitar, which I hear takes a lot of skill to play.  John Fruscante (current guitarist) used to go and watch the Chili Peppers. They were his favorite band. He joined the band when he was 19 and braught them fame and glory.  So, that's how this part of the site got it's name...
