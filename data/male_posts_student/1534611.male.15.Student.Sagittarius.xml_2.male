The sweet light no longer strikes against your eyes. Your shade has been banished to... the Fifth Level of Hell!  Fifth Level of Hell  --------------------------------------------  The river Styx runs through this level of Hell, and in it are punished the wrathful and the gloomy. The former are forever lashing out at each other in anger, furious and naked, tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth. The latter are gurgling in the black mud, slothful and sullen, withdrawn from the world. Their lamentations bubble to the surface as they try to repeat a doleful hymn, though with unbroken words they cannot say it. Because you lived a cruel, vindictive and hateful life, you meet your fate in the Styx.   Here is how you matched up against all the levels: (Click on a level for more info)  Level Who are sent there?
