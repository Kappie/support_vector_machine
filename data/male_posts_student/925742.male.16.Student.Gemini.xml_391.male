Ok, heres the deal, I want to do something for new years.  Possible people involved may include:  Kim - We could do something romantic, the two of us.... but if you're busy, let me know, ok?  I just want to see you a bit more this vacation.   Alex - If that falls through, maybe some fireworks, some friends, some Bavarian Boyos?  Just a thought, heh heh heh.  Ok, I'm out.
