Life just moves so fast  and I think I'm out of time.  The days are getting shorter  but longer in my mind.  I'll pin the blame on anyone  or anything but myself.  Mabye someday I'll realize  that I could use some help.  I could strategize the plot again  but I know it will fall apart.  More and more it seems so clear  that I should have never played a part.   Running away from my problems  is not what I should do.  And to throw myself back in...  the abuse would be too cruel.   My ambition is too much again.  So many thoughts are in my mind.  I'll take a chance on what seems so plain  but patterns of complications is only what I'll find.  I'll pin the blame on everything  when the causes are only mine.  For awhile I wont stage the plot  I'll be in the shadows on my own  and again I'll curse myself because I knew I should have known.
