Also i got a pink t-shirt (which im wearing now) from Cult. That day was soo cool we should do it agian.  Later on i went to one of siobhans 'social gatherings'  and i had a bit too much to drink. Stuff happened there that was quite cool but also i got a bit messed up in the head and i would like to apologise to all i upset and offended while i was there.  Anyhoos i better be going nows  Tom
