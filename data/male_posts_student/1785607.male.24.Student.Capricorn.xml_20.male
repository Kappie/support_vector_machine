I have a crush... it was first by net, then phone... now I've seen the guy and he's dreamy...!  At first he was kinda of annoying, he expected me to respond his questions or comments over the net right away. With time I grow to tolerate it, and also to get to know a really cool guy.  Suddendly he became eager... he wanted my number, my phone number. I refused at first ... then I remembered what I have wrote on this blog days before about being to self conscious and a little too chicken to make contact, personal contact, so I gave in... but before, we made an appointment to meet and get to know each other. He had already seen my pics and had a good share of msn with cam (by my side) but I just haven't by that time seen any of him.  So I got there, spent a few hours, oh I'm kidding, just an hour and he never showed up. I got the sense that maybe he saw me ( at least he knew who I was ) and then left with out saying a word. Later that day (like and hour later) he got online and asked for my number... and as I said, I gave in and let him call me...  And so he did. He had a voice !!!!!  Oh what a voice...!!! We spoke on the phone for a good hour, maybe more. He still wanted for me to meet him somewhere, I wasn't going to, after he blowing me off earlier... aside, he said he was going to Yuma or something like it.... He explained why he didn't show up ... and it was ok by me... he made a good point ( meaning that I have been victim of it several times ...  ).  He called the next day (9/15/03) and asked me for a date... again...!!! This time at night, he said he would call first, 'cause I said: "maybe I would, maybe I won't" He did call, but this time with an offer: "Can I meet with you tomorrow afternoon?" I said yes, gave him my address ( wow... have I changed or what? snap snap ). He told me he would pass by my house that night to just know for sure where I lived (uh huh!) ... Later, not even an hour I think, I heard a "ding dong"... I kinda looked through the window and saw him, and thought "maybe is him"  ... then I thought "sure thing is my brother's friend".... So I opened the door and he asked for my brother... I was so disappointed and said "NO" and almost close the door... what a shame and a waste, he was cute... He started laughing and told me his name.... HE, was HIM.  Man, it all fit: voice, looks, attitude, fashion sense ;) ... and I was there, with my geeks look with a dorky look... and I thought ".. mmm...  this guy looks loaded"  hahahaha j/k!!!  Still, I'm meeting him tomorrow, just hope this time I'm not the one pushing aside.. 'cause so far I dig what I saw...!!! I'll keep u posted...
