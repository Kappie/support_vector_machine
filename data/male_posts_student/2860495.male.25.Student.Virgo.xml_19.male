Most of you fancy yourselves to be so progressive and liberal, yet Dean was, after Lieberman, the most conservative of the potential nominees.  We've ended up with a healthy moderate to liberal ticket which includes a rising star with great appeal in John Edwards.  It just wears me out to hear these Dean people whine.
