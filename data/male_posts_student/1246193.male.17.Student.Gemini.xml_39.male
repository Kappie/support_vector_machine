It began a few weeks ago when he told me my hair was too long and that I needed to get it cut.  After some negotiating we came to an agreement that I would cut my hair.  Today I went in to have my hair cut.  Lorenne cut my hair very well and to my exact specifications.  Toward the end of the hair cut who do you suppose came striding through the door? My dad. He looked at my hair, told me it was still too long, and told me he wouldn't pay unless she cut more off.  He knew full well I had no money.  She cut it off.  He butchered it.  He is pretending like nothing happened and I am restraining myself from screaming vulgarness at him.  My self control is very low right now, which doesn't happen very often, and if he says anything more to me I really think I could kill him.
