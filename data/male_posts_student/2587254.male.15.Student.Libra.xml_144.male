Right now where I stand it's impossible for me to fail any class =P. So I'm not really worrying....and stress levels are at an all time low *whoo!* So yeah right now life's good with theory done, slowin' down on piano since exam ain't for another 7 months or so, and school's almost over. HOME STRETCH!!!!!!  Woke up at 730 this morning for school. I'm feelin' a lot better now compared to other days as I'm not as sick, and I felt a lot better with my new prescription glasses today and didn't feel like I was going to puke. So headed downstairs after doin' morning routine, ate, packed my bags and then left for school...  Finally getting to school around 810 or so, I quickly tread to music class since the bell was going to ring in 5. So got ready for music and stuff, Arjun has figured out the accompinament for my trombone solo which is good news. Hehe I didn't really start practicing Niki's or Kelsey's until today.....gotta make it good so they don't kill me if I suck lol. So today in music class some woman came in to sub for Wharton since they didn't get back from NYC until 2am, but unfortunately this teacher doesn't know jack about music. So me and Amy in the end begun conducting the class, which wasn't exactly the greatest thing in the world but hey we managed to get some work done lol. And then for rep I played Bradburn's sax parts.....so yeah wasn't a productive class...who cares though we need one of those every once in a while =P.  Science....we have a lab due for Wednesday that's about looking at our front lawn, and then we also watched some lame video. VERY boring stuff. Science never really gets better....just worse (ie we don't get to go to Zoo like the other classes =@).  Lunch: Mike, John and I headed down to Galleria where I got that breakfast thing from International Soups like usual if I go to Galleria. Ate that, talked for a bit, NYC apparently whooped ass according to John. Ugh now I REALLY regret I didn't join senior band earlier lol. Oh well...least I get to go next year.....and the year after if I decide to take music in gr. 12 also =P. So after lunch.....ugh the wonderful world of Biology...where we are learning taxonomy and finishing up the respiratory system.  Bio class started REALLY slow for me as I was sleeping for first half. Then we did our respiratory lab....where I found out my lung capacity really sucks lol, and then started taxonomy. My way of remembering the different classification names:  King Phillip Can Order Farm Grown Straberries Kingdom Phylum Class Order Family Genus Species  Brilliant eh?! Lol....apparently much of the class likes my little creation there haha. Took up a sheet of fill in the blanks, and stuff....didn't really do much but the lab was fun. Got to run around the hallways to see how much breathing I need after running.  English: We did these stupid FGT Questions.  And then Stage Band X Practice. Last practice of the year for us before our big Spring Concert. It was a good run through of the songs, and pretty funny when Dave Rutt was conducting w/ his trombone haha. Hmm...what else happened I don't know...we ran through music, and stuff....and Mrs. Wharton approved my solo piece for year end assignment. Not much else I don't think....*shrug*  And heading home. Hmm since I had to wait for bus, I read a bit of Purpose Driven Life while waiting. Also, while waiting at my bus stop today though....I thought I saw a person from LCAC. Problem is though...  I don't know who it is. I know she goes to my church.....but I've never talked to her, or even tried to meet her. I guess it's kinda weird how I barely even know the person, but not until like a week ago did I even know she's in gr. 12. She's in the Chinese congregation, and this just shows how seperated the English ministry can be from Chinese. I really hope that changes though, as it did feel kinda weird....like the feeling of "OH I KNOW THEM.....wait do I?" Hmm....never really thought of it as a prayer request sorta thing....but I would really like to see more church unity between the two congregations. Felt so weird seeing a fellow church member walk by, yet I can't even say hi since I don't even know who she is.  Well anyways.....bused home....just got home before rain started pouring. HOLY CRAP it was a friggin' monsoon here for most of the afternoon. Hail, rain, Lightning, etc. Rain got so heavy at a time while playing SC that I couldn't even see out of my window. Pissed me off too since my compy shut down twice because of power surges *ugh.* That then made me restart my compy, and also downed my uptime for my comp. Oh well....anyways after stable power was back, I played a bit of RollerCoaster Tycoon for some reason, and then some SC where I whooped some ass along w/ Jason and some other random people on Bnet.  So did that for abit, then drummed, dinner, showered, and some other stuff in no particular order. Hmm.....Flyers won tonight I think....well 5-0 by 2nd period says something...and I'm now gonna head to sleep. Whee late start day tomorrow. Too bad I have band....but at least it's still an hour later =P.  Cya.
