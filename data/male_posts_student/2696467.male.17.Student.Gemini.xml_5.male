I'm having that righ now, LOL, I know I have this song on one of my cds ( I Have like 40+ mix cds, and like 10 mp3 cds that have 100+ songs) and I really want to hear it but cant think of which cd has it, nor the name, title or anything...its just there in my head. LOL, anyway I just got back from driving my mom to the grocery store which was pretty interesting considering I can't park at all....man I almost hit a truck, was like 3 inches from it...LOL...  Anyway I got up this morning and looked at the newspaper and saw we are supposed to get up to 8 inches of snow tonight and even more tomorrow night into Tuesday!! Man I'm gettin tired of this, but if I get off school Tuesday it'd be cool (I already have off Monday).  My dad just got a George Forman Mean Lean Grilling Machine or whatever, and that thing makes the absolute WORST hamburgers in the world...they are so flat and dry, and when I make the same hamburger in the microwave it taste sooo much better (Yes you can make hamburgers in the microwave...LOL I just found that out like 2 weeks ago.)  Well I'm gonna go, Later, -HAZE-
