Every man had worked to be here, probably harder than he'd ever worked in his life. those with troubled pasts had taken harsh measure of themselves. Beneath their best hard-ass act, most were achingly earnest, patriotic, and idealistic. They had literally taken the army up on its offer to "Be All You can Be"  We know you got the brains, because you had to have a 110 GT to get here, We know you got the brawn, because you all just passed the PT test. The formula for making it through the Q-Course is really simple. It's 10% Brains, 10% Brawn, and 90% Heart, add that up and you get 110%, that's what you need to give everyday, day in and day out, and I guarantee, you'll make it through this course, now we're going to find out, just how much heart you've got.  Don't be light. Don't be late.  Somebody has to get in and kill the enemy. Somebody has to be in the infantry and the paratroops. If the country all had your attitude, nobody would fight, everybody would be in the Quartermaster. And what kind of a country would that be?
