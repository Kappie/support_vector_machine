I'm sure a lot of you really care- a lot.  in other news, I have to revise the state dept proposal on Cyprus. Not too happy about this, but I think that we can get it, and I think I can still go to Cyprus.  Let's see...what else...I have some sweet ideas for a possible Lessek/ Jozwiak joint bachelor party. If only I was the one planning. Unfortunately, I am not.   I'm going out again with Christina, the girl who went to the Christian fundamentalist college. Turns out she's not so crazy. Actually a really nice girl. So I'm looking forward to going out with her again on Sunday.  PB says...OUTS.
