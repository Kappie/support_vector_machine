I have found out that now I get Atom  urlLink feed  for free it may not be RSS but it's a start, let's just hope that the ugly banner will go away, and some statistics along with pictures would come in nicely. I've had a nice surprise having tried a pre-alpha of the game Painkiller and I must say it's scary :), nice graphics, monsters and a lot of blood. It's a bit slow on my Radeon 9600 but I knew what I was buying. Meanwhile we at  urlLink sigmalab  are opening a  urlLink forum , it's in Italian and mostly covering some programming issues and our software projects. If interest is shown we will open discussions in English as well.
