Basically it's about private law -- people making their own agreements, what it takes to make one of these agreements have legal force, and what happens when the agreements get broken.  Contracts is cool because intuitively we all know what a contract is, and make contracts all the time.  Effectively, it's a course about deals gone bad.  You read cases, and you also wade through the Uniform Commercial Code, a collection of the "best practices" of contract law.  This was my favorite 1L class.
