(No sign of Dot) Camera pans back  you can see the camera man that is filming the newscaster.)  Newscaster: Welcome back to good morning Phoenix. We’re here in the home of Mr.  Mrs. Ronald Goddard which is also, coincidentally the classroom for their daughter 7 yr old child-prodigy Karen Goddard.  Karen: Ah Tah Ho Wa which means greetings in Miari which is the native tongue of the people indigenous to New Zealand. It’s also one of 7 languages in which I’m fluent. I am currently a college sophomore equivalent  I’ve recently been accepted to the graduate programs at MIT, Princeton,  Dartmouth. And all of that thanks to the educated commitment of my parents.  Dad: Thank you very much sweetheart.  Mom: Thank you, sweetie.  Newscaster: Alright, so first things first. Why home schooling?  (In the background Dot comes to the door  tries to open it, the door is locked  she continues to pound  knock but the parents ignore her.)  Dad: Well, we just felt that we were better equipped to handle the educational needs  the enormous capacity for learning of our daughter Karen.  Dot: The door’s locked.  Newscaster: Looks like you got somebody at your door there.  Karen: Oh, that’s Dot. Hi! (Karen waves)  Dot: Hi, the door’s locked.  Dad: Oh that’s one of the Neighbor kids.  Dad: Anyways, as I was saying we remain committed to our daughter’s education. It’s the utmost importance to us  we take it very, very seriously.  (Dot crawls in through the doggy door  sits on the chair opposite the newscaster.)  Newscaster: Well, hello there.  Dot: My swing-set tipped over, I think maybe I was swinging too high.   Karen: That’s my twin sister dot. Are you okay?  Dot: I was trapped underneath my swing-set.  Newscaster: I, I thought you said that Karen here was an only child.  Mom: Um, Dot honey uh, why don’t you go play in your room?  Dot: I can’t mom, cuz my body is still underneath the swing-set.  (Dot gets up  starts flapping her arms like they are wings  skips around behind them  gets in their faces.)  Dot: I’m just dot’s spirit. And I’m floating,  I’m floating around.  (Mr. Goddard leans into Dot real close.)  Dad: Then go towards the light Dot.  (Mr. Goddard motions towards the newscaster to continue his questioning.)  Dad: Go ahead.  Newscaster: Should we wait?  Dad: Not at all, don’t worry.   Karen: Dot truly has an enviable imagination.  Mom  Dad (together): No you, have the enviable imagination, you do.  Karen: Yeah, you’re right I do.  Newscaster: So, do you home-school the two girls together or separately?  Karen: Oh, no dot’s not home schooled. Mom  Dad send her to public school.  Mom: She likes it.  Dad: Dot attends Hoorjay Washington elementary.  (Dot springs up into view from behind the couch in between her parents.)  Dot: I used to go to school there, I did but now that I’m a spirit I’m not allowed so, me  God  Jesus are gonna go to the movies instead.  (Mr. Goddard stands up  grabs hold of Dot  pushes her down into the chair. He trades places w/mom while doing this putting him closest to Dot now.)  Dad: All three of you are gonna get punished if you don’t sit down.  Dot: Even God  Jesus?  Dad: Especially God  Jesus.  Newscaster: Ah, so what made you decide to educate your two girls differently?  Dad: Well, Our daughters are clearly very different  therefore have different educational needs.  Mom: And Dot likes cafeterias.  Dot: Everybody there has to wear gloves it’s the law. I wish the whole world was like that.  (Mr. Goddard Glares at Dot for a really long time  there is silence, Dot looks really uncomfortable  squirms in her seat.)   Newscaster: I see well, Mr. Goddard, Mr. Goddard?   Dad: I’m sorry. Go ahead.  Newscaster: Ah how do you respond to critics who argue that home schooling can impair a child’s social skills?   Dad: I think that’s nonsense. We make sure that Karen interacts w/other home schooled girls  that enables us to keep track of who her friends are.  (Dot springs into view again leaning over Mr. Goddard’s shoulder  bounces all around.)  Dot: My friend Hector Agular gave me head lice. He did. I had a million bugs livin’ in my head. They were all over my hair weren’t they? Do you remember?   Mom: Stop.   Dot: My mother, she had to put medicine on my head so that she could kill them all  she thought she did  then my Dad got it. I gave him head lice, He had to shave his head  his back cause he had them all runnin around. It was the funniest thing you ever saw.   Dad: Sit, Sit Down  (Dot has been jumping all around this whole time  is now in front of the couch. Mr. Goddard shakes Dot  pulls her onto the floor in front of her  smacks her on the head.)  Dot: Ow you hit me on the head. Mrs. Nesbit says you shouldn’t hit; that if you’re angry you should use words.   (Mr. Goddard leans into Dot really close.)  Dad: Okay fine. Shut up!  Newscaster: Could we get a look at what a typical day of home-schooling is like?   Dad: Oh sure!  (The newscaster stands  the whole family moves over to the kitchen area behind the couch.)  Newscaster: How bout it? Okay great! Just Pretend I’m not here.  Dot: So Pretend that I’m a unicorn.   (Dot put’s her hands on top of her head to make a horn like a unicorn. She stands behind the center island. The rest of them are in front. She leans over a tray of milk  other food.)  Mom: We like to start each school day with a balanced nutritious meal to ensure Kerens’ productivity.  Dot: What is that?   (Mrs. Goddard picks up the tray of food, pulling it away from Dot’s reach.)  Mom: And then we discuss the days’ lesson plan.  Dot: That looks like food.  Dad: What inspires you today Karen?  (In the Background, Dot gets up on the counter  is rummaging around through the cupboards, clumsily.)  Karen: Well, I thought we could start off where we left off last week  we could talk about the concealed paradox of mathematics  physics. I think that both fields are very interesting…   Dot: I’m gonna have pop tarts, I got pop tarts.   (Dot falls off the counter really hard  lands on the floor behind the island.)  Newscaster: Oh, my God!  Karen: Dot, are you okay?   Dad: She’s fine, she’s fine. Go ahead.  Karen: Dad she fell.  (Karen runs around back to where Dot is laying.)  Karen: Dot, are you okay?  Dot: Karen, look at my arm.   (Dot stands up  has a prop arm wrapped around behind her head  she’s holding the wrist w/her other hand.)  Karen: Oh, my God! I think you separated the clavicle.  Dot: Look, I got a new scarf! My Hand.  (Dot throws the arm around her neck in the manner you would a scarf.)  Karen: Don’t touch it Dot.  (Mr. Goddard walks over to Dot.)  Dot: No, no, no Dad can I keep it please? I wanna show my friends.   Dad: No, No, I’m taking her to the free clinic.   Karen: But Dad you’re a doctor!?   Dad: She likes the free clinic!  (Mr. Goddard picks Dot up  as he is walking out the door w/her over his shoulder, she grabs her wrist, still wrapped around her neck  waves w/it.)  Dot: Bye everybody.
