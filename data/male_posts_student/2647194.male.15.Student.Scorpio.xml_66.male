Now I'm sick, with a blasphemous (ok, maybe not) cold, complete with sore throat, random ear poppings, and stuffy nose. Needless to say, tea has been a good friend today...  Speaking of the day: -Woke up at 11:30, had Devonshire English Tea and cereal for breakfast, and "stared out the window". literally. That tea is good stuff though-plenty of caffeine. -Road bike to library somewhere around 3:30, and had fun running a red light in Cottage Grove...lol -Found out that Al's bike shop was closed today, as he was on vacation somewhere, so I couldn't get my wheels fixed. -Installed a bike computer. A real pain in the a$$, if I may say. -Had some stupid bland Italian dish for dinner-it wasn't pasta! How can it be Italian if it isn't some kind of pasta?! -Went absolutely nowhere during the evening, which was a good choice. Played Snood for a while, practiced piano/drums, watched SNL, drank yet even more tea (Chamomile with Valerian), and blogged. Geez, I think I have about 25 different kinds of tea here...  So yeah, thats about it. As for, well, later on today, as it is almost 1 in the morning, I'm attending the 10:45 Easter service at Zion Lutheran. As for the rest of the day, I'll try and shake this stupid cold.  Now the only thing I'm missing from my Englishman personality is scones...
