This is kind of exciting because I never cook, although I know how, partially because when I was a kid I was expected to take over making dinner from about age 12. Nobody ever really took the time to teach me what to do or how to do it, so I just putter along and ruin about every 4th endeavor. No, really. Not slightly burned cookies or too many onions in the soup. An hour worth of cooking and a dinner's worth of food, inedible and nicely plated for the garbage. But anyway, since I've been home with my folks I've started cooking again, as my mom is often confined to bed and my dad is like me and would rather eat out or have microwaved something, but mom can't stand the idea of not having some semblance of a June Cleaver experience. Really. She'll spend several hours, most days, fretting about what we're going to eat, just as though it matters. "Oh, I didn't thaw anything, we'll have to go to the store." "Mom, nobody cares. Reheat something. Or don't, we're grownups, we probably will find the will to eat standing up from the fridge before we starve to death." "Well, I just like things to be NICE." Sorry. This was just supposed to be about the nice little roast I cooked and almost didn't ruin.    Grrarg, I am head over heels, rolling down some grass ass hill, tumbling, stumbling in love with Fabi.  He is a real sweetheart.  What better guy to live a life in the loving arms of one's dearest?  And to have the heartbeat in synchronous tune with every beat a harbinger of hope and with that one lover?  And who better then him for that one taste, so sweet in the rising tempo of passion?  And I think only to live, to love and to breathe together - as one... (Sorry, I know, know a little to sappy.  Alas, that s how I feel)  Now we've got racoons! Do you think that the squirrels told the racoons that our house is a great place to crash? Our neighbor told me to look at the little footprints in the snow and follow them. Well, they went right under my back porch! I left a message for the squirrel removers to add TWO RACOONS to their list.  Racoons Eat Squirrels Commonwealth Wildlife Control was here to reset the squirrel trap and set up a racoon trap. Turns out that racoons eat squirrels. Bill, the trapper, says that you don't want racoons. They are worse than squirrels! Bill took the time to point out where the traps were all set and where all the squirrel urine is running down the side of the house. Bill says that squirrel urine will rot up my clapboards. He then went on to tell me about the breeding habits of squirrels and how they have babies in April. The squirrels are now building their nests out of anything they can find including insulation to power lines. That's bad because if they eat through the insulation, a fire could start and your whole house could burn down.  How do you kill grey squirrels?  We'd like to see them captured in a live capture trap then humanely killed by a gun or a blow to the head. Die! Squirrels Die!   5 Minutes on Secret Societies I don't make it a very big secret, I'm completely fascinated by the secret society. The free masons, illuminati, the stone cutters, even the elk's club. There was a part of me that always knew I would be in a fraternity. I was going to become the fourth person in my four person family to join a greek organization. I am still in high school I visited a semi-elite liberal arts school and there I saw one of the coolest things I'd ever seen. This one fraternity house had a huge elk head in its living room that had a secret compartment behind it. That compartment could only be reached by climbing a recessed ladder that started in the basement and went straight up two and half floors. From the head you could look out into the large main room. They showed this to me on my first visit. Me, not pledge, not a rush, not even a freshman but a visiting potential student! Even then I knew something had gone wrong in this house. Somewhere along the lines this brotherhood had really lost site of it's founding values. As I became indoctrinated into a house, more than a year later at a different college, it became clear that the elements of the ritual were considered tedious and as such were to be expedited along as quickly as possible. It was disappointing but still I looked forward to the times when secret handshakes and our one and only secret word were exchanged. We had password riddles and hand signals to spare, none were ever used. After having just watched Old School for the third time it became obvious to me that forming a new secret society could be done. Unfortunately it could no longer be based on social crutches associated with the college fraternity. I would need to find like minded individuals interested in forming a brotherhood even a sisterhood with the purpose of secrecy. The question becomes why do it? Why even form a society with no purpose other than to not let people know you've formed the society? We need something to protect, some secret to keep, even some group to persecute to give us meaning. Persecution does not seem to be the most alluring option of the limited field I have mentioned but what if the group being pursued is fictional. Phantoms, figments, complete farces? What if members of our society do something as mundane as dress in ghoulish outfits and scare the wits out of co-eds? After a few sightings of the supernatural a group emerges to hunt and dispel the monsters. The group begins to recruit very carefully and soon legend spreads about a secret cult of vampire hunters and witch neutralizers. The handful of men and women in charge of this sect are in fact the very people responsible for the phantasms, goblins, and lycanthropes that have suddenly emerged. While the new recruits only know their charge of defending the innocent. After a few years with new blood and the occasional "sighting" the tradition could carry on for years without aid from the founders.  I believe that that is something that can be done on a college campus or even a small town and I would love to try it.  Or form one now!  I will do that!  You see it isn’t that hard, start small then, grow!  Lol, my little secret society, I can’t tell you who will be in it, that is a secret, and the purpose is to be secret!  So, I am off to my secret society that is a secret, so SHHH.
