Today we had ITEDs (Iowa Tests of Educational Development). I did those with no real troubles. After that I went to Chemistry and did some of that stuff....nothing fun. Then Cellular Biology. Oh maybe that is where it all began.  This class was one of my favorites at the beginning of the year, I mean I had and A (and roughly still do). But I had to job shadow and I guess we have a test on something like Cellular Respiratory summin er another.... But I wasn't there for the notes and I dont have barely any of them. It kinda makes me mad...but nothing too bad. It wasn't until about 2 days ago that I realized that I didn't know anything. Some of the pot-heads in my class know more about this shit than I do. We played Jeopardy, and I didnt know anything. After answering 2 questions incorrectly everyone looked at me and said you are so stupid and all this stuff....so I just blurted out "I DONT GIVE A SHIT....JUST SHUT UP!!!"  Then everyone was like...JEEZ SPAZ! And thats about it...I got pissed off and just left the class for a while. Then there was lunch and I went and sat with Jadie, and all her whiney friends (especially Emilee) were complaining as usual. I just said, "WHY DO YOU COMPLAIN SO MUCH!!! ITS SO ANNOYING!!!"  Then in STAG (student teacher advisory group) I was reading the Bible and I had on some reading glasses. First I got asked about my glasses....and then someone asked me why I would read the Bible...I about went nuts again...(and yes it was Emilee once again that pissed me off)  Band was no fun cuz I'm so bad at the trumpet....and I dont really want to keep playing...cuz well...I'm bad. And then when my All-Pro gaywad sister sits behind me its not that great!   Footnote : I have lived in my sister's shadow all my life. Every class I have my teachers are all like...'Oh I hope you are just like your sister!!!' I just do my own thing (I'm averaged...unlike my know-it-all sister). Teachers act all disappointed with me like...oh...thats too bad...you could do so much better...I'm just like...nope. I even had one teacher tell me...'Its too bad that you aren't anything like your sister....she is so great!'  After school I had a basketball and a football meeting. Our Varsity coach said that the freshmen would be getting upgraded to Varsity...and I think that is so stupid...but Im not the coach so whatever. Then After all that mumbo-jumbo I went to Jadie's and had a great time watching her do homework....then I got bored so I went at watched TV....Nothing good on...so Jadie comes in and is trying to cheer me up or summin and like rough-hosue with me...needless to say the day I had made me pretty pissed off...there fore rough-housing = NO! And I left later in a nice display of asshole-ness...not a good day....not only did I practically go nuts in a few of my classes...but Jadie probably is beginnning to realize that I am not that great of a boyfriend...I think I am having another phase of depression...not cool.  Oh yeah...when I got home my mom yelled at me for getting a D in school. She expects me to be just like my sister...but I told her the more she rags on me and tries to force me to be like Anne (my sister) the more I am going to be NOT like her. Which means that I am gonna just pretty much just gonna....grrr....  Who the hell do you all think you are anyways!!!
