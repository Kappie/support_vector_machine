It contains argument for why companies currently are moving from a decentralization towards a centralization of information systems.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * After a decentralization trend of information systems in the 1980s and 1990s, more and more companies are now moving towards recentralization of the IT recourses. No longer are IT operations merely a solver of efficiency problems and other unit crisis at factory floors, call centers, and other parts of a business. Now, as expressed by Stephanie Stahl (2004), “cost cutting, intense ROI demands, … and other factors are driving a new level of automation and efficiency within the core IT department.” While the decentralization increased local sensitivity, costs and control bolted away. Therefore, to gain improved control over resources and budget, “these departments are [now expected to] incorporate the constant improvement and process optimization in their own operations”.  According to Darrell Dunn (2004), more than three out of four managers consider obtaining better return on IT investment a top priority for their companies. Taking that objective into account, automating more information systems, thereby “boosting utilization rates, cutting costs, reducing downtime, [and] speeding up application … deployments”, saves both valuable time and money. Another advantage by centralizing systems is that companies can more swiftly spot trends. Dunn describes, for example, how consumer electronics retailer Best Buy Co. uses a centralized program to monitor activities in its more than 600 stores. With help of the program, Best Buy can quickly recognize recurring problem and swiftly assess whether it is global in nature or limited to one store or one region. This has, additionally, reduced help-desk volume, thereby saving both money and increasing customer satisfaction.  Dunn, D. (2004, July 12). Automating the IT factory. InformationWeek.com.
