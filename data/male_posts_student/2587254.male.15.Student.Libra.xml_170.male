Spider Keys, Dichomotus keys, GAAH BIOLOGY!   This whole day has been revolving around SBI 3U1. Whether if it was the studying in the library, the one hour @ Head 2 Head games, or after school studyin' with Tehm and Lilian...it was biology. Yeah...this whole day my brain's been filled with stuff like the saccharides, cloning, the different systems in the human body, etc. And to think that after the exam tomorrow I gotta cram in the formulas for math. Not that that will be hard, but still it won't be that fun. Today wasn't bad though...the studying actually helped alot. Plus just having some quiet time in the morning reading out of the Daily Inspiration PDL *recently found out I got summarized version of PDL, which is already summarized. Therefore Summary of a summary* and sipping a large java from Timmy's and havin some timbits. It wasn't that bad, and I feel somewhat well prepared for tomorrow...if not totally haha...  So this morning I decided I'd wake up and head to library for morning studies at 9am. So ggot up at about 830, got ready and headed out the door. Bought timbits and coffee at Timmy's for breakfast and then headed to library with my food and books.  So started off my studies with a quick word of prayer, and then decided to read a few verses from PDL. Finished off the section about how we are all part of God's family, and re-read some of the previous stuff also. Then begun my studying...  Gargh....cramming all the biology from the whole year back in my head. At least I can focus today and not have a headache bugging me. So looked over old tests, filled in some wrong answers, tried some review. Apparently I know most of the stuff on the review, so I'm assuming I should be ok for the final evaluation. Plus the quizzes on Mr. Kimmel's site helped alot, so I should be ok for tomorrow. An hour and a half quickly zoomed by, and before I knew it I had to make the descision of whether I should go to school or not. Eventually I decided I would, so I packed my things and trekked my way to school.  Music class today...yup about 6 of us lol. Thompson called 10 mins into class not realizing class started, and then quickly drove down to school. Today we just sorted out music, and listened to Niki's Eagles CD. Justin brought his guitar, and played a few things, and yeah 40 minutes passed real quickly. Gave away the crappy Timbits that I dared not to touch *the plain ones* and also chatted with the others guess you can say one last time before summer started.  Science I didn't really go to since well basically no one was there. only 5 of us, so me, John and Hammond said a thanks to Mr. Curphey *he was an awesome teacher* and then me and John and Pourier would head to Head 2 Head...had to fuel my craving for BF Vietnam. For some reason I felt like gaming lol. But before leaving I read this:   Curphey's Law  1. I am always right 2. If I am ever wrong, refer to rule 1 3. I am perfect 4. If you disagree, refer to rule 1 to 3   I thought that was great. Oh yeah him and Mrs. Wharton both got these funny award certificates from the group known as the "United Pricks." It was the thing used for their 007 film on film night, consisted of Fed, Matt Brown, Dave Rutt and some other gr. 12's that are graduating. The awards were pretty funny though.  Anyways like I said we got bored so we went off to Head 2 Head games to play some BFV. While there today I grabbed a 1 month membership just to try it out, plus it was a deal. Free half hour and I only had to pay 2 bucks for the extra half hour needed to make a full one hour. Plus I got a membership ^_^. Starting BFV, which took a while, we finally got underway after about five minutes, since we had some server problems and for some reason the computers kept rebooting for no reason. As I mentioned before this whole ady was about biology, so me being the geeky biology freak I decided to make my largely intimidating BFV name "Monosaccharide." Anyways so we played for an hour, and then I headed back to school for some bio review since I had bio then.  There were 10 of us in that class lol. Yeah so went over a few questions. I FINALLY GET PROTEIN SYNTHESIS! All thanks to this really weird puzzle thing Ms. Wiener had. Also I feel special that I know taxonomy...and I got to help people w/ it haha. Usually I'm the pretty stupid one...BUT I ACTUALLY KNOW STUFF NOW! Muahahaha! Pretty much only gr. 10's where there, but meh we still got some review packed in. After bio me, Tehm and Lilian then went to the library to study. Ok correction...Tehm Lilian and I, for those English freaks out there.  Arriving at the library around 130...ish, we get there and immediately dive into our books. That was when I realize at 2pm that I had to run back to school to order my CD's still lol. So ran back to school, and then quickly ran back to the library in 10 minutes or so *our school and the library is very close.* Tehm went to grab 4 burger from Arby's in total through the time plus some various other foods, while for some reason my craving for some proteins, carbs, cholestrol, lipids etc. died out while studying. We talked about lots of stuff, from Chinese restaurants to Tehm and Lilian talking about the weird people they see walking in and out of the public washroom that was facing our study table. Yeah like I said...WIDE variety of talking subjects haha. So after two hours of studying, we all went on our different paths to our homes.  Arriving home, I finish up some brief studying, watched some TV, drummed, relaxed a bit, ate, and also managed a 30 minute nap.  Waking up at 8pm, I showered and once again resumed my studying. From then till now (11:37pm) I've been cramming in stuff like capillary fluid exchange, plants, and other stuff into my head once again. Pray for my bio exam if you people can, and back to my studying hehe.  Good luck on your exams too people.  Later.
