By 'this', he meant doing this blog. Heck, the only reason I've made a return to this was cux Jose told me if I went back to blog, I'd get an invite for g-mail.  For all who are out of the loop, it's e-mail that's...uhh..it's got 1 gig of space, and the motto? "The Keyword: Search, don't sort." I WANT THAT ONE GIG!...=( Hey, it's useful for all the "junk" that I get.  Ken's taunting me about my sucky laptop again. Why do I feel so sad? =P...oh heck..well, back to whatever I'm doing..so yeah...I'm out. Probably update again, later.
