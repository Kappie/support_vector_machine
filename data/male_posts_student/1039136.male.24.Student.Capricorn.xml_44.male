I think right now there's so many feelings and things that i've kept inside, pushed aside or chose not to face that all of it is built up somewhere inside and systematically draining me emotionally. Over the last few weeks I have been more short tempered, more impatient, and just feeling wrong overall.  Things just aren't in order in my head. I think it would take some sort of vacation to put everything in order.  I'm kind of afraid what will be come of my sanity if I don't get away from it all and pull myself together.      Aside from that,   Friday I went to the Kerry rally. Old people dropped left and right because of the extreme heat and a lack of water due to poor planning on Scranton's part.  Made for great comedy. As Ray put it, the song of the day was "Another one bites the dust" by Queen. I hope people locally got a better idea of what Kerry's platform is. He really seems to represent a new america..thats what this country needs. Bush took this country and basically made it his whore. Now Whoremerica is laying in the gutter, as people walk by and spit on her.  It's a sad thing that doesn't sit well with me.  I've never been so interested in politics in my entire life. Well..then again..my mother claims that when I was little I would watch Ted Koppel newscasts at nauseum and would be glued to the Tv during a Regan speech, but in hindsight, the one thing on Tv I remember watching the most was Dr. Ruth.  Sex and Politics baby, thats my platform..lol   Just remember, there's not politics involved when it comes to beer.   Last night..there was a WHOLE LOT of beer...and jello shots..and everything else.    It was a great party. I was pretty much the equivalent to a fraternities "social" as I did all the ground work for the people there. It was a good drunken night, topped off with me spouting off some shit to people that deserved it.  I always say..alcohol takes away that little filter that would,  in normal circumstances, make me shut up. This ties in with the first part of this post. I really need to work out whatever the hell is eating a hole in me before I end up being swiss cheese.  I think overall it was a good weekend. I'm just not looking forward much to work tomorrow. There's alot of stress involved in starting a new business and unfortunately there is alot of work being pushed on me since i'm one of only 2 employees of the company currently. Me and my coworker Sarah have been starting to vent to each other more about Maria and this fucking job, so its helping keeping both of us sane. So...if you see me walking slower than normal, thats just the weight of the future success of the company on my shoulders.      I was told last night that i'm too hard on myself. Maybe I need to take that to heart...but really I dont know how. I dont really know what "being too hard on oneself" is...and its possible that I am..I just dont know what that means and how to stop....      Well i'm going to end this post now..and go back to singing Rent and thinking about life.   Keep it real homies.        "One song   Glory   One song   Before I go   Glory   One song to leave behind   Find one song   One last refrain   Glory   From the pretty boy front man   Who wasted opportunity...   Find glory   Beyond the cheap colored lights   One songBefore the sun sets   Glory -- on another empty life   Time flies -- time dies   Glory -- One blaze of glory   Find   GloryIn a song that rings true   Truth like a blazing fire   An eternal flame   Find   One song   A song about love   GloryFrom the soul of a young man   A young man   Find   The one song   Before the virus takes hold   GloryLike a sunset   One song   To redeem this empty lifeTime flies   And then - no need to endure anymore   Time dies"-Rent
