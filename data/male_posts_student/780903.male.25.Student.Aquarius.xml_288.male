Sat through a meeting this evening regarding the "public interest auction," which students are required to give 6 hours of work towards in order to get summer funding in the event we have a summer job that does not pay.  We were asked to rank our choice of 11 committees, 8 of which sounded remarkably similar:  (and, yes, I'm building up to a joke here...)  1. Students -- phone bank where you will call students and beg for donations to the auction 2. Firms -- phone bank where you will call law firms and beg for donations to the auction 3. Corporations -- phone bank where you will call corporations and beg for donations to the auction 4. Alumni -- phone bank where you will call alumni and beg for donations to the auction 5. Faculty -- phone bank where you will call faculty and beg for donations to the auction 6. Special Projects -- phone bank where you will call famous people and beg for donations to the auction 7. Media -- phone bank where you will call newspapers and magazines and beg for publicity for the auction 8. Silent auction -- phone bank with TDD for the hearing impaired  (yes, that was the joke I was building towards...)
