Last night after work George and I went to  Fuddruckers . Man, that place makes awesome burgers. Sure it's $10 for a meal, but everything is simply delicious. 2/3 lb. hamburger, potato wedge fries and a drink. Afterwards we had some beer at my place while watching some TV.  Today, Derek and I plan on going to see some UPW featuring Rowdy Roddy Piper.  **
