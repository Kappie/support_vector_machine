So, I got disappointed and just said "screw it" so we went back to the other lake (Murray Lake is two lakes), and went for a swim at around 8:30.  I have been going to Murray Lake since I was in my mother's womb, so there are alot of memories there.  So, it was fun.  My mom always seems to be out late, she is probably partying or something haha.  I notice nobody comments anymore.  Feel free to comment on anything, maybe even right now just to see if anybody even reads this :/....
