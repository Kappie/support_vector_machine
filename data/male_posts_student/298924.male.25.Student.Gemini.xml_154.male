School is going well...been taking more pictures than the law should allow....and well I'm enjoying where my young lady friend is taking me (most of the time)....  In short, although Death paid me a visit in the past month, Life hasn't treated me this well in a long time....  On another note....in my time at Morehouse I met some interesting people....however perhaps no one was more interesting than  urlLink the homie Faraji ....Raj has entered the wonderful world of blogging....Raj is one of the three best writers I know (now if we could just get Joe from Dallas to start blogging)....keep an eye on his life of "swarth and excess"....  That reminds me of the good old days....when words like swarthyness, coonery, debauchery, and stunnage were fixtures in my very unscholarly vocabulary....I really can't wait for Homecoming so I can be reminded of the memories created in Atlanta as a college student....the days of being a psuedo-celeb (if Raj was a third tier celeb I guess I must have been on the fifth or sixth tier) and balling on a budget....the days when we created a VIP list and there were no such things as delusions of granduer....  Anyway....for the sake of my obsession with smelling good all of the time it is time to overpay to wash and dry my clothes....later for this site
