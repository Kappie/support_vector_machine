Then after school we waited until 5:00 and then we went to the dinner thing. We had KFC lol. Some people were dressed up really nice. Stacey wore a nice black dress and she looked real pretty. Oh yeah I almost forgot, the black lady came in to talkl about sex. We talked about why we should and shouldn't have sex. When we were doing why we shouldn't she was like "Don't have sex with them if they have 'coochie critters.'" LMFAO omg that was so funny. Yeah so back to the dance. After the dinner we all went to the gym for the dance. I was going with STacey and Tim W. was going with Paola. So when we got there in the beginning I felt like such a LOSER because I was to shy to dance. I think Tim was to because when Paola would try to dance with him he would silently asy to me "Please help!" But the only problem was I felt the same way. I wanted to dance so badly but I don't know.....I was shy lol. But then later on I kinda loosened up a bit. So I had a really good time with Stacey and when we were slow dancing I wanted to give her a kiss but like I said im too fucking shy. Yeah so that was my day and I am really sad cause' I dont want her to move....*sigh*
