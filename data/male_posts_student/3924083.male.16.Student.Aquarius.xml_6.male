Let me just say this, I have no problem with females, about half my best friends are females, so thats kewl, its only when you get onto the whole subject of relationships that things start to go wrong. Im talking about the mixed signals, the fact that you never, ever know whats going on. It really feels like you are trying to swim through treacle blindfolded. Case in point, recently I started to talk to this girl, apparently she had liked me for ages and ages and was crazy about me, so we meet up and everything goes well, this is great im thinking, its so simple and i know exactly whats going on. But NO, that isnt going to happen, about a week and a half passes and i dont hear from her. I give her a few calls but i cant get through to her. Finally she eventually does contact me, she says she lost my number, this is great im thinking, i know exactly whats going on, but NO! I ask her if she wants to meet up again, the response is muted and she keeps going on about the amount of work she is doing, finally she just stops texting me. A few days later and she texts again, she says she was out of credit, ok i think, this is fine, so i just ask her again if she wants to meet up, she says she is now working full time seven days a week, i suggest after work and there is no answer, this is where i am at right now. Why hasn't she answered me? And heres my point, this girl, according to everything ive been told by at least 3 friends (trustworthy ones) was absoloutly crazy about me, apparently she dumped her boyfriend  to be with me, so what the hell is going on? Have i done something wrong? Is she just messing me around? I need help!
