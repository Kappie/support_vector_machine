I've tried to begin and maintain a routine like this before but quit after several days, but I feel like I can push myself to continue doing and enjoying this.  It helps me stay fit, and it feels good to be active too--instead of sitting at home all day everyday [which is what I do anyway]  I've kept a log of my running...Something like this:  DATE			DISTANCE		TIME		DESCRIPTION  TU 2004-07-06		3 laps (1.2 miles)	N/A		N/A  WE 2004-07-07		3 laps (1.2 miles)	N/A		N/A  TH 2004-07-08		3 laps (1.2 miles)	N/A		The first time I've run a whole lap without stopping.  FR 2004-07-09		3 laps (1.2 miles)	15:00		Unfortunately, I didn't run a lap without stopping.  SA 2004-07-10		3 laps (1.2 miles)	13:23		Ran first lap without stopping; saw Sammy  Lauren!  SU 2004-07-11		3 laps (1.2 miles)	13:34		Ran both first  second lap without stopping.  So good luck to me! :) And good day to you.. !
