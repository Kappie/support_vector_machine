You gave me a slight bump   in the head and in the heart   when I noticed you smile at me.      We've been friends for a long time,   and that span of the time   we've known each other very well   and I know that it's selfish to say   "could we be more than friends?"      I know it's selfish   but could we give it a try?      So please,   knowing you turned to loving you   and I can't help but to try! To Try!!      To try! I can't help but to try!      To Try! To Try!   It wouldn't hurt to try!      It may be risky,   it may be fruitful,   it may be dreadful,   but can we please try      To risk our friendship,   a new relationship!      I know we can work it out!!!!    >>>I wrote this song while listening to my Dashboard Confessional Collection and I suddenly thought, "I could make a song like that!" Then I took a pen and paper and started writing everything that came to my mind. This song relates to what happened to me in my high school days. It was when my barkada, "Alphappogi" (hello guys!), went to Cubao after school to buy things for our CAT and while walking along Lantana St., my friends realized and found out that I have a crush on Joanne. Wow! Lupet nila makahalata because the two of us ( Joanne and Me) was walking and they were a a few steps ahead of us. So parang nasa hulihan kaming dalawa at naguusap. Biglang nagsalita si Byron na "jay, may sasabihin ako sayo. Sating tatlo lang to nila Regil.." Nagtaka ako kung bakit at naisip ko baka nahuli na nila ako. Sabi ni Byron, "Halata ka Chong!" sabi ko, "Saan?" sabi niya, "basta halata ka!" biglang dumating si reg at sinabi "Chong JOCO ka!" at doon nauso ang 'JOCO'. kaya yun, tapos biglang mejo nagkakailangan kame ni Joanne nun pero nginingitian niya ako nun kaya "I noticed you smile at me.." diba? Parang iniisip ko nun na maski magkabarkada kame pwede naman maging kame diba? If we'll risk our friendship, the caterpillar might become a butterfly or it would die. Gets? May possibility na magkagulo ang friendship namen o kaya maging kame at magbloom. Astig noh? bakit ko ineexplain ito? mushy ung song pero nakakaadik (imagine an artist addicted to his own work) walalang..Tungkol dun sa araw na un ung song..Parang tinatanong ko sa sarili ko na itry namen. Sabi naman ni kumpareng TEB na "magkakapatid tayo dito. ikaw ba papatulan mo kapatid mo?" Pero ok na un. We decided to go for it, tignan mo ngaun it worked ouyt just fine!Astig diba? walalang. Share ko lang..
