Even when we started becoming a new she still only played with my heart and still lied in my face. But thankfully I have a friend that stupidly would tell him and seemed to "forget" when she would talk to me. This time I think.... NO ... I know what I want to do. I don't want to be like her and Travis are. I don't want to be acquaintances. NO.                                                                                                                                             NO... I need her out of my life forever
