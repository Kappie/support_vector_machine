No, to be sleepy on a grassy hill the breath coming over you, warming you, cooling you. I want to sit by a window watching the sun set through the drops on the glass. No, I want it to be dark out. Let me be sleepy and let there be a soft couch. Let her sing me to sleep. I want one more thing. You to be there holding my hand.  Drama today was a waste of time and I got ticked coz I observed them. I'm full of skepticism. It's my fault. I want to be simple, to be stupid, not to notice you in the corner playing chess with yourself. I think I know you.  Jo's still cold. This hurts. Let rain fall from concrete coloured skies. The more we keep this up, the further we'll drift apart. I don't think telling the truth all the time is a good thing. I tell it as it is and I hurt. I lost that which comes before sunrise and now Jo's going too.  I want a good body and T-shit weather.
