I was fascinated at the impact and attraction it had to them and out of curiousity, started reading it! Since the moment I had my hands on it, I couldn't stop! It was simply too irresistable!    The story begins in a concealed village, where a young man hides within a bunch of "leaves". His name is Uzumaki Naruto, a mischievous boy attending the Ninja Academy.  Everyday, he does nothing but causes mischief and making Iruka-sensei mad. And above all, it's doubtful that he'll be able to graduate from the Academy. But Naruto has a dream... A dream that he'll become the head of the Ninja village, following Hokage and will become the best ninja around!  However, all the adults in the village give Naruto cold looks. The truth is, Naruto has a secret about his birth. 12 years ago,  "Kyuubi no Youko"  (Nine Tailed Fox - A kind of evil spirit who tormented the village, was sealed within Naruto's body who was, at the time, a baby. The head of the academy, Mizuki, uses Naruto to steal the "Fuujin Scrolls" and makes Naruto understand his past. Naruto is outraged.  Even with Iruka's help, Naruto just barely defeats Mizuki. Knowing Naruto's secret, Iruka knows Naruto will meet someone who'll help him and so, makes a decision. Naruto is allowed to graduate safely from Ninja Academy. Along with his classmates, Uchiwa Sasuke and Haruno Sakura together, they make their first step as Ninjas!   The following are some of the themes in the manga which I felt are touching and have an underlying meaning to our lifes.      Theme 1  "Hard Work"  Lee's theme is hard work. People think that hard work is lame these days but that's not the case. The author wanted to express that hard work pays off.     Theme 2  "Believe in Yourself"  Humans are separated by differences they are born with but the author want to believe that people can change and wanted to express that. Hinata's theme is "by believing in yourself, you can become a new person."     Theme 3  "Destiny Is .. ?"  The theme for the Neji-Naruto fight is "destiny." The author wanted to express the difference between Neji who believed that destiny can't be changed and suffers within that belief and Naruto who lives to change destiny while looking forward.
