It's probably not the best film, but interesting nonetheless.  Song--  "Backdoor Lover" from the movie  Josey and the Pussycats  I know this is really random and devoid of value, but I was flipping channels the other day and saw this song on the movie. I'd forgotten how funny it was.  Book--  Young, Black, Rich  Famous  by Todd Boyd Talks about racism  stereotypes in modern day basketball. I read it for my thesis, and while I want to quote the book just about every other paragraph, I don't know if the people at Baylor will like it. You see, Dr. Boyd combines the language of the academic with the language that he learned growing up as a black male, and it makes for interesting reading. In fact, I was blown away by some of the stuff in the book-- remember Rasheed Wallace talking about being a slave for white owners? The book talks about this very subject...
