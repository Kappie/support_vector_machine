I was expecting some dramatic performance like those in the past years' National Day Parade, but I was severely mistaken. There were just a lot of formations and stuff, and I would have appreciated it if only the cameras in the National Stadium didn't start crapping up! The performances were ho-hum, and the commenters were like running off a script on how patriotic and enthusiastic the crowd was, and how "moved" they were by the "meaningful" performances. I hate propaganda in any form, and this clearly can be seen here. The stage, even, was said to be "specially designed for the performances on hand", but I say, why the hell are the ramps there? No vehicle ever goes up there, no one in fact even walks up there in the first place! So all that "artwork" and "effort" has gone into creating a stage that is ab-so-lute-ly useless? What's more, they even remixed just about every song, and it was only towards the end of the parade were the original ones played! At first I though, ah okay, only a few songs remixed, but it turned out that nearly all of the songs - yes,  nearly all  - were remixed! Does anyone know how much I hate remixes already? Remixes are really just good songs ruined by techno and so-called "upbeat" rythmns, and now they have to do that to these national songs and take away the element of emotion and patriotism! Aren't 39 years enough for any of us to learn anything? Does USA remix their national songs? Does Malaysia even alter their songs? Why do  we  have to do it then? That aside, the only interesting part was the fireworks session. 6,000 different types of fireworks from all over the globe, converged to one small island for a short 3 and a half minute display. Nothing great? Well, at least the variety of fireworks kept me happy enough. There were these comets and sub-shell fireworks (small firework shells packed into a firework shell - something like submunitions in weapons), plus a variety of other treats for the eyes. GWG woudl probably like to note that a notable number of these came from Australia! Oh well, gotta go!
