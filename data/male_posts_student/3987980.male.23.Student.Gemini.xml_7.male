This afternoon I removed my broken alternator and brought it to an autoparts shop. Got me a new alternator and put it in my car. With a little jump for the battery, my car was up and running again. Battery does need to be properly recharged, but since I needed to get to Calculus for the test today I will do it tomorrow after my Programming class. I still have to find that coolant leak, though.  Speaking of Calculus, I'm glad I only have one more class of it after tonight. I do dread it, plus I never did like night classes. I get home and I feel like I should have hours to just be alone, but NO! I have to sleep right away for my Programming class in the morning. Its hell I tell ya. I'm so tired from all the work I've had to endure the past few days from my car, I just want to relax. Sunday and Monday, my days off....after class tomorrow I can finally relax. With my car up and running I was able to get to the bank! With my cash allowance I get for food in hand, I put some in the bank and kept a bit for food (I hadn't eatten all day and was late for class...I went to Wendy's anyway. FOOD!) So with some cash in the bank, I can finally reactivate my account with Skotos! I like to roleplay and its a great place for it. I love Castle Marrach and The Eternal City they host. Both are MUDs, but they are the best around. Plus I can play Underlight because of Skoto's Partnership program they do with other companies, like Lyra Studios that runs Underlight. Unfortunately, Underlight is getting worse and worse as time marches on. It's so far behind in technology that it is shocking it still is around. Its a roleplaying game, too, but its graphical. But the graphics are over a decade old using 2.5D engine for the environment and sprites for everything else. It was a great game, but as MMO's go you need to upgrade the system before you get 10 years behind everything else. Its too low on players, and only a fraction of those players are even worth playing with most of the time. I'll probably spend more time with Castle Marrach and play a little The Eternal City here and there. Castle Marrach uses a small environment to enhance the social atmosphere. The game doesn't have monsters or anything, its about living in a castle and climbing the strict social latter...or not. Some people choose to stay the lowly 11th rank (which means you have no rank). Rank usually means work, cause you won't have a high rank if you aren't important to the castle. I have two characters: the first is Jonci (original isn't it), a swordsman before finding himself at the castle. He is usually depressed due to the lack of freedom he feels he has trapped in the castle. The other is Syrio, a thief in his life before Castle Marrach and a woman-chaser. During his first week he was rejected 13 times by women! Probably a record! Then he found a strange dark woman that kinda tortured him a couple of times (she put Syrio in the stocks for the promise of a kiss...she didn't deliver). This blog has gotten way off topic and very long, I'm gonna cut it for now and leave something to talk about later.
