"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."  -Frank Herbert  "Fear is that little darkroom where negatives are developed."  -Michael Pritchard  (this will always remind me of that night, when i felt safe, loved, cherished...and most of all--happy that God had blessed me...)  Lifehouse: Everything   Finally here once speak to me I want to feel you, I need to hear you You are the light that's leading me to the place Where I find peace again You are the strength that keeps me walking You are the hope that keeps me trusting You are the light to my soul You are my purpose You're everything and how can I stand here with you And not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better than this You calm the storms and you give me rest You hold me in your hands You won't let me fold You still my heart when you take my breath away Would you take me in take me deeper now And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better than this And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better than this Cause you're all I want, you're all I need You're everything.. everything You're all I want You're all I need You're everything.. everything You're all I want You're all I need You're everything.. everything You're all I want You're all I need You're everything.. everything And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better than this And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better any better than this And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you Would you tell me how could it be any better than this Would you tell me how could it be any better than this
