The trip costs 24 rubles and 2 sheep. With any luck, I will see the barstool formally known as Scott Parker. If so, I have devised a list of questions I could ask him.  1. When in primary school, did you play Judas in the Easter play? 2. Why are you such a devious back-stabbing tosser? 3. How does it feel to lose your place in the England team when supposedly leaving a small club to go to a bigger club? 4. Why did you throw back in Alan Curbishley's face, everything he has done for you, making you the player you are, just for a bit more money, you wanker?  So, I look forward to being able to direct my questions at the man, hopefully I will upset and embarrass him enough to take his own life by jumping off his wallet.
