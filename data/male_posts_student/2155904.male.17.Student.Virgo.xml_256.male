Wow, blogging has not been fun for like a week now cuz Tyke has been talking to so many people online that he never has time to focus on this.  So Tyke got up at 12:30 this morning, set up a play date with Macaroon (changed that a little later on) and then helped his brother bring in his old mattress.  That took a while and he then had to eat before leaving for his haircut.  After that he went to Macaroon's house and picked him up cuz he had nothing to do cuz his play date went kaputz earlier on.  Dairy Queen was the next stop as Tyke got an impromptu lunch and then went to meet his mom at Fry's Electronics in Renton to look mainly at printers.  They got some good looks in and then Tyke got a laptop backpack (has a special place for the laptop in the backpack) and a cover for his laptop as well.  But the coolest buy was some video editing software Tyke has needed to get.  It will be pretty useful as Tyke mom wants him to convert old VHS and tapes to digital stuff so that they will actually get used.  So she jumped all over the product.  It was kinda funny actually.  Tyke didn't think they were going to actually buy it today but they did.  It was about 250 bucks and Tyke's mom thinks she'll be getting the  real  Photoshop soon too.  The $650 version.  Or it's 650 at Fry's at least.  After Fry's Tyke went into Bellevue with Macaroon to drop Tyke's car off for a servicing and picking up his brother's car.  So it was just a straight swap, but an upgrade in car and sound system.  Then they met Dr. Phil and Amed at Red Robin in Factoria and got dinner there.  After that they went up to Macaroon's house and hung out there.  They played Monopoly where Tyke's shitty streak of luck continued and he got 3 straight rolls where he landed on somebody's property that was already built on.  It was quite sucky.  They also played Mario Tennis and Gauntlet Legends though so that was cool.  Gauntlet Legends was fun for a while but then it was just all of a sudden super late it seemed and everyone split.  Then Tyke came home and tried out the stuff he got at Fry's.  And basically, even if it didn't sound busy, Tyke was pretty busy today.  Doing something from waking up until coming home at midnight.  Not a bad day overall.
