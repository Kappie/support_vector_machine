Jason did a lesson on the song "Can He Still Feel The Nails?" and man.  it really makes ya think.  it puts a different perspective on it.  like... everytime you sin you're basically hurting Jesus.  you're sayin "hey bud, You died for me but i still wanna have fun, do what i wanna do, so i'm just gonna yanno put ya on hold for a bit."  i cant imagine what Jesus thinks sometimes.  when i screw up.  there is no way i could ever understand what He feels... when i hurt someone's feelings.  ugh... just the thought that Jesus hurts because of my mistakes makes me sick.  makes ya think bout how you're living... doesnt it?
