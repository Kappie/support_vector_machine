Once again, for another 2 hours, looking for those Windows 98 modem drivers my computer somehow "lost." Mind you, I'm trying to hook up an Ethernet connection with the thing, and why it needs modem drivers is apparantly not my business.  A nice walk to the bank to pick up my seventeen dollars! My, what brisk weather!  My laundry mission continues. I am washing every stray piece of clothes in the house; unclaimed articles will be devoted to the Salvation Army. I'm on my 15th load right now.  Called AAA about buying train tickets in the Netherlands. Surprisingly, they knew what I was talking about.  Reading about the mythical story of Murder Creek, kind of our local ghost story. Check it out at www.geocities.com/newstea...ciety.htm.  Thinkin' 'bout stuff.  Looking into this har thing with the cable that wut brings broadband into my home. Broadband? Is that like, uh, the Andrews Sisters?  Trying to appease my rabid blog fans--all five of them.  "JeffIM: are you on your laptop/  TomServo0: YES i am.  JeffIM: nimbavirus.exe  JeffIM: then click that!"
