School days were so tiring but substantial. I did a lot of sports. I studied hard in school but not at home. I felt so tired that I was not willing to do anything but to sleep. This week, I didn’t spend my time with SUN, because I had to teach my classmate math. But I got 100 yuan in return. She has already had her exam. Hope she passed it. And I will get some more money because I help others to do some other things. I started to earn money. That’s what I was so excited about!  I remember my first ‘salary’. When I was in junior school, we went out and performed for a big supermarket for a whole morning. I got just poor 5 yuan. At first we could not get that. It was supposed to buy us lunch box. But they decided to give it to us instead of buying lunch for us. Then I happily left there with my first ‘salary’ in the hand. After I got home, I put it in a big book carefully. I didn’t use it. It’s still in the piano book. This time, when I got the money, I asked SUN, with whom I spent my noontime, to go to Mc…. We spent 36.
