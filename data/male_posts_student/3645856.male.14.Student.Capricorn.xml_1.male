Firt up was nelson  urlLink   who played a few acoustic songs (well... they're pretty much folk musicians) that went to the top ten charts in the US and in other countries of the world. Peter Frampton... god... I mean... that guy is getting old, but he's lively as hell. I mean... just his attitude. Coupled with the fact that I actually met him right after. Styx was loud. I mean unbelievably loud... and Lawrence Gowan came out dressed in a Mountie's jacket (he's canadian)... oh, and during peter frampton's set, Tommy Shaw was the one handing him his guitars and everything. There were, as Peter said, a lot of hijinks going on, as it was the last show of the Frampton/Nelson/Styx tour. And I forgot to mention, for those of you who don't know, Gunnar and Matthew Nelson are the two sons of Rick Nelson... and their grandparents were also top 10 musicians. They hold the Guiness Book of World Records for the only three generations to hip #1 on the charts.  Other than the concert, post concert, I bought a tour shirt and my dad got a shirt and a hat and the Peter Frampton part of the concert was actually recorded there and he bought a copy of that. I'm actually listening to it right now.  We got lost a few times and spent about an hour trying to get back on interstate 64.  I want to see another concert there this year. I liked that amphitheatre (this was actually my first time at the virginia beach amphitheatre. Anywho, I swam for about an hour before the concert at the oceanfront on 17th street in VA Beach. To tell you the truth, it wasn't really crowded until it got later there. I think styx was a little overkill on the bass. They had 7 ampeg full bass stack amplifiers. 6 Marshall stacks for the guitars.... that was a bit under. They need more like 12 marshalls. The drums and the bass in unison were rattling my ears after the concert and everything that was trebly was rattling my ears. Peter Frampton has a guitar that's one serial number off of mine (a Gibson Les Paul 1960 RI... something I already knew)... but his had like... midi and roland synthesizer stuff on it and mine has pickup covers. Anywho... anough of my babbling.  Music - While My Guitar Gently Weeps - Peter Frampton Mood - (lmao, I actually typed food before when I meant mood) Hungry... I haven't eaten anything since two pm yesterday.... so I haven't eaten in almost 24 hours. Other than that, i'm tired and my hearing is still screwed up, but overall, i'm quite satisfied and happy.
