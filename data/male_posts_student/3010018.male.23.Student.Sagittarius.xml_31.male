I really found all the comments of my previous Religion entry so thought provoking that I decided to respond to them here as opposed to the comment form. And i threw in some more of my thoughts on religion.  Once aliens come to Earth I really believe there will be a wide-spread social upheaval in which many people will turn to religion and at the same time there will be many people who turn away from religion. The fact is that no religion talks about aliens and those people who expect their faith to explain what aliens are will find nothing. Islam talks about Jinn, which are essentially spirits, and their description seems to be similar to aliens. But if a UFO lands on earth and out pops ET, i dont think any one can say that their religion predicted this or has any explanation.    The idea that our lives are pre-destined is a very troublesome one that makes me wonder what is the true purpose of religion. The idea that God already knows what we are going to do makes it seems as if we have no control over our selves and that there is no such thing as choice. If God already knows then did he already make the choice for us ? If we havent made the choice then how can He know ? Has he programmed us so well that he already knows what we will do in a given situation ? If so, then my choices have already been made for me. If in fact my choices have already been made for me then why should I be held responsible for the bad things that i do ? Or why should i gain benefit from the good things i do ? Now if we do have choice then is God relevant ? I believe so. In my opinion there is a Grand Creator of this universe and the creator is God. And as such he deserves our credit and gratitude for having given us life and created this world for us.  I know its a simple answer to a complex question that in know way solves this problem....and to be honest I really had to stop and think about whether or not God is relevant in this situation. Im still not sure.  I really do find this idea of good/bad deeds to be rather primitive. Its just so greedy, thats the best way i can put it. People are driven to do good deeds because they think that it will get them access to heaven ? That just makes the good action useless in my eyes. Im not going to help an old woman cross the street because I think im helping the "Send Atif to Heaven Fund" im helping her because she needs a little help getting across the street. And in my religion in particular there is this thought that a believer must out weigh his/her sins in order to reach heaven. So if you do a certain action and say this verse a certain number of times your "reward" is multiplied by X. Who is keeping track of all this ? Is there someone out there keeping count of all their sins and all their "reward" ? Some kinda Soul Accountant who is gonna show God all the great stuff you did so now you get to go to heaven....Im not talkin about the angels on your right and left shoulder, im talking about a person, an individual, who is going to keep track during their lives ? So when they die they can look at their "Soul Account" and see where they expect to be going ........What if once we die God shows up and says "I just made all that stuff up, its meaningless.." What IF that happens ?  In my more cynical moments id say that religion is nothing more than control. It was designed to control people with the fear of something greater than man, greater than Earth. Something so powerful, so frightening that everyone would do as they are told in order to avoid the eternal punishment. The Day of Judgement is just a way to make us feel guilty for the bad things we've done that no one knows about. Judgement is just a way to control humanity. I have my doubts as to what the afterlife holds for us if anything at all. I wonder if there will really be a judgement or if when we die there will be nothing but silence; nothing but darkness. I ask again, why would God create us and give us life, free will, and intelligence, only to test and judge us ? Karl Marx was right when he said "Religion is the opium of the masses." Religion serves to give us explanations for things that we cannot explain. The fact remains that all the religious books and texts that document the history of different religions were written by man. There is no original text of God's message therefore I am extremely skeptical as to the validity of any book(s). I want to see a 1000 year old version of the Quran. I want to see the orginal version of the Bible, not the King James version.  I want to see the Arc of the Covenant be discovered and when two stone tablets with the Ten Commandments come out of it then maybe I'll change my thinking.  Everyone will agree that being a good person is a very important thing for a human being. However, I am still stuck inside the trivial customs and rituals of my religion. For example, my religion says im not supposed to eat any meat from a pig. Now I have no idea how eating a pig affects me being a good person but I have been brainwashed so well that I still cant eat anything with pig in it. No sausage, ham, pork chops...nothing...I just cant do it. I do find these little things that i worry about trivial in the grand scheme of things.  If indeed the purpose of religion is to teach us how to live as good people then why does every religion have so many of these little rules and regulations ? I cant get a tatoo, wear gold, or eat pork. Now how does any of that affect whether or not I am a good person ?   I do not find anything wrong with practicing any religion. Any person practicing any religion for the purpose of trying to live as a good person; that person is a believer. I still think we are all headed to the same point from different paths. It is the exclusivist way of thinking, the I AM RIGHT and everyone else isnt, that I am vehemently opposed to. Heaven or hell, no one KNOWS if these places exist. So why are so many living for the next life ? All Im saying is that everyone KNOWS their life here is short. Everyone KNOWS hate breeds hate. So spend your short time here spreading peace and love instead of hate because you will only be remembered by what you brought into the world.  Im not living on this earth so that i can reach some higher plain of existence in a next life at the expense of my life here on earth....I am trying to live as a good person in this world b/c i think it will bring me happiness during my life here...and that is the most important part of "religion" ....... living well. And its alot harder than these words make it seem.
