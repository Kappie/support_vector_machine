I will never make a real difference to anyone in this world. People probably wouldnt even know if I just dissappeared. I dont like this place but i stay here because my life is not my own. I sit and wait for the day that this pointless excistance of mine ends. I wonder what would my friends and family would be like if i had never excisted. To be truthfull they would probably be exactly the same as they are now. I have never realy done anything that would change a persons life and to tell the truth i dont think that I ever will. I am waiting hoping that maybe God will show me what ever purpose he must of had in creating me. Now that i think of it though who, said he had a purpose in creating me. I wish i knew why I seem to hate my own existance. Oh well life is still just barly starting for me maybe by the time it does i will understand the joke that is my life.........
