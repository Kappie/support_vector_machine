Thanks to everyone for making me feel better after having a shitty start to the day. Hopefully the rest of 2004 is filled with good times like last night.  At around 7PM, a large portion of [SMUT] went to the Outback for our last meal of 2003. While waiting for the food, everyone played dice. There were some large bets and I think Nick and Bob were the only two who walked away happy. Somehow I managed to hold off without gambling most of the night despite my Win For Life addiction. The real fun started when the waitress brought out the Outback bread. K-Rod and Chris had a contest to see who could fit an entire loaf in their mouth all at once. Chris won, and then started to regurgitate the bread, which looked like he was pooping from his mouth. That's when the manager came over and yelled at us for swearing and being too rowdy. Haha, good times.  After dinner we picked up a ton of beer at Amoco and headed over to Bob's. This was probably one of the best parties that Bob ever had. Everyone was wasted off their ass and having a good time. We celebrated New Years for each of the U.S. time zones. It's funny how bad the countdowns suck for the other time zones. The real party is on the east cost, bitches. At some point during the night I got drunk enough to dance. Haha, big mistake there. Thanks to Katie for putting up with my shitty dancing. : ) After about 12 beers (I lost count very early), Adam was nice enough to give me a ride home. Thanks Adam!!!  Jeff, one of my suitemates from Albany, has invited Bob, Andrew, and myself down to his house in Nanuet for another party tonight. I've heard good things about Jeff's parties so I can't wait.  -BIGsmut.
