    
       for so long now you have captivated me.  for so long my thoughts have lingered on you.  the memories of what once was still live within me.  the memories that i relive over and over again.  the dreams of what i could have.  there are times when i wish that i could stay in those dreams...forever.  where my soul is at peace and nothing can harm me.  where i am safe...and not alone.  i have searched...and there have been others...yet my heart could never let go.  and though i have been crushed so many times...i still cannot let go.  and so now all i have left are the memories and the dreams.  haunting shadows of hope.  tormenting me with every glance...with every laugh...every smile...and every tear.  welcome to my haunting requiem.
