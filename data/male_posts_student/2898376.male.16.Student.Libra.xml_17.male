They encapsulate every good part of a film inside two, and at the most three, minutes. The film they refer to is often long, boring and dull. The film I salivate in anticipation of currently is 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow'. And why? Because of the trailer. I watch 3 times a week at skycaptain.com . It looks fantastic. The sets, the thirties-ness, the style...but I'll bet it's crap.
