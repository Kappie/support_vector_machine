That movie was trippy, but not as bad as people made it out to be. Movies like Seven and 8mm were way worse. 8mm is the only movie I can say really disturbed me when I saw it. I was disturbed by the intensity, suspense, and imagery. For the Cell, there was some crazy imagery, but the suspense and intensity wasn't there.   I'm making myself some tea right now so that I can try to get some work done.  Oh yea... why the hell are we gonna get a foot of snow tomorrow... it's fucking April!  **
