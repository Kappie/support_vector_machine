Been working out (jogging and light lifting) at least.   urlLink $191 billion  for war in Afghanistan and Iraq. That’s a fucking mind boggling amount. That’s enough to cover tuition for every one of the  urlLink 16.5 million college students  in the country for a year. Sad huh?  Things  urlLink like this  are sad. It’s one of many examples of media consolidation and the interlocking nature of corporate power. People talk about the pluralism of the hundreds of media outlets, but what good is it when Viacom, Disney, AOL Time Warner, ClearChannel, etc. own all these outlets and make deals with corporations like Nike, McDonalds, etc. Possibly the only thing that challenges the monopolism of TV and radio is the Internet. However, it doesn’t help that Microsoft is always  urlLink expanding …   These aren’t happy posts are they?  Well anyway I’ve got job training tomorrow… I get to look forward to a summer of coffee and ocean air!   ***
