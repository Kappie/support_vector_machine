You dont know the consequences of what you do, but the real question is what could have happened if you did not do it. You can lose a friend by saying something that is on your head but you could also lose that person by not saying what is on your head. Is it right to lie or bend the truth to a friend just so that you dont hurt them, is that being a friend, or should you tell them if something is really bothering you. Throughout my life i have done many stupid things, from trying to help two people involved in one situation and helping both parties and i ended up causing my self a lot of troubles, and then there is the recent trouble that i caused. I dont know what will become of what has happend but it was a decision between two different and possibly equal regrets, to tell somebody or not to tell somebody, that was a hard decision. I chose to tell somebody and i now see the consequences of doing what i did. But what could have happened if i did not tell the person, what could have happened then. Well that is what is in my head currently   TJT
