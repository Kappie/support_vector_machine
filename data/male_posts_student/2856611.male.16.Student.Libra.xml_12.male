I woke up like really early, so I decided to watch Pokemon as it was on Sky One and I couldn't find my remote. I dont mean to be rude but is it me or do the creators of Pokemon just repeat the same things over and over again, a 3 year old could plan a series of Pokemon. Example;  Episode 01:  Ash Ketchup finds a pokemon called Crap-o-mon! Whilst Team [Insert Evil Name Here] plot to steal Ash's favorioute pokemon - uhh... Gay-ma-chu! but fail to exectue the plot eventually flying into the sky using some Japanese style animation whilst shouting a phrase that relates to their team name in different vocal pitches.  Episode 02:  Ketchup ends up at a Pokemon center after crap-o-mon gets a bad case of the runs, he runs into a nurse that his friend, Dave, finds very attractive and pauses every now and then whilst the background still moves. Meanwhile Team [Insert Evil Name Here] suprise Ash with a battle, Gay-ma-chu uses his trust flower punch! Team [Insert Evil Name Here] exit using the same way they did in episode 01. Crap-o-mon runs back to Ketchup and they share a moment of breif emotion.  Episode 03:  Dave gets arrested for harrasing the nurse by the police woman who looks alot like the nurse, Dave finds her attractive... again. Ash finds the gym-leader, Kin-Jo-Fu-Ya-Crazy-Japanese-Name-Wing! Master of... uh... business Pokemon, Ketchup loses a battle cause Crap-o-mon is crap, hence the name, why did he catch that one? Ash learns a valuable lesson about how not to find his pokemon attractive!  Episode 04:  WOOOO! Ash wins the battle because Crap-o-mon evolved into... Shit-e-mook and used his... uh... flying fece's attack after Kin-Jo-Fu-Ya-Crazy-Japanese-Name-Wing's pokemon - Corperateish missed with his close breifcase attack. Ash gets his first gym badge - Business-esque name badge. Dave is released from prison and group travel to their next location - Torquay.  See, easy! took me, like 5 minutes. Anyhow, so after Pokemon finished I went on the computer and sat their wondering what to do, played some Weird Al whilst I sat their and contemplated what to do, when I noticed a Harry Potter advert on TV so I randomly decided to download the game... meh... its still going, I have a HORRIBLE feeling its going to be a virus. Then anyhow, I turn around and whats on TV - YU GI OOOOOOOOOOOOOooh maaan!... Switch OVER! Meh... Im hungry, I'll post a bit later.
