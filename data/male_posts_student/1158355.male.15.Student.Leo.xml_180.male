Nothing special in school today, just a normal happy day. You know if you take The Dark Side of The Moon album (Pink Floyd) and match it up with Wizard of Oz, playing them simultaeneously, the cd goes to the movie. So I hear. Pretty cool. However,  urlLink this  is what pissed me off when I got home. WARNING: IF YOU CANNOT HANDLE AN ALIVE GUY GETTING HIS HEAD CHOPPED OFF, DO NOT CLICK ON THAT. It was some unknown russian soldier. I guessed it was Russian/Afghani war where the Afghani's completely obliterated the Russians. Then violently murdered the POWs. Or maybe it's a bunch of fucking crazy ass cannibals as Paul believes. Well I got so mad I screamed just about every curse that exists. Then I hit my Arizona can and it hit the shelf, bounced off and hit the wall and was eradicated biotch. Then I kept trying to fit something horrible in my profile that would shock everyone that read it because I was so pissed off. Man, if I ever got one of those guys information, I would hunt them down, first kill their friends, then family, then them. Or maybe that Russian deserved it, nah I doubt it. Russians kick ass. Yea Christian! Anyways, I went to Jared's for his "birthday party" and I had an awesome time. Laughed alot. Danced in strobe lights and did this popping out face at someone that Paul thought was top 3 or so funniest things he's ever seen. I did it to Dan and Pat and Jimmy and Eric and them all last year in the pool. I'm play dead or something and then I open my eyes and scream and throw my head towards them. Eerie but hilarious. This time I was first impersonating The House of Haunted Hill dude when he spazzes out. What am I talking about? Oh right, the party was fun. It was Paul, Matt, Jay, obviously Jared, Erin, Kayla and Rebecca. We ended up playing  SPIN THE BOTTLE  but I don't wanna get into details except at the end I ended up with only boxers on. Then Jared flagged me, it must have been a horrible site for the guys, the girls didn't see. Then on the ride home some dude kept tailgating my dad so he kept stopping short and he kept telling Paul retarded stories of retarded me and Paul would do that UHHUUAAAAA UHHUAYAAAA UHYAAAA UUUHAAA laugh. With the U and Y. Weird distinct Paul Stoltz laugh. Wow, it's 1:17, I haven't stayed up this late in...a long time. Maybe I should try sleeping. Dat'll do donkeh, Dat'll do. Yea shut up kid.
