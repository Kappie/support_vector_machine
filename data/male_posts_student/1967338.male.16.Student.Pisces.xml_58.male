What gets me is her reaction.  I was putting it off because of my fear that she'd be angry or sad, but what she did was much worse.  She smiled, said ok, and was completely unbothered by it.  In fact she almost seemed relieved.  It doesn't do much for my ego, and it confirms my belief that the whole relationship was meaningless.  What a waste of a chunk of my life.  Well, at least people like Kiel can't say I've never had a girlfriend (or for that matter never been to State).  I hope we beat LC just so I can rub it in his face.  That would be rich.  No time for Mtto5 today, too close to last time.  Consider the first line of my post my message to everyone. To Thomas's I add: I was kinda kidding, but whatever. Btw, this doesn't mean Claire won't be there on Thursday.  We "broke up amicably."
