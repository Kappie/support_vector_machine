I don't really want to explain what happened in the past few days because it's not like you care. I mean come on, I don't expect you to, maybe if I was a celebrity you'd care but I'm a normal teenager like everyone else. This thing just tells people boring stuff about others and I'm not going to write in this anymore unless you IM me saying "Write more, we all read your journal." I know one person that reads it, Paul... and that's it. Hey, funny thing is I can reveal my true secrets and nobody will know because NOBODY READS THIS!!! One more Science Regents and summer officially starts and school is officially over until September. YES! LADIES! BEACHES! ANGELINA JOLIE!!!! Oh wait... I forgot who I was, well I'll dream about GIRLS AND BEACHES but dreams are dreams and and these dreams seperate me from the real girls... poor Thomas. Hey, maybe I'll have some chance with a hot girl when I'm older... I'm talking 67.  Tom's Secret of The Day - Tom has only 1 1/2 friends. Chris Michaelis and his half cousin.
