Saw   urlLink The Manchurian Candidate   last night, and although I was wary going into it due to the  urlLink Rich article  from an earlier post, I was thoroughly entertained.  I have seen the original  urlLink Frankenheimer classic , but don't remember much about it.  That doesn't mean I didn't like it though, and I think my foggy memories helped me to enjoy the remake more than if I had been closely comparing the two.  There are similarities, but the new film updates the setting to a modern-day, absurdly Orwellian terror-saturated America.  Rich was mostly correct in his evaluation, but the movie is not as overtly politically opinionated as I thought it would be.  However, it is clear that the  urlLink director  wanted to paint the current geo-political landscape as one fraught with fear and doomsday-ish machinations.  In what Rich sees as a deft ploy to trick the right,  urlLink Meryl Streep's  conniving character (flawlessly portrayed) is actually a Democrat (implied), who conspires to use her son to control the presidency.  Although the movie subtly injects a steady dose of leftist ideology (a failing war on terror and a corporate conspiratorial putsch), this did not deflate my enjoyment of a well-executed, intensely slick storyline.  Artistically admirable and solidly acted,  Candidate  held my attention completely, resulting in quite an entertaining trip.  Alarmist politics aside, this one is worth your time if for nothing other than the cerebral calisthenics. 7/10
