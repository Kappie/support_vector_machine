Blue Episodes on a DVD so I could store them, but the stupid recorder keeps screwing up five minutes in, ruining a total of five DVD-R's.  -  Band trip went wrong in so many different ways.  1. I forgot my mouthpiece. 2. I forgot to pack snacks. 3. I was crammed next to Kyle and Taco for the first half of the trip. (Also on top of heater!) 4. Quiznos sucked in that location. 5. I was thirsty. 6. We lost through a series of bad calls. 7. It took us WAY to long to find the bus. 8. Still hot on the bus. 9. Lost my voice from singing and yelling. 10. Very thirsty. 11. No vending machines at the goddamn rest stop. 12. Couldn't sleep. 13. Couldn't sleep in car on way home. 14. Couldn't sleep when I got home. 15. Oh so thirsty!  Well, the trip from hell is over with now, good.  -  In other news, I'm having second thoughts about the dinner idea....  Note: Old School really wasn't that bad.
