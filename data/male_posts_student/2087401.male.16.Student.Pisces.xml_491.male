Erin, if you read this in time, please bring the tapes to youth group so they can listen to a bit of the madness. The new template fits my current mood perfectly.  This research paper is driving me mad! I'm about half-way done with it, but I have a real headache, and have taken two naps because of it.  It's like pulling teeth out of my ears.  I am generally Goshenellumpth.  Oh well. Back to work.  It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.
