They'll be awsome on the airplane rides :). I'm happy. And I got a new cd player a couple of days ago and it plays MP3-CD's. I can listen to 143 songs on one cd. I'm happy. I wen't to bed at 6:30AM last night(well, technically this morning), so I woke up at 1:30. I love it.  I'm happy. Well I can't wait, and it turns out that I'll be staying Friday at my sister's, who is married and has her own house in tampa. I'll be spending the night and she'll take me to the airport in the morning (saturday) Then I'll be on a 2 hour flight to D.C to stay 2 days and then leave to Canada for a connecting flight to London. D.C-Canada-London-France-Rome-Milan-London-DC-Home. thats alot. Then I spend the last 2 weeks of July in Indiana with my dad :(. I don't like him. He's loserish (is that a word?). That meen's I'll be spending my 15th birthday in Indiana...probably working..sealing parking lots(recovering parking lots with new asphault) It gets up to 120 degrees on there in summer and it smells REALLY BAD. Plus if you get it on you or on ur clothes, their ruined. O well, life has its cycles and mine is going to go through Suck-Mode. Least I'll have memories of Europe in Indiana.   PS: I'll have enought frequent flyer miles to escape to Japan. AND THEN FINLAND!!! YAW!!! lol.
