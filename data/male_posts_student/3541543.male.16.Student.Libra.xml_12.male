Two weeks in NC, a week in Maryland to visit my aunt and her roomie, and two weeks with my stepmom in Arizona. Also a couple of days in Arkansas because my grandparents want to visit some stepmom family and stuff. Well being gone for five weeks is pretty harsh, no friends I'm just stuck with my brothers for 5 weeks haha. Dang this is going to suck. But yeah I have to do a lot of training and working out stuff for soccer if I plan to make Varsity this year. But I don't know because Jv is pretty fun. I like the no pressure no one gives a sh** attitude on Jv. Being the person blamed for losing the game is not my thing, especially since I'm always put on f**king defense. Yea lots of pressure their, and all that stress just makes me breakout and then that doubles the stress factor along with my crappy playing.   Summertime I get lazy and drink soda and just sit on my a** all day and watch boring tv shows. Not this summer darn it, I'm going to make something of myself. I'm going to get some abs, I'm going to be proud to wear my speedo. haha just kidding I don't wear speedos so so sorry to disappoint. Anyways, this summer will be a good summer. I have lots of things planned when I get back. I'm going to SPEC camp with Ashleigh and I can't wait. oh sh** I still need to sign up:| crap crap crap. I got to get on that right away in a sec. I also got soccer camps and I got a rafting trip down there in Noel Missouri. I can't make it to the incubus concert in KC because of the SPEC camp. I'm sorry Sprint, I know you think I'm totally freaking whipped and well maybe I am. I don't think I'll learn my lesson. Especially since I don't want to haha. alright well I got a problem I'm about to post up so see ya later.
