WHY WHY WHY???!??!!!  no matter... i will survive this. i have cheated the cosmic order before; once more should not be difficult. watch out people! practice grovelling now while it's still legal! fear me and remember-- EVIL THY NAME IS JAYKIE!!!!! AHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!!!  completely wrong thought of the day:  a: dude, my close-up "icylicious blue" is like icy and blue and all so it's like... cool...  b: dude, my close-up "lemon mint" is like, it has lemons and stuff and it's all...  a: lemony? b: no dude! it's like it has lemons and mint and stuff so it's like... sweet... me: dude my close-up "these writers are no talent hacks" is like, so five years ago, and like, it's a total rip-off of dude where's my car which was kinda funny but is like sooo old and sooo not rip-off worthy and like i could've thought of a better ad in my sleep and like you two are like so totally annoying and like i wanna rip out your vocal chords but like the writers are all like... retarded...
