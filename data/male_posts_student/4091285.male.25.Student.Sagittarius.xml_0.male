If, Stephen Hawking, Michio Kaku and others read Douglas Adams'  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,  they would be able to save a lot of energy, money and time. There is no need to keep trying to come up with a Theory of Everything. The answer is right there: forty-two.  Oddly enough, what stands as a joke, can actually pass for an answer of sorts. In that funny little novel it takes several million years for a computer to solve the most important and basic doubt in all our minds: what does it all mean? The Great Question. Its answer is, of course, impossible to comprehend. Forty-two? Just as for today's scientists it is almost impossible to envision a realistic way of testing their most modern theories regarding the origin of the universe.  Just as well, because when and if they do, we will still have to deal with the great question. And just as before--since the beginning of philosophical enquiry--people will disagree as to what it all means. There is simply no way around it, because at a particular level, things start meaning what people want them to mean. Thus, different schools of thought will interpret results in such a way that they support whatever suits their fancy.  In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the computer suggests why its answer is so baffling: no one knows how to phrase the question. The same is true for all philosophical endeavors, it depends on the question for the answer to make sense. Therefore, there will never be an end to the conflict between science and religion, or philosophy, or any such debate. Cultural, political, religious, or other reasons, will make it almost impossible to end the traditional impasse.  That is why Adams' can very well be the most accurate answer. After all, it is irrelevant. What really matters is the debate that it creates and the motivation it provides to further scientific and philosophical enquiry.  As for me, I know just two things: it is fun to be human and it is fun to know that there is already a possible answer to the question that deprives so many people of sleep and puts so many others  to  sleep.  Forty-two.
