This week, Kahnsworth appears in an 'academic' version of a disgusting bastardisation of Gilbert and Sullivan's  The Mikado . Named  Hot Mikado , its world is a suprising accurate caricature of Japan today. The main Japanese elements remain, but all else has been replaced with American features - accents, clothing, all reminiscent of 1940s America.   The nervousness would be easy to deal with if I could actually justify my involvement in the musical. I am continuously ambivalent about my part in it, consistently revising why I choose to be in it in the first place, and why I continued my involvement to the very end.  It is a school musical, so the bar is not raised very high. I want to exceed the bar, impress all, a triumph of form and meaning. I love chucking that in writings all the time, because it sounds like I know something about art.  Is my entire personality a facade? Although at times the answer would certainly be yes, no, no it isn't.  The people I have met and got to know through the musical are superb. But have I actually gotten to know any of them? Continuous superficial conversations on my part have led to my knowing I can talk shit with many people, but not many new friends. The amount of friends I have at the moment is not alarming at all; I am happy, I have several.   But, as the adage from  Full House  goes: "Friends are like jello, you can never have too much."  So it's either poor grammar or poor semantics if you are to quote  Full House  correctly. Oh dear. How American. Nevermind.   Post Script:  Eric Bana has been announced as the new James Bond by  News of the World , an exceedingly unreliable tabloid. It would be extremely interesting if it is true, but I will continue to doubt the reliability of this information until I see Bana in the next Bond film.   Why, when I write 'Bond', do I consistently make a typographical error and write 'Bong'? I'm not addicted to marijuana... yet.
