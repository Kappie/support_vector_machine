It's like television is the metaphorical equivalent to mana in an acid rainstorm - every hundredth drop is pure heaven sown into the sky by God himself; everything else will melt straight through your skull and leave you deader than the non-virgin blond in a horror flick. Joss Whedon has brought a lot of the television I currently consider worth watching to the screen - as has this "Dick Wolf" fellow. I hear that Dick has earned his name through force of personality, can't say I'd know for certain. It appears that like Mr. Whedon's other offerings, Buffy and Firefly, Angel will soon be going off the air.  That's gonna cut my TV watching down quite a bit. Right now I've got Angel, Smallville, Law and Order and it's variants, and that's about it. Reality shows are just sucking far too hard to care anymore. Let's get back to good old TV. Apparently Steven King has a new showing called "Kingdom Hospital" - I'll check that out - it's a hospital with ghosts.  I've been at the golfing range quite a bit lately - it's something fun to do with dad. I spent a little time people watching at the mall today. It was an interesting exercise.  You'd be surprised how many old men wear the same flat cap.
