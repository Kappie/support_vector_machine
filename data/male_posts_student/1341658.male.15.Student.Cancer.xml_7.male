"                  The right door was open, and everyone was perfectly still, for about five seconds that is until someone in the very back sneezed.  It was a pretty loud sneeze, considering that just a few moments before you could here a pin drop.  This sneeze definitely made a louder noise than a pin dropping.  In fact, this noise was so loud compared to the previous few seconds that several people turned to look at the man who sneezed.  One of these persons was the King, and in turning around he noticed that his own daughter was not next to him anymore.  Confused and worried, he stood up to pronounce his daughter missing, but nobody heard him because at that moment a beautiful woman exited the right door in a semibarbaric manner.  It was a lady known very well by the King.  She was arguably the apple of his eye. That woman was the princess.  But how did she get to the right door so fast?  	Well, the moment she made a quick gesture to her right, she became very worried.  What if the young man saw her right as his left and went to the left door instead.  All eyes on the doors, she quickly crept away from her seat.  	“I just can’t watch the result,” she said to the guard as she left the arena seating.  	And in saying this, she meant two things:  First, she would not watch him get eaten by a tiger.  Second, she would not watch him marry the lady.  She ran as fast as she could toward the little hut that held the tiger and the lady, where she had been just a few hours before.  As it turns out, the king’s workers accidentally put both the tiger and the lady in the left door area which explains why no one came out of the right door and also explains why the princess was able to walk out the right door.  	The King was astounded, but he knew his system never lied so he had his daughter marry the young man immediately.  And they all lived happily ever after, even the man who sneezed because his wife handed him a handkerchief.  As for the lady and the tiger, one was able to escape the hut.  One was forgotten.  And so I leave it with all of you: Which came out of the side door, -- the lady, or the tiger?
