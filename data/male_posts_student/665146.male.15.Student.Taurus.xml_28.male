Through extensive research, I have come to information that may help millions of elderly people worldwide and will forever change the way we look at life and death:  When old people are talking about taking a shit, they will call it a "Bowel Movement" or "BM"; but if they are pissed off or trying to describe something annoying, they will openly say, "Shit!"  Unusual???   Thank you.
