A litter of Coke in the U.S. costs about PHP 110 ($2 US) while here in Barangay Maruglo it's PHP 19 ($0.035 US).  Almost finished the  Da Vinci Code . That's a really good book! If all the facts in the book are correct, it has some very important implications on religious belief and thought.    Okay, so I'll write up some haikus tomorrow when I get to the NGO.    Houses here for a 4-bedroom 2 bath house in Angeles City in a nice barangay or sub-division is about PHP 3 million (~ $60,000 US). Time to start saving up and getting that dual citizenship!
