If anyone has been offended or confused by anthing I say, especially if it seems like i'm contradicting myself, just drop me a line or give me a call or talk to me in person. I hate it when people are confused about me.  That said, I can move on to this night's entry. I just got back from Amanda's house. It was nice, just Clay, Nikki, Ash, Manda and I all sitting around a fire, chattin it up about various things. I've been having some really good conversations lately. It makes me happy. Crystal always used to hate that I could never speak my mind if I wasn't writing. I think I'm starting to fix that shortcoming. Well, yay me!  I took a nap this afternoon. Or evening. It was nice, I haven't had a nap for a long time. It reminded me of a day a while ago that Crystal and I were just laying on her couch, watching Oprah, and she fell asleep there in the middle of the afternoon. I felt happy after I woke up. Tonight, I'm going to turn off the computer before I go to bed, and I'm going to set the sleep timer on the TV and turn the light off. It should be a good sleep. I haven't had a good sleep for a while now. Last night was the worst sleep I've had in weeks. Damn couches and other people. I hate the feeling of being so incredibly uncomfortable, but at the same time don't want to move because you don't want to disturb someone else. Worst feeling in the world.    it makes me sad to read these words, because I've tried so hard and they've done nothing   Good night.
