If I was in the next room, I would tell him to turn it down at the very least. He's too old now and so am I. (Though they still check my ID at in Canada, what's up with that?) People that old (as old as him, that is) CAN learn to tricks, but they don't WANT to. So forget it. My dad comes home at night, watches TV for a few hours, and goes to sleep. That's it for him, maybe for the rest of his days. The only thing I can really do is resist that kind of entropy for the next 60 or so years. Wish me luck, dude. I've already been online for an hour now.
