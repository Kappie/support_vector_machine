I also want my life to be less confusing....confused???  I will explain. Tina sent me an email that said she didn't hate me, and in fact was kinda sad that I hated her..when I really don't....and she was convinced that I was trying to get Jackieto hate her in Japan..when I wasn't doing that either.  Me and Jackie were simply reminiscing....not very NICE memories...but memories none-the-less.  I have been emailing Keli for a while now, and boy do I miss her.  I just wish she would come back...then life would be less of a hell.....I spent most of today arguing with myself over Tina or Keli...which is dumb...because Tina doesn't like me and I know it...well, she doesn't like me in THAT way anymore....if she ever did, which Japan made me doubt.  Either way, as soon as Keli gets back from Japan...after giving her the biggest hug ever, I'm gonna ask her out..and I will be happy....UBER happy...the happiest I've been since January 5th...or so.  God do I look forward to that day...now i must go home and work on Japanese homework...stupid japanese teached hating me....*grumble**grumble**grumble*  and I need a shower...after working at McD's and burning my hands and such...... Peace, Love, Valvoline  Spense
