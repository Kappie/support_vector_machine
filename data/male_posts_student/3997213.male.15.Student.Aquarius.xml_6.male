We weren't going anywhere, the house was pretty quiet, and it was raining.Sounds great but wait, this is reality.In reality, things don't always work out the way they were meant to be. You guessed it. I did squat on my report. Yes procrastinator was written all over my face today but I obviously never looked in the mirror considering I went the whole day seemingly oblivous to my homework. Oh well. I'll get it done. So, as I was saying, it rained all day if you didn't the count the hour or so in between. Iwoke upto mom talking on the phone. I always said she's a loud talker on the phone but itjust seems so much louder in the morning. Reid slept in later than normal and Rachel and her friend were in the play room. Mom made some awesome french toast. The morning dragged on. I lounged around in pajama pants until mom announced the possibility of us going out to lunch with Aunt Debbie. This was the hectic part of the day. See, you have to understand that Reid is very picky with his chicken. He orders chicken at basically every restaurant and I assume that after ordering the meal at least 25-50 times, you start to get very "weird" about the chicken you eat. He likes Friendlies. We were just at Friendlies and weren't about to go again today. Uh here is where we had our problem. Reid was grumpy and tired. He wanted Friendlies and nothing else. Personally, I didn't care where the heck we ate but, eventually (against what Reid wanted)the choices were narrowed down to Stewarts Root Beer and Wendys. To make a long story short, we went to Stewarts but with a lot of hassle getting out the door. Riley was fussy and needed a nap so she made everything complicated and stressful with her crying. That was the last thing mom needed. We picked up Aunt Debbie and went out in the pouring rain. Very pouring rain! Stewarts was good. I had the best California Chesseburger EVER. Riley slept in her seat.  We came home and jumped in the pool in the rain. Wow that is fun. Reid had soccer camp and I was staying here with Rachel. Her friend had gone home. Mom and Dad went to watch Reid. The 2 hours or so we were here was very boring. I watched TV. Period. TV gets very boring after a while especially when it's near 8:30 at night, you're home alone, and have yet to eat dinner. We had pizza from East Ridge at 9:15 and it was anything but peaceful. It was a typical family dinner where everyone is rammy from being indoors all day. You can imagine.
