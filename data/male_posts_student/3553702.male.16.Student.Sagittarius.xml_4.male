We're just four (used to be five) teenage dudes with nothing better to do than attempt to put our mediocre musical skills together to makes something that will *hopefully* sound like music. We practiced for a long time, and we finally came up with a tune. First, I'd like to clarify a few things. Warlock came up with a tune. With no words. Because we don't have a vocalist. That's another reason I refer to us as a "band". We don't have a vocalist. And its not that we INTEND to not have a vocalist, we just can't find anyone who can and is willing to sing for an amature metal band. An impossible idea, I know...why would someone NOT want that opportunity?!?!  So, here's the lineup:  Warlock: On lead guitar with his SWEET amp and pedal for great distortions, playing his B.C. Rich New Jersey Warlock.  Me: On back-up guitar on my sweet amp (maybe a better amp than Warlock, but no pedal) and my B.C. Rich Bronze Mockingbird   (For those who don't know: New Jersey means that the guitar is higher quality. Bronze means that some Korean kid made it in a sweatshop for 4 cents an hour. Thanks kid!)  Red Rage: Lead (only) bassist, on his PRE-AMP (A.K.A, baby amp) and his Squire whatever. I don't know basses quite as well as guitars, especially the cheaper stuff. RR, like me, is just starting and wasn't looking to blow a ton of cash. We used to have another bassist, thus named Old Bassist but he had to move. Good guy.  Drummer: Obviously, on the drums...if he OWNED SOME!!! This is where the band hits a snag: we use to practice in the church youth sanctuary, but we experienced some...technical difficulties. I'll tell that hilarious yet scary story in a moment. Either way, because of what happened, we cannot practice at the church anymore and therefore we can't use their drumset...the pain...  OK, now on to the most memorable story about the band that I have.  We're practicing the ONE song we had at the time (we now have one and a half) at the church and Warlock's headstock (the end you tune) kept hitting the mic stand when he would turn. I may not have mentioned it, but Warlock considers his guitar to be...well, more important than HIM. So, of course, he reaches up, grabs the mike stand (by the mike) and proceeds to try and move it. And he freezes.  What we didn't know at this time was that there is a short in that room...feeding through that mike. So, Warlock (because he's holding the STEEL STRINGS OF A GUITAR) is basically creating a circuit straight to the ground. The only person that knew what was happening was a person I will refer to as Philly Steak from now on. Philly Steak is our youth's worship dude and a very cool guy, but he kind of took the little joke of letting Warlock shock himself a little far...unintentionally.  Here's a transcript of what happened:  Warlock doesn't move for a few seconds, seems to be shaking. Philly Steak: Hey, dude! Let go of the mike! Warlock, through tightly clamped teeth: I...can't!!! Everyone: What? Philly Steak pulls a Matrix quality move, kicking the mike stand from Warlock's hands....to only knock the stand and not the microphone itself. Red Rage: Oh, crud! Old Bassist: Holy crap! Then, Philly Steak runs over and rips the cord out of the floor, stopping the flow of electricity. Warlock: OW!!!  So, anyway, that's why the story is both hilarious and scary at the same time. I was so stunned by everything going on that you'd have thought I was being electrocuted as well...except I wasn't! Warlock now has a scar from the metal of the microphone on his hand...but thats a good story for him to tell the girls, so he doesn't mind.
