Sure, my dad married and divorced again, but both mom and dad live life in a holding pattern, spurring large chances and settling for excitement in more of a "merge without checking the blind spot, but the signal is on...who would even think to merge without the signal on?" fashion.  I've felt this way for years; every time I visit one, the other parent is mentioned frequently by the parent I am with, and I sit and listen to bitching about alcohol or money or sex.  But walking into my dad's condo is an enterance into a life that doesn't move forward, yet isn't stuck in the past...just kind of a life that is there.    In 2000, my dad's door knob on the front door broke; he took it out and bought a replacement knob.  Today, the knob sits on a stack of 1970s Life Magazines in the entryway (first moved to entryway = August 2002).  "I need to get that done," he says.     In 1999, my stepmom left my dad.  This created many areas of space in the condo, most notably the garage.  My dad collects historical artifacts; he planned to make a faux office to put these in...his current office is already full of brickabrack and kitsch.  Today, the new collectables sit in a pile in the garage.  In 2001, my dad's guest toilet went on the fizz, requiring a new stopper.  I bought it with him.  Today, the stopper sits in a bag in his office.  Anytime I want to use the crapper, I have to fill the back of the toilet up with 15 jugs of water just to get a weak flush.  Floaters are always precarious; the weak drain always presents a possibility of remnants, nothing anyone wants in the morning.   Since I'm so open about my shits here, I feel no embarassment in saying that shits at my dad's house smell different than anywhere else.  I make this realization every time I visit out here; that first BM comes, and within seconds I'm sniffing around, wondering where the mix of ammonia and old death is coming from.  And I always realize it's me.  Can it be, and that bathroom just holds smell like no other?  I want to believe that there is something else wrong with the toilet, and everything that enters is filled with putrid putridness.  On the flight this morning, I looked through the window at the vast farmland outside of Phoenix; miles and miles of irrigated land, surrounded by a moat of pavement, keeping the traditional desert at bay.  If I could paint, I'd paint flyover farmland...the geometry of sustenance, soundtracked by Delta Airlines'  Easy Listening  favorites...a box maze of greens and browns and yellows.  Today, as we passed over, I saw several sectioned off plots dusted with sand, some fully covered by it.  Nature wants its moxie back.  I wonder if the makers of  urlLink The Core  know something we don't.
