I'd rather get trashed with people I actually enjoy hanging out with, not kids such as Jian(fuckhead)Carlo and others, so I'm not disappointed. Max and Meg had their daily "i-wanna-hook-up-with-you-but-dont-wanna-date-you" talks where meg ends up crying her eyes out, and ohyea she was trashed at that point so it was even worse. Oh yea and then she decides to tell Max that she's given head to her neighbor (who is COMPLETE white TRASH) twice and shes only known him a week. it's like, "WHAT THE FUCK is wrong with ya!" cmon have some respect for the ones you love. She needs to grow up and stop being a bitch like that and Max needs to learn to stay away from her for a while until things cool down. He just keeps hurting both her and himself when he sees her again and does the things he does. I suppose one day he'll learn but whatever, thats his deal. And can i just say i really fucking HATE Jian-Carlo? He's such a goddamn cocky narcisistic asshole. I'm not even gunna get into why, but we'll just leave it at the fact that,yes,he is. Okay well that ends this rant. I feel a bit better now! =P
