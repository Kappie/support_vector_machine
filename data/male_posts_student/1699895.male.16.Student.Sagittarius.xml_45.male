Saturday, the Lightning put the difficult lessons gleaned from a devastating loss in Game 6 to good use in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals. As a result, Tampa Bay emerged with a taut 2-1 victory against the more experienced Philadelphia Flyers to book its place in the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals.  There, the Lightning will face the Calgary Flames, the Western Conference champion. Game 1 is Tuesday night at the St. Pete Times Forum, which was filled with a record crowd of 22,117 rabid fans for Saturday night's do-or-die Game 7.  Unlike Game 6, when the Lightning coughed up a late lead to force Saturday's elimination game, Tampa Bay never went into the defensive shell that seems to subvert its high-octane game.  "There was a lot of anxiety and nervousness," admitted Tampa Bay's Martin St. Louis. "But, we came out hard and we kept going -- even after they scored the goal. I believe that things happen for a reason and I truly felt we needed to play a Game 7 as a team to see how we responded."  The Lightning responded brilliantly.  Flyers-killer Ruslan Fedotenko, ironically a former Flyers, and Fredrik Modin scored goals to open the lead and then Nikolai Khabibulin held the fort, even after Philadelphia's Kim Johnsson scored midway through the second period to make it 2-1.   Khabibulin finished with 22 saves, including third-period stunners against John LeClair, Alexei Zhamnov and Michal Handzus, to make sure Modin's goal stood as the game-winning tally.  At the other end of the ice, Robert Esche was brilliant, making 30 saves to keep the Lightning from building on its early lead.  While it was Tampa Bay's first-ever Game 7, Philadelphia was appearing in its 12th Game 7. The Flyers had gone 6-5 before Saturday night, although they had won just one of three on the road.  As a result, many believed that Philadelphia -- with a roster full of veteran stars -- would have the advantage in this game. Not only because of its experience, but because of the dramatic way it won Game 6. In that game, the Lightning were just 109 seconds from winning the series as they nursed a 4-3 lead established late in the second period. But Philadelphia solved Tampa Bay's cautious prevent defense as Keith Primeau scored the tying goal with an unbelievable individual effort. Then, with just 1:42 remaining in the first OT, Simon Gagne banked a pass from Jeremy Roenick off Khabibulin into the net to force Game 7.  taken from  urlLink NHL.Com
