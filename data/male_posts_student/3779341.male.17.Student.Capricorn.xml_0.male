I think that my english teacher should quit teaching, because he sucks at it.     After this, Steph, Dave, Tim and I went downtown to do some shopping and then go for lunch at this all you can eat sushi place.    On the way down, we find out that Dave can't drive, because when making a turn he takes out a chunk of the median.  He scared the living shit out of us.  We park in this Tim Horton's parking lot, and walk across to this "Metro" place.  Its closed, but it looks like some fag shop.  Then Steph mentions that the owner's gay so me and Tim can't make any derogatory comments.  The place ends up being closed, so we head on to Jackson Square. Has that mall ever gone down the shitter.  While we're at the cinema, we loose Steph and start panicking.  Appearently she was in the back room of the shoe store with the owner. (wink, wink).  But we found her and then went to the second cup to get iced hot chocolates.    We then go to some pot shop where they sell bongs and shit.  It was hilarious, there was this guy in a business suit who's at the coutner, and then goes and sits down with an issue of "high times".  Steph was trying to find something to hide her cannibus in.   We then went to some thrift shop with clothes from 1960.  Me and Tim couldn't stand the place so we wait outside the store making comments about the low-lifes that are walking by, until Tim starts to recongize them and says that we need to get out of there.    Now the best part, the restaurant.  Its all you can eat, and its sushi.  Dave really didn't have full control of the chopsticks, so it was comical how he was eating.  I ate way too much.  And was feeling sick for a few hours.  The food was soooo good.  After the sushi, we went back to the metro store, they had this sic lunchbox with the last supper on it and all sorts of shit that was cool.  Steph bought a pair of jeans.    We then went to Dave and Tim's old school to meet the teacher that made them what they are today.  If only there were more teachers like that.  Its a good thing he didn't recognize me, as I've screwed him over in the past during basketball games.  Then we dropped Tim off at home, and then i left, and I believe that Dave and Steph went to see terminal.    That's it, there's nothing else to say, except that Canadians are idiots for electing Paul Martin as prime minister.  I forgot a key event that happened during this eventful day.  A full recap of it is available on my friend Tim's blog site, the fucker uses Xanga, when Blogger is much better.   http://www.xanga.com/tlo182
