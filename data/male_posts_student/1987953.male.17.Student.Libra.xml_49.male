That is as pimp as I'm getting, sorry Face. I just have one question: Why can't I turn back time and do it right? I wish I could have made Brittany happy, but she is happier without me... finally laughing and stuff. I can't be selfish. At least one of us is happy.  Here are the lyrics to the song that has been helping me all day, DC Talk's  My Will :   I'm setting the stage for the things I love  And I'm now the man I once couldn't be  Nothing on earth could now ever move me  I now have the will and the strength a man needs   It's my will, and I'm not moving  Cause if it's Your will, then nothing can shake me It's my will, to bow and praise You I now have the will to praise my God   Complexity haunts me for I am two men Entrenched in a battle that I'll never win My discipline fails me, my knowledge it fools me But You are my shelter, all the strength that I need  It's my will, and I'm not moving  Cause if it's Your will, then nothing can shake me It's my will, to bow and praise You I now have the will to praise my God   I'm learning to give up the rights to myself The bits and the pieces I've gathered as wealth  Could never compare to the joy that You bring me  The peace that You show me is the strength that I need   It's my will, and I'm not moving  Cause if it's Your will, then nothing can shake me It's my will, to bow and praise You I now have the will to praise my God   We've got to be children of peace  Don't you know we've got to be children of peace   Anyway, I have to go to work. Pray for me! Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >
