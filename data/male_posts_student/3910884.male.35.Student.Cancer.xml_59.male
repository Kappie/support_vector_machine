I would have thought I'd find it hella cold here but with all the air-con going on in the Philippines, it all seems the same. :P  Anyways, it was nice to see my co-workers. They were all asking me about my trip and I think I told the story to each person separately. :( My voice is hoarse so I wish they would have asked me all at once in the same room.  So, I talked with the gf last night. And we both agreed a relationship is about committment and self-sacrifice. I told her I would travel to Georgia if she got accepted there and she agreed she would go to the Philippines if I got accepted to a doctoral program in public health. I really hate Georgia, so I hope she knows how much I'm sacrificing here. As fo her going to the Philippines, would she really stay with me if she knew I'd be there for maybe 5 years studying?  Uggh. Long distance relationships really suck... Been there done that didn't like it... Now I'm back in one. Boohoo!  Anyways, uploading pics of the trip from the digital camera. The 35mm shots won't be on Snapfish for a week or so... If you're interested, let me know...  Ok, off to play some video games and lounge (I'm sore from working out at the gym). :(
