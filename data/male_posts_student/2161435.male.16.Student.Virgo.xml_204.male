How brave am I? *cough I agree with Briony, that alcohol has to be shared Rob...it's just not good for you! well, I suppose we have other girls now that write on here beside myself. Kat could never really bothered and her lack of effort was getting me down. Really down. Anyhoo, today I revised science and let me tell you that there are 23 pairs of chormosomes in each cell, and in each gamete (sex cell) there are 23 chrosomes. Interesting huh? I also went to my local (crappy) youthclub and...well...blabbed on for rubbish for hours. Life is good, life is fine.
