I get upset because it's a waste of money and food. Then I get further annoyed at how here in Binghamton, we lack the super fresh produce of good old California.  Now playing: Johann Strauss - "Blue Danube Waltz"  I've been in a total classical mood lately, when it comes to music. Lots of Wolfgang and Ludwig van playing as I study... I've actually also been wanting to buy some cheapo classical or jazz CDs. You know the $5 ones you often find sitting in a bin at various music retail locations? It's kind of bitch downloading music online these days (especially via dialup). I need more study music.  Now playing: Giacchino Rossini - "Barber of Seville Overature"  Speaking of buying stuff... I feel like I've been spending a lot of money lately. Regular expenses, plus a bag for travel, books, and a Greyhound ticket. Also there's cool stuff coming out soon.  March 23 - The Descendents -  Cool To Be You  March 23 - Weezer -  The Blue Album: Deluxe Edition   April 6 - Bad Religion - Along the Way DVD / Epitaph reissues June 8 -  Bad Religion  -  The Empire Strikes First  Summer - Me First and the Gimmes -  Live in a Dive  November - Propagandhi - TBA Fall - Social Distortion - TBA I'll probably be buying some of this shit. I'm such a fucing consumer.  Now playing: Giuseppe Verdi - "La Traviata Prelude"  Speaking of consumerism, I need to do a write on some readings on the topic.  ***
