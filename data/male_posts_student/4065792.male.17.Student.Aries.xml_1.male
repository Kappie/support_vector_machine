(malex.blogspot.com i recommendthedamn alexander grahm bell one)anyways, i'm sure my life is too boring to actually read about so... i'll just make up a bunch of lies : yesterday, i was walking down the street and i shot some guy in the face and stole his car. then cops and the swat team chased me but i pulled out a chain saw and sliced them up real good. actually that was all the stuff i did while playing grand theft auto. man what a great game. it's too bad that you can't hold up a police station and then get a change of clothes and expect them not to recognise you. if i ever blow up a cop car i'm definatily going to bring a change of clothes and i don't mean just any clothes... i mean like a ninja outfit. if worst comes to worst i'll just blame my juvenile actions on the creators of the game. okay well, it's been almost four minutes since i stopped playing so i'm gonna gorestart the game and reign down a fierce storm of havoc on the poor computer generated souls who live there.
