Learnt some flash and found that surprisingly, even with my terrible flash skills, I am still able to finish the task set and get my ACE point. Yay!  Of course, there was the compulsory Chinese lesson, where everybody pretended to be paying attention but were in fact staring blankly into space. Whoopee. It wasn't SO bad. Geography was quite fun. The computer screwed up, so we had an oral discussion instead. WHen the question"what are the uses of volcanoes" was asked, so many ridiculous answers were given that I was rollin gin mirth(kk exaggerated). Some were"Fireworks", "population control", "murder" and "surfing".   Double maths was not as bad as originnally thought, because my answers to the worksheet discussed were mostly correct and I wa able to slack and talk to my friend. Grinz.
