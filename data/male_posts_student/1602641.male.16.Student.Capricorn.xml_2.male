Here's the rundown: Adult swim features many great shows that were taken off the-air, such as Futurama, and Family Guy.   They also have a heep of original's to offer.   My favorite, The Brak Show, is a spin-off of Space Ghost Coast2Coast, and it is hilarious.   If you value total randomness at all, you will love it.   Next, Aqua Teen Hunger Force.   They aren't really teens, and the show has nothing to do with water, but the rest is true.   It stars Frilock, Meatwad, and Master Shake, it is the ultimate in underground hip-hop humor.   Lastly, and this one may not be on anymore, is Harvey Birdman: Attourney at Law.   It features that weird super-hero dude with the falcon as a lawyer who defends cartoon characters.   Best Episode: Johnny Quest's Custody Hearing(Will he stay with doctor quest or Race Banyon; and what will become of Hajji?) Well that's my rant for the day, check 'em out at  AdultSwim.com
