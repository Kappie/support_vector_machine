I gave it a hundred percent and put a lot of work into it. My efforts were criticized and my words, misunderstood.  I was filled with so much anger and desperation to express the injustice which I had incurred, but now, something more important has happened. I know it seems childish and immature, but it's my world, and if it's true, what she says- that I am a fool, then I'll look back on this someday, and say I was a fool. But till that day comes, if it comes and I hope it never will, I'll hold on.  Zel came online and we had a misunderstanding. This one was really really bad and I was very sad although it was brief. She had told me that she had vented all her anger out on me and asked me to listen to the lyrics of a Chinese song. I was happy that she'd killed me till she couldn't kill me any longer, and I cried when I read the lyrics. I wish she'd told me then. Why I got so sad was because .. how do I put it? Her previous blastings hurt less coz I couldn't fall that far since I was so low. But when she told me that she'd stop, my hope balloon floated higher and now it's burst and fallen far to the ground. That's why I was so upset. The higher you are, the further you fall.  Anyway, she called me after. I was happy to hear her voice. It was the best part of my day. We spoke for a while. All there was, was an expression of sorrow and pleading on my part and angst on her's. I know there's something in there. In her. I have to get it back. I want to believe it so much, that I do. You know, like when you've told a lie for so long that you believe it.  I guess there's nothing much to express. It's all filling me on the inside. But then, I ask myself, what is filling me, and all I can say, is that it's the joy of hearing her voice and the self dillusional hope that somewhere in her, there's a longing too. Then again, I hope the hope is not self-dillusional. It sustains me and without it, I am hollow.  I think I took her for granted. Well, actually, I didn't but I definitely didn't squeeze and treasure the fullest extent possible. I know never to do that again. I was definitely not patient enough. There's a million and one things I would go back to change.  There is hope coz if there wasn't, she wouldn't have called me in the first place. There is hope. Hope is a funny word. It's supposed to be good, but it's like faith. Believing in something that you can't see.  This entry didn't come out as well as I wanted it to. I've waited too long to get to where I am now. Should type when I'm in foreplay of emotion and not in afterglow.  For now, I'll keep cutting myself with the broken pieces of mirror which I'm trying to piece back together.
