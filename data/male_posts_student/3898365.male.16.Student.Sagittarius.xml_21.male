If I can just stop listening to Roy Orbison and put in something happy happy, I'll be super fine.  But "Only the Lonely," is so pretty.  Kit sent me "The Promise," by When In Rome.  I looked everywhere for that song after hearing it at the end of  Napoleon Dynamite , but couldn't find it anywhere. I am in love with that song. All I see when I listen to it is Napoleon and Deb playing tetherball together. Happy thoughts.  Why do I have a strange impulse to call Napoleon something like Nappy D? That can't be normal.  David Cross likes TV on the Radio. I've wondered forever about what kind of music he's into. I knew his feelings about all the Creeds and Evanescences of the world, but I didn't know what he liked. Robin clipped me out this little section he had in the last Rolling Stone, and he says:   OK, now I'm going to get serious: TV on the Radio. I just say them at the Siren Festical (at Coney Island) and they were great. They were the triumphant conquerers of the day in what was a very strong lineup. Seriously, they are the next greatness.   I looked up that Siren Festival he talked about, and there were a lot of bands that played, but the ones I know of are TV on the Radio, Mission of Burma, Electric Six, The Fiery Furnaces (Eleanor!!!!), Constantines, and The Thermals. Every day I find more reasons to love that little bald man.  I can only dream that someday, someday, he'll tour with the Shins. It's not that farfetched of an idea, they're both a part of the SubPop family and he toured as the opening act with Ultrababyfat. It should happen. Maybe I'll e-mail somebody about that.  My brother brought back the Clerks Cartoons from Sarah's house! God damn, that made me a happy camper today. I listened to all of the episodes with the commentary. Most of it was them making fun of ABC and the people that ran it. And all the ridiculous censoring that ABC put on the show. Like turning Jay and Silent Bob into fireworks salesmen instead of drug dealers. And all the little jokes they had to cut out because ABC thought that someone would sue them, even though they didn't hold a candle to the things "South Park," has gotten away with.  But I wish they could've continued that show. They talked about this idea they had where Randal finds Kit (the car from "Knightrider") at a used car lot and buys it. Kit becomes jealous of Randal's friendship with Dante and plans to kill Dante and steal his identity (a  Single White Female  parody). So then they'd have Kit, dressed up as Dante, behind the counter of the Quik Stop, and nobody notices the difference. It's gold, man.    John and Sarah took me to see  Napoleon Dynamite  again. I was sitting next to Sarah and felt a bit uncomfortable laughing at the cow scene. She's a vegan, you see. And this time, since it's playing at local theaters now, it had the wedding scene afterwards. I won't say who gets married in case someone doesn't want the surprise ruined, but I will say that the guy that shoots the cow is the priest and there is a kick ass song sung by the groom.  The Magnetic Fields are so cool. They have this song on Volume 2 of  69 Love Songs  called "Love is Like Jazz." They have bongos and an accordian and a cadre of other instruments all playing different tunes while the non-Stephin guy sings lyrics like, " Love is like jazz. You make it up as you go along and you act as if you really know the song... but you don't."  Picture Time  Here's my new wall:     It looks kind of cool. A bit crooked, but hey, who cares? That's also what I drew last class.     We had to draw a quick, normal self portrait, then draw on some guidelines to change the angles and sizes of the eyes, nose and mouth. Then we folded it into four quarters. We spent 20 minutes drawing each quarter, and while you were drawing one, you couldn't look at any of the other quarters to see if the lines matched up or if the shading matched up. It was fun.     I like the little eye the best. That was the first part I drew. It bugs me how the guidelines for the eyes and mouth are still there, but I erased and I erased but they wouldn't go away.  This is one of my other drawings that I made. I don't like it as much.     It just looks too sad. It wasn't supposed to be that sad. Originally he was really happy, and then we had to change the drawing somehow over and over and over, and eventually the only way I could change it was to make him sad. And then class ended. But still, it's pretty good considering that at one time it was a man with an elephant's trunk and big elephant ears. You see that dark curve going from his eye down to his shoulder? That was it.     I was really proud of the nose, though.  I might as well add this. One of my most prized possessions:     Oh yeah. The book. Jealous?  And since I mentioned the Fiery Furnaces...     Hoooooohman.
