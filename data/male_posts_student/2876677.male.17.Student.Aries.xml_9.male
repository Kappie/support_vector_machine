I had gotten two lanes cuz I thought more people were coming but then they didn't show so we had twice the fun.  Then at 8 I brought it down to one lane because it was just the four of us.  We had some good times.  Meanwhile, I am trying to get ahold of J Trinkle and Miss Vasel who are not answering.  At 8, I decide they just got lost(it is Miss Vasel) and stop calling.  At 8:30, guess who shows up?  Yep.  The Lost Girls.  So all six of us crowded on one lane.  Then the stupid computer thing wouldn't stop messing up when we added them in.  On the lane next to us, these college kids had showed up and were getting a little friendly.  Especially when someone got a strike.  I wanted to give them the Yellow Pages and help em find a room cuz they were in the wrong place.  Mr. and Mrs.Gomez couldn't come...:(  She wasn't feeling to well.  Pregnancy can do that to ya.  Been there. done that. never again.  Hope ya feel better.  Thank you for having your baby "legitimately".  Alot of couples have opted out of that.  Kids get really messed up that way.  Mom M,W,F. Dad T,Th,Sat.  Sunday is a coin flip.  It can be fun.  So remember kids:"Fun" now, makes "trouble" later.  A little wait will help you appreciate.  I ALMOST RAN OVER A CAT!  Ok I was on my way home and I was on this street before my street.  I don't know the name.  Well anyways I saw this gray thing slinking across the road and decided to slow down cuz I thought it was a squirrel and last time I ran over an animal, the sound made me want to throw up.  I was really glad when I slowed down because I found out it was a cat and I don't want to kill some little kids pet.  That would be sad.
