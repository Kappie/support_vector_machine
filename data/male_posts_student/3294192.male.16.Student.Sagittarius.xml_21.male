I think this little fling with summer might actually do me some good.   If you don't look time travels so fast We'll have no time for now we got relaxed  (Hope you caught my trick nasty tenses)  The lone walk home was so much dryer The higher liars are all combusting   That's an awesome poem. I wrote it just for you, my sugar-momma.  So in actual heartsmacky related news, I've decided I'm going to make something tangible for all of you. It'll be both a book of sights and a CD of sounds. Expect it to be free and thus, poorly made. It will however make you a better person, like all heartsmackings. Below is just an example of the theme of the booklet. I reckon it'll be a self-improvement book about broken bones and hearts too.   urlLink    I might do as the  urlLink Notrock ers do,  (by the way, check out that hot new site design, it's so fancy!) , and print it on colored paper, but that's one more thing to do, so I figure it'll be plain white, and not brown in the background. I've also decided that parellel to this project, I will complete my redesign of the heartsmacky site. I really like the way the new  urlLink front page  turned out, and plan to use that theme for all site navigation, so expect lots of cool new graphic interfaces. I'm also going to be uploading some hot music too, that you'll be able to download without killing the site. Maybe it's time I switch to something besides geocities for my hearthosting needs? I should talk to Eric about what hosting those Notrockers use, I think it's  urlLink Echoecho . Hopefully it's also cheap.
