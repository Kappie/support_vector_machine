He had gray eyes. My family genes include a whole bunch of different colored eyes like gray, blue, green, and brown.  Anyway I felt a little odd meeting all these people but it was nice to know hey this my cousins. But like always there either too old or too young for me to approach them. A couple of cousins were crying. No one really knew me and if I had to introduce myself it had to be: The son of my grandfather’s daughter. Why you ask? Well people only knew you as the head of the family, example some of my cousins introduced themselves as kids of other people who are more above in the family tree which I call the heads. My grandfather and his siblings, which are about ten and they had about ten more kids. Just imagine how many kids that is. This was my mom’s father’s family. Yes complex like any other family tree. I never knew this side but I was part of it. I knew my mom’s mother side I’m always with them. I know my father’s father’s family and I even know my father’s mother’s side but never my mother’s father’s side until know. Zapata, Cepeda, Escoto, and Henriques that’s what I am. Later we went to Charro’s place. (Charro is a girl; it’s some weird nickname.) They made a lot of food but we already ate. So they drank coffee, smoked cigarettes and talked. Leytta is a family favorite. Martha’s introduced her to everybody already and beside Leytta’s pretty so it all works out. I came with a nice sense of the people that no matter what I’m a part of. I’m really happy that I met my great uncle Agusto, because he’s my only connection to my grandfather since my grandfather died two years ago and I never met him. Well I met him when I was so little that I don’t remember.  Rest In Peace Maria HenriquesMy beloved cousins whom I would of loved to meet for her charm and loving attitude. The heavens will accept you with out a doubt. Because that is where god wants you
