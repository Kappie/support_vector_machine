Go and shift the blame to us To us who have already nothing But never-ending pain and suffering We do no harm to thee, no misery Yet thou all blame us thy shortcomings Thy mistakes and thy imperfections “Dangerous, my friends”, be damned!  Shortcomings? Mistakes? Imperfections? Look into your own reflections Can you not see what we can see? Your own lives in insanity The fact would be that they cannot, For their own minds have gone to rot!  Rot, rot, rot; “…all minds have gone to rot” Hast thou not heard what thou hast said? Or dost thee fear that I might touch? Stop blaming and end this nonsense! And admit we are a godsend To tell thee nothing but the truth The truth that all find hard accepting  Truth? Nothing but a pack of lies! That is something we will not buy Impudence will get you nowhere If you keep up with your beliefs We know which is the truth from not Yours is raised in exaggerations! Lies, gotten out of all proportions!  Listen to thy talks of gibberish Do let go of thy stubbornness Thou cannot see which is imminent From each other we are different Unique is the mind that God made just As with His creations God made good  Reality is time, time is change Time will not stop; Time will not wait Bring down your pride before it’s too late Insane are we but wrong we are not We’re all the same but one we are not Choose for thy best thy morality!  Lost are the minds; Lost in confusion Are we really in contradiction… With what is pure and perfect and good? Are we to face an absolution? Of sin that is tainted and evil? Blessed are we with the songs of death As had been said,” Laugh – but smile no more.”
