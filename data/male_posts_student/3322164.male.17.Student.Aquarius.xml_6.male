CARLOS!!!!!! shut the hell up. Jesus Christ!!! HTey did this throught the whole game and when i flicked them off they got mad at me started threating me.  people suck. period. end of story.  anyway, im back at school and stressing out again but its all good because i get to see my girlfriend, which it is good to have one again.  well i gtg, but i will write back later.  later.  colin  MOOD: CALM MUSIC: "Califorina Songs"/Local H
