Here's one from  Destiny , with the acronym GWM (what does that mean?):   Oat Willie wears those boxers because I like to cover him in  urlLink Malt-O-Meal  and call him Wilfred Brimley and tell him that he is a naughty old man.  I can do the same to you, funny man.  Coffee sometime?   Ummm...excuse me...it is  urlLink Wilford Brimley  (Debs, how could you be so wrong?!), and he is the representative for  urlLink Quaker Oats , thank you very much.      urlLink I'll light the fire , while you place the flowers in the vase that you bought today...
