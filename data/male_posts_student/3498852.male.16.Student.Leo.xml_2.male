The damn memorial day parade is tomorrow...  bright and early...    oh boy.   So I'm dreading that.    Can't wait for school to be over.  No more homework... No more getting up before noon... no more um.... yes.    I ran out of things to say already. This should be an interesting blog.  So I'm sitting here eating butter noodles chattin with some people and listening to music.  Such an interesting life it is.  I'll be back later.  Currently Listening to: "Playing for Keeps" - Matchbook Romance  _TB
