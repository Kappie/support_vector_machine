Anyway, it is official, the car I am buying on my 18th birthday is a 1998 BMW Z3 Roadtser. Mint condition, jet black, convertable, 5 speed manual, black leather interior, and much more. I cant wait to be driving that around!   So I have one postive thing, ok thats cool, there are a few other things too that have been making me feel great latley, and if they are reading this im sure they know who they are. Only problem is now, I amnot sure about it anymore. Not because of her nor me, butbecause of my stupid head. So I am not sure what I am going to do; sit and wait, or feel as though I dont have a chance or what. I dont know my head is just kind of going crazy. :-/   Quote:  "We did it all for the glory of love"  Music:  New Found Glory - The Glory of Love  Mood:  Confused...
