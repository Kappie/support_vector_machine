"Earth is the cradle of Humanity, but who wants to spend there whole life in a cradle?" Yes, a very witty quote. Confidenially, i myself wouldnt mind moving to the moon, or to mars. that would be very very cool. Heck there are so many places we could go, just in our solar system, that would be wonderful. Humans spreading thourghout the solar system, in time we could go anywhere in the galaxy or the universe, there is infiniter resources out there! You wouldnt need to have one child policies or anything, because you just move overcrowed populations to anyother planet. Youd have totally different cultures as the landscape and terrain would effect the people living on it. Can you imagine movies from Europa? Or IO? or Mars ? Or the moon. From a space station orbiting Saturn? Beautiful.  Just a thought.
