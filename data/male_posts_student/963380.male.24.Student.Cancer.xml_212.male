How often does this have to fucking happen before our fine medical professionals realize that my tonsils need to be extricated and shipped to Iraq as some sort of weapon of biological mass destruction?? Christ almighty. My file is nearly four inches thick, 90% of it to do with various throat related ailments - LET IT END NOW! If this keeps up I'm going to grab a fork and do it myself. Yeah, that's right.  Doom 3 has gone gold. I remember nearly, what, 12 years ago when I pirated Doom for the first time. That, Doom 2 and Duke Nukem 3D were the most downloaded files off of any BBS. When I'd reached the holy grail of the internet - nearly 11 years ago - well, it was like a deep ocean of piracy wherein one would leap and bask upon the sands of IRC. Times have changed, they paved paradise, but there are still the lovely little Phillip K. Dick-like tanning booths/memory salons of Bit Torrent and the like. Hi speed sure is a lot higher. Needless to say Doom3 looks good. I shall be... picking it up.  Andrew's going to softmod my Xbox. I think. If I can ever get him to do it.  I've rescheduled all my meetings for today and I'm going to try to trade off my shift with someone. After all, would you like to address your managerial concerns to someone who sounds like Earnie from Seasame Street? Or Kermit the Frog - depending on my throat's disposition at the given moment. I may take up yodelling. Turning my head hurts. I hate all of you with healthy bits and pieces.
