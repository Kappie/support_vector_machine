Admire tagline of How Appealing: “Web’s first blog devoted to appellate litigation.”  8. Consider tinkering with tagline just a bit; briefly consider a change to “web’s first blog”; scratch idea when you realize someone would discover this exaggeration, which could damage your credibility and make people question your other lesser exaggerations about your blog.  9. Think some more about term “appellate litigation” in your tagline; remind yourself again as you do every day that appellate litigation is very important--in fact, it’s how new law is made. I'll know I've hit the big time when someone parodies me.  Please don't take that as an invitation.  I'm sensitive.  Incidentally, Mr. Bashman's latest installment of  urlLink 20 Questions , this time featuring Judge Bruce M. Selya of the First Circuit is pretty interesting -- Selya's very articulate and readable.  Check it out.
