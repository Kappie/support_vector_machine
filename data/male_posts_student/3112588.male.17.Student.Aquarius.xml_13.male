LoL! it was so funny...i have never cut school before, but i had to....i needed a little excitement over the weekend, and with the parentals gone, i basically can do what i want YES! MWUAHAHAH (evil laugh) hehe! so, i called janel and i was like: "hey janel..you wanna cut?" and she was like: "for sure!!" so, janel and kerri and rachel (who knows rob bruton) and my myself all hopped in her car (rachel's) and watched Little Mermaid LoL! how funny is that? the cops passed by us when we were parked next to the school, so we decided to go past the willow park golf course (by my house--go figure) and just park there and watch the movie! good times...then, after about an hour, we came back to my house, watched Blind Date and 5th Wheel, had some lunch, and kerri and janel and rachel all went back to school after the assembly was over. i just stayed home and chilled hehe! so, got some fun stuff planned for the weekend....SO EXCITED THAT SOMEONE IS STAYING WITH ME-if not, i would be so scared, it would be CRAZY!
