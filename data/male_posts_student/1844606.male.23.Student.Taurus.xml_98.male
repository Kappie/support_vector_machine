I called my landlord today to let them know as to the loud doings below, and they said "keep calling the police" and "I left a voicemail on the guy's cell phone telling him to be more considerate."  Yeah, I'm sure the message of please be kind to others will get through their skulls because having the police out over half a dozen times has really modified their behavior.  The true test comes in about an hour or so.  If I here one goddamn vibration, the police are coming and fines will be handed out.    Now I realize this might sound a bit over the top, but its something you just have to live with/through to appreciate.  Everytime I'm out watching tv later in the evening, I feel the couch vibrate from bass and then I'm chronically woken up and have trouble falling back asleep.  School and life are enough to deal with, I don't need to be tired as well.  On the brightside, I can't wait for Thanksgiving break...I'm going to try and leave here Wed. cause, lets face it, I think I can miss some classes.  My only obsticle is getting my next story done for Rhet class.  Nothing has been written but I'm thinking of doing a big farce on the judicial system with some guy being put on trial for being a romantic.  Opening scene would be overly dramatic, possibly even like Law and Order, and then they read the charge "Being a romantic in the first degree"  Character then says "damn"  I also plan on constructing a scene in which a family dog gets up on the stand, and speaks in lyrical verse and basically says that he walked in on these characters having sex and he licked their feet.  A character witness of sorts...  As for grades, they are looking better.  I'm not quite sure how this system works, but by my English Major math skills, it looks like with Extra Credit, I have something like a 101% on my last psych exam-effectively taking me out of the "C" dog house for the class. That was a reference to a grade, not some lame ass nickname...if you call me "C" dog, expect a Suge-style drive by.  I also did very well on my Sex test, missing only one question.  This weekend I have to write a paper on Why Prostitution should be legal and find "academic" sources.  There goes my interview the corner workers method.  Research for 9-11 the comic book is coming along I guess.  I went to the Comm. library the other day and checked out 15 books on comics, theory and the history of comics.  I walked up and the girl working looked at the stack with amazement.  I commented it was research.  Then she saw the titles and gave me a look.  I tried to explain, she didn't get the concept of Spiegleman's 9-11.    Professor and I are thinking about having a visual display to go along with my final thesis at the end of the year. I'm all for it.  I would love to shock and offend the hell out of the people down here.  And maybe a few will think, and question.  And I will have won.   Oh yes and I almost forgot (and most importantly)  I enjoy eating Starbursts...
