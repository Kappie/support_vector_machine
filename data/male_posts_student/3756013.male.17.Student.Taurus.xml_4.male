I haven't been swimming in a while...Hell I haven't been outside with my shirt off in a long time so I was WHITE! I got burn like you wouldn't believe. I have a hard time sitting, laying, and it burns like a bitch when I take a shower. O well, but the day was productive. I got to know someone a little better today. I've known the person a while but I got to know her a lot better. Makes me think...and its scary when I start to think lol...Anyways...today my lil friend from church got me a late birthday present. This boy is a lil longhorn boy and when he gave me the present I was surprised because it was in an A bag, had an A card, and all A stuff...it was pretty cool. Might end up getting him recruited to A by the time he gets outta elementary...hah...anyways...I'm bored...I hurt...and I'm hungry...Ill catch yawl later!
