I kinda sorta need to work on my history rough draft, oh well. I can't run the 400, and that will never change. And of course, the 200, which I actually somewhat enjoy, isn't gonna be at the meet. Kat and Jennifer (Jennifer Wong too? I'm not sure) won't be there for a good deal of the meet, Chinese school...without them, we might as well forfeit. How can we have a chance without our MVPs? :-D Erik might come and visit. Make sure to bring a very powerful shaver along. Just for him.   Richard...I'm just seeing a whole new side of him this year. He's become surprisingly friendly and helpful, and he is pretty damn athletic now. Far cry from his junior high days...except for the clothes, which are exactly the same. I mean, c'mon...he won the 400 individual medley!  Haha, the rally...totally forgettable except for Eugene, the proud tennis captain who was forced by Rudy to somersault all across the gym with a bad back and a dress with no sleeves and a shedding wig. He didn't get a girl, poor Eugene...though there were a few waving their hands wildly on the freshmen/senior side. Oh yes, they couldn't resist his wily charms. Then coming out of 4th period, we fought tooth-and-nail over who would leave class last. First, "Ladies first!" "Your mom first!" etc. Push came to shove, and we went no-holds barred. "I respect you more!" "No, I respect  you  more!" "You're older!" "No you're not, you were born a month before me..."  I had to pretend I was born in Vietnam for this girl Kim's English project. I don't think I can look myself in the mirror anymore. Ryan Tran...that...looks weird...
