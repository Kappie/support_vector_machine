She did all the artwork for my story Perfect Symphonies (which will be continued soon) So I decided to show some artwork that she does. When I scan my character artwork for my story, I'll post that too. (This is clism. A character from her story Black Ice. See the story at www.shaylart.com If you want the full sized wallpaper, contact me via e-mail) urlLink
