Several local bible scholars are insisting that the earth is flat -- because -- when "Jesus" was "tempted by Satan," Satan took Jesus up in a high tower where, according to the bible, Jesus could see "all the kingdoms of the earth."  Now, if the earth is round, how could Jesus have seen to the other side?  Therefore, the earth is flat because that's the only way he could have seen all the kingdoms of the earth."
