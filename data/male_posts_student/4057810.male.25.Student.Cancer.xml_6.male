The  urlLink JCSA , the group that organizes the language exchanges, has a rule that emails and phone numbers are not to be requested or exchanged during the time that the language exchange is in progress.  The reason for this is (supposedly) because at some point, English-speaking guys got the idea that the JCSA was some kind of repository for lonely Japanese girls.  This rule has farther reaching implications, as I discovered.  When this guy asked for my email, I gave it to him, and I would have whether he had asked within or outside of the language exchange.  But what occured to me is that there was no possible way in which I could have politely withheld my email from him had I wanted to.  How do you say "sorry, but I don't feel comfortable with you having my email" without offending someone?  Therefore the JCSA asks that you don't put anyone in that position by simply not asking within the time that the language exchange is in session.    Anyway, today I met with the guy, and actually, it wasn't that bad an experience.  For the most part, I explained the differences between affirmatives, like "sure thing", "I'm game", "why not?", and so on, as well as the meaning of a few common idioms.  I didn't mind the experience, and I didn't feel on my best game, Japanese-wise, so I didn't really feel like speaking anything but English, but all the while, I couldn't help but notice a slight shift in mannerisms from when the guy had asked for my email.  As best as I can describe it, it felt like it was the difference between someone asking for something they want, and someone who had alrady gotten what they want.  Of course, he had just come from class, so perhaps he was just tired, which would explain the somewhat less chummy vibe I was picking up.  It made me recall what one of my Japanese TAs from last year told me, about how Japanese people would just walk up to him and expect an impromptu English lesson (presumably) because he was a typical blond-haired, blue-eyed foreigner.  I couldn't help but also remember having read stories about English-speakers having been befriended by Japanese, only to discover that 友達 might better be translated as "free English-tutor" rather than "friend".  If that's that case, so long as he's willing to reciprocate and help me with my Japanese, and he recognizes that once the school year kicks off, that my studies come first, I don't much mind this arrangement.  Actually, I wouldn't mind giving the free English lessons either, if I knew that we wanted to be my friend first and foremost, however, it's probably safer to assume otherwise for now.  On an unrelated note, I noticed that recently the counter for this weblog has passed the 200 hit mark, with most of the people being...Windows XP users?  Bizarre.  Anyway, I figure since I'm not being inundated with email or comment flames, that people are at least marginally interested, so thanks for reading.
