I hate your big dumb combat boots And the way you read my mind I hate you so much it makes me sick It even makes me rhyme. I hate the way you're always right I hate it when you lie I hate it when you make me laugh Even worse when you make me cry I hate it that you're not around And the fact that you didn't call But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you Not even close, not even a little bit,  not even any at all. - Kat, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU   "When you kiss someone, everything around you becomes hazy... and the only thing in focus is you and this person... And you realize that this person is the only person you should be kissing for the rest of your life... And for one moment, you get, this amazing gift... And you wanna laugh and you wanna cry... Cuz you feel so lucky that you've found it and so scared that it'll go away all at the same time..."  ---NEVER BEEN KISSED    Is it possible to be just friends with someone i have these sort of non-moderate feelings for?... Or am I doomed forever to just be in love and ultimately significantly hurt?  ---Felicity    I created my very own first breakup rule: Destroy all pictures where he looks sexy and you look happy. Breakup rule No. 2: Until emotionally stabilized, enter no stores. Breakup rule No. 3: Never stop thinking about him, even for a moment. Because that's the moment he'll appear. And finally, the most important breakup rule: No matter who broke your heart or how long it takes to heal, you'll never get through it without your friends.  ---Carrie, SEX AND THE CITY    The only wrong thing would be to deny what your heart truly feels. ---THE MASK OF ZORRO    You will be doing anything  For the one you love...  Except love them again.  ---FAITHFUL    Lois: You know, if somebody had asked me three days ago who the one person in the world I admired most was, I'd have said you. But, without really knowing what that meant. Without understanding that the hardest thing about being you is all the things you can't do. All the cries for help that you can't answer, and how that quietly tears you apart. But it never stops you. And after living a little of that myself, I realized something...something I never thought was possible.   Clark: What?   Lois: I love you more. More than I ever have and more than I ever thought I could love anyone, and so, I wanna ask ... Will you marry me?  ---LOIS AND CLARK    I know it's a cornball thing, but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? I say fall head over heels. Find someone you love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart... Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. Because the truth is, there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived... Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike.  ---MEET JOE BLACK    Man: "Will you love me for the rest of my life?"  Woman: "I will love you for the rest of mine."  ---PHENOMENON    "The only feeling of real loss is when you love someone, more than you love yourself."  ---GOOD WILL HUNTING    When you love someone, And you love them with your heart, It never disappears when you're apart. When you love someone And you've done all you can do, You set them free. And if that love was true, When you love someone It will all come back to you  ---FORGET PARIS    "Half my days i cannot bear not to touch you, the rest of the time i feel it doesn't matter if i ever see you again. It isn't the mortality, it is how much you can bear..."  ---THE ENGLISH PATIENT    Do you believe in love? I bet you don't, you're probably too sensible for that. Have you ever seen someone and you know that if only that person really know you, they'd dump the perfect model they were with and realize that you are the one they want to grow old with? Have you ever fallen in love with someone you've never talked to? Have you ever been so alone you spent the night confusing a guy in a coma?  ---WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING    "anything less than mad, passionate, extraordinary love is a waste of your time. there are too many mediocre things in life to deal with and love shouldn't be one of them."  ---A DREAM FOR AN INSOMNIAC     "how can you assume to be friends with someone when all you think about when you look at him is how much more you really want?"  ---joey, DAWSON'S CREEK    Don't you understand? That everything I do, I do for you? Anything that might be special in me...is you.  ---GREAT EXPECTATIONS    One day, you look at the person and see more than you did the day before, like a switch was flickered somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is suddenly the only person you can imagine yourself with.  ---Xfiles (series)    "There are some people who meet that somebody that they can never stop loving, no matter how hard they try. I wouldn't expect you to understand that, or even believe it, but trust me, there are some love that don't go away. And maybe that makes them crazy, but we should all be lucky to end up with that somebody who has a little of that insanity. Somebody who never lets go. Somebody who cherishes you forever."  --- Ally Mc Beal
