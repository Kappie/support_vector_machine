My mother has learned about using Voice chat and now my father is going to buy a microphone to do the same. I swear I'll never get any peace now. Being in game design, I rarely encounter any women. All men....its quite irritating. I've always preferred at least some balance. I just get along with women better. Well after months of separation from the opposite sex, I got to met two woman that stay in the apartment next to mine. I'm pretty sure they are just staying with boyfriends, but it was nice to have any contact. I spoke with them again today, I'm guessing it will turn into a "If we are both outside, lets talk" kinda thing. Often people sit outside their apartments to chat, and lately I've spotted her outside too. Last night her and another were acting goofy and eventually I started speaking with them. Last time I had any contact with a girl my age was during my first month at Full Sail in Behavioral Sciences. Christina, a lovely little mid-western girl. I had a brief acquaintance with her. Long enough for me to build a huge crush on her.  From personal experience, I need very little time to development a massive crush on any girl. I'm the sad hopeless romantic. I surround myself with female friends, and one of them I tend to fall for. But in the end I never make any advances so I'm left all alone....high school was a torture thanks to that behavior. Oh well, tis life.  That's it for now. I probably should check on those two hurricanes heading in my direction. Ciao
