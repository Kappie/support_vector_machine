I woke up at about the same time ..... in the A.M. Made me and my bro some breakfast, ate it while watchin Family Guy. Now I'm talkin to Johnny and watchin Real World. Not too bad at all :D.   Eryn is an amazing person. I havn't opened up so easily in a while. Thank ya for that once again! :)   Aight people, I'm gonna haul @$$ outta here, see you all later.
