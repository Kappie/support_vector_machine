His mother said he wasn't home and she'll tell him I called. I'll just call back later. I'm sitting here thinking about what he said and the conversations we had. I told him my weird thing about celebrating one anniversary after a break up. June 4, 2004 would have made 2 months. It sucks that we didn't get any farther, but he said it happens for a reason. That reason is yet to be defined. I found this really nice song by Jennifer Love Hewitt. Read it, it reminds me of my ex and I.   "If you really love me Don't try and change me When you look in the mirror It's not me you see  I don't want your choice as mine No, that never crossed my mind I want you just the way you are 'Cause boy, you're everything I'm not And that's all I've ever wanted  If we ever come close If we ever discover How to hold on and keep our faith in each other The difference between us Will keep us together  If we open our eyes Don't look any further 'Cause we've found all we'll ever need in each other The difference between us Will keep us together  I tell you our love is everlasting You promise to give your best every morning We don't have to compromise Try to live each other's lives We can be ourselves tonight  If we ever come close If we ever discover How to hold on and keep our faith in each other The difference between us Will keep us together  If we open our eyes Don't look any further 'Cause we've found all we'll ever need in each other The difference between us Will keep us together  So don't forget The words I've said There's nothing there I might regret  No, don't play games inside your head What's going on inside your head?  If we ever come close If we ever discover  How to hold on and keep our faith in each other The difference between us Will keep us together Will keep you here, right by my side  If we ever come close If we ever discover How to hold on and keep our faith in each other The difference between us Will keep us together  If we open our eyes Don't look any further 'Cause we've found all we'll ever need in each other The difference between us Will keep us together Will keep you here, right by my side"   The only difference with the song and us is that we didn't love eachother yet but I was starting to. I think he was still waiting for something to happen or me to do something that is like a sign that this will happen. I hope i'll have a chance to talk to him later tonight. I just like hearing his voice. I feel as I'm losing faith and that the odds of him coming back to me are now dwindling as he proboly has moved on. I'm proboly already in the friends zone with benefits. I hope I'm the only benefits he's getting.
