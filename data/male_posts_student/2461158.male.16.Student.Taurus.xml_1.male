Sunday had a great worship service and time with friends. Monday I went out suit shopping with Gael and my dad. We also got some things for our trip. That was about it for Monday. Tuesday we went to Target cause we had got some gift cards for thanksgivng. I got the Two towers, the Pirates of the Carribean, and the Meteora cds. So that was good, we also got a digital camera while we were there so now I have to update my website right? That night we also got a couple of gifts so that we could use 'em before our trip. We also baked cookies that afternooon. Well this morning we iced the cookies. Took Cortez over to the Miller's so they could watch him. Messed with there playstation and finally got it to work so that Heidi and I could race... she beat me. That was fun but we didn't get to stay long enough. When we got home we got ready to go over to a christmas party that was alot of fun. We went caroling around the neighborhood and it was cold but fun. Well I gotta get some rest. Tomorrow were off to Indiana for a week. So It'll be awhile before I post again.
