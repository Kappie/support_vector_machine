Things seem so hectic and stressful lately that it is difficult to enjoy this "now" crap.  My back is in knots with stress.  I will sing a song to myself now, and I will remember the words until I'm past "now" and safely settled into my new life.  I tend to forget, at times, that my future doesn't have a specific start time.  I neglect to remember that the rest of my life will start soon, things will fall into place, and I don't need to push so hard.    "Slow down you crazy child You're so ambitious for a juvenile But then if you're so smart tell me why You are still so afraid?   Where's the fire, what's the hurry about? You better cool it off before you burn it out You got so much to do and only So many hours in a day   But you know that when the truth is told That you can get what you want Or you can just get old You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through When will you realize Chicago waits for you   Slow down you're doing fine You can't be everything you want to be Before your time Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight Too bad; but it's the life you lead You're so ahead of yourself That you forgot what you need Though you can see when you're wrong You know you can't always see when you're right  You got your passion you got your pride But don't you know only fools are satisfied? Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true When will you realize Chicago waits for you   Slow down you crazy child Take the phone off the hook And disappeaar for a while It's alright you can afford to lose a day or two When will you realize Chicago waits for you."
