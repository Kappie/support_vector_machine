Let me recap the happenings of the night before to the night of my first day of school. I went to this banging party the night before...stayed up till around 4:30 5 am...so I got basically 1 1/2-2 hours worth of sleep.... I am such an over acheiver..it was the  excitement of school I tell ya..not really..we just didnt feel the need to go to sleep. So yeah like 3 am that morning we were starving so we left my friends house and went to the local Taco Bell/ Krystal and got us some food! Well, then it was time for us to get ready for school.  SO we all went to school together...we blasted our music when we drove around..."Tear It Up"...We were srtuttin it..we seniors....yeah yeah... Much Love to the Class of 2005!. Welp anyways I about crapped when i got my schedule...it sucked..I had to get it changed right away.. Cuz i was in stupid classes...my schedule was all F'ed up. But I got it fixed and then I went home fell asleep...was soo dead....woke up and went to another party. Awesome life in Mad-ville yo...much love...anyways first full day is this monday...can't wait....ha!   More to come sooner or later...      ~Laterz~
