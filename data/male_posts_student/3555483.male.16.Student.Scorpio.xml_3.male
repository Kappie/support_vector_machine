Anh Proctor adn Steph went that was cool.Vivian didn't... too much traffic and she just decided not to, aww and dat woulda been last time to see her b4 she leaves to Vietnam.. oh well, prolly see her during cardinal camp  and yea.. i guess i haven't done much reflection over sophmore year.. well it was pretty fun. Besides the huge work load, i guess learned that i can't do everything on my own and i needa pray more and rely more on God. I think i drifted a lot this year but in teh same time grew as well. Drifted as in not constant wit quiet times and stuff but i learned a lot about God, and his power. And how he's in control of everythign.   HIGHLIGHTS of the year: CSM, BPA and Kids way definitely, hanging out after school and meeting a lot of knew ppl and getting to know a lot more ppl better this year. Uh.. helpin Steph wit her guy problems ;) haha dat was funni, alex and his bird hunting.. haha thougth that would nvr end, late nite calls wit Ashley dang dat was killer haha sleepign at lyk 4 haha, riding the Metro!! haha dat was fun, finals studying and avoiding ppl lol trying to run from Ahmed haha, err well not much more. i'll prolly think of more later  person i guess impacted my life most, have to be Steph Got to know ehr sooo much better this year through Kid's Way and BPA, and she's just always so.. happy and joyful haha yea she mite freak out and spaz at times, but nvr seen anyone more happy then her. And she's always really open wit me in doing self assessments about her self and i guess in doing so, she's lead me to think about how i'm leading my life in Christ, and helps me in reflecting on myself since i don't do that often.. hehe and I can always count on her to liven up the crowd haha since she's always the loudest one and she's really a very.. complicated person haha. She nvr ceases to amaze me with her jokes and pick up lines lol some i don't get till she does it lyk.. 5 times.. haha not sure if i'm just slow, or her pick up lines are that ineffective lol she's just a super cool person and really blessed to have a frnd lyk her
