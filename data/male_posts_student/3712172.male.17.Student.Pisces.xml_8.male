I had a chicken quesadilla, and I split it with Alley (It was so damn good) I met Alley's sister today, and her 6 week year old baby. Shit, it was the most adorable thing I have ever seen in my life. So beautiful, and innocent. Just think, at one time in our lives we were like that, then we grew up.   It was amazing holding her as well. To possess such innocence and in turn to be holding that piece of innocence is the most amazing feeling in the world. I suppose that's why its so moving when you hold your very own child. I wouldn't know but I have heard.  I work tomorrow from 12 - 6, which isn't all that bad I guess. I really need to drink though. I want some beer in this dealcoholized gut of mine. It's summer time, I gotta get out and have a damn good time! And I need to endure it for 2 months; PARTY TIME!  Work was alright I guess tonight. They had me strictly on the supervisor line so again it was a bit slower. But I had some nasty ass people to deal with. One guy called me a  "worthless piece of shit that should drop dead"  I really enjoy being verbally abused by customers over the phone. (That was sarastic by the way) I guess it's better over the phone though, if it weren't I'd come home with bruises everyday, or even worse, never come home.  Ah well, people are dickheads. I am getting tired so I will head to bed.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   I've written so much stuff on here, it's crazy. Goodnight all.
