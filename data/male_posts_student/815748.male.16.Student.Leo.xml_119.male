We took the multiple-choice section of the WWI test yesterday.  It was fairly straightforward.  We did it in three- and four-person groups; I was with Jake, Lainey, and Eric.  Loren commented that it must have been difficult, given that Eric and I are both so opinionated.  However, most of the questions we agreed on, I knew I was right on the ones on which I fought (though sometimes Eric didn't want to hear my arguments), and in the end, every question that I had an answer to was answered in accordance with my answer.  I did something very unpopular, though: I saw that the short-answer and essay questions that we would answer on Monday were attached to the test, and I asked Ms. Heidlage about it.  She took that sheet from each person and wrote new questions.  My rationale that will hopefully save me from getting beaten up - though already I've been getting very murderous glances - is that when she graded the multiple-choice answers, she would have noticed that the short-answer and essay questions were attached and changed them anyway, so what I did had no ultimate effect.  I've been following through with half of Julia's advice, the other half I haven't been able to accomplish yet.  So far, there have been no bad effects, but no progress either.  It's been easy, the half that I've been doing, since it's consisted of nothing.  I really ought to do the half I haven't been doing, since that's the part that includes doing things.  As it is, it feels like I'm doing the wrong thing, or at least not doing the right thing.  And yes, I'm fully aware that you have no idea what I'm talking about.  I saw The Fog of War with Matt Woolf today.  It was a fairly good movie, but I noticed several problems and so I'm going to write a bad review (for extra credit in history) since they're easier and funner than writing good reviews.  I learned some important lessons, but I don't know whether I will use them or whether I already knew them.  I guess I'll write a mixed review.  Right now, my life deserves a mixed review, it's sometimes awesomely awesome and sometimes suckily sucky.  Whatever.  I can't very well have this end so Melodramatically, so here's a dialogue between myself and Matt.  I can tell it because I had no intention to say it that way.  It was said after he was trying to convince me of something.  Me: I don't know whether to believe you.  It seems like you always start out with something that is a little bit true, and then make it more false and false.  I mean, more and more false. Matt: Haha, more false and false.
