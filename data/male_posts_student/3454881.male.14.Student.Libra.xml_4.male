We may never see eachother again because some of us are going to different high schools. But anyway, have a GREAT summer! I hope everybody has a good time! Shout out to all my friends from Patrick Henry: I'll miss you all going to Lincoln :-(, and I'll see you next year all the Washington Ppl!   Fun times, Jared D.
