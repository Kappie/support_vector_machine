They were only leaving a month early anyways. Feel sorry for the U.S. troops who will be there for the net 10-years (Good morning Viet Nam!). Besides, why should Filipino blood be spilled over the terrible mistake made by the U.S. president by initiating an illegal war? So anyways, here are the facts (as seen by me!):    1) 51 Filipino troops won't make much of a difference when they leave compared to the 140,000 (and growing!) U.S. contingent already there.  2) The Filipino troops were going to leave in 30-days anyways.  3) U.S., Australia, Japan, etc... cry shame on the Philippines? Why? Beacuse the Philippines decides to not become even further implicit in this diabolical scheme concocted by the Bush administration? Kudos to GMA for standing up against them and not being bullied by the so-called 'Coalition of the Willing' or should it be 'Coalition of the Spineless lackey's of the Bush Administration? Funny that the U.S. administration should disagree with GMA when over half of the U.S. citizens disagree with the Bush administration.  4) If we ever do find weapons of mass destruction, it'll be the ones we sold them back during the Regean era if the first place when the Iraq-Iran war was in full-swing (thanks Don Rumsfeld for making the sale back then!).   5) No links to Al Quaida and Saddam Hussein based on a U.S. congressional fact-finding report. Interesting huh Dubya? I'm not surprised really since Osama and Saddam are mortal enemies since Osama is a Islamic fundametalist and Saddam is Socialist (in the loosest terms) dictator. However since the U.S. is in Iraq, 'the enemy of my enemy is now my friend...' Thanks Bush for destabilizing the world and making a far more dangerous place!  6) If it's not about the oil, how come we don't know how many barrels of oil have been taken out of the country? Where is all the money from the oil that's supposed to rebuild the Iraqi infrastructure? How come the only building lfet standing and the first building to be secured was the Oil Ministry and not the Iraqi museum where priceless antiquities dating back several thousand years were looted?  7) Morale is quite different than what the Bush administration says. Less people are joining the military, soldiers are upset that they are receiving paycuts and are forced to stay longer in the military despite their official contracts ending and having to stay longer in the Middle East because there are less troops that can be stationed there (was a 6-month tour, now it's up to almost 15-months). What soldiers would be happy about that? Particularly part-time Reservists and National Guardsmen? More chances to die for a stupid cause of getting Bush and Cheney rich wouldn't make me happy.
