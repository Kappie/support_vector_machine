Most of the jobs want at least two months the least and able to speak mandarin. How I am suppose to know mandarin? I am Indian.   I went to gym today. It was surprising quite packed. I suppose it is the school holidays. I went to have lunch with my buddies after that workout. I ate chicken chop. Shiok man! Thats unhealthy food. When I reached home at about 3, I found out that nobody was at home. I had the whole house to myself. I practised singing and dancing. I do have this talent in singing and dancing. I suppose I am to afraid to showcase my talent. Maybe I can be Singapore Idol if I had registered. In my dreams.  There is still one month before school restarts. Euro 2004 coming up. Looking forward to it.
