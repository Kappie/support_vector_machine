I've gone half way through the game in a couple of days, so that's a whole shit load of playing. I'm suprised my playstation has not overheated.  On another note, I'm going to use roman numerals for everything I write that's a number. All the swoll people do that. It's really masculine too.  So if you catch me using arabic numerals, then you can point it out to me and call me a pussy. Well, until school starts anyway, because doing math would be a bitch with roman numerals. Also, I think my teachers would take off for that.  By the way, if you're a hot girl then I have Friday nights open so we can get it on. Just thought you would like to know.
