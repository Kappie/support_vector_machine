Later, I offered him 2 crappy speakers and my old crappy mouse that didn't have a scroll button and it wasn't optical, and he still refused. Here's the chat transcript of what happened just a second ago.  ShuChoMouff: I am offering to give you ShuChoMouff: a crappy mouse, 2 crappy speakers, and... ShuChoMouff: ready for this? a r n  l e e: uh huh ShuChoMouff: a crappy mousepad. a r n  l e e: OMG a r n  l e e: DEAL ShuChoMouff: hahaha a r n  l e e: FUX0RIN DEAL YO ShuChoMouff: it's really too bad that i don't have the mousepad.  Hahahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahahahahahahaha.  "fux0rin deal yo"
