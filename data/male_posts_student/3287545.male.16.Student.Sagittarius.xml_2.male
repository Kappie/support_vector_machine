Well, actually just graphics English and maths, but I’ve been doin a lot of graphics coursework recently. I’ve just finished é.caf, my design for an Internet café in London, well almost, and I think it’s looking quite good. Not as good as I first pictured it but nothing ever does. The Incredible John Culshaw has just stated on TV and to be honest I don’t really feel like writing much more today. Today at school things were quite good, I was happy, although I had a horribly snotty nose and was spraying  it everywhere. Got a bit of a cold at the moment, I don’t think my nose has never been so blocked. I think the kissing counter is up to five now, if I’m counting right, and I’m stating to get used to it. Where at lip level now, and I think Katie was wearing lip gloss especially. The other day I’ve been trying to avoid kissing because I just don’t really want to and I think she really got this message and has been sprucing herself up. I’m just thinking though, is Katie good looking? You know, I’m not sure, I really can’t tell. Blond hair, blue eyes, smooth skin, I guess that’s a good combo. But her shape isn’t really good. She’s all bulky and, I don’t know, not fat but sort of strangely shaped. Maybe that’s a normal women shape though, thinking about it, a lot of girls are like that I think. I’m not really looking at them though, so how can I be expected to know what looks good in a woman. Right, this’ll do for today, I’m extremely tired.
