It's been way too long. I need one. Last week there weren't very many hot guys there. Hopefully it'll be better this week. :)   Oh. Some crappy news. You probably could care less, butI care a lot. They hired some annoying older (well not that old, but older than ony of the people who already work there) woman at my Starbucks. I'm not a fan. Plus, she has really ugly hair. Eww. The good news is, they also hired a shift supervisor who seems perty cool. He's probably in his 20's, and I'm guessing he's gay by the semi-sparkly belt he was wearing when I met him.   Any way. Thats all for now. If I get to Dream really early again tonight, I'lll probably make an entry. Otherwise, see ya later.
