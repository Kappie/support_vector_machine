It'll be a fun time, kinda... I'm glad I have friends to take my mind off things that I'm constantly thinking about anyways.  Yeah all the time we've spent together talking, thanks cause you've left my heart broken. Maybe someday I'll forget how much you meant to me. Just to let you know, it's not fun waking up and realizing how lonely you are and then not being able to sleep the rest of the night. Sorry. I hope the next time I talk to you I don't see my eyes in yours.   You can sleep in your own bed tonight sleep away a silent pain that's screaming out my name,   you can sleep in your own bed tonight I hope for your sake that you don't wake up as broken as I am.    Sleep in your own bed tonight I know some day that you will wake up as  lonely  as I am  Have a good weekend.
