For those of you who don't know who Miles Davis is, I'm sorry. Anyway, I am typing this at a friend's house because my internet has already been turned off. I am moving in just 3 days, and only about half of my house has been packed, which kind of sucks. No, actually, it really sucks. A lot. Well, I just had a b/day and I got some CDs and a $50 Amazon.com gift certificate. Belle  Sebastian, Hootie  the Blowfish, Nickel Creek,  Nirvana! I'm happy now. Excuse me, but I must go. But before I exit, here's an obscure thing to laugh (or scream in sick horror) at.  What Is The #1 Question Asked To A Person With Checkered Pants?  I think it should be...  "Is that a bishop in your pants, or are you just happy to see me?"
