The day:  Math: homework check, no assignment  Science: finished lab, did assignment  Band: JAZZ DAY!!! And I got a solo on the opening blues!!! Whoohoo! Ok, so it wasn't quite that fun, but it was fun nonetheless. I love playing jazz...  Spanish: The half-hour stall on the usage of Formal and Informal tenses was amazing. I honestly didn't expect it to go on that long. Geez, I swear, Matt can get away with anything. We're working on the formal command form.  English: Continued the sci-fi unit, reading The Cold Equations. Quite a lame little story so far.  Social: Another deadline, well, not really, gone! The test breezed by as quick as something getting thrown out of a convertible on the highway. Ok, bad simile, but w/e. Considering I only studied for a total of about 5 minutes, I did exceedingly well with probably around 2 points out of 80 wrong.  After school: Drum lesson, and eating stuff. However, it was kinda fun out with the dogs. Pepper went bolting down the path, and it turned out we met up with Heather, Asher, and one of their friends. Then there was my really stupid dog and that leash...  Next to no homework this weekend, except for reading The Cold Equations. Shouldn't take that long.  Plans for this weekend: 1. Homework 2. Spending Friday evening at Friday Night Magic at Unicorn Games in Oakdale. 3. Chores 4. Biking, if the weather's good 5. Spending a ton of time on IM 6. Maybe the Underground again this week 7. Practicing music a lot-yeah...I'm a crazy musician...what do you want from me? 8. Not going to my church *gasp*, but I will probably be attending Zion Lutheran. Yeah, I know I'm Catholic, but I like trying out different churches and learning about different religions and stuff. If I can't go there, then I'll attend St. Thomas Aquinas. Either way, I'll get to wear a suit, which is always fun.  Plus with all those concerts coming up, I'll get to wear plenty of suits. Sure is fun looking sharp.  lol, anyway....  I also plan to work a bit on my magic decks, seeing as I haven't played much in a while. I did beat Gray 2 out of 2, well, I probably would have won the second game, at lunch today. My ponza is mediocre, and needs some work, but the mana curve is good.  Maybe I'll go shoot pool on Saturday or something. Yay for long weekends!
