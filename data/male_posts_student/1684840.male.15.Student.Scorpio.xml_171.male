We now have to learn another bloody piece of coursework OFF BY HEART!  I'm sure any day now it will turn round and go "Right, that's it!" and I will be subject to a very bad heart attack.  Seriously, I'm sick of French now, roll on leaving day...    I'm turning into a health freak!  I've been drinking loads of bottled water and eating 'Hamster Food' for breakfast and 'Rabbit Food' for lunch.  I'm telling you know, having been on a healthier diet for about a month now, I can certainly feel the effects.  I feel much more nautral, but when on a caffeine and fat fueled diet I feel full of wasteful energy which makes me all hyperactive and over-confident.  Anyway...  I'll be starting Games again on Thursday.  After a long period out of it due to my asthma I've decided it's time to give it a go again.  Should be fun!  God... Maths!  Mr. Salt invaded the classroom... need I say more?  We received our reports today, which was quite good.  A number of people weren't happy with theirs, although some of them were over exaggerating.  I've been making loads in Adobe Photoshop lately.  Here area few examples:   Planetary   Vortex   Soul   I went round Sam's house after school for a bit and we did some stuff on Adobe, I helped him a bit making planets and stuff.  I can't believe how cool and easy to use the program is.  I used to look upon it and...   We pranked a few people with a few Kerrang! FM sound effects it was funny, I might upload them    G'dnight everyone... yeh
