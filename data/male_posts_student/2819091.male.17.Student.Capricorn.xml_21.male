I know that I am ugly, But you shouldn't flee. That's what destiny made me be. I have no scorn, no regret, no sorrow, Because I will always follow What events will bring me tomorrow.  If I ever lived in regret, I never would have met Such a beautiful person like you. I know that my appearance cannot woo Someone as beautiful as you, But this I promise to you, I'll always be there whenever you need someone to talk to.  No matter how far we are, You know that I'll never be far. You could give a call, And you could depend on me that no wall Will ever let our friendship fall. I will always be in the same place, So if ever you need me, There's no need to trace, I will always be at my base Waiting for you. Always waiting... Never stopping.
