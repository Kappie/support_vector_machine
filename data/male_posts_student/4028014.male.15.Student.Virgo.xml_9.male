Its really really complicated... How i wish i didn't make that decision in the earlier year... Its just so stupid... If i didn't make that decision, i won't land myself in this mess already... However, if i didn't make this deciion, i don't think i will grow... Really... In this triangle, i've learnt alot of things... Especially human... Well, i've learnt that not all people are as good as what they appear... Yes... Believe me... I've a taste of it and its not good... True... People would say that i deserve it... But hey, its my choice and i don't really need you all for comments!!! Yes... I really have to thanks these people as they make me grow stronger and more matured in handling this kind of things... Really... They also thought me things that i believe some of you will never learnt... Whatever it is, i hope that i will not step into another similar triangle... *finger crossed*   Well, i've really nothing to comment about today's activity... I also have to think about the drafts and storylines for the Fanfiction blog... Headache man... Too many things to handle... Yes... I was thinking if i'm going to continue to update my blog daily... Well, i'll try to make it a daily blog... But under some circumstances, i might not be able to write it daily... Like my Prelims... Which will be starting in the 14th of September... Urgh... So fast... Well, secondary 4 live is like that... Hope next year arrive early! Like that i would be able to work, buy new clothes, and make over! Yes! These will be the first thing i'm going to do after O Level...   Well... That's all i'm going to write... See you tomorrow!!!  Quote of the day (from Harry Potter): "Scars can come in handy.
