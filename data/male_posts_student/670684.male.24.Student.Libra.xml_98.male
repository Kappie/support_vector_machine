Leitner not only was the evening sportscaster for the station (as he had been since 1978), but he also did the morning talk show on the AM affiliate, as well as the play-by-play for the San Diego Chargers.  It is tought to imagine this split as amicable in any way, considering  urlLink KFMB  has no mention of Leitner on their website; his presence has already been erased, and no memorial exists.  For those who care, Leitner and the head of KFMB, Ed Trimble, had several shouting matches during the last 12 months, after Trimble fired several employees in an attempt to break the station's union workers.  Leitner is an avid liberal and steadfast supporter of unions, doing commercials for trade unions and speaking at rallies in his spare time.    I grew up listening to Leitner do the sports on the old Hudson  Bauer show at 7:15 am; it was rarely sports, and usually a funny anecdote about the family or something going on in life.  In the 80s and early 90s, Leitner was on top of the sportscasting world, providing a fresh approach to what most considered a serious topic.  However, in the age of Fox Sports and the Jim Rome-inspired shock jock, Leitner comes off as a curmudgeon...while Jim Rome boosts his ego by blasting others, Leitner tells stories and talks about the world...it's harmless, but today it sounds like he's just stroking his ego because he likes to hear himself talk.  And I'm sure he does...he had a talk show in his last few years with KFMB.  The good news in all of this is that Leitner will continue to be the color commentator for the  urlLink San Diego Padres , which will aggrivate many die-hard Padres fans who aren't interested in Leitner's famed question, "What'cha do today, Colonel?"  But I'll smile.  Dammit, I'll smile!  Jimmy Kimmel was much better...he finally felt comfortable on-stage it seemed.  When Al Michaels came on and interacted with the likes of 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, and The Rock, I think Kimmel realized he could too.  And he was funny...hopefully he'll forget that he's the host and instead just try to have fun with the schtick.  The Milk  Cookies gag could've been funny if Kimmel had played it right...but that just takes time.  Ask  urlLink Harry Anderson .  Too bad Austin airs him at 1:00 am, most likely because their syndicated contract with eXtra is too important to move.    My addiction to  Joe Millionaire  is more serious than I first imagined.  At least I haven't bought the authentic  urlLink Celebrity Mole Journal  yet.  Yet.
