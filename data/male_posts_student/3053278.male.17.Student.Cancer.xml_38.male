I said hey to mr. mustilli and then I noticed Jason and Charles at a lawn table and marissa swimming in the pool. Nicole was sitting under a mosquito net writing a paper, almost immediatley my heart sank but i didn't feel to bad when I saw jason going through his black book trying to contact fencers. John and Martha showed up and then marissa and jason went to the store. After they returned Alec and Leslie showed up and we all just enjoyed ourselves. We cooked some burgers and hot dogs and then we goofed around in mustilli's garage. The shrine is just an awesome place to be, so inspiring. I left and then I hung wit julian for the rest of the day
