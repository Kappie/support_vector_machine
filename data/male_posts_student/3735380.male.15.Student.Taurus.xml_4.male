Read it only if you have time on your hands.  Two weeks before this Saturday, I was playing a video game on my computer, which took up the whole screen. No clocks in sight. I was truly addicted to Descent Freespace II.  The only problem is that I didn't know what time it was.  And  I had to work the 3-7 shift.  You can guess. I finally finished a mission, took a look at the clock about 10 feet away. This is the main reason I put the clock next to my computer. It showed 3:16. I threw on my uniform and yelled at my parents for not getting me off the computer in time.  I got there at 3:45. Apparently my parents need to look nice when I'm late. Screw that. I got to work and, well, it almost got me fired.  ~  One week before today, I woke up at 1:40. I remembered what happened last week, so I put on my McDonald's uniform to remind me. The clock was put next to my computer, so I'm not addicted to any games such that I can't see the time.  I played Descent Freespace II again. Great game. I looked at the clock. 2:30. I got off the game, and looked around. No parents. Not a trace. They were at my brother's little league game.  There was a lot of calling during this week. Hang on while I explain.  I waited. 2:45. I started pacing back and forth. I took some sticks of spaghetti and started munching on them, one by one.  2:55 and no sign of anybody. This is going to screw me over. I cursed under my breath, and waited longer. I found a slip of paper. Thank God. It was my parent's cell-phone numbers. I quickly dialed the numbers.  I tried first with my dad's number. No answer. He turned his off. I had one more chance.  I dialed my mom's number. Soon after, I heard a noise on the counter while I had the phone in my hands. I hung up to find out what it was. I didn't see it. It was probably a mouse.  I dialed again. I heard the noise when the ringtone went off on the phone. I searched and found it. It was my mom's cell phone. She left it home.  Okay, this would get me fired for sure. It was already 3:15 and I was due to work the 3-7 shift again. This is not working out.  I took the entire box of spaghetti and started eating the pieces one by one, like a nervous serial killer. It was 3:30. I had already finished half the box when the phone rang. I jumped, hoping to God that it was my parents.  It wasn't. It was my boss. She wanted to know why I wasn't there. I explained that I had no method of transportation. She understood. Thank God for that.  Fifteen minutes later, 3:45, I ate the box of spaghetti at twice the speed. Where were they? What the heck is wrong with them? If I wanted to get to work, I had to walk. Real creative. Two miles. My bike was broke, so I couldn't take that. I could take my brother's bike, but it was way too small.  3:55 already. I turned to the news. I opened another box and started munching. If my parents got home in time, I'd owe them an explanation, but by the looks of it, they owed me a bigger one.  4:05 and the car came through the drive through. Lucky me, to be an hour late for work. I started yelling when I got into the car. This was the second week in a row. The hour late got me on  really  close watch with the management. If I was late again, it was my job. Nobody told me that, but it was in the handbook.  ~  This week was actually more in control. Saturday. Finally a chance to get to work  early . I woke up at 11:00 with my mom flushing the toilet in my room. I yelled at her to fix it, because it had an inner leak that kept it running and running, and she didn't know how. I turned off the lights in my room. Hardly noticed it was on. I told my mom to not forget that I had work today. She left for my brother's game.  Okay, the next few things happened exactly like last week. I tried calling. No answer. At 2:57 my mom came home today. Speeded my way to work, which I thought would kill us all. I got there, but I wasn't on time.  One minute late. Could that get me fired? I stood there with a pale face for at least 20 minutes.  Luckily, no managers came by and fired me. I was still alive. I still had my job.  When I clocked out, I looked at the paper. 15:01 - 18:25. At least I walked out with that slip. I still have my job. I still have my meal. Everything was okay.  I sat down and ate my food with relief. I called my parents up to take me home. They agreed. Some guy sat across from me. It scared me when he tried to converse with me. Maybe he was lonely. Maybe he wanted my food. Maybe he was aâ€”no, not today. I picked up my food and said I was going to check the time.  Checking the time took 20 minutes. Why weren't my parents here? I nervously stood there facing the door, out of sight from him.  What was wrong? Does it always take this long for my parents to pick me up?  My supervisor is really starting to worry about me leaving late at 7:30, when I get off at 7. Repeatedly. My parents either don't have their cell phones on or leave them at home. My supervisor is really becoming wary about that.  My parents seriously need a built in clock for their brains. Even that might not help. Finally, at 7:10, I took up my stuff and finally left. The happiest face I wore since I got my job there.
