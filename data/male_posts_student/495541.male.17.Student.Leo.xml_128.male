Gives me an upset stomach sometimes, like it did today.  Yeah, that wasn't good.  We went home then to Wal-mart and then to Sam's Club.  First time I've been in Sam's Club.  It was exactly as I pictured it.  That was weird.  I think that store is too big though.  I walk all the way to the back by the meat section and I'm already tired of walking.  I suggest they make scooters you can ride around for shoppers and I'm not talking about just for the disabled.  I mean for the extremely lazy people like myself.  Oh well, I got some goods there.  Some Welcher's grape juice and some off the hizzle muffins.  Also got some DVDs.  One of them was  About a Boy .  We watched that this evening.  I thought it was really good.  The Audi TT in the movie = off the hizzle wizzle fo shizzle.  Wow.  I went online to the Audi website and took a look at how much it would cost me a month to buy one.  It ended up being over $700 a month for a 48 month, 1.9 APR, $1000 down financing.  Now that's crazy.  How am I going to come up with that kind of money?  I guess I'm not, or hey I could just plan on winning the lottery.  That or I could deal with the fact that I'm never going to get more than a 1:24 scale die cast Audi TT.  Oh well.  Played about a billion games of pool with Whit tonight.  Always a pleasure.  :-)  Pool is off the hizzle as well.  I ended nicely with a 3 game streak, but I got the 8-ball and cue ball in both so many times... wow.  Tight.. good night.
