We were very shocked by the whole thing, so we asked my friend Tamika about it, and she screamed:    " Get out!.. No kidding?! I am so sick of hearing about  the Dark Ages all the time! "    But then when my friend and I got to the part about the luck, Tamika ran away all of a sudden. And then this morning, Tamika's brother told me that the reason Tamika was so freaked out was because she used to write a lot about luck. Sometimes Tamika can be a little  unpredictable like that, but she kinda loves me...      Link of the day:   All Your Oil...  | Randomly generated by  urlLink  Flooble Instant Blog Post Generator    lol.  I TOTALLY GOT A GMAIL INVITE.  exciting but it shouldnt be.  I have to work on my thing for Steph today ;).  Can't say what it is though because she reads this.  Sorrryyyyy Stephanie.  OK OK I've decided that if I get some invites of my own to gmail I'm gonna give the first one to Tom, the second one to Tommy, and the third one to a soldier in Iraq because they're over there fighting and I hope if I donate this a soldier can talk to their family and maybe even receive some video of their kids or something since the mailbox is so big.  I LOVE YOU SOLDIERS IN IRAQ!  Oh God I'm spiraling into not happiness (I dont want to say the word sad it seems to make me that way) but I'm kind of numb because I've had a lot of sugar.     -- I'm sorry I can't be perfect.
