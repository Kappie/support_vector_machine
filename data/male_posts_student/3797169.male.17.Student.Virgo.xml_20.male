I went to the White Castle website to find the location in Cherry Hill, New Jersey where Harold and Kumar end up, but it wasn't there! There's no White Castle in Cherry Hill! But there are 3 in the general vicinity. Plan: go to each location and take pictures and compare them to the movie. If I have a dvd system in my car though, I won't need to compare really, just drive up and look.      Anyway, we're of to see the Castle, the wonderful Castle of White!
