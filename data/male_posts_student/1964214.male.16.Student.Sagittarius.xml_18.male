Chapter 5- The cold war After the pri 5 exams.. when sugar found out tt she was goin to 6E instead of continuing in 6D, during the school hols.. our pen-pal habit went on.. until one faithful day when i got a letter from her. it spoke of how we should stop "loving" each other and concentrate on our studies.. it was the day i discovered a new emotion.. rejection. i felt like the world was al black and white. and a hint of anger was birthed in me.. over wht.. i couldnt tell.. over myself? over the whole thing?? just over something.. didnt reply her letter.. didnt noe how to.. wht to write.. whether to go wif the flow and put on a brave front? or express my dissapointment.. couldnt tink.. so decided to remain silent.. when the new term started.. we went back to school.. stil feelin screwed up.. the yr started off lonely and sad.. cant really remember how the yr actually started.. but it certainly wasnt bright and colorful.. i might have faked a few smiles to entertain some friends but deep down... i was really gloomy. the yr went by, and when i saw sugar along the corridors or in the canteen.. i would pretend tt i didnt know her.. and just go about my business ignoring her.. looking back.. i am surprised that i could avoid her for one whole yr.. in such a small place.. ha.. i remember this teacher tt taught me eng and sci.. the 1st lesson we had. and i was already punished.. but there after.. she bacame my favourite teacher.. her teaching was the best of all the others.. somehow.. she felt like a mother in school to me.. haha.. i respected her and looked forward to her lessons.. haha.. this could be due to my liking in the subjects she taught.. sci was always in me.. somehow.. i feel like its already been implanted in my brain the moment i saw light.. my dad used to prais me when we were to do those manly things like fixing lights and all. one time.. we bought a fan.. and i put it together haha.. he was left with his mouth wide open staring at the fan i assembled.. ok.. im digressing.. back to pri 6 life.. somehow.. we were brought back by affinty.. ha.. as if there was such a thing.. but i bought a nike bag that was exactly like hers.. only different in colour.. haha.. it became the talkin pt of the whole level.. soon after.. i recieved this letter from her again.. i thought she was givin us another chance.. my life lit up again.. it was abt the end of the yr. PSLE was comin.. but i was too engrossed in the superficial things i occupied myself in tht i didnt bother abt the national exam comin.. i thought all would be lost after the exam.. including her.. but... well tt i shall leave to the next chapter.. so chill this is already a book.. haha
