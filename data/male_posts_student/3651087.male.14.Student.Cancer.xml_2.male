For me I can say that love is something that takes 2 person to form it .And there are factors for making love work they are:   -Trust -Sacrifice -Care -Jealous -Money  You may find it funny why I say Jealous and Money makes love work.   Jealous   It is because if your partner is jealous of you and someone being together then that shows that your partner cares for you .Your partner gets angry and when he/she shows it that shows that he want you to change at some parts. But if your partner is not angry then your relationship with him/her is facing a problem.   Money   You will need money to make love work too because if you don't have money then you may not be able to fufill what your partner wants .Money? The amount needed does need to be great but as long as it is enough for your expenses then it would be fine.  So love your partner and always check that whether is there any problems arising between u 2 .   What I have posted here is just what I personally think about love so if u don't agree please tell me so that I can have a better aspect of love.
