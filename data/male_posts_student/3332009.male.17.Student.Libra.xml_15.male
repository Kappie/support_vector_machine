It was flying all over the kitchen. Finally it stopped flying and  I quickly took the kitchen board and whack it. Cockroaches are just so damm irritating. The worse was about to come. I went back to my hall and sat down on the sofa. A hornet flew in. I was so scared. I picked up my courage and told myself if I can kill a cockroach, than I can kill this stupid hornet. But this hornet is one smart creature. It was always fooling me. Finally, I managed to kill it. During the match, my so called pet in my house kept on irritating the hell out of me. I am talking about lizards. Lizards tend to be very active late at nite. It kept on moving acoss my ceiling. I thought it was  going to drop. The insects and lizards really distracted me from watching the game.  My fren called me up today and told me that he had two free tickets for the Linkin Park concert. But he told me later that I must pay $30 for it. I told him forget it. Besides I dont really like Linkin park. They are really not my cup of tea. Hoobastank rulz.
