Usually I can't do two things at once, unless it is music related, but today, I managed to watch three entertaining sporting events at once and not miss anything.  First I woke up to watch the Men's French Open Final.  It was Gaston Gaudio v. Guillermo Coria for the coupe.  I started watching just after the third set.  Coria was two games away from the championship but Gaudio won three straight games to force a fourth set.  During the first game of the fourth set, Coria injured his left leg.  It was so bad he couldn't even run.  He just hobbled around trying to catch every ball that was hit to him, but couldn't catch most of them.  Coria gave away the fourth set to Gaudio.  The time it took Gaudio to win the fourth set was enough for Coria to recover from his injury.  He came back in the fifth set to reach championship point  three times .  However, Gaudio came back, won the game and tied up the fifth set 6-6.    It was time for breakfast so I had to leave this riveting match to eat an omlette.  When I got back, I turned on the telly just in time to see Gaudio smash a tremendous forehand past a frozen Coria to win the French Open.   After doing a bunch of stuff to get ready for my Italy trip, it was time to watch the NASCAR race from Dover.  My favourite driver, Tony Stewart, was ripping stuff up.  Later it was time to watch the New England Revolution v. Columbus Crew match online and the USA v. Japan women's international friendly.  I had the Crew v. Revs match on the computer and the race and USA v. Japan on split screen on the TV.  I was watching the race when I walked back to the computer just in time to see Frankie Hejduk score for Columbus.  One-nil Columbus.  After watching a little bit of the game, I changed the channel to the USA v. Japan game and I was just in time to watch a Japanese player score on a breakaway.  One-nil Japan.  I went back to watching more of the Crew v. Revs game when I tuned in to the race.  I was just in time to witness a big ass crash.  About 20 cars piled up in turn 4.    I went back to the Revs v. Crew match, A PENALTY!!!  Hejduk cut down Steve Ralston in the box.  Jose Cancela chipped a shot and made Crew 'keeper Jon Busch dive the wrong way.  1-1.  Back to the USA v. Japan match and someone from the USA scored.  I think it was Abby Wambach, but I cannot be sure. 1-1.  Back to the Crew v. Revs match for ANOTHER PENALTY!!!  Jeff Cunningham got tripped in the box, got up, and buried the penalty to give the Crew a 2-1 lead.  Pat told me that the Cubs were about to win.  I switched over to the Cubs v. Pirates game to watch the last out.  Cubs won 4-1.  I switched back to racing in time for the green flag.  After a few laps of racing, Casey Mears blew an engine spilling oil on the track.  No caution.   A lap later, Kasey Kahne, in first place with 20 laps to go and pulling away, slipped on the oil, smashed into the wall and took about five other cars with him.  I was helping my mum cook dinner when it was time for my break.  I was just in time to see Mark Martin win and Tony Stewart finish second.  I went back to the USA v. Japan match.  The final whistle blew and the match ended 1-1.  I walked back to the computer to see a THIRD PENALTY!!!  In the second minute of stoppage time, the Revolution had a chance to tie the game up.  Cancela chipped the ball on goal again, but Busch was too smart and tipped the shot over the crossbar to give the Columbus Crew a 2-1 win.  My timing was spot on all day.  I am a lucky bastard.  Practice tomorrow on Fedora Field.  Full report tomorrow.  See y'all.
