Really, really, exceedingly great.  I'll tell you more about her once I take care of what I was talking about in the introduction...   JazzmnJim:  if I ever develop the temperment necessary to hold national office, Kat, I'll have you to thank for it  So yeah... if, in my acceptance speech somewhere down the line, I neglect to thank Kat Murdough, call my office.  I'll buy a 15-second commercial on TV specifically thanking her for sanding down my rough edges.  Okay, so besides her propensity for grounding me when I'm on an irrational political rant, Kat is a really spectacular poet.  And me saying this... this sort of thing doesn't happen often, and I'll tell you why...  I love poetry.  Love it.  But, in my splendidly biased mind has always been the unyielding opinion that everything that could/should be written in the poetic genre has already been written.  Longfellow, Whitman, Keats, Yeats, Byron, Frost... they did it.  They understood it.  It has always been my opinion that poetry written by people I grew up with, or who were around my age, was cursed to be either overly saccharine or histrionic, but undeniably a cheap knock-off of something that was already written a hundred times better by the aforementioned types.  That is to say, I don't like reading poetry written by people around me.  I stand corrected (is someone making a note of this?).  When Kat and I met through our mutual friend Melody, Melody told me that Kat was a poet.  "Great," thought I, as I rolled my eyes, "I'll try not to hold that against her."  Then Kat gave me something she wrote.  And then sent me something else she wrote.  And something else.  And to say that I've loved reading every word that Kat has sent me may  almost  do it justice, but probably not quite.  Kat understands me... probably too well.  And she doesn't let me get away with things she knows I'm too smart to try to get away with.  I won't explain that, but she knows what I mean.    All this to say, I've been blessed with many wonderful friends, and I'm forever thankful that Kat, to mention one specifically, is among them.
