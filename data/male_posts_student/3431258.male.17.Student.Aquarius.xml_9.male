It was inevitable, i would discover a True Multiplayer showdown. Here it is : Soldat. I would like to give details about it, but it has to be discovered on your own. As a 10 meg file (Free) You have the  OBLIGATION  to try it, it's goddamn original! Here is a list of server i play on : http://lobby.soldat.pl:13073/ . I am Lucidique In-Game. One thing great about that server list is that if you have the game installed, just click the link and the game will start in the server!   Soldat Client(10.3Mo)   http://www.soldat.pl/  No Gincana Today, i slept until 10, looks like english class will be reported again...
