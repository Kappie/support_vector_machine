You fucking little shits steal games before they're released, and put them on the internet ILLEGALLY, and now HL2 could be delayed INDEFINITLEY!!!  WHY?!??! why start it in the first place?  I don't see the fucking thief's reasoning.  "To everyone saying this is no Beta: I'd like to point out that THIS is what you wanted Valve to release on 9/30/03, theres no such thing as a much better release in Valves network!  I suggested to Valve to stop lying to their customers about how much was stolen. However, they disregarded my statement and called me a liar. Now they will see how much I have been lying when I release the Pre-Gold and all 100 per cent of the sourcecode. Actions speak louder then words. "  Okay, so he's stolen HL2, and just because Valve calls him a liar(which they have good reason that he is), he thinks valve has done the wrong thing and threatens to destroy HL2 for good?  Already, a third of the sourcecode has been stolen, and HalfLife2 will prolly be delayed until April 2004, to rewrite what was stolen.  But now, it might be fucking YEARS, i wouldn't be surprised if Gabe Newell went around the offices tomorrow and smashed EVERY FUCKING COMPUTER out of existence because of the thief.  If i ever meet that guy, you can guarantee I'm gonna beat his ass. Even if he's a fake. Just for him to see what he's caused. Sometimes violence is the answer. It's all these idiots understand.
