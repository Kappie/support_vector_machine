My best friend Brock and I, and hopefully our friend Rachel, will be driving across the nation, U-HAULS in tow, ready to make a new life in San Francisco, CA.  While I'm not nervous or scared, I think that it is my subconscious that is protecting me from a massive anxiety attack.  Or, maybe I'm perfecting the ol' ostrich with his head in the sand trick.  The reality of the move just hasn't hit me yet.  I'm actually really excited about it!  But for the next month, I don't even want to think about it.  I don't want to start the  planning for the future slash be nostalgic for the past  phase of summer until at least mid-June....or maybe late June....whatever.  And as time progresses, the move seems to make more and more sense.  The last of my engaged friends are getting married, babies are starting to be announced, and the age of mid-twenties is fast slipping into the dreaded 'maturity' of the late-twenties.  One of my favorite quotes from the movie  Singles  is when Bridget Fonda says "Somewhere around 25, bizarre becomes immature."  I'm just trying to work all of this craziness in before the imminent age of immaturity strikes.  On this day in history, Trey announced that Phish was breaking up at the end of the summer.  I don't know, it just seems like life is screaming that we're getting older and its time for a drastic change.  And, to add insult to aging injury, since I do still live in a college town, it seems that every new girl that I meet was in high school when I graduated...from college, that is.  When you keep hearing things like 'Well, I never listened to Jane's Addiction, but my big sister was way into them', then you know something is up.  Yeah, its definitely time to move.
