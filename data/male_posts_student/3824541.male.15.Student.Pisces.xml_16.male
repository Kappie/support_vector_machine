I'm kicking myself for choosing Health Wellness, a blow-off class, instead of another science. That choice is going to screw up the rest of my year. It's driving me crazy that instead of something that could help me I took a blowoff class. Omg. It's driving me crazy.  On a lighter note: I went down to the pool today.  Who knows what I'll do tomorrow.    .After the Credits  Watch 'The Assistant' on MTV. It rocks.
