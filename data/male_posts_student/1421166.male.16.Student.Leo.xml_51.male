And I just had my Student Life meeting tonight, and I've been assigned to do quite some stuff. So guess I'll busy for the next two months, especially with the handover coming up. And if then, if I do get any heavy post, l'll be more busy. So guess time  management has gotta be there. I've gone thru alot of thinking recently, and in fact I think there are reasons why I could and should go to Australia. However, now, I'm leaning to more towards the side of not going, cause I guess the whole thing will affect me negatively in a spiritual way. So I guess I'll tell my parents soon. Anyway, I think I'll be able to serve better if I stay, and even ground myself spiritually. Gotta run along. Anyway, thanks to those people who talked to me recently, I really appreciate it...and needed it too. See U people! Hopefully I'll be here more frequent.
