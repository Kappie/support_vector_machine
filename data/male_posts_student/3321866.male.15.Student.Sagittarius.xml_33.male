Two cops look over the body to  find the cause of death. The Chief comes by to find the results.  CHIEF: Did you find the cause of death?  Cops look up at chief.  COP: We believe it's the knife in his back sir.  ******************************************LINE***************************************  END OF RANDOMNESS!!!  WOOHOO! Staying' up is fun and watching  [Adult Swim]  is cool cause I get to see show like  Wolves Rain  and  Cowboy Bebop   and after watching those shows I realize that the DVD's of Bebop will be at Comic-con and that's a great and funny and cool show. Silent Hill is Fuckin' scary to watch or play! Chris, Alec, and I played it at his house after a game of Mario Party 1 and *shivers Pictures image of a bloody basket ball hoop with a dogs head underneath.* Awesomely Scary!
