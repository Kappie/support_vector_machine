I have assignments calling to me from the abyss of my school bag but I'm sitting here for hours on end, idling my time away. I have a GP test next week which I haven't even begun reading for. I have to finish a presentation on "The experiences of war" by tonight coz the draft's up for vetting by tomorrow- thesis statement and all. I have to finish my "An ode to the school bag" as soon as possible coz the dateline for YAWP (HCJC poetry competition) is on the 19th. Moliere is coming up on the 30th and 31st and I'm struggling to sell tickets. I have to go through "Market structure" again.  It's good, this blogging. Keeps things in perspective.  Han and Nurul came over today and experienced GOOD 'OL AC CULTURE! HURRAH! Bloody school. I'm embarrassed to be here. All that glitters isn't gold. Talking about blood, I'll be donating on Friday. Looking forward to it. Chill out time with metal in arm.  To God be the glory. I passed my Geog exam. Which is like a WOW! Pretty fluke-ish if you ask me. But I'm grateful nonetheless. Is that one word? And I SCORED A WONDERFUL 31 MARKS FOR TAMIL TOO! Out of a hundred. HAhahahaa!  I'm falling back where religion is concerned. Have to alter this distressing course. And I HAVE TO GET CRACKING ON THE BIG BAND GIG ASAP!!!  Keep me in prayer... Whatever truth there is in that.
