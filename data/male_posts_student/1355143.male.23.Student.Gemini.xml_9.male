Nobody appearing around a corner, no recognisable back of heads, nothing!  Rather weird to be back, went out last night to Cafe Royale and then Otto Zutz.  Left when they kicked us out and showed all the new kids in town my stunning moves on the floor.  I think thats why they arent really talking to me any more!  Wieteke has been busy fulfilling her role as social secretary and done a pretty good job.  She has picked out the best of the bunch for me and Steffen and so life will go on!  Anyone wanna visit, just let me know, until then,  A
