I think I did well on most of them but since I have no concrete grades, and I second guess myselfs on a test and after I have no idea how the hell I did. I'm still kinda down with the whole moving thing and the bad feelin is creepin up on me now more than ever. I'm totally gonna miss everyone at East, and especially you Ashley! I wove you!! ^.^ I'm starting to get packed up, gettin all my junk together since we're movin down to Myrtle Beach Wendesday. Yeah... So I'm just sorta... awaiting the inevitable I guess. And NO ONE Had  a party for me!!!! I feel left out now! Just joking, but oh well. Thats it for now! Bye!
