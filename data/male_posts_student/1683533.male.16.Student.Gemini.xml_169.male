A few select U.S. Midwest and Canadian dates are being planned for September as well as a San Juan, Puerto Rico date slated for late August. They will post the specifics at the  urlLink website  when they're closer to being confirmed. A new album will be recorded this fall and released early next year.  In other news, Brad or whoever runs the Before I Go website apparently bought a tortoise:  "I also bought a tortoise. He will grow to be 200 lbs. and live for over 100 years. It's the best thing I've ever done."  I'm not sure if its true or not.  As for our bands news, quite frankly, we are slacking off badly.  We haven't practiced in god knows when.  It has to do with everybody going on vacation.  Anyways, a break is good, I need time to write stuff.  We are unsure of a name, but we might go with Step 12.  It means like, you know those step 12 programs from AA and etc? They all are pretty much the same and step 12 is always something like: "Take the things you learned and share them with people around you".  So in a way you can see our music as being step 12...  Anyways, the PA system is amazing and I can't wait to see it in action even at practice which I hope will be soon.  Well that's all for now I guess, bye.
