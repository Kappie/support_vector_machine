The first time, was below his house and someone had to pick him up. And the second time, was after his lunch yesterday and my Pati couldn't even get him up! OH GOD! And he's been down with a high fever for the past 2 days and he's been shaking and shivering and all! OH GOD!!!!    I FEEL LIKE CRYING! He's my family and he brought me up and he's NEVER been mad at me! HE walks me down when I go to his place and puts me in the cab home. I kiss him when I see him and I kiss him when I part. I'm never afraid to hold his hand. When I was little, he quit smoking for me and stopped drinking too! This is all the tip if the iceberg! Oh God! He's 70 and I proposed a toast at his and Pati's birthday. That theybe with usfor a long time more.    I won't be going for the Rashammon showing at FMSS tomorrow. I'm gona rush down to SGH. I know I shouldn't be along this train of thought right now, but it is and I can't help it. Oh God! And what's more, with what's happened to Zel's granny and Eric's mum and ARGH! I can't help thinking about it.     Pray friends. For his health and salvation. The latter being the priority. Have to have intercession before it's too late.
