I'm guessing the taper was on the otherside of the bar cause you can't hear the frat boys asking what the weather would be the next day during Reservations.   From the hours of 9:30 to 11 I did some serious hunting for jobs on-line.  I have a meeting with a Career counselor on Thur. and I'm hoping things will start rolling quickly.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but the entry level jobs for the PR firms I've been looking at are in LA and San Diego!  Wouldn't that be glorious?  Champaign is nice in the fact that no one is around, but that also contributes to why I'm so incredibly lonely.  Home does have people, just a few I care not to see.  Oh I'm fickle.  Ps  I blame the late hour for my exuberance of using such words as "marvelous," "glorious" and "exuberance"
