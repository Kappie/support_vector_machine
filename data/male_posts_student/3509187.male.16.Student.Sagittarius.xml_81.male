Well... hope yall had a rip roarin' good time this past weekend.  I know mine was pretty good.  Hmmm so I already forget what I was going to say when i set out to write this post... o well it will come to be evenually... i'll just ramble til then. Miss Pangborn is my hero of the day... I think it was last year that I was talking to a friend about how teachers never taught us basic grammer. Upto a certain grade the teacher never made you use grammer vocab, but just helped you make your sentences better.  Then after that point teachers assumed that you learned it all the year before and never even reviewed much.  I remember my sisters teaching me what a noun is and that was the only basic grammer i learned for years.  In 7th grade we touched on some of it but it was a more advanced level.  To day Miss Pangborn took the period to teach all the basic grammer.  Stuff I pretty much knew from picking up little bits over the years, but never knew how it all worked together... For that I have to say "THank You MIss Pangborn"  Well then... I'd have to say I will miss some of my teachers very much, much more so than last year... also I will miss a lot of the classes I have, I got pretty lucky with the people in my classes.  Bio has to be one of the greatest bunch of people I've had in a class since 7th grade English, which was pretty great.  Any suggestions to where I should apply for a job? I was thinking Cold Stone (thanks for the idea Robin), Weis (right near school nice and easy), or Rag 'n' Bone (awesome place, sadly not hiring).  If you have any ideas I woudl be happy to hear...   Well I will leave you now... Forgive my rambling please, until later...  -Dan V
