Webcam!....I stub my toe....LIVE now =P   Yup, I don't see what's so amusing about a webcam, other than the fact that you can see yourself stub your toe, eat carrots, and make others watch you as you stub your toe, eat your carrots, and run around the house looking for more carrot dip, scream in agony after stubbing your toe on your subwoofer, and attempt to use camera flash on the webcam. So yeah...that's my evening from 9-10....as for the rest of my day...  My day started in the morning, ate, TV, and then headed to UCC to do Bible study with Wendy and Josh. After that for 45 minutes, I then bought a 6 pack of donuts and then ate 4/6. Josh stole the other two. Then afterwards I worked out, balled with Jason, and came home.  Yeah and right now I'm still trying to fix my camera so it actually works....well. Other than that, meh....probably going to sleep soon. I'm dead tired.  Later.
