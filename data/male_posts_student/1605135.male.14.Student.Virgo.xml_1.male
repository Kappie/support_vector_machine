Then I tried gmailswap.com, but I haven't seen anyone there give any invites for anything other than money.  Even the site owner is using the site to sell his invites, for more than they go for on eBay.  I even got ripped off once, which is pretty sad considering the item I "swapped" was worth 99 cents (an iTunes song).  There are some sad, sad people in this world.  Today I was going to try Orkut, a community service from Google, which is supposed to have a community of people sending invites, but then I found that's only 18+ years old.  Sure, I lie about my age plenty online, but I don't when signing up for anything where I'd be interacting with others.  I know from experience that it's VERY difficult to keep an age bluff up in any online community .  But I digress.  So now I'm trying Blogger.  Hopefully I can become an "active" member and get myself an account before it becomes public.  More random ramblings later, time to watch the important last quarter of the TWO HOUR American Idol finale.
