       
      I had a political discussion with one of my friends the other day. He's a republican (!) (all republicans will discard the exclamation point there, please) and I, a democrat, was asking him why. We ended up having a heated debate over public school prayer, separation of church and state, and English as the national language. Suffice it to say, arrgh.   arrgh.
