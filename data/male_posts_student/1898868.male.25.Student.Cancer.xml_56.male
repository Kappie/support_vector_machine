So every time we talk about logistics, like loans or housing, he says, "David, have you found your housing for Penn State yet?" And I get really mad, and tell him that I'm not going to Penn State. And he says something like "Whatever."  I thought that you guys would find this hilarious, and would want to refer to my school forthwith as Penn State.  In other news, I miss GR, The Captain, The Silver Fox, and Mr. Stava. What rich individuals.
