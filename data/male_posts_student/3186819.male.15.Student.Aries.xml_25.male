She is a beautiful female golden retriever...The ad goes as follows:  "GOLDEN RETRIEVER Female, 2.5 yrs. Obedience trained  friendly with people. $600. o.b.o. 905-648-2172."  -Ad placed in The Hamilton Spectator. Ad added May 18th (yes, today), 2004.  Now I doubt anyone who reads this blog will be able to afford a $600.00 dog. Well, afford, maybe. Want? Thats a whole different can of worms. The ad should of said this  "GOLDEN RETRIEVER Female, 2.5 years, spayed, shots, trained, good with people $600.00 or best offer 905-648-2172"  But nonetheless 4 people called today. So far, in my mind, I have chosen the people. They just recently lost a golden retriever (died) and has another golden retriever who is in shock over the death. They are good with dogs and are looking for another golden retriever in order to cheer up the dog surviving.  This hurts like a bitch (no pun intended). Do all bad things come in bundled packages? It seems like it. Mom gets admitted to the hospital, Chelsie is being sold, Jeff is being an idiot, and school is into crunch time. Why do bad things do that? Do they just wait for other bad things, and hop on the bandwagon? It seems to be so.  If he sells this dog, I will never forgive him. I won't hate him, but I will have definately lost uber amounts of respect for him (and he was already working from a deficit). However I do realize that it is for the best. She is affected me mom's health, she is cooped up in the basement all day (with only a short bit outside), she is alone a lot of the time (but she absolutely adores people), and she is too big and loud for where we live. But why did they get her if they knew that this would happen. God only knows why they did this. It is making me go on an emotional roller coaster and I am dying of pain. Not all the money in all the world, not all the lyposuction, plastic surgery in all the world, nothing in the world will make me feel better. Haven't I been jabbed in the heart too many times in these short 15 years? Haven't I suffered enough? For heaven's sake, how much is ONE person expected to take. If the first 15 years have been like this, is the worst yet to come?   I have to stop writing, because pretty soon my eyes are going to be too clouded by tears to do anything.  Goodnight and God Bless, Bobert  P.S. The dog is still for sale, so if any of you need a $600.00 dog, give 905-648-2172 a jangle...
