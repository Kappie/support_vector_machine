He only got about 9 hours so it wasn't like he was getting that much more than usual.  The day started out great though as Tyke was walking to class and he found out right away before even entering the class that there was a sub in 1st period.  Wow, now that was quite a blessing.  So Tyke and Maniak walked to his Maniak's locker and told the teacher that they were going to "watch Varsity TV."  But Tyke realized they really had nothing to do so he just went back inside the class.  He played some poker though and ended up losing a buck by going all in on the first hand.  Oh well, it was a fun time.  He was the dealer after that and he showed his insane dealing skills.  So that was pleasureful.  After that he went on over to 2nd period weight training.  It was a good time as it was cardio day and that means...8 MINUTE ABS!!!!  Tyke is not being sarcastic when he says he loves doing ab-work.  He truly does do ab stuff a lot, as you may have noticed from his away message.  He isn't going to brag though and say he has a definitive 6-pack or anything like that...he'll just leave that to the imagination of the female readers of this blog.  You know who you are.  Mmm yeahhhhh.  3rd period involved another sub.  So it was dub-sub day.  They were "watching" a video on the Republican Contract with America but really they were playing Hangman and dressing Purdy up as Tyke.  Wow, now that was a hot sight.  Nothing like seeing a girl dressed up like you and the freakish resemblance she can bear to you.  But the glasses and hat were hot.  Tyke pwned Dotti's Hangman choices but they were indelibly sweet and her mellifluous (sweet sounding, kinda like euphony-bold word from ch. 19 in AP Eng by the way)voice made the sensation of victory even more enjoyable.  4th period was great cuz Tyke and the class just listened to music the whole period.  And it was supposed to be educational too.  Tyke of course made up his hilarious dances and sang along to the recognizable tunes.  Man he's a good dancer.  He should have his own dance show like that one guy did on MTV.  Whatever his name was.  He wasn't as hot as Tyke so it would be even better if Tyke did it.  He could call it "Tyke Turner's Tremendous Tango, Tap, and Twist Telecast."  But they would do more than just tango, tap, and twist.  They would do all sorts of dancing.  Like DDR stuff.  And rave dances.  Ya know, where you make a ball with your hands.  Tyke does that a lot.  He sucks, but he does it a lot.  But no dance twister.  Damn that game.  Good gift but it kinda ended up sucking.  It isn't twister and it isn't dancing.  So it's really a lie in the title of the game.  Maybe Tyke could sue and make some money.  Oooooo...money.  Where was he?  Ahh yes, lunch.  The gang went out to McDonald's again for lunch.  Tyke, Amed, and Doc P ran to the car cuz it was so nice out.  Something Macaroon NEVER does.  Stupid man.  He should do that.  It is wicked fun.  It was sooooo warm and just NOSome out.  Tyke just rolled down the window and put his left arm out while driving.  It's kind of funny how Tyke drives out to lunch every single day.  He does it by his own accord (not the car) and seems to revel in its splendiferous nature.  Mmmm...vocabulary.  Upon re-arrival from lunch and the walk towards the school Tyke looked out towards the parking lot and for some odd reason he saw this van parked in the Visitor stall and it caught his eye.  He noticed the rims and thought, hey those look like the ones on his mom's.  He can tell cuz the rims on his mom's are kinda cool and not normal.  Well he kept walking and noticed it was his mom's car as he could tell by the license plate.  So he spent the rest of the day trying to figure out why she was at school.  Everyone was saying it was cuz she was checking his grades but he knew that couldn't be plausible or feasible (last time he tried to say those words he mixed them and said flausible or pleasible or something).  6th period was fun except for the vocab quiz.  Tyke actually likes the student teacher they have in there.  For the past two weeks she has been cool.  When she teaches they don't really have to pay attention and they make jokes and she goes along with them so it is fun.  Basically Tyke gets to talk more than normal so he enjoys that.  But after school Tyke went out to Purdy's car to get his jacket back as she had been wearing it some and it smelled "like boy" but he wanted it back.  He ran the Turner move with Kinker and his sis so they got in the car and Tyke was fearful of not getting to back out of his spot like so many times he can't.  But there was Tina saving the day.  She let him back out and leave as she was coming to bball practice.  Then Amed came over and made sure that the bball plans were still on at his house after school.  They were.  So Tyke went home and changed quickly.  While writing his mom a note/calling her to tell her where he was going he noticed something odd all over the main floor.  Pictures of Tyke were everywhere.  Not that he minds, the vain ham that he is, but it was not a normal occurrence in the Turner household.  That, he realized, must have been the reason Tyke's mom was at school today.  Cuz she was doing Senior Slide Show or Senior picture stuff.  Cuz when he called her she said "she had some business to take care of there" as her excuse for being there.  But Tyke had no fears.  Instead he just went up to Amed's and played some bball with Macaroon, Skippy, Maniak, Fejj, and Doc P.  It was fun.  Tyke won 21 again.  He really loves being able to win.  It is great.  He just keeps taking it to the house.  Some weird black guy there told the gang that he couldn't get kicked off and if they tried to play a full-court game he was "in the first 10."  But he just randomly told them that.  Kinda freaky.  He was an imposing figure to Tyke.  Big and black.  Mainly big.  After most people had left, Tyke, Maniak, Amed, and Fejj all played against these 3 sophomores Tyke thinks.  Maniak knew them apparently but Tyke didn't.  The seniors just goofed around and had fun while the other kids actually tried.  It was stupid of them but they had to try and win.  They probably did but when Tyke just turns and throws the ball at the hoop he isn't trying to play.  And when they make everyone go to one side of the court, or the top of the key, or all in the key, or all outside the 3-point line, they aren't trying.  To sum up, Tyke went home after that and just kinda lazed around for a while.  Hasn't actually done any homework yet but he might before he goes to sleep.  Perhaps, not set yet.  Tyke isn't going to be playing the Sly Lioners on Friday cuz Purdy is supposedly going out with Ekul.  Pah!  Tyke should be going out with Ekul.  But not in a gay way.  In a basketball playing way where Kinker is there too.  Nope, that made it gayer.  Not gay though.  Straight stuff. Basketball.  Opposite of gay.  Not that there's anything wrong with that (repeat usage).
