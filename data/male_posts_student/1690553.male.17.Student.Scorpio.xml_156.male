Yesterday the timetable for Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics came out - each carry 5 contact hours so all together that's a good 15 hours of class added to my timetable. I'm placed in Group 27 - the first Engineering Group together with Adnan, which I've mentioned before as a fluent English spekaer. He speaks coolly like an English gentlemen while another fellow by the name of Amir Hanif speaks like those easy going Australians, complete with lots of hillarious jokes.  Also got the timetable for FKM (Fundamental Knowledge for Muslim) class timetable which is just 3 hours of class per week. The only missing part of my timetable now is computer class. The timetable is out, but there's no grouping information, so how could I attend the class?  The first class I attended this week is Chemistry. The lecturer is Madam Suzilawati Hamzah. Nothing much for except for the rough outline of the course, taaruf (getting to know each other), AND the date of Mid-Semester Examination which falls on 5th of August from 8am to 10am. Anyway, it's good to know the exam date.  Next is the Arabic Class at room S3011, which is pretty much one of the far flung corner of the campus. The class is from 5pm to 7pm, what a time to study language but then better than having night class. Fortunately, the teacher is an energetic one - Ustaz Hassan Hajjaj which came all the way from Egypt. Our seniors said that having Arabic class with foreigner could be hard but we don't see much problem. True enough, language would be a barrier as he speaks mostly Arabic interwined with English and Malay but because most of the people in my class have basic in Arabic, we already started conversing in Arabic with the ustaz in the very first hour of our lesson.   Speaking of basic in Arabic, the ustaz did ask us how many years we had studied Arabic before. Most answered three (PMR level) including myself while a few others had studied for 4  5 years. Only two of us had no basic at all. Then the ustaz said in mock disbelief, "You all had studied Arabic for 3, 4  5 years and you are still in this Elementary Arabic class? Masya-Allah~" We just replied with our sheepish grin.  The ustaz also have a good sense of humour, read on...  Ustaz: What is that in Arabic? (Pointing to a book).  Class: Kitab  Ustaz: OK, good. How do you say my book in Arabic?  Class: Kitabi.  Ustaz: Very good, what's that in Arabic? (Pointing to the door)  Class: Babun. (Some of us started giggling already)  Ustaz: How do you say my door in Arabic then?  Class: B*bi (The whole class broke into laughter).  Note: B*bi (babi) means pig in Malay.
