They just rip, distribute, rip, distribute- they are what is keeping the gaming industry to propel as rapidly as we thought it should- they dont have enough money because of these pricks! Now, I'm not talking about little puny games who's companies are extinct, even I do that, I'm talking about big name games like BF1942, Mafia, Max Payne, Enter The Matrix, and all the others. Just buy the freaking game like you're supposed to!  Oh, i know, "I don't have enough money" bullshit- you gotta work for it! LIKE I DO!!! I save up, i do my chores, i take out the trash, i mow the lawn, i dont bitch my parents around like my brother does, and look at me! Dan knows- he saw it! My whole freaking FLOOR is covered with game cds! That's why you don't rip. It's something to strive for. Can you show me a whole room full of game cd's? I didn't think so.    I was watching Greg Proops standup today, it's hillarious. He was talking about how we were lied to throughout our growin up about history. "Oh really, greg? Which ones?" All of them.  The pilgrims came to america to escape relimagious persecution in Europe!  Then he goes into song... "We lied about history because it *sounds* better and it *tastes* better than the trruuuuuuth.. so let's just pretend it really happened...."  I'll show you whizzut he did later- just not in large groups- im not into exhibitionism. :-O!!!  Well, in There yesterday, i beat this guy's ass at paintball. he was all like ":-O" when he fell over and the ragdoll effects(yes, it has em) took over, and I was all like "X-P." We were hoverboard fighting. It was oh so much fun!
