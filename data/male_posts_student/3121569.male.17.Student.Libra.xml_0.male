Hmmm, I don't really know 'bout the cause of the sleep disorder, could be a number of things. See, I've been and still am deprived of  normal  sleeping habit, maybe because I always want to do something ELSE instead of just sleep and let time pass by, maybe there's too much thought passing through my mind, or maybe I'm just still young and don't want to 'waste' my time on sleep... But when I do get into the state of sleep, I can stay in it for a fuckin' long time! :/ I guess it all depends on how you've accustomed you mind and body, changing that is a long process... and no, pills are never an answer, just try relaxing and feelin' good!
