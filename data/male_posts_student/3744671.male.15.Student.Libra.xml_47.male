There are no print copies left, but you can still get digital copies (what I'm doing) where you get an email telling you to download a program that will display your magazines. Then you download the magazine and it will be stored on your hard drive where you can view it whenever you want! They give you every single page too, including advertisements so you're not missing anything by going digital. Pretty simple, plus it's free so why not!   urlLink Subscribe Here!       ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
