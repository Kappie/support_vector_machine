Come on now anyone could have gotten stuck, how can anyone park in that angle?  Anyways, after many tries to get out and sitting there for a few minutes, we got out using mad geometry skillz. :p Maybe I shouldn't have laughed, but it was just so cute to see her that way, I couldn't help it. :(  Anyways, we parked up higher. Damn I should of taken pictures, and oh yea... not even a scratch. :p  Man I feel bad, might be why she wasn't talking to me. *sigh* This stuff is so complex, why can't I simply be a rock. Rocks have such a better time don't have to worry about shit... or maybe they do...but other wise they don't have much to worry about...  Well i'm becoming an addict and net gone morrow, gonna cry :(
