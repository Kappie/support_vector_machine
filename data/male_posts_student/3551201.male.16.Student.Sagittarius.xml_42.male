John Edwards of North Carolina, asked by columnist Robert D. Novak in…the American Spectator to recall any conservative position he’s taken in the U.S. Senate    Though an e-mail today, John Forbes Kerry picked up a smooth talking, good looking North Carolina Senator named John Edwards. The move was not suprising at all, as Kerry hopes Edwards' sex appeal and youth will buy him some votes (similarly to Clinton's VP choice in Al Gore). But when you look into Edwards' ideology, it is clearly disturbing.   Despite the attractiveness and youth, Edwards has no foreign policy experiance at all, is the 4th most liberal senator, and is a former trial lawyer that has put faulty evidence in his many cases which has won him hundreds of millions (many cases in which he blamed doctors for causing Cerebral Palsy). Edwards does not understand the world as it is, and believes that America is undertaxed. Even a Hillary/Kennedy ticket would be more conservative than a Kerry/Edwards ticket.  In this critical election and an everchanging world, American's should not look for a Vice President that will learn about National Security on the job.  Though many Conservatives and Republican's feared a Kerry/Edwards match, Edwards may hurt Kerry's campaign instead of helping Kerry. John Kerry got nothing of what he wanted in a Vice President (Kerry criticized Edwards for being young and inexperienced, once saying that he didn't know if Edwards was even "out of diapers" when Kerry returned from Vietnam).  Kerry was looking for a proven leader with sound judgement on National Security, economic prosperity and social justice, someone commiteed to Kerry's issues and vision for the country, compatible with Kerry on all levels, capable of inspiring confidence in voters from all parts of the country and all walks of life, and ready at any moment to assume the awesome responsibility of President. The reality is that Edwards has never made a judgment on a matter of national security in his life and is only in his first term as a U.S. senator. Edwards does not truely believe in Kerry's viewpoints because he ran against him (Kerry tossed some harsh words on Edwards and his limited experiance), Edwards could only inspire voters in his homestate and couldn't win his adopted state of North Carolina in the primaries.   If anything, Kerry desperately needed a balance and a compatable mate, but a choice of a flip flopping ultra liberal + ultra liberal populist is not the right formula for a "Better America".
