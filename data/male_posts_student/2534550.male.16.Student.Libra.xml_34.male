It seems that virtually anything would be a better name and wouldnt carry the negative connotation of being on the "b"squad.     I'm sorry, but I don't find anything offensive about being part of "just" the B "squad" Does "B" now stand for "bad" and the "A" in "A" Corps for "awesome"? Last I checked, there is not ONE singular negative connotation with that "B" added at the end of my corp's name. It simply states that yes, we are a different division of the Blue Devils organization. How about the "C" corps? Woo-ee, they must be SUPER bad, I mean, look at that, C is after B in the alphabet.   WTF dude, I wear the same jacket those super A Corps kids do, hey lookie, there goes a C Corps kid with the same exact jacket. Whenever someone asks me if I just aged out of BDA, or "hey, congratulations on your 11 time World Championship" I say, hey, thanks, but I had nothing to do with that. I proudly state that I am in fact a member of the B corps, a PERFECTLY VALID and competitive corps.   The name has nothing to do with it.    [/DCP rant_OFF]
