They were badly infected, looked horrible, and were in pain most of the time. But I feared getting them removed! One of my fears: mutilation of my body. Also combines with my fear of needles. Then one day, my cousin stomped my foot. Accident? I still say, "Yeah right! THAT HURT!" But it was the final straw, I broke down and accepted my fate. With the help of another, kind and caring, cousin I got a "off the books" operation on my poor little toes (actually it was the big toes and one little toe). I quaked in fear, agonized over the needles stabbing my toes. A set of two injections in each to numb them. Two toes took 2 sets, the last and worst toe took 3 sets and still didn't stop the massive pain. Once it was all done, I nearly past out (mainly due to my cousin, who was the nurse there, just HAD to show me the bloody nails). Then I had a strange laughing bout, I just started laughing and couldn't stop.  None the less, never let things gets so bad that it requires all that pain to put some sense into your head! Just get it over with, you'll appreciate it.
