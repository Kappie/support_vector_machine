Then, met Ji at 12 and went to school. At school, me, Ji, Manda and SL discussed aboutHistory lor. I taught them the War In The Pacific. Hmm...I have been doing this question all year, so if it comes out in the exam, I think I would do it.  Hmm...the History exam...sigh. It ended up being the same as the SS paper. Yes, Japan did came out. But they asked about attacking Pearl Harbor, which I didn't even learn. Sigh! I anyhow came out with explanations. I hope they can get through. One question, asking about reasons why Japan attacked China, I know how to answer. Ha! I had been answering that for ages. SBQ was a shocker. 3 pictorial sources! Oh my my. But it was kinda easy la. Come one lor. No motives to be inferred (they don't even provide you with provenanance), so the highest level is not the motive level. Kinda worrying, but the questions were easy. Sigh...everybody thinks we are gonna be toasted by this paper. There goes my A!!  Hmmm....me, Ji, SL and HuiMin went to Causeway Point to buy present for YiChun. First, we went to eat at the foodcourt. Hmmmmm.....very shocking. VERY VERY shocking. After that, we went to buy a prezzie lor. We brought a DIY photo frame, where she can mould and paint. I think she would like it, being an artistic person.  After that, came back and watched TV lor. Heh heh! The Holland V millionaire special is so fun to watch! So funny the cast! Heh!! After that, came online and chatted lor.  Charmed is so cool!! Piper delivered her baby ("If you are referring to Mr Winkie between the legs, yeah, it's a boy" Phoebe). O.o!! So cool! They used unicorn magic to vanquish the evil cats. What a cute baby boy!  Sigh. I am being forced to cut my hair after blogging. Why can't I lead my life the way I want?! WHY MUST THE SCHOOL/GOVERNMENT IMPOSE SUCH TERRIBLE RESTRICTIONS ON MY LIFE? When I am going to school, I am going there to be taught knowledge, NOT to have my life controlled by conservative idiots. Why can't males have long hair? What kind of rubbish-convention is this? Even in dynastic China, males have extremely long hair. Even in medievel ages, males have long hair too! Why and how did China men evolve from having long hair to keeping them short now? This is the new age, people! We are being controlled by the tight-rules of our supposedly-modern society. It pains me to be adhering to these idiotic, life-controlling 'rules'. Sigh..... I wish convention can be done away! Gone!! Then, we can live in a modern socirty, unbound by conservative laws. Sigh! If you think I am letting my hair cut without presenting a fight, then I say, you are sadly mistaken.  See ya tonight, blog! Bye!
