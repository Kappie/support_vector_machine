A new color scheme, plain and simple  2. Fewer and smaller frames, focusing the attention on the posts themselves  3. The "comment" feature, whereby you can comment on each post, like on a xanga, except you don't have to have an account or anything.  I recommend using the comment feature well, stating your first name only, with all the correct spellings, capitalizations, and grammatical rules.  I look forward to hearing from you.
