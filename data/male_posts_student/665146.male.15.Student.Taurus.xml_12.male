When something like this happens, it's not right to make fun of it.  But enough of stating the obvious, I'm not exactly sure what happened, so if you want more, I bet everyone else's blogs have information.  Anyway, for some reason, I have a feeling it was just someone who was playing off the fear of a possible terrorist attack.  But I can't dwell on the sad.  Life goes on...  Anyway, today was a good day for me.  I saw Minority Report.  I just want to say that this is the best damn movie I have seen in a looooooong time.  This movie will easily rival The Matrix.  The only thing that's messed up is the fact that all this takes place in 2054, besides that, this is a god-like movie and I'm sorry I made fun of its name.  Go America......Today, I'm not kidding.
