I didn't really want to make a blog. But tonight, I was surfing the Internet, looking at the Chris Derby/Dan Holbrook plagarism thing, and I found out that Chris Derby had called me an "ass muncher." You know who warned him to take off the stuff that he blatantly ripped off Dan Holbrook (and he did, everyone could see it before he deleted it)? Me. You know who defended him when everyone else called him an arrogant prick who thinks he is better than everyone? Me. And he goes and calls me an "ass muncher" behind my back. But I digress. This whole thing got me to thinking about the Internet. It used to be me who insulted people behind their backs from the safety of a computer monitor. Did I grow up, or am I just behind the times? I know I didn't grow up so it must be the latter. Anyway, here we are. I don't see myself pondering anything deep or meaningful here. That's not what the Internet is for. It's for calling people who defended you "ass munchers."
