Dunnot ask me for what E stands for as it is not good to say it.  He, so smartly, brought my mini cd home, as i had asked him to help me burn Gunbound and Kazaa Lite, and so smartly listened to the songs in it, and without bothering to erase the files, started some crap burning. He was so smart to burn when he didnt even erase. So Smart.  Then, he took his own initiative to use one of his own CDs, and so smartly and supposedly burnt the installation files into it. The next day, he handed both disks over to me. Today, after i just took a look at what he had SUPPOSEDLY burnt in them, i saw to my dismay, my cd practically untouched, and his cd used, as it indicated no more free space, and no files in it. SO SMART...  Just looking at him will make my life shorter....
