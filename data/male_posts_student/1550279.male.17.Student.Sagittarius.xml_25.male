This time, it's 1 DDR Party, 2 FFXI Websites, and 3 Extremely Good Movies.   1 DDR Party:  Tuesday night Sam had a DDR party over at his house. While only a few of us actually had prior experience playing, it was fun, and a bunch of people made the comment that they wanted to go out and buy it. It did strike me as being a little humorous when people aske me if this was just a normal DVD. Not sure how you would connect the pads then...   2 FFXI Websites:  The site I am designing for my FFXI clan finally went online on its new paid hosting, and I have also been recruited as the lead person for the FFXI division of another website. Not exactly what I would call the best timing to have both of these come up together, but it'll at least keep me busy for a while.   3 Extremely Good Movies:  I saw 3 movies this week:  I, Robot ,  The Bourne Supremacy , and  Catwoman . I liked all of these movies a whole lot, and definitely recommend that anyone reading this should go see them.  I, Robot  was a very entertaining cdi-fi/mystery movie,  The Bourne Supremacy  was an extremely good sequel (although I suggest seeing  The Bourne Identity  first), and  Catwoman  rivals  Spiderman 2  as being one of the best superhero(ine) movies I've ever seen.  Going along with the number 3, that's how many people called my house within 45 minutes wanting an answer to the exact same question. Not a whole lot of cross-communication going on there...
