I rode Alison's bus to her house and hung out with her Emily and Crystal for a while, Crystal bought me some more smokes :). I skated to Sherman's house because he wanted to skate, but wasn't there [ya fuggin' asshole!] and then went to Morgan's for a while, but left so she could shower and I could go skate with Jarred. We skated to the corner store, and saw Tessa... [my ex-bestfriend] it's so fucking depressing to see her, because we used to be bestfriends and I used to be completely head-over heels for her... :/. I could barely stand being there, but for some reason I wanted to stay. I played three games of skate yesterday, and won all of them... tricks included were: kickflip, heelflip, kickflip over a gutter, fakieflip, varial-flip, 360 nollie shovit, nollie big spin, some gaps, and other stuff... normal game, you know? Jarred and I hung out at Ali and Emily's house for a while, and Emily, Adam, Alison, Jarred, Tessa, Adam [different one], and Justin and myself were there, it was fun but it could've been better... Jarred's kingpin [if you don't skate, don't ask] broke off of his front truck [Venture trucks] and he had to ride a bike to my house. And now, back to the present, today: I had school off but it was a waste of time anyways, Jarred slept over and left an hour after we woke up because my dad made me cut and weedwack the front and back lawn, then sort literally 1000's [at least two thousand] of nails and screws and shit, I'm trying to sleep over Richie's so I can see Cassandra! I miss her so much :/ I can't get a hold of Richie... but I have to go do more chores [move 200+ pieces of firewood inside... GAY], love, me :). Later.  P.S. Fuck you for throwing me off that roof... you know who you are :)
