Well,actually I was too engrossed playing Black  White(God sim/RPG) on my PC.I'm addicted to the comp again.Anyone out there who'd volunteer to keep my mouseball for me?  Last Wednesday , got into some trouble with the DM and the physics teacher KP.It started out in quite a harmless manner.Classmates and I went out of school for lunch before our physics remedial and got back 10 minutes late cos we missed the bus and we were too lazy to walk back to school(which would take 10mins).Then we had the DM threaten to boot us out of this school which is totally shit.Now we have to see the DM every morning,reccess and lunchbreak which means I can't sleep in class during the mornings or watch the other kids play the piano(albeit out of tune is still a pleasure) during recess.  Then Friday come.... Went to watch the school concert band perform at the singapore  conference  hall,you know,pple keep mistaking it for singapore  convention  hall @ suntec.Then I met katie(neighbour) and KX,who shot me a number of dirty looks,well,actually I initiated the meeting cos I wanted a lift home from kt later. The Junior band had out of tune trumpets but the Main band was cool,QS was one of two guys who were playing the bassoon.Halfway into the concert I had this KX send me an sms that goes "U SUX!".Well,I'm not sure if she got any pleasure at the end of our non-verbal exchange cos...the last sms she sent me reads something like..."fuck you cheebye,lanjiao,xia lan,#$@%%^*^!@#!@#@#$*O*(%^$%...."Heck,girls are as tough as guys nowadays,they got about as much testosterone than guys.Then in her dad's car,katie kept apologising for KX's messages which was totally ridiculous cos shes the one who gave her my number.Couple of messed up people.  Spent most of last saturday playing black  white then went out for dinner @ Zhen Fa Huo Haixian(ZhenFa live seafood) to celebrate my mothers birthday where I got stuck in a toilet  cubicle  cos the doorknob came off.  You know?Theres been lots of talk in and out and about CLASS in Singapore.You know what I think?The only real class distinction in Singapore is between the scholarly straight A types ,the neither here nor theres and your flunkers or retainers.Brains are sexy.Then money is next.  Finally,heres to the over zealous christian people I care about ,  Your mission is to propagate your faith not only to your friends and family but to bring it across 7 seas ,the fields of cathay and over africa on the wings of youth.But my mid-term aspiration is to show and prove to you,yes,only you that everything is not god's will.And to show you the  small headiness of religion  ,that the chasing of god is after all a chasing after the wind.Nothing is more important than truth,kindness and beauty.These can exist without gods.These are the only things that matter.  au revoir.
