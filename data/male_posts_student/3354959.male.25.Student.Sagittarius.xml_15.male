Suggestions welcome (Leavy, this means you...you're great at this sort of thing).  Anyway, another ultimate frisbee match tonight. We had 1 win and 2 losses coming into the game, but of course I wasn't there for the only win, so I was hungry. Hungry, I tell you. I could smell it. I could feel a win.   Without going into too much detail, we prevailed, 13-11. I caught a few points in the end zone, including the final 2 to give us the win, so that felt pretty good. And on the drive home, for some reason my mind was wandering and I started wondering if any good movies have been made with ultimate as the subject, or at least playing a major role. I could think of none. It's featured in  PCU , the movie that very effectively satirizes almost every aspect of liberal arts colleges (I swear those guys must have gone to Oberlin), but not much else comes to mind.   I open up the floor: Any movies, documentary or otherwise, that feature ultimate frisbee in any meaningful manner? I await your responses.
