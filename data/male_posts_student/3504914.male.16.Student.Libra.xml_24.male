He doesn’t believe in syllogism, or synthesis, or any absolute.”  “What does he believe in?”  “Chaos. And you don’t even have to believe in it. It’s self-evident.”  From the book  Hannibal , by Thomas Harris    Question of the Day : Why is it that if you get a woman you’re said to have “nailed” her? A nail is a noun, and is the object which you are trying to bring into the wall. When something is nailed, it means to be already inside the wall. Would it not be better to consider the term “hammered”? I think everybody should start going, “Ah, I hammered this chick last night, smooth deal that.”   Rambles : Today sucked more balls than a hooker addicted to crack. The art exhibition went horridly, for it was a seemingly never-ending flood of kids, then a short calm, and then another flood came. Then there was nothing but boredom. I did however get further in my reading of Hannibal, so that’s alright. Then when we were packing up, I helped carry out the plants, and ended up receiving friction marks on both my arms. Doesn’t hurt, but it really takes the piss all the same. Then I helped fixed a red-eye problem in a picture for a friend, and then I went home. And now I’m here. Whoopity-doo for you, yes?    Topic : Feminist Nazis   Wonderful image that creates in your head eh? A woman with hairy armpits wearing a sleeveless shirt extending her arm and shouting “Heil Female!”. Don’t get me wrong, feminists kind of have a good reason to hate us men, I mean we DID oppress them for centuries upon centuries. But when a woman dares demand they receive equal rights and yet play the “I’m a woman” card when they like, I say they can go fuck themselves. THEY CAN GO FUCK THEMSELVES.  Let’s picture this. A woman demands a job, she’s put with the rest of them in the line, and if she’s skilled enough, she gets in. If she’s not? Oh, its obviously female oppression in the work place. SUED. What a load of bullshit. The same goes for racial equality. People should not get jobs for their skin colour, but for their ability in the workplace. Would you rather have a woman doctor who knows fuck all, or a male doctor who knows what he’s doing? The answer is obvious, unless you’re a blind ignoramus. In the case of the latter, you should go fuck yourself and leave this blog RIGHT now.    End Note : Maybe I’ll add more to this argument later. Maybe not. Probably not. Ah, I won’t. I’m a lazy retard xD
