Anyways I decided to go onto this ACN place and like, start posting, but amazingly (suprise suprise) some ass was posting irrelevant crap on the boards.  So I'll probably never post there again.  But then I don't know.  I'm confuzed now.  Okay anyways, so let me tell you whats going on in my life right now.  My friend's computer is possesed.  It's making random sounds in the middle of the night, from screaming to mooing.  And I have more work from the wonderful world of the OCDE, thank you for not slowing me down at all and keep me doing homework for the rest of my life.  Obviously nothing really bigs going on.  My friend went to Ohio, my other friend is at KBF right now, and I'm sitting on my ass.  Well it's time for me to go, gotta exercise the demons out of my friend's computer.  Ta.
