I was thinking about if I were just to drop dead, or something, who would care?  I realized everyone I know well would.  The people behind me right now, they probably wouldn't (I'm in Web Page).    Life is fucked up.  These thoughts pass. Or, at least I hope.  Yeah I'm sorry, I can be such a dick.  Heh, you wanted to see my dark side, there you go.  Its a jerkface/self centered ass.  I didn't really mean all my 'fuck you's'.  It just its been a little while since I had felt like that.
