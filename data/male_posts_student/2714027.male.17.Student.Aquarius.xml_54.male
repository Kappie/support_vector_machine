It's so much nicer to work on days like these when half your time is spent outdooors.  Yesterday I was determined to do revision, but ended up spending the morning doing not a lot, then doing a couple of hours Mechanics revision in the afternoon. I have the exam for it on Monday, so really must get down to working on it on Sunday. I've already turned down working that day, so I better make use of it. Last night we (parents and I) went round to a friend's house for dinner, which was okay to begin with because I was the only one there under 40, then turned out alright when her daughter returned home from babysitting. I've known her for ages, but hardly ever see her, so we chatted for ages about our old school, the future, TV and crap like that.  Well I must be off, there's money to be earnt that I can save for my gap year. I just can't wait until one year and one month's time; a year long holiday in Australasia!
