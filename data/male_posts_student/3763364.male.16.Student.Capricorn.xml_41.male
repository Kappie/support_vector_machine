So I'm reading the diary of a certain green-party member, and it occured to me that my opinion of the green party was incredibly skewed. This man was an intellectual, down to earth guy. Hell, he would be one of the few politicians that have actually graduated from high school, let alone college! Usually when somebody brings up the green party, I think about a bunch of hippies parading around, yelling "Save the whales," "Legalize the pot, man!" Well, there's a stereotype for ya. This party could do a good job or running our "fine" country, promoting stable economical and social growth, rather than the "bang for the buck" type of system current politicians have going. They're more than a bunch of power-hungry, money-ravaging dickheads, and that is what sets them apart from most of the other parties. They don't want what's best for them, they want what's best for CANADA. I for one, vote green. Hell, anything's better than Liberal or Conservative...*Shivers*  And not to mention he's drop dead GORGEOUS.  Heres to not keeping secrets! *Drinks sparkling apple juice, pretending it's champagne*
