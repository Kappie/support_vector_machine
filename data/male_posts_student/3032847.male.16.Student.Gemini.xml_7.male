Combine the fact that I was up EARLY because at 8:00 the cavity wall insulation men started drilling INTO MY HEAD, so I did not miss the day! Having a coal fire heated house (no gas, cable TV, or broadband here)! we had the benefits of a government grant discount of 70% on making our house energy efficient.   I opened a new bank account, I bought some trainers, I lazed quietly at home and was kindly treat to a night in Pizza Hut (ok, not too glamerous but very kind seen as it was HIS birthday)! Cheers Fother.  After that we all went into ASDA and- as me and Dan were looking 'round trying to find everyone, we walked past this man with shorts on pushing a trolley. I remember thinking 'What's he looking so happy about'.. I thought it might be the fact that me and Dan were laffin- cheerin him up- but as he walked past he really farted- quite loud and disturbingly voilently, I'm sure something was trying to escape! Me and Dan looked at each other and I started laffin. 'Ya meph' he said. He thought it was me.  I noticed that the man had a lot of vegetables as I spotted him at the till... and also, another rant here, I told the bus driver on the way home '55p to top of (where I live), it's erm (the other name for the place where I live), he asked me how old I was, I said 15, he said well thats a pound please. Â£1? It's fucking 55 pence you fucking tard! And before that I'd always paid 50p, before getting bollocked of this other gimpy old git who swore that because I live in (this certain place)about 10 metres further, it was DEFINATELY FIVE PENCE MORE! Dick head. I didn't hang around to argue, 1: because I'm actually 16 and that was the price I SHOULD pay, if I hadn't said I was 15, and 2: the bus was full of chores and these people from (this other place, I'm not leading anyone to where I live here!) lets just say you shouldn't mess with those people. And there was a que behind me. And the bus was in the middle of the road.  Tomoz me and me mam are going on a digital camera hunt, for me dad, for his birthday and fathers day! (Different days but close enough). My 'exceedingly rich' great uncle is donating an unwanted shed to us, too. But he sold his practically new mercedes to some other bloke, without consulting us. And we have to come and take the shed to bits ourselves. Damn. Me mams cars fine (although it's a ford, I don't like fords, but it's mechanically sound) but our awld vauxhall vectra is getting on a bit now, the central locking don't work.. the alarm don't work.. the radio's shot to hell and the dashboard display, it rattles everywhere, the roof leaks (well, not no more- thanks to window, kitchen and bath sealant)! and engine bits and bobs are really starting to feel the effect of round the clock miles and insane thrashing.  It's just hit me that this time next week I'll have no exams left. I'll be totally free and out on my own, if you know what I mean. School is then TOTALLY over. It's kind of strange, I've been going there for the past 5 years! And now well, thats it. It's all over. I've got to know some good mates over the time, but GET IN!  Well. Song of the day: Come on England! (Variation of Dexy's midnight runners- Come on Eileen! from the 80's) I tell ya, euro 2004 fevers really gripped everyone! Sound of day: Man in shorts with the vege, farting as he walked past. Sight of day: This drunk man trying to walk straight, in the town centre. It was only 10:00 aswell. The shame, oh the shame. Food of the day: just has to be this 75g of 'snack works top of the roast pork crackling- seasoned pork rinds', ooh they were ultimately lush. Just the right crunchyness and flavour. The right fat consistency- and a bit of meat left on each and every crackley bit. There was even that greasy resin left on the inside of the packet, that you lick out when nobodys looking (or, in most cases, when they are).  This blog comes up as listing number 2 on google if you type monkeyhanger in. All-be-it with the old description in the caption, but whoa. 2 weeks and im right up there with the likes of the Alternative Guide to Hartlepool!
