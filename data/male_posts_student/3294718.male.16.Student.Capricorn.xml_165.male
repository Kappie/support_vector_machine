Actually, I think there were more people that turned their backs on us/flipped us off/said something negative to us then there were people who actually supported us. The majority of people kept their opinions to themselves though.   After that we went to sit on the hill and wait... The best part of the wait was when some people were going to sit in front of us and Airick just says, "III'mm rrriich." The people just looked at Airick and walked away. Finally, after hours of waiting, the fireworks started. They were the best fireworks I have ever seen in Brainerd. We also got to watch huge chunks of burning ash slam into people. That was pretty funny.
