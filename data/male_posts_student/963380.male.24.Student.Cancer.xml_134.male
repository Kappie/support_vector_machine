Sleeping in comes with several companion facets - (Farah Facets, I like to call them) that simply do not Snickers-Level Satisfy. Primarily, it means I stayed up late. This is true and completely accurate - there was conversing into the wee hours as  I watched some of the best episodes of the Sopranos I have ever had the chance to lay my poor, unworthy occularies upon. While staying up was great - I always feel bad when I don't accomplish something while staying up; no extra coding was finished, no new pages were added to any website, no language was learned, etc... I tried to absorb some of the basics about real photography, however, photo.net/learn takes me to a plethora of pages with poor parsing - nothing between it's head tag and it;s tail if you will. Pity.  Sleep has been an interesting exercise over the past few days. I purchased down pillows from Ikea - they are simply the greatest thing to happen to my nightly retreat from consciousness since the first time I found staying awake was not an optional thing. I also invested in a comforter at the time - something I've never in my life owned up until this point. Bedspreads were always the rule, with blankets. Let me say that the fine North American invention of the comforter probably prevented a war at some point, it's a god damn life saver. However, it promotes the most dangerous type of sleep. The "Aww fuck it, it's only X o'clock"- Rollover(tm). Really a dangerous thing for those wanting to get work done.  It's not often I'm in bed til 12. It's superduper rare. I've had my day (I'm not going to get anything done today as I have to get cleaned up and go to work, but at least I had a good nap. Dreams were weird (no dreams about out future prime minister again, that was *whack* - to coin a term).  So now all of today's morning appointments, (one really - to set up a computer, that's all I do), are being shifted to tomorrow.  One thing that's on the roster for today: More Glen-asskicking. MWAHA!  He's really not that bad.  Oh yes. Yes he is. Someday I'm gonna get all survivor style and "If you WAS lyin in the DESURT with no FOOD or WATA, I wouldn't even stop to give you a DRINK."  Mostly cause I've got to have someone to loathe, and congrats Glenner, you're it :) LOVE YOU!
