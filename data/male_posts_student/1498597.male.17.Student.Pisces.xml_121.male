But the only reason that I think bloggin' on the  T.E.W.  has almost come to a halt is that there is nothin' out there to talk about!  Or there is, but people just can't or don't want to (or both) take time outta their day to blog!  Of course, if I was actually a person who balances their time well, this statement would have had much more meanin', but unfortunately, I'm not a very punctual sorta person.  I guess I see what the problem is though...so how the hell do we fix it?  I dunno...yet.
