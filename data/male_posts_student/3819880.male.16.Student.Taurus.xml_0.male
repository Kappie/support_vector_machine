(179) 1 - Lifeline (FH) 2 - CPU Diagnostics (T190) 3 - AP English 3 (361) 4 - Japanese 3 (344) 5 - Lunch 6 - AP Chemistry (162) 7 - AP Chemistry (164) [ Tuesdays and Thursdays] 8 - AP Calculus BC (T290) 9 - AP US History (354)  Wow, my transcript is gonna look awesome.  I'm also going to die, but that isn't as important.  My mornings are pretty easy, so I can sleep in quite a lot and not miss anything.  That makes me happy.  On the other hand, my afternoons are suicide.  Whatever, I'll deal with it.  At the moment, I have no classes with Sarah, no classes with Ilana, gym and lunch with Alexa, and because Adrienne's schedule is fucked up I don't know if I have any classes with her (aside from Japanese).  I'm bored.  - Brian
