What I miss most about the Philippines are the friendships I've made and the ambience of simply being in the Philippines. *sigh* And all that food... Well at least I didn't eat any balut although to be a polite guest I ate some bitter melon... :P  Hmmm... Well Nikki and I had a good flight back. We were separatedwhen the flight began because of the seating arrangements but we talked to a few of the people who were sitting in the same row as us and asked them if they would be interested in switching seats so we managed to sit together for the whole flight back which I enjoyed and made the trip more bearable having one of my kapatid with me.  One question that came up was when we both knew we were Filipino. For me it happened when I was in grade school (maybe 2nd grade). As most everyone who knows me knows I don't really look Filipino. I'm mestizo but I could really pass for a full-blooded latino. Anyways, when I was in grade school, one of the teachers volunteered me to dance some Mexican fiesta dances. I had told her that 'ma'am, I'm not Mexican I'm Filipino.'  She simply replied, 'don't worry you look Mexican to me.'  My earliest memory was when I was 2 years old and ironically was of me leaving the Philippines. I thought about this same memory when I was leaving the Philippines this time around. Anyways, I remember sitting and that the chair tray was down and my mom had poured some plastic toys on the tray for me to play with during the flight.
