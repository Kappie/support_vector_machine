Its probably gonna turn out like shit, because Im uber-lazy and highly doubt that Ill actually take time to update all that often. But yeah...Im 17 and from Kalamazoo, Michigan. Hmmm...what else? Im about to be a Senior at K-Central. Im semi-metrosexual (errr...Pseudo-Suburban-Metrosexual) but go more preppy than anything else. I run. A lot. Im sure theres more to say, but no one wants to keep reading this anyways, so Im just gonna shutup. So there ya go...my first post. Pretty deep, huh?
