Would be a lot better if it wasnt pissing down outside but it reminds me of home (aaaaaaahhhhh) so it aint all bad.  Madrid was ace, Steffen trying to pull most things Spanish that moved (jokes!) and only a few bombs went off in the vicinity so generally safe!  Did our fair share of sightseeing, got the Prado and Royal Palace and did the whole tourist thing with the audio guided tour, had to be done.  Sat on top of the tourist bus (the one you used to point at in Barca and say "what a bunch of coños") with headphones on and map out, the pictures, when they get put up, will be great!  Eventually got to the Bernabéu on the other side of town which was damn impressive and certainly gives the Nou Camp a run for its money (by the way has anyone seen the new Nike advert with Brazil vs Portugal, really cool and filmed in the Nou Camp!).  Being back home was nice but a real whirlwind trip, being back for 6 days is never enough time to see everyone and do everything but it all kinda got fitted in somehow, even managed to work a day back at the old Phone House, my last day was far more boring than it was emotional!  Had a couple of big nights out, you guys have not had a large one unless you have been to Oceana in Kingston, as Constance would say, y'all gotta come and visit!  Went down to a friend's boat on the Friday and got smashed off our faces which involved stealing things from the local pub and trying not to fall off the boat!  Managed to survive however and had a nice family din dins on the last night to celebrate various bdays (Ma and Pa have theirs on the same day which makes for an expensive time of things, just found out I have an exam on the very day :o( )  I did manage to get a new charger for my camera which was what was wrong, I think Edgar tried to eat my old one so it is now back in action.  Again, time on this damned infernal blasted money grabbing extortionate piece of shite internet cafe computer is gonna run out so,  be good boys and girls, one love,  A
