But, since then I would say the I have been completely amotivational. I don't even have the energy to be stumbern with my wife.  We are going to go out in a few minutes to see the new Harry Potter film. Going to the cinema and out to eat are about the only two things left that we seem able to do with each other without a fighting. We use to do so much together. For Christ's sake we use to even ride a tandem bike all over the place. But, now we don't even have conversations. That is unless you count her hen pecking. It drives me nuts. I just wish she would stop being a bitch. This shit has been going on for about three months now. And, I can't take anymore of this crap.
