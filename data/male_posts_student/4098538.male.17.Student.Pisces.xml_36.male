We were talking about night clubs and college and other crap. She got off and went to Urbis and I went to meet Gav at Burger King. We started walking to Urbis and there we stopped to listen to this guy stood near HMV playin' reggae... he was so cool. I bumped into Jenny and Ellin and spoke to them about their photo shoot with the weird perve guy! Then we carried on walkin' and there was this tribal drumming band who were amazing. They should so combine their skills! Then we got to Urbis and started drinking and skating (attempted skating anyway). There were loads of security dudes walking about so we decided to get McDonalds cups and pour the beer into them (clever)! But we still got caught. Some dumbass made us throw them away! Then some people walked past shouting 'slow chemical' at me. Aw wow, I'm famous! Then Mandy called (wooooo!) and I bumped into my cousin Dave again. Things got pretty boring from here. We just walked about, setting newspapers on fire, got some food and went to the bus stop. I saw my friend Sarah and her boyfriend there and they told me they were attacked with a Coca-Cola can! Bit gutted! They went to see Passion Of The Christ and it made her cry apparently! Then my bus come and I got on and some weirdo guy started talking to me about magic. I think he really WAS insane. He told me he taught David Blaine everything he knows  'and more'. Rrrrrriiiiiggghhhhhhtttt! Anyway, for some reason my back is hurting so I'm gonna go now.
