I can easily stand behind the idea that June 6, 1944 was the single most important day in the 20th century, and the outcome was far from certain.  While many may argue that Nazi Germany couldn’t possibly hold out against the combined might of the Allies, imagine what would have happened if this assault had failed?  Imagine fifty thousand dead, with a follow up invasion put off by another year, or even two.  Imagine the possibility that an exhausted England could have lost the will to fight, and would have given Hitler the peace he so wanted in the west.  Or imagine an America that lost interest during the delay, and decided that if England wanted peace, then perhaps America should pay more attention to the Pacific.  The days after June 6th were far from certain.  In light of the troubles we face today, it is difficult to imagine any current generation meeting this challenge the way they did back then.  While the 1940s generation made a decision over what was worth dying for, the current generations have a hard enough time figuring out what to live for.  These men (and women) accepted the situation and went out and got the job done in ways that still brings tears to my eyes.  I see these veterans on TV and I get emotional, knowing that all the adulation and praise being heaped at their feet on the part of the media is mostly phony.  Yeah, phony.  We praise their sacrifice and bravery while at the same time allowing our own children to fail learning the lessons they teach.  Children come out of school understanding that the American’s interred Japanese-Americans in camps, but they don’t recognize the name Iwo Jima or Tarawa.  They can’t name the date of the Normandy Invasion, but they understand that we dropped nuclear bombs on Japan when ‘the war was all but over’.  If we really honored the men of WW II, we would fix this.  I for one plan on making my kids sick with information about these men, and if they don’t also tear up when they see the graveyards in France, then I have failed as a parent.  Watching the D-Day clips on TV, I think about the rangers at Pointe du Hoc (climbing a 100 ft cliff in broad daylight while the Germans stood up on top and shot down at them), or Major Howard’s Englishmen at Pegasus Bridge, seizing a vital crossroads in a night glider landing in the early morning hours, or of St Mere-Eligse and the Airborne soldier hanging on the steeple, helpless as the Germans gunned him down.  I think about the miracle of the FUSAG deception, using the name of Patton to freeze two Panzer divisions at Calais, buying valuable time for the beachhead to gain a hold on the thin sliver of bloody sand.  And I think about the individual soldiers, nineteen years old, dropping from the sky or wading through five feet of water in a hail of gunfire, knowing only that this was probably his last moment on earth, yet filled with a resolve not to let his buddies down.    Where do such men come from?  They spring from a free society, but I’m not sure we’re making them anymore.
