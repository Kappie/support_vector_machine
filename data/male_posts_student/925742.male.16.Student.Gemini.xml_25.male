Osage Beach.  Caught 8 fish.  Their nerves make them squirm even after you take their heads off.  I laughed my ass off.   I bought Icewind Dale 2.  I didn't play the first, I was busy with BG2.  You don't need to play the first, it comes a few years later and has a different plot.  I like the feature of creating a party.  Thats nice.  I like 3rd ed. AD  Graphics are kinda antiquated, but , hey, it reminds me of BG2.  Soooo... yeah.  Nothing much else. Makin' movies, makin' songs, and foitin' round the woerld!!
