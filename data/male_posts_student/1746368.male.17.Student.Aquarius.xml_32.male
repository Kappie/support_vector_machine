I downloaded the Google toolbar, and now whenever I have just visited a site that I think is totally awesome and you guys should all see, all I do is click this little button, and a window pops up with a post information for my journal. You guys probably aren't as excited as I am, but it helps me a lot. Well, that's all I wanted to tell you. Remember, no matter how hard you try, you can't lick your own ear.   *EDIT*  Well, my mom and I just got my shelf up. Now I have extra room. The problem is I've grown so accustomed not to having a shelf, that all I have up there are my GBA (Game Boy Advance) games, some change and a movie that isn't mine. I assume that eventually some of my books will go up there. I will probably put things that I don't have room for down here next to my computer.   Well, I am extremly bored right now. I am done moving things around my room (for the most part). I probably will clean my room; yea I'm weird, I like cleaning my room. I do it without anybody asking me too. If my room is messy I can't ever find anything. Have a great day everyone. Remember, if life gives you lemons, throw the lemons back at it; you don't know where they've been.
