A quick thought on the show Cops;  isn't it aaaaawesome?  ^_^ Don't get me wrong, I dislike *, but so do the cops on the show, and if you can't see that you're missing the point of filming the great duty of busting *.  I've seen  Bowling for Columbine  and yes, there is too much violence on TV, but pinning a guy down and sending him to jail, and then listening to a cop explain the technical components of his lunch break is insignificant when compared to the exploding heads in Dawn of the Dead, or something along those lines.   Which reminds me, Maddox is a doodie sometimes.   Anyways I'm watching Cops right now, and a squad car just got a flat tire  on  some train tracks.  Why were they there?  Some nut job dirt biker was shooting down the tracks.  What could make this better?  A train's coming.  So these cops are wiggin' out trying to get it off the tracks, and then the train takes a left on these other tracks; the train's original route.  Funny?  It happens twice in a row.  Could this be better?  Nope, the cop who got his car stuck has a lisp.  I agree, Charlton Heston is a dink, but I think Cops is one of the greatest low-budget shows out there.   * Drug dealers, 'thugs', addicts, criminals, anyone over 200 lbs., anyone with an I.Q. under 100, any man with a tattoo anywhere below the belt, anyone with over 20 piercings, those 'goths' with black nails and clothes, 'thugs', anyone who has bling, anyone over the age of 30 missing 2+ teeth, and anyone who loved Hellboy, 'thugs', idiots who stand in circles free styling, and Brad Taylor, the world's largest animate boulder.
