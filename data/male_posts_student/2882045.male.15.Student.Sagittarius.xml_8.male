So today is Monday and we're out of school for Presidents' Day WOOHOO. But then again, because of the fact that my life is pitiful and boring as hell, I'll probably be on my ass all day while my peers go out and have fun. Well I guess it's better that I stay home then go out and do something stupid, only to regret it the next day. This Sucks.
