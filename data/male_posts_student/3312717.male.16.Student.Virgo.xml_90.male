I'm going to have to go to bed in like two hours and drink black coffee tomorrow.  I think best after midnight, and it makes me mad that I have to blog before my ideas start to flow.  But hey, I do get paid tomorrow. I'm thinking of saving for either a CD deck or a digital camera, and I think I'll go with the camera. It'll also be a nice experiment in self-control to see if I can go three weeks without spending all of my money. I want to get one of those cameras that automatically load your pictures onto the computer when you put it in the cradle. My grandma has one and it is really cool.  Nothing really went down today. I only left my house once, to take out the garbage. It is a shame, because it was so nice out, but I didn't feel like calling someone and then spending three hours trying to find something to do.  I thought about rearranging my room again. I moved some stuff around to make it seem more open, but it still seems cluttered to me. I modernized it, and took out most of the stuff I don't use, but it still feels disarrayed to me. When I first moved in, I took a minimalist approach to it, but now I have shelves and desks and chairs and bookcases everywhere and there is no open space.  In other news, I've got more CDs now than my three cases can hold and eight or so are laying around my floor. I'll probably one huge one to hold all of them together.  A couple random things off  urlLink Yahoo! News :   urlLink Supreme Court allows 'Under God' on Technicality : Come on, guys (and girls). Stop forcing your conservative views on us. It is clearly unconstitutional to have it in there, as is making us actually say the pledge in school. It is the same deal with "In God We Trust" on money. That doesn't represent all Americans, as a lot of them clearly  don't  trust in the Christian God the money refers to. Also, to sidestep the issue by dismissing it on a technicality is cowardly.   urlLink 2003 Report discloses Senator's Wealth  What happened to representative government? Why do people keep electing senators who might have other than their constituents interests in mind? Obviously a millionaire has a different idea of what is good for the people than a working class person.  Tomorrow, I'm going to buy some gas for the wagon, and a copy of the new  Spin . I don't exactly enjoy listening to the majority of the bands in  Spin , as they normally only cover the current darlings of the music world, be it the Strokes, the White Stripes, Outkast, Death Cab for Cutie, or Franz Ferdinand.  The emo-rap revolution has started. Yes, I am talking about the abomination that calls itself Atmosphere. Even though Erik pretends to enjoy it, he probably was just turned on to it by his girlfriend and pretends to like it.  I've been thinking about what the hipsters are going to jump on during the next school year. I hope it is indie, so I won't have to hear about how great emo is anymore and the "punks" such as Rozy's gang will get off my beloved punk, but I had a thought the other day that ska is poised to explode. I've already heard of bands like Friendly C referencing it at their shows, although I didn't witness it myself, and I can't really remember a time when people were into it. Most of the so-called ska fans at our school listen to borderline ska such as Suicide Machines, or reggae-skaish music like Sublime. It isn't a hostile scene to get into, and I can see people listening to some LTJ and proclaming that they are "Rudies." I enjoy ska but I but I prefer bands that mix sounds, like I said yesterday. Pop-ska fans would seem like the worst sort of blasphemy to Chris, because he jealously guards it as one of the few untainted scenes.   Ehh, not much to write about today. I'm not sure how much longer I can go on.   In fact, I think I am done now. I've got stuff to do before I sleep.
