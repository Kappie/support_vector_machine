Ok, joking, im not, but i guess u guessed i am not, but yes, there is some good/bad news. In 6 weeks (3 September) i am going to Bali. I am not joking this time. I am gonna be closer to u!!! lol but any way i dont know if i can do chat or the net there or wateva, but i will send u a post card, i will need a forwarding address from u so i know where to send it. and i think this is great we can blog away to each other. bloggyness...lol cya, Ren√©e :-* PS, im guessing u got the e-mail from malcolm aswell, at least now we know he is still ALIVE!!!
