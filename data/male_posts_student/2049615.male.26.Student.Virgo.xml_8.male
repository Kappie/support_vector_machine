Of course there are many reasons:  It's gross, it causes cancer, it's expensive, all that money goes straight to Pat Robertson, and Ian MacKaye would be disappointed in me.  None of these are my reasons.  I don't smoke because in 1995 a particularly attractive girl I knew told me that my cigarette smoking was the only impediment to our having, and this is an  exact  quote, "a torrid sexual liaison".  I'm fairly certain that this comment did not constitute a standing offer.  I completely lost touch with her two years ago and I think I can be confident that we have not been within five hours of one another once since 1999.  Despite these facts, in the handful of times I've lit up since quitting, the one thing that runs through my head is that she might somehow be in the same bar and catch me, and I'll blow my chance  yet again .  In fact, right now I feel sort of like I could use a cigarette.  I'm not going to have one, though.  Why?  Because if on some off chance she's here in Southern Indiana tonight, I want my breath to be as minty fucking fresh as possible.  Even moreso now that I've found out what "torrid" means.
