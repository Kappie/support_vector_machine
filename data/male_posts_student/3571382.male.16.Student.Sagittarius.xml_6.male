So yesterday, Tommy decides he wants to upgrade his computer.  He says we can go to Bestbuy, he's seen their motherboards and processors. He's  seen  them.  So we head out to go to Brighton, we get to Bestbuy, look around. Lo and behold, we can't find any.  So I figured this is the part where Tommy is trying to make me think this was a totally useless trip.  It wasn't.  It actually was a useless trip.  Not really though cuz I picked up a new game.  Fun.  I'm out, later.
