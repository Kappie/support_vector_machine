I don't have the energy to pick this one apart, but I will clip one quote that sent me over the edge.  'The supposedly affordable luxury of a handout to the wealthy over the next decade was relabeled, improbably enough, as a short-term stimulus package.'  So it is a 'handout' when we give money back to those that pay, but an 'entitlement' when we give money to those that don't pay?    The retarded child speaks.  I'm now in favor of post-partum abortion.
