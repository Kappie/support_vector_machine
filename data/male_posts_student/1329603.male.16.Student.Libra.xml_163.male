Gigi went alright, got on OK with peoples and got Â£90 for some decent group playing. w00t, I guess.   Knackered.   My throat is hurting like mad, and my stomach is playing up for some reason.   My Grade 8 is on Wednesday. Oh dear.   HAVEN'T been phoned by Naomi, despite a question over it earlier in the week, when it was Sarah. I suppose that's not too different. Haven't talked to the wee Naomi a lot though.   Have Les Mis tomorrow, maybe starting at 12/1. Yay.   Have finished blog run, including Sam's. Mood = ....not entirely sure, but must remember never to dive too deep into Sam's blog.   Actually quite cold, now. Heating = not so great.   Knackered. Needed saying again.   Suddenly missing Zoe. Sorry, not sure about that one, something just clicked saying "haven't seen her in a while." Meep.   Actually, suddenly missing pretty much everyone I know. w00t.   Ordered a CD today. Hoorah!   Going to get some more food in a minute.   Realised I actually am getting breasts. Must exercise more. In conjunction, my walk feels odd. Not sure about that one, to be honest.
