Righhhtt so I was at my project last night, doing the personal website and boy did it get irritating when I couldn't get it right. I got it like, finally, but I was dead beat that the moment I had my whole body on my bed, everything switched off.   Yesterday was alright, learned a bit and well...got lost when Mr Siah talked about Logic Gates and formulas. He did the sums so quick, I couldn't follow :/ After school me, Amy and Chew Yee went to Causeway Point to get our comics, and surprisingly we went to the library, hah. Chew yee surprised me actually, I didn't know she actually read quite a number of english story books. Sandra brown! haha, all loves stories :/   Then I went over to Pasir Ris to meet  her . Being able to see her, is really important to me. And somehow it lifted my spirits.  I don't mind waiting for you and sending you home is easily the sweetest thing I can do.  Being able to laugh and smile with you, is such a special thing.  I visited Amy's and Xing's blog. Xing, its good you have your blog back up, don't give up on your english. And yeah, I wasn't too happy seeing Xing slack in school, and what's worse is that Kuan KO is almost picking on him. But use it positively and Xing, it'll help you.   Amy (: I just really hope you'll be feeling better yourself too. We're all mentally tired actually if you noticed, but don't ever give up on your faith, the things and people you believe in.   Time for school! No time for quotes and lyrics! BLAH!  Peace.
