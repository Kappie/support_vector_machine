Grandma is talkin bout comin down to visit... well more like comin out since she's in California.  i'm very excited!  i can't wait!  and 4th of july weekend MCOCYG is goin to the Ocoee river to go rafting and have a GREAT time!  can't wait for that either!  anyways... im blabbing on.  i think i shall go and watch some tv or chat online or somethin random.  who knows!
