Although they still have a sent to them it is not so bad. I keep them in my basement and almost everyday now I have to spray them in desenting fluid so that they do not make a stink. I also learned that they can catch and pass on the flu to humans. So we will have to be careful around them during the cold season. Well I went to the Deer Lake Strawberry Festival twice this weekend it was fun. But I have came to the conclusion that Deer Lake is the grumpier version of Pasadena but thats minor stuff. Well our Festival is in a week we have caught a minor problem one of the bands have droped out so we will se how that progresses tomorrow (Monday) we need someone new to play bad!!!  Ahhh well that is all that I have to say for this entry, until next entry.
