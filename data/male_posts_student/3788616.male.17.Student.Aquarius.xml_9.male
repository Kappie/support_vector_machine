Damn it! Argh... man, i am not going to make excuses, cause i admit that i really played a very bad game.  Sorry Mark, Bjorn, Bing Wei, 'Cow', Deepan, Jiade, Raymond and the rest of the team, especially the specific names above though... haiz... i miscued a lot of passes, made bad decisions and man, i really need to by more calm, because of me as the point guard, i screwed up our communications... really sorry to all of you... However, from this, i have learnt much and will take the experience with me, i promise that i would play better next time and train much harder!  However, i can say that, the illness and sickness that i am under didn't help me one bit, after a while, i felt really faint, and seriously couldn't think clearly... I am so sorry that i didn't think of the consequences, thus being extremely blur and lacked the proper strength and mentality to play properly... yup... Yong Xi, you were right! i became a liabilty to our team, and i can't deny that...  The thing that i was most embarrassed about and upset about is that i made a fool of myself in front of Kelly lah! Argh... it's so pai seh! Damn it! haiz... felt like i really let her down... damn it, i WILL work harder and get everything of mine up, all my basics and stuff, i shall improve... anyway, really sorry everyone, if somehow you get to know about my blog that it... and well... really sorry Kelly, cause, i failed to meet your expectations.  From this though, i know that there are things that i lack, and, i am confident that i can improve! So please people, pray for me and give me time ok? heex... yup... and oh... Please continue to pray for my friend who is undergoing her heart mendning, another friend who was my OGL, Geraldine to get well soon... and oh... Friends lyk Yulin, to get over her depression... Cherie to cheer up and forget all her worries... friends like Benjamin, hey, we will always be friends and i will be here to help you... yup... please pray for everyone you know... and... oh... to all out there! Let's trust in the LORD! Keep smiling! ;p
