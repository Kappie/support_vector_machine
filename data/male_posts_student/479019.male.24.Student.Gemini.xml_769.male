I'm getty antsy!  My goal for this semester is to be more active. Quite frankly, I haven't really been happy with my life here in Binghamton. It hasn't been miserable or anything, but it lacks excitement... it lacks debauchery... it lacks great live music... it lacks violence. The lack of structure as well as a lot of things in my life here, causes for an imbalance in everything. I think insomnia, slacking in school work, unhealthy behavior, is all derivative of the lack of order in my life. I need structure and goals.  I remember there was a point in my life that was busy, productive and happy. I was extremely busy coaching, working and going to school. I was doing things that I liked doing such as going to shows. It was great. I was also surrounded by good friends and went to fun shows.  Alas I need something to fill my 5 free days.  I should work out, do artwork, and study more.  ***
