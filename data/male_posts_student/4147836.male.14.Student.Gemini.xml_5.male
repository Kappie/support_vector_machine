Soy un perdedorI’m a loser baby, so why don’t you kill me? Forces of evil on a bozo nightmareBan all the music with a phony gas chamber’cuz one’s got a weasel and the other’s got a flagOne’s on the pole, shove the other in a bagWith the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-jobThe daytime crap of the folksinger slobHe hung himself with a guitar stringA slab of turkey-neck and it’s hangin’ from a pigeon wingYou can’t write if you can’t relateTrade the cash for the beef for the body for the hateAnd my time is a piece of wax fallin’ on a termiteThat’s chokin’ on the splintersSoy un perdedorI’m a loser baby, so why don’t you kill me? (get crazy with the cheese whiz)Soy un perdedorI’m a loser baby, so why don’t you kill me? (drive-by body-pierce)(yo bring it on down)Soooooooyy....(I’m a driver, I’m a winner; things are gonna change I can feel it)Soy un perdedorI’m a loser baby, so why don’t you kill me? (I can’t believe you)Soy un perdedorI’m a loser baby, so why don’t you kill me? Soy un perdedorI’m a loser baby, so why don’t you kill me? (schprechen sie deutches, baby)Soy un perdedorI’m a loser baby, so why don’t you kill me? (know what I’m sayin’? )
