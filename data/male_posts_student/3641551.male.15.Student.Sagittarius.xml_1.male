A wonderful day it was today, full of mishaps and misfortune. But why don't we start from the beginning shall we. Ok, woke up at the extremely early time of 11.00 p.m(or a.m)which is pretty normal since LA was demolished by hundreds of tornadoes, deadly hail in Japan and New York was wiped off the face of this world by a massive flood...( omg The Day After Tomorrow is getting to my head )   After the world catastrophe, where the north part of the world miraculously  migrated into Mexico City and the pyschotic vice-president of the USA turned president and begged forgiveness for being a complete retard, I went with dad to a nearby eatery for a pretty bland brunch(to the slow intellectuals brunch means lunch and breakfast eaten as one)where he nearly lost his patience on a poor old waitress(actually she was young). After that I had to fend off repeated pleas by him to cut my hair. A contest of willpower lasting one hour then preceded where he finally gave up on the hair issue....(actually it was only ten seconds where I lost my temper on him)   Upon returning to my abode the cold hit me. After enduring having to use up half a tissue box I relented to take a panadol for my cold, fighting with my dad in the process. Then I browsed the newspapers for the latest news and fixtures for EURO 2004 as well as the all important odds to feed my gambling habit. After messaging my hypocritical and cheating friend Glen what I wanted to bet on, I promptly fell asleep immediately.  What a relaxing and revitalising sleep I had. I dreampt of uncouth half-naked barbarians attacking me with parangs with me half-heartedly defending with a fishing spear. What proceeded my beauty sleep was me watching TV until dinner time where my mum bought back delicious fragrant roasted duck rice........(actually it had a rotten smell to it) I then watched TV again until switching on this computer and setting up my first blogspot.  After typing this for around half and hour I guess it is time to stop.  Wish me luck on my betting later...........  Regards, B.C aka Star_Of_Light
