I don't know if I mentioned it to anyone while in TO, so quick recap:   I have been taking guitar lessons off and on since last Christmas, and with the help of my teacher, I ordered a specially made guitar by a renowned guitar maker here in Vancouver. It's a different sort of guitar, particularly useful for playing flamenco and classical styles.  The specs I ordered were cedar and french polish for the top plate, Indian rosewood and lacquer finish on the side and back plates, ivory fret board, titanium machine heads (aka "nuts"), normal tension strings, 12-hole bridge, and a beautiful abalone/ivory rosette (the design around the soundhole), carefully handcrafted and shaped like a twisted rope.  It doesn't look impressive when you see it, but wow! Sound projection is excellent and tone quality is dark and brooding, which are perfect for the songs I want to learn.  What have I done with it? Umm...nothing yet. I've sat with it. It's sort of a source of frustration because it put me in the hole. A big one.  And it came at such an inopportune time when I just finished school and want to go out and enjoy my summer.  I feel the pressure since now I have to find a job and I find myself back in the "catch 22" phase.  So it's understandable that I play it...one note at a time.
