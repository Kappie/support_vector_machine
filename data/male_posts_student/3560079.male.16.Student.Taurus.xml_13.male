Just to warn non-swedish people, If you see a post or something in a strange language, it's probably swedish (If I don't say something other).  Not fun today, I have had a cold now for about 2 days, and my throat is still sore even after a kilo Vicks. (Halstabletter?).  I hope this will be a good blog for me where I can remember some sites that I visit, and hopefully somebody will think that my blog will come in handy someday.
