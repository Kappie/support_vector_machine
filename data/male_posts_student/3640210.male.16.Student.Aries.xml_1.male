Things feel very strange, complicated, and all too twisted which is probably a necessary  component of being human, but is still bothersome due to the complexity and murkiness present in my feelings.  Part of me is happy and excited because on saturday morning my friends and I get to leave home behind and venture to Ben's cottage outside Toronto for simply having a great time and reliving some of the *good* parts of the  urlLink choir tour (not including the dying of hair) and also living a whole new, fun experience.  Another part is more somber, contemplative, and slightly darker.  The only things I can attribute this to is boredom, loneliness, and restlessness (without which I would be sleeping with a relatively calm and peaceful mind rather than relating my uneasy, disconnected thoughts by writing a blog entry, but I digress, badly).                 Getting back on topic...  Music is how I usually get by and find a slightly purer clarity in my thoughts.  I don't necessarily like the terminology of "expressing myself" with music because I generally find that listening to music and/or lyrics generally helps to facilatate feelings, emotions, and thoughts that are otherwise difficult to find within myself and experience fully left to my own devices (though writing can do wonders).  Maybe "Musical Facilitation of Mental Such and Such" is the term I'm looking for as "Expression" doesn't seem to conotate understanding as much as it does communication (but then again, MFMSS may just conotate babbling).  The reason I bring all this up is that I'm having a hard time finding the right music to listen to.  It's not that I don't have enough music (though you can never have enough) to listen to, it's just that I can't find the music that fits my mood due to the somewhat contradictory parts of my emotional state outlined above.  I have a library of thirteen hundred fourty seven songs but I'm having trouble coming up with a playlist or even some individual songs that work with my mood.  So it's frustrating (though not greatly) and places me in an awkward position of just biding my time, trying to figure myself out a bit more while I wait for inspiration to float through the air and glide into my ears... or smack me in the face, that works too.
