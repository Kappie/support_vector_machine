The blog post title is from when I asked Luke Osborne what the plan was for tonight.  Today I'm having lunch with my old boss. She's taking me to the Elmwood for helping her with code I wrote for her website last week.  Since payroll has changed for everyone starting next month, they needed a different way to report time in Facilities, and the script I wrote them last year needed some tweaking.  All I asked for was cookies.. but instead she is taking me to lunch.  I'll let ya know how it goes.  My meeting this morning to Helenwood Hall was moved without notice (to me).  Whoops.. luckily I don't have to go at 11 now, else I would have to cancel my lunch date.  Britney Spears has canceled her tour this Summer.  So she won't be coming to Darien Lake.  Shucks.  My eye is bothering me.  My toe is bothering me.  I'm a mess. Heh.
