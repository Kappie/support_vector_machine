I will update this post when I change it...I had made another one but then I figured I have all of my older posts in this one! I can just change my URL o cool... Well, if you want to check out last nights post its at urlLink http://therlegion.blogspot.com Ok? My new URL is....  urlLink http://PITSD.blogspot.com . That stands for Pittsburgh - San Diego... My two favorite places!
