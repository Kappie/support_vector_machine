All in all...it wasn't as horrible as some people had said and are saying.  The test seemed to start out hard and then got kinda easier.  Tyke thought he remembered the court case questions pretty well.  But he still will probably end up getting like a 58%.  Which should end up being like a B or so.  That would be cool if he did get an A- in there but there probably isn't any chance of that.  Then he had then english presentation go.  And they got through only one freaking presentation.  And they kinda stopped that one short too.  After that was over, Tyke, Purdy, and Dotti all went out to lunch together.  A lovely decision to do so.  They went to Goodfella's and it was awesome.  As usual.  Tyke decided to just stick with the turkey'n'cheese today and got a drink and it was a fine decision.  Mmmmmm...not to mention the price is solid.  Cheaper than Subway...and better too.  They just chatted it up like good friends.  Reminiscing about old times...looking to the future.  Just girl talk with a guy really.  Then they went back to the school to get all the cars and they went and talked to Nullification Crisis.  Her baby is growing up.  Just like most kids do.  Get bigger and older and wiser.  And stronger...than yesterday...ahh what a great song.  Tyke and the crew listened to that yesterday at Ungy's house.  After Tyke said his loving departures to Purdy and Dotti (and no Tyke was not trying to kiss her when leaving) he called up the Macaroon man.  He drove on overs to his house and met up with Fejj, Amed, Dr. Phil, and K-caj.  They all played Halo and Fejj and Tyke were a good team but of course no match for Dr and Macaroon.  Macaroon had the shooting down.  But Tyke is a good shot at sniping too.  After that they went to play basketball.  They ended up going down to Lakemont to play.  But it was still fun.  Tyke was the force again.  He didn't win either games of 21 cuz he got tipped incessantly.  But he very easily could have if he didn't get tipped more than 20 times.  Amed somehow pulled out a miraculous first round victory.  But the second round saw quite a change.  The Dr. Phil Lelee made his move to stop Amed's presence down low.  And man did it work.  The "shadow D" was unstoppable.  Amed got so angry and lost complete focus.  On his free throws he just ended up throwing the ball at Dr. and then everytime that happened Dr. Phil ran up to Amed when he got the ball back and just bear hugged him.  No stopping that.  Amed lost it all.  The faces he made and the vein popping out of his head was priceless.  Not to mention the fact that he was yelling and throwing bows and everything.  It was awesome.  Then they played HORSE (PIG actually).  That was Tyke's game yet again.  Amed ended up sitting out because he couldn't take the presence of Dr. Phil out there.  Then he just shouted profane comments at Dr. while he was shooting.  They were stupid yet hilarious.  He kept yelling pretty boy.  That was great.  Dr. Phil somehow made a surprising bid to the final round after Tyke knocked out all the other players but one earlier.  Dr. Phil's no jump shots were starting to get hot but Tyke quickly stopped that and made them as well...then Phil lost it.  So Tyke made his move.  Since Lelee's Prove It was done with Tyke had to just get him to miss a shot and it was over.  So he just went for the easy bank shot and that did him in.  It was a great day again.  Then they played 3 on 3.  Tyke, Amed, and K-caj took the opposers.  Tyke's ball control, penetrating abilities, and ability to dish to the open man were incredible and just unstoppable.  He even finished at the hoop very well.  A solid performance definitely.  Then they all went back to Macaroon's and split up.  Then Tyke went home and fuck the police.  Stupid motherfucking cops sitting out waiting for a hot guy to drive by and guess what, one did.  Just sitting on his leather-bound ass letting gravity take care of his beer belly and his cue-ball head.  Fuck him.  48 in a 35.  That's nothing.  That's hardly even speeding.  Tyke even was nice enough to brake when he saw the cop.  But the guy still got him from 978 feet away.  That seems like a long way.  But he still got hit with the $132 fine.  That's just gay.  So now he has to do traffic court or whatever.  The cop just told him to go see some officer at the school tomorrow and get it settled with her or something.  That was gay.  This is gay.  Damn stuff like this.  Cuz this goes on top of his bad grades so that is just like double kill.  And this double kill is like when you are one of the two people getting killed, not the one who killed two people.  That way is good.  Well, this is not fun,  He wishes he just could have a 4.0 and no tickets still.  That would be much better.  But anyway, Tyke still has the night ahead of him but he is really hungry so he is going to get something to eat.  He still isn't sure if the bball game against Ekul, etc is on tomorrow but it should be.  Gotta get that win.  Well, lunch was really fun today but no Friends night again.  And it is an hour long one too.  So it would have been more fun than usual.  Oh well, can't win em all.  But Tyke likes to win most.  If not all.  But since he lost this one he already can't win em all.
