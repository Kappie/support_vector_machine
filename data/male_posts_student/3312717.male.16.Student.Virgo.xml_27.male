That's soon to change though, since I'm sitting on an 89.7% in the class.  My Gatsby essay is sure to push it up. . . I hope.  I'm going to a wedding on Friday in Granite Falls so I won't be in school for the second half of the day.  The only class I'll really miss anything in is chemistry.  Ahh chemistry. . .it feels good to have the highest grade in a class.  In fact, I haven't felt this good since last year in biology, before Johnny V. snuck up on my "A" and crushed my dreams forever.  Enough talk about science, besides, Mattson should be almost sick just seeing the words chemistry and science so much.  I'll post on Monday, on Monday, on Mon. . . .
