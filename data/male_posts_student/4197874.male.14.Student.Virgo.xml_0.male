After i was done messing around we had an asslembly and the teachers all ran in when they were announced and we all laughed at them and then i went to English class and the teacher was mean and stupid so i just kinda sat there and took tests. After that it was Gym class and most of the people didn't bring clothes so we all just kinda ran around in circles for 80 minutes. After that was lunch and i was dying of hunger so i went down that and cut in front of all the freshmen to get in line and they were telling me i couldn't but i just went  :big: and stood there talking to a couple people. We went out through the door and got our salad dressing and then walked to our table to find it was full and so we all had to go cram around this little table and it really sucked :-\ After lunch we had homeroom and me and 4 other friends just sat there playing mad libs while the other people were all chatting and it was hilarious because one person chose bacon and one part rhymed with awaken bacon :XD After homeroom i stayed in the room because it was my next class  :3nod: and basically we just kinda sat there and took notes and stuff and he told us we were going to have a quiz every day and we have one next class already but it is on the rules of the class which i don't even have to look over :XD ... After that we had Drafting (arcitecture class) and he taught us how to make letter so i felt like i was in advanced Pre- School and i just kinda sat there and watched the other people work because i didn't have any of my stuff but i have all next class to work on it all :3nod: And then the day was over and i went home and ate and slept  :XD  (yes i typed this up on gaia and just sent the whole thing over to here) >.>;;
