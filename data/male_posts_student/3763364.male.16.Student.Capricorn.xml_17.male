Each chain is pulling me in a different direction.  What-evar! Ha...   At times I ponder why it is I'm still here. I mean, if I've been so lonely and depressed for so long, why haven't I just shot myself in the freakin head?  It looks like I haven't entirely given up hope. My optimism was stricken of me, but still I retained hope. It would seem that there is a shred of hope that never dies in man, one that keeps us fighting, even on the throes of death. Is it this shred, this tiny bit of hope that has kept me alive all this time?  I suppose there is a shred of hope in me that has not yet died. Yes. At the core, at my very core, in the blackest black, in the deepest depths of me, there resides the hope that one day her and I will be together, and that I will one day live again.    Fuck! Is anyone else watching "The Fast and The Famous" on MuchMusic? These fucking rap stars each have like a dozen cars, every one of which is worth twice as much as my fucking house!  Wow. That's not the most retarded thing I have ever seen.  These rap "stars" have no talent. They don't sing, they only talk in rhyme about cops and drugs and bitches, or whatever the hell else being a "gangsta" involves. What, because Ludacris can prance around like a moron on stage, demeaning women and putting a bad name on his culture, he gets to make fifty million dollars a year, when my family (family being my mother and I) can barely afford to live? My mother gets to drive around in a used Pontiac Sunfire, and Ludacris gets to drive around, guzzling as much gasoline as beer in his fucking Escalade!? Ludacris gets to live in a fucking mansion, and we get to live in FOREST LAWN!? HE CAN'T EVEN SPELL HIS OWN NAME RIGHT!  LUDICROUS! IT'S LUDICROUS!  Fuck...excuse me while I go eviscerate some innocent bystanders.
