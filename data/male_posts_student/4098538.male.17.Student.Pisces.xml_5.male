'unnamed girl')and I planned going to the cinema on Boxing Day seen as it was shut on Christmas Eve, but the buses were being bitches and not running, so I couldn't get into town! So Mandy came round and stayed! It was so nice! I asked her out that night and she said, 'Yes please'! Aww! So I just wanna state that I AM OFFICIALLY WITH AMANDA-LAILA EID! Then yesterday we spent the whole day in town. I bought a few CD's, a ticket for CHIMAIRA, and we went to the cinema (see, we got there in the end!). We also went to Pizza Hut and had the most retarded waitress ever. She was so dull. She brought us the wrong pizza at first. She had cuts all over her face and a huge forehead. WHY was she working there? She spoke funny too. Like she had a wall of slime over her mouth. Anyway... Mandy stayed again last night! We both dyed our hair... I did mine dark-red again and she did hers pink! I am so happy I am with her. She had to go this morning damn it... shall see her soon hopefully though.
