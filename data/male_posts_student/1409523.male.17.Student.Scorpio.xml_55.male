(im not excited about that... ) BUT that means two THREE DAY WEEKENDS IN A ROW!!!! so kick ass... i love it... if only i can survive this week.. then i am home free....so lets update since the last time..... uhmmmm.....so since last monday i haven't really done anything productive but i have been enjoying myself.... i stayed home on friday and just relaxed i watched some t.v. and read my cleveland mafia book.... then i went to pep band (ahhh yes... such a band fag).... well it was pretty fun i admit i didn't want to go at first but everyone was there... grant molly jeff luke clay fuller minar... it was fun... we played cards and the highlight... it was kevin bourassa singing the national anthem (with an english accent i might add) he looked confused too... but he sang ok actually... after we went out to chipotle .... BEST RESTAURANT EVER... i love that place so very much.... i mean where else can you get a burrito THAT BIG... then saturday i went to trumpet did that did chores and went to a concert with sarah and jen and katie.... the list goes on.... that was fun although i think besides sarah jen katie and kim i was the only other person who enjoyed it... lauren made a huge deal about the fact that she didn't believe in god and doesn't like christian rock and left... after i talked to jen for a while (im glad to have found someone who actually has the same taste in music, its kind of refreshing...) and went home.... then sunday was kind of dull ... i went to clit... um.. i mean C.L.T.... yeah thats right... and i had to sit through the most unbearable of speaker who basically told us that pop culture is bad and that were going to hell.. he was VERY optimistic .... let me tell you.... so anyways... this has to be short b.c it is pretty late.... i will write something more interesting than this later.. just thought i would bring it up to date... night ...
