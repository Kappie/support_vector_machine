It rained today, just as I'd predicted, at the time I predicted. Can be used as a good evangelical tool. I reminded Ziz and he told me "By the power of God almighty". I don't know what to say to that, but I wholeheartedly agree.  I watched the passion today. Was uncharacteristically detached during the course of the gorish binge. Wouldn't actually call it a binge, but it makes me sound clever. I did flinch and occasionally scream at the screen for them to "STOP HITTING HIM ALREADY!!!" MY GOD IS GOOD and he did that for me. The very one who murdered him. Cried many times in service. I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown.
