He also thinks we should to try not to offend our friends and allies (read: France and Germany) in our quest to rid the world of stupid morons. So these people fly two airplanes into skyscrapers, killing 3,000 people, behead American citizens, and terrorize a goverment into submission (Spain), and we should be more sensitive in the way we take care of them. And how DARE we offend Old Europe in the process of defending our national security?! I don't think this man UNDERSTANDS national security.
