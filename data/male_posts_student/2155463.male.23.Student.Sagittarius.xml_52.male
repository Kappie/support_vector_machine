Then I had parking at church, and it was INTERESTING...people were sliding all over the place, and some knuckleheads just didn't get it through their heads that you SLOW DOWN when it's snowy and slippery like that out.  But it was still fun...I love doing it on those inclement days.  And I get to wave at everyone...maybe it's just a small-town thing, but that's one thing I miss - in St. Marys everyone waved at everyone (you know, just to say "hi"), even if you didn't know the person.  Around here, people don't even wave at people they know...  Sometimes I wonder why I go to church...I'm probably one of the few people who consistently feels WORSE leaving church than they do when they get there.  Sometimes I feel so bad from service I just up and skip Sunday School.  Now I'm not talking about feeling physically ill, but more like I think about things and get too introspective...for some reason church just seems like an easy place to do so.  Anyway...at least I finally think I figured out why I'm unable to get into any relationships during Sunday School today (but I'm not ready to post it on here yet :().  Other than that...came home and basically bummed around until I had to go back to church at 4:00.  I had nursery for the Christmas concert tonight, so I get there and THEN I find out that I have the toddlers (you know, the Terrible Twos)...and to make matters worse, I walk in and there's immediately two kids crying (and I'm the ONLY ONE in there).  So anyway...eventually it gets to about 5-on-1 and someone has mercy and comes in to help me.  My MOM was supposed to be there, but she was running late; of course, I was getting a LITTLE concerned about her coming at all.  Anyway...eventually everything gets shaked out, so we can just worry about the kids - and man, we sure had to worry about the kids.  I won't get into all the sordid (and I do mean sordid) details, but suffice to say we had our hands full.  But it was still fun (in hindsight ;).  So I come home...what can I say about the Browns?  Heartbreakers...it's definitely a love-hate relationship I have with them.  HOW CAN YOU GIVE UP A 30-YARD COMPLETION WITH LESS THAN A MINUTE LEFT IN THE GAME?!  OK, now that I've vented...it was a good game guys, you weren't supposed to do that well against Denver (who am I kidding?...YOU SCREWED UP - AGAIN!).  With that happy thoughts, I think I'm going to go to bed before 10 PM for the first time in months, maybe years...g'night. :)
