I juz can't seem to score more than 2 goals. L0L! Hopefully I can get the chance to score a hat trick nxt wk. 4 goals in 2 matches isn't bad at all too. L0L!  I was squashed by tt fat pussy cat today while we were waitin for the nxt period teacher to come. He kept sitting on me and refused to budge. He also did stupid stuff to me as usual. At one point he used his stinkin back to lean against me! YUCKS! At least he didnt use other parts of his stinkin body. L0L!  The rest of the day was slack and boring. After sch was Chinese Oral at 2:30pm, which was like 2hrs after sch was over. I didnt haf breakfast, recess or lunch on tt day and boy was I suffering. I was tired, exhausted and drained. By the time I faced the examiners, I was lost for words. I think tt was a total disaster, but I juz hope to pass, tt's good enough for me already.  After the damn oral was over. I went to Jurong Entertainment Centre wif Alvin to finally grab a bite. Man was tt gd. He told me some stuff bout' frenship and ppl in our cls. It's pretty surprising to hear wad he had to say bout' certain ppl in cls. Although he wasn't the first person to tell me this kindda stuff, but it was still pretty astonishing. I haf heard a lot of stuff frm ppl bout' who they dislike hate and sometimes it's realli shocking. By juz lookin at how this person mingle wif the other, u may think tt they're on good terms, but in actual fact, they hate each other. U'll nvr know wad the other party truly feels bout' u and sometimes tt realli does sux! I juz hope tt ppl like Hongyue, Mal, fat pussy cat, lil' pig and some others are truly on good terms wif me and do not actually dislike or hate me.  We went to Popular after tt as Alvin wanted to get a Cd. He asked me to help him choose between Clay Aiken and some Chinese singer. Although I disliked Clay Aiken, I'm nvr gonna choose a Chinese singer. He asked the ppl there if he cld listen to both b4 deciding. They agreed and he asked me to listen to both. Clay Aiken was normal, but the song tt I listened frm tt Chinese singer was juz superb. It's been quite a while since I last listened to Chinese songs too. So he asked me again which one shld he buy. This time I said the Chinese one. L0L!  When I got home at around 5pm, I rested on my bed. My legs were aching and I couldn't walk properly. Yea, I was limping, probably due to the fact tt I had played floor ball in 2 consecutive days and fell down like 8 times. L0L! So I basically slacked for the rest of the day and chat on msn wif ppl. Well, guess tt's bout' it for today. Cya soon! =]
