It's a shame the less talented teachers don't go... like M.A. Constantine. But she's holding on for the sympathy vote! And Luke Bradbury too. God he was annoying.  Anyway, Lauren SHUT YA BIG MOUTH!!! I didn't even Luke was his name! Obviously someone did a little research into the matter. Oh well. We did come up with some funny stuff. Betty Crum-Swack, Metty Swinge, Betty Swoobs, Cletty Sweavage! Oh the list is endless.  I had the weirdest dream too! I was staying in America with some one who lived on 10th street! thats all I can remember!  Feel free to post your dreams on here and I will try to a) analyse them or b) rip the piss out of you!   I'm spent!
