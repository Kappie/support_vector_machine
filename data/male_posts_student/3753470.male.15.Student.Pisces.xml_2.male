(if you've ever been to my house you'll know what I mean.) So we became shirt ninjas (there's a rather simple technique where you turn a shirt inside out and kinda put it on and tie it just so, so that it looks like a ninja mask) and went outside and up the road just walking around. Not wanting to go back home we went up the road to a new housing developement called "Huntstone" and walked around up there. Now...I didn't think anyone lived there yet....I found that I was wrong. Walking past some houses I saw two different houses with a car in the driveway and one little dogwouldn't stop barking. We couldn't turn back now because we didn't know if it would take longer to go back or forward so we kept going and eventually made it to the main road. As we came over the crest of a hill I saw my dad pull out of the driveway and go up the road, when we got down the driveway we saw him go past the house and by the other way (strange). Brandon and I went to the backyard and were hanging out when my dad came up (didn't see us at first and went to the shop) and told us quite demandingly to "Get in here." Here being the shop. Once we were inside he asked where we went and we said up the road and he said "Well a lady from up at Huntstone called the police and said she saw two young men walking around up there and she was afraid they were gonna tear something up". Holy crap! But...then my dad told us that he was kidding and the police hadn't been called.      I still haven't started reading...and I haven't written (book) in several days...DAGNABBIT! And I have English first semester so I'm screwed unless I get to readin'.      Well if I haven't told you (which I probably didn't) I'm trying to start a band and my cousin may be in now. My brother rented a snowboarding game with a song called "Courage" by Alien Ant Farmand it's been stuck in my head ALL DAY.       That is all.
