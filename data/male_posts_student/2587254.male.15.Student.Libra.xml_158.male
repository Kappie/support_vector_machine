Today, June 26th, 2004, marks my first day behind the wheel of a car, and holy crap I'm horrible at it lol. Well at the moment at least. Actually my turning is good, but my sense of how much pressure to apply on the pedals...THAT will require some work. Also, I can park as well as Gavin does going forward...except I parked rear first...and yet I still parked just as bad as Gavin...which therefore means I can own him parking forwards =P. Also today was also the first time I've rehearsed with dual guitar and bass plus vocals for worship, and also today was our church picnic, where I got to eat the food that I prepared along with my dad and Jason, Gavin and Josh. Though Jason still talks about how he couldn't eat the stuff we prepared, I didn't mind...it's still food...and it still was good. In fact, I even picked up my signiture "J-Shroom" *a mushroom with my carved "J" on it* that I learned off that Chinese cooking show off Omni 2, except he did a star, which I did also =). I'm approaching chef level 1...for creativity at least haha.  After a crazy night of NFL/NBA Street last night with Jason, Gavin and Josh, plus some stupid stuff like random talking and throwing crap around the place, we finally got to sleep around 3am or so, with Jason going off to play SC until 5am sadly lol. Well we all got up today around 10am, and quickly got ready to go to the picnic. Started the morning with more gaming, and then we just kinda chatted around and stuff. Some of our voices are kinda cracked now from all the yelling and stuff, but yeah it's all good. I'm lucky to have parents that can tolerate us being loud. I mean me I'm already annoying enough yelling "MOM" from the basement just to figure out where she was in the house, in fact Jason and them threw a Moose and a Squirrel at me *stuffed animals* to shut me up. Yeah eventually when she replied I just said "HI" and she just ignored me. Plus when us four are together, we make rock bands sound like flutes.  We got to the picnic around 11am, and surprisingly I saw Anton and Jonny there. Calvin invited them, and yeah it was cool how they came. Rebecca then saw my hair, and she was surprised I took all of it off too. Calvin said the exact same thing Josh said:  "Hey Joe, if you add 6 dots to your forhead, you could be a monk. STEVE DUONG WANNABE."  First off I only cut it this way because I screwed up cutting it before, and secondly, HOW MANY BALD ASIANS ARE THERE? LOTS. ARE THEY ALL STEVE DUONG WANNABE'S?! *Calvin you're an idiot.*  We started the day off with some ultimate frisbee, and apparently Rebecky was sick today =(. It was Gavin's Birthday, and once Vince found out, Gavin got the beats haha. So after that, we started playing frisbee as mentioned before. We drawed, with my team consisting of Anton, Jason, Mike, and Rebecky. We drawed, and then we all quit when Calvin and Josh spirit fingered the frisbee...which was really lame. But after that, came food. The food that we prepared =). It was actually pretty good, and as said before I even found my trademark "J-Shroom." Last year I found my super onion shish-kabob, and this year I found the shish-kabob that I made for myself =P. After eating and chatting for a bit about random stuff from Power Rangers Movie on CityTV the other day *me and Vince butchered it* all the way to random fads of our past, we then played some football. Me, Pastor D, Josh, Jason, Rebecky and Carmen L. were all on one team against Calvin, Gavin, Jonny, Anton, and Jacky. We won despite the fact they tried running real plays...PHHT that shows how useful THEY are. Actually also because Calvin' doesn't know anything about football...he didn't know you can't forward lateral or the fact a centre can't run with the ball after the QB calls "Hut." Anyways that was fun, we owned....35-21 or so....and yeah after that we lounged around for a bit before I left with Vince, Gavin, Rebecky and Josh to go to worship practice.  I ALMOST for got my sandals but lucky Dad grabbed them.  And so we got to the church and began rehearsal. Started a bit wonky, but we made a strong finish at the end which I'm happy for. I find it annoying though how Gavin wanted me to play the drums to this one song EXACTLY the same way....though I thought it was retarded. I refused to in the end anyways, and we changed the songs up, but when we play a song, IT CAN HAVE VARIATIONS. But we managed to have some fun still, and get business done by the end, so yeah it was all good =).  Then when we were leaving, Vincent decided to take me, Gavin, and Josh out for a mini-road test. Gavin drove nicely, as did Josh *since he has G1.* Me on the other hand, yeah...that's another story as mentioned before. I park better than Gavin, I can turn, I can almost break well now....but I just learned the fact today that cars go by themselves at 5km/h or so WITHOUT applying gas. Sadly, I know how a car works, yet I don't know that basic thing. I know it goes disengaging in neutral, on Park the brakes lock, and something that most people probably don't know how, how a supercharger/turbocharger works. yet, I don't know that cars move without applying gas. Oh yeah I also managed a few turns using the one hand technique, which I feel special for. I can drive with one hand...like many others....but still I feel special =P. Problem is though I had to learn it's hand over hand for turning and not hand under hand with my hands upside down...apparently I die doing that =P. So with my skills, and my lack of senses at the moment, I managed to brake while turning *which is a good thing,* unfortunately AFTER that when I applied gas, I forgot about the fact cars move on their own a bit, so I hit a bit too much in, and....   SCREEEEEECH!   I graze/hit a siderail, bending it and causing me to go into shock. So for a few moments I was thinkin' "crap I just ruined Vincent's front" but apparently he said it's buffable...so WHEW. At least I didn't break a light...as I know that costs $$$...LOTS of it. Well yeah...I better work on my driving...but it was sure as hell fun...and a memory that will last forever I think haha. At the moment though, 10km/h seems fast to me, and I'll never yell at my parents to go faster when they are going 40km/h in a residential area. I won't complain about things I can't do myself.  Well after that first-time experience moment, we headed to Swiss Chalet for Gavin's Birthday. Vincent paid for us all, but I'm going to pay him back tomorrow. Swiss Chalet honestly though sucks. The chicken is dry, forcing you to use that crap dip they provide, which made life worse. Only reason why I can somewhat tolerate it is because their mashed potatoes actually are decent...unlike some other places. It was good times though, lots of laughs, and we eventually started talking about Vince's childhood for a bit after he showed us his still well-kept Banting Student ID. Me and Gavin ordered ice cream then, and Josh had his pie, and then we left.  First dropped off Gavin, and then Rebecky and Josh, and then me since I live only about 5 minutes drive from Vince.  Anyways getting late...and I gotta wake up early for worship rehearsal tomorrow.  Later.
