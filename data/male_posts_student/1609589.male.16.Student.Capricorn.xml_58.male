Old ones: The old Dexters Lab, Powerpuff girls, they used to be funny, but they always make fun of anime, and they take it WAY too seriously. So that means it's crap.  New ones: New Dexter's lab, Samurai Jack, That stupid new teenage-robot thing on Nickelodeon, all of them are crap because they make no sense, and they look like crap.   The reviewers all said Samurai Jack is "visually appealing." Bull crap, the guy just drew a bunch of squiggles on a piece of paper  called it background, took the Professor from Powerpuff Girls, widened his eyes  called him a hero, and replaced good voice acting/story with mindless action. Complete bullcrap.  Cartoon Network is almost completely bullcrap now, too. The only thing saving it right now, and I mean the ONLY thing, is Ed Edd and Eddy. And that show has 1 more season left before it's gone. Cartoon Network is a lost cause.  Hate to say it, but Nickelodeon is heading that way too. It has a couple good things tho, Spongebob, Fairly Oddparents, and when that guy who hosts "funniest kid in america" and Dave Aizer got killed by firing squad on live TV, that was great, too. Or maybe i just dreamed that.  I've turned to Comedy Central, because almost all of their shows are good. Not Crank Yankers or Man Show though, those 2 are just stupid.  I'm With Busey is freaking hillarious, and I'm actually having fun watching Last Comic Standing. I watch Friday Night Standup every.... friday night....  They need to stop showing those damn 80's movies that aren't funny, though. They need to put on some Who's Line Is It Anyway, and buy back rights to MST3k so they can show the old Comedy Central episodes, and quit running SNL reruns so damn often.  And that's my section on TV tonight, folks. See ya!
