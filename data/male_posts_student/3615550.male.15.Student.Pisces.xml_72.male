We have about 12 acres of grass to cut, and even though my dad helps me out, it still takes a few days.  Also, since I am homeschooled and we just built a house and moved a few days ago, I am not finished with school for the year yet.  It will get done, I just won't get much of a summer vacation.  I have also been visiting other blogs and commenting on them.  A busy life, combined with the fact that the parental controls on my computer only allow me two hours of internet access on weekdays, makes it hard for me to find stories of interest.    Hopefully, things will be calming down soon, and I will be able to return to my previous posting schedule.  Until then, I will just have to do my best.  Thanks for reading!  Be blessed!
