In the tournament today, Ankur beat Owen 11-7 (the main event), and Sunny beat Samyak 11-6 (too bad nobody was watching). Abdullah is presently beating Simran 4-0...ouch, poor Sim, he   really got screwed over  ...everybody does realize that the brackets are just pretense for an   Abdullah-Eugene final   right? ...right? That'll be really cool though.   History...shhh everybody,   desperate times call for desperate measures  , so I was forced to forge my dad's signature for my progress report...I'm such a bad kid. And how are we supposed to take notes on movies if you can't even see your paper? Damn, I was scored on   for the first time   in PE courtesy of Kevin. It's all good though, it was this tricky shot that grazed the left post and ricocheted into the goal. English...I didn't finish my journal entry but since Harris only looks to see if you wrote something, I just bs'd it...something like..."I hope nobody does read this, for if I do have my journal read   I will be so screwed and fail this class  . Ah, too bad." And Gina stamped it. Yes!  There's presently a campaign to pants Richard (so money's obviously involved)...uh...don't ask,   you don't wanna know...
