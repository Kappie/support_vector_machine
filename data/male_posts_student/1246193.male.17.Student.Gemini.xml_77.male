We have all heard famous people claim that they make music because it makes them happy. They just want other people to experience what makes them feel good, as long as they pay fifteen bucks for ten songs-one of which they want. I am one of those people that envelopes themselves in music to find pleasure. However, I am not going to spend money on music. It may be illegal; I can understand why. I won't stop!
