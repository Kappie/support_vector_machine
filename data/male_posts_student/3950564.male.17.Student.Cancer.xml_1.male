I am not ashamed to admit it,I did cry when I saw it and nowI feelreally crappy. I am just so mad at myself because I did so bad, and I would like to thank everyone for there support. After abouthalf an hour reflecting on my score and how I letmyself down with my 3, I went outside and started a fire in our burning pit. After it gotto abig enoughsize, I gatheredup all my AP notebooks that I had used for the text and threw themin, following with my notecards. Watching them burn cheered me up quite a bit. Finally I threw inthe newspaper with Dr. Pattersons huge picture on it! That topped it off, and I walked inside leaving the fire to burn. I am still feel really bad, disappointed, and depressed, but that burning made me feel better. Now I am worried about what people will think of me and my low score......... I know that I deserved to get a 4.
