NUMBER 9 IM HUNTING YOU DOWN.  on a lighter note, merchant marine was awsome, and there were actually girls there too!!!!. as a plebe, your not allowed to go out until the end of september, but after that, on saturdays you get leave from 12 to 12. thats 12 hours to do whateveryou want. im prolly going to come home once a month if im able to. but whenever your home, go into the city and ill meet up with anyone and chill... thats prolly beter than staying in a parking lot in north rockland anyway.  thats all i got to say, take it or leave it darin
