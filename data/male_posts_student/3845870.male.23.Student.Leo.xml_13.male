I have a sneaking suspicion a repeat performance will be demanded sometime soon so they can see the rest. And hey, it's not like I mind watching the West Wing. There's a reason I own all the DVD's. But sleep would be nice. And I'm trying to break the habit of sleeping during the day. There aren't enough nocturnal ppl in the world for me to find that worthwhile.
