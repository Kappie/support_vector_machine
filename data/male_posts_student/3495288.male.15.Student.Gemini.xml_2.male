I couldn't think, eat, sleep, talk, walk, do anything properly. Their touch are very sinful. Its painful. I cannot sleep at night without HIM saying good night to me. Afraid to be touched by someone else. Raped, Molested, Searched, Mad Man, Horny Guy, Devil, Carpark, Toilet, A Dark Corner. Is he going to save me from this Dark and Deep hole full Misery? What am i suppose to do with this Knife stuck in my head, which goes in deeper everytime i think of IT. Will i die slowly and peacefully being POSITIVE? What is their next move? Am i going to be hunt down till they make the worst out of me? What is HE going to do, to help me? Injustice. Fear, Pain, Misery. Flashes of the worst memories are repeating in my head, blinding me. I can't take it anymore! Life is stupid, True love is nonsense when one is lost. Whats the true meaning of LIFE? Whats the true meaning of TRUE LOVE? Am i going to be mentally disabled after what had happened to me? Fear, Pain, Misery. Injustice. I can't remember what happened to me. Fainted on the staircase. Lost a bit of my memory, i think. Received an e-mail from HIM. I had hurt him. I broke the biggest promise that i made from the day we met. Will he come back to me, after what i have done and gone through and the sins i made? Is he going to ignore me for now or forever? I can't forgive my self, I hurt him too much. I hurt him. I hurt him. His feelings. My pain. I hurt him. I hurt him. He hates me now. He hates me forever. UGH! AH! too much pain. - Avoid me now, Avoid me forever. I am the BEAST whom Beauty is ignoring. Why am i born as the Beast? I am suppose to be DEAD! after what i have done. I hurt, kill, murder! Hurt the childrens, Kill the innocents, Murder the cupids. I am suppose to be BURNT INTO ASHES by the villages with BEAUTY either laughing at me for what i have done or crying for no reason. In reality, To get his blessings of forgiveness NOW is to really burn myself into ashes and let the wind blow me away freely. Than i think He will forgive me, for my sins, for my wrong doings, for the trouble i have brought him in. I did not bring him into New Heights Of Adventure. Reason to why i wanted him is that i want to bring him into NEW HEIGHTS OF ADVENTURES and make his life colourful but it seems i am the Jink that prevents him from going to new heights, the bleach that removes the colours. Is this the destination FAITH have shown me? Am i going to be a LONER in life AGAIN? I have no one else but HIM to turn to everytime but now he is doesn't want me to turn to him. I have no one now. LIFE DEPRESSION SUCKS FUCK! PAIN!!! RAPED MOLESTED SEARCHED CRUISED PAIN!!! ALONE   -----------------------------------------------------------------
