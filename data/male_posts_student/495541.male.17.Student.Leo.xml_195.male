Then I went off to an individual workout at 10.  It was alright.  Could have been better but it doesn't matter now... it's over.  Now there's nothing going on until Monday next week.  This weekend will be tight.  Tonight there's the basketball BBQ which will be interesting.  Now for a completely random picture.     Peace out.
