It's kinda hard to laugh with a group of strangers, but i got through it. The shimp quesadilla was on time. It was great. After that I spent some time with Mary Grace and then decided to come to my hometown with one stop light. I went to church, learned some stuff about evangelism, and came home and watched television. Great day. Ive been up since 11:02.   //I got some feedback about my first post, and i guess i need to address it now. The dates are right, but i am posting my blog past midnight the next morning. So, it appears to have the date of the next day. Its crazy, but im sure you'll get it.  //I didnt have any time to read today. Well i guess i did, but i was a bit lazy and found something i thought was more important to do. Still on page 56. I need to commit more time reading because i just feel like a bad person by not doing it. I just placed the book right in front of my moniter, so that when i am about to get on the computer tommorow or i guess you could say today, i would read instead of talking to my friends and downloading copyrighted things. hehe.  //I had an in-depth conversation with this girl from Fuge about my relationship with God. Her name is Brandy, and she told that i needed to wait from an answer from God. Ive been prayin for a while now, and ive been seeking a stronger relationship with Him. I think im no where near where He wants me now. i want to be closer and on a higher level with Him. Ive been waiting for quite some time now. I know He is working on it, and i know i will be there one day. I need you guys to be prayin for me.   //Another night here at my computer. I kinda enjoy this blog thing. Im not promising a blog every night, but i like writing and im sure there will be more in the future. I need to get some sleep. Its 12:45 so it is gonna say thursday but remember that im writing about wednesday. hehe. im out like a fat kid in dodgeball. PEACE
