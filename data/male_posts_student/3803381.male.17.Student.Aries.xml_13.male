I asked them what they were doing, and they said they were going to the Seventh Day Adventist Church. I was intrigued. I had heard of Adventists before, but I didn't know what they believed. So I got online and did some research. Basically, all their beliefs seemed to line up with mine, except (possibly, but I'll have to do some more research) for the fact that they believe that that a woman, Ellen G. White, was given over 2,000 prophesies by God in her lifetime.   "Seventh-day Adventists believe that Mrs. White was more than a gifted writer; they believe she was appointed by God as a special messenger to draw the world's attention to the Holy Scriptures and help prepare people for Christ's second advent. From the time she was 17 years old until she died 70 years later, God gave her approximately 2,000 visions and dreams. The visions varied in length from less than a minute to nearly four hours. The knowledge and counsel received through these revelations she wrote out to be shared with others."    http://www.whiteestate.com  Now, if all the prophesies have come true, and they are consistent with what the Bible teaches, then I have no problem with Adventism. But, if even one prophesy is wrong, then I believe that Adventism has a serious flaw, and therefore I cannot agree with it. But as of now, I have no information on what the prophesies were. Interestingly enough, I went to  urlLink Selectsmart.com's Christian Denomination Selector , which is a "place where you can figure out where your Christian beliefs match up with. This is the simple, clear, and accurate way to examine your beliefs and figure out which Christian denomination would be most appropriate for you." Here, you answer about 20 questions concerning your fundamental beliefs, clikck "show your results", and you are presented with a list of denominations your beliefs line up with, ranked by best match. Here are my top 3 my results:   My #1 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  Christian Denomination Selector  , is  Assemblies of God   My #2 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  Christian Denomination Selector  , is  Church of Christ   My #3 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  Christian Denomination Selector  , is  Eastern Orthodox Church   Eastern Orthodox? Hmmm. Maybe I'll have to check them out. But I really like the church I've been going to, which just happens to be my number 1 result! Wow! I don't have anything else to say. Later, people.
