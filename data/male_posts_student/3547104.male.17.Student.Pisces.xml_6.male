I'm sure Katie C. and my soulMATE Cait know where I'm coming from (Greetings to the rest of the skinny bitches reading this).  Hm. There are a few things I would like to point out: A) Obesity and having excessive amounts of hair, aren't necessarily a rite of passage associated with puberty. It usually just means your destined to spend the rest of your life making love to your hand.  B) Fat people aren't allowed to voice their opinions on others being cocky, because they don't know about it, considering they have nothing to be cocky about.  C) It's not impossible being friends with a cocky person. It might be difficult for those who don't think highly of themselves, but it's definitely not impossible. D) Some fat people shouldn't be taken seriously. They are complete jokes.   PLEASE NOTE: This doesn't apply to all fat people.      This little piggy went to the market, this little piggy stayed home... This little piggy cried wee wee wee all the way home CUZ HE WAS FAT.
