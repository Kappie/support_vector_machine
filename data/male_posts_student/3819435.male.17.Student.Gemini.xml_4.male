Today, Aaron woke up at about 8-ish, took a 30 minutes shower, then left for Crew Call. When Aaron arrived at the auditorium, he was immediately put to work by Mr. Hanzen. Whistling while he worked, Aaron helped his good friend Matt Fejfar build the trap-door in the stage. After this task was completed, Mr. Hanzen asked Aaron to help him move large wooden constructions into the new addition. Following Crew Call, Aaron and his fellow cast members ran through the entire show twice. Aaron was asked to dye his hair black for his role as Willy Willy Wong. It was then time for everyone to go their seperate ways for the night, so Aaron called his dad and was picked up at about 5:45 PM. Aaron and his father then came home, grilled steaks, and watched South Park. All in all, it was a fairly good day for Aaron. "Good night!", moans Aaron as he finishes updating his Blog.
