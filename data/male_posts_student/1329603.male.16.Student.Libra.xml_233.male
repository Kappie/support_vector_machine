His incessant bragging and hinting however does plant the feeling of some chance in my mind - what do I now have to lose?  Anyway. Haven't been feeling very with it today, neither in body nor soul. I'll explain what I mean there - I'm ill and unhappy. Although reading that merits a chuckle from me. I always find it very odd to find myself writing that I am depressed, unhappy, whatever. I feel it inside but I don't really display it that much other than on here... and I tend to wear everything on my sleeve on here. Possibly why according to Zoe my blog is the most 'revealing'. I guess to an extent that's true. You get to know me many times better by reading my blog than through any conversations you may have with me.  Oh, and to clarify, yesterday's lyrics were me-written, they're for a song I'm working on at the moment. Along with about 3 others. Oh well.  Oh, and I've filled out the NYO form. I just need Phil's signature then I can send it off and get an audition in September at Bristol. What's the word? Eep.  Love, Jon Roskilly
