Is kind of a messy story. Mmh, but fun. It al revolves around "EL" as in "the"... EL is Banderas, el mariachi, who's been recruited by Deep's character to bring down a general ( the one that was in love with Carolina, Hayek's character, and then killed her and the baby girl she had with el mariachi ). Now, is up to here where the plot is somewhat easy to follow, then it all gets tangled in a series of plots and personal vendettas that lets you all confused, but the action is non-stop, so you don't care that much about it. There are funny moments, most of them delivered by Deep. I have read that Deep's characterization holds the movie, but I have to disagree. Yes is true that Deep is great and funny, but I sensed a perfect balance between all characters ( maybe too many to care for all of them, but anyway ), even the sexy part of the movie ( Hayek and Mendes ) is balanced, I mean, you get a share of both females and remember both without one overpowering the other. All around, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, is a great popcorn movie, funny, lots of action, and a really good visual adventure. A great addition to this movie, because he delivers some funny moments without being too there is Pedro Armendariz Jr. as the president of Mexico. Funny.  What I could live without is the picture of Mexico as a sandy, hot and full of folklore, much less when most of the action takes place in Culiacan, Sinaloa, a place with a tropical weather, clean and pretty.  ...  Freddy vs. Jason.  Now this one was a movie I was waiting for a long time. Being a guy that grew up on the 80's and being Freddy the cause of many sleepless nights, this was a movie to remember my childhood. Deception? Mmmhhh, not really! Satisfied? Mmmhhh, not really! Ok, lets get clear. This movie has all the elements that most of us remember from the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th movies... And the movie does start with a great opener, then, from there is just killing and fights with not much story. Still, a good flick for an auto-cimena or a Friday night with that special someone. After all, as I always say, you better see for yourself if a movie is good or it isn't.
