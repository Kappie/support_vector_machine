Morning, had tuition. Afternoon, went online. Late afternoon, played  Onimusha 3 . Evening, watched TV. Night, which is now, online again. Haha...  I'm kinda afraid right now. Afraid of getting the results for my trial. Afraid of going to  Genting  next week where I have to stay with strangers. Afraid of another problem which is occurring. But still, I have courage. Sometimes I just feel that life's better if I had done better things, that leads to a better life. Don't get me wrong, I'm still enjoying my life, haha...  ~ Congrats to  Kelvin Kam  for getting into the top 8 for the um... O2Jam tournament held in Penang yesterday. He's qualified for the  national  level which will be held in Kuala Lumpur! Congrats to the 9 newspaper that won the NIE Newspaper 2004. Although we're not one of them, but we tried our best. Congrats to  Zero  for getting a new  girlfriend . Hope you all will have a  steady  and  long-lasting  relationship. Anymore, I think that's all... haha...
