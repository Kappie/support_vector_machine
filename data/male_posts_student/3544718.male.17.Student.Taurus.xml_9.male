Well, I had an awesome night!  We all went bowling!  I am really (and I mean   really)    bad at that game!  I have so much fun playing it though!  I think the highest score that I have ever gotten is like a 98!  hehehe!  Oh, well!  I just hope that I will be able to keep my record of never breaking 100! LOL :)  Well, I must be going now!  I need some sleep so I won't be grumpy... hehehe I will talk to you guys later! God bless and G'night!  Love always,  Kimmy Blunt
