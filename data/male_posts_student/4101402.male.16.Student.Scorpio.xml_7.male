Tuesday sucks because it's not the first, most dreaded day of the week, and it's not the most celebrated day. It's not even the middle of the week. At least on Thursday you can look forward to Friday. Tuesday is a meaningless day, in my opinion.      What I did do was play some more billiards. I'll have you know that I broke my personal 9-ball record: I pocketed the 9 ball on the break. I was pretty happy about that.      Since Murray is dead, I tried to resurrect the ancient Murray in our shed that hasn't been turned on in three years. Of course, it was dead too. I've come to the conclusion that our back yard will never be mowed and that we'll just have to live with a small jungle.      Nothing else to report. Maybe hump day will be better. Later.
