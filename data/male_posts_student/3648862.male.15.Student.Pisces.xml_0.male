But other than that grad. was really boring. My lips really started to hurt after playing the songs over and over again. Then I went to a graduation party for my distant cousin. I met my other distant cousin Tony. He went to the same college I want to go to, Berklee in Boston. It’s a music college, sounds like lots of fun. Then I went to the carnival with my three cousins. I had more fun then I thought I would. I am really tired right now, and I even drank a Redbull. It’s not working though! Ok back to the story.  At first, Goku and Hakkai are facing away from each other in bed. But goku’s stomach mumbles and he flips over. He stairs at Hakkai’s back for a little while thinking of the last time he had pleasure. It was with a boy, about the age of fourteen. Goku thought of it so much he got hard and accidentally poked Hakkai in the back. Hakkai feels the poke and immediately turns over. “ Goku did you just poke me or am I feeling things?” Goku blushes a little “I think your just feeling things” He turns his head still blushing. Hakkai looks at Goku, and Goku looks back at him. Hakkia now starts to blush as he puts his arms around Goku. Hakkai looks down at Goku’s moist lips. Goku closes his eyes and they lock together. Goku moans a little as Hakkai starts to move his hands across Goku’s body. Hakkai then starts to kiss Goku on his neck and goes down the to the middle of his. He then moves his way back up to Goku’s lips. Goku feels the pleasure surging threw his body and he moans again. Hakkai starts to go down to Goku’s neck, but Goku stops him and pulls him back to his lips. Goku starts moving his hands around Hakkai’s body and Hakkai gets goosebumps and shivers a little. Goku then starts to kiss Hakkai on his stomach. Hakkai moans a little “Oh Goku”.  - To be continued in part 3  Leave a comment someone please, I haven’t had a comment in decades. TTYL
