This paper has a kickass topic, but it's not writing itself. Bad paper.  For anyone who's interested, my paper addresses what caused Sadat of my now favorite quote, "I adore [Hitler] from the bottom of my heart." to become the Jew-loving hippy that we were all taught he was in Contemporary World.  Not phrased exactly like that. Though I think that quote is a pretty strong opening sentence.
