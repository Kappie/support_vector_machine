They are so entertaining that i think we must create a     B  LO  G    AWA   R D    to recognise some excellent crap-writer's effort. Of cos, i'm not the only in the jury. In fact all S08s are part of the judging process. As for a start, I'll nominate some nice entries and comments.  nominees for:      B E  S T   EN  TR  Y      1) Ian aka Janet Jackson  Friday, July 09, 2004    What the ****?  I really dun have much to say lor, except... CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, u're just made of wood, CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, u just had to be in the mood... CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, for passing down that "joke" CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, wish i could wash ur mouth with soap... CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, it spread like wildfire without control, CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, i hope the other party din get to know... CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, my reputation has flown the coop, CURSE YOU JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, for revealing my b**bs!   2) Amanda Tuesday, July 27, 2004    giving janet a run for his money!  i write too much, spanning for pages, but I never write enough, i always have more emotions, never expressed,  only felt.  they are the secret emotions that no one talks about, they have no name. they are expressions, lasting for a simple millisecond, before being hidden away, that a thousand words could not describe, that a hundred pictures could not express. sometimes I smile, who knows if its fake or real. then again, who really cares? everyone enjoys false niceties. so they can tell themselves everyone is all right, and justify their walking away, not caring.  maybe its easier that way. pretending you didnt know, that inside she was, no, I was screaming, shouting, hoping to be heard, recognized,  but wearing a mask, with a smile. and knowing that, the milliseconds, when the mask falls off, are ignored.  haha well just felt like putting it up to make a statement that everyone is not what they seem. food for the thought people..  3) Nuria aka nus  -this is for weijian-  ..who by the way is SLACKING at home somewhere in MALAYSIA eating D24 durians and having an itch.wahhh get chicken pox and get sent to m'sia?!that's what i call good life man.when i had chicken pox by the way,I did not go m'sia for one, nor did i get sent to cdc.i was at home applying lots of calamine lotion and looking like a ghost all in white.hey,u noe what..u should share the joy with your lovely classmates in 04s08 who are mugging so hard and being trashed by all the teachers.and u noe HOW u can do that??by popping up in our class for just ONE chem tutorial :) this will not only benefit YOU,the individual,but ALSO has FAR REACHING benefits for US,the society at large.(that line was in my GP essay,couldn't help it.haha) #1. You might infect half the class..meaning we'll have a empty class,which means teachers might cut us some slack and we can give the excuse that "half the class is not here",which means our workload might be lessoned,which means we have more time to write in the blog,which means we'll have a life,which means...... (u get the picture)#2. (this is the best part) You might infect the chem teacher!! HOORAY!! she hasn't got immunity yet,she told us during chem prac.so u are actually doing her some good by GIVING her immunity by infecting her...good eh?2 in one. yup,u know what u have to do ;) -nus       B E S T     C  OM M E N  T S      1) ELS@ (u rock man, i'll support u)  HAHAHAHAHA!!!

Nuria GOH will be very upset if she reads such foul language leh . . . ELSA     2) Nus just a note to everyone, WrITiNG lIkE tHiS is SO NoT cUtE.pls stop it before this whole blog looks like it belongs to some    broken-english  ,  boliao ,brainless    ah lian .thank u.
