Kennedy , and everyone was very excited, except for the Republicans, who make up 70% of the population of my doomed city.  There were about 8,000 people there, and temperatures were near 100. Kerry was late, but we were treated to some fine tracks from Kerry's house DJ, whomever he or she may be. Such classics as  EMF's  "Unbelievable," and "Life is a Highway" by  whoever the fuck sings "Life is a Highway"  boosted spirits and got the surly crowd in the mood for some token stump-speech rhetoric. I was surprised at how lively and forceful Kerry was in person. He is a talented campaigner and he wasn't even heckled. I was there with my good friends  Scott Thorson  and  April Strickland , and we had a fine time, although we were both praying for the sweet taste of high-powered marijuana about halfway through the experience. Strangely enough, there weren't very many filthy hippies there. I guess they don't like Kerry because they reside in a pathetic dream world that is responsible for such entities as  Ralph Nader  voters or non-voters, and these scum are as responsible for the Bush presidency as  Jerry Falwell  and  Satan  himself.  Take a fucking shower and vote for Kerry.   Hurricane Charley  is rolling into Florida, but unfortunately it does not look like the state will sink into the Atlantic and lose most of its electoral votes. Although I'm sure  George and Jeb  would find a way to give fish the right to vote, and vote Republican. Democrats would blunder and only concentrate on getting in manatees because they are more intelligent and care more for social issues.  I would like to thank the cats at  Boards of Canada  for making sweet music and helping me have pleasant dreams last night. It just never gets old.  Hope is on the way.
