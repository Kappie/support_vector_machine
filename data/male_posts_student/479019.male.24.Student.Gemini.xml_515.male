I talked to both Mike and Nancy today on the phone... So if Nancy calls Mike and Cissa her parents... and Nancy calls me her brother... and I'm older than all of them and a friend of Cissa's older sister... that makes a very weird looking boardie family tree.  I want a bluetooth adapter or a data cable for my phone!!!  Funny how the workers at Hong Kong Express recognize me now.  ***
