What, you all think gay people are special just because their gay? NO! It's just a sexual preferance, and I'm sick of this whole fucking world feeling bad for the gay people being picked on, happens to us straight people too you know you disgusting worthless ignorant gay straight alliance. It's not fair, we can say one thing to gay people such as..."Your breathe smells like shit!" and they'd be like "Oh my gawd I'm reporting you!" Then I'd get in trouble but if it was visa versa..."Your breathe smells like cocky!" - Gay guy. And I reported him for some crazy ass reason, he would not get in trouble! NOT FAIR AT ALL! Ok, just wanted to share that analogy I came up with today...or last night while sleeping? No, this morning? I'm not sure when I thought of it but it's the greatest thing I've ever came up with. Nothing extraudinary occured today, and nothing great has occured in the past few days. Boring, I can't until Christmas. Two sweatshirts and a beanie came today, I couldn't wait for Xmas so I opened the POD one w/ the beanie. Now for some odd reason I'm going to run now...I'll be out of breath in no time. I haven't ran since the Spring! Ok that's it. Oh yea, I got Tony Hawk Underground (THUG) and it's awesome. You can run around, skate (obviously) and drive many types of vehicles. Also, just another month or so until my 1 year anniversary for this baby blogger. Woohoo! I'm going to celebrate and give my computer a cupcake... I'll smoosh it into the cd rom drive or just throw it at the monitor screen. Ok that's all.
