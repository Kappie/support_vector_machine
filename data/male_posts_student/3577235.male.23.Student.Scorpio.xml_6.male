Well, I have so many topics I do not want to touch, but this is for me is really sensitive. I know I must be eating too much and too comfortable by doing nothing. I feel I am sick. I really think that this solitude make me feel I am sicker than other people. Probably not. I could read to know that people at my age or close to my age "girl" will be a very hot topic amoung guys. But by leave the group life, I feel I am quite a hyporcitic now. I think I am quite becoming the one that don't really know how to show their feeling! I try to use this as a way to express myself. But no one to share with. I am afraid of people, and the more I try to avoid contact, more I feel I am always belittled by everybody. I feel so painful. I need to find a way to express it. I love girls. I mean the one I know. I don't know, but I do long for a itimate relationship. I've grown up, physically, maybe not mentally, well, definitely not. I do wish having a girl I could hold in my arms, I could hold her hands in mine. I could be friend with her. I could talk to her about everything, I mean everything. And I would like to share secret with her. I long for a girl I could hold so tight and with my head touching her chin, maybe a little kiss on the ear. I told myself a thousand times that I am sick of talking to myself anymore!  I told myself, I love her. I love her. She is in the place I would want her so bad, I, myself, however, am not in a place where I could have her. I love her. And she does not know it. Now, she is back to Japan. Can you believe that the last chance I caught to see her was when I was trying to run up a stair in the student center? She is self sufficent now. Wish her good luck and don't look back.  Everytime come across a pretty girl, I would be like so excited and happy. But everytime, I would to say something, I would like to call her name. You know, I did not have a close relationship with her. I know I did not really love her. I know. But it doesn't matter right now. Why bother? I just want a name I could hold down to. I wish a for girl. But I am not in a place I am able to have one.
