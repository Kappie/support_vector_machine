So, to ease myself, I sat and watched Gladiator with her on my lap...    There are those of you who might take this as a warning to keep me away from small children...    And you may be right...       Inother news, I'm told the trip to NiagraFalls will have to be delayed as Uncle will be in a meeting of some kind...    I suppose that will give me more time to do some Flash...     I doubt it, my aunt will have planned something...    *sigh*    She's downloaded these fairytale stories in Mandarin... Cinderella etc...    And is playing them for the Cousin...    And so obviously I'm the only one who pays any attention, (try that for bored to death...)    I swear, the people who are reading them also do the propaganda films...    After my 6th time of Listening to Cinderella and the Ugly Duckling, I have two question...     Why is  the Ugly Duckling  called that? Wouldn't  the supposed "duckling" which was actually an cygnet , or something along those lines be more, well, accurate? I don't mind if you don't agree with me, it  is  a rather moot point...    Secondly, in  Cinderella , the two step-sisters cut off a toe and a heel (respectively) to fit their feet into the silver shoes, afterwards, the narrator said, and this a translation from Mandarin by me, so I can almost guarantee accuracy (Isn't modesty a wonderful thing?)     "The sisters were so angry at their step-sister that their faces turned white"    That was after the prince's "you're my princess" etc etc  Correct me if I'm wrong, but If you've had your big toe, or heel, cut off, the last thing you'd get a rather white face for would be from anger... Let's see... the pain, or perhaps more likely, the  agony , the blood loss... I just can't see anger being worse than those two... especially combined... But then again... what do I know? :/     I know... I like to argue moot points, that are completely pointless (no pun intended)    Meh...
