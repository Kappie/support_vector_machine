This is a statement of principle in anticipation of the expected debate over same-gender marriage. It is not an endorsement of any specific amendment.  "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints favors a constitutional amendment preserving marriage as the lawful union of a man and a woman."   ......................................  okay.. now i know this is in reference to gay-marriages, but (as has been pointed out in other blogs) this is also statement that supports an amendment that would ban polygamous marriages ( a  man and  a  woman). how can the church do that??? in the late 19th century we (mormons)were crying and protesting that we had the right to have plural-wives, and now we are trying to take that right away from others?
