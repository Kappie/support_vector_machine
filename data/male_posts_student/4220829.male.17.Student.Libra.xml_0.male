I went to see Ellies school play last night- Oliver. I was good, but we got home at 1 in the morning, then I had to wake up at 6 this morning. I don't actually think I should be writing this, so I'll stop and write later.  John  Oh, I thought, for fun, I would post some MSN conversations that I have had in the past, the first i'll post was the three of us on MSN last week. HAHA, what the fuck, i'm going to sleep.  ill do it another time
