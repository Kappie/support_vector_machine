It's a shitload of money though, and 90 percent of the bands suck...eh...I'm gonna think about it...Marty said he would go, and Nick wants to too I think...  I went to the aimee's house today.  We watched Anger Management and Forrest Gump...haha..."I got bit in the butt-ocks"...It was a good time :)  Well, Evan never called because he was busy...gah...  peace
