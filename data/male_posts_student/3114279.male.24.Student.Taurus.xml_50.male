      Happy 4th.  Today I slept in, went swimming and laid by the pool, had a cookout with my family here, drove through town and saw some fireworks, and now I'm watching VH1's 50 worst songs ever I think it's called.  Hope everyone has had a good and safe day.  I keep having Lake City dreams at night.  A few nights ago I dreamt about dozens of people that I haven't seen since high school.  I haven't seen these people or thought about them in more than five years.  I was just surrounded by these people, hanging out with them, and then playing sports with them.  Dozens of people.  What the hell?  And then last night I dreamt about being in Lake City, just going around town or something, and again seeing people I haven't seen and really should have completely forgotten about.  When I woke up, it took me a minute to realize that I'm not in Lake City anymore.  I don't exactly know why I would have these dreams.  I certainly don't miss Lake City, and I haven't thought about some of these people in several years.   Oh wow, Crash Test Dummies "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm," that is a terrible song.  I commented a while back that I wasn't crazy about the Soderbergh version of Solaris.  I picked it up at the used record store for very cheap (and it was brand new, not used!), and watched it again.  Now I have to change my opinion and saw that it is quite good.  Maybe it's because I had only seen it once.  Maybe also because I recently finally saw the original Russian version, and skimmed the Stanislaw Lem book that both films were based on.  The Lem book is very spread out and the Russian film, I think, tried to tackle as much of the book and as many of the themes as it could, while I think Soderbergh pretty much picked one thing and went with it.  I think he picked the strongest theme of the book and the original film, and it really is outstanding.  This is another film that most people I know dislike, possibly because it is so slow moving, I don't know.  I hate it when people claim that the reason that someone didn't like a movie is because "they didn't understand it."  How snobby.  Though, truly, a lot of times that may be the case.  Anyways, this film asks some of the same questions as Vanilla Sky, about memory and reality and whatnot.  But the George Cloony character comes to a different decision in the end than that of the Tom Cruise character.  Tom Cruise chose to wake up from his dream reality and live a real life, which in the past was what I would have most agreed with, where the George Clooney character chose to go into the Solaris planet and live a dream in order to be with his deceased wife (and by the way, Solaris is much better than Vanilla Sky, and the way Solaris shows Clooney's characters decision is much much better).  Really, why is the decision to live in a dream a bad decision?  Why would a "real reality" be better?  Wouldn't a dream reality be just as real?  Would you rather live in the Matrix, or live in the sewers.  What's the difference?  The Matrix is just as real.  By the way, I hate the Matrix.  Maybe I would choose to go into the Solaris planet.  What would you choose, Glenn?    I now have 50 horrible songs stuck in my head, courtsey of VH1.
