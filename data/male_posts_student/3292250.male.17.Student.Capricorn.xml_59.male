I'm thinking something along the same basic size, maybe more of a rim. I was looking at some Armani the other day at Lenscrafters, so I'll see how Mom reacts to designer eyewear. I am a label queen after all. Lets see, it (was) the first full day of my new "I'm going to get my sorry ass in shape" plan and I've kinda broken. Had pizza (from Papa John's no less) for lunch and Bob Evan's for dinner, complete with Peanut Butter Cup Sunday. So I should really walk for close to 2 hours this evening to make up for it, or maybe noon-time and evening if it isn't too hot.  I've got some links for y'all. Check out the most recent issue of  urlLink  Chicago  magazine  for the Top 20 Singles list. A blog acquaintance of mine,  urlLink Jake S. , made the list as one of two openly gay singles in Chicago. Much congrats to Jake for that.  From another blog I read,  urlLink Andy Towle  provides  urlLink this link  that I found particularly hilarious. Also from Andy, some pics of  urlLink Heath Ledger  from the set of  Brokeback Mountain . That's all for now. Keep busy people. Boredom leads to a backyard performance of  West Side Story , or is that just me?
