In the night sky are three moons, each carrying its own evil grin toward me, along the city streets lie animals in cages, possessed by an evil force as is each building, only the mortar stop it from escaping. I have a pewter staff though, on one side is the Christian Cross engraved; another shows Father Time - I cover the staff in a dark liquid and then this repels the evil; the three moons shrink in to one; the animals return to their normal form and the buildings return to their previous inanimate state. The Longboat continues to sail around the city and gradually the howling of wolves stop as I use my staff to repel evil.   Eventually the longboat makes one final turn and it hits a black wall, the wall doesn't smash the boat; instead it splits in half letting us pass through and only then do I realize that its just a fair ground ride. So to today, or this evening more importantly; with less than an hour left my prom date confirmed that she would be going to the prom and subsequently, I got changed and in due course, got to the venue. I played my part as a gentlemen better than ever but she just didn't seem interested me. She even left without informing me and so I too left and found myself watching Paul McCartney at Glastonbury, ending his set with Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [the reprise].  We're Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band We hope you have enjoyed the show Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band We're sorry but it's time to go. Sergeant Pepper's lonely. Sergeant Pepper's lonely. Sergeant Pepper's lonely. Sergeant Pepper's lonely. Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band We'd like to thank you once again Sergeant Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band It's getting very near the end Sergeant Pepper's lonely Sergeant Pepper's lonely Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. My life has a habit of playing songs to be ironic at me. Oh well, I guess that might be the last time I see her, so is the way of puppy love.  Well good luck to everyone else as I seem to be out of it. I'll end this with irony;   We're sorry but it's time to go.
