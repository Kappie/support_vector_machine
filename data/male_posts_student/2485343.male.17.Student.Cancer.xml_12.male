It is seriously ridiculous, especially when the person doesn't know you. Oh, but they think they know you. They are for sure about that. As you can tell, I have a low tolerance for ignorance.  Well...I have been reading several books recently and I'd have to say that I haven't been so engulfed in a book before like I have been this one. The book is called "Breathing Underwater" by Alex Flinn, and i suggest you go pick it up. It is a very good read.
