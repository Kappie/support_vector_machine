So, anyways, I had a great time though, Aileen, Angela, Lennie, and Mike came over and we watched "You Got Served".  Well, besides the movie, it was great =).  We had lumpy, cold sushi, and burnt popcorn.  Haha, afterwards though, we went to Dairy Queen and I got a Moolatt√©.  Meh, I don't see the hype connected to that drink.
