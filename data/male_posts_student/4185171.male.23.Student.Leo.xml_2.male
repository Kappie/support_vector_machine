Now many of you that know me well will say that I do it a lot for someone who doesn't really like dating.  True enough.  But I date more out of necessity than desire.  I like being comfortable with someone and having a relationship with them, but getting to that point most often requires some form of "dating".  Both parties have to get all dolled up to impress the other.  We have to look nice, but not too formal.  One wouldn't want to scare the other party into thinking one is a stiff.    I guess I could deal with the dressing up part.  I like dressing and clothing in general, but what really gets me about dating is the smalltalk.  I'm not good at it.  When I first meet someone I can honestly say that one of the first things that goes through my head is not, "Good lord, this girl is so hot.  I just gotta know what her favorite movie is..."  But that's what people do to fill the gaping holes in conversation that can't yet be filled with relavent information.  I can't really talk about the kind of progress I made on one of my Xbox games on the first date, for example.  I have to talk about what kind of work I've done, schooling I've completed, my family.  Now all of these things are important granted, but a telling someone I'm a chemist is not really a great jumping off point for conversation with a large majority of the population.  It's a shame, but it's true.    I say these things of course because I did have a date of sorts this afternoon.  Not that I was looking for one, but I got one.  I met her at the previously described party.  Seems nice enough.  Things seemed to go well.  I guess it must be my natural charm or something.  They went well enough to meet up again tonight.  Which is fine.  Might as well get all of the awkwardness out of the way as soon as possible.      I am bleeding from my face right now which isn't going to help me out tonight.  I thought was just picking away some of the skin that was still peeling from my Hiroshima like sunburn, but evidently I had taken the plug off of the end of my aortic artery.  Why do cuts from the face always produce so much blood?  I think I do a pretty good job of keeping my head elevated above my heart...    Tomorrow I have my first scheduled commitment at USC since I arrived in California.  It's an informal lunch.  Just a little get together with other incoming first year grad student.  I've already documented my fears about other these other students.  It's only worse that it is an informal setting.  That means more small talk.  It's like going on multiple dates at once.  Horrible.  I don't even want to think about how many times I'm going to hear the phrases, "Where are you from originally?", "Where are you living now?", and "What made you choose USC?"  Guh...
