I am a lazy bum....I plead guilty as charged right here in this Ford Explorer chair....but dammit I'm a happy lazy bum....  I made a nice sausage pizza and made a huge mess I probably won't ever clean up and I'm content....  I am in full bachelor form....my house is a mess but the mess is such that a few tosses here, a little running water there, and a once over with the dust devil and I'm good to go in case of ummm...guests and such....  What a life!
