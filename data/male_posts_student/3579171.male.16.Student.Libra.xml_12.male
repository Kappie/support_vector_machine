If you look at it as keeping my end, it's been working out great.  If you look at it as seeing how many people actually want to talk to me, not that great.  I can easily count the number of people that actually IMed me  and  how many times they did on one hand.  Actually, it's not that surprising.  Remember my earlier post?  Where I write about the number of friends I have?  Yeah, taking that number and this new number, it's actually understandable.  Anyway, now that the fourth of July/July 4th is over, everybody seems to be posting about their adventures on that day.  So, I decided I should be a follower again and do that also.  Here's my post about my adventures on July 4th:  On July 4th, I did... absolutly nothing.  I probably sat online waiting for people to IM me for over 10 hours.  Okay, well maybe not 10 hours that's exagerating, only 9 hours and 59 minutes.  I didn't want to be that much of a loser waiting online for 10 hours.  Besides that, I guess I just slept or watched tv.  Basically, I did on July 4th exactly what I do everyday.  Intersting, huh?  Since my last post was horrendously short, I am trying to make this post horrendously long.  Well, not  horrendously  long but longer than the last one.  Hmm, now that I look at it, this post is already longer than the last one... I guess I'll just end it here than.  Hope you enjoyed your forth of July as much as I enjoyed mine... maybe more.  Actually, before I go I want to congratulate two of my stalker friends for  finally  getting with their stalk-ees.  - Some loser   "Once a loser, always a loser." -Who knows?
