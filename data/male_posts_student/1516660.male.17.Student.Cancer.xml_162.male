I called once, and nobody picked up. Fine. People are usually too sleepy to pick up phones. So, I decided to call 2 phones instead (house and her handphone). Ha! It took me about like 5 minutes of calling two phones to wake her up. And, she's already woken up lor, by my SMS I sent earlier. She's just too lazy to pick up the phone. I was like "Woah! I can't believe you can tolerate two phones ringing for 5 minutes!". Super man!  After that, went to 883 to eat breakfast with Mom (I ate laksa, she ate mee siam). Then, upon coming back, I decided to play FFIX for awhile. Oh yes! I long time never do FFIX Updates hor!!! I basically went to the Black Mage Village, then procedded on to the Desert Palace. I have to select Freya, Steiner and Armarant to go to Oleivert with me, a non-magical place. Sigh! There goes my black magic and white magic characters! Darn! Then, the next door neighbour came and talked to me about O Levels and the importance of choosing the correct path. I appreciate her opnions and I know she meant well, but she made me almost late for meeting with manda. I ended the convo, then get dressed hurriedly and went off.  I met Amanda there. She had brought some milk, butter and chocolate flakes. We then waited for Andi and went down to meet him. The three of us went to Chun's house together.   We met Wendy and Chun downstairs, and we went up. We were soon joined by MeiYing. We started fixing the puzzle! Oh my! I originally decided to fix Piglet, but don't know how to due to the little number of Piglet pieces. I decided to fix Christopher's head instead. After doing that, I went to fix some minor pieces here and there. We finally completed after an hour! Woah! 3 hours ahead of what we originally planned! We wrote our messages to Arman on the back of the board. HaHa! I hopes he likes it! Then, we ate some yam cake there (oh good! got mushroom inside! nice!) and listened to some songs (Disney and BackStreet Boys).   After that, we went to Arman's house. Me and manda detoured back to Chun's house to collect our ingredients! e left it behind...hahaha! At Arman's house, we just relaxed there lor. We played with his cat, rid on his exersing bike machine (for 5 mins maintaing a constant rate of 70 rates per minute), and gossipped. We gossipped about butts. HaHaHa! Just because I noticed butts and compared them doesn't mean I have a fetish hor! Ha! Well, we discussed CQ's and WQ's butt. Ha!!! And Amanda and I pretended to discuss Wendy's butt and lead her to misbelieve that we gossipped about her butt. HAHA! Wendy, if you are reading this, :P!  Then, leh, we left and went to Woodlands MRT to wait for our friends so we can go to Yvonne's house. We waited for Ah Ji, WQ and Clar. When Ah Ji saw Andi, his expression changed lor. I knew it from the start (I got this feeling when we are taking the bus to Woodlands Interchange lor....as his friend, I know these things!) that Ah Ji would become like that lor. But I don't blame him. He hasn't seen Andi without Faiz yet. Andi is basically very nice and funny. Yeah! And I think Ah Ji realized that as time goes by. I saw him chuckling at Andi's jokes quite a number of times. That's good. Yeah!  Once everyone got together, we proceeded to Yvonne's house. I talked to Ah Ji about what I told you yesterday. Yeah. He said in the end "You are crazy". I don't know what he meant by that comment lor. Perhaps he meant what I am doing about this situation. I must go ask him next time.   We assembled all ingredients to make the cake. And they found out that they don't have enough flour. So, they decided to play open number to send an unlucky soul down to 888 to buy flour. And it was me. If I had known, I should have shown a 3 (and made Amanda buy) or a 1 (and saboed CQ). I made the trehcerous walk (okay...not really that long la, but under the sun leh! and i sweat easily!) to and fro 888. I brought a packet of plain flour costing $1.40. I finally made it back. Later leh, I found out that they found out they have enough flour. but it was too late, they sent me out le (ever heard of calling? i can always walk back). But in order not to waste my efforts, they used the flour I brought instead. Thanks guys! HaHa! We freased and floured the pan and poured the cake mix (I missed the exciting part!) into the pan. We put the pan into the pre-heated oven and waited for 45 minutes. We played Murderer there. HaHa! I keep being the vicitm! I been the police once (and i sucked at it! I got all my suspects wrong!) and a murderer once too (I only managed to kill XiaoXi! I tried to kill Manda, but she was the police! HAHA!). The cake was finally done! It was cute, in a way. We decorated it with whipped cream and flakes. We then decided to send it over to SuPing personally.   First, we went to 888 to buy a box to contain the cake. Then, we walked to the bus-stop to take the bus there. We took 913 and walked a bit (We were shown an "attraction", Faiz's house. Bastard.) to get to her house. We rang her doorbell and there she comes! We sang SuPing the birthday song first, then showed her the cake. She was very happy and invited us in to eat. We finally got to taste our own creation! I gotta admit, it was nice! Our first time baking a cake, and it turned out nice! Wee! SuPing was elated and kept thanking us! Then, I rushed down to meet my family at 768 to eat.  After eating, we came back home and watched Holland V and Comedy Nite. Then came online. SuPing thanked me again, I chatted with Wendy, XC and Shin Han! And then I wrote this blog! Such an eventful day! Oh well. Gotta go liao. See ya tomorrow!
