I did write the speech at 3:00 am and no I didn't have any time to practice or sleep but I did get the only A and so far I have gotten an A on everything in that class.. I am such a stud.. just had to tell someone about.. I hope everyone the same god grades as I have been getting..  and lets just hope those grades go for my other classes as well...  "I am a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it." - Thomas Jefferson..   A pretty smart dude so I must be working pretty hard..    I'm out..
