Some are quite old... But all are japanese manga... Buying comics is very addictive... But it's good... As, it makes you creative... I love to read mangaone of the reasons why i read them is because of it's storyline... Like 'Battle Royale' the manga for example... I don't buy it as it is abit sadistic, but I buy it because it has a very good storyline... BTW, it(the manga) is rated MATURE... Which is for ages 18 and above... For it's very sadistic scenes, and the language spoken by it's characters... In every book, someone will always say "FUCK!"... It is sadistic like the movie... There's a scene(in the movie) where a head was sliced of with sword... And the head was used as a weapon... That scene made me puked out my lunch... Anyway, the Battle Royale manga can be bought for S$20 a book(there are 14 books) at the shop ABSOULUTE COMICS in bugis... People who like to read manga published by Tokyo Pop should know where it is...  Today, my tuition class was very boring... We had a relieve teacher instead of the Mr. lu guy... The relieve teacher kept on talking in a very very monotonous tone... Most of us were damn bloody pissed... The guy beside my was pointing the middle finger at the teacher when she was writing on the board... We had another girl joined our class today... Finally, we had abit more girls joning our class... My class has 5 guys and 2 girls currently... All the guys are from all boys school... Which usually explains the excessive amount of dirty jokes in my tuition class...  There are a lot of things i don't wanna remember about today... So, this will be the end of this post...  I really wished that my life had a Reset button....
