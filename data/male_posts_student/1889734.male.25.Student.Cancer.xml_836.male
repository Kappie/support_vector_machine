New England Republican compared a video of an interview by Tom Brokaw with President Bush, then compared it to the transcript.  Take a look at this sample (bold items were excised from the video).  Brokaw: “And you were not greeted as liberators like Vice President Cheney said that you would be.”  Bush: “Well, I think we've been -- let me just -- I think we've been thanked by the people of Iraq.  And I think you'll hear more of that from people like Prime Minister Alawi and the foreign minister, who both have repeatedly, ‘Thank you for what you've done, and by the way, help us.’   “It's not easy work to take a country from tyranny to a free society.  And we'd been there a little over a year. And it's-- you might recall if you're looking for parallels in World War II, it took about four years to get an active reconstruction effort going.  “And in my speech that you referred to, I make-- pointed out that in the immediate aftermath of World War II, there was a-- the Soviet Union exploded a bomb, that China went communist. It was a question of whether or not the Greek government would go communist.  “The reconstruction effort was halting at best. The marshal plan hadn't been started. And I-- my only point is, these are difficult assignments. It was a difficult assignment then. It's a difficult assignment now. And what America must do is understand the consequences of getting it right. And the consequences of getting right is that  a free society in the Middle East is going to help change the country, change the countries in the Middle East and make us more secure and the world more peaceful.”  Remember this next time you see a taped interview of the President.  They don't seem to have a problem taking out portions of his answers that might actually help bolster his case for going into Iraq.
