People usually talk about Irvington, Newark, and sometimes East Orange (hell even Orange!) in tones that lead you to think they are some of the roughest towns in the country (while in reality they may be the toughest in... the county! harharhar).  So, assuming I'm not married by the time I'm 25 (I do intend to get married younger then my dad did, which was 27), actually let me rephrase that, assuming I'm not married to a non-black person, I really KNOW I'm going to be living in a place like that.  My mom was explaining the whole process, she grew up in Maplewood and her and her other black friends from Maplewood went through the same process.  Get out of college, move to Newark/East Orange/Irvington or some other black people enclave, then work your way out and move to South Orange, West Orange, Somewhere else in Newark/East Orange, or Montclair.  It's a really interesting process, and hopefully it'll keep me from falling into the rut that alot of kids who live a life of privelege fall into (which is the slap in the face after college when you need to try and maintain your old lifestyle).    Infact, I'm willing to bet most black people's parents lived elsewhere before they moved to South Orange or Maplewood.  Anyone wanna take me up on that?
