I have an AP test in 2 days...the second hardest test offered....what is the test you ask? AP U.S History....aww yes....guess what sleeping prevented me to do? yes, yes, yes, that's right...STUDY.  I'm not angry though, just disapointed that i couldn't get more done today.   I wanted to go to the gym, study, waste time..you know, the usual...SPEAKING OF THE GYM..  Let me just say something.  Like, last year, i thought i "worked out".  I had some wieghts in my room and shit, and occasionally i "worked" out my muscle's.  If anything, i did get SOMETHING out of it, but i think my ego was the thing getting worked out the most.  Then Andy started his quest for S.E.A.L> perfection.  I went along on the magic carpet ride, but not fully.  And even though i'm not really at the level he is, it's god damn crazy to think where i started.  I look in the mirror, and, i don't know, it's so rewarded.  It's like having a baby.  You see, when people start working out (this DEFINITLY included me) they don't really know what to do.  I for one, knew acouple of things, but not as much as i do now.  Lemme just say this people.   You have to want it to get it.   When i started out, sure i was intimidated, thats what usually keeps people away from the gym.  That kept me away for awhile.  But, as funny and retarted as this sounds, i decided to get Fitness made simple......now, at first, this seemed like a bad buy, like, all it is is him doing is workout's at the gym.  But, you then realize the point of this video.  It TELLS you all the workouts, how to do them correctly, what your suppose to feel.  That definitly got me in the gym.  I got in there, acutally KNOWING more than like 2 excercises.  Anyway, after that, i started  and couldn't stop.  O, byu the way, another problem people have is not rechognizing good pain from bad when they first start working out.   I learned the hard way, but u can always ask someone.  Anyway, ya.  As i look in the mirror, i almost want to cry....No, i'm not being self-centered, i'm just fucking glad i started to work out.  It gives you a whole new reason to live.  You become more out going, you wear tighter close, ya know, try to get noticed more, it's just a whole body transformation.  What tops it is the fact that you r own sweat made it possible. I'm not saying i'm the most jacked person alive, i'm just saying i've made huge leaps and bounds to wear i was at.  Like, my MAX bench press back then was like 150....it's like 210 now (well, last time i did it it was 190, but i did three of those, so i'm guestimating).  I mean, lol, i know this is weird, but it really is incredible.  Anyway, i urge any of you if your reading thisto atleast try it out.  Whatever you feel, just know, EVERYONE at the gym as felt that before.  Pretty much no one is gonna make fun of ya, and if they do, you got MAD people backing you up, so don't even sweat that.  Just get in there, and FUCKING WORK IT!  ...ya, sorry about that, i had to share...I've noticed i started a song below this entry...The Flower....lol, ya.  THe song was inspired by Jorge mainly.  Lemme just start off by saying,  since i've known jorge, which prolly goes back to about 6th grade...he's been catching shit.  Like, not just anyshit, the think, stinky, hard shit.  And  nobody  should catch shit of any sort to begin with.  Anway, for some reason, i just felt like wrting a semi-inspirational song.   I think this was after i read His blog.  Just a whole bucnha old feelings came back and shit, so yeah, i thought i owed em' one.  Didn't finish it yet, but i will. On the subjects of freinds, lemme just say people, thanks for sticking around.  Our lives would be severly different if we didn;t know about it.  I mean, i'll give you aexample of a KEY freind to us all, Rob.  Imagine is we didn't know rob.  I'm sure alot of people don't realize this, but he's been there through ALOT.  Jorge introduced me to rob by the way.  But i mean, just think about it.  We would have prolly NEVER heard about antioch.  Jorge and andy would probably have NEVER met there g/f's, we would have never made all these new frinds, i wouldn't have gone to prom, and just a countless amount of other things.  I don't know what you guys can say for me, i doubt i've really been as importnat as some others, but still, life would be different.  We each bring our own style to the table.  We represent everything in society.  We are the Ying to each others yang. i think it's safe to say we complete each other.  It might come across gay, but shit man, i think it's safe to say we love each other.  We may not admit it, but come on, it's a great freindship we all share.  Agree with me, or not, no difference, this is just coming from me though.  I guess the main idea of the paragraph is to say, that we should all try to keep it this way, we should stop the gossip, stop the critisism, and just try tosaty cool.  I mean, think about it, we only have about a year left together before everyone goes and starts a new life in college! ONE MORE YEAR....i never though i'd be saying that....i'm sure it's worst for the seniors.  But ya, come on people, let's make this a year to remeber!  i ran out of shit to say.  My day...ehh....just over average, and my love life? still non existent......what a wonderful world :o)
