Where did the extra verse in the Zimmerman version of the Birthday song come from? I began to think about once again, the decided to some research. Through this research I found out some interesting things I did not know before. The one thing I did not find though was the answer to my original question. I, like many others, believe the original song was created by the Hill sisters right here in the good ol' state of Kentucky. Wrong. The wrote a song with the melody in 1893, but the lyrics for "Happy Birthday to You" first appeared in a book in March of 1924. No one knows who actually wrote the lyrics. Soon, a third Hill sister sued becasue the song was to similar to the original and she won copyrights to the song. Who knew? I know I didn't. But by asking one question I found out a wealth of information I didn't know before.   Now, wecan get back to more important topic. Where exactly did this mystery verse come from. I've asked around and no one I know even knew this extra verse existed, let alone sing it. I assume most of you readin this have also done this. Now, I have a challenge for you. Before the next time we sing this song, which is May 10th, we must figure out where it came from. It must be answered. I can not go through life with out the answer to this simple question. I'm tired of getting looks everywhere I go just because I sing an extra verse to the Birthday song. Haha. Any information is greatly appreciated!   Clap your hands for Jesus.
