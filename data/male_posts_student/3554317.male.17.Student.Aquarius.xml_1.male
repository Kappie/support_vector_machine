Saturday I got to hang out with a couple of them because they were closing up at a sandwich shoppe down the street.  Since I'm not going to Gen Con anymore I don't have much to look forward to this summer, except for maybe seeing Modest Mouse.  Need to get myself a ticket for that event.  Need to get myself back to Borders and go on a manga buying binge.  I realize this is the upside to having a job, buying whatever, whenever.  I miss people, places, and things.
