And my father solved the problem I had with Adobe Illustrator, so I could finally finish the cat is was vectorising... I don't know if you know the one I mean, but it is the one from the poster of  le chat noir , of  Rodolphe Salis .  So what did I do the past few days whitout my dear deeaaar computer? I read some comic books (again) such as  De Cartografen ,  Roxalane  and some albums of  Storm . Another thing I did, was watching some DVD's I wanted to see again,  The meaning of Life  (yes, I know, again...), some episodes of  Blackadder  (the complete second series, and the first two episodes of the third).
