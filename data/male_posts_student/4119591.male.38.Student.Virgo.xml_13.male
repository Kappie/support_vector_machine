Spike Lee is suing Viacom (owners of the New  urlLink TNN ) over their choice of name for their revamped guy-oriented channel: Spike TV. A name like that could only lead people to assume that Spike Lee is involved (in someone's mind) and so Mr. Lee is having a  urlLink litigious  cow.  Honestly, when I heard about Spike TV for the first time, I thought of the late Spike Jones. Spike Jones Jr. has  urlLink weighed  in on the side of Viacom. Jones was named Spike at birth and would rather not have someone named Shelton Jackson Lee lay claim to exclusive use of Spike.
