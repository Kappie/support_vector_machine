Also ive noticed when working with sockets perl and other languages are quite agressive such as  my $listen = IO::Socket::INET->new(Proto => 'tcp', 				   LocalPort => 9192, 				   Listen => 1, 				   Reuse => 1) or die $!;  "Reuse => 1) or die $!;" thats the main bit in that if you missed it, time to go watch dazed and confused
