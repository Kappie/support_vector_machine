And I've worked out how many different subjects I've done. 14 subjects. Look:  English Language English Literature Chemistry Biology Physics Music Geography Business studies Maths Resistant materials German Statistics Short course religious studies Short course I.C.T.  I've also done an OCR Level 2 certificate in Enterprise, and err.. I could have done better in everything. I've still got a chance with physics and statistics, but Biz (50% of it) is tomorrow, the final 25% on Monday. I 'could' have done better- but I didn't revise properly. Iv been revising the night before, or on the dinner time. I just simply haven't had the time. I could not have imagined having 2 exams a day like last week. The enterprise thing was last year, but if I add all the last few weeks exams up it is exactly: 1955 minutes, or 32.6 hours, or more than 1 day and a quarter of examness, 22 exams.  I've had a shit day. I've never known a day so boring, and uneventful! I have lost the will to live...  It's Fothers 16th coming up, so were going to pizza hut on friday. Sando has just asked everyone if they'll go to his for a BBQ on friday. He didn't know about Fothers. Poor Sando.  Now I'm off to watch  Coronation Street , then I'll have a skim through the 4, 1hr 45 each, practice exams I have...
