I may also have a new job this one will be a job I get paid for so I am looking forward to that, but got to go to an interview thing on Monday for it and I also have an interview for 6th form on Monday too so that will be an interesting day, thatâ€™s about it for now.  See ya  Dan :)  Current mood: Accomplished  Current music: Stereophonics - Lying in the sun
