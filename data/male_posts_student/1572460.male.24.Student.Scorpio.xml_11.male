"Diseases are the tax on pleasures"    - John Ray 1627-1705, British Naturalist    January 10, 2003   The day I began my life as an IDDM patient will be unforgettable. Although Dr. Gokhale almost confirmed me as a Type-I diabetic, he, more than anybody else, still had every reason to believe that it was important for me to consult a specialist doctor, specifically speaking - an  urlLink endocrinologist . He referred me to Dr. Shrirang Godbole, an endocrinologist sub-specializing in diabetes mellitus. Things had to be done quickly if I were to bring my blood glucose levels under control, and if that wasn’t easy enough a task initially for a newly-diagnosed patient, there was more pressure to follow - I had only 15 more days with me before I was to leave for Colorado, and this is practically very little time to receive any form of diabetes education, leave alone grasping every bit of it and acting accordingly to get your sugars down.  I spent close to 4 hours with Dr. Godbole, and without a hint of over-exaggeration, it was the toughest tête-à-tête with a doctor I have ever had. First of all, he did not waste much time in declaring me a Type-I patient, based on all the medical information I provided, and that effectively put to rest any more speculations on the type of diabetes I was suffering from. In a sense, I was almost relieved; there were no more shades of doubt. I can still recollect, although a bit vaguely, the first few statements that Dr. Godbole made. There was no affectation in his voice; he seemed to me, to be one of those doctors who usually do not mince words to state the obvious medical facts. There was a subtle ruthlessness with which he diagnosed me; he spoke with utter non-chalance, but displayed panache and supreme confidence at the same time. I remember him asking me - “Do you wish to live the next 15 years?”. As rhetorical as a question this may seem, I still had to blurt out a “Yes”, (I believe I was expected to), and considering my emotional state of mind during that period of time, those words stung me alright. “Here comes the taskmaster...”, I thought.  The next few hours were like sitting through a crash course in one single go; the course primarily dealing with imparting whatever little diabetes education and awareness that was possible in the short time, and then mentally preparing me for the possible big hurdles ahead as an IDDM patient, especially since in a matter of 15 days I was to start dealing with it all by myself, independently, in an environment pretty much alien to me. I had no time to experiment with different forms of treatment, which I would have normally undergone, if not for my trip back to the USA on the 25th, and an insulin intensive treatment was the only form of survival. Fortunately, I wasn't really a novice when it comes to knowing about diabetes; it pretty much runs in our family and I had a fair idea about the complications. The fact that I call this as “fortunate” wasn't much of a comforting factor at that point of time, but I was certainly not short of resources (in the form of close family members and friends) who would help me to tackle this disease. My side of the conversation with Dr. Godbole was quite shamefully, limited only to frequent “head-nodding”, and an occasionally interspersed “Yes” and “No”. I was not only expected to admit that I understood every word the doctor spoke, but also throw questions at him. The hardest part to grasp was the  urlLink Time Activity Profiles  of insulin – which I would realize later on, was an extremely important aspect in case of Type-I patients to effectively achieve safe levels of blood glucose, and a fact, which if not understood well, could play havoc with your sugars -  urlLink Hypoglycaemia  (or Hypoglycemia) being a prime example. A time activity profile indicates how and at what time insulin starts acting in your body to control your sugars, based on when you deliver yourself an insulin shot, how much you deliver, and the type of insulin you are using. It appeared that there was far too information to know and awfully less time to think over it or discuss it with others. If I am asked to summarize what I learnt in those tense moments at the clinic, I would hardly be able to answer. Nevertheless, I was brainstormed on all the ABCs: diets, exercise, insulin (the “buzz” word for a Type-I), and taking care 24 hours a day - 7 days a week, plus a host of other encyclopedic information and terms pertaining to diabetes.  I left the clinic in a daze with another sleepless night awaiting me.   January 11, 2003   I was prescribed the premixed  urlLink Humulin 70/30 insulin , manufactured by  urlLink Eli Lilly and Co.  using  urlLink recombinant DNA technology (rDNA) . All I can say is hats off to the biochemistry.  I had to administer two shots daily, one before breakfast in the morning (22 units), and one before dinner at night (14 units). A person from Eli Lilly came home to demonstrate the use of the  urlLink Insulin Pen . The pen is a truly remarkable advancement for delivering insulin and gone are the days when people had no option but to resort to painful ways of delivering a shot using a syringe and a vial. The lighweight, pocket-sized, disposable pens come prefilled with insulin and use a fine needle. The pens function almost similar to fountain pens filled with ink. Once you master the technique of delivering shots all by yourself, it is virtually painless.  The morning of January 11, I prepared myself for the first insulin shot of my life. Although the propsect of administering a shot on your own is not the most welcoming, having seen my dad doing it every day for quite a few years, I tried to stay calm. The shot has to be delivered in the subcutaneous layer (and not intra-veinous or intra-muscular), either on the abdomen, thighs or arms. I dialed the dose of 22 units on the pen, but hesitated when I pinched whatever little skin/flesh I had on my abdomen. After a momentary case of “nerves” and “shakiness”, I gathered my might and injected the needle, pushed the plunger, felt the 22 units surge under the flesh, released the skin, held the needle for 10 more seconds and then removed it. That's the way you do it, and surprisingly, I did it perfect the first time. Better still, there was absolutely no pain. Easy, I thought. But not quite. This was only occasion #1. The problem when you initially deliver shots if you are insulin-dependent, is that you have lost lots of weight, fat that is. Finding an appropriate place on your body (a fleshy area) for the shot is a job in itself. Its easy to make a mistake, and inject in a vein or an area close to a vein. Moreover, the injection site needs to be roated at all times, because injecting at the same spot repeatedly, causes tissue damage. I realized that I was quickly running out of areas with enough fat on my body, and experiencing pain thus became a routine, almost a necessity for getting accustomed to more pain. And then delivering a near perfect shot is impossible at all times, what with “nerves” and “shakiness” adding to the woes in the first couple of weeks. I still run out of injection sites on my body, but then pain is the last thing I worry about. As a matter of fact, after close to 8 months of injections twice a day, and making almost 500 tiny little holes in the skin, each of 29-gauge thickness, pain is really not a “feeling” anymore. Quite amusing, isn't it?    Insulin for Dummies     Disclaimer: I provide this information only for the insanely curious. This information might not be 100% accurate and is solely based on my knowledge and understanding. Although I am a self-confessed and self-proclaimed doctor for my diabetes, I would advise you to be your own doctor with yours, and not base any critical decisions on my write ups. Adjusting the dose of insulin is no child's play and you don't want to regret until its too late.   70/30 in simple terms means combining or mixing two types of insulin and using it as one, to control blood sugars over a longer period of time (generally over 12 to 15 hours). The 70% component (human insulin isophane suspension) is a cloudy/milky suspension and is the intermediate-acting insulin, whereas the 30% component (human insulin injection) is a clear liquid and serves as the short-acting insulin. The two are in a premixed form and appear uniformly cloudy similar to skimmed milk.     Short-Acting or The 30% Component   The onset of the short-acting insulin begins 30 minutes after the shot is delivered, which means it takes 30 minutes for the 30% component to start working. Technically speaking, short-acting insulin enters the blood stream within 30 to 45 minutes. For those who wonder why I insist on eating a meal (breakfast/dinner) 30 minutes after injecting myself, this explains why. The peak action is observed between 2 to 3 hours, which is when the insulin has its strongest effect. Thus the 30% component controls my post-breakfast blood glucose. It generally stays effective for a duration of 3 to 6 hours.     Intermediate-Acting or The 70% Component   In case of the 70% component, the onset of action is 2 to 4 hours, i.e. the intermediate-acting insulin enters the blood stream within 2 to 4 hours. It reaches its peak anytime between 4 to 10 hours after the injection. Now this explains how the 70% controls my post-prandial (post-lunch) sugars, since I have my lunch 4 to 5 hours after delivering the shot (or say 4 hours after breakfast), and that is when its peak action starts. And since intermediate-acting insulin stays effective for 10 to 16 hours, it also controls my blood sugars in the evening (supper), until dinner. By the time I take my dinner, the morning insulin dose has almost lost all its effect, and hence the need for another shot pre-dinner to control my post-dinner as well as night time and early morning sugars. But since more than half the time between dinner and breakfast next morning, is spent sleeping, I needed a lesser dose (14 units). And whereas the morning dose covered my three meals: breakfast, lunch, as well as supper; the pre-dinner dose would have to cover only one meal (dinner).  Although these time activity ranges seem too wide, they have been based on clinical trials and prove that insulin time activity profiles show large variations with respect to the intensity and timing. Hence the peak action and effectiveness for a person using the same insulin could be entirely different. These variations are based on the amount of dose, site of injection, the person's physical activity, temperature etc. There is an interesting bit of fact about diabetics facing serious medical problems if they spend a lot of time in hot tubs or saunas or if they indulge in excessive physical activity with an incorrect insulin dose and insufficient amount of food intake. I quote a paragraph from an article that was recently published on the  urlLink American Diabetes Association  website:   “When your whole body gets overheated, your heart tries to increase the blood flow to your skin to get rid of some of the extra heat you have absorbed from the water or steam. If you use insulin to control your diabetes, you may find that this increased blood flow to the fat (where you inject your insulin) increases the rate at which the insulin is absorbed. So a dose of a longer-acting insulin that is intended to last throughout the night will be absorbed much more rapidly. This causes low blood sugars during the hours after you get out of the tub”.     Grappling with the Hypo and the Hyper    Insulin successfully brought my blood sugars down to acceptable levels, if not in the desired range at all times. I had to grapple with once in a while high sugars (hyper) as well as low sugars (hypo). I checked my blood sugars using the glucometer on January 13, the first time since I went on insulin. My Fasting sugar level in the morning read a perfectly normal 79. Was I thrilled? There was no doubt that insulin WOULD work, it HAD to; but to get to know the exact results is even better. It's like getting a stamp of approval, and indicated that I was on the right track. But before I got a chance to celebrate an early victory, I fared poorly in the post-lunch test on the same day. My sugar read 319, and I was back to my usual ritual of retrospection. Did I get my diet wrong? Did I administer the correct dose? I did not really press my panic buttons, and after consulting my doctors, I was told that the body may react unusually during the first few days until it adapts itself to the insulin, a man-made chemical, literally. The body's natural reaction is to ring alarm bells when it finds something un-natural in its system. In my case the un-natural substance was Humulin 70/30, and the body doesn't care the least, even if it's been processed using “rDNA” technology! Its job is to fight any intruder in its system. The alarm bells first appeared in the form of a mild headache, and when pain killers proved worthless I could do nothing but wait, till the throbbing headache died down automatically about 3 days later. Those restless days and nights would be etched forever in memory.  If the human body is a miracle, a supernatural, at times inexplicable phenomenon, then its an understated fact. Try churning up any adjectives in the English language that are synonymous to the ones I have described, and they would probably still fail to sum up how the human body really is! When I run out of real good adjectives I usually tend to bring “God” into the picture. The human body is “God”! How's that? Nope, I don't think that's a satisfying explanation, so I won't play with this anymore.  Within 4 days, my body seemed to have realized that Eli Lilly's Humulin 70/30 didn't mean any harm at all, and the best (if not the safest) bet for all the countless cells, molecules and organs was to accept and welcome this frequent visitor. Does it get more amusing?  Along with frequent bouts of high sugars (theoretically not exactly “hyper”), I had a couple of scary moments when I went low on my sugar levels. The first few experiences of hypoglycemia (low blood sugars) are terrible, but I consider them as experiences worth learning from, if you have to be prepared to face tougher situations and complications involving diabetes. Twice, it was real hypoglycemia, whereas on one occasion it was about my “mind games”, a false alarm, but creepy anyways.  Once, I woke up at 2:30 am in the middle of the night, with a cold sweat all over my body and feeling shaky, dizzy and weak, with a slight piloerection (erection of the hair), and in a confused state of mind. All classic symptoms of hypoglycemia. The symptoms do not look serious at first glance, but a prolonged condition (for say 30-45 minutes) can prove utterly dangerous. It was a real wake up call so to speak. However, within minutes, I grabbed some sugar and glucose biscuits, and was back to normal. Hypoglycemia is alright if you are able to react quickly and help yourself or if you have somebody around who knows how to treat it. The second hypo occurred during the daytime, 2 to 3 hours after I took my morning breakfast and although even with similar symptoms it appeared less dangerous, my sugar level read a meagre 56. I cannot recall why it occurred after eating my morning meal, but I assume it to be one of those weird things associated with diabetes that are impossible to explain scientifically or even practically. Hypoglycemia cannot get more treacherous if you have an atrociously low sugar but still hardly “feel” hypoglycemic. It's like being in a state of “hypo” without actually feeling it, and then by the time you feel it, you might not have any time to react, because of damage to the brain and the nerves. The brain ceases to function like normal. The speed with which this occurs is quite unbelieveable, and I say this from experience. Theoretically, a sugar level below 40 can be fatal, depending on how strong the individual is, although I have read about people bouncing back alive and well from levels as low as 20. Sounds almost unreal more than scary, but is true alright. People with diabetes for many years can develop something called as “Hypoglycemia Unawareness”, and its the worse thing to happen. A person loses consciousness without even knowing that his/her blood sugars are dropping. Perhaps the only way to treat this is by quickly delivering a “Glucagon” shot on time. Glucagon injection instantly raises sugar levels if the person is unable to swallow food.  During the case of the false alarm, which was more of a “psychological hypo”, I again woke up sometime in the night with a cold sweat. I checked my sugar instantly, and although I do not have it on record, it was well withing normal. Hypoglycemia was freaking me out and it was almost playing on my mind all the time, like a nightmare, robbing me of a good night's sleep. I felt jittery for no genuine reasons. It was a paranoia of some kind.    The Tax on Simple Pleasures    Diabetes put enormous pressure on me in the last 15 days I spent in India. I tried to hide it, but it became more or less apparent. I spent countless sessions with family members, discussing every issue related to the disease, read diabetes books, and tried to keep myself upbreast of diabetes news and information. I was hoping to give myself a break from sitting in front of a computer during these 3 weeks, but I wasn't to be spared. The Internet, obviously, happened to have a wealth of information on diabetes, and I began digging deep. I indugled in numerous chat sessions with my good friend Shaun, himself a Type-I diabetic here in Colorado, in order to get a feel of life as a diabetic in the United States, and without his help and tremendous support, things wouldn't have worked out so smoothly here for me. I spent most of the evenings with friends, and although I had quite a few “reunions” with old pals, I hated myself for not being as cheerful as I would have liked to be with them. I hated when people came to visit me, instead of me visiting them. My mind wandered towards the prospect of facing tougher hurdles as a student and a diabetic, all by myself, at Colorado State. Nightmares continued. Following a strict diet plan was adding fuel to fire. I would have loved to help myself with home-made delicacies and sweets and paying a visit to all the popular food joints in Pune, but I managed some leeway very rarely. The ups and downs in sugar levels didn't help, and that forced me to cut down on a lot of food.  Instead of the vacation serving as a well-deserved break from the gruelling semesters at CSU, I spent most of my time thinking about what the next semester would have in store for me. I was swamped with information on diabetes, but wasn't exactly high on confidence when I tried to apply it to my own benefit.    On the Road Ahead...    Believe me, hypoglycemia is horrifying, and learning insulin time activity profiles to utmost perfection is perhaps the first and the most vital step to avoid one. It took me months to figure out how my body adjusted to the type of insulin I was on, and also to unravel the somewhat mysterious pattern of how and when daily acitivites and meals affected my blood sugar levels. Understanding your diabetes on your own and taking actions accordingly is a painstaking and extremely frustrating process but its one of the things that I have probably done better than anything else at any point in my life. I had no idea that living in the United States as a diabetic would be an enitrely different ballgame when compared to how I tried to tackle it in India for the few days I spent there on vacation. The difference lies culturally, technologically, financially, apart from the obvious huge gap in the general lifestyle and eating habits. Arguably the biggest factor is the difference in diabetes care and treatment in both countries, especially for IDDM patients. After 3.5 weeks of perhaps not-the-best-of vacations in Pune, India, I was all set to be my own doctor in Fort Collins, Colorado.   Sure, more “Testing” times lay ahead for me!    >>  urlLink [Chapter 3 - The Sweet Legacy]
