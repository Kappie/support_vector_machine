Tomorrow will be the first day of trial examination and I am totally not ready yet... Not even a subject... Not even half a subject... Maybe because I cannot concentrate lately... I wonder what will my result be...Will it stay the same ? Or become worse ? Perhaps become better ? I don`t know... I am so confused now... Maybe because what happened last night... Last night , I sms her again... I asked her if I can walk her out of the school today... And then she replied "Thx for offering but I get used to walk alone ler..." Maybe she is trying to tell me something in that message... Maybe she wants to tell me something , but she afraid that it will hurt my feelings... Well...who knows ? All I can do now is guessing... Or maybe I`m just thinking too much ? Some of my friends suggested me to give up , some suggested to give her time... Time uh ? How long would it be ? If she needs time , she should have tell me... Maybe she does not need any... All I can do now is wait if time is the factor... I`m just too confuse now... Time will tell...
