(wonder did they bewitch the buzzers??) ..anyway.... they are pretty cool and well prepare.. they really deservo to win for all the reasons in the world. For one thing..they actually studied for sometime while we were laying flat on our bed watching some kinda stupid show.          Anyway... i seriously enjoy the whole trip there (except for the quiz it self... cuz we lost!!! ) .. we ended up second place... we would have been likely to be champion if we were in other zons.. their score seems to be pretty weak... and we would definetly score way higher if the st joseph`s boys hands were not that fast..sigh.. well..but on the other hand.. i was thankful to be in this zone for i meet the nicest person you can find on earth... it`s the st joseph boys.. Marcus Lee and Samuel Tsan.. you guys are cool (and of course smart too) .. hahaha... i`ll really look forward to another pool game..hahahaha         So what do i think about this whole national science quiz thing. Well.. from the very starting.. it`s seems to be a dream to get to this far.. oh come on man.. one stupid school from kajang which nobody on earth have ever heard on it get to the first round of national lvl.. We are the best in Selangor.. I`m seriously proud of that.. i owe all my thanks to my teammates.. Aqtar and Saha.. without them.. i`m in nowhere. So my finals standing of the end of our journey? believe it or not.. we enjoyed the damm thing. (even though we lost) ..hahaha
