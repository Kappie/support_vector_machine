I am gunna go go-karting for a few hours tmo, that'll be fun. but back to the subject. We took our somewhat short walk and came back to her house where we hung out. That was ok. It made me think about stopping smoking. Fuck that. Either stress or smoke will kill me. I was whisked off by my mom to the mall to look for clothes for my senior pix. I got some stuff on sale and some silvertab jeans. I went to hot topic alone b/c my mom is scared of that place. It costs too much money to look goth. $22 for a t-shirt that said SQUEE! and some of the all too famous artist's art. Fuck that. I like the way the sutff looks, but i dont love it. not 5 hours of my time for a t-shirt. nope. They are as bad as A, I sed it. Moving along, I went home and was taken to the highland police station for my teen court date. The guy there was stupid and rude. He didn't know anything about the court at all. Dumbass. I come home and i find out my sis ter has discovered some of my old game boy games. including the legendary. Pokemon. This was the yellow version. I popped it in my retro SP and I have been wasting my time since.  o dear, o dear, what to do, what to do  hmmmmm  www.jibjab.com they have fun stuff, rich sent me the link to their newest jab at both bush and kerry, it is funny, go see it.  www.atomfilms.com they are an indie film site featuring jib jab stuff, it is where i learned of jibjab from, go see them, too, anywho. good night
