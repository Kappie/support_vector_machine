Will be moving in to bird rescue center's studio apartment as care taker of grounds in six months to year. Rent Free.  4. Reading lots of Gary Snyder's poetry. growing beard again, becoming a mountain. Showering in the rain, wiping my ass behind a tree with a bear.  5. Winter at the rescue center kicks ass. no freaking baby birds.   current mood: caffinated current music: mogwai - may nothing but happiness come through your door
