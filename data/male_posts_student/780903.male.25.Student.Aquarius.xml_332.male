It totally eliminates all motivation to actually do it. Everything should be mandatory and graded if it's worth assigning... or so I say now.  Maybe a song will help me get motivated.  A song about procrastination.  From the musical "Annie."  Enjoy.  "Tomorrow"  The work'll get done  Tomorrow Bet your bottom dollar  That tomorrow I'll do work   Too busy until Tomorrow  Checking e-mail, watching TV reruns 'Til I sleep   When I'm stuck with a task That's dull And dreary,  I just load solitaire  And sit And play.  The work'll get done Tomorrow  Let the clock keep ticking  'Til tomorrow  Not today   Tomorrow! Tomorrow! I'll do it tomorrow!  You're always a day a way!  ...and if one song isn't enough...  "Maybe"  Maybe in an hour Or maybe in a day Something will click in my brain cells Telling me I shouldn't play Maybe when my list Of things to do grows long I'll start accomplishing something Rather than writing this song  Betcha I'll pass I'm sure I will It'll get done At some point, but still Doing it's not Really that bad Why can't I start  Then I'd be glad   So maybe now it's time, Instead of when I wake  I'll get it all done today, me Maybe.   Betcha I won't Won't even try Telling myself I know it's a lie Maybe it's hard And I should start  Maybe I should But I'm just not that smart   So maybe now this song Will get me going strong  Maybe I'll start it today, me Maybe... not.
