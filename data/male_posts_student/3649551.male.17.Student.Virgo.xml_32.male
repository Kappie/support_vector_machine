Pure genius, no? I can see somebody sitting around thinking about how it might be kind of funny to do something like that. But to actually spend the time to do it? What kind of maniac spends time making a cartoon like that, and then pays money for the domain? The truly funny thing to me is this: that's all there is to the site. What you see is what you get, aside from some links to the creator's real website. I haven't checked it out yet ... maybe I should give it a shot. Anyway, I just thought that was amusing and exquisitely random. Credit goes out to Michael the Crazy Asian for discovering it.
