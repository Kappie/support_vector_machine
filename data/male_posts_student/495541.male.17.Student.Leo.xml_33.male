I didn't want to post a link to it because I believe they change the links after a while on them.  The article is about Prince Philip making a joke.  His joke was this:  "Do you know they have eating dogs for the anorexic now?"  Here's the full article.   LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Philip has put his foot in it again -- with a joke about dogs and anorexics.   Queen Elizabeth's blunt-talking husband is renowned for gaffes that have caused blushes around the world from China to Australia.   And he hit the headlines again on Friday for all the wrong reasons after accompanying the monarch on a round Britain tour to celebrate 50 years on the throne.   Speaking to the blind Susan Edwards, wheelchair bound and accompanied by her guide dog, he remarked: "Do you know they have eating dogs for the anorexic now?"   Asked for her reaction after their brief encounter outside Exeter Cathedral in western England on Thursday, Edwards said: "It sounds like he was saying something terrible -- but he was just making a joke."   But Doreen Williams of the Anorexia and Bulimia Care organization was not amused. She called his comments "hurtful and unhelpful. I was quite stunned when I heard."   Reporters covering Prince Philip on royal tours keep their ears pricked for blunt off-the-cuff quips that often turn into diplomatic incidents.   Earlier this year on a trip to Australia, the prince asked Aborigines if they still threw spears at each other.   On another trip to Australia in 1998, he asked a student who had just returned from a walking tour in Papua New Guinea: "You managed not to get eaten then?"   But perhaps his most famous foreign faux pas came in China in 1986. He told British students: "If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed."   I want to now talk a little about this.  It seems the guy likes to make jokes at times.  The only problem with the equation is that anything he does inappropriate is plastered in the newspaper.  To be honest, this just shows the guy is human.  Keep in mind though that I'm saying this knowing almost nothing about the guy, so I'm probably off.  He could be a complete jerk.  But anyways, I just had to say that I feel bad that the guy can't make a joke.  We all say things inappropriate.  To think that he wouldn't is ignorant.  The only thing is that people in his position would most likely refrain from joking because they think more about getting a negative reputation.  They don't want people to think bad about them.  I just want to say that I admire the fact that he's being himself, good or bad.  At least he's not hiding anything.  Good night.
