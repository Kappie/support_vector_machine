Then me and the guys played Texas Holdem.. a modified version of poker.. we were practicing for a tournament that was being held up in the penthouse.. when it was about time for the tournament we went up and there was chips, soda, and free pizza!  We all had the munchies so we ate all the food.  Then it was our turn to play at the table.. after 16 hands.. i come out with the most $$ in chips.. therefore i win the tournament. The RA's prize was a t shirt and $15 in podium.. not bad..  Went back down to 21 and madd ppl came in to play power hour. i didn't want to drink bc i had class the next morning.. but eric couldn't finish his beer so i drunk 3 beers in one hour... decent buzz.. at around 1 am Angelo comes back from a weed run..  smoked 2 bowls and beautiful dutch rolled by eric .. the guys and girls zone out to winamp5 visualizations in james' room.. i leave at 230am.. went back to the room and ate food while watching True Lies.. awesome movie.  Today.. woke up at 1130 am.. went to MyUAlbany to get my class schedule.. and the server is down... i'm supposed to be in class right now.. but i don't know what room.. i don't know if i should blame myself for not printing out my schedule.. or blame UAlbany's shitty web based system. i didn't get enough sleep last night.. i'm frustrated..  i hate missing class.. especially the FIRST day ..  Have a SMUTTY day..  - R w L super SMUT
