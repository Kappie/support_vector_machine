The M6 toll road is amazing and really empty! We finally arrived at Dover and boarded the ferry. Ryan has never been on one so he was a bit scared at first. Last night he said to Dan, "I'm sitting by the window!" The ferry set off and I started clicking my camera rapidly taking pictures of anything and everything. I got some really good pictures of seagulls which had decided to race the ferry lol. We arrived in Calais and swiftly parked at the nearest roadside parking area. Grandma went the loo in the Holiday Inn across the road and then we set off through the busy streets of Calais, and god were they busy. There were so many cyclists going up and down the road, an obvious difference from any UK city. Grandma bravely got a phone card from "La Tabac" or something, by saying "Par Lay Voo Arnglays" (spelt phonetically), and we managed to buy a phone card which we could ring England cheaply with. After walking back through the busy streets we made our way to our nice hotel. The entrance lobby is really cool looking and most of the staff speak "un peu" English, which is enough to get us by, plus I know quite a bit of French so we're okay. The view from our room is amazing. Near to the hotel is the Cit√© Europe shopping mega mall with tons of shops and low (hopefully) prices.  Later on in the day we decided to go swimming in the cool hotel pool. We got there and all hopes of a nice swim fizzled out when we found out that it is 'French law' that you're not allowed to wear swimming shorts for swimming! Instead you had to swear these skimpy swimming garments which resembled underwear. I really hated them so I didn't bother going swimming. I dunno, the French and their 'Tight' laws ;) Ryan, and Daniel (eventually) went in with Grandad but I just sat aside and watched with Grandma. Afterwards we were all hungry and decided to look for something to eat. By the time we had got round to it the restraunt had stopped serving and the only option left was room service, bar pizzas which were unavailable. I had this chicken curry and noodle type dish which was really tasty and not really spicy at all. Went to bed around midnight and I went hyper because it was night time and I had had way too much Fanta!
