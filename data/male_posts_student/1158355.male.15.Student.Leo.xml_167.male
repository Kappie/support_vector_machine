Ok, that was boring. The AP Euro test was a fucking killer, it was too long and too hard. I definetly failed it, but who gives a shit. Today, what's going on today? I don't know, I'm just lumpin around my house, playing games, eating foods, and doing the usual slimety shlam dance. Tomorrow and the next day are days of lazyness and fun. Being by myself, living off the fat of the land. Peace and quiet. That's how I like it, with an occasional human here and there. That is all.
