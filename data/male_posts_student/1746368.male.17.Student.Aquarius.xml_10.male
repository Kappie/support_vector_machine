Today is the last day of summer vacation. *Sigh*. I'm actually not that bugged as usual.  My friend just got a new computer game called  urlLink Tron 2.0 . If any of you have seen the movie "Tron" it's based off of that. A bit into the game you get to race on the light cycles. It's a first person shooter that I highly recommend. My friend gave me the demo. I'm going to play it after this post.  Also, today I finally mastered a really good trick on the trampoline. My neighbor (Chris) and I usually bounce on it in the hopes that we get better and better. Today I was standing on the bar, and I decided "Why not". So I faced away from the inside of the trampoline and did a backflip onto the canvas of the trampoline. It's pretty cool if it is executed properly. I also have managed to do backflips without jumping to start it off. Chris and I always try to make up new tricks. We are never satisfied with the tricks we already know.  What else did I do today? Oh, I watched "The One". I've been wanting to see it ever since it came out in theatres. Never got the chance until now. The Jennings recorded it, so I was able to watch the whole thing. I thought the ending was terrible. It didn't really make sense.  The "Colin has laughed" award goes to the same person as yesterday. Take a look at the third post in the entry three down. It's laughable. Because of this person I have also invented the "Contradictory" award. It goes to the same person.  Well, I've got a demo to play. It only has light cycle races, but those are good enough, for now. Have a great day everyone. Don't forget, "Artifical intelligence never beats natural stupidity!" (and I would know).
