The only saving cartoon worth watching is XiaoLin Dragons on Kids Central, but that's ending in two weeks' time too. Sigh!!   Oh well. We went out to buy my brother's TYS. Even the TYS were so mooing. Yes. Anyway, I brought 2 books. Luck Be a Lady (Charmed book) and The Time Traveler's Wife, one which I have been wanting for ages! I am currently in the midst of Luck Be A Lady. How  charm ing!  Anyhoo, we went to Admiralty Place to eat lunch. Ergh. Lunch was sucky, the place was stuffy. Forget it. I came home, read my books, then went online.  Yeah. I did my PW work, typing the minutes and updating all our info. Yep.  sent all relevant documents to Gek. Yep. After that, I surfed the Net.   After all that surfing on the surfboard (IE), riding the waves and waves of information and binary codes, I disconnected me computer and went to play the PS2. PoA game la, what else? Heh. I played for a long time..till6. Then I went out and buy dinner (chicken chop rice).   Yeah. After dinner, I went to bath and here I am, online. YAY! Another chapter up for Something More! HaHa! Right. I am becoming more dramatic today! I wonder why! Drama king! (I can't bear to bestow the title of "Drama Queen" on myself! I just can't! I am not dramatic enough! Drama King is, of course, at a lower level than Drama Queen!)  Right. Overdramatic. Right. I gotta get going, read my Charmed book. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
