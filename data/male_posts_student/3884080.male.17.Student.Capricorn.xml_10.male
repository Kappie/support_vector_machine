I called her while i was at work, i know thats not how you should tell someone the relationship is over but i couldnt wait, i had to tell her, i didnt want her to wait longer thinking that we would get back together when in my mind i knew it wasnt supposed to be that way. I know a beak up is never a good thing but i feel that we needed it, i needed it anyway, she told me she didnt want it but in the end i know she will realize it was for the best reasons. I told her on the phone though that we are not going to stop hanging out, i told her i want her to be my best friend i never want to lose the closeness we have. Yeah it will be awkward for a few days, but as time rolls on i know it will all be like it should be. I know she doesnt like the decision i made but i know she respects it. Im still going to be here for her whenever she needs anything at all. I am never going to stop talking to her. Just because our "dating relationship" is over doesnt mean our "best friends relationship" has to end to. thats about all i have to say.  Its 3:20 in the morning. Im going to bed
