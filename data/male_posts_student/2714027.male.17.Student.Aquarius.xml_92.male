I thought it was going to be like  Bowling For Columbine , but it wasn't as clean cut or colourful, but more serious and thought provoking. There were so many little facts and items that I'd never even heard about and that shocked me, so who knows what the response is going to be like in the States. In some ways, the film made me glad that I live somewhere that has organisations like the BBC who report things properly (even though our newspapers are utter crap) and a goverment who aren't quite as bad as many make out.  In other, more trivial news, my camera isn't here yet (boo!), but the party on Saturday nears (yeah!), meaning that I have to get my head round what I want to say and do regarding the girl from May (hmm...).
