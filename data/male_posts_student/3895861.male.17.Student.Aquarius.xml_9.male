WARNING: THIS COULD MAKE YOU RATHER SICK, SKIP TO THE LINE OF ASTERISKS IF U ARE A PUSSY! ****************************************************************** Why the fuck do I have to be so damn curious? huh?  http://www.ag0ny.com/images/2004/05/13/hamster-porn/hamster-porn-P1010027.jpg  go ahead! copy and paste! Good god. After I saw the site on dolphin sex, I think to myself "I wonder if there are other sites liek that." Then comes the Google box on my Opera browser (Screw IE!). I look up stuff. I will say it again, ppl are fucked up!  http://www.algonet.se/~giljotin/explan.html  He's married to the Berlin Wall. Yah, married. to the berlin wall. They were married in 1979. I wonder if he is pissed off at Reagan. nvmnvmnvm, don't ask what that means. Did he just say one day "I love the Berlin wall!". Then his little sister says "Well if you love it so much, why don't marry it?". Then he says "Yes!, I think I will!". WTF? Now I think to myself "are there other ppl liek this?". i don't just mean married to the berlin wall, or places in general. I mean, do ppl love things? I mean, do ppl love things sexually? Well, yah they do.  http://www.geocities.com/gnxlover/  Go there. He likes to have sex with cars. I do not mena that he likes to have sex in cars or on cars, an activity I enjoy myself. I mean that he likes to have sex WITH cars. 1980's cars. The sick bastard.  http://blackroses.textfiles.com/sex/sex-cars.faq  That is a guide as to how one would have sex with a car. Go ahead. It tells you how to make an SIU. What is an SIU? It is a sexual interface unit. It is what you use to have sex with a car. It also equates the tailpipe of a car to the anus of a person. Dear lord I hope no one is sitll reading this.   http://www.onzin.nl/fufme/index.shtml.htm  That is how you have sex with another person through the computer. That's right kids, you can have sex over the internet using your computer. Also, it's $500 for one. ************************************************************************  OK. that is over. Just one more thing of note, really I put it here for the ppl who didn' read the other part. A year or two ago, RED MEAT became my favorite comic, replacing Speed Bump, and a bit earlier, Dilbert.  www.redmeat.com  It is hilarious and dark. i saw it in the onion first.  www.theonion.com  It is a parody of the news. It is liek the daily show in print. It is schweet.  This is my second-favorite comic. It is called toothpaste for dinner. It is cool. There is horrible art and bad handwriting. But it's content is awesome. It is kinda liek NES. They dint have any processor to work with, so all the games looked crappy. If they wanted to sell any games at all, they had to have a damn good idea. This leads me to all that is evil in hollywood today. You might have heard of a movie about the the world getting royally fucked up by climate change. It sucked. It's name shall not grace a blog of mine. Millions were spent on the special effects to make it look liek NYC had been taken over by the ocean and then frozen. There were also CG wolves that attacked the main character. It was horrible. I sat through the whole thing thinking "at some point this movie will get better and it will be worth it". It dint get better. It sucked liek a Thai hooker. lol, i capitalized "Thai".
