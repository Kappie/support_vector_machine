(images available  urlLink here  and  urlLink here )  Recent visitors say that they are impressed by the immensity of the memorial, which I am happy to hear. The memorial should instill some sense of the grandeur of the sacrifice given by so many Americans as well as WWII's impact on the development of our national identity.  If you know a WWII veteran, ask them about their service and sacrifice, and tell them Thank You!
