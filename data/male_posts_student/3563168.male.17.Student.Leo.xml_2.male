I'm gonna make love to the person that comes up with a cure for the common cold (considering it's a woman (considering she's hot)).  Does anyone know how I got sick during the summer anyway? That's never happend to me before, I dunno why.  Due to the fact that I stay up so late, I've started watching "Hawaii 5-0". It's pretty badass, almost as badass as "Matlock".  I figure if I get a vacuum and put it in my nostrils, they will finally clear up. That would be badass.
