The homie Geoff had been playing Grand Theft Auto 3 the day before and he was working on his sniping technique....well he put it to good use last night....he finished in 2nd place (out of 32) all from sniping people in one spot....I finished in 4th place for the second time in a row.....we also had nine other classmates (all female) show up as victims in our massacre....  Then we headed to a kegger thrown by our classmate Sean....cool guy that Sean!  I found the criterion collection of Do The Right Thing at Suncoast yesterday!.....and Hollywood Shuffle.....and I also came up on some sweet LaCoste shirts for $15 each....  My sisters are coming up tonight!....I can't wait it's gonna be a great week!!!!
