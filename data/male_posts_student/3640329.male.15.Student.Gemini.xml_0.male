The first visit was to the  urlLink Cat Museum  which is located on top of a Siol hill.Not only does it exhibits cats from all over the world but also the history of Kuching,the capital of Sarawak,and Santubong.Next we had our lunch at the Beach Seafood Restaurant.The restaurant is located along the beach but there were no massive waves on the sea since its not the monsoon season.It is very hot during that time and it is advisable to drink a lot of water.After lunch,we checked in at   urlLink Santubong Kuching Resort  where you can have a great view of  urlLink Gunung Santubong .Dinner time we had barbeque at the Talang Restaurant. Checked out from the resort the next day and have our breakfast before going to the Sarawak Cultural Village.The Sarawak Cultural Village is located on the foot of Gunung Santubong and the local 'dayaks' will display their daily traditional activities and their longhouses.At noon,there is a cultural show at the SCV theatre where they will perform their traditional dances.Before lunch,we went to Kampung Santubong and entered one of villagers kampung to get a taste of their delicious 'kuehs'.We then had lunch at Satok before going to Pasar Satok.After shopping at Satok,we checked in at Harbour View hotel where we will be staying for 2 nights.We had our dinner at Top Spot seafood foodcourt.We were entertained with karakokes and music while we had our dinner.
