I think the government would have a lot of problems trying to make abortion illegal again. I believe many would see it as an erosion of women's rights. Just this Sunday a huge rally was held in Washington with over 800,000 people marching for pro choice. Like Sarah said, I also think that religion should not have a place in this issue. This issue is an all American issue. An individual's moral beliefs whether it is based on religion, family, etc, is not significant to everyone. Then you can get into ethnics and if the fetus is an actual baby and things just get confusing. How I see it, the law is already standing, and making abortion illegal is an infringment on women's rights to choose. Is abortion wrong...well I think it is. But what about freedom... the foundation of American identity.   I'd like to be honest and say that I am worried if 2nd period debates about gay marriages. This issue is extremely personal and emotional for me.
