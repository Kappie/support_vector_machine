So Jim must go for a few days without an auto.  Sucks to be him.  Sucks more that we gave him our car to use for the time being.  Crapola!  Cant wait for Sunday as John wants a 2 hour yoga/meditation/breathing session.  Should be sweet.  Ring in the new year with yoga... Should be cool.  Must make squid for dinner tonight.  Man, I love Calamari.  Good shit.  Really.  Dont know what you're missing unless you try some of the stuff I make.  Simple.  Just put the squid in a bit of seasoned flour and chuck it in some olive oil.  Sure beats most of the stuff you find in a restaurant.  Well, now off to clean and then relax before the Christmas Madness.  Been listening nonstop to Breaking Benjamin as well.  Not quite Christmas music, but fits the season in my mind.  Besides, he would have agreed with me...
