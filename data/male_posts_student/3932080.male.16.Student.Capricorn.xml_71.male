Called  Gana la Verde  ( Win the Green ), the Spanish television program awards its winner with a team of lawyers who may help the contestant speed up the process of immigration into the United States. Initially referred to as a more rewarding  Fear Factor , the show breeds the want for citizenship with bogus physical feats;  Yahoo!  reports that "gulping down live tequila worms, trapping a butter-drenched pig and jumping between two speeding 18-wheelers" are just a few examples of such stunts.  So let's get this straight:  Gana La Verde  will put anxious Hispanics and Mexicans to the test so that they can gain rights into a country that will treat them poorly? Ultimately, the winner of this show will end up eating trash (live tequila worms), working a low-end farm job that no one wants (trapping a slippery pig), and running from the cops (jumping between two trucks). It sounds like this so-called reality show is more like American training.
