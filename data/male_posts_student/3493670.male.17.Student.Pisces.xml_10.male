Contrary to popular belief, I don't write in my blog to update people about the things going on in my life. I write for myself and I find blogging cathartic. Its like my release. When walls are not available to punch, there comes the blog. ^_^   As I tried to sleep last night, I got to thinking about myself. Why did I let this happen? Why the fuck must it go this far to realize our priorities? Why do we keep procrastinating? What the fuck is wrong with you Matt?!?! Dammit! This is your fault. You know it.Why do problems arise one after the other? Sometimes, the other problem hasn't been solved, then comes another one. Give us a break please!   Allow me to explain further.   I had a so-so day as usual. Promised myself to do my assignments but my laziness got the better of me and Iwatched Frida for the nth time. I had to go to Greenbelt 3 to meet Athan and his friend cuz I promised to lend himTheOne's qaf CDs. I went to surplus shop to buy A tan suede zip up jacket but ended up having it reserved so I can have more choices. I made friends with the surplus shop manager, Chona. As I went down to the grocery store to stock up my ref again. I decided to go home. I played with BB and waited forTheOne to call.   As I txtedTheOne to sayhi, my phone rang. It was him. We were talking about each other's day and everything was going great. Then out of nowhere, he told me that hismom asked if I am his boyfriend. I froze. I panicked and suddenly, I felt derailed. Derailed from the tracks of a happyweek.But I managed to ask him about his response, He said he simply smiled and left. We also talked aboutour paperwork. We haven't done that much.Andit is my fault forstaying on the phone for long. He confessed thathe'd rather make me go to UP instead of talking at nightcuz nighttime is the time that he studies andnighttime is also that time that I study. And talking on the phone occupies the hours that should be spent studying. I should've known better. I must admit he is right. And what we talked abouttriggered my resolve to exercise further self control.   I love you TheOne. We can do this.We'll support each other and hold each other's hand through all this. Let's just learn from what's happening. And I am sorry thatit had to go this far for me to realize it.   I love you and I always will.
