Man, that Billy Conolly.  First up was Russian Tsarcasm, who, with a partial drumkit and a single guitar, manage to destroy the notion that it's impossible to recognize "good" avant-garde noise rock.  Because you can tell this isn't.  Fifteen minutes of steady pounding by an individual who was previously only known to me as a really good shoplifter, followed by one minute of guitar scree by a guy wearing acoustic dampening foam like a cape.  How this received more than polite applause is beyond me, truly.  They were followed by Ghost to Falco, from Portland, OR.  This is certainly a daring choice for a band name, because even with their 7" sitting in front of me I have to keep referring back to it to get it right.  Since shortly before the show started at 8 pm I have referred to them as "Ghost vs Pilot", "Pilot to Bombardier", and other assorted permutations thereof.  There is probably a reason for this.  A one-piece, Ghost to Falco bear a strong sonic resemblance to various 555 Recordings groups like Hood and Halkyn;  the principal difference being that Ghost to Falco are far less wilfully messy than Hood, and less folkish than Halkyn.  The crowd sucked, as always.
