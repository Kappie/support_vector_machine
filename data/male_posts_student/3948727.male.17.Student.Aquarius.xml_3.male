Being a DIE-HARD Laker fan I wanna believe that we can survive without the big-man.I mean Kobe Bryant is argueble the best player in the NBA, but he's still not Micheal Jordan. MJ won championships without a center in the middle but I have a bad feeling that Kobe can't pull that feat off. So the question is who got the better end of the deal? The Miami Heat or the L.A. Lakers? Looking at the rosters Miami only really have three good players, Dwayne Wade, Eddie Jones, and now Shaq. And really Eddie Jones isn't a star player, but he's still decent enough to get the job done. Also pressuming that Pat Riley gets more support around Shaq I can see the Heat prolly making the Eastern Conf. Finals. But then you have to consider that Shaq has to be in shape and healthy the WHOLE season, not just part of it like he was with L.A. Now let's look at L.A.'s side. Kobe Bryant at shooting, Payton at point, Odom at power, Butler at small, and BRIAN GRANT at center. Maybe it's just me but having Brian Grant in the center does NOT make you a powerhouse. Even if they go out and get Vlade, he's still not the center that he used to be, and he definitly doesn't compare to a Shaquille O' Neal. Now the conference difference. Shaq has been moved to the Eastern conference, thats bad news for the rest of the east. You can quote me on this, "Shaq will start as center in the All-Star game this year." It's just about a guarentee. Look for his numbers to go up TREMENDOUSLY from last year. Not only does he have to worry bout sharing the spotlight with Kobe, but also the points. I see Shaq averaging AT LEAST 28 points per game. Consisdering that then I would predict the Heat to be one of the top three teams in the East. Now taking a look at the Lakers in the Western Conf. and all I can think of is who's gonna be the top draft choices for the lottery, because it doesn't look good at all. With everybody in the west upgrading with more firepower, and some teams stayin the same(Spurs, TImberwolves) Chances of them makin playoffs are slim to none. Unless Kobe can prove all the critics wrong and play like his idol, MJ. But again it's a fat chance of seeing that happen. So when it all boils down to it I guess you could say that the better end of the deal went to the Heat, that is until Shaq gets old enough towhere he he's not a dominant force. And believe me that time is coming soon. Well thats the sportsnews for today, be back when I find more intersting sports news.
