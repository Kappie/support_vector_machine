However, she is now living with 4 kids and you know, kids are always kids and we are afraid that Brownie might find it too stress to handle them. Don't say Brownie, I can't even tolerate 4 kids at one time. You know how noisy they can be at times..Anyway, this would be a short blog; I have to rush for my HYP...
