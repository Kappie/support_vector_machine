English I just simply wrote out of point, can be corrected, if only they gave the right questions lol. Geog just have to memorize the mainpoints and I hopefully can be sitting on an A1. Chem is like......hmmm, failing is expected. I don't find chemistry difficult, I am just not bothered to study. My motto in studying is this, nothing is too difficult for my brain to absorb. And I believe everyone should have that mottoo, nothing is too difficult.  I'm not really interested in chem, because I do not see how chem will have any impact in my life, I don't see chem making a diff. in my life. Cos' after secondary school, chem is over for me. But as for physics, I WANT to study, because yea, I like physics, and maths, I'm being dragged down, because physics I need to be good in maths, especially for quantum mechanics. So, yea, I'm interested in maths because I see its relevance. English, well, sociology, philosophy and the like, i like discussing them, so english, yea relevant. Social studies, in line with political science, yea interested in that also, geog in line with sociology   I actually decided to give guitar lessons again, the first few q few months back was a flop, probably because I did not know much theory, and knew shit about scales, chords and the like. Now, yea, I've gotten back in business and my first student, technically not the first, but the first one to get taught by the new improved me. I actually hesitated about wanting to give lessons, because of O levels yada yada. But if its all those, "do it after the O levels" stuff, I wouldn't be interested in quantum physics, and in fact would not have done alot of things. Geog, in line with sociology, so I can say that fortunately stuff i do, I'm interested in them.  Don't talk to me about bio, or physical geog, or the earth sciences, those stuff are boring imo. Anyway, yah my tests marks besides those sucky ones are.  Emaths: 45/60 (75%) Amaths: 52/60 (85%) Physics: 39/45 (86%) Social Studies: 25/25 (100%)  So anyway, I taught guitar, and it was pretty good. I actually thought he wasn't that bright, but really, he's one of those guys, kinda like James Chadwick, quiet, and LOOKS unpromising, then kaboom, before you know it, he discovered the neutron. He is actually quite smart, and I taught him actually the basics, like notes and accidentals. Then we went on to powerchords then string bending, then Enter Sandman. He is pretty good at riffs though, but riffs aren't my forte, so i don't think I will have much to teach him about rhythym guitar.   I myself am no expert on rhythym either, I don't even know how to do syncopation and stuff, and all those rhythyms. more on lead and I intend to touch on that with him next week. A minor pentatonic, the root shape first and basic improvisation. He has good rhythymic sense, but I don't know about his melodic ear, so I'll see it next week. Anyway, great lesson though, and one more student is incoming, actually its good, because students I've been getting fits into my area which I'm better at which is lead guitar, and I've had a few breakthroughs in my theory knowledge so far, and I hope to cover the mixolydian, phrygian and locrian myself.  I've already learnt the 5 pentatonic shapes, can already play the A minor pentatonic all over the fretboard, and the G minor pentatonic as well. Whoo......things are indeed looking up........
