Books are piled against my bookcase which is crammed in all ways immaginable. I dream of a new room, redone with a massive bookcase covering one wall. It would hold all of my books and be the pride and beauty of the whole room. I could invite people into my room and say, "Oh, yes. And this is were I keep some of my books." Of course, for this dream to be realized, I would have to clean my room, an act akin to an archeological dig, remove some unneeded furniture, and move everything else. But maybe one day, this dream will come true.  National Honors Society has welcomed me with open arms. I'm in and the final induction will occur tomorrow. I can only dream of the mysterious cult practices of such a society. Will there be drinking of goats' blood? Perhaps nudist dancing 'round the old pentagram?  Heck, we may even upgrade to a hexagram. I plan to work for a offical position in NHS. Maybe treasurer or vice-prez. I don't want president, because that involved too much power and leadership for my tastes. That is the one "pillar" of NHS I truly lack: leadership. I tend to neither follow nor lead, but simply go as I please until I find a better tug. Example given: I sit alone in meetings. I feel I can be an embarrassment to my friends, especailly around their other friends, so I sit alone and in the peaceful knowledge that I harm no one. Unless someone calls me over. That's key. If I'm called, I am relieved of the duty of nonaction and free to act in the proper fashion.
