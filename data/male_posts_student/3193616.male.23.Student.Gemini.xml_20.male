Yamraj answered, 'Those are Lie Clocks. Everyone on Earth has a Lie Clock. Every time you lie, the hands on your clock will move.'  'Oh,' said Rabri,  'Who's clock is that?'  That's Gautam Buddha's. The hands have never moved  indicating that he never told a lie. 'And whose clock is that?' That's Abraham Lincoln's clock. The hands have only moved twice, telling us that Abraham only told 2 lies in his entirelife.'  Rabri asked, 'Where's my Laloo's clock?'  Laloo's clock is in my office', replied yamraj, 'I'm using it as ceiling fan' !!! Just a joke- laugh and forget. I am not personally agianst Laloo and his herd of cattle.
