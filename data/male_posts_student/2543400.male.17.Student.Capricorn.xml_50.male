What not! Got a bunch of pics, yay! And i guess that's pretty much it. But I had fun and got to miss school, a big plus!  Anyways, i'll post the pics as soon as i'm back in the country and have a decent net connection. i better be off now, as this net is getting slower by the second and people are wanting of a net connection. i'll writer asap. Ohh... I can writer without looking at the keyboard or the screen. :p This is fun! Anyayws better be off.
