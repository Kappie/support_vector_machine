I'll have to say i love you in a song, Jim Croce Two weeks without my lover. i'm floating in the boat alone. floating down a river called emotion Aqueous Transmission, Incubus"  So yeah that was about it...well i'm gonna miss my friends ,my blog but most of all emily. i truly believe that what we have can never be undone...just like a double knot in my shoes...ha ha ha emily will get it. (8) Goodbye fairwell...uhh dun dun dun dun crapiforgotthewoooooooooorrrdddssssA! Sam
