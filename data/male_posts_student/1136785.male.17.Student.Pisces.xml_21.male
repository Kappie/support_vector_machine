But for the truly important world, a relocation of the greatest magnitude has taken place! I am currently, and will be so for the next ten weeks, in New Haven Connecticut - Room J32B, Saybrook College, Yale University to precise. The actual action of getting to Yale was frantic, chaotic, tedioud, and boring all at once. All I will say is that somewhere along the way, I managed to pack 96 pounds of clothes into a massive red suitcase. I wasn't even aware I owned so many articles of clothing. I will admit, in my sleep deprived state on the morning of flight (five to six hours in advance) I did get into a fight with my luggage to prove I could so pack all of those clothes! Unfortunately I won, and will liklely have a hernia upon return to Kansas City.  I can't believe I even mentioned that, as classes just started today. Memorial Day - the sick bastards. I had to skip breakfast to head to a late registration for my single class, Elementary Modern Standard Arabic, and then immediately proceeded to class. Three hours where I was not so much taught the langauge as beaten with it by a large, very nice and intelligent, Sudanese Professor. Then followed purchasing of 165 dollards worth of text books. Then six hours of homeworks. Six wretched, working through dinner hours. But whatever, I knew this would be tough. At least there is pocky. I'll do more updates later. Much apologies to Emma, as her good news segment will be in and out depending on how much time I have. Same with the boring and important. Now I'm off!
