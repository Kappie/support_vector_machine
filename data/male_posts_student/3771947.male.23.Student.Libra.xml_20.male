I am not really looking forward to the trip because of all the things on my mind and the people at home who I have so little time left with. I am going with Andy and I'm sure he will cheer me up once we are on the road.  I put the house on the market and it sold in one day for full price to the fist person who saw it. Not bad. Settlement is August 31st. So much to do so little time.  My parents have been wonderful, so supportive of everything in my life. Everyone around me has added something. Its as if all the pieces of some great puzzle are coming together. I feel calm; at ease with my life, even though a move to a new city, two court cases, and rocky relationship are all before me. I feel I have made the right decisions and I will be happy with what the outcomes will be. Honestly, I have never before felt so at ease. Everything just feels right.
