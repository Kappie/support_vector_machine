In the West especially!  4 teams battling for the last 2 positions.  St. Louis could be out!  No Anaheim or Minnesota!  Add Nashville and Calgary.   THIS is March Madness!  PS.   There's a kid playing on a line in Toronto with Ron Francis.  Stajan is 20 years old, born in 1983.  Francis played in the NHL All-Star game in 1983, his 2nd year in the league.  ENJOY THE GAME!
