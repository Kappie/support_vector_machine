Really I'm trying to get a firm grasp on what it is I should believe about dating/courting. I know, I know, I may seem like I have all that stuff together. And I do kinda. See, it's like, for some crazy reason, various females consider(ed) me atractive. Maybe they were crazy. Either way. It's like.... I don't know what it's like. I don't even know what to say! I'm just coming here and dumping it all on everybody. But that's why I made this thing. So good times. Let's run down the list in my head.  1. I believe that God has called me away from having any serious relationship (more than friends) with a girl. I believe mainly because at this point in my life, I can't really trust my feelings. I mean, yeah. Again, I don't know what I mean.  2. I believe that Dating is "wrong". Do I though? I see my friends, who I consider to have a strong relationship with the almighty, and I see that they date. What does this mean? One of two things. Either its okay for them to date, or they're just not listening to God. I'm not saing at this point that it's one or the other. I don't really know what to think there.  3. Even if I were sure that it was okay for me to date, I still wouldn't because my parents do not think it is a wise choice. And seeing as how they are my parents, and I am under their authority, I must do as they say. And willingly, with a good heart.  Conclusion: Despite the fact that this matter confuses me, and I do to a certain point have the desire to date, I will not. Because I am under my parents authority, and I have been commanded by God not to enter into any serious boyfriend/girlfriend relationships. Even if my parents encouraged me to date, I couldn't. Because God has instructed me otherwise.   Sometimes, I wish for the days when girls had cooties, and all you did was throw mud at them. But then I think, "Man, think how much I'm growing here! I'm being taught to surrender my will, to that of God and my parents. I believe I'm growing spiritually. I'm maturing. I'm standing firm." That's the big one. Standing firm. The world says, "conform" I say, "I am who I am, and I will not change until God tells me to". Yes it's hard. Yes, it's not very fun. Yes I would like to ask a girl out, and have a good time. But guess what. It's not gonna happen. Maybe, sometime in the future, God will say, you know what Caleb? It's okay for you to date. You're mature, you're devoted to Me, you're responsible. I have no idea if that will happen, and I don't expect it to. And I'm fine with that. Satan really brings to mind all the things about dating that appeal to me. The sense of a partner. And other things. But in all of that, I remind myself that it's not God's plan for me. It all comes down to trust. If I can't give this part of my life to God, then I'm not giving my all. And I promised my all when I asked him to forgive my sins, come into my heart, and change me. I can give Him nothing less. And I don't want to give Him anything less. I want Him to hold my entire life in His hands. I want to follow Him no matter what the world says is cool, or right. Sure I'll stumble everynow and again. But I intend to get right back up, and follow my savior. I'm pretty sure He knows where He's going.
