I am coming to you in power and in might in these last days.  The smell of latter rain. The smell of the new anointing is almost here. Be prepared! I have formed you, I have fashioned YOU for this very hour, to take in and to give what you have received.   Do Not hold back! Do Not hold back!  Call out to me with a loud voice, with a great shout, Declare this day that, 'I am your God.'  God is calling us,  Come closer to me Come closer to me Do not hold back Do not hold back Come closer Listen for my voice, See what I am doing.  The shower of blessings are here... Look Listen Smell I am preparing to rain - reign on the earth once again. To reign with a new power. a new authority in you my people.  Come forth Taste and see that I AM GOOD. Take and give Take and give. Do not be afraid, for I have prepared a way where there seems to be no way.  ASK of me and I WILL show you great and mighty things which you knowest not! ( you don't even know ).  Everything is in place - come to me now with an attitude of expectancy."
