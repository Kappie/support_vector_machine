A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items infront of him.  When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golfballs.He then asked the students if the jar was full.They agreed that it was.               So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar.  He shook the jar lightly.  The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls.  He then asked the students again if the jar was full.  They agreed it was.    The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar.Of course, the sand filled up everything else.  He asked once more if the jar was full.  The students responded with a unanimous "Yes."    The professor then produced two cups of coffee from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand.  The students laughed.   "Now," said the professor, as the laughter subsided, "I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life.The golf ball are the   important things--your family, your children,your health, your friends, your favorite passions--things that ifeverything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full .    The pebbles are the other things that matter like   your job, your house,your car . The sand is everything else--the small stuff."   "If you put the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls.  The same goes for life.     If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will neverhave room for the things that are important to you .      Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.    Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your spouse out to dinner. Play another 18 holes.  There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal."Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter.   Set your priorities .  The rest is just sand."                  One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented.The professor smiled.  "I'm glad you asked.  It just goes to show you that   no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend."                       So...... , anybody ready to pay for my cup of coffee ;-).
