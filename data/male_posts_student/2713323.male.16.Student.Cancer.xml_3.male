No mood to study...I went to post something to a friend today....man the queue was horrendous! After which i went for lunch at this small malay bistro, the food was okay but the weather was fanastic! The breeze and everything was so wonderful...when i strolled home i was thinking to myself, "How wonderful life can be...". But it aint as wonderful this year...theres the Os, and yeah, im worrying my ass off. I enjoyed my walk today more then ever, felt it was much meaningful than any other stroll i've taken. I appreciated the solitude the most! O well, thats for today, ciao.
