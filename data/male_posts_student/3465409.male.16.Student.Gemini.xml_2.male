The four main parties running where Liberals, Conservative, NDP, and Bloc Quebecois. Now the Bloc Quebecois, the federal party based in Quebec, has no chance of winning but still runs (sort of like Ralph Nader). My sister was saying how she REALLY didn't want the Liberals to win, because of all the bad/not-so-good things she has heard about them. She is only 12. Of course the Liberals win, but not by a majority. Therefore Canada is now screwed, government wise, for the next two years until they have another election.       Now the US is also getting ready for a federal election. There are only four more months until November, which still is a long ways away. The campaign commercials are already very annoying. Now the sad thing about American elections is basically how they are done. It takes forever to do. Looking at the polls right now, the 2004 election looks like it will probably be another 2000 election. So it's a year of campaigning, a month to vote, and another half a year to decide who is president and in the end the Supreme Court might decide. That's the voting system of the most powerful country in the world. Wonderful.       Canada has a good way of doing elections. It's fast and well done. But then a party can win by a minority, therefore giving it basically no control. America has trouble doing elections. It takes way to long and can get really messed up. Why not try and combine the two ideas? Both countries need help with elections. As for America's 'confusing' ballots, why not make something easier. Like an ATM machine or something. Perhaps someday..........
