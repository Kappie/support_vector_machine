Its a song which the outside people cannot hear... as its self-composed... so nice! Almost become my favourite song immediately now.. So touching..   Wrote a long letter and send to Grace. Hope she would receive it. Dunno why, these few days, or rather since the starting of this semester, I haven't been able to concentrate during lectures. Think I have slacked a lot. Haha.. or is it because Grace is not around, then disrupt my daily life that I have grew accustomed to? haha.. stop blaming others.. Its plain simple... I am lazy..keke  Today is Valentines Day. Dunno how to celebrate.. Later in the afternoon maybe going out with Keith and Fabian and Serene..See how lor..  Ok la.. nothing much to write also.. Bye..
