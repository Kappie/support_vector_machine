Lol.  Me: Hey Dez Pez! Me:  HANSON? [her buddy icon is of Hanson] Dez: hey Dez: yah Dez: haha Me: lol Me: They kick ass Dez: haha hell yeah!  So that has basically been my morning. Oh, I am talking to Matt! Hehe. He is such a cool guy. I want to get to know him better, but I dunno what he wants. He is cool. Not much else is going on in my life. Prom is Sat. I am going with Corinn. I got my tux yesterday for like $102, which was WAY cheaper than Gingiss for Homecoming last year. The limo will be here at 5, dinner is at 6 at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant at Paris. It should be fun. I hope I enjoy Prom. Tickets are $80/couple. It better be good. Lol. Well I am outta things to say now. I may voicepost later today.  UPDATED at 6PM: So today I went to the mall with my mom. She got two pairs of shoes. Today has gone by SO SLOWLY! I think I am getting sick too, which sucks because Prom is Saturday. That reminds me, I have to buy my tickets tomorrow at school. Corinn said something nice. She offered to buy the flowers. That is cool. I am leaving the flowers to my mom, since she was in the floral industry for 20+ years. I am tired, so I am going to eat, then call Matt, and then go to bed. Sorry for not posting lately, I have just been swamped at work.
