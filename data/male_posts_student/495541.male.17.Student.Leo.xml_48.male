All I will say is that I messed up my ankle pretty bad and ended up playing on it.  I don't know why.  The last time I did that, it got so bad.  I don't even want to talk about it.  Sometimes I wish that I could just stay up longer, because I get in such a thoughtful mood that I just wish I had more energy.  I can't stay up much longer, though.  I have to get up early and take over my friends paper route.  I guess he's going out of town.  Anyways, it's times like this that my thought process is in such a position that I wish I could be in for longer to be more productive.  I'm not sure why I can't think like this when I'm awake.  But I'm tired.  Good night.  Is good night one word or two?
