Response of the other Americans: Bush, focus on our economic state. A lot of people live in poverty, do something about it. Response of Hippies: Make peace not love, nono wait, I'm screwing up...Shit, I forgot, I'm too stoned to remember our ideals. Response of foreign (non-American) Bush-haters: Look what he says, down with Bush. My response: Didn't I read almost the exact same line in 1984? (for the stupid people, that's a book)  Really, in 1984 George Orwell wrote about 'the party' who controlled 33% of the world and who kept the proletarions quiet by letting them hate the other two country's. They needed to think they were in the best country in the world.  The war could never be won, it was only necessary to keep the people calm. Back to Bush. Bush can never win the war against terrorism (and I don't mean that he's a criminal himself, he is, but we'll just ignore it). But as long as he keeps capturing potential treats the people will stay silent. When all the real dangers are gone he just creates them. For instance the fictional weapons of mass-destruction. The only weapon of mass-destruction is the TV. Or well, that's more of a weapon of mass-hypnosis. Come on, come on, into 1984...
