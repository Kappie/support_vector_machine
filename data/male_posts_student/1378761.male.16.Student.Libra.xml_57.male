We were out driving around and it was about 10:30. i was driving, and i was heading back into town coming in on 703 past villa nova. i hit a guys bumper, but luckily it was a big truck/suv and with my little car i went right underneath him, doing no damage to his car. When he first stepped out i was already out of my car, he had this scowl on his face, giving me the impression i just hit a big jerk. But to my benefit, i didnt. The guy turned out to be really nice and didnt call the cops on me so they wouldnt site me! I filly went to go look at my car and luckily i didnt do too much damage. prolly just bout $2000 of damage. I cracked my fender, crinkled my hood just a littl bit and scuffed the paint pretty bad. After i called my mom, and she was done yelling at me, i went and took my car home and eric looked at it. he kept telling me that it wasnt that bad and that i was so lucky it wasnt any worse. but at that point i was completely shook up, nothing could have been any worse! well we jumped in eric's car and he was attempting to try and calm down. at first his voice was just a blurr and i had so many things running through my mind. I was so afraid of what my dad was going to say, and eric was insisting that he would go with me, if it made me feel any better. i decided to wait, because at that time it was getting late and i didnt want my dad to be woke up and startled thinking it was something terrible that really wasnt. We drove around a little bit more, all in the meantime, eric was still trying to calm me down! he was such a big help! i cant express that anymore! we went and parked at the lake, just messing around and talking the whole time. finally it was 11:58 and i had to be home at 12. so eric busted to get out of there otherwise i was going to be late. it was ok though! i was having fun being with him! i didnt care how late i was going to be, i was relaxed finally, and enjoying being with eric! Sunday nite, was the fourth of july. me and rachel drove down to sidney picked up some of our friends and went to troy to watch fireworks. by the time it was half over we finally found a parking spot. afterwards we went back to one my friends houses and shot off fireworks until about 12:30. i spent the nite at rachels house and once we got home we made goodie bags up the swim team that she needed for the next day. so we hit the sack about 3:00 am. i had to be up early the next morning because i was going golfing. I came home got ready and took off for lima. after golfing my score was a 62. Par is a 32, so a 62 is really good for someone who has only ever played twice. afterwards, i went over to my cousins house and swam in their pond all day and had a cook out. it was a lot of fun because i got to see a lot of my family members i havent seen in awhile. that nite i went home and went up to sidney to hang out with some of the peeps up there and we ended up going to see more fireworks, and lighting more fireworks off. that brings me to today. Today was kind of boring. Eric came and visited me today! So i was pretty psyched out that! i missed him bunches! so it was a good visit! i had to work tonite, as manager, for my first time. it went really well. a lot better than what i was expecting it to be! we were pretty steady until bout 7 o clock. then we got hit pretty hard with a $400 hour, and only 3 ppl working! we did an awesome job! after closing eric came in and stayed wit me until i was ready to leave, then he walked me out! how sweet! eric stole some chicken, but we will keep that our little secret! heheh nahh, he just took some left over chicken.its all good! after that, i took the deposit to the bank, and talked with my mom for a little bit, came down and talked to eric on the net awhile, and now i am heading to bed. big day tomorrow, another boring day of babysitting, another day of agony! haha! welp good nite everyone! -ash-
