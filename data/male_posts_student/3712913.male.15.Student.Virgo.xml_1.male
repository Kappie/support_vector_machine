       
       Well, I've deleted my old blog and started this new one. If anyone would like to post on my blog please sign it so I will know who it was, or at least sign it if I know you. Also, I don't usually update my website because my host doesn't let me post more that about 1.5 bytes (or maybe it's megabytes) per image. I might switch to GeoCities though, since they are supposed to have a great deal for  free  hosting. That's all for now, I'll try to post every three to five days... though I'm not sure if I'll always be able to do that.
