I found it quite difficult to crack but I don't know about the rest of you.  The following scriptures were actually found in the diary of a 16th century englishman. You have to decode this. It decrypts (obviously) into English.     Frankly speaking I wasen't able to decrypt it without looking at the hint. Mail me at  urlLink abhijit89@gmail.com  for a big hint  Best of Luck! Hopefully you'll find this more time consuming than the previous one.  PS: Please don't check up the solutions from anywhere. Also please don't mail solutions on the blog. Mail them to me (again at  urlLink abhijit89@gmail.com ) if you manage to solve it.
