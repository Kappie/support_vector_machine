It would be sweet to have a series of like 4 or 5 short movies involving the same class of students...  -----------------------  The movie would begin with a professor assigning a project on something mundane - something like the pros and cons of school vouchers.     Everyone in the group gets excited - they all want to meet at Starbucks the next night and start working on it.   Once they're at starbucks they realize that they disagree on a lot of things and they're having a hard time getting organized.  When things get really bad, one of them decides they need to take the next step... and hire an expert.   Late at night, he meets the expert on a park bench in the middle of nowhere.  They exchange a few words, and he passes the expert's test.  He agrees to help the group.   At this point, I'm thinking there would be an awesome montage of the group doing research and creating a powerpoint mixed with physical military-type drills and trust falls and rope climb team-building type exercises.  An awesome 80s song would be playing in the background of the whole thing.  Maybe it would end with them partying at a bar or something the night before the big presentation.   Next, they're in the classroom on presentation day.  The scene opens at the end of another group's presentation.  The presenters did a really nice job, and so our group is intimidated.  The professor says that they'll take a short break and then the group will present when they get back.   They go outside to take a break, and they're real nervous.  Then, they think back to some of the things they've learned.  As they go back inside, there's a kick-ass slow-motion scene where they all look half-cool and half-nerdy as they walk in and give the presentation.   Then there are some clips of the presentation, and they do a nice job.  Another montage shows clips of group members dramatically pointing to charts on a powerpoint or slamming their fists down on the podium as they say something.  In the meantime, shots of the audience show classmates nodding and smiling enthusiastically as they take notes on the project.  The movie closes with a fade-out and then a fade-in to the expert, who is away on an island somewhere and gets a note from the group filling him in on the good grade they got.  Just as he receives it, he gets a cell phone call of another group who needs his help, and the movie fades out again.
