The fact that my parents were making me feel like shit didnt help much either. So that sent me into a downward spiral that lasted all last night and today. I ended up cutting myself again, something I abhor myself for doing cause it never helps, only causes me more pain that I already have. I can hardly even keep a fuckin coherent train of thought right now. I've lost one good friend and I feel that I'm pushing the others away cause I'm so depressed. I can't see any light in my life anymore. The darkness of emotion and life has stolen over me and pulled me down into its depths. I can't even be around hardly anyone anymore without feeling like I'm going to burst into tears cause of the lonliness I feel. Right now there's one person that could probably make me feel a little better, or just take my mind off of the pain, but she's not on and she has her own shit to deal with. Neither Andrew nor Allyse are on right now. Though I think I may have fucked up with Allyse. Big fuckin surprise there. I always fuck up, always. I can't think straight right now I'm so depressed and tired. Yeah work sucked too, but that's a given. *sigh* Oh well. Life fuckin sucks. Thats a fact. I'm alone and always will be. Another fact.   Right now...I really feel like I could take my life.
