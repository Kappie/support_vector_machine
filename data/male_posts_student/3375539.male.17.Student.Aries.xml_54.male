"You have many boasts, and though this argument has altered your consciousness, you remain irrevocably human. There is nothing special about you. Ergo some of my statements you will understand, some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your brains and muscles may be the most pertinent to you, you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant. Denial is the most predictable of all human responses, but rest assured, your choice of denying to accept what I said will constitute an escalating probability of your death and beyond. The inevitability of your doom is apparent to everyone now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being, with yours being your ever-so cocky attitude. Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and your existence on this planet revealed as both beginning and end. Nobody is ever perfect. Stop your cockiness."  wow.. de english so pro.. i go memorise den i king liao.. haha.. :P
