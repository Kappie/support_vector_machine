For reasons none other than a super-sized dose of paranoia caused by the inhalation of smoke made by combusting a certain green herb, I shall call him Jizza. It's 4 a.m. in the morning and I'm just about ready to call it a day. I decide to call it Thursday, cause it has a nice ring to it.  This motherfucker who moved in next door outta nowhere is playing the most shitty club music on his 1000W JVC system. It's naturally interfering with the mellow, yet hauntingly beautiful sounds of A Perfect Circle piped from my speakers. If anyone knows me by now, one thing I can't stand is shyte techno music. But now, there's one thing I can't stand even more than that... shyte techno music from another room overlapping my music...  At 4 a.m. in the morning... when all is quiet outside. The moon is at its brightest. There's a soft, gentle breeze wafting in through the window. The shadows in the room are subtle. And there's a paper-thin film of yellow light filtering in under the door. The song "Vanishing" begins...  "Disappear... Disappear. Higher... Higher. Into the air... slowly disappear. No... no longer here."  Yeah, someone's gonna disappear in a real hurry if they ever play their fucked up music into my room again at 4 a.m. in the goddamn morning.
