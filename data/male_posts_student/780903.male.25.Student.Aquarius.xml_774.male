His posts have inspired me to share what I have seen in my year and a half at law school.  If you've ever looked around a law school campus and wondered how you could look like the students there -- frazzled, tense, and borderline paranoid -- now, for the first time, you can learn the secrets to the physical side of law school success.  Why more workout tapes are filmed on law school campuses than anywhere else.*  Why the Abercrombie  Fitch catalog was filmed on Harvard Law School's campus.**  Why lawyers live longer than virtually anyone else.***  * = Not true. ** = Definitely not true. *** = Nope.  The (Secret and Amazing) Law School Nutritional Plan: "For A New You to Sue!"  BREAKFAST Seven cups of coffee, black (For extra benefit, make the coffee too hot, spill it on yourself, and sue somebody) Institutional donut, glazed  MID-MORNING SNACK Twizzlers (from vending machine) Eight more cups of coffee, black. Caffeine pill Crack  LUNCH Pre-wrapped cafeteria sandwich, extra mayo Three 20-oz. bottles of Diet Coke Institutional donut, glazed Ballpoint pen, by accident   MID-AFTERNOON SNACK Potato Chips (from vending machine) Four more bottles of Diet Coke The bitten-off head of a little baby bird  DINNER Cup O'Noodles (Beef flavored), uncooked (boiling water takes too much time) Bowl O'Cheese, for calcium "Coffee Cola" -- four cups coffee mixed with three bottles Diet Coke, plus five tablespoons Red Bull and a shot of Vodka  Repeat DINNER as necessary throughout the evening  WEEKEND BONUS MEALS:  "Law School Salad" -- the weeds growing outside your window, use the window moisture as dressing (no time to cook or go to the store -- need to study!)  "Mystery Meat" -- either from cafeteria or from dumpster in front of the library that you can quickly scour in your rush to make it to the circulation desk before the old exam answers are stolen and secretly altered by a classmate  "Recruiting Bonus" -- all the mini egg rolls you can eat without retching, at any of eighteen receptions per evening  "Recruiting Bonus 2" -- all the "Coffee Cola" you can drink, FREE at these receptions!  "Recruiting Bonus 3" -- rejection letters on toast.  Delicious.  "Recruiting Bonus 4" -- blood from a lawyer's eyes.  Just wait until they've been awake for 60 hours straight and it's a vampire's feast!  AND FINALLY, THE EXERCISE PORTION OF THE PLAN:  Turning a page in a casebook burns 0.04 calories.  Read a 1000-page casebook and burn 40 calories!  Amazing!
