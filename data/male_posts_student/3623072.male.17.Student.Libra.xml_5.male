Anyhow, i didnt get enough sleep today hehe cos i slept like 5.30 a.m. cOS The whole night i was chatting with My  "Close Frend", Emily  to occupied my time besides i was so bored dat nite so wat the heck. Hehehehe And I woke up like twice this mrning, cos there someone calling at home which really bugs me cos the phone was at the side at the bed and u wats worst, the person called had the wrong number, my god!! It really ruined my dream. I know u must be wondering wat i was dreaming; well i was dreaming about my gurlfrend really. Kissing here and kissing there~~ U know wat i mean. Really miss her tho. As i woke up, my target was switched on my pc and my modem. Then after my pc was on, my frend emily greeted me in My yahoo messenger.. So i end up chatting with her again.hehe She really amused me with telling story and stuff and sometimes we compare our life in our own country which really fun + she really knows how to entertain me. So i ate and sat infront of the pc for hours chatting with her without bothering to go out from my room. Hehehe   Then in the afternoon , nothing much happen. Just continue study fo my ASEAN test which is coming soon. Planning to full speed my study over taking 2 topics in one day. Unfortunately, my laziness conquered me and i end up lasting only 30 minutes reading half a topic. hehehe Later in the afternoon i then do some execrise to clear my mind and also i was feeling a bit sick with my usually common flu. After that, i felt much better. Then the guy last nite that pissed me off, apologised to me just now for being overreacting.So I was planning later tonite,i'll forgive him.. hehe I really dont want to end up having an enemy for life. hehe Tats me..   At night, my family decided not to eat dinner home and ate dinner at my closest cuzzies place in the whole wide world hehe.. Its really been a long time didnt eat together with my cuzy at the home. Kinda miss that cuzon and cuzon sPecial moment.. Wat m i saying..??? hahaha oh.. when we got back from my cuzzies place, i missed the !st fifteen minute of wwe raw. :/   My views on WWE RAW:                                                 Wat i managed to watch wen i arrived at home was HBK being tortured by that damn Kane. Wat the hell that he wants with HBK? Its really a horrifying moment to HBK Injured. I just really dont want to describe it anyway.                 The 1st Match was: A  TAG TEAM MATCH. Trish(c)  Tyson Tomko Vs, Matt Hardy  Lita.  And Lita and Matt Hardy defeat Trish Stratus and Tyson Tomko. Yay! hehe Really proud of Lita! She pinned that Slut Trish. Hahaha                The 2nd match was : A  TAG TEAM FLAG MATCH. La Resistance'(c) Vs. The Hurricane And Rosey.  La Resistance(c) def. The Hurricane and Rosey by cheating. I dont know but u guys, but i really support La Resistance'. I shud they are the one of the dirtiest tag team in wwe. hahaha *salutes* Go La Resistance'!!         Wat really questioned me is Lita. She is  Pregnant?!  Wat The hell?? I wonder who she have sex with. I hope is not Kane cos she might end up with A Baby Zombie. Hahaha  The 3rd Match was A Tag TEAM MATCH AGain!!!. Stacy Kiebler and Nidia Vs. Gail Kim and Molly Holly . Gail Kim and Molly Holly def. Nidia and Stacy Keibler by Submission. No comment on that cos Gail Kim, Stacy Kiebler and Nidia are my favourites hehe..           The Main Event Was.  An Elimination Tag Team Match. Chris Jericho , Benoit (c) And Edge Vs. Randy Orton (c), Batista And Ric Flair . Awesome Match.. It took more than 30 minues in this match. 1st to Be eliminate was Batista by both 3 finishers of the 3 opponents and was pinned by Jericho. 2nd to be eliminate was Chris Jericho by An RKO (randy Orton)pinned by Ric Flair wen the referee didnt see it. 3rd was Edge by an RKO and pinned by Randy Orton. 4rd to be eliminate was  Ric Flair by a Cripple Crossface by Benoit and Lastly was Randy Orton by a Sharp Shooter by Benoit.  I shud say this week raw is about Tag Team match majority. hehehe  Ok Till Next Time,  Hazim xoxox
