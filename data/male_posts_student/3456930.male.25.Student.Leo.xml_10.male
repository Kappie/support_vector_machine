What brought me to this conclusion was a number of things that have occurred over the last couple of days. Well, these things actually cemented my opinion as I already had a pretty good idea that I am a Driver.  The first thing was being a Passenger in a car that was being driven by my flatmate, Matt. Now, I have nothing against Matt and his driving other than the fact he tends to drive like an old lady. Way too cautious and not a lot of forethought about where he's going and the like. Like I said, I have nothing too bad against it. I'm just finicky.   The second incident, and the one that is the more important of the two, happened tonight on my way home from uni. Bronny, a girl from my course, gave me a lift home. Basically, we almost had a rather nasty accident because she's not overly confident about her driving. And when you drive a 35 year old Valiant that is nothing short of being an APC on the front line, you REALLY need to be confident about your skills. The imaginary brake was being stomped on quite vigorously on the trip home. Particularly when she went to change lanes and almost took out a little plastic two door hatch.   I think what it comes down to is that I like to be in control. I need to be in control. I need to have some say into how I'm going to live and die. If I'm behind the wheel and I'm the Driver, then at least I know if anything happens it'll be my own damn fault and not someone else's.  I know I'm a Driver. Others should remain Passengers and let me do the driving. We'll get there quicker and with fewer injuries.   People who flip their cars on the M4 should particularly remain as passengers or keep to public transport.
