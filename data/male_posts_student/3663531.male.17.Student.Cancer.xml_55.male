One followed the lines of calling a man handsome... and the other odd lyrics I noticed were  "It's a hard act to swallow'    Put together calling a man handsome, the words hard and swallow, and you have some home-grown genuine certified homosexual innuendo.    Hummm.....    Note: The author wished to use the term bona-fide but was advised that this would have made the post overbearing.
