She brings me Manga I've never heard of just because, yeah, just because. And my girlfriend watches Anime with me. She's so shy. Intimidated. I know that she needs me, but not half as much as I know, I need her. I know there'll never be another guy that she'd prefer. and when I feel like giving up, like my world has fallen down, I sign onto AIM. She's still up watching adult swim and I can hear her pretty voice. She always gives me the right advice and I know that everything, know that everything, know that everything, everything's gunna be fine.I know that everything, know that everything, know that everything, everything's gunna be fine. And my girlfriend walks with me when it's too dark to see and it doesn't seem to matter that I'm not all muscley. She laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does. She plays tennis and guitar oh yeah, she's my dove, yeah, she's my dove. And when I feel like giving up like my world has fallen down I sign onto AIM, She's still up watching adult swim and I can hear her pretty voice, she always gives me the right advice and I know that everything, know that everything, know that everything, everything's gunna be fine. I know that everything, know that everything, know that everything, everything's gunna be fine!  Ok, I know it's a total rip off of "Josie" but this is what I really want in a gilrfriend although it isn't that important that she plays the guitar ^_^;;
