But anyway, I can't stand how selfish I am with myself. Now, I know this is typical human behavior but I don't think that excuses me or anyone else. Why is it that we expend love and affection on people that we already know and care about, rather than people who we don't know and/or don't like? It's egotistical. We're usually friends with people who share a lot of our own qualities or interests, right? In a lot of ways it's an extension ofmy love for myself.I thinkmy friends aremore worthy of my affection because they're  better  than peopleI don't like ... because they're more like  me . Why should I treat my friends differently than I would treat a complete stranger or an outright enemy? I know it's normal to do this, but it just doesn' t make sense. I hate being bound to my humanity. It's one thing to spot the things that are wrong with human nature, but they're impossible to fix. They're too deeply rooted. They're too big for me and it's a humble reminder that I'm not God, which is probably why it's important to recognize those faults. I just thought of another egotistical human tendency that is pretty unrelated to what I was just writing about. (Aside from the 'egotistical' connection, that is.) Whenever I'm not good at something, I'll excuse it with a statement like, "Well, it's just not my gift." But if I'm really good at something, I'll either praise myselfor downplay it so that people will praise me more. "No, I'm not that great at _____." Notice the use of the term 'gift.' My talents are no great accomplishment of mine. I was simply born with a tendency toward certain things. God gave me certain talents along with the knowledge that Idamn well betterput them to use for him. So to downplay my talents is to belittle God's gift to me, but to praise myself is giving myself undue credit. I can no more take credit for my talents than for the color of my hair. What's more, I envy other people's gifts. Being human is an absolute nuisance. I wish I could get a move on and become perfect. You know, I just looked over what I wrote and realized that none of this should really be a revelation to anyone. But that's the problem with our American way of thinking: if it's not new material, it's probably outdated and untrue. Well, while this may not be revolutionary or spectacular, it is what it is.
