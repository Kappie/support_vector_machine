Ok, I am going to try and remember what I wrote.  Sorry about not posting Wednesday.  I decided I would rather play Alex's barbarian so he won't get deleted ever again.  I lost some gems in the process, but eh.  Ok, I repeal my 'fuck you' to Alex, since he fixed my links because I was too lazy to do hyperlinking in html.    Then I also decided to replay Max Payne 2 because there is a secret happy ending in Dead on Arrival mode.  But this makes me angry For those of you who don't know who Max Payne is, or what 'Noir' is, let me explain.  "Film Noir (literally 'black film or cinema') was coined by French film critics who noticed the trend of how dark and black the looks and themes were of many American crime and detective films released in France following the war. It is a style of American films that first evolved in the 1940s, became prominent in the post-war era, and lasted in a classic period until about 1960.   Film noir is a distinct branch, sub-genre or offshoot of the crime/gangster sagas from the 1930s (i.e., Little Caesar (1930), Public Enemy (1931) and Scarface (1932)), but different in tone and characterization. The criminal, violence or greed elements in film noir are a metaphoric symptom of society's evils, with a strong undercurrent of moral conflict. Strictly speaking, however, film noir is not a genre, but rather the mood, style or tone of a film."  For more info on film noir, or noir in general, go  urlLink Here   Max Payne started out living the American Dream, living in the suburbs of New York with a somewhat nice job of being a boy in blue (a cop).  One day he decides to stay a little longer at the precinct rather than go home to his wife and baby girl.  That was a life changing mistake.  He comes home to find his house has been 'redecorated' by Valkyr(an LSD/PCP type amphetamine drug) junkies under mafia guidance.  He sees his wife and baby girl dead and takes vengeance on the junkies in the form of 9mm bullets to their faces. From that day forward he works on the DEA to pursue Valkyr cases and mafia activity.  Soon, he is asked by his partner to go to a subway station to get some new undercover information.  However that subway is currently the seen of a bank robbery and his partner is subsequently murdered in front of Payne before they can speak about the new lead.  Payne is then the primary suspect in the murder, so he becomes a fugitive cop with nothing to lose.  It may sound corny, but is really moving.  Keeping true to noir, he speaks almost in all metaphors and some seriously messy stuff happens to him.  He goes on some bad Valkyr trips, he is betrayed several times by the mob and the force, and finally winds up in a government plot which he somehow escapes practically unscathed.  Unless you want to count his emotional scars and demons that haunt his spirit from the hundreds of people he was forced to kill.  Then he is pretty scathed.    Anyway, in the second one, his tale starts in a flashback, then another flashback to start from the real beginning.  He moved back to the NYPD and becomes involved in yet another murder/mafia scheme and meets a femme fatalle on the way.  In the end, hallucinations, falling 5 stories, kill people and all, Max loses the only other person he loved.  And finally he understands his pain the hard way.     Now HOW IN THE HOLY HELL ARE THEY GONNA TURN THAT INTO A HAPPY ENDING??  Its not true to noir!  Ok, the above paragraphs were really lame, but if they made a Max Payne movie, I would see it 56261236 times.  Ok now to me.  I have been feeling like utter shit for the past two days.  I got a cold from someone, but they are forgiven; its just a cold, right?  Well this one makes me feel as though Satan himself forced his clawed and gnarled hand down my throat and decided to give me a neck masage (*voice like Max Payne)  Then I decided to wash my face, which wasn't much of a decision at all.  It was more a choice like, "Hmm, I have to shit, should I?"  Of course I should. So anyway I washed my face and applied Tazorac. 3rd time in 24 hours or so.  Here's a point of future reference: ONLY APPLY TAZORAC IN 48 HOUR INTERVALS.  I could not sleep last night because my face felt like a thousand fire ants had decided to make war for control of "Wesley'sfacia".  My face is red, flaking, and cannot be touched.  Also I shaved last night before applying tazorac, dunno if that was good or bad.  Needless to say I stayed home.  So to make myself feel as though I had a little control over how much utter fecal matter was flung at me from above, I decided to take my permit test today.  Since yesterday my papers were missing, but today I have them.  But then as I walk over to where the DOT is located in the mall, I notice that the door is closed.  This fucking fat cop bitch tells me to come back monday, since it closed 3 minutes ago.  BITCH WHAT IN THE FUCK?!?!  THIS TEST WILL TAKE ME TEN FUCKING MINUTES.  LET ME THE FUCK IN, CAN'T YOU WAIT TEN MINUTES TO GO HOME AND EAT YOUR KRISPY KREME DONUTS??! HUH?! HUH??!  So now that I am in utter pain and my spirit is crushed because I can't get my permit I'm sitting here thinking about fate.  In fate, isn't every action justified?  As such, me getting sick?  Me getting my face fucking Acided off (new word.)?  Me getting denied the chance of getting my permit when I want (the picture would've sucked, I guess)?    The only person that could possibly benefit from that one is that fat cop bitch.  She probably enjoyed getting home to her vibrator and fucking donuts right on time. She probably derives pleasure from  1.  Letting herself get fat and hairy 2.  Vibrators 3.  And denying good people like me the chance to get a simple piece of plastic when I want  In a situation like this I would've lit up a bowl or two of weed.  But I'm not about to do that.  I changed an don't need it to make me feel better and grasp my situation better.  In short, the world has taken a shit on my that only one thing can probably make me feel better.  And it will be tomorrow.  Anyone want to talk about this?
