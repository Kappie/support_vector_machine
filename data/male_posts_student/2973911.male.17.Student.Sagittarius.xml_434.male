I'm sure he'll be more active.  Will someone check out  urlLink Freaky Dreams ? I was reading it in a newspaper somewhere but I don't have to time to check it out. I'm rushing.  Pablo,  Just wing it! We change topic from time to time. It depends on what's happening in our lives. Days of our Lives... Hah ha! They used to air that in a local channel and no one understood it. I wonder if anyone actually watched.  Jer, How can it be a scrabble game if it's not a scrabble game? It's not logical.  Jed,   Lay off the coffee or you'll find yourself older than you should be. Oh? That was you? I thought it was someone else. Why do you guys keep adding x to your usernames? Now I'm interchanging you and I'm not entirely sure who I'm talking to. Sorry for being a snob. I would have said hello and talked to you if I realized it was you. I thought it was Mark. You guys don't know him except he owns one of those 'swinging' yahoo groups that leaves me cold. Ugh!
