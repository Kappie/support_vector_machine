If you're is in my DT class (you know who you are) could you please fax or give me a copy of the windmill task. Bennet is being tight and won't give me a sheet unless i show him some game site i was supposedly at (apparently he liked one of the games i was supposedly playing). So if you have a copy could you please send it to me or give it to me at school. thnx  To finish this off i'll recount my day 5th period onwards. During 6th period Stevie experienced what can only be described as "groin cramps". He was in considerable pain and because it was funny watching him rolling his head around on the table i started laughing as well. And because my muscles were completely wasted from the athletics carnival laughing caused me pain. Because i was in pain he started laughing at me and because his muscles were in the same condition it caused him even more pain. So both of us were rolling around in fits of muffled laughter and pain. FUN!! FUN!! FUN!! Later at Gordon station waiting for the bus James and Ben had the brilliant idea to play charades. Imagine 7 people playing charades at a bus stop. Repertoire included Scorpion King, Catch Me If You Can, Cats, Cool Runnings, Princess Diaries and an amusing Titanic (won't mention who did what though). Probably won't here from me in the next coupla days, but if you do then i'm probably not as busy as i thought was.  g'nite pplz
