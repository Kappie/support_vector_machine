I found how to do the title feature, and as you may or may not (depending on what the difference is) have noticed that is what the title is this time. I may or may not keep this. If I do it might change how it looks, and it might feel inconsistent, but I will try not to change to much. I actually went through a short "custom phase" where I wanted to kind of customize my Blogger more. I figured it's great the way it is. I have always liked the black background with the white foreground (text). Anyways, this is only a test. Do not adjust your screen, we are not experiencing any difficulties.  **UPDATE** I have decided that I will use the title bar. The only difference is that it keeps the title in one spot, so I don't have to scroll up to refer to it. Also, tomorrow night, I have music class, since this class is boring I might write another chapter in  urlLink The staffs of Good  Evil  (my story; henceforth referred to as TSG).
