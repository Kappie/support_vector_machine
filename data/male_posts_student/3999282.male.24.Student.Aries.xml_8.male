During that conversation, I found out that what I mean to him is just a cheque with $8,000 on it. So I decided to "fire" him, that is, not to choose him as my financial representive. I will talk to another asian guy called Cedric tomorrow at 12pm and hopefully he is a nice guy who cares about me instead of my money. After the mutual fund investment stuff, I really have to go back to study for my molecular biology since I am way way behind.
