I have learnt from my mistakes which were:  1. Roomates 2. Lack of transportation 3. some lack of confidence  Like anyone else I am entitled to my mistakes, but thankfully I have been granted the luxury to try again and to do things right.  It is anyone's guess how things will unfold this year- I believe I will succeed, and become a better person for it.  It has been a crazy weekend, and my head is still spinning, I have learned a great deal- and really gone through a lot of emotions. I am nervous and excited about the opportunities that lay before me, we shall see how things turn out.
