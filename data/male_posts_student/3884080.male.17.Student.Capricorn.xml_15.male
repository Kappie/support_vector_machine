Im very bored, im waiting around my house watching televsion. im waiting for shane to get done with work so wecan go to waynes and from their were all going to milwaukee to stay at waynes dads for the night and tomorrow were going to warped tour! Hurray! i cant wait, man im pumped i mean come on. I finally get to see my favorite band, the one band that i think is better than every other band out there. yes folks you guessed it, im talking about Alkaline Trio. yes their going to be playing at warped tour and im going to be in the front row taking as many pictures as i can. God i hope they play sleepyhead and radio.  Im watching "Battlefield history of the United States Airforce"on the history channel. its a good show, but i dont really know why im watching it. I guess its because the tv was already on that channel when i turned it on but who knows.  Oh man my toe hurts, its all blistered and bloody and scabbed and it hurts to move and it hurts to walk and i keep having to pop blisters. Its probably infected with something but im to much of a lazy ass to do anything about it. watch it will fall off in a couple of days and then i will be screwed. But until that happens i will keep being lazy.  Im hungry, i want barbecue chicken and mashed potatos and ribs. Thats what i want.........but i dont have it
