I sang 28 out of 31 songs, songs I had either had or picked up from knowledge of a setlist I found that was very accurate. Goddammit, they didn't play Leave That Thing Alone. But it was okay, because Neil's new drum solo kicked so much fucking ass it made up for it.  Geddy of course was spot on, almost all the tunes sounded like they came from the albums.  The  movies throughout the show were hilarious. *does the macarena*  Oh yeah. Alex's Strangiato rant was so intensely random it was crazy. Fuckin' funny stuff.  "Nahnah-nah-nah-nah nahhh"  And his guitarring was sublime. I didn't know someone could tear up the strings like that. His playing is inhuman!  Well, since I'm so hyped I can't really think straight, I'll pro'lly post more clearly about everything later. See you people later.
