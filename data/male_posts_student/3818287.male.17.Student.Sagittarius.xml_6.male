I don't mean to sound like that British tart Simon Cowell, but it was boring! And then trying to get home was a nightmare. Me and my pal Justin almost got lost in Provo because Utah has the satisfaction of having the WORST drivers in the country, probably even the world. No one stopped for stop signs, red lights, or da police. I think the fact that we were listening to Creedence Clearwater Revival saved about 14 people I wanted to shoot. But that's life, so live with it. Well, my ranting must come to close now. I'm off to see Farenheit 9/11. Will the movie live up to the hype? I'll let you know! Peace out,  Chris
