" or the most disturbing as of yet... Led Zeppelin's "Stairway To Heaven" which reveals some very freaky  urlLink satanic messages . Even freakier is the fact that it's several verses and seems to make sense, unlike the one-liners from other artists.  There are many more out there which I don't know of. Someone told me once that The Beatles had one song with weird messages too, but I haven't been able to confirm this.
