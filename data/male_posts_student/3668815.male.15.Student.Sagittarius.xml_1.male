Some friends take good stuff from others le , den forget bout it , and during the period of time when he jus got the thing , he will treat u damn nice , but after which , once he forgets bout it le , he treats u as if u are no longer a brother jus cos u cannot go out with them...   Do friends encourage u to be defiant to ur parents ? Are these real friends ?   Some friends , even after taking money , they even thought of returning u ASAP , they keep in touch oftenly , and do not leave u behind or talk behind ur back , they do not ask for much , and usually treats each other equally. These Friends are the Good friends. These ppl , u can share ur problems with , and hang out with , even giving them money without asking much. As these are the friends i consider long-term friends, where they will never EVER forget u..  Well... i've always been generous , giving them whenever they need money , even when i do not get to eat the food at the chalet , i gave them , hoping that they cherish our friendship , but , sadly speaking , they took it for granted .   Haiz.. i really got nth to say le.. jus really dunno if i sld cherish the friendship anotz...
