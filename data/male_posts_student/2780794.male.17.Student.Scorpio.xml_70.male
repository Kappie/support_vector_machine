After a series of friendlies and trainings, the IVP players committee has drawn up a draft of players as well as their lines for the coming IVP. Please take note that there is no favouritism involved and all players are selected according to the three criterias' of attendance, desire and level of skill and discipline. The selected players should also remember that they could still be dumped from the squad if they lose their level of discipline. Best of luck to all players and train hard.  Evangelista Torrico Team Manager of IVP Squad.
