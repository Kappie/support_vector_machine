Scavenging through my empty cupboards for something,  anything , to appease my post-lunch-pre-supper cravings, I stumbled upon several canned goods - pineapple slices, tomato soup, and creamed corn. Alas, each of these tins proved to be a veritable Fort Knox, denying my entrance, namely because I don't actually own a can opener.  Surely there must've been something else! Inside the freezer I eye a box of microwave burritos, but, Vermillion Hells!, I don't happen to own a microwave.  Oooh! Oooh! Maybe these few pouches of  Carnation Instant Breakfast  will...er...no milk, eh?  *eyes last remaining box of  Kraft Dinner * Oh right, no milk...  *fridge laughs in response to my obvious suffering* "You've got no margarine either, fucker!"    Currently: Gathering change for Toonie Twosday at KFC.
