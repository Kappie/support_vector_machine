Whats more is that theres about 15  people in this "movie", half of them dont know it and NONE of us have seen the bloody script. wierd or what? Its this kind of thing that makes me question the worlds sanity.   ALL I WANNA BE IS A F**KING REGULAR GUY WIV A DECENT JOB AND A COOL HOUSE WEN I GRO UP. NOT ONE OF THEESE COLLYWOOD FAKFACES HOO IS IN EVERY SINGLE EPISODE OF MISSION MARS BUT COULDNT TELL THE RED PLANET FROM HE MOON IF IT WAS SHOVED UP HIS A*S!!  Im so bored, someone plz contact me it wud be so nice to talk to a human rather then a deserted weblog and a couple of searchbots and a computer  it gets really boring after a while!
