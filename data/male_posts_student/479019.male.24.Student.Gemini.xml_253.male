Some of the stuff Dr. King talked about really made me think about my paper from a different perspective, but I think I may be drifting too far away from the legal aspects of globalization, which my topic is on. I need a way to explain the relationship between to "things" in the superstructure and how it's involved in globalization. The Marxist way of looking at things is relatively easy to think about, but I just need to figure out a way to verbalize it. I think a Weberian perspective might be interesting... culture and rationality...  I feel really tired, despite it being kind of early for me.  In rotation right now is some  Green Day .  ***
