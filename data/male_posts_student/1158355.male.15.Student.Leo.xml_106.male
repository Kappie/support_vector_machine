I kicked some ass in Puff N' Putt Mini Golf. Ya, so the whole time I hung out with Peter. These people have a house, my mom's friend family. So Pete and I met some hot girls the first day, of course me doing all the talking. But we ditched them, well we couldn't hang out with them because we weren't allowed to go into town which was where they were and where we were supposed to meet them. On the last day we met some girl named Kealy, she was cool but we once again never met up again with her but we got her sn! Woot! Ok screw this Montauk talk. Let's talk about Six Flags! Six Flags was crazy, us guys (fathers, my cousin dan and I) were online for All American Scream Machine and right as we were about to go, the whole park shut down. BLACK OUT! Black dudes were cussin' and sewin'...my cousin Jenna's boyfriend Matt was stuck on the ride. Everyone was evacuated, just imagine the people that had to sit in a car for an hour on the top of the crank on Nitro and on a loop on Superman. Ya well many people left but a million people still stayed including us. It sucked because I wasn't feeling good because the day before I ran around 10 miles with Keith without eating anything healthy. 711's SLURPEE MACHINE WAS OUT OF ORDER!!! I was pissed. Ok, so back to Six Flags, we saw this Matrix Lemonade dude...it all started when I decided to ask if the lemonade was real (like homemade) and he said "No the Matrix is telling you it's real" and I said "Hey Dan, he's a believer" and he said, "Psh! Belief"...then he's like..."uh...well...you see...oh god im so random...i just think everyone here hates me....god...its not fair..." Britt, Dan and I are cracking up and he mumbles "i just want somebody to love me." Obviously this guy had major issues. He yelled at Britt for laughing at him. Then he dropped the $5 and he got mad. Then I asked where the straws were and he was like "BOX!" Yea...Nitro definetly was the best ride, nothing beats it. Superman was alright. Ok, enough Six Flags. When I got home from Montauk I hung out with Dan, Pat and Jimmy since forever. We smashed a pink toilet in the sump. Then went to Pat's, watched a bit of Family Guy, then Dan had to go. Jimmy, Pat and I decided to go swimming in the boat on the Nissequage...Keith remember? But it was gone. Thank god it was gone because if it wasn't gone I wouldn't of made contact with my dad and I would of been left home while my parents went to my cousins and I just realized this now. Ok, so we walked to the part thats naked in my neighborhood, getting all ready for new houses, and we checked out the Lion King Tree...and jumped on a huge pile of mulch. Then we went back to my house and saw THE SOPHEMORES...that how you spell it? Ya wait a second, I'm a sophmore...oh well. OK! Paul it would be nice if you stop wearing those gay wife beaters. Well we saw the whole crew, it was Paul, Ricky, their soccer friend, Justin and Shapiro...wanting me to play Ultimate Frisbee but I couldn't because I had to go to my cousins. So I showed Pat and Jimmy the GI Joe thing and a few other things including my new room and TV. After they left, I went to my cousins (the Murphy's)...there we had plain old fun. My dad had to drive out to Amityville just to get his phone back from this black lady who held it on reward...my dad ironically payed to get it back and took it out the easy and nice way. Usually he'd say "DIE NIGGER" and shoot the lady dead smack in the middle of her forehead, then continue to fight off all the other gangstas that come in his way. BACK TO THE COUSINS...ya we washed Katie's car and we all got soaked and in trouble haha. Britt and I also attempted to brush Vinny's (the dog) teeth but he kept biting us and the mitten protection still didn't work. Now I'm home and tired as hell and I'm catching up to all the updates I've missed on all the funny websites. Also talking to people like Heaton...well he's the only person I've had a chance to talk to yet...but I need to talk to a few other people...ANGELICA! haha oh well read me tomorrow night...I think?
