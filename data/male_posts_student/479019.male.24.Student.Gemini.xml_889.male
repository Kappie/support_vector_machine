It makes me wanna drown my sorrows with a bottle of Jack. I realize they had nowhere else to go but down after  Process of Belief . That album IS one of my favorite albums of all time. Well the European version anyway, the American version lacks "Shattered Faith." In truth a lot of my favorite bands have let me down recently. I guess it's because most of the bands I really like are in decline after being around for decades.  I still have no clue about my future, which is a let down as well. Well at least I have an idea of what classes I want to take.  Not a lot else to say. I've been a slacker as of late. Stay up late, waking up late... not working on goals I set for myself... that sort of thing. Jade had a point, when she was talking about life with no structure. I really need to find a job and take some classes this summer. That'll keep me on task better. At least I managed to get 2 pages of writing done today. So I have 8 out of 20 pages completed. So that means I need to write 12 pages in 4 days. It's do-able...  Oh yea I want to wish a happy b-day to my homeboy Kaho and to my buddy Crystal... As my time zone currently straddles their two birthdays.  ***
