The thing about black colleges, is they understanbly aren't THAT competitive.  Howard has pretty low admission standard, IMHO, but I'm sure they have quite a few dedicated students.  Is it worth it though?    Gah! That's one I'm never going to be sure about.  My mom was kind of pushing Morehouse though, but that's in Atlanta.  I don't know if I honestly could deal with being in the South, but then again guys who graduate there are bound for success.  Soooo hard to say.
