Students over the years have built up a reputation for being relentless party animals, engaging in bizarre nocturnal rituals to the detriment of community spirit. Mrs.Fields at number 4 has suffered during the past decade, she exhibits all the abnormal symptoms of a woman driven to the brink by countless irresponsible students frolicking in her neighborhood. The curtains twitch. I now understand why she wears her wrist supports. The decibel meter tells a sad tale, a tale of noise pollution. Mrs.Fields holds the patent for the world's first mouth catalyst, not unlike a doggy muzzle, to reduce pollution and return peace. Mrs.Fields is a campaign activist, a fervent lobby-group protestor, she demands action, and her voice is heard. Her hard-nosed, steely-eyed silence loving friends have established a revolutionary group to bring about change. The noise politics of 'noise ban' action group is to introduce a noise tax, charged to you by fax, since most telephones make a right old racket. 'Noise ban' action group have adopted sign language as their official form of communication, re-soled their shoes with rubber, banned angry outbursts, confiscated musical instruments, taking a dim view of mothers in labour, and frowning upon child-like exuberance. But a cow toleration policy has slipped into their manifesto unnoticed.  The students in 3 Bawden Close are an unusual bunch. We are mild mannered and quiet. We fall in line with noise party politics, keeping the regulations, thus avoiding unnecessary taxation. But of late we have begun a silent uprising, a protest in the heart. We have whispered about the cows at lunch. How they keep us awake with their incessant MOOING. Our heads hit the pillow before twelve, our eyelids shut at 3. Jim has resorted to sleeping pills, Becca opting for the double whammy of ear-plugs capped off with ear-muffs, Phil prays, and I suffer. A chorus of MOOING cows and the humidity of summer keep me awake in my green-house, tossing and turning, sweating and fidgeting the conscious nightmare of animals gone wrong drags through the night. I plot my revenge as I walk to uni the next morning, weary and bleary eyed, I catch glimpses of the multitude through the hedgerow. They cover the entire hill, some sauntering around in the sun, others chewing grass on the embankment. They seem happy, even though they have 5 bellies, weird digestion systems, awful problems with regurgitating, and mean methane. They are oblivious to my troubles. I was once informed by 'Patsy the Panther', an ardent green, who carried the spirituality of the animal kingdom, that all animals, even the ordinary cow, shared in our understanding of the world, and empathise with us in our sufferings. The hollowness of her demented green philosophies had struck me some 2 weeks earlier after spending 3 hours pleading and begging the cows to be quiet. The voice of reason, coupled with a bribe, a bag of freshly mown grass, brought with it a crescendo of MOOING and a highly unsatisfactory conclusion. Sleepless in Bawden.  So it's mainly cows, not a nagging conscience that keeps me awake. Our estate is mainly plastic, brick-work finished off with yards upon yards of glossy plastic. Our estate is called Hales Place. Many a taxi driver has refused to drive there after slurred pronounciations of the destination by prospective customers. The roads are full of pot holes, and the street lighting is always KAPUT. There are notices on every building; 'NO BALL GAMES', the kids play football, and run on top of garages. They peer through our patio window while we are having dinner, they scarper before we have the chance to invite them for afters. Mrs.Fields is fiction, and number 4 is occupied by a lovely lady. She commends us for our hard work in the garden and awaits the day we topple over the huge fir-tree that leaves her garden in the shade. Jean is at number 2. She is tanned throughout the year, a brilliant orange tan, covering her form head to toe. She loves a good gnome surrounded by pansies of all colours. She sings along to Whitney Houston love songs, and we all stop to listen. I don't think she can sing, but I like to hear her sign, I enjoy her singing. It is heartfelt, full of meaning, exploding with life.  Canterbury is amazingly peaceful, the cows eventually fall asleep, Jean finishes her singing, the TV lies dead in the cupboard, traffic comes to a standstill, and you are left with time. Time to be still, time to be quiet. Those moments when you ask tough questions, wait for answers, and meditate on the goodness of God.
