It seems apparent however, that the mind and body of an igneous rock, are as one corporeal mode, occuring through entirely naturalistic causes.  This is an interesting thought, but one question more interesting is whether rocks have free-will, or do they have predetermined destinies? I'm currently tending towards a Calvinistic view with regards to inanimate objects.  Ever wondered how Plato's  The Republic , would have turned out if Socrates had have been a 4 foot tall Panda Bear? I'm thinking it would have been a little different--- and rather hard to translate.  Edit: I've recently realised that having Socrates as a 4 foot tall Panda Bear would produce some logistical problems in ancient Greece, considering the climate and lack of cold water fish. It also may merely not have worked, considering that Socrates did have a speaking role
