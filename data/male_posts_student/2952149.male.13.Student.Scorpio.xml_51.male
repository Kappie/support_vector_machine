What that means is I better whatch my fuckin back when I am walking down the street lol. I also changed my blog template and I think it looks cool other than the purple text under "Archives" and "Recent posts" lol. So not much is really going on in my world right now....Stacey is moving soon and that is going to suck a lot. I feel bad for her because nothing seems to be going right for her in the past few weeks. My guitar concert is tomorrow so I won't be able to see her at all because the class is just going to hang out all day :( I really am not looking foward to dressing up for the recital but whatever. Bye.                             (*J*KK all the way) lol
