Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink I Miss You -Blink 182  Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #42  All the bubblegum punks who knew every lyric to “All the Small Things” should have seen it coming:  Blink-182  was going to try to mature. The best evidence of this is “I Miss You,” the second single from their self-titled 7th album. But as opposed to sounding artsy, classy, or even respectable, the song comes off as a punk-pop regurgitation of the  Smashing Pumpkins’  “Tonight, Tonight,” all the way down to  Tom Delonge’s  terribly annoying vocals (remember  Billy Corgan , the master of that art?). If  Blink  wants to mix their foul-mouthed roots with maturity, maybe the world needs its first song ever about erectile dysfunction.   The Verdict:  3.6/10 - Brouhaha   (1.8/5)
