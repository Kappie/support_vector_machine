I saw a couple of these last time I was in London, but on a rainy Wednesday night in Soho, they’re everywhere. Their Euroboy drivers hawk their trade in bad mawkish English. A few of them are actually English, so God knows what they tell their parents – probably the truth, namely that they’re just doing it for the Summer to clear credit card debts. Maybe they deal drugs to the passengers too – who knows. It’s a whole new world, based on that one Seinfeld episode with the same premise, except that in that they at least had the realism to accept that introducing rickshaws to a post-industrial city is a stupid idea. After what was basically a £20 tapas dinner, a tiny group of us was persuaded to go to a vodka bar called ‘Garlic and Shots’ in Soho. I only went because apparently they played death metal, which they did. Eight years ago, visiting this bar would have induced me to start making plans to move to London. Today, I just ask, where’s the hardcore? Found a magazine there called ‘Alternative London’ but it was all Camden Goth bullshit, nothing alternative at all. On the way out, they had Vices, which made me whoop with delight. The British edition seems a bit lamer than the Australian edition, but only because in the context of London the  urlLink Vice  agenda just seems like a fantasy that would be completely incompatible with actually living there. Also, I figured out why it is that all English children are not cute: it’s because they all have grade twos. Please: this is not a flattering hair-cut for a five year-old. There was this woman and a kid on the tube this morning, apparently not British. The kid was sprawling out with his back arched back. The mother’s response to this was to straighten him by basically punching him in the fucking guts, then strapping him in a fucking pram (even though he looked like he was about four) and appearing genuinely consternated as to why he was crying so loudly, and try to shut him up with a bottle of chocolate filth, which he wisely rejected. Then this apparently-Jewish older woman went over (she’d been trying to get involved in someone else’s business ever since she’d got on the train) and started trying to help. Maybe it worked – I don’t know because I got up and walked down to the other end of the carriage.
