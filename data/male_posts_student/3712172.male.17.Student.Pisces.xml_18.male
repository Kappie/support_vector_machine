Except for that fact that I work at 4 PM Monday to Friday. But I am not that lazy. I am still half dead, sitting here smoking a cigarette. I should probably go grab a coffee.  Mmmm, caffeine!   Work has been so damn busy these last few days. For those who know nothing of my part-time job, I am a customer service rep (supervisor) in a call centre. I am one of those "supervisors" that people talk to on those 1-800 numbers. I work for the T-Mobile Rebate Centre. The job is fairly good, pays good, but fuck, the customers I have to deal with over the phone are horrid at times. Customer service is an extremely stressful field of work. It's fun at times though.  I am probably going to go for coffee tonight with some people from work if everything works out as planned.   Tomorrow I am heading to the hospital where I did my co-op placement for last semester. Even though school is done I still want to pop in and volunteer every once in awhile. It's in the paediatric ward in our new hospital. It was an awesome co-op, I had a lot of fun, and gained a lot of insight in a career of medicine. Co-op is an awesome class to take.  I should probably go get some decent clothes on. I am suppose to head to my new house to help out, but I work at 4 so it may not be so feasible.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   I'll write later. Bye guys!
