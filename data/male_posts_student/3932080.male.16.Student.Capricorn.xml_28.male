Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Scandalous -Mis-Teeq Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #35 Never before has a summer single been so delightfully contradictory as Mis-Teeq’s “Scandalous,” both the headlining single to their self-titled US debut and the prominent trailer track for  Halle Berry’s   Catwoman.  Boasting an extremely sexy sound full of lush strings, digital bass wrinkles, and a distinguishing fire siren (the up-tempo update on Kelis’ “Milkshake” bell dings), the trio croons some harmonious lines that are surprisingly unsexy (thus the contradiction). A memorable lyric informs that “a one night stand just ain’t enough,” which means that the girls of Mis-Teeq either prefer meaningful relationships or just want multiple nights of sex with the same partner, although asking for “a little conversation” seems to assure the former. Actually, trumping the Spice Girls comparison (based solely on the loose British connection), the last group to ask for conversation was Salt-N-Pepa, who did so infamously back in 1991, except instead of using chatter to avoid a fast hook-up, they, well, asked to “talk about sex.” That kind of fucks up my comparison.   The Verdict:  9.6/10 - The Fork   (4.8/5)     2004 Best Singles Club Entry
