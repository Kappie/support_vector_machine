Woke up at 6pm today. Ran and worked out. Showered. Ate breakfast. Dressed. Got a bong with James, Kev, and Mike Bateman. Ate at McD parking lot. Make things out of clouds. Baked some more. Sitting here now listening to music..   Its crazy, I'm thinking just as long as you're around. In here I'll be dancing on the ground. Am I right side up or upside down? To each other, we'll be facing. My love, my love, we'll beat back the pain we've found. You know, I mean to tell you all the things I've been thinking, deep inside my  friend. With each moment the more I love you. Crush me, come on, baby...   I'm going to mellow out to the clouds and stars by the seawall now.. peaceee
