I went online and waited for Mother to come back with breakfast. She came back with chee choeng fun! I cna simply die! The rich flavour of chee cheong fun! I miss it! For weeks (okay...6 days), my life has been "chee cheong fun'-less! Today, I can finally eat the simple, yet superb dish! Ahhh! The taste leaves me wanting more and more..and more! Meow meow meow!  After breakfast, I went online. These days hor, I spent most of my time in MuggleNet Interactive. HaHa. Meowing moo. Then, I went to eat lunch (nasi lemak).   After lunch, it was gaming time. I played Priston Tale and managed to gain 2 levels. HaHa. Not easy you know. I finally got a new wand. YaY!! HaHa. At 2 something, I quit gaming and surfed online.  At 6, I bathed, and bathed till 6.40. By then, my father has not yet returned. This is sow unlike him. I called him and found out - GASP - that he's involved in another accident. This is so worrying. Second time within 4 days! The rain is really stupid. My father skidded and hit the metal barrier again. I HATE THE RAIN! I thought spring's here and there shouldn't be any more rain. Stupid global weather. It looks like we have to pay $1500+ for the damages. Sigh... I don't know how we can cough out that much man!  Dinner was a sordid affair. Okay, not really sordid, but it was strange without Dad around. Sigh! He came home around 8. So late! Meow moo! Sigh!! After watching TV, I came online lor.  Haiz. I think I end this entry le la. Got nothing to say le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
