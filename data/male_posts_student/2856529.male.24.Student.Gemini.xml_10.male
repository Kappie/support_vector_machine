Through this column I will share my pet peeves and the annoying little things that bother me with anyone who is willing to read my blog. So here is the first and in an ironic tone hopefully one of the very few topics that I will discuss in this column. I was watching television the other day and came across the new ads for Pepsi Edge and Coke C2, new entrants in the food and drink industry's race to capture mega bucks and pander to the low carb craze sweeping across the United States. That got me thinking. Whatever happened to all those products which touted the benefits of reducing the fat in your food? I dont see them around anywhere. In the supermarkets I can never find a low fat salad dressing but if I ever wanted a low-carb creation presto!! Fast food chains, coffee shops even ice cream makers are out to rid you of the carbs in your food. What am I going to say at Mc Donalds now. "Oh you can fry the potatoes all you want. Just make sure the potatoes are low carb!!". I dont get it. I just dont.
