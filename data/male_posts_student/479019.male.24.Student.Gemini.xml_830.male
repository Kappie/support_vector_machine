The Beatles were not really a political band in the same sense, but members of the band such as Lennon and McCartney were very political. The Sex Pistold on the other hand, their lyrics became the battle cry of both disenfranchised youth as well bored suburban kids. In their mobilization, there was a lack of the sophistication of a band like the Clash, who were more concerned with human rights lyrics than screaming, "anarchy," "no future," and "pretty vacant." Dead Kennedys on this side of the planet, were closer to Sex Pistols in their lack of any sort of coherent politics in it's criticism of American politics. They were pretty much saying fuck all American politics, without really stating what's specifically wrong with it. Other bands such as X-Ray Spex had some clever things to say about sexism and consumerism. Bad Religion commented on latch key kids, and religion. That's not to say these bands (or their members) weren't powerful voices for its listeners, but the real question is what sort of messages were they sending?   Now playing: Hot Hot Heat - Get in or Get Out  I think there's a lot of be said on the issue of politics in popular culture. For those of you don't know, it's somewhat of one of my areas of study in regards to media... although mostly in movies not music.  Something else that's been sort of my mind is Wal-Mart. I went there with Inhye this weekend for groceries and she needed to get windshield wiper fluid. If certain types of music are somewhat dumbed down in terms of politics (no offense to those bands, since I do like them), Wal-Mart is the pure retardedness of consumerism. It's amazing how that place with it's poor design, and crappy products can be one of the most profitable retailers in the world. Nevermind what scholars say about the intensification of design in high-capitalism, Wal-Mart is a living breathing Fordist enterprise. What's even more interesting is that when you go to Wal-Mart, you see the people that the sludge of American culture has enveloped. This is where you see working poor, who shop there because its cheap, but get sucked into the excessive consumerism of buying as much cheap shit as possible. They aren't really saving money, because they're buying a lot of junk, which is lots of unhealthy mass produced snack foods... which further their obesity.  Man I hate Wal-Mart... it's all that's wrong in this world, but alas it's cheap and I'm a poor student.  I woke up at 6:30 this morning... and I'm like all out of it. If things don't make sense... too bad.  ***
