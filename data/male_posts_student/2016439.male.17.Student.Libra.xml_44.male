This year's group is quite different from the rest: most are young, scared, and rather bland.  I have no problem children like in years past.  I have no outstanding recruits like in years past.  They're just kind of...there.  Now, this could change within the next couple of weeks, but...well, right now it's not looking so bright.  On a side note, do you ever get that feeling that your life may be spinning out of control and you don't even know it?  I've been having that strange feeling today.  It's like every once in a while, a light gust of air blows away a curtain that's hanging in front of my eyes, and I see things, and they aren't pretty.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just going a little crazy from the stress of school and stuff.  But...  It scares me.  Other than that, my day's been great, lol.  Life's crazy, and I'm learning to deal with it one step at a time.  I just know that I still have a lot of growing up to do, and when I think that I'll be leaving home within a year-and-a-half (and possibly FAR away), it's a wake-up call.  For sure.
