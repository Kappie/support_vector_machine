"A something is a something, if and only if it has the property of that something......"    actually this is from one of the subjects im taking in school...........basically it jus means that if something smells like a thing, it tastes like that thing, looks like that thing, it still might not be that thing.........that something might have properties of that something, but it may not necessarily be that something, but for it to be that something, it MUST first have properties of that something..............  lost? ya........so am i...........but the world hasnt ended so dun bother worrying abt something being something else and not being that something you think it is cos somethings jus arent wat they seem just becos it looks, smells and tastes like that something...............nvm...........
