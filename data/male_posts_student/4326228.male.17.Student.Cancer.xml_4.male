We have alot of classes together which is tight as hell becuase he is smart and cool.  2 of the classes are computer classes and we are like gaming buddies so it all works out great!  My Schedule is easy as fuck!!! but i have to talk about this health 2 class.  I have my health 2 credit but not my health credit and health is a sophomore class I belive so I wonder if they just put me in health 2 again for the hell of it.  What ever nothing to big.  I have a idea of how the school year is going to be, pretty much like last year except maybe a little more drama.  While I was standing in line for registration this girl came up to me (no names) and asked if I could hook her up with some herb.  BWAHAHA just like last year...  I  talked with only a few selected people that I wanted to and pretty much ignored every one eles. just like last year.  So this bong rip is for the school year.   Good luck to all and I better fucking graduate.  Oyeah and I got to trade my id card with this one girl.  She has a pretty ugly one of me and this one is still bad infact its really funny. But at least I'm not so danm ugly and scary in this one.  Just look really funny.  (God I hate pictures, people look better  in the real world, not on a piece of "paper")  I'm going to go, Downey and I are allready ploting stuffs for the school year belive it or not...  P.S. I did not get my licence today!  FUCk registration took to long then I had a doctors meeting so now I have to wait another week.  on the way back from the doctors I got to watch a cat get hit by a truck, My mother cried and I must say it is pretty sad but I'm going to take this as a reality check. I'M ALIVE!
