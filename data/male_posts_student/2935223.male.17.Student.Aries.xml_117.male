No one told us to stop.  Sumone could have. Sure, I felt  uber -bad about doing it at Ky's house in his living room.  Extreme happiness can do amazing things to reason.  All reason was gone.  What??  You people think I don't feel bad for Ky.  Sure I fuckin' do!  I know  exactly  what pain Ky is goin' through, but you people consider me heartless. I'm givin' a vote of confidence in the guy, it just happens to be in the cruedest way possible.  He can live through it, I know he can.  He's a big, strong guy, he can do this! fuck...I don't even know if it's worth it trying to stick up for myself and my reasoning.  You people don't give a damn anyway, you have pre-set opinions, and I'm not gonna change 'em.  Spense  P.S. Ky, if you ever read, this.  I'm sorry goddamnit!
