Country singer (of course)... this song was written as an assignment for his lyric writing class. (Write a song using the lyrics "Ashes, ashes, all fall down" from the nursery rhyme.) Wrote it outside the classroom right before class, ended up winning the John Lennon songwriting competition for it.  Great, great song.  "All Fall Down" - Ben McKay  So hot, early August-- first grade old news by now. Just a-runnin' and a-playin', next door neighbors, the best of friends-- We hide and seek til the day's end, singin'  "Ashes, ashes, all fall down," and we laugh and tumble to the ground, singin' "Ashes, ashes, all fall down,"  in the summer's warm embrace-- There's no better place than next to her as we all fall down.  So hot, early august-- senior year comin' up fast. As we stand in the doorway I see her eyes different than before-- Our hearts longin' for somethin' more, singin'  "Ashes, ashes, all fall down," and we laugh and tumble to the ground, singin' "Ashes, ashes, all fall down," in the summer's warm embrace-- There's no better place than next to her as we all fall down.  Fall in her arms, Fall through the years, Fallin' from laughter, Fall into tears. A husband and wife, joined together in joy-- a man and a woman,  a girl and a boy. Singin'   "Ashes, ashes, all fall down," and we laugh and tumble to the ground, singin' "Ashes, ashes, all fall down," in the summer's warm embrace-- There's no better place than next to her as we all fall down.  ----  If you wanna hear it, check out www.benmckay.com, and download it for yourself.
