Strangely enough I feel very confident.  Spanish has been extremely hard this semester, but in the recent weeks I have been doing very well.  That momentum will carry over into tomorrow's test.  I will destroy Spanish.  I fear nothing.  I have to relinquish my title of Iron Chef.  I was cooking a frozen pizza in the oven and I undercooked it.  It turned out terrible.  I hang my head in shame.  It may be a surprise to many of you, but one of my favourite sports is tennis.  I was watching The French Open coverage today and I was pleased to see some of my favourite players advance.  I like the underdogs.  Players no one knows like Xavier Malisse from the men's side and Virginia Ruano Pascual from the women's braket.  Malisse made an incredible run to the Wimbledon quarterfinals a year or two ago and Ruano Pascual plays doubles with partner Paola Suarez.  Ruano Pascual and Suarez are ranked first in the world in women's doubles.  Malisse won his third round match against Daniel Elsner and advanced with a 6-3, 4-0 (retired) win.  The Belgian will take on Albert Costa in the quarterfinals.  Malisse had to play double duty as he and Olivier Rochus advanced past Todd Martin and Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 2-6, 6-3.  Ruano Pascual won her third round match against 12th ranked Ai Sugiyama 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-1.  Ruano Pascual will face Francesca Schiavone in the quarterfinals.  Ruano Pascual also had to play two matches as she and Suarez easily advanced past Gulnara Fattakhetdinova and Galina Fokina 6-1, 6-3.  Now I must go to bed.  I'm tired and I have a huge final tomorrow.  The end is nigh.
