I love you so much that only 3 numbers can describe it 143!  Anyways I talked with Mrs. Thornley and she said that the ibooks have maintance problems like on the batter it juts out. So it looks like I'll be paying 1599.  Good news is that I know someone who  is intrested in the emac.  I dont know how I'll live without a computer!  Oh well always look at the glass half full!  I'll Call ASAP 143 iBrad
