But many of these fears mean nothing. They are but a mental barrier, and have nothing to do with physical factors. In other words, fears are totally unnecessary. Today, I had a rehearsal for my school Speech Day. I was to play the E flat Clarinet which was to me, like playing solo.(Cause I'm the only one playing that instrument, and highly audible. But I was fearful, nervous and all anxious. I tried to be soft to avoid attention. But instead, I attracted more attention on me. But on the second time, I decided to give it all out. Still there are mistakes, but it was really much better. But then, after that I felt so bad about my mistakes that I went to apologise. And he said I was ok!!! How often we worry for nothing. The more we worry, the worst things get. The Band was so pressured my the school's expectation of the Gold. They were afraid, so they had an 'enforced' attitude to the judging. But the more they tried to do well for everything, the worst they got. It's like how we never do well when in fear. So I guess we should just overcome these mental barriers and release out fullest potential of our abilities. Do not consider your fears, but be confident to prove yourself and not undermine youself.Do not let a one time experience result in generalization. But still, fear God! Fear as in reverence.
