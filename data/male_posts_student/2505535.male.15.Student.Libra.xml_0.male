But I got some Racer X and a cupa tea, so I'm alright. Alot of ppl have spotted me in Beanos, w0o! I am most proud, I must go there to see it myself. Seeing as I'm a *regular* hehe *proud*  I keep going to bed later and later, and waking up later and later, I'm gunna try and get back into routine in the new year.  Morrowind's going well, maybe I should play less of that.. it can't be healthy..... hehe
