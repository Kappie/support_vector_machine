The lovely girl with the big smile and bovine eyes (heehee - she hates that expression) would be Vicki, my Biology buddy.  That would be us.  In Biology.  Get'n our groove on.  That's what happens when Barry White comes on your walkman: you and everyone in a five metre radius seems overcome by Ally McBeal sydrome - the inability to resist boogyin' down to " The first, the last, my everything ".  Notice also the sexual reproduction posters so conveniently placed in the background. Hmmm...so that's where the labia are...  urlLink
