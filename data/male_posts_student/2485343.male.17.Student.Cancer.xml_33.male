I once heard of a superstition, the way you spend new years is the way you will spend the rest of the year. I hope im not alone the rest of the year. I don't know, should I change things to make people like me? Or should I stay the way I am and hope everyday that someone will like me for who I am. The problem is, I really don't know who I am anymore. I think that if you were to look at the way I have been my whole life, you could probably tell I have been playing follow-the-leader for quite a while. I think now though I have found a piece of who I am. I am too suppressed by the people around me, I make changes to fit different people. For instance; my 'friends' at school know me to be a goofy, dumb, quirky sort of person. When really I like to talk, like to listen, I like to be around people like me, like the IB kids. I can relate to them more than another. I just have trouble fitting in there because they have such a tight knit group that has been around each other since middle school and before. I want to be friends with more intellectual people, instead of the popular kids i used to be friends with, or still am. i dont know...im going to bed. Happy New Year.
