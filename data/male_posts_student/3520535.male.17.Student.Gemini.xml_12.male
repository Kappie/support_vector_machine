It's spirit bursting through prison fences, Flooding the street with a sea of sea of ski masks marching from our ditches. A new morning as bright as the smallest spark in the darkest dark. Warm as young lovers in mid kiss, It's wishes whisper between lovers' lips.  When I close my eyes I can see the ghost unearth her life, On never nights like tonight, When daybreak defies midnight. With the backing of the shovels' beat, Burning flags at her feet, crackling over the young lovers' lead, She screams: "Lovers of the world unite, there's no tomorrow...only tonight"  It's time for the new day to break, From the dead dreams we awake. Like a mute speaking, seizing his say, Tomorrow come today
