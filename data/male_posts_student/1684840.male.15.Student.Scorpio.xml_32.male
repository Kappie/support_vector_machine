So we decided to form a group called ADA (Anti-Dinnerlady Association) and our recognition salute is that of Hitler because, naturally, it suits the situation doesn't it?  Anyway, the day went a bit boring after that...  I'd like to formally slag off the weatherman for promising rain storms and thunder, but did we get a drop of rain?  NO!  Instead there was blazing hot sunshine and headaches forcast for me :(  Today has been great though.  I gotta admit though that seeing dinnerladies angry is so much fun muahahahahaha
