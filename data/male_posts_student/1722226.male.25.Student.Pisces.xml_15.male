A collection of stories with substance, with style, where the robots deal with the conflicts of the three laws and where Susan Calvin is the strong, intelligent woman who became one of Asimov's favorite characters.  "I, Robot", the movie sucks ass. Big time.   End of rant.  Not a very impressive rant I agree, but thats all I have the energy for.   Remember, gentle reader, I told you that I would be all alone in the apartment, and that I would enjoy that. Well, I am all alone in the apartment now, and I find that I do not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. Strange is it not?  An apology.  For the misleading title in my previous post. I did mean to compare glasses and contacts. Got a tad diverted and never got around to comparing the two.  And I dont feel like doing it now. So my thoughts on that particular topic will remain an eternal mystery.
