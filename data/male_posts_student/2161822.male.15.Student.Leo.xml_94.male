Anytime we get off school is ok in my book. Except today. Today we had the misfortune of having a "health fair" all day.  Now you'd think hey, it can't be all that bad. Plus we don't have any classes. AND it's a Tuesday which means any other day we'd have to sit through a painstakingly long double period of Chemistry. So I thank God for saving me from that. But it was too good to be true, and indeed the presentations were extremely boring. Talk about clich√©s. Every speech was about crap we've been fed since 4th grade. Drugs, alcohol, sex, everything you're not supposed to do. It's not like we haven't heard this before. But hey, I can't complain since we had no classes. Well I'm glad to see we switch from internet explorer to Mozilla. So much better. So lately I've just been sitting around waiting for the weather to get nice again. Recording covers of songs. I notice the program I have makes me sound alot better than I am. But I won't complain.  Listen to H.I.M.
