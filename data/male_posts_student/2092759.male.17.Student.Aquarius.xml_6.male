Its fun, but at the same time, dealing with thirty middle schoolers ( and a bunch of freshmen and sophomores that need to stop acting like middle schoolers) is not exactly the best job in the world. Im just glad this will help with college, getting a job later in life and it has helped teaching me leadership skills. Now im just a contemptuous asshole as opposed to a contemptuous ashole, who needs to be right all of the time, and be in control, of everything around him.    Mike, our Drum coach has set up a field trip for the Drumline (and its affiliates, Woot for being a low level helper!) to go see the Phantom of The Opera on November 5th. Fifty bucks a pop, and its almost entirely the original broadway cast, so its an amazing opportunity. I love this show, and I hope my parents let me go.     Quick interlude for those who are nerdily inclined:I am currently prepareing for the Extended Season of the Magic The Gathering Pro Tour. Ive been playing the game for around six years and id like to qualify this year. I have developed a deck from an Old Type I deck known as Stax. Its a Tinker Variant that uses red for Goblin Welder to generate an obscene amounto mana and Stroke the opponent to death. If any part of the last paragraph makes a bit of sense, or youd like it to i need all the help i can get testing the format out. It requires a good deal of research and testing so its not to be taken up by people with an overtly full scheduale. End of Nerd Interlude. Ok, heres a random Tolkeinesque poem I wrote.   To The Mountain   The trail is long, the sky is bright and we have long to go. All we need is two fortnight and a lack of snow. My friends have come and gone left me on the trail alone. All I need is starlight and I can bear the storm.
