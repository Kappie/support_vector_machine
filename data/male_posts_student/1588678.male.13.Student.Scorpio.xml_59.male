Oh man, I really wish that Ben Stiller would make more movies like this, not movies where he plays the boyfriend like in "Meet the Parents," "Along Came Polly," and "There's Something About Mary." Well, "There's Something About Mary" was funny, but still, he does a good job in movies like this one.  Okay, first off I gotta tip my hat off for the good job this movie did. They made it look like a real 70s cop TV show, y'know, good guy comes out of nowhere and the camera zooms in fast and having a muscle-type car. You get where I'm going. I mean, just so good. I really gotta tip my hat off for that damn good job.  This movie was VERY funny. It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. For me there were two FUNNIEST scenes. One was with Will Farrell. That's when Will Farrell has to give Starsky and Hutch information about a coke-dealer and he has them do funny stuff before spilling the beans. Like, at one point he has Owen Wilson's character bend over and make a "dragon face." Oh my friggin' god, at one point he has Starsky and Hutch on each other with the dragon look or mad look. Oh god, it was HALLARIOUS! But this part was my favorite; on the job they have what was said to be fake-cocaine. So when they have these two chicks over Ben Stiller's character make coffee and they're out of sugar, so they use the fake-coke. And Ben Stiller starts drinking the coffee only to realize it was REAL cocaine. I mean, I saw it from a mile away, my friend. Then he comes out, high with huge pupils and bloodshot eyes and is like freaking out. Oh my god it was so funny I was laughing so hard I felt like puking! Very funny stuff!  Well, I don’t wanna give it all away, but near the end they lose their Ford Torino and then they get the same one given by the real guys from the original show Starsky and Hutch. Very cool. I mean, this happened because Ben Stiller’s character was so attached to that Ford. So the original Starsky and Hutch give them theirs. Very cool.  This movie was great. It was definitely worth my money. You gotta see this one. If you liked “Old School,” or a movie like that, you’ll LOVE Starsky and Hutch. I can easily give it **** out of ***** stars. Well, enjoy it while it’s still out. I’ll keep ya posted.   By the way, Snopp Dog playing Huggy Bear, he was great! He’s so cool. He did a good job too.
