When I exit from this place; I want to cry, the harshness of the real world pains me so. The people who may seem friendly and beautiful are actually monsters in hiding. They who hurt those who may seem lower than them, though, in actuality, they are all equals. They, who feel that they are superior are nothing but liars and fools, trying to attain some sort of god-like rank among their fellow people. It's painful to see past these fake truths, it hurts so bad... Why can't I just be a superficial fool? At least I won't feel people's pain anymore. Please help me... I don't want to live in the real world anymore where people could hide as beautiful beings, yet in actuality, these majestic beings are truly hideous monsters... In my room, where I lie so sadly, I see a foreboding light from a screen, it draws me near to it, it's hypnotizing power drew me ever closer. I see inside it, people who are not able to judge people superficially but judge them for what they truly are. They act as a family like those you see in movies where there is a powerful bond between them. These groups only judge their people on how they act and how they are, not by their looks... I'm overjoyed to see that I'm able to join this place, which has now become my refuge and my strength, my happiness... THE END
