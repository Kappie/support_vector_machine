Seniors had the best of last week with winning everything they participated in  i think we must have a dope test fron next time onwards.      Also i danced on stage for the first time in my life.And the poem 'NEEND' was praised by many.       Also 'Indra Dev' were at their best during full week with not even a single day sparing with rains  it was really enjoyable to watch n hoot for Football match in rain on I-day.      rain also showed its magic in my home state Rajasthan where till 15 days ago Govt. was planning for Drought Relief and now they have to plan for Flood relief(It happens only in India).      by now the postponed date of QT assigment is again approaching and i think i should leave n prepare for that.
