I like going to the races but i hate all the hastle that we have 2 go through to go to a race. Were leaving for a race in Aynor, South Carolina on Friday. I think that ill b back on Sunday.  Today whiie i was workin on the gotcars on kelly called. i told her that i would call her back and i never got a chance to, but she called again and i wasent there at my phone. I found out that her mom was gonna cum pick me up so i could go 2 her house. Then her mom got mad b/c she was gonna go to kelly's grandma's but didnt b/c she thought that she was gonna pic me up. :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:( i feel miserable.. After we were done with the gotcar we drove to Olive Garden's and got some lunch, and after that we went to the movies to c   King Arthur. It was a pretty good movie. 2 HOURS LONG! i miss my  baby so much. I hope that after they go out to eat the i could go to her house 2 c her. I really messed things up.:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(
