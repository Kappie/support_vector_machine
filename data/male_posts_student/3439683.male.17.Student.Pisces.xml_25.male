We went to Branson on Saturday, visited Nancy on Sunday, came back yesterday, went to Springfield today so that Ross could have his operation. Everything went fine, we're all back here, just finished dinner. Me and my mom are going back to Branson tomorrow, and we're going to do some stuff with David and Esther. Of course, you're probably wondering how my mental state is holding up against this onslaught. Not so good. Less than 24 hours with this crew, and I was desperately wanting to add some good scars to my shoulder. I had gone from good to deep in a dark, depressed hole in a fairly short amount of time. The first night we were in Branson, we went and saw the Presley's Country Jubilee. Good show even though I don't like country music, because the comedians were awesome, and they had some of the younger kids of the family perform. They also had this 16 year old local girl sing (her name was Ambrus Leigh...odd name, don't ya think?), she was downright beautiful, and it's been a while since I heard someone sing that good. And, as you can guess, that didn't help my depression any. Found myself envying her talent. Got her autograph after the show, told her how awesomely talented she was, didn't tell her though that my complements are few and far between when it comes to music since I've heard some of the best singers in the world. My impression of her though is that it hasn't gone to her head, she seemed pretty genuine and humble. You know, the funny thing is, what I said to her are the only words I've spoken to someone that's even remotely close to my age. Seriously, I've had no social life here, no one to talk to besides the older folks. Makes me feel so terribly alone. I have no outlet for my depression save through music and writing, which I have been doing in earnest, but it's not enough. ooh, look, mom's back from Dairy Queen. Pardon me while I go stuff my face.
