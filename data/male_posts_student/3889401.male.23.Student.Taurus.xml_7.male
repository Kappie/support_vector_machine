Insatible hunger for evrythign beautiful and meaningful; undying romanticism in those motivates him to the zenith of what he does. He defines his own rule, and breaks them when he wants. HE has his own world and yet that own world of himself always intersects with the common three dimensional space in which we live. He is his own fountain head and he is his own companion and competitor. This guy is intriguingly simple and yet, will compel you to have a closer look at him. You can hate him or love him, but definitely can't ignore him.
