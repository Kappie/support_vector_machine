Friends is all i got now and maybe hook up every now and then. I have to see. Today im going to the city to give him back his Nextel i530. It seems his brother needs it back because they billed up one hell fo an amount.(approx. $600)I didn't want to go alone, but I felt i had no choice. I was afraid that I would do something retarded or just go crazy. At 10:30 during my cisco class, his brother calls to see when i can meet him to get the nextel back. I didn't want to leave school early, so I just waited until after school. i told him i get out of school around 2:40 so if i take the 3:00 boat, ill be there at 3:30. I decided that since I didn't want to be alone, I would ask people to go with me. I asked, ofcourse Jasmin first. She said she needed to get home by 4:15 so she had to think about it. Howard said he'll go if i get a third person to go with me. Jeff didn't want to go. I ended up telling Howard that i will do him 1 favor if he comes with me. Now im stuck burning him every CD i own. He also got Edwin to come with us. Jasmin couldn't come cause she had.....problems.  I got on the 3:00 boat and it was us three. I was bracing myself for what would happen today. It also just occured to me that Howard and Edwin will be seeing who I've been leaving to see so much and what is the cause of my stress. At 3:30, I  saw him and he wanted to know why I was walking so damn slow from the boat. I didn't answer him. I gave him back his nextel and a always get him a bag of M peanuts. Its just something im use to doing. I asked him what he was doing that day. I ended up telling Howard and Edwin to go home without me and i just stayed there with him. We talked about what's going on and issues we got going. I told him that for now i hope we find our way back or have a chance to start. For now i'll be burning until he returns. He's a good person. I'm willing to wait. But for now i have his friendship and some benefits and that will do for now.     When you're all alone, and you need a friend, someone to help you to the end, when you need someone to catch you when you fall, I'll be there through it all.     And just when you thought you were falling, but you know I'll always be right there. oh-oooh whenever you need me, I'll always be right there.
