Then Paul left so we took over the blue sticker on his phone which he goes crazy not to take it off. Why, who the fuck knows. So we jammed and all, didn't do much. Then later on I went to Kaiser's, did some diddly, ate some pizza, saw Gavin kick Tom video, amazing. Especially the expression on Dan's face. Gavin you could crush Agent Smith, go for it. Ok, so nothing really amazing, just average fun for today. Now Tringali's coming over 11:40 at night so cya guys later.
