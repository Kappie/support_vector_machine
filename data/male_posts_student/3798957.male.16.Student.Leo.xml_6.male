Yup, downloading anime, watching box sets with my friends, smattering my speech with the few words I know because it makes me feel so special. It's just so  kawaii ! My brother always likes to go eat ribs at Tony Roma's, but they taste less wonderful. He doesn't like sushi. He always looks for something like french fries or grilled cheese sandwiches when we go to Japanese resturaunts, and makes  me  feel embarrased. My friend with a credit card ordered me a t-shirt that says "Jesus saves!" and below that, "but the rest of you take damage." I guess Jesus has evasion. Probably took a few levels of expert(carpentry, of course.) until he could qualify for survivor. Cause, you know, I'm pretty sure Jesus didn't have any rogue levels. Oh, and you should all read Penny Arcade, Sam and Fuzzy, Machall, and Vgcats. Cheese fuckin' sammiches! Come on!
