It was so perfect before, or atleast we thought, but we could have it even more perfect now. There's so much that I just can't let go of even though I'v tried. It's hard to explain and I guess you'll never really understand unless you can really look deep down inside your heart and try to remember what we used to have. I felt something with you, something I've never felt before and as hard as I may try it just wont go away. Lying there in your arms for hours on end doing nothing, it was special, it meant the most. I miss that, I miss you, and I'll always be here. I believe everyone deserves a second chance, just maybe I could have mine?
