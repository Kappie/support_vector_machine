I really don't expect anyone else to read this, but everyone is welcome into my world. The reason I decided to name this page Baka Gaijin (Stupid Foreigner) is that I will be starting college in Ohio next month, and I feel like I will be a stupid foreigner there. I have grown up in Alabama my entire life, but there were no colleges around here that had what I wanted. You see my dream in to live in a peaceful town in Japan with a career that I enjoy and that helps people. I found a college that let's you major in East Asian Studies, and I decided that I wanted to go there. It is a private university though, but somehow I was accepted. I will be able to learn Japanese there, and I can study in Japan my third year. It seems like the best place to begin my quest to achieve my dreams. I just hope that I am smart enough to make it through. My family and friends think so, but I have been having doubts. I also wonder if I will be able to make it in Japan. Not to be stereotyping are anything but the Japanese are in my opinion the most intelligent group of people on the planet. How can I fit in? Well that is a bit lengthy explanation on the Baka Gaijin. I will be posting my thoughts and experiences in a "foreign" land. Take care everyone.
