Next thing, I was doing some programming with the staff's select thing on the  urlLink Gamer's Forum  that I'm in charge of.  I got a nice start to the day, then I looked at the clock. 2:45. I was lucky to make it to work on time.  I threw my clothes on and luckily, my dad was there to take me to work.  Isn't it weird how I work at McDonalds and never get fatter? It must be my exercise program that I call the "Relentless Program". However, its practices are exactly opposite its name. Below is a list of what to do.   The Relentless Exercise Program Sit and program on the computer for as long as you can  Bring up food if you're hungry. Preferably cereal and/or milk.  If you get bored of programming, sit and watch TV for a couple hours  Once you feel nostalgic because you left your computer, go program again.  Go to bed when you feel like it.  Wake up when you feel like it.  Stay inside as much as possible.   Not much of an exercise program now, is it? I'm still working on the details, but that's really what I'm doing here. I'm still  underweight   Anyway, back to my day.  I was working in the first window. Not the most exciting post for my shift. I got my paycheck. I opened it.  $100.03  But there were $10 taken off for tax. It should have been $110.03. I looked again and there was a new tax listed on there. Maybe it was a tax only for >100.00. Maybe it was a new federal tax. Whatever it was, it was sapping my wallet dry and I hated it.  I talked to my Girlfriend tonight. I forgot to tell her I got my paycheck today, but oh well. I can do that tomorrow. We talked more about each other's lives.  We're finally staring to communicate a lot more. I am happy about that.
