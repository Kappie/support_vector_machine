We couldn't contain ourseleves and had to keep ourselves occupied on the long journey to cardiff by eating unhealthy amounts of sweets and waving to people we didn't know. We finally got there at about 5:20pm. We'd had to walk when the 'park + ride' bus dropped us off halfway to the stadium. We walked around the stadium to gate one and went in. Chicks on Speed were about 1/3 of the way through their set, and thank god we hadn't gotten in earlier, they were terrible. They were wierd techno-space furturistic crap, and they probably were on speed. Tonnes of plastic bottles were redirected from the bins to the 'Chicks' faces, and at the end, they said we were the best audience they'd had!!!  Half an hour later James Brown and his band came onstage and were surprisingly good. He performed a few of his classics and some funky stuff that everybody got down to (especially a bald guy who had a metre long spliff). Then everything went quiet. James Brown and his band went offstage and the guys started setting up the stage for the Red Hot Chili Peppers' set. They had a walkway round the back of Chad's drumkit and four massive screens on either side of the stage.   Then everything went black, the lights went out and suddenly Flea (bass), John (guitar) and Chad (drums) were on the stage! An amazing sound shook the stadium, it was undescribable. I knew this was going to be good. A new clean-cut John sliced through the monstrous bass sound of Flea with the simplistic but skillful sound of his guitar. Chad Smith was playing better than I'd ever heard before and everyone loved it. After the opening song, Anthony (vocals) came onstage from the left in three quarter lenghts and a school blazer. He had grown his hair to about shoulder length.  They started the set with 'Can't Stop' and played a number of songs from 'Calafornication', simplistic stuff like 'Emit Remmus' and 'I Like Dirt' and of coarse the classics, 'Under the Bridge' and 'Calafornication' iself were also played. There were a number of solos and jamming sessions involved which included a new song which they had written recently. To end the set, they played 'Give it Away' the song in which they trashed the drumkit and started getting a bit crazy: Flea wearing one of Chad's symbols on his head while playing bass and Anthony barely balancing on the loose Bass-Drum whilst singing.(He fell off a couple of times).   We left with a buzzing in our ears and an experience that both of us will never forget. Thankyou Red Hot Chili Peppers!!
