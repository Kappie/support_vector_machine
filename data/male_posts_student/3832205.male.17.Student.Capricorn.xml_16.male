Yes for you guys there are a lot of girls there, but when you really like some one back home it sucks. They kept reminding me of her. Oh they are also annoying and like to ask for numbers and give you a lot of smiles. No one got my number Laura, nonono :). Allthough there were 3 girls who joined me in the hot tub, they werent annoying and we just talked about the hotel. Ha it was hilarious, they were joining me in complaining about the hotel. Then I ditched them, haha.       All I wanted to do was come home, see Laura, and give her the gifts I got :). And well that time has arrived, and now im happy. :)
