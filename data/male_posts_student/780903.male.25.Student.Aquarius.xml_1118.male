I've accomplished one and a half of them so far.  One of the items on my list is to come up with some headlines/stories to contribute to the April Fools edition of the law school newspaper, which will be a week late because of Spring Break.  Feel free to e-mail any headline ideas, if you don't mind my stealing them and turning them into articles.  "Lawyer comes to campus, talks about law" is my first inspiration.
