This is a mockery made out of me! I feel so disgraced! How am I gonna face my tuition teacher, you tell me? Sigh.  One good thing though. I passed my English. Confirmed le, by Mrs Thong! Good good. She scared me today by saying "Only 1 person in Band 1 failed". I thought I am doomed. Not really. I dunnoe lor. I feel I wouldn't fail, because my English ain't weak. But I got scared la. Siva said I should pass, because I am not lousy. I am hoping I would improve to a B. Mrs Thong said everyone improved...so I wished I would get a B4. B3 is the most ideal of coursze. And yes, Siva got the top, again! Whoo-hoo! Way to go girl!  Then, after school, CQ and I stayed back to wait for Gloria. Ayiah, in the end, she went to the library. Sigh. Me, CQ and WQ walked back home. Yes yes CQ. I am gonna talk about it now, okay? Happy? I felt happy la. Well, we are talking and chit-chatting away happily. Hmm. CQ (you!) told me just now that I must cherish this friendship. Well, I definitely will! Don't worry. I won't get heated up again. I will try to control my temper.....(ren yi shi feng ping lang qing, tui yi pu hai lang tian kong) I feel too happy even to quarrel with him anyway. So, thanks CQ! For sticking by my side these days.  After I came back, I bathed and then watched the District. Child-abuse case is being shown. Oh my!! Horrible horrible parents. After watching District, I played FFIX. Okay, FFIX update. I found out where Quan's Dwelling is. I got most of the cracks and bubbles treasure (except for the on in Disc 4) and tried to complete the Stellazizzo colelction. Well, only left certain things (which I can only get if I advance the story).   Today's Holland V is rather sad. XiaoHui got killed (I screamed out loud!!) by the idiot and YanYan was caught, but was not repentant. And most horrifying of all, RouRou got raped by damned despicable TianCheng. Oh!! I hate him! He should be better off locked up in a mental hospital indefinitely.   I am now very angry. Very very agnry. At my damn modem. Stupid leh! Now, it refusesd to connect to the internet. But this can be solved by rebooting the computer. AND THAT'S A WASTE OF MY TIME! Do you know how many minutes is wasted? 2 FREAKING MINUTES! Everytime I try to go online! 2 MINUTES OF MY LIFE IS WASTED! This used to be a rare moment thingy, but it became a daily affair.   I am so darn pissed. Okay. I ending here liao. See ya later. Night blog!
