Why am I so sad as to waste a precious summer day of holiday waiting for a simple message one might ask? My phone works if I go out, or go training, but for some reason I can't bring myself to leave the house, in case when the reply comes I'm unable of reading it out of the house?  I know this is ridiculous but it's true. I can't help it, sometimes a thought or idea gets into my ugly little head, and takes complete control. I spend hours sitting around the house saying I have to go out and do something, only to find myself waiting by the phone for the next 6 hours. and of course it can all be put down to girls. Well a girl. Pah, I'm pathetic!!!!  On a lighter note, today I have had a chance to play some bass geee-tar, and have learned some cool RHCP songs like californication.  woohooo go Ed!!!!
