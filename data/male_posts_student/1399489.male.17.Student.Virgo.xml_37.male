I forgot my physics binder and i have a physics test tom so that really sucks! then we had meet the bruins.  there was free food!! haha i had 3 sandwitches and a hotdog.  Then i came home and did some religion homework and kinda studied for a bit.  Then i called folks well jessica and thats when it kinda got stressful but it worked out or i think it did.  i think tomorrow will be a good day.  we have out football scrimage and then were (me and bryndan) are goin to the mc game and i get to see jessica dance!!! she been tellin me about it alot so i cant wait.  after that i think i have to come home though b/c my sister is commin into town and i "have to spend time with her b/c i never get to see her" so my parents say.  but thats what up in my life right now so im goin to bed i really need some good sleep.  hope everybody is doin good.  *peace out to all my homies* :P
