I went fenceing on Wednesday, can't wait to go again, save one thing they're are campers there! There are two of them who just happen to take the junior class, the class which is before mine, argah! Luckily this is there first time fenceing so they are not in my class.... *few*.              This week I did one of my annual ufology searches. I turned up a few good hits, but I am starting to think that I have found most of the good ones. Here are some of my finds so far: http://ufos.about.com/ http://www.ufology.org.uk/   (to bad its perely british and the despise anyone else....) http://www.scifi.com/ufo/     (a surprisingly good site) http://www.x-ppac.org/main.htm     (they scare me at times, very secret society like, even though they are against them...?)  http://www.cufos.org/ http://ufoinfo.com/roundup/  (page looks dumb, is one of the best, to bad it looks dumb) http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/    (not souly by any means Ufology, but an okay page)                  And just cause I have started nameing links, here are a few others which I enjoy, and/or participate in: http://www.adiumx.com/ http://www.scifi.com/ http://www.nationstates.net/ http://www.nationstates.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi/target=display_nation/nation=the_vi_melon     (my country, or actually Nation-state in the above)  http://sasroleplay.proboards33.com/   (this is one that I participate in, and do NOT enjoy yet, cause well, nothing has happened, at all, but meh, I feel obligated I am friends with one of the admins and I mean there are only like four people there right now.) http://www.wicca.com/celtic/cc002.htm  http://wicca.com/celtic/forums/     ( a great, no the best, forum out there!)          Today my pop and I ran thousands upon thousands of errands, like we do EVERY sunday, One of the places we stopped was the Harly Davidson store, to get his brother, my uncle, a girft for his birthday. Well I am getting the feeling that my father wants to join my uncle in Hoggness, and get a bike....... Eeew. That would crush me, well not really but it would mean I could not go auto-crossing with my dad, and thats fun. So, yeah, as other people wine about how horible their lives are on there boards, I am winning about how conflicting my good life is.....  geee, I better stop before I hurt my self, eew.
