It's excuse for existence is that it covered computer games, but it was so much more, John!  It was littered with funnies every day and was literally the first thing I looked at when I woke up. Of course, I only discovered it in it's later years, seeing as I didn't watch Teletext much at the age of 5. Alas, Digi is now gone, but it's legacy lives on!
