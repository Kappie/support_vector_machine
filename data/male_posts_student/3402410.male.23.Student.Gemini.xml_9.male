I did watch her on TV though (so, I did get to see her play, just not in person). Actually, I did see her in person on the practice courts. She was looking very pretty.  Of course, she's also just as funny looking as ever.      I'm pretty funny looking too though. Clearly we belong together.       Tidbit: three of the four semifinalists at this year's tournament are Russian. FYI: This is due to the fact that Boris Yeltsin is a tennis nut, and when he was in power he put lots of money into developing young talent. Another tidbit: 6 of the top-ranked 15 women tennis players are Russian, while only 3 are American. (The Cold War still rages on inside my head, evidently. Go Sputnik!)
