We cannot let our team ever fall apart. Team-Mates are throwing insults at each other. Maybe its the scrimage that causes the disputes, but we do really need training on real games. So what is the solution to our never ending quarellings, but at the same time train up our 'real game skills'? Perhaps the most significant dispute was the packing of equipments. The captain have to arrange and organise it. Its not gonna be me! Nor anybody else! Aaron claims that the sec2 gang (tim, gary, or_jiao, jia yuan) are responsible for it. It may be true that they come earlier than us to have breakfast at MacDonals and arrive at the field for early Game that they play on their own. To do that, they would have to take out the equiments. That's already half the job done.but in the afternoon we take turns to keep.  So, i would suggest that they would be the one to take out the equipments and the rest to keep the equipments in the afternoon during trainings on saturday.
