I was at the parksville carshow and for stating the obvious i got over 50$ worth of stuff! so for all of those people that complain about my stating of obvious things HA and Phoey! the details of the story are as follows: there was a person who won an award for the best tractor there and the announcer asked what makes you think this guy is a tractor driver when you first see him? i looked at the guy looked almost boring nothing special green cap, white shirt jeans nothing fancy.... and i yelled at the guy " it's the hat!" and he said, "what about the hat" and I was the only person who said It has a tractor logo on it!(john deere tractors ltd.) it was so stupidly obvious and now i have some professional grade chains for my bike, new grips, extra strong torque tube for my tire and the knowledge that stupidly obvious things aren't!
