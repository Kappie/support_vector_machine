I went out for dinner with my future in-laws, it was interesting. See, they don't speak any english, and I don't speak Cantonese yet. Auntie was wearing an Ayumi Hamasaki shirt, I wonder if she knows who it is? I wonder if she even likes her? I know she doesn't speak any japanese... it would make things a little easier for me if she did. I'm finding it a little hard to get used to the eating ritual of grabbing the food you want from a center plate - WITH YOUR DIRTY CHOPSTICKS. They seem to be clean freaks except for that, they wash all the dishes with the tea before they eat off them. Yes, at the table in the restraunt, they clean the dishes. I know I've lost weight, I fit my pants now that were too small for me.. It's got to be all the fish and pocky. Yes. When I return to canada I start a strict diet of fish and Pocky. That is all for today, I'm being hailed on MSN..
