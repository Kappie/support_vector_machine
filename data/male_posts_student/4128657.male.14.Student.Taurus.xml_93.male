Treat them RESPECTFULLY--they could be the most valuable thing that ever came into your life. Treat them PROTECTIVELY--don't let them get away. Treat them NUTRITIONALLY--feed them and feed them well. Treat them ANTISEPTICALLY--don't let them get infected with the germs of negative thoughts. Treat them RESPONSIBLY--Respond! Act! Do something with them! Decide to decide!  - Anonymous
