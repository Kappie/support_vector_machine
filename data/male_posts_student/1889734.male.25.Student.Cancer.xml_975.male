Three campaign finance watchdog groups filed a complaint Tuesday accusing a group of Vietnam veterans of violating the campaign finance law by airing an ad that challenges Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry's military record.   Democracy 21, the Center for Responsive Politics and the Campaign Legal Center argue that the ad by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth violates a federal ban on the use of unlimited donations, often referred to as "soft money," to influence federal elections.   Uh, what about MoveOn.org ads?  What about Planned Parenthood ads?  Campaign Finance Reform is and was a completely laughable piece of legislation, and shame on all parties (including Bush) for pushing it through.  It's absurd to restrict speech in a political season, just unbelievably absurd.
