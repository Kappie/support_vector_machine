Thats me and the other 6  billion people in this world. This "blog" is set here to record the thoughts of this seemingly inconsiquential, ill-evolved, person. I doubt that it will be terribly interesting, and i doubt my commitment to this site, but i do think that it could be helpful to get some insight into the trials and tribulations of one lonesome soul named Oliver Hulland.
