The first track is cool, but I think that's all I'm going to get to listen to 'fore I piss off to the Les Mis dress.  Oh, and this is particular to Scott - you know you were talking about changing a note in a piece and making someone cry? Well, the case picture behind the CD (ie. the bit that holds it) has the words "...I can change one note and make you cry..." on it. Weird, no?  Love, Jon Roskilly
