But seem to me that his speed drop but his stamina has greatly increase, i think that at china they train on lap swimming to built up stamina so sprinting wasn't that much.  Lol...after that went to play bowling and the good thing is that one of the swimmers father paid for us...said that it's his treat. Was Wondering why did he treat us? I mean like we wasn't very familiar with him, well all that comes well goes well hehe. After the competition i and my fren went to yishun shoping mall to walk and sat at starbucks to chat. Took the MRT back home at Bishan hehe my new home...i've always wanted to live at Bishan, the place there is peaceful and all my swim frens stay there...ahhhhh so great to live at a place where you can meet your frens anytime you wan.  In the evening, I was invited to a buffet dinner at parkmall with my cousins...wow the dinner was great, there were so many variety of foods and thinking of it makes me want to go back there hiaz.  Was eating like mad, had many rounds of food...lolx must be thinking that i like never ate in ages...well when if comes to buffet you must make use of the money that you spend on the food or else the money that you pay so much will be wasted, so the point of having a buffet is to eat more than what you pay hehe.  I was so full when i got back home, never ate so full before for a long time hahax...went to fren house to play com which was juz two to three blocks away...lolx thats why i said staying at a area when all your frens are staying is juz so great.
