The most intersting thing about the games previews is that JOHN CARMAK (the creator of the game) .. got scared himself playing it. Therefor your bound to get the creeps out of this one people, and if you dont then mebbe youre too old to be playing it and you have seen it all, or mebbe your gf/ bf is just as beautiful .. :P :D ... Any ways so much for that.   They just announce there Benchmarks .. and the people who played the game were stunned to see that it worked extraordinarily well, even on a G force 4 Mx 440 with 1.5 GHz Intel System!  Now thats golden for me baby, with a few bux my snail of a pc will be able to work it, like a horse in a race .. (inshALLAH) I hope so. And that is if the A levels dont chop my brains for total studay and no funneee... :(  Anyways Ma3salaam for now ..   LuDa ..   and yeah Doom 3's gone gold BABAY!
