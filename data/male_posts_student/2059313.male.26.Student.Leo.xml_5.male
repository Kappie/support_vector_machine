I was in the youth choir at my church.  I played Alto Sax, Trumpet, and a variety of drums through the course of my High School career.  Over the past year or two, I've toyed around with playing the guitar.  I started out by taking two lessons while borrowing a friend's accoustic.  At first, I lacked the finger strength or dexterity to properly apply pressure on the strings to hit the fretboard... I became very frustrated, very quickly and I quit.  I had taken with me the knowledge of the most popularly used chords in Music... G, C, and D.  Later I picked up a friend's electric guitar that he had laying around.  I found it much easier to press down on the strings.  And the spacing of the frets and strings was much easier than an accoustic.  It renewed my interest.  After about a month playing on his electric, I bought an amp (since he didn't have one) and heard all this other GREAT stuff.  The amp had an overdrive switch on it, and I thought it was just the coolest thing... I could get a clean sound, or a variety of rock-like guitar sounds.  Shorty after I bought the amp.  I bought my first guitar.  A Fender: Squire... modeled after the Strat.  By far one of the best investments I have made.  It is such a great expression of one's self.  If I've had a bad day, I can come home and purge my soul for a few minutes by playing a few sad chords... "I guess that's why they call it the blues". Heh.  After a while, I got a little bored knowing just four or five chords... so I bought books, watched tapes, looked up sites on the internet to try to further and expand my knowledge base.  Then I learned Barre Chords... the staple of Rock and Roll... with these chords, you can take any chord and move it up and down the frets to make MORE CHORDS!    Okay, so that's where I was at as of two days ago.  So yesterday, I went in to my local guitar shop and purchased an effects pedal.  Actually, not just a single FX pedal, but one with a LOT of FX built in.  I plugged this mystical box in, and it was like the holy grail was set before me.  So many options to choose from, and it has built in drum rythms to play along to.  Now I can make sounds with my guitar that I can match my moods to, or songs to... and it's great!  I think I'll go play, now, while my roommates are out of the apartment.
