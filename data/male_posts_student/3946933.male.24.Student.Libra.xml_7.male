To put it in a better prespective: First of all, it's August. August, in Portugal, means +30ÂºC temperatures, sun, beach, friends and beer. Today's weather was like a good day in London, cloudy, humid and boring. Next, I'm still having smoking problems. It's not the nicotine addiction, it's more the psychological addiction. And, if you smoke / have smoked, you know how good it feels when you're bored. And, to finish this, I had a huge craving for spending money in a that techno-geek style.  Bottom line, boredom.  I ended up in FNAC, browsing games, cellphones, small-as-in-fit-it-into-a-purse-style computers, dvd's... the usual. I ended up picking a 100m capable USB BlueTooth adapter, to explore a moblog idea I'm having. Setting up the BT was painless and I had no problem hooking it up in FMA. After backing up my cellphone, I started browsing the scripts section of the program,to find out  urlLink CarpediWebMouse.  Basically, it enables the Acessories menu in the T630 Connections menu. From there you can control programs like iTunes, Winamp, PowerDVD even Powerpoint. Simply amazing.  The capabilities for this kind of thing are almost endless. Hook it up to X10 and control your whole house from the cell... wow.
