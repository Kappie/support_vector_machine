They were the defending champions, 1 year ago, they made an unbeatable run to win the Trophy. This year, they fell. They took the lead in the 1st inning, with 2 homeruns, they lead 2-1. That was not the end. We batted well, especially when Jia Yuan hit a homerun, bringing 1 in. All these were followed by a homerun, hit by an unbelievable samuel. He hit the ball into left field, where they all underestimated his size, came forward.  But perhaps, the most exciting part was the last inning. You may have thought that majority of the runs came in here. But you are WrOnG. We batted 1st, no advantage, more disadvantage. We batted our last inning, but to no avail, no runs. When it was their turn to bat, things were getting more tense. Their star batter came out, with a runner on 1st. I knew i had to give him a walk, or a homerun means GaMe oVeR. Nevertheless, i gave him an intentional walk. The Next batter was also powerful, but also got a walk. Then, it was all bases loaded. A short batter came out, perhaps a walker? It was 2 out. Strike-Out means we win. But it would seem ridiculous. Give him a free walk? NO WAY. So, all i did was to control my ball for him. I had 2 strikes on him. So when i pitched my final ball, I admired it moving towards the target, thinking of him getting strike-out, but he swang. The Ball went high. Every runner left their bases heading for the next. The most important was the runner from 3. Just at the corner of my eye, seeing him struggling to home, which means they were about to score another tie-breaking point. Fortunately, the ball went high to me, and i caught it. 3rd base was rushing for me. 1st base also wanted the ball. But i kept my cool, to insert it into the deep pocket, back in my glove, saved, we had just won Raffles institution
