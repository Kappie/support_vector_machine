I was dissapointed to watch the Toronto loss, but my angst washed away in the cleansing Calgary OT win over the nameless barbarians from Michigan.  I love seeing Cujo looking befuddled.  But I know it's a long road, and I wouldn't dream of extrapolating an outcome based on one game.  For either series.  But there is a lot at stake here for everyone involved.  We all know that our personal value as human beings is solely dependent on how far our team advances in the finals.
