    
       I am (about to be) a freshman at North. I'll post my classes when I get my schedule, which should arrive any day now. Right now I can't wait for school to start (yeah, I know, it sounds awfully nerdish, but education has the potentiAL to be fun, and more intensive social interaction ALmost never fails to delight). I may regret my words in a month or two, but optimism never hurt anyone, with the possible exception of Candide (character in a Voltaire book, easy to read, but the action moves too fast to get a good stable novel). Until then, I'm savoring AL of the benefits of my lethargy, which I certainly will miss once school rolls around.  I'm Jewish (and proud of it), and am now considered a man under Jewish law having ALready undergone my Bar Mitzvah. So why can't I see R-rated movies without an adult, drive, vote, or have a job without a work permit? Blatant ageism, that's why. (This is actuALly only part of my politicAL views on the subject, I'll explain more later.) I encourage everyone to embrace their Jewish heritage, even if they're not even remotely Semitic.   Le Chaim (to life)!
