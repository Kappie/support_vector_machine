I dont know...but I think I am going to end up being just like my sister with her stupid window...Her's wouldn't go up...and she didnt want to buy a new motor, so she cardboarded and packaging taped it up :) Very very  urlLink red-neckish . quite amusing though :)  I dont know what to do though. My dad doesn't really seem to care...ever. My mom is doing nothing but softball with Anne. I hate that. When its softball season nobody pays attention to me. Maybe thats good. I like to be left alone...just because I cooperate with myself :)  I might have to take it in to fix it myself...
