Excited...not really. Ready to get it over with...hell yes...Well all i had to take was my spanish final, i thought to myself "shoot, i did pretty damn good last time when i didnt study, well i think its gonna b like that again."...i was wrong...DEAD wrong...the first part of the test was conjugation...lame to the max, i didnt know any of it...then the 2nd part of the test was multiple choice...i think i did alright, but yeah...i hate spanish to the max...then me and b headed off to anahiem to c if we still have a chance to play in a match. So when we got there, it was the last match of the day...we ended up losing and we ended up getting 4th in our poolits a bad thing...then me, b, nick, and john went off to motel 6 and got us a hotel...we got 2 roomz and there r 4 ppl in each room, supposebly. Then me, andy, and brian went to the mall cuz i forgot a headband at home and i needed one cuz my hair getz all crazy when i play in gamez...then we watched "Dodgeball", which i must say was a hilarious move...kicked ass...then we headed back and went to bizzed.    Saturday  Well, we started off the day bright and early...about 6:15ish...what a way to start off the summer huh kid!?!....haha. Well we were in an ok pool i guess...not really, haha. Well our first game was against smbc 18s silver...they werent that strong, so we beat them easily in 2...then we played virginia coastal...we lost in that game, jus the mistakez we make during the games this tourney is what killed us...then we played amazon 18-1s...we beat them in 3 games...then after the tourney me, andy, john, matt, and brian went to hooterz and grubbed. Then we went to a different mall and hung out there for a bit...i went B.A.K. at pac-sun...haha. Then we headed back to the tourney cuz we had to play a challenge bracket against club wood...we lost in 2, which sucked. Then we headed back to the hotel and i talked to stephanie, which was big relief cuz i missed her and i needed someone else to talk to besides the team, its good hearin her sweet voice aswell. =)...and that was my saturday.   Sunday  Well this was our last chance for pool play. Well the 1st match we had to play was jus a scrimmage cuz the other team forfieted cuz they didnt have enuff playerz to play. The 2nd match we beat SCVC, we kicked there buttz pretty badly...then we played mustangz and we beat them in 2...so we got first, so that was a relief, dan was pretty kick back today...maybe cuz hez fed up wit our crap i guess. Brian today had troubles setting the middles, so i couldnt really do anything wit the setz...i got frustrated about that. Then after wordz we went back to our hotel...good stuff back at the hotel...brianz ball across the street...mangina...HAHAHAHAHA!...then we went to downtown disney for a bit and headed to the mall, but it was closed, so we ate a cpk...i told the guyz some jokez...and about the angry dragon...hahahahaha, good stuff good stuff. And we went back to the hotel and chilled.   TODAY  Well today we had playoffs and it was a single match elimination. Our first, and final, match was against yucaipa, or somethin like that. The 1st game was wack, brian did a good job setting, i jus sucked ass and hitted it into the block a shit load of timez, so we lost. The 2nd game, we won, i did a good job serving and hitting. The 3rd game we lost...yeah...after the match, some of the guyz went to in-and-out...spencer freakin tried to order a cup of water via drive thru...haha, it was sooo funny. Then me, brain, and andy went to santa monica and walked around on 3rd street. I went B.A.K. at urban outfitterz...i like these glasses, hahaha. Then now im here...tired, thinkin bout steph, thinkin bout j.o.s, and thinkin about my kick ass summer...payce outside!
