I often wonder, whether other people have see deep into Life as it is. Not just what we have around us, but the depths, where misery and poverty reign. Have you ever met an orphan? Or someone from a broken family? These days, we know more and more people who have had divorces and that's becoming common. However, to me... What I treasure most is a deep insight into the deepest, darkest of a human soul.. It's meaningful I guess and impacting too. I guess that's why some people are counselors and psychiatrist. The reason is because, when you fix a human, his life, like a machine, you have to take him apart, check everything over and repair or replace or introduce new parts. That's when you really gain an insight into life.    Haha, Shulingsays that I like extreme stuff... I dunno about that but i'd love to do paintballing and rockclimbing ifI could. I don't really fancy musical stuff, but Ilike outdoor activities. Not sport, outdoor. You get to work hard but you don't need to compete, lolz.. I mean, all sports are competitive after all. Gymnast, Soccer, Rugby, I can't think of any whichdoesn't have the main objective of scoring more points than the other.Figure skating, even swimming!!Although often, outdoor activities and sport cross into each other, I still like outdoor activities. Lolz, or do I? Hmmm, not sure but i'd like my belief to be challenged. Speaking of which, I read an interesting 1939 book in the V.Hivefurniture store my mother went to today. It was one of those silly gibberish booksyou find in the bookshelves.. Thisone talked about God though.. very scary!!! Even as I read it, I felt my beliefs being changed and shaped...The author was talking about Genesis, the creation of life, the creation of God. It was very scaryasI realised I was being changed as I read one word after the other... He said thatin the beginning, there was light and darkness. Within the light was thought and will andafter eons, thought andwill  grew closer and light grew brighter. Slowly, as they finally became united,light spread out everywhere andcovered darkness. And they said thought-will was God. And that God created 12 beings. Then, one day he decided to make other beings and so he made the planets. Then, he chose one, Earthor rather, he knew Earth would be able to supportlife. So he sent those 12 beings there. They helped get ready the Earth and waited and waited.. then they grew impatient and asked why God was tarrying. Then. God said.. Those who have been impatient, come back because I do not want you to lead the new people. But they refused and tried to figure out life. God sent another warning. They did not listen, finally,when God saidsomething about Darkness being limited, they decided to create life out of notLight, but Darkness. And so this Darkness came out and corrupted them and changed the entire planet.  Haiyo, you read already... Do youfeel like something's changing? I dunno, but as I read all this over again, I feel it sinking in. Haiyo, no no no!! Must get it out!! Scary stuff manand it's just so addictive..make me want to read more but must resist. Thankfully my mum came by then. Hahaz, speaking of resisting, I managed to resist temptation today! Yea~!! Hahax, but cannotcelebrate too soon because I know i'm still vulnerable.. Gtg back to my Chem Webquest now, wish me luck~!!
