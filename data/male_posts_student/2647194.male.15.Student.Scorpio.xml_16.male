He's a conservative and he told a really bad joke. We only played for about 15 minutes total, whereas the whole event was multiple hours.  Recap: 9:00- Waiting in the Great Hall at MSA for the buses that were supposed to be there at 8:00. Basically standing around, messing with the piano and such. 9:50- Somewhere around that time slot, the buses finally arrived. Two nice and street-dirty yellow school buses. Without a trailer for all the stuff. "Stuff" includes, the drumset, plenty of alternative percussion, mallets, 2 portable keyboards, a large bass amp, two guitar amps, music stands, hand drum stands, and countless string intruments including a guitar and a cumbersome cello. What a joy that was loading and unloading-4 times. 10:30 to 1:22 (real specific...lol)- Milled around, ate my lunch that I had already eaten on the bus, set up, and sound checked. 1:22 and beyond- Played Imagine, and listened to the other choirs and stuff.  *Why?* Three MSA choir members, whose names will not be mentioned, sat out on singing "O Colored Earth", because it contained the ideal that all animals are equal, peace and love and whatnot. The should still have to sing. If a Jewish person was in a choir, or a Hindu or Buddhist or whatever for that matter, and had to sing Christian songs, they don't have to believe it. However, they should still have to sing it. Otherwise, this will lead to people saying, "Oh, I don't believe in this line here-I won't sing it". Just sing the damned song and don't make a fuss of it. Geez.  Recently, there's been some questioning about Bush bringing back the Draft. However, he wouldn't do it until he's elected this time around. That poses some serious questions about everyone our age. In two years, enlist? register? resist? or move to Canada? So many people would be in an uproar about this...  Our current military status is that most of our troops are either in Iraq, coming back from Iraq in a coffin, or going to Iraq. When will this end? The only reason the Draft would be reinstated is Bush being a war monger, and needing more troops. If the draft came back, our country would be divided much moreso than even between the radical leftists and neo-conservatives. Well, I guess you could always move to Europe too. Yeah, I'd rather go to Europe than Canada-too close to Bush...I'm sick of it all!  On another quite positive note, this f@#$ing storm that we're supposed to get tonight is going to dump pissy rain on us instead of snow. That'll ruin even the downhill skiing base at Afton, Welch Village, or Wild Mountain, let alone the cross-country trails all over the metro. I really need to go somewhere where there's a real winter and I can actually enjoy it...Switzerland, France-somewhere near the Alps. This pair of cross-country skis I bought are going absolutely nowhere. Damn the whether. Damn global warming. Damn Bush. Damn people who don't give a f@#^ about the environment!  As I've said before, some things in life are impossible to forget. No matter where you go.
