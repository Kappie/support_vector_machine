Stop asking already. I orignally went there under XC's invitation. The Music Students are reciting their pieces. XC is playing his Pathetique peice. The recital started at 2.45pm. Most of them did well. Well done! XC keep critisizing the person who played Sweet Bye And Bye, because the person was using his piece for his Mid-Year 2002. HaHa! Yes yes XC. She sounded not as good as you. We keep talking and talking. I think Mr Low, who was sitting at the back, was very annoyed at our constant talking. Finally, the 21st person to perform was XC! And I was his page-turner for the day. What I did was basically turn the page whenever the XC says "turn". I was quite nervous then. I was waiting patiently for XC to play the first part so I can turn the page. And that part is so slow!! The second part he moved very fast. YaY! I love that part most. And all the while, I have to doge XC's hand when he reaches for the right side of the piano. HaHa! We finally ended. XC did well. Yeah. Everybody's praising him. So no worries la hor, XC! Good luck for your practical tomorrow!  Okay. Coming back home, I bathed and ate dinner. During which, I called Wendy to talk. She was having some problems of her own. I just listened to her and gave some helpful advices here and there. Well, I believe in the end, Wendy will be alright from this mess! I believe in her. After which, I told her about my own problems. It seemed that I have been very bitchy towards WQ. Why? I think, I wanted him to block me back. I was so confused. He said he would only talk to me after Os. Now he unblocked me. What is he trying to do? Talk to me again? And if he is, he isn't doing that lor. I don't want to recieve mixed signals anymore la! Wendy said instead of me waiting for him to talk, why not talk first? I was like....dunnoe. Obviously, I still can't bring myself to be ready to talk. I am just not lor. And I also kinda figured out why he's been negative towards me. He came online yesterday. I was so plerpexed why didn't he block me. I kept asking myself why....why... I finally figured out. I think he's experiencing the same thing. We are using our bitchiness to hide our true feelings. What is his? I do not know. Mine? I am starting for forgive and forget, but I can't still accept me forgiving and forgetting, in a sense. So I used anger and bitchiness to cover it up. Sigh. Now I look like a desperate cat right? I am not lor. I am NOT desperate.  Denial.    HaHa! We talked till 8pm pkus. I recorded Holland V. And my tutition teacher forgot that there's tutition today. Ha! Soi I got one free Wed night. After watching Charmed (about gyspy and Phoebe's powers), I went to sleep.  Today, I got back my Chem practical test. I got 11/15! YaY!!! I was so happy! I thought I would get 8-10 or something like that. Mrs Chew told us most scored around 8-9 ma....I just misread the theory question and did not include one point for observation and one wrong conclusion. Also, a yue wang mark was minused from me. In M1 test, blue litmus remaining blue is correct. But that stupid Rekha...go put "blue litmus turns red" in answer sheet, and lost the mark. Mrs Chew said remaining blue is correct, because H2CO3 is too weak an acid. Sigh! But oh well. I got 11. I should be happy. Some of my friends are worse off. Good luck next time, people! Pick yourself up and try and try again! You can do it!  Then, today nothing much happened. Just that at the end of school, I felt really pissed off at Hann. He's becoming more and more dangerous each day. Look what he did to CQ and me. It's atrocious! I felt really annoyed lor. Whatever la! Whatever!  I came home at 3 something. Took a bath, ate some eggs and went to watched the recorded Holland V. After tha, I played FFIX. Instead of revising. What for revise? I don't go around memorising essays and then finding out the next day that none of my memorised essay fits any theme. Rather silly if you ask me. Mrs Thong gave us a guide on compre essay. I'll just look over that tomorrow. Alright Alright. FFIX updates. I completed the Oeilvert le! YaY! Now I am running around the Magical Palace finding bloodstones to take away. And it's very hard fighting enemies if you onkly had one phyiscal fighter (which is not really reliable) and 3 magic users who use up their MPs very fast! Oh my!! Will continue playing some other time. Yeah!  After playing, ate dinner and watched Holland V. Then, came online and printed lots of stuff. Like Wendy's blogs, poem from her angel (such a nice poem!) and my prelim timetable. Then wrote blog! Ahh!! I am tried from typing le. So see ya tomorrow. Night blog!
