Dear "friends (and I use that term  very  loosely),"  Its a shame you don't know me that well.  I put on facades with people, just to see how they'll react.  Sadly, you two are a very shallow breed.  I wish you both a nice stay in hell.  People like yourselves are a curse to this earth.  If you actually would've taken the time to know me, you would've realized that was a facade I put on to humour myself with you two.  But, since you were shallow, it looks like it doesn't matter.  You both, are horrible people.  Rot in hell.  You mother fucking piles of shit.  Hopefully someday, you'll learn that toying with people's emotions have dire consequences.  (Hopefully you'll learn that by force...It'd be the only way to knock some sense into your thick skulls.)  People are not personal toys for you to fuck with.  Hopefully, someday, someone will be able to do this to you.  If I ever hear word of it.  I applaud whoever fucked you over royally.  Emotion is a very dangerous thing.  Sadly, you two probably won't understand this, being you have an IQ of possibly a fruit fly.  But, in closing.  Fuck you.  Fuck you both.  Rot in hell, you mother fucking piles of shit.  Forever and always,                    Patrick
