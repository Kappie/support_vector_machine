"all your friends are out by 6! even if aunt amy and uncle jack come over, they have to be out by 6." what the FUCK, they left at 6:05. and ok fine, be a bitch to your sister as long as it creates a clear example. "don't be loud." i closed my GODDAMN door when we were inside it. "make sure your friends take their shoes off and put them in the right place." WTF THEY DID. trying to find blame where THERE's NO BLAME TO FIND, when i'm the one that cooperates and my brother never does...i just want to call him so many things...right now i'll just settle for failure. failure to stay with my mom, making my mom's family constantly worried about her...failure to raise my worthless little brother right, so he lashes out at me...failure to be involved with my life, so i'm talentless and shy...bastard.
