I just thought for now I would address the Texas Bullrope match before The Great American Bash airs on Sunday (when I will watch the final Smackdown...and watch my friends tape of it on monday sometime)   Eddie Guerrero vs. John 'Bradshaw' Layfield  Texas Bullrope Match: Stipulations. Two superstars are tied together by a 'Texas Bullrope'. The bullrope is nearly 10 feet in length, and has a cowbell in the middle of it. You must wrestle your opponent with no disqualifacations (hit 'em with the cowbell or whatever) with only one way to win. Drag your opponent and touch all 4 turnbuckles.  This type of match you would think that JBL (John Bradshaw Layfield) would win simple as pie...but I dunno. I cant decide whether or not they will have JBL win it, and gain some heel heat...or to have Eddie keep the title (which I think they have run him as the champ for WAY too long...) and find a new rivalry to pursue...   My prediction:  JBL comes out victorious in a huge bloodbath!
