This is because I only got in a half hour ago for reasons i shall divulge to you all....now. The day started off pure shite as always, and i was desperately searching for anything at all to do to fill my time until i was tired enough to go to bed. I ended up just watching some pish on the Greek myths and playing the guitar for a wee bit. A phonecall from one Danny Bombscare soon changed my fortune. "Fancy coming up to mine for a wee drink or something?" and of course the answer was yes. A "wee drink or something" was not all we had however. We soon ran out of beer coz we are cheap and had minimum supplies, so Danny had the first-class idea of phoning up Gay Burn to see if he wanted to join in the fun with some of his famous Morrocan herbs. And, legend that the Gay is, true to his word he showed up and not only supplied us with some fucking mental hash but also taught us how to roll as well for nowt!! No denerio was needed, what a guy, hats off to the man. Me and Coongay ended up staggering from Dannys house in Mossend to the petrol station in Bellshill at half four in the morning looking for some juice and crisps, singing many Libertines songs on the empty streets of Bellshill. We were pretty monged. It's weird to think that about 7 hours earlier i had fuck all to do that night and was pleading with the clock to turn quicker so that i could retire after yet another day of routine boredom. I don't normally like it when things take a turn into the unknown, when things dont go the way theyre planned i tend to panic and worry a bit, especially around virtual strangers, I mean i dont even know Burn but he turned out to be bang on and I much prefer the way the night turned out. We were supposed to be going out somewhere tonight as well, originally we were meant to go to Dannys again coz his parents werent going to be in but it turns out they are, so then we were going to go out to a pub in Mossend but after last night it looks doubtful, im well tired (got about 3 and a half hours sleep on dannys wee brothers bed) and i still have to brave work tonight, i'll die if i have as much to do as i have had in recent evenings, shite job. So this is a testimonial to Mr Gary Burn, Bearded Bringer Of The Hashish. I salute you...and your beard.
