Thus comes the idea "why do I try, when I'm only gonna die?" Now some would say that this idea is just ridiculous, but think about it for a minute. Of course people want to think that their own lives were meaningful and in many ways it can be. My question is what pushes people further than this concept of being content with their lives? What makes people strive to do things for others? If you look at history you might find several thousand names out of millions of people that actually made enough difference to be recognized. This fact in its self is very depressing. The chances of you making a difference in history are like a million times worse than you winning the lottery. So back to my original question. Why do people do the things they do? I mean survival is a given. Then again there are people that live on the streets and still survive. It may not be a luxurious existence, but they are living all the same. So does that mean that people do the things they do to get the things they want? That's a much better way to look at life. There are people that work hard to obtain what they want and there are those that take what they want. It's the basis of the whole criminal element. Not wanting to work for things in a way that is excepted by society. I mean being a criminal cannot be easy. The risks they face are far worse than getting laid off and not having a job. For criminals there is a lot more at stake. Yet, they still take risks and do things their way. At the same time the way in which they obtain things is shunned by the rest of society. So in a sense everyone has to fit into the views society to achieve success. People can live their lives as good as they know and have great friends, but in the end everyone still dies alone. That is what is so odd about life. No matter what you do, or who you are, the end is always the same. The moral of this post is that everyone should live their lives the best they know how and make every minute count. For eventually we all just end up as a pile of fucking dust. And even worse is that we will be forgotten and no amount of achievement will ever erase this cycle of life. Living every day like it is your last is the best idea anyone ever had because no one knows what tomorrow will bring.
