Today was a bit more special than most Saturdays though, as it was my first time doing some work around the house since...shovelling the driveway in winter probably? Yeah I know I'm a lazy kid, which is why I actually did something for a change today.  Well my lazy day started at 1130 or so, waking up after dreaming about some REALLY stupid things again. I dreamt that I somehow became some zoologist in the Outback hunting down rare animals, and for some reasons hyenas live there now, and yeah...then I woke up after I caught it with my "team." It was weird I know. Anyways after I woke up, went to brush teeth and stuff, and then ate lunch. Jason called and said he'd be at my place around 3 so he can get a lift to HYPE, but eventually he delayed it to 5pm. So after eating, I decided to play NFL street for a bit, until my dad told me I should help with some work. I agreed, and this is actually the first time I did work WITHOUT pay...  Yes this concept is still somewhat new to me, I mean work without pay? But I agreed to, and then my first job was to fill in a crack in the side of the house with concrete. It was actually somewhat amusing for some reason, and I really enjoy doing stupid things like that. So while I was doing that, dad went to grab gas for the lawnmower. I managed to do most of the work, but when dad came back he put the finishing touches on it anyways. So while he was putting on finishing touches *mostly just smoothening out concrete* I went back downstairs and played some PS2.  After a bit of that, I then used the lawnmower, something I haven't used in almost 2 years. Yeah I've been VERY lazy. So I cut most of the backyard lawn, well until the gas ran out, and then dad took over after the gas refill. We kinda switched jobs, he mowed and I trimmed with that weed/grass trimmer thing. It was pretty fun...well until I ran into the swingset in my backyard from my childhood days. I forgot I'm a bit taller then from when I was little, so yeah...ow. Well, after trimming all the grass, and mowing the lawn, AND filling in cracks on the house with concrete, I can  NOW  truly say.... *quote taken from Rona*   "I AM A HANDYMAN!" =P   Well after the actually productive afternoon, Jason just got to my place, and we played some NFL Street before we had to leave for HYPE. Well actually I ate first, Jason played some NBA street, AND THEN we left to Vince's place for the HYPE movie night.  Well when I got there, apparently they were going to go back to blockbuster since the movie they got, "Secondhand Lions" is crap according to Gavin. So I called shotgun, jacked Rebecca's shotgun seat, and off we went to Blockbuster's.  You never know how hard it is to rent a movie with minimal violence/sexual content UNTIL you actually have to TRY to. Since the HYPE meeting is a church event, we had to find something that SORT OF goes along with it. So in the end, we got the movie "Radio." I was going to see that in theatres originally, but I don't know what got in the way of it. Meh, so I finally got to see it tonight, and I heard it's a pretty good movie, so we all agreed to get it.  Getting back to Vince's, Some people were downstairs playing PS2. Andy showed up today, which I thought was pretty cool that he took up the courage to come to the HYPE meeting with people like us haha. Rise to Honour actually looked like a pretty cool game, but of course with us there, we made the game look stupid as we do with any game =P. For example:  "BREAKDANCE DAMN YOU!" *Spins right analog stick rapidly and Jet Li does a flare* -Jason "LEI YEE WAI LEI HO GING?! NGOR JUONG GING GOR LEI!" -Josh and Gavin butchering a line from the game "Hey look public fire barrels for the hobos. I never knew Hong Kong was THAT generous" -Jason  Well after playing that for a bit, we finally started watching the movie, with Vince still trying to figure out a good message haha. In the end though I don't think there was a CLEAR intended message, but to me the movie spoke about determination and also the care that humans SHOULD have for one another. There was actually a line in the movie where Ed Harris' character spoke about Radio as someone who treats people the way many of us would want others to treat us. I thought the movie was really good. First drama I appreaciate in a while heh. Even with that in the bag though, us being us HYPErs still managed to make it look somewhat dumb sadly.  "Whoa, that place is like the white Barbershop" "Is that his daughter?" "No it's his mother." "You'll never know, they're rednecks." "He didn't say thank you for the coffee." "Imagine if that banner they run through was made out of rubber. Then they'd bounce off of it....HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA." "HAHAHAHA that white guy's the only one laughing"  And the jokes go on and on, but those are some that I remember, for either the sheer stupidity or it was actually funny at the moment. Oh yeah and throughout the movie, Dan would pretend to flex, then say some really random thing in a deep football-imitating voice haha. I still don't see how we managed to poke fun at a movie like that. Yup....maturity at it's best ehehe...  After the movie, some of us went to ball, others stayed downstairs playing PS2. I kinda did both, but more playing PS2 w/ Rebecky and Brian. Watching Rebecky play PS2 is actually pretty funny, so I don't regret my descision haha. Afterwards they all came in, and we played some NBA Live 2004 for a bit. Jason played Rebecky first, and like usual Rebecca was shrieking, yelling, and screaming through the whole game as she mashes the buttons on the controller as well as a potato masher mashes potatoes. Played a bit of that, then had to drive Jason back to his place, and of course myself back home.  So here I am now, bloggin' yet again, reflecting back on my day. Tomorrow we have joint service, so service starts at 11am. Bible Study's around 9:15am or so though, so no sleeping in =(. Oh well, I wonder what stupid things will happen to me tomorrow haha.  Oh yeah Maisie leaves tomorrow too for wherever her cadet camp tomorrow. And in her own words...  "Aww Poor Muffin." Except this time it's probably directed to her =P.  Later.
