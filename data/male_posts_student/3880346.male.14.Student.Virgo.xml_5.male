I need a diary, but I dun wan it where my siblings or parents can browse through it at their leisure! Besides, i think it shd be quite nice to have somewhere where i can say juz wat i wan to say. I wonder though, if any1 will eva bother to read wad im typing anyway, other than myself. On another note, who will i wan to read this? at most maybe timwee, or other trusted pple. Anyway, I am starting this blog! gotta get going!
