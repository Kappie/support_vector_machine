Or perhaps it is I who am floating away, and they are still on land. It all looks the same, nonetheless.  You know, I haven't had a girlfriend in more than two years. I haven't even gotten laid!  There is one girl out there who really cares about me, she likes me a lot. We've been friends for a while, but I just don't feel the same way about her. It's making her miserable. The body count rises, dammit.  It hurts, it physically hurts. All over. I haven't slept in days. I barely sleep when I do. When I do, it's nightmare filled and unsettling. Today I watched the sunrise. It hurt like hell.  I can't even afford a god damned shrink! I don't have the god damned money, hell, most of the populous doesn't! I can't fucking be helped. Everything everyone says, every word of comfort, just fails to help. Fails miserably. The thing that keeps me alive, is the thing that keeps me dead. I wouldn't trade it for anything...But that doesn't change the pain.   Yes. Yes, she did hurt me a lot. Yes I mention it a lot. I'm not trying to rub it inher face. I don't hate her for hurting me, I don't want her to feel sad because of me. I just need to get some things off of my chest.  I wouldn't change how things are right now. If I could go back and time and change something, I wouldn't. I wouldn't change it for the world. I know I am supposed to be right fucking here.   The nights are colder, lonlier and longer than ever, and I'm going off my god damned rocker. Jesus, have you read any of my poetry lately? No sane man writes shit like that. Look at Stan Rice! HA!
