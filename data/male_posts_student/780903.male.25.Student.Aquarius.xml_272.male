See me sit up front, see me lift my chair up high See me start to twitch and tremor See the glimmer in my eye See me sort of smirk, just a little, hardly there The professor turns around And my hand is in the air  Oh, I got a hand for you A hand in the air for you  Yesterday, I had not read the case But I have thoughts, so you should listen Or just keep staring into space This class is mine, all mine and nothing more Let me step up onto my soapbox Captive students, hear me roar  'Cause I got a hand for you A hand in the air for you  Raise my hand, I just have to raise my hand Raise my hand, I'll tell you what I think About everything Raise my hand, everything you ought to hear Because I will be talking The most that, the most that I can  See, I was quiet, but I was in denial About how much I had to offer And how my words are so worthwhile I raised my hand, and then I screamed aloud And all the eyes were focused on me I felt big and smart and proud  Now I got a hand for you A hand always up for you  Raise my hand, I just have to raise my hand Raise my hand, hearing me talk makes me feel grand Raise my hand, maybe I can't get an A but I want to raise it, the most that... The most that I can
