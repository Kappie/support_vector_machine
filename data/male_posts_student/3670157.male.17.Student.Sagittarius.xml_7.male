And it's kind of hard writing poety when no one is giving me something to write about hint hint. Anyway enjoy.  You feeling down What can you do look all around Who can help you  He'll lift your head high don't watch your feet look towards the sky there you will meet  If you make the choice where would your sorrow be when you follow His voice and He sets you free  He'll lift your head high don't watch your feet look towards the sky there you will meet
