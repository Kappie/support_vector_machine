You see, when Caroline came over jones yesterday, obviously being together, i was like "ehhhh", not cause they were snuggling, but cause i know i couldn't do it in awhile.  I also noticed they talk alot, something i would love to do more with lilia, so during that whole night i wanted to talk to her, and i was, but i was getting ansy.  Anyway, i forget how it comes to be, but benny let's me borrow his cell phone to call Lilia. (thanx again man)So i end up calling her...ya, it was great to talk to her.  We did the usual how are you, whacha been up to thing, and then we started talking about random shit.  But random shit is good.  Anyway, eventually jones was kicking us out to have "alone time" with caroline...more on that later though.  So i get home and call lil again, and end up talking until like 3...it was VERY refreshing...She's just that kind of person you need to hear from..like, a comedian or something, like, you always wanna hear what they have to say.  But ya, the events of that next morning is probably what turned me off to going to antioch that night.  Caroline IM's me, and it's the usual.  But, caroline likes to talk about what her and jones did or whatever.  Well, anyway, she tells me, but, like, it was like, i dunno, i guess the was she put it, like, it was like, weird.  And i guess all this stuff put together just got me upset.  Probably cause of the night before.  Like, Caroline went over, and we were all suppose to hang out.  But like, the whole time, her and jones kept on talking privately and stuff, and i dunno, it was like we weren't there...now, i have no problem with this, i understand that there time together is limited, but i dunno, i guess it was just the fact that they were doing it, i dunno, i just wasn't feeling it.  And i guess that emotion mixed in with the one that i got when caroline told me that they were together a lot longer then usual...like, it was almost like she "hung out" with us, just so she can say we did, and then go streight to jones...once again i know whats up, and it dosn't bother me, but, like, still, ya know?  Anyway, so ya, after that, i just couldn't handle it anymore, and i swiftly said good bye to Caroline on the internet, and i appologize for that caroline, if your reading this.  But ya, so after that, i really didn't want to go to antioch.  And i'm not mad at her, but, like, at the moment i was, but i'm cool now.  I appreciate that we have the kind of relationship were she's comfortable enough to tell me these things, it's great, but, like, i don't have to hear about it everyday, ya know? It's nice, and sometimes it makes a good conversation peice, but not during every single conversation.  Just think of it as everytime i talk to you guys, i talk about lilia, or i start a conversation with you, i talk about lilia. you know, it's kind of like that.  But ya, thats pretty much why i didn't go to antioch...childish? ya, i'd say so, but it blew over faster that way...i ended up staying at home...i was ABOUT to go to the diner, but when i was going, my mom said my dad is bringing home dinner, so i thought i would eat before i go...he ended up taking awhile, and it turned out to be too late, and my parents weren;t letting me out.  So there you have it.  I'm not mad at caroline, quite the opposite, it's just that at that moment, i was alittle bitchy i suppose.  O, that, and a long day of doing laundry and cleaning the house didn't help either. :o/  ok, now that thats done, what else....i already mentioned how great it was talking to lil, and why i wasn't at antioch...well, i guess the only other thing i can comment on is what jones said about college....we ARE fucked...and ya, we did stay up for that long discussing it.  I mean, shit, what else can we do? You can't blame us...this was one of the topics i was talking to lilia about when i came home that night.  I'm sure caroline and jones have talked about it too.  Basically, college guys own us...and if you haven't read jones' entry already, here's why.  1. Proximity: The obvious, and probably the most powerful advantage they have over us is Proximity, or there distance is you haven't taking English before (damn ESL kids..).  As jones said, i AM closer to lil than he'll be to Caroline, but where still a good distance away.  Caroline is about a 3-4 hour drive, while lil' will prolly be a good 30-40 minute drive.  So yeah, but either way, this really sucks.  Cause not only will those guys be close, but they be there like everyday.  So even if we visit, which we are, they still be there ALL the time, while we'll be there only acouple times.  More than enough time to work getting the girls...  2. Age: Though this isn't a big deal for jones, for me it's a BIG one.  I have a "late" birthday, which basically means i'm younger than most of the kids in my grades...i'm still 16, and i'll continue to be until the end of September.  Lil' has a sept. birthday too, which makes her almost exactly a year older than me...suureee, i know about the trends...more girls are going out with guys younger than them and shit, but with age comes expeirence, and that's probably why girls like older guys.  Now, i'm not saying i don't experience, but shit, they're older!  Jones dosn't have to worry about this...he's the "correct" age...he's just as old as the graduating seniors. But me...VERY young...not cool....I can see it now..."so, how old is your b/f....WHAT!.....you need a older man....."......fucking bastards...  3. College: Their in college for crying out loud...were still in high school....party's anyone?  Shit, and your with some crazy girl saying "go for it! he's cute!"....then all these other advantages these guys have come to mind....FACK....  4. Classes:  It's very highly likely that most of the guys hitting on the girls will be from one of their classes.  This obviously shows that they have SOME kind of mutual intrests, and thats how it starts. And even if they DON'T have the same intrests, guys will lie....sorry to bust our shit guys, but it's true, i've done it, you've done it, everyone has...some of us more than others.  I mean think about it, the more you have in common, the better right? then the whole courtship process begins...errrrrrrrrr....  5: Numbers: Croton...even ossining....the selction of guys are slim to none...i consider myself very lucky to go out with lilia...and like i've said, i've told her...i'm pretty sure jones feels the same way..but...in college...the guy population increases..TEN FOLD!. Sure, most of them will most likely be assholes, but shit, theres BOUND to be guys like me and jones there..fuck, you know what? it's garuanteed.  And maybe they'll have some characterisitics that makes them a "better" version of us....ya...FUCK.  But, ya, in a nutshell, thats the problem.  And the reason why college SUCKS.   hmm, what else...photo gallery is going down, but i'm not surprised.  I've never seen a website that david made longer than acouple of months, he always drops them..but w/e, czzank's got em' now.  I'm not mad or anything.  i need doom 3 right now.  hmm...thats about it....this is my last week of summer school, and that lady at Shop rite still hasn't shown up....yay.....  Playing way to much NFSU... steve
