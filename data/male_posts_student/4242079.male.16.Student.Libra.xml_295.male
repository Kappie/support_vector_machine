I bought their poster off of ebay, so I figured I'd order the CD from HMV, and holy poop on a stick, it has got to be one of the best CDs I have ever heard. Lyrics are the heart and sould of any song, and this CD rules!  Here:       Five Kids Go  by Hell Is For Heroes    five kids go Do you have the time to kill Let's go head for the shore Do you have the will to jump Down from the top of the world If it's easier to burn Tie me up on a stake  Empty high roads are calling, calling My defences are slowly breaking down  Fuck these headstrong scheming plans Let's go head for the shore On my last legs i'll take a stand And jump from the top of the world If it's easier to burn Tie me up on a stake Fire is my only friend now  Empty high roads are calling, calling My defences are slowly breaking Fuck your well-trained golden handshake All we need is space to roam  All we have left is self-control All we have to do is pack up and go  So catch me falling if you can Cut your ties and flush them down Coz we're taking back the rein Take control of time
