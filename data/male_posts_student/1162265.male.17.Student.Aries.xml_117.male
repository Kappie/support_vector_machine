That was amazingly (suprisingly?) fun.  Cousins from Dover, and there kids also came over, they really complain to much, but whatever, this is the first time in a long time that they've been over.  So that day went well, infact once I'm done writting I'm going to get some left over steak.  Yummm......    So yesterday, we got to see the Cousins from Washington, w00t.  They'd come in Saturday, but we gave them that day to settle into NYC.  Lucky them, because the Make-a-Wish Foundation put them up in the Hilton in Times Square!  I can only think of two Hotels that are better and that'd be the Marriot and the Plaza (and the Plaza is to Bougie...).  So we saw them, walked around a bit, and finally settled on this one tiny resturant around 50th Street and 7th Ave.  It was pretty nice eating there, got to catch up with the Cousins.  Then we walked back to the Hotel, passing by Times Square and having my dad point at certain sites.  Like eighteen guys approached Scott trying to sell him stuff.  I liked the guy who walked by him casually and asked if he wanted a bag of Hip-Hop and R CD's.  So we got back to the Hotel eventually, and bid them good day until Tuesday (Sarah is going to St. Barnabus for some treatment).  So we walked across the street to the Coldstone Creamery, to see what this place is all about (they're opening one in SO).  It was pretty good stuff, but they treat Ice Cream like an art there, and it's very formal (I guess that'd be a good word).
