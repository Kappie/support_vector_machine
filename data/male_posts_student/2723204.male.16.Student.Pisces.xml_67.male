But really, was really emotional and sitting beside Woon Han also, so naturally I'll be more open since the subject of my love life was breached. Yea, so I'll give you an update on my life which is kinda rare lol. Hmmm, I seem to have slacked more, maybe because its uhhh "revision"? But yea, I actually prefer studying now, its really amazing. Reading more intellectual books really helps, I consider it a privellage to learn about stuff in school, especially science.  Because I see that the world is so vast, and what I'm learning is just peanuts. So yea, I actually find that learning stuff keeps me in perspective and gives me insight on things around me. But I guess physics today was more......emotional? I hope that I'll do better for my chem tho, ganbatte, cos' I dunnoe my chinese results.  I've got a busy day ahead tomorrow and I'm still writing at almost 1 am now, cos' I slept, 6-10pm, bad for my sleep patterns yea I know. Mostly guitar stuff tomorrow, wanna sign up for the comp. on the 28th ! Can win a pacifica, the higher end ones, and I need to go to plaza Sing. to sign up, crap. Wanna get my guitar fixed, intonation and stuff like that. Hopefully can do a few mods, for free, i hope, cos' its still under warranty.  I hope to spend more time at the library during the weekend, reading about stuff. I'm really interested in the history of science especially during the enlightenment age, I have recently acquired an interest for the sociology of science and quantum physics. Have not really read about quantum physics yet, but the whole thing about a Grand Unified Theory (GUT), quarks and gluons really have sparked my interest.   Have I mentioned that I want to do physics in the U, nuclear physics is what I'm interested now, don't think I'll do quantum, but I'll see what goes afterI'm somewhat satisfied with my education in the social sciences that is. But don't worry, I won't be doc ock. Nuclear physics is really something which has revolutionized our view of the universe and society as a whole, I really hope to find certain ways in which nuclear energy can be harnessed in as safe a way as possible. Its my personal belief that nuclear energy is the energy source for the future, but I guess we need to be able to handle it well enough.  I endorse efforts to slow down on nuclear development, because I don't think we would be able to handle it. Also, cold fusion has struck my interest as well, and I'm gonna do some reading on that, I'm all too familiar with the 300+ and 100+ sections in the library, time to get into the physical sciences now, oh God, I guess I'm turning into a nerd.
