That is because about 2 days after i posted my modem fell and broke!!! i had to switch services and pay for the modem, i got it all setup just the other day so i never goto write in this. HA my mom blames me for the modem even though it was noone that is what really pisses me off she keeps thinking im lieing i mean geez, just because i lie sometimes doesnt mean i lie 24/7. Yesterday i saw spiderman 2 it was wicked, better then i thought i think it was better then the first one, and they sure set us up for the next one. I think the next one there will be 2 villains teamed up. I cannot wait to get doom 3. I am downloading it as we speak, been waiting for this game for a long while, i have a feeling it is going to be wicked.
