I hate wakin up at night on account of I sleep when everyone is awake. And im awake when everyone is asleep. GAWDAYM its boring. Im glad I got some zombies to talk with on the computer but thats boring too.  Well, im off, another short one, I need to get to sleepin right.  Today's Message from Erwin: The nightlife, either you enjoy it, or you dont.
