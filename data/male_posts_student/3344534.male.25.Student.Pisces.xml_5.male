Nostalgia ,  Cracker        And here's Ivanovich       in his rocket ship       Spinning helplessly       up above the earth        While his heart is splintered,       All the girls of winter       are buried in their coats anonymous        While winter girls are waiting,       Ivanovich in high rotation       is just another star       up in the sky.        And while the world was waiting,       We're overwhelmed by some sensation       of something long ago and far away        Like General Jackson's arm       it's buried on some farm       While the fever       pushes words from his lips        And by the drunken river       where the soldiers shiver       We rest beneath the shade of the trees        While winter girls are saying       each of us a tiny nation,       You're just another star       but so am I.        And while the world was waiting       We're overwhelmed by some sensation       of something long ago and far away
