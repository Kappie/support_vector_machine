Great BBQ at Denise's place this past Monday. Reluctantly took part in a couple of rounds of Singstar... the PS2 karaoke game. Then I decided... what the hell... it might actually be a little fun to further mangle an already bad song. But, there's no way I'm singing some loser pop song. Those things have a way of catching up with you later on. And so I browse... until... the most perfect choice comes up. It's a rock song alright, but it's also cheesy enough for me to dislike it.  I'm talking about the one and only "I Believe In A Thing Called Love" by The Darkness. It's the stuff that karaoke nightmares are made of. And so the song begins... dust off the once-flashy one-piece leotard catsuit... rehearse Pete Townshend's windmill technique and break out the Freddie Mercury falsettos. I'm not proud to say that I actually pulled it off quite well... at least I beat Roussel by 1500 points.  Wednesday was supposed to be Paintball day. Plans fell apart 2 minutes to midnight... quite literally. I did get the msg from Evans around that time. So, in the end, the highlights of that day turned out to be KFC, bowling, pool, air hockey, shooting arcade hoops and a very colourful display of thong. Imagine if you will, the colours magenta, violet and rouge all on a tiny piece of cloth... you'll get the picture.  Quite eventful, all in all. At least when compared relatively to my standard 24 hours of time on this revolving mass that we call Earth.
