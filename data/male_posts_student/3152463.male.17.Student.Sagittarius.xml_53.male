I managed to acquire all the leaflets, guides, and booklets regarding the exhibition that you can possibly imagine. On the way to London Paddington, I read  The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide , which is the best source of information about the production of The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy that I found at the time of writing.    Anyway, upon arrival in London (or Lon Don as it is referred to by Tubbs in that rather obscure television and radio series  The League of Gentlemen ), I made for Covent Garden, and the Tintin Shop which is located at 34 , Floral Street.Below is photographicevidenceof how that marvellous establishment looked on Saturday, 10th July.           I was rather pleased with my purchases of that trip, which included two T shirts, several books and a keyring featuring the logo from the Tintin musical,  Tintin Et Le Temple Du Soleil . On my way back to my hotel, I stumbled upon a Swatch shop in Covent Garden, and promptly purchased a Tintin watch. Where I'm from, that's what we call a very eventful day. The following morning - on my way to the exhibition- I discovered a wonder of London Public Transport :  The Docklands Light Railway . For the unfortunate souls amongst you who have not had a ride on this 'highway in the sky' - to coin a phrase, I will try to explain this jewel in London's crown. Basically, The Docklands Light Railway isa monorail system, very much in the style of the Underground, except of course that it's two storeys above the ground, and goodness knows how many above the 'underground'. I know - that sentence explains absolutely nothing, and you're probably thinking that its sole purpose is to pad out this otherwise dry, dull text. If you think that, then you're reminding me of Marvin (the paranoid android of 'the guide'), and I suggest you stop reading as soon as possible. Anyway, back to the Docklands Light Railway. This incredible ride 'zooms' past tower blocks, until it finally comes to ground level to cross the river like an underground train. The 'Cutty Sark (for Maritime Greenwich) is the station needed to access the National Maritime Museum , where the exhibition is located. I found an Ottakar's Bookshop right outside the station, and -you should haveguessed- I bought three Tintin postcards.
