Secondly, while I lurve me some lyrics (my love of Bob Dylan proves this), I even more greatly lurve me some good instrumentals.(My love of Leo Kottke proves this) And sadly, most new bands are in love with the Let's Just Wail On This Thing And Turn The Volume Up To Eleven, Fuckers!  Thirdly, Amanda, sometimes your bouts of unsanity scare me. (Yes, unsanity. I know.)  Fourthly (?), on with the history of the Deeyundee campaign! Rawk!  So, we left off with the realization that the C'tan were badass mama jammas, and that we only have two months til they arrive. We'll skip past the Us Kicking the Collective Asses of the C'tan Forward Invasion Troops, and straight into the part that matters...their arrival! It was another perfect tropical day, and we had just returned from a little subterranean tete-e-tet with the Shadow Dragon, Wraith. Much to our surprise, there happened to be the very object of our questing for the past two months: The Multiplanar Fortress of the C'tan. Naturally, Delebar wastes no time, activates a quick bit of magic, and streaks off into the air, heading straight towards those C'tan bastards. All of the cannons lock onto the poor pirate and begin shelling. With a bit of quick reflexes and some quick shield work, he gets through the worst of it. Very soon, he's too close to the fortress for the big guns to do much good, and in fact, he's so close that he recognizes a C'tan perched precariously on a spire of the fortress. Wasting no time, he gives a battle cry and charges bravely forth, only to be repelled by some foul psionic treachery of the C'tan bastard. Caught off-guard by this deflection of his mighty blow, the C'tan removes its blindfold...and that's that. Delebar no longer exists. The fucker used its most powerful trick up its sleeve, the Armageddon Gaze. It basically removes the person so affected from existence. They never existed, and no one remembers them. Fucker. Blah blah, yadda yadda, good triumphs, the C'tan are overthrown, blah blah blah, we win, whatever. Del's dead, worse than dead in fact.  You may notice I'm just a wee bit bitter about the whole thing. I took that cavalier sunnovabitch pirate bastard from his fledgling 1st level self to a mighty, epic 28th level. He was the stuff legends are made of. The best of men. *sniffle*  -Dice Squirrel Sad Rodent  PS: Damn you, Joe! Corpse fucker! *grin*
