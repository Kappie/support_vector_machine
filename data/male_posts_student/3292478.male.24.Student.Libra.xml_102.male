She tried to make some new friends but struggled because of her fear of water. Hope came in the form of Howard the duck who offered to look after her, he even offered to introduce her to his brothers and sisters. But this was all a BIG FAT LIE!!! There were no brothers and sisters, just a big puddle of tar!   "Swim in this, seeing as you don't like water!"  He quacked!  Luckily Angie has been on hand to give her a good shower down and a glass of lime cordial.
