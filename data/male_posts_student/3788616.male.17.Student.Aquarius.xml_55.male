Anyway, it happens this way such that it began with a National Day celebration which was damn dead till it reached to the singing part with Mr Patrick Sum, Mr Mark Ng as well as Mrs Chia i think, but then, the moment it hit the 2nd song, everything was like quite hype and many of us ended up singing and standing up on the chairs letting our hairs down! The teachers did it too! haha... by the the end, almost everyone was up on the chair! haha... it was pretty enjoyable to see the AC spirit flowing through! Let's go ACJC! :p  Anyway, after that, a group of us went to buy the gifts for the J2s, i think at the end of it all, we picked some really cool gifts lah! haha... but anyway, the highlight of the whole thing wasn't about the gifts buying... oh! but, i did get to know a new friend! haha... Dawn from BRMC and my school! She's in J2! haha... she really has a lively deposition that gives you a comfortable and bubbly feeling! haha... anyway, it's really nice to know her! haha... the MOST interesting one though was that of Lance and Jill lah! haha... so scandalous! haha, i know it's not really nice of me to say this, but aiyo those 2 ah! I tell you, super cannot take it lah! everyone was like, oh man, those 2 are, really like couple lah! Wah lau! haha... so yeah, i think i made a huge statement there lah!  Ok, anyway, here's another thing... went out with Benjamin, Wan Yi and Cherie today! haha... they are really a fun bunch to be with and hang out with lah! It made me realise how little i am having fun as well as how long a period of time it has been since i've been myself... but anyway, made new friends too, Christy, Debra, LiQing (or something like that), Mary-sheryl (something like that lah)! haha... Yup! so nice to make new friends! haha... but as usual, i was the butt of most of the jokes we cracked, guess it was SCD (Suan Colin Day) again! But anyway, it was really nice to know more about Cherie yeah... haha... she has a lively and hmm, i don't know, this infectious character that helps you to be cheerful and happy around her! haha... and damn it! She's 166 lah! Same height as me! GRR!!! ok, moving on, anyway, do hope that she comes to our church soon lah! haha... good to see her around more often!  Ok, here's addressing Kelly and to all those around there yeah! 1st things 1st is that, i am not blaming you (Kelly) for anything! i am not unhappy either, certainly at times i am depressed and down, but nevertheless, i am still happy that you are my friend! so yeah, don't take it as i am blaming you for anything and neither do i wish to see you thinking that i am unhappy because of you yeah... But anyway, Kelly, all i can say is that, i don't expect anythng really, i just hope that you do know how i feel and that you'll know that in the end, no mattter the outcome, i will always be a friend to you! Do take care of yourself and have lots of fun! That's all that matters to me, your safety and happiness...  ok, i think i've become rather long winded recently, but anyway, take care everybody! To my friend who has been depressed over that stupid girl, just forget her and move on, she's not worth it! to my other friend, don't give up! You haven't even tried anything yet! just wait 1st after the 'A's than do something! heex... to the rest, i am always here for you all! Take care and smile everyone! (",)
