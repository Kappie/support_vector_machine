On your computer screen, outside, your alarm clock, the sun, and even the computer screen you look at.  Photons travel at speeds up to 300,000 kilometers per second. They are invisible to the naked eye.  Unfortunately, that's just the facts. Photons have killed and can kill many.  The largest concentration of photons happens outside during the daytime. This is the biggest place for a photonic accident. Next in line comes indoors at day, indoors at night, and outdoors at night.  Urban areas are infested with photons, while rural and suburban areas experience them in the daytime.  Some common sources of photons are your computer screen, televisions, the sun, digital alarm clocks, street lights, stoplights, lamps, fire, lightbulbs, cameras, and more. In the digital age, it's impossible to escape all these sources, but it is possible to expose yourself to as little as possible.  Doctors are warning patiens that intense photons from the sun can cause sunburn, or even skin cancer in most cases. Photons can dry up water and drain the crucial nutrient from our lakes, rivers, and your own bathtub, leaving millions of people dying in droughts.  In an intense ray, photons can cause eye problems, even blindness in rare cases. Studies show that people whose eyes are exposed to too many photons can get eye disorders.  Photons are virtually unstoppable. They are, right now, bouncing off your hands, feet, face, and your little brother.  Here are some ways to avoid this menace: 1. You must stay inside at all times, being wary when going outside. The best time to go outside is when it's raining. The majority of photons are being blocked by the clouds. 2. Don't use a flash camera. Those give off dangerous photonic radiation. Instead, turn the flash off. 3. Stay away from fire. 4. Turn off the computer and T.V. when you go to bed, or at least turn down the brightness. 5. Make sure the lights are off during the daytime, and read your book with the dimmest light possible. 6. Keep all water sources away from photonic radiation. 7. Cover up the front part of your digital clock with black tape when you're not using it. 8. ALWAYS wear sunglasses when driving. 9. Do not go to tanning salons. The photonic radiation from the ultraviolet waves can cause skin cancer. 10. Wear protective clothing when going into the sunlight. If the sun gets too bright, hide under a tree or a desk. Always bring an umbrella.
