Well lets see...looking ahead i have my church picnick and then im going to a reunion in San Fran. The reunion is for my mom's old church called SFBC, once part of the CBM chain, and its their 30-40 year reunion. haha i wouldnt know b/c i dont even go there. So i think that day ill dress up in the nice stuff. Then i go on vacation again and when i get back its...CBM camp! YOU KNOW IT! I cant wait to go, its going to be soooooooooooo fun especially since its my last year of jr. high camp.   Looking back....well this summer has been i guess pretty good. Im really busy with my job and now that i have been voted as vice president of SOS, im sure more fun schtuff will pop up that needs to be done. I wish i had more time this summer to start my eagle project and get atleast some of it done, but i find my so self so busy with other stuff that im way to lazy/tired to start anything.   Today.....was so boring. There was no one in line to buy funnel cakes so all day i just sat there trying not to look too bored. I was sooooooooooo glad once it was all over. Lets see what else to say....no one ever talks to me online anymore...o yeah and if you actually read these posts about my life then leave a comment b/c i would really appreciate it and also so i can see who reads it.   Prayers: -New building for my church -SOS -Great Aunt and Uncle -Uncle George from Canada -Time in general
