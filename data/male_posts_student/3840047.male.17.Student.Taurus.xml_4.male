In English we where given the task of writing a persuasive essay,on any given contraversial topic, regardless of personal belief. We chose capital punishment. and here is the result. Enjoy ...                                                                                          					           			  In this age of wonder we have arrived at the very apex of technological advancement, we have pondered the inexplicable intricacies of creation, and presumptuously we take pride in the establishment of a civilized society. Yet have we indeed reached the pinnacle of our societal potential? The history of man is embellished by achievement, yet marred by atrocity, and whilst we acknowledge these superficial achievements, we pay no heed to the blatant abhorrence that has been incorporated into the root of in this nation. What age do we live in that advocates death in place of a chance at repentance, that establishes vengeance as an integral factor in its judiciary system, that zealously supports the practice of legalized murder in the name of personal retribution? We have erred. We have staryed from the path proposed by the founders of this nation. Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, these ideals embody the aspirations of our forbearers. This nation was founded upon these immutable principles; this nation founders gave their lives in the hope that their children would realize, would actualize these three essential principles. Instead we have tarnished their legacy, tainting such magnanimous an institution as Justice with the barbaric, anachronistic practice of capital punishment.  The morals of America have been sold, replaced by inherently capitalistic ethics. We are governed by the dollar; it has infiltrated our minds erasing our ethics, replacing them with capitalistic greed. So it comes to no surprise that some would dare to measure the significance of life, in terms of dollars, and of cents. It comes to no surprise that some would weigh the significance of sentient human life, in terms of tax dollars. It comes to no surprise that the leaders of this nation would dare to place a price tag on life, on liberty, and on justice. Yet let us for a moment address the issue of cost, as it seems that some are governed more by the pocketbook than by logic. The supporters of this depraved institution proclaim that their hard earned tax dollars should not go towards sustaining the life of one deemed unfit to live in our civilized society, that the upkeep of these miscreants drains our tax reserves, therefore the cheap butchery of these malefactors would indeed be a sound solution. Yet in this fallacious, unfounded argument lies the greatest deceit of all. In a compilation of data by the state governments of the United States of America it is estimated that a single case warranting the death penalty, from point of arrest to execution ranges from $1 million to 3$ million. Other studies have even estimated that this figure is as high as 7 $ million. Cases resulting in life imprisonment average around $ 500, 000 each for a 60 year life sentence.  The American public has been fooled, you have been indoctrinated with lies, the backers of capital punishment have insulted you with their treachery and still you rally blindly behind their cause? Not only is life long imprisonment much less expensive than capital punishment, but state spending on capital punishment is directly linked to the degradation of funding available for expenditure on essential public services. It is Ironic that 500 police officers where laid off in the state of New Jersey as a direct effect of the implementation of the death penalty. It is Ironic that the very entity that stands between the upholding citizens, and the criminals, between the single mother in a low-income development and the neighborhood thug, between your children, and the pernicious, predatory rapists, is being directly weakened by capital punishment. Yet let us embark on a theoretical tangent. If in fact it were cheaper to execute these offenders, does this validate the taking of a human life? Can any value be placed on a human life? When did we decide that that money is the equivalent of the pursuit of happiness? Or more importantly when did we come to the audacious conclusion that we could balance the scales of life with money, and negate a God given right. It has also been stated that capital punishment acts as a crime deterrent. That by instilling the fear of punishment by death will deter a possible offender from committing their crime. By making such a presumption we presume that the people who commit these crimes are in full possession of all their capacities, that murder is always premeditated, and that these criminals stop to access the pros and cons of such an act. Yet the basis of many an argument supporting capital punishment is that by committing as irrational an act as homicide, it is clear that the criminal, has lost the ability to discern right from wrong therefore, they have relinquished their status as a human being and deserve to be slaughtered as animals. So in affect the two arguments are antithetical, conflicting and nullifying one another in such an obvious manner. How does a society that has established itself as the moral standard for the rest of the world, which esteems itself as the most civilized and advanced, still practice such a primitive, ineffective, obsolete means of crime prevention. Why does our country still at the dawn of a new century linger upon the ethical relic of an eye for an eye? It has been argued that the homicide rate has dramatically decreased since the reinstatement of capital punishment nation wide, yet there exist a plethora of external factors that could influence this decline. Would we rather believe that practiced barbarism is an effective way of instilling fear into the public, or that we as a people have matured, have grown and have become more civilized? It has been established that capital punishment is an inadequate means of crime prevention. Therefore what is the purpose of capital punishment? Does it exist as a means to gain personal retribution for the victims loved ones? Taking the life of another cannot possibly fill the void of the loss of a loved one, of a father, a wife, of a child. Capital Punishment should not be used as a tool of vengeance to punish murder with murder. The existence of the death penalty derails the purpose of our criminal justice system that exists to rehabilitate, not condemn. We must strive to find more humane ways to make these people repay their substantial debt to society, if in case reintegration is not a plausible option. We the people of the United States, have a direct obligation to uphold the highest of moral standings on every last facet of our society as we embark on a quest to usher less fortunate nations into the role of democracy, of liberty, of justice, and of freedom. We cannot afford to seem hypocritical in the eyes of our international peers. The United States should exemplify that rehabilitation, and repentance takes precedent over condemnation and death. Let us be a source of moral clarity for this earth, not a detriment to morality.  The very concept of capital punishment is in itself, morally redundant. It is true that one cannot seek to condone the reprehensible act of murder; it is a sordid affair, and perhaps the most deplorable action ever partaken by man, yet to punish a murderer by murder? There can be no gain in this. One could argue that by supporting Capital punishment we are aiding society by ridding it of its unwanted elements, and in effect improving the general welfare of the common man. In theory this concept has its appeal, in practice this concept had once before manifested itself in the history of mankind. It was known as the Holocaust. We are human, we must be humane lest we live as beasts acting purely on stimulus, propelled by the need for immediate gratification, constantly striking out in retaliation, abandoning the notion of preconception, of thought, of rational. Rationalization, after all this is all that separates humanity from the lesser beings, the ability to discern right from wrong, to take action whilst perceiving consequence. Where in case we might falter, our ingenuity has created a failsafe. It is known as Law. By incorporating this practice into the law of the land, we set an extremely nefarious precedent to the actual concept of law. Is the purpose of law, and the criminal justice system to preserve order, and stem the occurrence of vigilante like action, or does law exist to facilitate the concept of vengeful retribution? If so we have indeed created a fascinating paradox.  	I do not deem it necessary to continue refuting specious arguments, nor do I find it necessary to point out the multitude if reasons why capital punishment cannot be allowed to continue in The United States of America, or in the entire world. I trust that we acknowledge the struggle that our forefathers, the oppressed and disaffected of many a nation, who embarked on a perilous quest to establish a land free of the evils that they had left behind. A land that advocated three essential ideals. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I trust that we the people make the right decision and appose this immorality indivisibly as one nation, with liberty and justice for all.
