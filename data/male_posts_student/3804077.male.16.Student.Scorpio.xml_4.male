I look back into your eyes and realise that I'm weak and shouldn't be here.. But I am and theres nothing I can do to change that... I wanted everything to be simple but its not.. its all complicated and I have to deal with it..   Away from that subject, the company that was coming over did, and her kid aswell.. I'm waiting for something to happen, but it seems like its going to be like every other day.. shit... I'm going to get an mp3 player today and have all my mp3's burned to discs... Finally, right? I wonder what else I should do... nothing? Maybe we'll end up going to the movies, this way I know I did something today... I'll come back later and write some more.. -gone-
