While on the downtrodden path, the two mischeivous souls found a treasure map full of routes to take in order to reach the mysterious prize.  The boys decided, instead of following the map, to burn it and go to the local strip club.  This turned out to be a marvelous choice.  Tyke met up with Purdy McHot there and they went on a long romantic walk past Macaroon McGee's house.  They peeked in the window and saw a sight that they did not want to see.  It was Macaroon and Tyronius making out on McGee's loveseat.  So the two lovebirds, Tyke and Purdy, went back to Purdy's house, watched friends, and made out.
