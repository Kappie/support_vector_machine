And there are quite a few that i would liek to throw in my shredder....oh yes...and I do own a shredder...unlike the loser who claims he has a shredder waiting for the pictures..but really he doesn't even own a shredder...I on the other hand do have one...welp its off to band camp..................again..      ~Laterz~
