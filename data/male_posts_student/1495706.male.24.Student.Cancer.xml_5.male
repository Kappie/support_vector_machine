It's not like they don't have shit of their own to deal with, what with EU expansion and the challenges to its constitution by Basque and Catalan nationalists.  Plus they're still participating in your little War on Everybody- in Afghanistan.  Remember Afghanistan?  Probably not.  They didn't elect you.  Technically, nobody did.  So fuck you for thinking you have the right to dictate or criticize the choices of the Spanish people.  I try to rationalize your lies, to have fun with your obviously Hitlerian behavior (forcing countries to bow to his will was the start of something really messy- read a history book, ass).  But this is my limit.    I don't like you.  I hope you lose the election, though I know you won't because you have several important media ploys up your sleeve (troops back from Iraq, finding Osama, dropping gas prices because of your deal with Saudi Arabia) that stupid people will believe makes you great.    You're not.  Sincerely, A disgruntled voter who, coincidentally, UPS-ed a ballot from Spain in order to participate in the 2000 elections.  (Just in case- I love Bush.  Bush is God.)
