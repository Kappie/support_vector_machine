I was pleased with the concert thing, I didn't cock up once or get lost =D  I've just gotta somehow manage to drag myself through wednesday, thursday and the friday 1/2 day and I'm home free. I've been listening to alot of faith no more recently. I have a 2000 word essay in for Friday, coursework *sigh*  I don't have any plans for the Easter Holidays, I must make some. I don't have anything else to say, so have a good remainder of week everyone who reads this, oh and I'm in the new SikTh video, the crowd's blurry, but u can catch glimpses of Me, Dave, John and Ben, sweet. Cya fuckers. ^_^
