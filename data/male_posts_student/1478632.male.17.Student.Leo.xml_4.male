I checked out the stuff from the view of a computer on another resolution (the school computers have it locked on 1024x768), and I noticed that my posts section is...small. I tried to remedy this, but I don't have the patience to do that right now, so I'll do it on Tuesday during CAD class >:). Err...It's Friday, like I said before, and David is going to come up tonight, so maybe I'll get my puter back fomr the shop, which I have found, is where it  has been hiding since last Thursday. But, I'm a little bored. All week,I have been watching shows like  Silent Mobius  on  urlLink TechTv  and the  ScreenSavers , also on  urlLink TechTv , but the content has...stagnated. (*sigh*) This is getting to be a little annoying, working on such a slow computer, soooo cloooose to where mine was just eight days ago...I feel like I  need  to play Natural Selection! >.>  Ah well. Later.  --Clash
