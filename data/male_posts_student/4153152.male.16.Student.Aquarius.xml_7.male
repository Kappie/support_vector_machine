Due to my rage at Japanese carrier plane campers, we devised this tactic:   urlLink      I was on Axis at the time, with the 3 others being on the Allies. (This is Wake Island) I simply grounded the carrier, and left a truckload of targets for the other 3 guys. If you have never played Battlefield 1942 I highly recommend it. It's not for the simulation set, but it is a lot of fun and the online play is smooth, fast, and entertaining.
