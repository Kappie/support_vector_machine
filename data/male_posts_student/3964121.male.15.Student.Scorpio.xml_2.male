I, as some may know, work at a library. I shelve books all day. Now to some of you, it may seem like this is the perfect job for a fifteen year old. And it is a wonderful job. But for the amount that I do, I would rather stick pencils up people's noses (not necessarily mine). I am writing this post on my break and I have about five minutes left so I will make this as long as I am able to.  The library is usually one of my favorite places to go, but that was before I worked here, now I dread going. The library has become "work" to me, and everyone knows that the word "work" does not have a good background. Though I said I will make this as long as possible, I am gone now, for I am bored writing this. Do I have a problem with boredom? I don't know. The Protagonist is out.
