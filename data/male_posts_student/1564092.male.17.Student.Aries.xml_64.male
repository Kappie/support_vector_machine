You can look at them and know that a professional sure as heck didn't take them but at the same time you can get the over all affect of what went down I think. I was gonna make a book through iPhoto with them but they aren't nearly good enough and I can't touch them up enough to make me want to spend that much on a book. I need a digital camera so bad.. but I would much rather have a car.. hmm.. digital camera or a car?  Both!  heh
