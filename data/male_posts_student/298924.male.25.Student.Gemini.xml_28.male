The bootleggedness doesn't stop there.....the printer in the computer lab is out of toner....they gave a tour of the gross anatomy lab yesterday to some high school kids who looked like they had just come back from a Marilyn Manson concert....yeah that's just what these kids need to see....some dead bodies with their innards poking out....that'll set em straight!  Anyway enough of my complaining....  WARNING!!!....Football and sports are about to get their weekly due....if you don't care about sports hit back on your browser.....  Okay....My Falcons got drubbed by the lowly Bears....I'm sure Billy Cade was hitting backflips in Chapel Hill....I am hard pressed to think of a season that looked so bleak so early....all I can hope is that Mike Vick hangs in there and doesn't give up....The Dolphins resumed their winning ways by beating up on the New England Patriots....that almost gets the bad taste out of my mouth from the smackdown the Rams laid....Tennessee is in mourning right now because the Titans are 0-3 (indifferent is Killa Cal) and the 6th ranked Vols lost to the Georgia Bulldogs....I don't know how I feel about college football right now....I really thought Ga Tech had a legitimate shot at the national championship....Miami is my only hope right now.....let's hope the Seminoles don't find the game they lost in Chapel Hill....okay....the sports section is over....  In other news....I studied at Starbucks last night....had a Caramel Macchiotto....it was pretty good, but the coffee did a number on me when I went home and did my jogging....cramp city!....lesson learned, no coffee before running....Starbucks is a pretty cool place to study though, especially since there is no Barnes and Noble that I know of....  Apparently I am knee deep in an old school revival....I have pulled out the old trusty walkman and the tapes I made senior year of high school and freshman year of college....some of the highlights of this tape:  BBD (I Thought It Was Me?), Do Me, When Will I See You Smile Again, Always-Pebbles, Yours-Shai, and a host of George Benson songs....sandwiched by Gravediggaz, Mobb Deep, and Thug Luv by 2Pac and Bone....it gets no more random than that my friends.....  Oh well....enough for now....
