Currently Playing :  Jungle Boogie  by Kool and the Gang       Rambles : You know, since my time in CB, I have never felt so tired from doing P.E. Maybe some times back in UWC where you had to run around a proper athletic running thing (My mind is dead), but not since then have I tired. Thing is, I had a cough, so I felt crumby going into P.E xD But you know me, being the symbol of uprightness I am (in this case I uphold a reputation to stink at P.E, both physically and mentally xD).      On the upside, I’m going to be healthy this year.      On the downside, I’m going to be tired this year.      On the upside, I’m going to become diligent in all that I do, because of the intense training.       On the downside, I’m going to be tired this year.      Yes, I am truly a virtuoso when it comes to describing how I feel. I even use big words like virtuoso when I’m feeling in the dirt to make up for stuff xD      You know, I believe a person can only not be in love for a period of time before immediately seeking out a member of the opposite sex. For my readers Fudge and Alec, it is o-k if you seek out members of the same sex; I’m not going to make any comments. Well, I probably will, but you can ignore it xD      ANYWAY, this stems from the fact that even though you don’t have anybody special in your life, you try to seek love from things like your pets, your friends (your pet friends?), your sex-stimulating devices of both electronic and just-plastic nature, whatever. So, with this in mind, love is what powers us to do things from good to bad.      We seek friendship- GOOD      We seek sexual climaxes- Umm, really depends with what exactly. If it’s your pets, ummm, I think I’ll just skip this.     We seek… Ow, my fucking head is throbbing. And now that it is, we seek to cure pain. In doing this, we seek to gain love from both our body (You know, not like physical love, but love like “Hey, thanks mate, that headache fucking hurt, eh?” And no, I don’t have a Canadian/Australian brain, lord be thankful) and from others who may later suffer the same conditions. Like Christopher Reeves (That arse) who, only after becoming crippled, started donating funds to try and cure it. Because of his pain, others may be able to walk. Awwww     Anyway, my head is actually throbbing right now, so I may need to go off now, since I’m done with whatever homework I had.       Later on
