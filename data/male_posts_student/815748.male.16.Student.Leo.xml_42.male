I've made a list of 20 countries I'd want to be, sorted by importance so that if I don't get the most important, I can get the runner-up and if not that then the second runner-up and so on. I won't post the list to avoid manipulation and wheelings-and-dealings by other MUNers to prevent me from getting one of those nations.  I just finished reading and taking notes on "United Nations: The First Fifty Years," from which I learned much about the history of and strategy in the UN. I plan to apply methods therein to my sophomore MUN career.
