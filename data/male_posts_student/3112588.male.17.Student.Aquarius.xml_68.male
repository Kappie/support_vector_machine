YAY FOR NOAH! i was sooo happy when she only marked 5 wrong on my test..my heart was pounding. i actually had to go to the DMV twice b/c of lots of complications, but it all worked out for the best im sure. word of advice: dont go to the ghetto (hayward) to take your permit test...there are some scary folks there, and its just gross--but from what i hear, all DMV's are like that, so w/e. i just got back from seeing "The Bourne Supremacy" with my parents, suzy's family, and ruthie dyer tagged along. so funny: the theatre was like jam-packed, so our families didnt get to sit together...but suzy, ruthie, and myself found 3 seats in the 2nd row (closest i've ever sat to the screen) and grabbed them before they were taken! we all took off our shoes, and put our bare-feet over the chairs in the first row! it was lots of fun...except the guy next to me had to get up twice to go pee, so i had to keep standing up when he left and came back--weirdo! LoL when the movie was over, suzy and i had to go pee so bad...here was a line from "What About Bob?" we both quoted at the same time:" and, i'm afraid i won't be able to find a bathroom--and my bladder will explode!" LoL sooo many laughs tonight. "noah, you dont have to be the 'clap-daddy'" LoL..she didnt even say that, but thats what i thought she said. ruthie made some great jokes during the movie--and of course, YES--its ruthie, so you know she was knitting her famous cute scarves during the movie! haha luv ya ruthie...suzy and i went to starbucks before the movie started, and suzy told them her name was CECILIA. funny thing was, a woman whose real name was CECILIA ordered the same thing as suzy, so it was SO HILARIOUS trying to figure out who ordered what (b/c one of the carmel fraps was LIGHT)..LoL who would have though that she would actually pick the name of a woman who was actually there, AND get the same drink? good times, definitely. saw jeremy walker there, and of course--he raped me with his "man hugs". after that, we just came home. kinda just working through some stuff right now. not sure if i'll actually be staying home alone on saturday night. its still up in the air. but, pls call me reguardless, b/c i would love to talk to someone either way! well, i gotta get going. talking to katy right now, and yeah....need to do some shopping soon--laura, if you ever call me! byes
