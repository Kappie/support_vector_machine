LoL!! soooo funny. but yeah...so, we get to camp like really early (11:30am). we werent supposed to be there until like 2pm, but we decided to give them a surprise, and to try and beat all the 4th of July traffic! the funny thing was, as we're driving up there, we see jeremy's cooper's car in front of us, as we got off the Freedom Street exit! i kept honking tim's horn to try and get their attention, but then i second guessed myself: wow--jeremy's head isnt THAT big...but it was the same type of haircut. so finally, amanda pagan turns around in the back seat, and starts waving to me! we get to camp like 15 minutes later, b/c this person was driving like REALLY slow (we knew it couldnt have been jeremy), and amanda jumps out of the car all scared...then she goes: NOAH!??!!? little did they know, it was me and tim trying to get their attention! LoL! they thought were gonna like kill them or something..totally funny! it was tim driving, with scottie grant in the front seat, and amanda in the back! everyone comes out of their rooms to say hey and meet the 2 of us, and it was just tons of fun getting to know the new summer staff there! tim was having a good time. so, we go and get a little something to eat out of the ol' staff dining room, and then go and watched a movie in Brown (auditorium--Rush Hour 2). tim and i talked throughout like a little more then half of the movie...afterwards, we all piled into different cars to go to a party at Ian's house (one of scottie's friends)--all i can say is WOW...NEVER been to a "party" like that!! LoL! you guys who were there know what i mean ("Latoya"..i mean Tonya LoL!) we left the party, and headed back to camp. sarah carlson was making bracelets for everyone, and painting like everyones nails (even guys--flowers too haha), and i BEGGED her to make me one. and yes sarah! i promise i will NEVER take it off LoL!!! good times...we left for fireworks around like 6pm...me, tim, tim cooper, and jeremy cooper all piled into jeremy's "hoopty" (bringing it back into style haha), and drove to get some food at Carl's Jr! LoL "DRINK YOUR SODA!!" sarah wouldnt leave tim alone haha! "dude, i want to wait until i have my food, you lunatic!" haha very funny stuff! played around in the capitola mall parking lot for a while with the wind-throwing gun, and then headed out for some old fashioned good firework-watching! we couldnt find a spot anywhere within the ENTIRE place, which was completely ridiculous, so we had to illegally park in some hotel place so that we could watch them. we walked everywhere to find a bathroom and all thatgood stuff, and wound up finding a good place in the middle of the town to sit and watch (this all happened in Scotts Valley, btw)...so, the fireworks happen, and a bunch of ppl showed up--including Jesse..good to see her. piled back up in Jeremy's car again, and drove back to camp..hung out for a while, then tim and i decided to head home...we waited for a lot of the traffic to die down before we made the kinda-long trek home! we prayed before we left, and that was kind of reassuring to me, b/c i know that the Lord would protect us. since it was still dark when we left camp, it was kinda hard to see the road and everything, and the freeway back to San Jose was SO SLOW! omg everyone, it was the slowest traffic i've ever been in! sooo poor tim's foot is dying from the clutch and im about to like pass out or something (totally tired). he kept telling me to go to sleep and relax...so i did, for about 5 minutes. now, tims car had been making some weird sounds ever since we left camp, and that was quite disturbing, but i got over it...THAT IS, UNTIL THE DRIVESHAFT FELL OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE JEEP, and i started freaking out! dude, you guys....i've never shaken so much in my entire life...i was hyperventilating, and have major panic attacks. tim was just sitting there, calm--and thanking God that we were safe. i thought that i would have been the one to stay collected, but that changed. he reassured me that we were going to be fine....that is until 4 officers showed up behind us to check up on us. now, as you guys know...i wear contacts! they had been in for almost an entire day, and my eyes were totally bloodshot. thank God they didnt think we were drinking or high, but they waited with us until the AAA guy came to pick us up. when he got there, we were told that we could only get towed 5 miles...but we only had $26 bucks between the 2 of us, so he said: listen, im gonna do you 2 a favor, and tow you all the way to oakland for JUST $26 bucks. dude, this guy was an ANGEL! we were all the way in hayward, and usually that would cost about $150 bucks...but we got blessed. we got to his house, talked for hours, which was very good for us...we needed to talk--then we fell asleep LoL! my mom came to get me around like 12:30pm today, and i came home and took a nice 2.5 hour nap. just got back from shopping, where i got this freaking HOT jacket, and yeah...gtg though--byebye
