It's better than not spending it only to spend it sometime over the next two weeks on fast food. I haven't shown my parent my tattoo yet. I don't think I will. It's up high enough on my arm that even my smaller t-shirts cover it, so I shouldn't really have a problem with covering it up. Hm.  I want to say more. As is usually the case, I have tons to say, but can't seem to find the words. So I stay in silence. Good night.
