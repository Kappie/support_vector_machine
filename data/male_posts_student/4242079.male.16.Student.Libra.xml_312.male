I've been talking with a few different people about the feelings to harbour towards people who's blogs you read regularly, even if you have never met them in real life. If you don't hear from them for a few days, sometimes you get worried that maybe they have been in some horrible accident, or even perhaps that they are just sick. So why do we worry about our blogging peers?  I think the reason is because if you have read someone's blog regularly for any length of time, you probably know them better than people who have spent time with the person, but has not read the blog. This is due to the very personal nature of blogs, as many people write with little, or no inhibition that would normally keep them from letting the rest of the world know the true them.  A blog is a window.   In other news. Last night, I got on a bus with 250 other people, and rode it all the way to Edmonton. Sonja and Amber met me at the bar. It was good to see Sonja again.   ....i really thought I'd have more to say about that.
