And it’s a hug plus with the Nazis. C’mon, doesn’t that make a good movie? Alright, before the previews when we were sitting down, my brother and I somehow started talking about DMX’s song “X Gonna Give It to Ya.” I know, I don’t know why either, hehe. And at one point we talked about DMX on a Behind the Music type thing and they ask him “How did you write a song as beautiful as this, ‘X gonna give it to ya, he gonna give it to ya, X gonna give it to ya, he gonna give it to ya . . . ’” Funny shit, my friend. Okay back to Hellboy.  The movie was great. The guy who played Hellboy was great. Very funny, too! I really liked it. I mean, not much to say about the characters, but one character, “Kroenen,” this nonhuman-Nazi-who will kick your ass with style, was bitchin’! He was just, AWESOME! I mean, for a fake human/Nazi leader, he was pretty cool, hehe.  Well, I’m getting tired, may hit the sac. Anyways go see Hellboy. I mean, if you liked The Hulk, or Spider-Man, y’know, those movies, you’ll love Hellboy.   Remember to set your clocks 1 hour forward.
