I mean assigning a 200 point project on stuff you never taught us the week that an extra credit project is due, which we happen to have no choice but to do?  Halle's TV comp wasn't even that....  Um yeah so that sumarizes the mood I'm in.  yeah so lets go through my schedule and see what boring and dumb things I did today.   English - took the first part of the To Kill A Mockingbird test.  Boring. Homeroom - finnished my 8.1.04 drawing and conversed with al.  Not bad, but only 7 minutes  Bio - Mr G talked about monohybrid crosses.  I wasn't too tired today at least but... boring.  EASH - started the power point presentation, got mad at the stupid macs and the school for thinking i shouldn't be able to save, but all in all, finding constitution resources is, boring.  Lunch - As usual, boring, and todays lunch fishsticked.  ABS - Semi exciting, did a little 5 minute excel assignment, learned from the grade sheet that i'm getting an A, and then took care of a small termite problem with a hammer, flamethrower, machine gun, and a set of rubber stamps.  LOL  Gym - Also not bad, although after a few cartwheels and (attempted) handsprings my hand started hurting.  Geometry - Boring.  Review for the test tomorow.  German - Manlick was gone, class was canceled, so i cleaned out my german folder in study hall.  Boring.  Band - Learned from mr carroll that mary and reid are always, the first 2 people to come in, as I was the third today.  Other than that he stopped WAY too much on Mission Imposible and one of the other ones, but we finnally got to play Low Rider again so that was good.   So then, that makes 6 out of 9 hours boring.  what a great day. Anyway, I should go work on my Shrouds of Glory report, later everyone!
