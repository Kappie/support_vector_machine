Somewhat removed from modern life, I have a powerful ability to evoke wonder and show a sensitivity to nature as well as talents beyond what most people think of me.  Which work of art would  you  be?  urlLink The Art Test       As if the women in my life needed another reason to call me a neanderthal....this solidifies the point (if there was a point) made in my last post....  Oh well....grab beer, watch movie, call girl....ooga booga!
