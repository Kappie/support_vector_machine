I went back to school today, and things didn't seem to change a whole lot. wierd  I seriously think I'm going to bomb this damned social test. I haven't even finished the worksheets. fuck  You know, each coming weekend it feels like I have less and less to look forward to. I wish winter would go in a damned corner and leave me alone. Spring needs to come soon dammit.  "I came into life expecting nothing. I walked away possessing everything I never dreamed I would have."
