Now I see why: $2 for a handful of pita, falafel, lettuce, tomatoes, hummus, and delicious white sauce.  While in line, I overheard a seasoned customer give a fairly serious warning about the "ketchup" (the hot sauce is dispenced from red squeeze bottles) to an uninformed newbie. Still, I didn't expect the stuff to have such a kick and layered it on. Wow! How rare it is to find a fast food restaurant that caters to people who know ingesting anything with the label "hot" should result in moderate to extreme pain.  Even though I appreciate its existence, next time I think I will reduce my intake of the "ketchup" for reasons of personal safety.
