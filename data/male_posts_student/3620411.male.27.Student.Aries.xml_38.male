Plus the promotion is 10 baths per ride. Until the Aug. 12, 2004 or HM the queen's birthday. Ohh I was going to say that, now the train just start rolling. there is no ticketing machine. so we have to buy the token at the counter .. and they have to enter the value one by one which is very slow.               the pic is my mother :) urlLink     urlLink
