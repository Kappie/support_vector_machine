Basically, he played warhammer for 4 hours of straight, while I entertained myself on chat rooms posing with the handle "Dalek 69".  Basically, I was a robot sent from the future to pleasurize mothers. I managed to annoy the living hell out of the chat room, provoked some arguments, raised issues about incestuous threesomes. I OWNED this girl called HoNEY, who tried in vain to argue with me. Below is a chat transcript snippet:  --------------------------------  HoNEY: YOU HAVE NO LIFE YOU LOSER! YOU HAVE A 1 INCH COCK!  Dalek_69: Affirimative. I am a nonbeing. I have traveled across the galaxy with one unyielding purpose, to pleasurize your mommy. My apparatus is variable in length in order to cater for all sizes, races and shapes. My purpose is to ensure equality for undersized pussy, like yours.   HoNEY: YEAH YOR MOMMY WAS SITTING aND SPINNING ON YOUR DICK! YOU LOSER!!!1!  Dalek_69: I am sorry, but you seem mistaken, for I have no mother, I am a non being with the sole purpose to pleasurize your mommy. Affirmitive, it was indeed your mother who was sitting and rotating on my probe, I do believe it was the moment of your conception. ---------------------------------------  and so on and so forth. I also used the alias "Mr_Bonerific" in a gay men only chat. I regret doing that, I think the amount of pop ups for private conversations almost crashed Hansens comp.  We watched Kill Bill and 28 days later. Burnt some popcorn. Did more Delta Goodrem Shenanigans, professed my love to Avril Lavigne.  It's all good, I also got a good 3 hours of sleep! WOW!   Logging off now,  Colin
