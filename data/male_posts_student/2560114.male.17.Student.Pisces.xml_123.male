Then the dance begun...at first it was shakey cuz i was like "uh...all of these dances r the same, theyre overated" then as the night progressed i guess i had a fun time...so yeah...THNX ALICIA, LUV YA!!!!...yeah...then i had to go to the car wash today, which was also lame...in the beginning it was fun cuz i had music playin, and leonard, matt, adi, and i were all singin to some oldies, so it was bitchen. But then karla took the damn radio away so the whole time it was lame...without music, life is meaningless and not meant to b lived...seriously, thats how much i love music, without music i would probly go insane and start killin ppl...jk...ill probly b bored as hell...lata.
