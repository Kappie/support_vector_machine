Many of the action and special effects scenes got finished up. However, looking through them I see that we'll have to redo maybe 1/4 of the shots. Damn.  Tomorrow we'll do some work as well, doing mostly the tedious work where we need 4-5 people. I hope to have scene one wrapped up in 2 more shoots, but that will all be played by ear.  Here's a picture from my favorite shot we did today.   urlLink      It's a screenshot of the movie playing fullscreen, so the quality is bad.  I think I'll go work on some pottery, I'll be back.
