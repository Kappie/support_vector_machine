After reading the first two chapters I can honestly say this will definately be a life changer.  I encourage you to get the book, ha, and I haven't even finished it yet.  Thank God for a sunday school class who makes me buy these kind of things too, ya know.  Also, with Smite, we have to fill out the journal for each chapter.  After it is all said and done, I can look back at the progress I've made.  The very first sentence in the book is - It's not about you.  How true that was to me, I needed to hear that really bad! Let me know you're thoughts on my tagboard, let me know what you think of the book.  Thanks  The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will
