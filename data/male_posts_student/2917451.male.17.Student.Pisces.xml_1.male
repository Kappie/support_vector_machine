YOU`VE GOT TO STOP CARING!! instead, what you`ve got to do is to look forward to a great result, to all the congrats you`ll receive from others and to all the smiles you will bring to others because you did it. not because you  did very well , but just because you     did it .    you`ve just got to go out there and enjoy what you enjoy doing, do it, and leaves with a victorious smile.   that is all that matters. its that simple.
