The others of you, perhaps you use it as a daily reminder that nothing too tough can happen.  Or maybe you've heard it, but just think it's a big joke.  This is one of my favorite sayings.  I just received an e-mail from a friend of mine, and I came up with another use for this quote - in friendships.  I'm pretty sure that most of us at one time or another has been involved in a friendship that you thought was really great, but sometimes you had really bad fights or arguments... but you came out of those arguments even better friends than before, because you learned something from those arguments.  Or perhaps you've just lost touch with a friend over time or distance and got the chance to reconnect with them.  Well, that's my new use for that phrase - " what doesn't kill a friendship can only make it stronger ".  Sometimes it just seems that no matter what you do, a friendship is destined to be.  Sometimes friendships take some work, on both sides, but if it's meant to be - you will always be able to work through whatever problem(s) or issue(s) you have.  Or you will always find a way to reconnect to that "long lost friend".  And I'd say that nine times out of ten, that long lost person and you will have a stronger friendship for it down the road.   Challenge:    Call someone you haven't talked to in a while.  Someone you may have lost touch with.  Or just call a friend and let them know that you haven't forgotten them.  Or call a current friend and remind them that you care.
