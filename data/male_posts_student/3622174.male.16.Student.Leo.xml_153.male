Today I'll be talking about my yearbook mistake, and also the freshman orientation and my pre-thoughts about what's going to become the 2004-2005 school year.   Baseball Players...I'm Coming Back  Originally, my plan was to NOT come back to do baseball pictures for the 2005 baseball season. I really liked working with the team last year, but, I wasn't sure if I could handle the work again this coming season. So, I started telling the baseball players that I talk to that I wouldn't come back. Tonight, that has changed. I met Coach Lambdin, the new baseball coach (and my new English teacher), and we talked about how I did the pictures last season, and he said that he was definitely interested in doing something like that in the next season, but, we're taking it one step further. This year, along with the end of the year slideshow (which, ironically, has still not been given to the players from last year...major computer technical foul, but don't worry guys, you'll have them by the end of the month, depending on Mr. Weiner's quickness at getting them back to you guys), me and Lambdin talked about making a media guide, that would be a perfect tool for me to get into UCF, because we are going to do a photo credit, something that Coach Weiner last year did not have me do. We're going to play around with some ideas, and I might go tomorrow and start planning ahead, so that I'm not tapped as the official baseball photographer two hours before the first game of the season. This new coach is pretty cool, can't wait to start working with him, and hopefully the 2005 baseball season will be even better than this past year's.   My latest Yearbook Mistake  Oh yes, I've had another big yearbook mistake today...well, actually, yesterday, but I just found out about it today. When we were selling yearbooks, I guess I accidentally had some of the checks written for books and things in the wrong money bag, and that money bag had been put away in the back closet of the yearbook room. Well, Melissa, our advertising editor, was counting money, and discovered that there were several checks and cash missing. I looked at her, and I was like, "You've gotta be kidding me...how could that happen?" So, I started looking around, and before long, Mr. Myers, the principal, found out about it. THAT scared me, because I thought I was gonna get in HUGE trouble for it. Well, turns out, it was all hidden, and Adam found it. He found me and he was like "Ooh, you're in trouble with Mr. Myers..." I almost died right then and there. Then he was like "Oh, just kidding, we found them." I almost sunk. Oh well.   Freshmen...Eh, Uh Oh...  Well, I may have a problem with SOME of this year's freshmen class...they've got attitudes. Big attitudes. But, aside from that, they might be "alright," but, the attitudes with some of them need to change. If they even think about trying to run the school, they'd might as well get the f*** out, because I'll complain too much if they do. That goes for my brother, too. He messes with me, he should keep in mind that I know his locker combo (ironically, its the same as mine, just a different locker). Mwahahaha.  The 2004-2005 school year looks like it's going to be alright, with a couple flaws (stupid brother). Alot of the new teachers seem like they're going to be cool. Yearbook is going to be better this year. Tomorrow is the last official day of summer...let's hope this next school year goes well. That's it for tonight. I'm spent. 14 hours at the school today. That'll look good for my hours. Adios, until next time.
