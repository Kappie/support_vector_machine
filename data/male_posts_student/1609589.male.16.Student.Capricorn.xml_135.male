I'd turn it off, each time trying something different, until i decided to unplug it. Right when I unplugged it from the socket, the monitor flashed... but not white, it flashed something like a darker black... then the figure appeared... I was shocked more than scared.  Suddenly, I was on the sidewalk of a dark city street... none of the lights were on, and there were no cars about...  It's raining, but I'm not getting wet, nor do I hear the rain hitting the pavement, or any kind of wind or thunder.  I didn't have to wait very long before he showed up. He was on the other side of the street from me... The rain was bouncing off him, but he wasn't getting wet.   We just stood there for the longest time... Then, out of nowhere, a huge flash of light came from the sky, I ducked to cover, but I looked up at where the figure was, and he was gone. And, as I opened my eyes, my mom was standing sideways telling me to get up, And I got up so she wasn't standing on the wall anymore, and almost forgot the whole thing.   As I write this in school, I'm surprised that I remembered all of this. This was the most vivid dream I've had in a long time.
