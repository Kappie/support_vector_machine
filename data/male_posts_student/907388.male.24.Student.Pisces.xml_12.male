The question is simple   What is a better approach to life ? 1. Have a negative outlook, and always expect the worst. That way you will never be dissappointed. 2. Have a positive outlook, and expect the best. But you also risk being disappointed when things don't go your way.   This is not as simple as it looks at first sight. Think about this people,  and please mail me at maloy_mail@rediffmail.com and let me know.   And yes, CAT is only a week away. wish me luck all of you and PRAY FOR ME...
