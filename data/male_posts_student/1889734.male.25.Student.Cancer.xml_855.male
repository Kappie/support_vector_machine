The web is choking with summaries of Reagan’s life and accomplishments, and I’m sure you’ve had your fill of them this weekend.  Instead, I feel compelled to focus on what Reagan meant to me personally.  The news of his death isn’t really a surprise, and in many ways, it is a relief to know that the body has followed the mind, years late.  I can’t fathom the experience of the past decade for his family, and particularly for Mrs. Reagan.  It must be a particular form of hell to watch someone drift away from you in slow motion, knowing that he isn’t really in there anymore, yet the body still demands attention.  If there is a God, surely Reagan has been restored, and that’s a thought that fills me with some hope.  Early on Saturday morning, I read on Drudge that Reagan wasn’t likely to make it through the day (how does Drudge do it?).  I went on to my day of ASL, but my thoughts were already turning toward the 80s and what it meant for the nation and the world.  When I left ASL at 4 PM, the news had broke on the car radio, so I had another hour of drive time to really think about things as the fading AM station began a long, detailed summary of Reagan’s life, complete with sound bites.  In fact, there were so many quality pieces both on the radio and Fox News later; I suspect people had been quite busy getting this stuff together for quite some time.  I’m sure they have prepared packages for a lot of public figures…  My reactions in the car surprised me.  Like I had said, this wasn’t a surprise.  Yet I still felt waves of sadness, while at the same time, a fierce appreciation that a man like this had lived, and had risen to office precisely when the world needed him.  History has a way of producing the right men at the right time, introducing them to us at the very moment we most need whatever quality they bring along.  With Reagan, history provided.  Listening to portions of speeches, I was reminded of his strength and optimism, his warmth and resolve.  Here was a man who didn’t need nuance.  He knew what he saw, and labeled it as such, while at the same time not letting us forget that the root of his optimism came from us – we lifted him, and he simply pointed that out to us at a time when we couldn’t see it.  It is a testament to Reagan’s success that the very things he opposed have been demolished to such an extent it is easy to forget how threatening the times were.  The Soviet Union a memory, the Iron Curtain a quaint historical term, the Berlin Wall nothing more than a museum piece, and the malaise of the 1970s as something we scratch our heads over in bemusement.  Whether you wish to believe his policies accomplished all of these things is your personal choice, since many will refuse to credit him until their last breath.  I don’t need to defend him.  History will get it right, and Reagan’s stature will grow with each passing year while history places the events of his presidency in the bright light of critical examination.  I trust in the final verdict.  Personally, I despised Reagan while he was president.  It matters little, but that is something that fills me with shame – that I was too stupid and gullible to fully understand the very times I had the fortune to witness first hand.  I was a raging leftist, growing up on a steady diet of the mainstream media, wondering why America was supposed to be ‘great’ when we were so obviously flawed and corrupt.  I wondered how we had the audacity to impose our way of life on other cultures, and how, after Viet Nam, we could ever have the hubris to think our military was strong enough to stand against another armed power like the Soviet Union.  The Cold War was a misunderstanding, made worse by us and our pigheaded insistence that capitalism was so much better than communism.  In my mind, they were morally equivalent, and one was just as good as the other.  The gas lines of the 70s, and the interest rates and malaise were further indications that indeed our best days were behind us, and the best we could hope for was stasis.   What does it say when an eleven year old views the world this way?  I don’t recall my parent’s being very political back then.  It came from what I saw on TV, and what I read at school.  It came from a general sense of our culture.  For people our age, it is easy to forget how bad things were, since we were so young at the time.  Those slightly older have a clearer memory, and that clarity enhances the impact Reagan had when he assumed office.  He strode onto the stage, full of optimism and hope for a nation that had neither.  The elites hated him because he was obviously too stupid to understand the truth of where America was headed – who could be so hopeful in the face of such facts?  Through his presidency, he picked us up, dusted us off, and when we asked him where he found such reservoirs of optimism, he held up a mirror to our disbelieving faces.  Despite my hatred for him, a growing sense of respect had taken root in me, and when I felt that warm glow after one of his speeches; I chastised myself for ‘falling’ for his stagecraft.  It took me many years to get my thinking straight, long after he had left office.    The biggest moment in the Reagan presidency, for me, was the Summit at Reykjavik.  The Soviets handed us a bold proposal – a 50% reduction in warheads and the elimination of an entire class of nuclear missiles (intermediate range in Europe).  Imagine that.  It was a tremendous step toward disarmament, and any president would be pleased to take such an agreement home and present it to the congress.  Yet Reagan refused to give up SDI as a precondition.  He refused to place SDI on the block, knowing that he could not morally defend abandoning a defense program that might one day offer a better form of protection to the American people.  World reaction was uniformly negative.   urlLink Quote  - The press reported the Reykjavik "summit" as a failure. One U.S. congressman complained that Reagan had squandered "a chance to cash in 'Star Wars' for the best deal the Russians have offered us since they sold us Alaska." Others criticized Reagan for coming too close to an agreement with Gorbachev. "For a generation the security of the Western World has rested on nuclear deterrence," said James Schlesinger. "The American position at Reykjavik seems to have reflected no understanding of these simple fundamentals." Henry Kissinger warned that notions like the Zero Option undermined "the cohesion of the Western alliance." Indeed, America's NATO allies were mortified; they depended on a Western nuclear threat to defend Europe from the possibility of invasion by conventional Soviet forces.   In later years, Gorbachev said it was the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union.    The cynics, secure in their worldview that all that has happened was ‘inevitable’, easily dismiss his accomplishments as president.  I think that is further testament to his greatness.
