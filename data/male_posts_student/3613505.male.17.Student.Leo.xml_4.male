I'm a rather refreshingly witty individual and am under appreaciated -- hehe no really i'm serious. Tonight I am in a moody mood because i got stood up - yes - yours truly got stood up ... grr the nerve. It really sucks too you know because i was kinda looking forward to this for a while. We met through a mutual friend but we only talked online and over the phone a couple of times. Then today I was pretty hyped because you know we were gonna finally meet and WAM-BAM... stood up...  i called a couple of times but..... no answer. People are so very indecent these days, youd think someone would have the courtesy to CALL or i dunno make smoke signals or something.. fuck.. eww no i'm actually not angry just disappointed.  Ahh.. i bet this is just karma doing its thing. see.. a couple of weeks ago i went out with my lady friend and we were just hanging out doing whatever it is cool peoplelike us do on saturday nights.. haha ... so we ended up drinking a full bottle of wine... ahaha okay  I  ended up drinking most of the wine but w.e we were both pretty messed up... oh yah this happens when we leave her place to 'go to starbucks for some coffee' haha so we get back to her place all messed up... stumbling through her front doors waking up the whole neighbourhood (oh yah we bought pastries too...mmmmm) haha and we somehow keep straighfaces about the whole thing... even tho i can barely walk straight..... anyways there is OBVIOUS sexual tension between the both of us but neither one of us decide to act on it so w.e we're there watching some movie and then the next thing i know..... it's over haha it was really trippy... so by now it's like 1am and im all... 'uh oh... buses are about to stop running' so i go for the door and she pulls me back by the arm and plants a big wet one on me... haha i was so shocked i actually kissed her back and kinda grazed her arm - anyways she got shy and whatnot and she pretty much pushed me out the door -- haha so now you got me.... drunk and dazed about what just happened and i stumble my way to the bus stop.... im actually surprised i made it home...  well thats not the end of things...... yours truly is a bastard and for that i am sorry - i never called her back or did anything - we saw each other once more but i just wanted to get out of there.. it was like... you want me...... but im not attracted to you which is saad becaue she was such a close friend of mine.... well... she is..... just..... i havent talked to her in like a month.... hah shut up okay... i have problems with committment i think... was just talking about that with this good friend of mine and i decided that i'll only get involved in a relationship that i know right from the start isn't gonna work out... why do i do it? beats me... hmmm maybe it's some kind of genetical thing... blah.. who knows anyhoo maybe thats why i got stood up  it still sucks...  omg omg okay this morning i wrote my physics final and i am sooooooo happy... i actually got EVERYTHING -- haha it sounds so nerdy but you have no idea how much this physics teacher has suffered to try to get us stupid cretins to learn a few basic concepts and i got them all ( i think ) it was great -- only i was freeeeeeezing in that exam room.... hah the goosebumps were so noticeable this one guy started laughing at me... cha.. but thankfully thats over - after that i went over to the gym where i found out how weak i really am - i can't do ANYTHING... well thats a lie... i can do pretty much everything just really badly hehehe  well after that i bused home and who do i see on the bus - this girl i met a few months ago we just started chatting randomly on the bus and now were homies haha yeah im cool like that -- i was really happy to see her for some reason and its weird because i barely know her   and yeah then i got here and watched this crazy movie about a deprived lesbian hooker who goes out to kill all her clients it's called MONSTER and it's pretty good - during the movie a couple of my sister's friends came over and the dog was raping one of them... gawd hes such an embarrassment..i think i'll put him in obedience classes or something -- meh... then again hes the bestest little dog ever and so then  i raided the fridge and left for my 'hot date' - :*( haha serves me right... no no  it sucks ot be me right now...... ack and now im just tired and annoyed at all the studying im gonna have to do this weekend for that retarded bio final... eww -- i hate this  well i'll keep you posted on the ongoings of my very eventful life  OH YAH TOMORROW IS MY JOB INTERVIEW!! WISH ME LUCK!
