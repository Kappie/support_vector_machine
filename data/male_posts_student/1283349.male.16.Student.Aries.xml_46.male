Only this time It's permanent...not a visit. Ah well.  Pina Colada's are tasty and my mom makes good salsa.   And I'm bored. And sweaty. The pool's closed. But I'm planning on swimming all day tomorrow. It will be great. Same ol' crew from last summer. It's going to be hella fun.   Surprisingly there's not much to say. Well, you could all download a lovely song by an Australian band called Jester. The song is "Fries With That." Greeeeeat song...ah well...  -Manders What else is there to say?
