With no offense intended, and with all due respect for the situation -- swastikas on gravestones or bus and checkpoint bombings?  I'll take France.  Anyhow, President Jacques Chirac has  urlLink politely told Sharon to stay out of Paris , at least according to Israeli television. The exact words are a bit more blunt than usual for this kind of high-level diplomacy: "You are not welcome following your comments."  In other news, the US media has yet to fully pick up on the Allawi prisoner execution scandal.  urlLink Even Rush Limbaugh buys it . Your best bet is to follow that link and see Atrios' coverage -- I can't keep up with this story nearly fast enough.
