I was watching VH1 and they showed interviews of random people and they asked, "How would you like touring around the world as a musician?" and most of them answered they wished they could and it sounded like a lot of fun.  I laughed at that because I have heard what tours are like, and they suck.  Being in a band sucks.  The only reason you should be in a band is if you love making music....and i mean  love  it with a passion and if you do it for any other reason....you are insane.  Money.  Why does everyone believe that you become insanely rich as a musician?  You are actually very poor.  Using all your money to buy equipment.  Also, musicians have to benefits (ex: retirement benefits).  People think musicians are rich because they watch MTV and believe that is every band in the world right there.  There are actually thousands of bands dying everyday.  Getting on MTV is like winning the lottery.  You have a very few chance to get big, and when you do get big you have fans that don't want you to get big.  Which leads me to my next topic.  Fans.  Think about it.  Your life is in the hands of a obsessed teenage music fanatic, you just hope to god that they keep buying your cds .  Then when you do something wrong (ex: sell-out, change your style of music) they will flip out.  Hating you in an instant.  I do this not when a band sells-out, I hate a band I used to like when they change how they sound to make money.  I read in Ben Weasel's  Punk Is A Four-Letter Word  (great book everybody should read it) about on tours fans would chuck beer bottles at the band, and scream at them to play faster.  Which leads me to the next thing:  Tours.  Ah, yes.  The scenery.  The people.  The cities.  It all seems so glamorous.  Here is the truth:  1.Scenery:  The inside of a van, crammed with your other band mates and equipment, and every once in awhile stopping to sleep at a hotel.  2.The people: most likely assholes.  I don't just mean the fans.  Sometimes the people that you were supposed to play with don't even show up.  And sometimes the problem is a lack of people.  Nobody shows up.  And you play with no pay.  3.The cities:  You won't have time to see the cities and all the fun it has to offer.  It isn't a vacation, it's a job.  The good things about touring is seeing people really get into your music, and being in front of a large audience, and them liking it.  Oh, and as for being with your best friends for a couple weeks...it isn't fun.  By the end of the tour you will hate your bandmates no matter how good of friends you were.  But a little break from eachother usually fixes that.  As Ben Weasel once said, "Whenever somebody comes up to me talking about making a band, I say 'Don't do it.'"....or something like that....it was in his book.   (Note: I know I haven't experienced all of these things, I gathered this information thru many sources)
