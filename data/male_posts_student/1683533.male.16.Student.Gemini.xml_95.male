First off, the front cover is so great...I really like it (see it  urlLink here )  Basic political message...I like those...which leads into the next thing...  Politics...this cd has a strong view on each song...I think only 1 or 2 are not about the government...however...there is only so much songs you can write on the world...some songs to be the extremely similar...one thing is clear...the war and 9/11 hit these boys hard...  The sounds is pretty good, fast palm muting minor scale songs with more of a poppy type vocals...I think it would be better if there we some screaming hardcore type stuff...it would fit in more....  Some of the songs I particularly liked were "Yesterdays" (addicitive melodic intro...nice piano part in the middle...solid song), and I also liked "God Save the USA" (good lyrics...sometimes a little to broad...nice background vox)   It's a pretty good CD, I certainly don't regret buying it, but I get sort of the feeling they threw this CD together real fast...some songs sound similar thats all...   Overall Grade:  B-
