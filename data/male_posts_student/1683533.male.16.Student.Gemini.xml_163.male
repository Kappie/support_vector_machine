The cd is  Hot Damn!  and it sounds pretty good.  I got it at media play while I was preordering my copy of  Spider-Man 2  which I will get tomorrow.  I was watching the Daily Show and was delighted to see  Brandon from The Lawrence Arms  featured in one of the segments.  It was about right-wing punks and Brandon didnt believe in it.  I kinda agree with him, but they really made him look like a asshole which made me sad.  That's what the Daily Show is really good at, taking an issue, taking a side, and pummeling the otherside.  Oh well.   The Suffering  is actually a good game. I am almost half way done, because i was stuck and had to look at a walkthrough.  It is gory, and very thrilling.  The makers love  the Shining  and incorporated alot of things from the Shining into it.  You will constanlty see flashes of usually gruesome images and sometimes time slows down and you see something that isnt really there and it will act out something from the past to help you piece together what happened.  It's complicated but I suggest you check it out.  Ta ta for now.
