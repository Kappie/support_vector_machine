The fact that you may not live to see another day, that you could get into a car accident or get attached. Or if you'll ever find "the one", like your true love? I mean look at how many people are in this world, very few ever find "the one" in there life. That's why no body should ever take life for granted. You do life will pass you by, and your left wondering where it went. Never think that you like (or love) someone, and not give it a chance because of a mistake they've made. Because chances are if you do, you'll never run into some one like that again. That's why I think people who don't want to date because they've been hurt before, and they don't trust people because they're scared of being hurt are not very nice at all to say the least. You have to give people a chance because if you don't give people a chance, you take a chance at missing your(or there) chance at life and all the joys that go with it. People who don't want to date because they don't want to be hurt, it goes with the territory. Plus not everybody is going to break your heart. You have to give them a chance, its just not fair not to. That's cutting there life line before they've even tried to use it. Life is a giant chance don't hide yourself and miss yours. It will destroy you sooner or later. Yeah but that's my look one it, obviously you have your own look on it. So post a reply Id like to know what you think.
