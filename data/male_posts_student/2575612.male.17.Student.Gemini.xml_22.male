I think we have established that neither of us know how much.    scored the '99 grand prix today. a great car for sure. have so much running through my head. not sure how people deal with it. growing up, school, friends, boyfriends and girlfriends. juggling sports, club, and activities. life is so nuts.  *-missing you-*
