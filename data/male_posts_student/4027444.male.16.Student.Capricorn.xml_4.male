During this period I hope to make enough money to buy another digital camera, and an mp3 player... This means that (again) photography itself may take a back seat because I'm not sure about when me and my friends can head downtown (and I won't be sure untill Thursday afternoon). However, I will not despair because:   1. I will get some shooting done in those three weeks guaranteed, even if my plans for chillin' downtown with my friends fall through. I'm not exactly sure what I intend to shoot yet (I think I'll hit the cathedral first and do some more gothic stuff and then a bit of downtown central)...  2. I'M GOING ON VACATION: after those 3 weeks of work I'm heading out on vacation to (amongst others) Toronto and Montreal. By then I hope to have another digi-cam (so I don't have to borrow my mom's :D) and those are some REAL cities (with subways) where I hope to get alot of awesome shooting done.I'm also going to be kept busy with my work as a secretary, but hell: that's life... In any case, my exam is on Wednesday so I think I'll concentrate a bit on that and worry about the above later. TTFN.
