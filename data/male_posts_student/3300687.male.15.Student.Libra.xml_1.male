[is it because he knew i bought some snacks for him?]  5:30pm [After Playing With Him] After a few hours later, he started to get tired and he keeps on sleeping from 5.30pm to 10.20pm after constant playing with him for 2hours...  10.20pm [After His Nap] After that.. OMG! he begin to be very very active... he start to play with me but unfortunately, i've to study for my test.  10.30pm [To My Surprise] After a while, he went to shit.. To my surprise, he actually shit on the tray which i gave him as a toilet! [Can he be considered a toilet trained dog?] 11.00pm [Bye] Hehe.. Tts all... i have to stop here...
