If you  have control over your own life and it's not "predestined" (by god) then why does it some people question what will happen to them?    *change of subject* Sometimes I feel like I'm not pleas ing  friends (like making them happy or comfortable) in some kind of way. Most of the time I feel like I'm "wronging" my friends in some kind of way because, like sometimes my friends will be like mad at me for a reason I don't know why and it really irritates me.  I really like wanna have all my friends and not have any of my have have secrets or "unmentionables" like a certain "posse" that I know of. But still of my friends like have raging emotions and it feels like I'm stuck in the middle of it all and like they 're all just like not talking and I feel like I did something wrong and I need to find a way to fix it before our friendship breaks up or crumbles. But yeah I guess I'll go. leave a commnet if you want. ^_^
