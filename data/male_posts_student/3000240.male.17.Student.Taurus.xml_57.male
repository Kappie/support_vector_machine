Anyway I had a loooooong sociology conference at College and I'm getting more and more nervous about the match on Wednesday as the match ebbs ever closer *sigh*.  Also, you must agree the Weather is having one almighty period isn't it? God rain one minute, sunshine the next, what the hells next - snow with sun and tornados in the mix? xBuBzx
