I apologise to Miller about the post yesterday, on another glance what I said could have been interpreted as an insult, and I meant no such harm.  I'm still feeling depressed though.  Unfortunately, unless what I think may have happened in that the GYWO concert was brought forward a week, it'll clash with the Last Laugh in that they'll both be on the 11th. Alas!  Jon's single, and not liking it.  Quote of the day: "My life flows on in endless song, Above Earth's lamentation. I hear the real, though far off, hymn That hails a new creation."  From the traditional chant   My Life Flows On   Love, Jon Roskilly
