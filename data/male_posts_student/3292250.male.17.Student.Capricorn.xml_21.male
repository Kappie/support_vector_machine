I know that Kansas and Missouri are really humid too, but they don't always look at the 10 Day [Forecast] and sigh knowing that rain or scattered storms are on the horizon (the storms usually never being anything to even talk about with the cat). Is it so much to ask for a week of mostly sunny, 73 degree weather?  In other news, the Starbucks at the mall is coming along quite well and soon I'll be enjoying my (slightly) over-priced mocha by the waterfall.
