Secondly, I would like to note that right now I am listening to Feel by Zug Izland (go to my xanga to see the importance of that song). But yeah, I can't wait for Monday, going to Wet n Wild with the Joo. Maybe get to meet some new people. That would be cool. So yeah, I just wanted to pop in and update this mother, lol. I'll talk to you ALL soon. Bye
