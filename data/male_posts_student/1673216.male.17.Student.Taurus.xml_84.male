But we were sitting alone because our ride left already, so we tried doing something productive...It will be a cool song! Promise.   So..Accepted into Germany. I'm going. Semester. Around...5 months? Something like that. Waiting on my host family, and thus my placement. Pretty exited. Doncha know. So, Donnie will be gone for the whole first semester of his senior year. Oh dear.
