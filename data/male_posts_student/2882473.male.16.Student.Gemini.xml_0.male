After reading Deutsches's blog and hearing of this 'Dick and Dom in Da Bungalow' programme, I had to watch it, just to see if it was as bad as he had described. It was. Possibly one of the worst programmes I have ever seen. It features these two grown men fooling around in a badly constructed studio whilst getting all the child 'contestants' covered in muck and mess. I was only able to watch about 30 minutes of it - it was that awful. I can't see why any child would want to watch such rubbish.  Not only is that programme awful, there is another that caught my eye recently. Bernard's Watch. A few years ago, when I was young, I used to like this programme, and watched it almost every week. It featured a small boy, who has come into possession of a watch, which when a button is pressed on top, freezes time, letting him walk around in zero time. A farily original programme, with a narrator explaining the story, and the actors not saying too much. The story lines were often fairly good too. Then came the next series, introducing Bernard's little girl cousin, whom he shared the watch with. This was a drastic mistake in my opinion, sharing the watch was a bad idea, but it was still just about watchable. Then came the most recent series, the first episode of which I saw only a few weeks ago. Not only has this got a different child playing the part of Bernard - they really should have kept the original, or ended it completely, but they have done away with the Narrator. HOW COULD THEY DO THAT?!?!?! Also, they have added a crappy special effect, showing some sort of energy pulse emited from the watch as the button is pressed. Finally, they have changed the parents, who now are just total idiots. Why did they have to ruin the series? It USED TO BE GOOD I TELL YOU!!! This site shows the original cast (it was better in the first series, without his cousin) http://www.whom.co.uk/whom/bswatch.htm  These are not the only programmes that have gone downhill, a lot of programmes now on are no way near as good as the ones I used to watch.
