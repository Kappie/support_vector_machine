God, when I meet this woman that You are preparing me for, please allow her to fit almost seamlessly into my life.  Please give me the strength to be my own person, and allow me the knowledge I need to combine my "worlds".  Also, please remind me to not forget about my other friends and hurt people as many have done to me in the past, present, and I'm sure will happen again in the future. Grant me peace in knowing that one day I'll meet her, and that it will be a joy for You to see two of Your children bonded on a deep level.  Thank You for this day, and for all the blessings in my life, especially those that I may not recognize and take for granted.  Your loving servant, Scott.
