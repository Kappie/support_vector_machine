I'm not sad all the time. But i never have a day that i'm good with me. Sometimes i wish i could dessepear, and unfortunetly i have no way out. I feel that i'm alone, that i haven't got anyfriends or just someone to tell about what happenned to me (this i know that doesn't happen to me only, I've heard other people saying the same, but it always feel that it's worse with ourselves). And the only person i can do those stuff, can't log in and i guess, is mad at me. Well, it's just a question of time, maybe.
