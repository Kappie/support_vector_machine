We play tomorrow in Sulphur Springs @ 7:30 PM, but the but leaves at 3:00. That means I have to be up at the school between 2:15 and 2:30 to get everything ready. This sounds like I might be the only student trainer at the game tomorrow...  If Wes is no longer going to be the Varsity trainer (and I'm therefore the only one), it'll be interesting to see how games after this week are handled. If we win this series, we'll have games on days that I'm in summer school. Games that are after 1:10 (or that I have to leave for after that time) won't be a problem, but I don't know how State will work if we go that far since I doubt I can miss (at least) 2 days of summer school to go to wherever those games will be played. Oh well, I guess we'll just see how it works out.
