What she's doing is just leeching money and shit if she really loves him no more.  I don't hate her, but her plans of leaving aren't thought out at all.  She knows not what she wants or where she will go.  Guh, I'm so confused.  Franz, I'm sorry for any and all shit I gave you when this happened to you.
