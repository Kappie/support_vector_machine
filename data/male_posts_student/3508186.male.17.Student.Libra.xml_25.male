So I woke up, ate some cereal and was sitting in the livingroom and she came in asking if I were ready to go. Of course I was like "I dont wanna go" cause she just wanted to get something real quick and that to me is boring. So she gets up all pissed and tells me I cant go out for the rest of the time we're here which is like a whole week. I got up all pissed and was like. "Whatever, I'm not listening to you!"  So, like many of our other fights go down she starts yellin about me going back to Montana. She is so damn lazy and selfish it's rediculous. She makes Justin and I do stuff for her that is totally stupid. Yesterday she had me get the lawn chair outta the trunk of her car for her, only to bitch at me for not setting it up when she was right there and could do it herself. To me that is laziness at its best. Well, back to the subject, she starts tellin me that I need to call dad and that she cant take it another year ...blah blah blah....I dont really fucking care anymore. She has threatened me so much with that, uuhhhh, I fuckin hate it. So she left for Muskogee by herself. Before hand she was sayin we get into fights every other conversation we have. Now that's an over-exaggeration, we havnt gotten into a fight all summer. She is full of crap it burns her eyes. Well, I'm sick of this writing crap, peace.
