But if it had to perish twice,  I think I know enough of hate  To know that for destruction ice  Is also great  And would suffice.     Food of the Day : Cheese Cubes    Fact of the Day : Häagen-Dazs is not German, it’s American. The founder of the company, Reuben Mattus, started it all in, where else but New York, America. Reason I mention this is because it’s a common held belief that because of its name, it’s German, and even some of the people who work for it think the same. You learn something new every day don’t you?     Rambles : Today was average. I awoke at eleven, and went to a party at around 3:30-4:00 pm. A pool party. Which means? Ding ding ding! BIKINIS… Hahaha, of course, that’s the only reason I went. No, not really, it’s because I felt bad for not going to the after party on prom night. Well, it meant I got to hang around with people, so that’s good. Now, an excerpt from a conversation with my friend Christina, though it’s not word-for-word.    Her : When you’re a kid your idea of flirting is picking and playfully hitting a girl.   Me : *lightly punches her leg and giggles* That’s not how we flirt anymore?   Yes, call me juvenile. I like to enjoy small jokes like that. I wish flirting was so easy now, i'd be the king. Not that i'm not right now... Err, piss off...
