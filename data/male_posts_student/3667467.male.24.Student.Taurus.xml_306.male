One of Jeff's containers of Pillsbury bread dough was ceremoniously dumped into the trash. Though still in good health, we realized that it had been stuck fast to the bottom of the fridge by an unknown organic substance. Rather than try to salvage the can and risk irreparable damage we let nature take its course. The dough is survived by several pots, and assortment of blue and yellow plastic plates, and a lone jar of Country Time Lemonade Mix (TM) ("Mix w/vodka and enjoy!").
