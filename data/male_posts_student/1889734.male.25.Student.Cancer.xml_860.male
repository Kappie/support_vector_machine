Since I've been such a harsh critic of Islam for not denouncing the state of their faith, it is especially important that I post these when I can find them.    Excerpt - "Because of the decentralized nature of Islam, al-Shehry's essay doesn't equate to Martin Luther's theses nailed to the church door, but it does infer that the Saudi government may be rethinking radical Wahhabi philosophy in light of its targeting by radical Islamists. "  Encouraging news.
