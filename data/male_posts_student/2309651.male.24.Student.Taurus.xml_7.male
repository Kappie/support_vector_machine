Today Wolfowitz testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee where he faced a barrage of question, mainly attacking his credulity.  Even affable Senator Russ Feingold questioned his integrity, saying that senators had asked before the war about plans for securing weapons of mass destruction and dealing with a possible negative response from the Iraqi people.  "I, frankly, feel we were never given real answers to that, and I have a feeling that it's because there wasn't a serious plan, and I think at this point we're paying a serious price for it," Feingold said.   Wolfowitz responded, while the plan wasn't perfect, there was a serious plan in place.  It is my perception that in this highly charged election year atmosphere, critics to the war expect nothing short of perfection when handling Iraq.  One's response to this would be "Well, when you are dealing with American lives, It should be perfect or close to it".  This may be true, a war plan should be perfect, but realistically this is impossible.  Our Iraq war plan took into account the acceptance of the Iraqi people, and I am going to go out on a limb and say that we have garnered this acceptance even throughout the prisoner scandal and what not.  What our war plan did not take into account was the little read AP wire piece written in April 2003--shortly after the liberation of Baghdad--in which Al Qaida called on all "friends of Islam" to descend upon Iraq and take up arms.  No one really paid much attention in April, but six months later people took heed.  The point is that the roadside bombings of American troops, the terrorist attacks on Iraqi civilians, and the other various things that have gone on in Iraq have been perpetrated by mostly non-Iraqis in the hopes of disrupting what would be a peaceful transfer of power on June 30.  So when Senator Feingold claims that Wolfowitz was not right about the acceptance of the Iraqi people, he is wrong.  He should modify his statement to say that we have not yet garnered the acceptance of the Syrian militias or the Iranian militias, who do not want to see democracy take hold in the middle east.    The resolve of President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld, and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz in maintaining that deadline should be commended.  Terrorist will not dictate the pursuit of democracy.  As well as, politicians should not bicker about their perceptions of Wolfowitz's perceptions of a war plan that has not come to its full fruition yet.  Mistakes have been made, but June 30 has yet to pass.  Democracy will come to Iraq, but even in this age of attention deficit disorder, we must have patience...
