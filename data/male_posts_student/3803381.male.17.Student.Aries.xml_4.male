I said "no" to watching a movie that flew in the face of everything I believe. I didn't think it was going to be a hard thing to do. I was wrong. It was very hard. I had to explain to my teacher that I couldn't watch the movie. That really doesn't sound like a hard thing to do, but to bring myself to walk up to her and say, "I just wanted to let you know that I will not be watching the movie this morning" took more courage than I've everneeded to use before. Do you "use" courage? I don't know. But I couldn't think of a better word. She asked me why not, and I eplained to her that my moral standards do not allow me to watch a movie that contains any nudity or sex. And this movie did. By the way, the movie is called "The Cider House Rules". You can find a review on it  urlLink here , but why evenbother? It's a pro-abortion, pro-incest, pro-fornication movie. I was highly disappointed to learn that Tobey Maguire has a lead role in it. Hollywood is a wreck.That's all for now.   RcYoAxN
