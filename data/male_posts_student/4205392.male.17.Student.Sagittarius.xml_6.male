Of import are Salt Lake City, spawning ground of Mormons, SCO, and Orrin Hatch (all of whom I despise with a passion), Yellowstone (outdoors), and South Dakota (somewhat smelly according to the Simpsons). Although it seems as if I'm very reluctant to go on this trip, I'm actually quite excited. Originally, I thought that I would have to spend hours outdoors, communing with nature to the point where I would be able to understand why earthquakes were slowly breaking apart Northrend, but instead, I get to meet the enemy (trees, everything in Utah, Holiday Inn) FACE TO FACE. So, for the ones of readers out there, don't despair! I'll be back in a week, probably with a rapid flurry of posts and/or pictures. Tally ho!
