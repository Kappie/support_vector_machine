How it worked out I don't know, because I had to rush to Forest Park Methodist halfway through to get to the Icthus Concert meeting. I know it is two weeks away, but I'm still pumped! Icthus! Icthus! Icthus! Woo! After THAT, I took it easy and went shopping for random camping/Icthus stuff with me mum (a bit of the British that isn't in me). We ended up buying plenty of gear including a backpacker tent, a floor mat for my sleeping bag, a decent waterbottle, some of those cool orange slices that are really huge sugar-coated jelly beans! SUGAR!!!  At the Icthus meeting, I was asked which band is my favorite. That is quite difficult for me as I listen to a wide range of Christian rock from lighter tones like Stephen Curtis Chapman all the way up to angst music such as P.O.D and like certain songs from each band equally. It all depends on which I feel like at the time. I like death-rattling headsmacking rhythms today, but may enjoy that soothing hippy love later. I ended up saying Kutlass, because it's near the middle of the rock spectrum (though some would say otherwise) and my interests hit it often as I move up and down the scale.
