I'm not sure exactly when I've picked up such a strong conviction and belief in loyalty. Usually I can trace back my personality aspects or flaws to some occurence in the past.  This however, is a mystery.  I can't figure out for the life of me where this one comes from.  Loyalty is perhaps one of the only things i'm extremely emotional about. Just thinking about the past year..there were a few instances within a group i was involved in since I came to ESU where i trusted all of the members with something...which was supposed to be kept between us due to bonds of brotherhood.  On more than one occasion members saw fit to break that loyalty and it affected my life.  Later, that caused me to doubt my own loyalty to the organization and ultimately leave it. I guess from that example i gathered 2 things: 1.I'm only as loyal to someone or something to the same degree of loyalty they have to me 2.A break in that loyalty eventutally causes me to react to it  I think that maybe loyalty is a big factor to me because i'm a skeptical person about this world and really i'd rather have a loyal group of people i can confide in and trust in with my life, rather than have 5million friends and be prom king. Loyalty is a big issue in the mafia...like goodfellas..never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut..theyre words to live by. If a mafia style culture ruled all of this world, trust wouldnt be an issue, respect wouldnt be non existant, and loyalty would be a watchword for all of us.  Now..if youre reading this and wondering why i wrote this and what its supposed to mean...i guess you should think about it this way... when no one else was there, when no one else had the answers, when everyone else was too busy to care, there are people you turn to for help...and they gave it..without motives or anything...you trusted them and they kept whatever it was safe....in my mind..to them you owe your word..you owe respect..your payment is loyalty(but not EVERYONE deserves it)..its something hard to find in this fucked up world..its not something you can buy...Its some kind of security in this ever changing, cold society we live in.  Boys and girls, Loyalty is my safety net and what gets ME through it all. What about you?
