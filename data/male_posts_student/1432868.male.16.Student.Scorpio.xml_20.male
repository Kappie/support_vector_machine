No man is an island, and there are an ifinite number of points in the universe.  You're just a point, stuck next to other points for the rest of your life.  So don't war with them.  Our points will change, expand, and fade to match the changes in our lives.  But we are still points, remember that.  We are still connected by a thread of other points, and there's nothing to be done about it.  Sadly, one can't help but live geometry.  Happily, life doesn't have to suck as much as the class....  Life is what you make of it.  You are what you make yourself....In some ways we are islands.  But even islands enjoy connectedness--to oceans.  Islands need oceans, because without them they would no longer be islands.  So you need others.... yes that was the pep talk for the day.  i am now thoroughly disgusted.
