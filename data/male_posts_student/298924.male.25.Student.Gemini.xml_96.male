So I just got back from the SNMA convention in Houston, TX.  Soooo much went on.  Firstly I didn't do any of the things I was supposed to do.  Go to meetings??....Blah?....How can you go to meetings when there is a Brooks Brothers right downstairs?.....However I did have too much fun....more fun than the law allows (literally).  First day....man oh man....get to the airport at around 7:15 and wait till 8 for the bar to open....me and Geoff each had 4 drinks (mine was scotch and tonic) and we were also joined by our classmate Amanda....we arrive around 11 in the morning and me, Geoff, and Dave ride out with their linebrother Dave....(yeah two Daves)....we roll out to the university of Houston.....this school was something completely different to me....from my very limited view it seemed kinda cool but it was very, very different.....then we decide to take it to the other TSU (which by the way will never be refered to as TSU by me from this point forward....)....Texas Southern is the perfect school for you if you always wanted to be greek but aren't so sure about the Divine Nine....it seems that the black folks at THIS school have taken every conceivable three letter combination of Greek letters and formed a group....are you dark skin with nappy hair and face only a mother could love but you still want to twirl a cane???....join ramdom organization A!!!....yes at Texas Southern noone is a nobody!!....Then we make our way to a place that served Empanada's (also known as Oompaloompas....).....these balls of fried tortillas with chicken inside were the greatest.....Michelina's needs to begin work post stat on creating a microwave version for my enjoyment....  So we get to the hotel....the Westin Galleria....at this point I would like to congratulate the genius who decided to connect a hotel with a mall....what a great effing idea!!!....I then proceded to go wild inside of what is probably the most ballingest mall I have ever entered....Lenox and Phipps have nothing on the Galleria....oh and I did see Kelly from Destiny's Child in Gucci not to mention....that and I discovered that there is a LaCoste boutique!!....went to a meeting led by some chick who probably should have been a kindergarten teacher but somehow found her way into someone's med school....at this point I am tired and head into the mall again (this happened about 90 times during the next three days)....then we got ready for the night's festivities...  The Hard Rock Cafe was the spot for the night....prior to leaving however, it is the custom to get "liquored up".....because we were in Houston we decided to go all out!....the Super Magnum of Grey Goose and two huge bottles of Apple Puckers were purchased....drinks were tossed up all around (not to mention there was weed)....by the way.....our room consisted of me, Geoff, Dave, and Mark (this is key later on)....so after a suffiecient period of drinking and smoking we head out to the Hard Rock....I had a blast....I saw one person I was expecting to see (Renita) and one I didn't expect to see (Charmaine) and I was pleased on both counts....after hanging for a while we decided it was time to leave....but we couldn't find Mark....and well since me and the other three were all in some various form of intoxication Mark didn't make it into the car with us (which in hindsight was probably a good thing)....so off we head to Taco Cabana cuz aggin's are hungry....but Houston Dave kept giving Meharry Dave bad directions such as:  "Whenever I tell you to turn make a left" (while pointing right) and while on the freeway (yeah you can get off at anyone of these exits)....anyway we somehow ended up in a Denny's parking lot where Houston Dave says, "My house is around the corner.....I'm finna piss the dog and I'll be right back"....yes that's right this man did say he had to "Piss the Dog"....now if any of us had been sober we wouldn't have gotten out of the car.....we would have in fact headed to the hotel....but we were not....and as a result we were "out there bad"....we ended up taking a cab back from Denny's after finding out were probably in the neighborhood Jason's Lyric was filmed in....not good times....bad times....we make it back to the room expecting to not see Mark...not only do we see this fool....we see him posted up on the floor in the bathroom with one hand on the rim of the toilet looking up with a blank look....and despite the fact that we all needed to urinate "The Dude" would not leave his post....Geoff laughs for an hour and we all head to sleep....  Day two....we wake up the next morning and the Dude has changed positions....he is now sleeping with his upper torso in the closet and his lower body in the hallway....we all had to step over, around, and even on him to iron our clothes and anter the bathroom....we get dressed and decide to call "Piss the Dog" and see what the hell happened last night....dude didn't remember having left us at all....he said he woke up and his front door was open and he was basically out there bad just like us....we had a few good laughs about this and then I decided to go pay my friend Renita a visit....we caught up for a long time and even went into the mall (I got a LaCoste Cologne and got on the mailing list along with a cd or two)....went to a meeting and discovered how obsolete I really was.....turns out that our region feels like our school has too much voting power even though we have over half of the membership in the region and control 85% of the funds.....long story short they gave our school only one vote and left the other delegates high and dry.....at this point most of us said eff the conference and it became about having as much fun as possible....  We then head to a party at a place called "The Mansion"...."Piss the Dog" had never heard of the Mansion so we were apprehensive at first....turns out that this place might have been the best club I've ever had the pleasure of entering....it was laid out like a Mexican Hacienda with various outdoor patios and plush upstairs areas with couches....it had beds in the main room and it was just the greatest....it combined the best parts of 112, Vegas Nights, and Karma all in one club with the atmosphere of the Industry and crowds as good as the old Phenomena(if you aren't familiar with Atlanta clubs none of this will mean anything to you)....in short this was the best party ever....beating out the imfamous 2000 Senior Party at the Chili Pepper....yes it was that great....we headed to Taco Cabana and then called it a night....  The next day my boy Bernard was having a barbeque so initially the whole crew was supposed to roll out that way....Dave still had alot more weed so he wanted to make some brownies and we also still had some shopping we wanted to do....I went and got some Air Huaraches (Dark grey/light grey)....then Amanda made her way up from Louisiana with her cousin and best friend....we end up heading out to this mexican restuarant which was nowhere near as good as the first one we visited and then I headed back to the hotel so that Eulus could come get me and whoever to go to Bernard's....Whoever ended up going from about 4 people to just me and Heather....Bernard had just pledged Omega so he had some of his LB's over....they were cool but after a while I was ready to go.....2 hours after a while had passed I was finally able to leave and we headed back to the Hotel....I didn't really want to do anything at all when I got back to the hotel....Heather and I had gotten a half gallon of Absolute and it would have been fine by me to have a little room party and call it a night....I happened to run into Charmaine again and I REALLY wanted to kick it with her because I hadn't gotten a chance to even so much as dance with her and she was looking GOOD....but at any rate I headed out with the fellas and we ended up going to a place called Semper's which I didn't remember very well because of the brownies.....  Which leads to today....somehow I packed all of my stuff and didn't leave anything in Houston....I saw Charmaine again this morning at the airport but I was just too tired/high/plain ole out of it to even go sit with her....luckily for me I was able to get her number so I plan to call her for certain....the flight was okay (kinda bumpy) and I've been asleep ever since....  I am glad I have tomorrow off because I will need it....what a weekend!!
