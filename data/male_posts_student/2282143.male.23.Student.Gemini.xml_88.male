And I feel like being productive today for some odd reason.  Im glad my little brother finally saw the light.  He was getting REALLY pissed off by Dubya.  Like, it was affecting how he was living.  He realized yeah, you gotta fight the power, but that doesnt mean you have to give up living your life the way you want to.  I think he was getting a little too into politics and lost sight on what is really important: life.  I mean, politics are just so corrupt and evil, its not even funny.  And its our own damn faults.  We train others to blow us up.  Good call guys.  So it bites us in the ass, innocents die, and the fat cats keep getting fatter.  But the average person wont do a damn thing to stop the cycle.  The smart ones try, but their cries are drowned out by the drooling babble of the inept.  I hate to say it, but its kind of an endless cycle that will ultimately lead to the destruction of America and possibly a revolution.  When I look back at it, I think 9/11 should have been a HUGE wake up call to everyone, but it wasnt.  It only made matters worse.  It told all of us that we are the best, and no one can fuck with us, everyone else is wrong, and we should just keep spreading our way of life like the virus it is.  Instead of enlightenment, we spread napalm.  Dammit, now Im getting all mad.  Ok, Im gonna stop now before I join some crazy ass political movement.  Regardless, just live your life, fight the power, but dont forget that life does come first and you should try and enjoy it as much as possible.  Yup.  Oh yeah, zoo party at Ledo's was a bit out of control.  Played Galaga with Sue.  She is pretty damn good at it.  Funny cause she is about 15ish years older than me and she said it reminded her of when she was a teen.  Just funny in my mind.  Whatever.  Zoo called, Im going in later today.  Rock.
