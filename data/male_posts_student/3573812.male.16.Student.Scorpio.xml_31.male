Actually, it's not the world that I'm fucked off with. That would be too easy. I'm fucked off withme and my continual existence.   Why?! No that wasn't a rhetorical question. Tell me why. Why?!   I can't deal, and even if I could, would I want to? Why must my thoughts and feelings be so conflicting? They're all flying in from opposite directions and collision is inevitable. Will it kill me? Who knows? Or better yet, who cares? And by who I mean me. Do I care? At the moment, no.
