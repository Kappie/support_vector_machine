It is so strange cause in 20th years before it never happened to me.  I never wanted to be the first but second, I was at least second if I wasn’t fist.  Now things have been changed. I am nothing. I waste my time away for doing nothing.  I have to do something. I have to change a lot of things. I am far far behind of what I should be. I have to be quick, very quick.  I know what happened now, and I will change those things have went wrong. I am going to get back to the game. And this time I’m definitely going to win.   So I’m telling you, who wants to stop me: You may slow me down for a while but I’m back again, stronger than before. So  fear  of me, because this is  fear  that keeps you in the safe distance from me.
