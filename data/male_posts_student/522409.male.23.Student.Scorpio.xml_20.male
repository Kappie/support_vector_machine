One more drink and I'll move on." --DMB "Grace is Gone"  The tricks your heart plays on you when all you need to hear is "I'm over her this time."   So it tells you what you want to hear.  Then it drops the truth on you all at once.  Fuck.  Same old situation, same cast of characters.  You'd think at some point it'd get old.  Game on.
