Today was probably the most funniest yet scariest (drum solo) day of my life. In AP Euro, Jared Liggin sits in a desk which completely collapses on him. It was right in the beginning of the period before the 2nd bell rang and nobody really saw the whole thing but me. It was amazing, he went down slowly and was like "aaah" in a really calm relaxed voice. Then he was on the ground smiling with all lady teachers asking if he was ok. It was probably Mr. Ferrante (our AP Euro teacher) who took the bolts out and wasn't in class that day. I had a shitload of tests today but over the weekend...no homework! YEA! After school I watched Weird Science with Paul. Then Heaton, Paul and I went to Smithtown Idol hoping to laugh at all the people but they were too good to laugh at. Heaton and I got bored so we went to the back of the auditorium and ran up and down the stairs. Now Heaton's sleeping over and we're gonna watch The Matrix Reloaded again. All night Heaton and I have been saying "stack em to the heavens" and "what more could they want!" That was hilarious, that and...seeing Red Dragon half way through having no clue what the hell it's about, and all the sudden seeing an old man fly down a road in a wheel chair completely engulfed in flames. I haven't seen Heaton laugh that hard before. He was on the ground laughing. Ah yes, Bin Bin Chi = BBC! LATEX.
