I've missed Firefox for so long.  The only reason I switched in the first place was because most multimedia sites didn't support it.  But now, I don't care.  Firefox is my web browser!  The just released the .9 version.  I am very pleased with it (the interface has suffered, though, I will have to go back to the original skin...).   mozilla.org  Until next time:  It's 11:45, do you know where your children are?  Love, Jesse
