Well, maybe the second worst job...no toilets were involved. However, I couldn't help but think, is this where my college degree will get me? A job that could be performed by a chimp with an average IQ and minimal training?  *An afternoon of the usual blah errands, followed by dinner followed by (what else?) an attempt to watch one of my West Wing DVDs, which proved to be really boring. You know there has to be a problem when the West Wing seems boring to me...what's going on?  *Drinks with my friend Paul at the Dog and Duck (and hence the title of this post). I didn't drink much, but it seemed to work quickly and effectively (hence the rambling nature of my writing). Paul and I talked  urlLink politics  and life in general here at the English dept, which leads me to my final question:  Should I leave the program after I get my Master's degree, move to an interesting  urlLink city  and live a couple of years in exile before I complete my education (probably by going to law school)? Or should I stick with the security of a monthly income and benefits for the next few years to finish my Ph.D.? Which will get me closer to my ultimate career  urlLink goal ? Should I wait and see who gets  urlLink elected  on November 2nd before I decide? What do you think?  Finally, tomorrow my friend Allyn is coming into town for an Ari Hest concert at Stubb's. I'm thrilled! Allyn is the funniest person I know! If your plane has to make an emergency landing in Bangor, Maine, there's no one you would rather be sitting next to. Trust me. Look for pictures tomorrow...
