I mean, how long does it take to verify that yes, all these cars are old and expensively restored? About thirty seconds. And then it gets boring. The worst part is that the whole town turns out for the endless cruise, the never-ending procession of brightly colored vintage cars. The crowd is usually more colorful than the cars, however: all sorts of people show up for the festivities. That's really the only interesting part, but even mullet-spotting loses its luster after a while. Along the course of things, I find wild thoughts flitting through my mind. Crazy impulses, mainly directed at spicing things up a bit. Like when I see a black, very mobster car, I think of how  cool  it would be to have guys with tommy guns hanging out the windows. And then I think of how  sweet  it would be to have them turn those guns on the crowd and fire blanks. And then I think of how  awesome  it would be to have people strategically placed on the sidewalk ... people with fake blood packets and white t-shirts on. People who would trigger small blood explosions, grab themselves and scream in apparent agony. Now  that  would be exciting! Shoot, they should let me plan some of this stuff. I'd get the thing national recognition. Those are honestly the kinds of crazy daydreams I have. I even smile to myself while I'm thinking them. So if you ever see me grinning to myself, don't ask. The other thing about Graffiti Night is that every teenage girl in the area shows up wearing the sluttiest apparel they own. Well, I don't literally mean  every  girl, because the girls I was with don't do stupid things like that. (Which is something that I really respect about them.) But anyway, I can't stand seeing what has to be a 13-year-old girl walking around in what I guess is supposed to be a skirt and wearing what I take to be a shirt that would look more at home on a toddler. I saw some females there that I knew but could hardly recognize through all the makeup and desperately artificial 'beauty' that some call cosmetics.  I love seeing girls who don't wear makeup. They look so much more beautiful when they're themselves, not trying to conform to some ridiculous standard or to fool anybody. It shows that they're comfortable with themselves and have more important things to do than worry about how people will perceive them. That, or they just didn't have time that morning to apply the crap. Makeup seriously freaks me out. It's disgusting: all greasy or powdery, disgustingly colorful, and nasty smelling. I'm glad I only wear it for really important events. But back to Graffiti Night: the guys are just as bad. Guys, eyes combing the crowd for girls to look at. Guys, dressed in their Abercrombie best. I noticed a very amusing phenomenon that occurs when a guy is walking around with his shirt off. He always has this look on his face that says very clearly what he's wondering: "Do I look hot?" I can't really explain the look, except that it also seems defiant: "Yeah, I'm not wearing a shirt. So what?" I actually saw a no-shirt man walk almost a block while caressing his chest. You can't blame me for watching. I thought, no way is that guy going to continue walking like that. So I kept watching. But this guy was all over himself; he even looked down at it sometimes. He was completely turned on by his own nipple. I think it goes to show: the only thing a man loves more than women is himself.
