Plants and animals continually adapt and evolve to meet the changing environment and all of the chemicals and pollution we pump into it daily, or they perish.  Popular media and art must evolve to mirror, embrace, or comment on our current state of social relevance is vital to art's very survival, or a disdainful audience will surely banish the unwanted art to velvet canvas and garage sale grab bags.  Darwin would have us believe even we as human beings have evolved from the most basic of life forms initially springing up from nothing at some point in the very distant past, or else our simian cousins might be surfing the Internet in our place, happily munching on a banana.  And as you no doubt have witnessed, dear reader, Nine Inch Nails, thankfully, has grasped the concept of evolution, though not so easily.  While many artists evolve as easily as one changes their clothing and thus remain in the public eye (see: David Bowie), and still others refuse to evolve and thus perish (see: hair metal), some artists struggle with altering their mindset in an effort to continue down the path of making genuinely meaningful and relevant music.  Following the enormous success of The Downward Spiral, its several singles and shocking videos that catapulted Nine Inch Nails into the mainstream (if their touring on Lollapallooza hadn't already), all of the live shows, soundtrack production, and umpteen interviews later, Trent Reznor found himself at a curious place.  Reznor does not pull punches when he describes Nine Inch Nails and himself following their last round of touring in support of The Downward Spiral, as a "bloated, stupid thing that had become a parody of itself."  Reznor was becoming the very thing he had so long rallied against...just "another retarded rock guy."  After viewing videotapes of himself and his band, and taking a personal inventory as a person, Reznor realized he "was shitty to people, shitty to old friends and new people [he] met."  He had become what he had never wanted to be when he set out to be successful musician.  "It didn't work," Reznor says of his state at the time.  "I could pretend I fit into that role onstage every night Â the antics and nonsense.  But alone I had a kind of bottoming out.  I was losing friends; I had the woman who raised me die.  Nothing seemed to matter.  The last thing I wanted to do was write an album."  And so Reznor was forced to take stock of his values, self, and the project called Nine Inch Nails, in an attempt to evolve and move forward.  In 1997, when Trent Reznor began working on Nine Inch Nails' third studio album The Fragile, he lost the grandmother who had raised him.  He had recently produced three Marilyn Manson albums, personally guiding the shock rocker to stardom and the top of the charts, only to then be snubbed by the jealousy of the Reverend Manson not long after.  Reznor found himself alone, without close family and friends, and ashamed of what he had become.  So the early stages of The Fragile and the writing involved did not come easily.  "I just didn't want to sit down with a notebook and see what was in there," Reznor says.  "I didn't want to uncap the fuckin' cauldron and see what came out."  After speaking with several friends, including producer Rick Rubin, Reznor temporarily left New Orleans in favour of a cozy house at one of America's most visually stunning locations Â Big Sur, California.  With its majestic cliffs and awe-inspiring views, advisors touted the magical quality of the scenery, which might help lift Reznor from the depths of his depression and break his self-imposed writer's block.  "That was terrifying," Reznor says of his time there.  "I went insane and almost killed myself sitting at a piano trying to write like Tom Petty does.  I think Petty's great.  I also realize that when I sit down and do that it starts to sound like Billy Joel's The Stranger."  The several months spent there alone with a piano proved largely unfruitful for the troubled musician, but the venture was not a total write-off.  Of the one solitary track that Big Sur yielded and would eventually find itself onto The Fragile, Left's "La Mer", Reznor remembers "sitting down and playing the piano and thinking 'How did I ever forget that this is what brought me joy?'  How the fuck did that get lost in the mess?  How did I let that happen?'  It's not doing interviews, it's not fucking live shows, not backstage passes and bank accounts of all that shit doesn't matter.  I did this because I love music."  Which is precisely the type of musician Reznor is Â a true composer.  While many artists, be they musically inclined or in favour of other artistic mediums, fail to cope and wrestle with their inner demons, Reznor would overcome his by simply making music. Several storied musicians helped Reznor with his writer's block, and coached him on how to battle the funk he was in.  David Bowie offered his advice even before Reznor fell into his dark slump, while Nine Inch Nails was still opening for Bowie in the late nineties.  "We had long talks when we were on tour together.  He said to me at one point...'try writing in the third person, because you'll find that you'll get yourself out of a hole that I was once in.'"  While Reznor wrestled with this suggestion, finding it difficult to do, he also considered the relevancy of how big Nine Inch Nails had become, and dealt with the personal demons that came with going from a cool, underground band to being well-known and successful, which possibly alienated many fans who didn't think such a band would be cool anymore.  "I could relate to that," Reznor comments.  "I didn't go to see the Jesus and Mary Chain after they got big.  So, I had to ask myself whether I should be trying to make my music more inaccessible, or should I just do what I think is true to myself."  It was actually Bono of U2 who offered the sage advice "fuck those people.  Don't ever think that what you do is so elite that it's only for certain people."  And so Reznor soldiered on, the core of his very self slowly evolving. Reznor accepted the fact he had become emotionally compromised, and set out to do something about it.  He flirted with psychiatry (now that would make for an interesting file to read), but quickly found it unsuccessful.  Reznor also flirted with medication, sampling Effexor and Paxil, but discovered antidepressants and Nine Inch Nails did not exactly go hand in hand. "I was in an abnormally positive mood all the time," Reznor states.  "Everything was like, 'It's okay.  We'll get to that.  Whatever.'  Part of what drives my personality got removed."   In the fall of 1997, Reznor decided the best course of action for battling his depression was to throw himself wholeheartedly into writing and recording The Fragile.  Returning to New Orleans and Nothing Studios, Reznor and producer Alan Moulder retreated to the confines of the Nothing compound for nearly two years.  Remaining almost totally aloof from the outside world, stepping out of the shelter of Nothing Studios only occasionally for the odd CD or to acquire an instrument, Reznor remained happily removed and ambivalent to the goings-on of the everyday world.  Instead, he turned his energies inward and simply tried to put all of the "mouldy, decaying" sounds in his head on tape.  Reznor poured himself into his music.  While many artists watch the clock, keeping tally of the costly hours involved studio time; Reznor knew no such troubles, situated as he was in his very own studio.  So he could focus on the music, without the typical distractions that might hinder the creative process.  And Reznor wasn't quick to dismiss the opportunity.  "...We would try things that I would've taken short cuts to arrive at in the past," Reznor says of the long hours spent in the studio.  "Like, instead of a background noise off a movie which was what Downward Spiral was all about we'd go find the original place and mic it.  Instead of a sample of a cello, it was like, 'Let's borrow one from down the street and see what happens if you put the wrong strings on it.  Whoa!  Check this sound out!'  We had space and time to try that kinda stuff." As Reznor and Moulder neared completion of the album, they found themselves with over forty tracks, and the revelation the music they had made in their self-imposed exile from the outside world might not be at all like anything the public currently considered palatable.  In an industry churning out bubblegum, midriff-baring pop music, The Fragile, Reznor realised, did not resemble anything being produced at the time.  Further, Reznor and Moulder both believed that after being holed up with the same music for such an excruciatingly long recording process, objectivity had been compromised.  "...'La Mer' was one of our favourites, and it was gonna be the first song on disc one.  Then it was 'Nah, let's make it the first song on disc two.'  Then 'Nah, let's make it the first single!'  'No, wait!  Let's call the album La Mer!'  And you approach a song like that with reverence you cherish it so much, you're not being objective about where it should go," Reznor stated as they came to the end of The Fragile's sessions.  Sensing yet another tailspin into countless obsessive-compulsive tangents, the duo put in a call to producer Bob Ezrin, mastermind behind one of Reznor's long-time favourites, Pink Floyd's The Wall.  After convincing the legendary producer to come and spend a week in New Orleans, Ezrin disappeared into the depths of Nothing Studios and three days later, he emerged with reams of notes.  In a very businesslike manner, he proceeded to tell Reznor what the weak spots on the album were, the highlights, and basically, the type of record Reznor had just made.  Excitedly, Reznor put on the compilation made by Ezrin, and found it to be..."terrible!  Halfway through the first side I was daydreaming, I was looking out the window," as he says of the first attempt at finalizing The Fragile.  Needless to say, it wasn't easy for Reznor to tell someone like Bob Ezrin that he had failed and his track order just did not suffice.  Further, Reznor began to doubt himself, wondering if the past two years spent in isolation had all been for naught.  Ezrin took the feedback in stride, however, and returned to the drawing board.  On the final day of Ezrin's visit, Reznor came into the studio in the morning to find some new discs sitting on his desk.  Of the morning, Reznor says "I wasn't particularly in a bad mood, but I sure wasn't in a good mood.  And I wasn't very optimistic about what I was gonna hear.  So I sat down right here and I put it on.  I didn't have a list of songs, so I didn't know what was coming.  And halfway through the first CD was when it hit me, when I started crying.  And I was thinking, 'if it ends now, it'd be perfect.'  Then I immediately put the second CD on thinking, 'Well, this can't be good because all of my favourite songs are on the first CD.  I uhhhh, think what else could be left?'  But it finished and I was stunned like, 'Fuckin-A!  Alright!' I couldnt believe it!  I had goosebumps!"  Poker-faced, Reznor called his last minute hope into his office, and had Ezrin sit down on his huge leather couch.  With a straight face, Reznor told him that he had done it, and Ezrin replied simply, "I know."  Reznor responded: "Well, why did you fucking well wait 'til the last day then, smartass?"  And they quickly embraced, for it was good.  It was very good, indeed.  In the fall of 1999, Nine Inch Nails and their new album, The Fragile, were quickly back in the limelight.  Debuting at Number One on the Billboard charts, Halo Fourteen moved 250,000 units in its debut week, before beginning to slip back down the charts.  Accompanied by the first single, "We're In This Together", The Fragile was a huge success with fans of all respects, but the album never quite achieved the success that its predecessor, 1994's The Downward Spiral did.  Speculation looked to several reasons, including The Fragile's length, or its not-so-radio friendly singles such as "Into the Void", and "Starfuckers, Inc."  Still, The Fragile was heralded as sonic mastery, and everyone clamoured to lift its mastermind, Trent Reznor, to their shoulders as the saviour of music.  Numerous publications put Reznor's scowling visage back on their covers, including Rolling Stone and Raygun, and Spin magazine went so far as to rank The Fragile as "Album of the Year".  While The Fragile did not enjoy the commercial success of the typical pop thoroughfare, the musical community happily embraced it, injected as they were with the newfound sense of hope and vitality that came with Reznor's double-album opus. The next step was a logical one.  Tour.  And so, slightly evolved and still inwardly smarting from his behaviour during The Downward Spiral touring years, Trent Reznor gathered together his long-time band mates, plus or minus a few members.  Keyboardist Charlie Clouser and bassist Danny Lohner returned to the NIN camp, and Robin Finck was re-called from his brief stint with Axl Rose and Guns N' Roses' long-awaited Chinese Democracy.  Former drummer Chris Vrenna had parted ways with Nine Inch Nails in favour of his new personal project, Tweaker, so in his stead Reznor recruited the relatively unknown Jerome Dillon.  After four years away from the stage, Reznor wisely planned several warm-up gigs in and around the world, including locations such as New Orleans, New York City, the Bahamas, as well as a memorable Grammy performance.  After a few private and small-audience sessions, Nine Inch Nails were back in shape, practiced on the new material, and they set out to assault the world with their unique slice of sonic boom.  Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails would go on to tour the world once over, including an Eastern global tour dubbed Fragility v1.0 and a Western hemisphere stint entitled, logically, Fragility v2.0.  As per usual, the visual act that was Nine Inch Nails was almost ridiculously impressive, and the tour was consistently ranked as one of the best live shows of the year, and even received said nod from Rolling Stone.  Reznor had taken the angst, intensity, and spectacle of Nine Inch Nails' live trademark, and further morphed it into a more eye-enticing display.  Fragility became the live manifestation of the Nine Inch Nails experience, and where the music had evolved and taken on a more mature and sombre attitude, so too, did the live concert.  Three large LCD displays majestically dropped from above the band early on in the show, and distorted, beautifully simple images flashed across the screen behind a slightly more subdued band.  While hardcore favourites such as "Head Like A Hole" and "Wish", as well as newcomers like "Starfuckers, Inc.", continued to whip the crowd and band into a frenzy, more restrained pieces such as "La Mer" and "The Great Below" were thrown into the mix to provide a more all-encompassing musical experience that truly ran the gamut of emotion.  The Fragile would see several singles and videos released, though only two would actually become official Halos.  Halo Thirteen, the single for "The Day the World Went Away", predecessor to the actual release of The Fragile, saw the ravenous appetite of Nine Inch Nails fans whetted by just three tracks.  Two tracks were actually pulled directly from the upcoming record, including the title track and "Starfuckers, Inc.".  Unusually, the release carried only one "Quiet" mix of "The Day the World Went Away".  Halo Fifteen, released after The Fragile, was the single for "We're In This Together", and numerous versions of the Halo were released internationally.  Some contained further remixes of "The Day the World Went Away", while still others carried two bonus tracks previously available only on the vinyl release of The Fragile, "10 Miles High" and "The New Flesh".  After the Fragility tour, as is tradition, Reznor returned to the studio and revisited his masterpiece, and emerged with Halo Sixteen, Things Falling Apart.  The obligatory Nine Inch Nails remix album saw Reznor hand over the reins primarily to those close to him, rather than complete all the reworking himself.  Old collaborators such as Keith Hillebrandt and Dave Ogilvie were recruited yet again, and band mates Charlie Clouser and Danny Lohner also contributed, among others.  A remix of Gary Numan's "Metal" was also thrown in as a tidbit of new material.  This hugely successful period of Nine Inch Nails life also brought with it Trent Reznor's official foray into the Internet.  Both nin.com and nothingrecords.com were launched, not to mention various other sites, such as objectmerch.com, carrying Nothing's official merchandise, and sub-sites for NIN releases, including andallthatcouldhavebeen.com.  Always the consummate perfectionist, Reznor's web sites were visually stunning and completely engrossing, and many hidden links and gems were cleverly disguised therein.  Always committed to the fans, Reznor also allowed the download of exclusive, Internet-only available material, including remixed tracks, live sequences from the Fragility tours, and pics.  In short, the Internet versions of Nine Inch Nails and Nothing Records were just what you expected from Trent Reznor. Following on the success of the Fragility tours, Reznor readied for the release of the first live material available from Nine Inch Nails.  Whilst touring, Reznor had had the foresight to plan the release of the material, and Reznor and crew routinely handed out camcorders to crew and fans in an effort to obtain more raw and true to life live experiences that aren't typically captured by the highly-polished, sweeping cameras of big budget live music.  Upon returning to New Orleans, Reznor and team set to work at their trusty Macs to put together and attempt to capture the live Nine Inch Nails experience on both CD and DVD.  To be the first DVD released by Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor wanted to ensure that if it was going to be done, it would be done right.  Halo Seventeen, And All That Could Have  Been, was just that.  After various delays, it was released in early 2002 to much fanfare.  Both the CD and DVD release truly captured the essence of Nine Inch Nails live, and further reinforced their reputation as possibly one of the world's greatest live bands.  Chock full of hidden 'Easter eggs', including unreleased videos and the live segment showing Trent Reznor and estranged friend Marilyn Manson reuniting on stage in triumphant renditions of "The Beautiful People" and "Starfuckers, Inc.", And All The Could Have Been truly showcased the magnificence of the live performances given by Nine Inch Nails and Trent Reznor.  As is typical with Nine Inch Nails, several different versions of Halo Seventeen were released, including a deluxe CD package containing a bonus disc entitled Still.  Also previously available individually via nin.com, Still featured a very stripped-down, raw musical version of the Nine Inch Nails product.  Months earlier, whilst on the North American tour of Fragility, Reznor and Nails stopped into a Chicago radio station and played an unplugged set to a very small and no doubt dumbfounded audience.  While the CRC Sessions, as they have so been dubbed, were never officially released, Reznor did revisit the concept following the tour, and Still is the result.  Free of the countless samples and harsh electronica that defines Nine Inch Nails' sound, Still featured just Reznor with a piano and guitar, along with several band mates equally as unplugged.  Haunting, raw, and viscerally beautiful, Still took many fans by surprise, showcasing the musical talent of a man often hidden behind a wall of cacophonous sound.  And now, years later, Reznor has retreated yet again into oblivion.  Since the release of And All That Could Have Been in 2002, Nine Inch Nails has not released anything, nor has much been seen or heard from the NIN camp.  Rampant speculation and the always churning rumour mill that is the NINternet have led to suppositions as to possibilities for the future of Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails.  For years, the Tapeworm project, involving any number of musicians including Maynard James Keenan of Tool and A Perfect Circle fame, Atticus Ross of 12 Rounds, Zach de la Rocha formerly of Rage Against the Machine, and Trent Reznor himself, continues to remain mired in obscurity and legal battles between the various artists' record companies.  While band mates of Reznor have moved on to side projects, such as Danny Lohner's recent production of the soundtrack to the film Underworld, nothing seems to be stemming from Trent Reznor's corner.  Nin.com has remained virtually unchanged for several years now, with the exception of very muddled, mysterious images and quotes loosely centered primarily on Ursula K. Le Guin's novel The Lathe of Heaven, that slowly appeared (and subsequently disappeared) over the course of several weeks in the fall of 2003, until nin.com finally closed its 'doors' several months ago in favour of a single graphic that prevents entry to the site.  Nothing Records has been equally unproductive, with little to no releases from long overdue artists like 12 Rounds, and the website, previously interactive and relatively interesting, has advertised the same upcoming releases for, quite literally, years.  What will the future of Nine Inch Nails hold?  With Reznor fast approaching his forties, he is not the young man full of piss and vinegar, unbridled hatred and animosity, and confusion and self-loathing that he was nearly two decades ago when he threw his hat into the musical ring.  Reznor will soon be negotiating middle-age, and with that comes a whole new host of inner speculation and soul searching.  The typical collection of thoughts on society, religion, life and death,  blah, blah, blah, undoubtedly still exist in Reznor's innermost being, but a new faction of concerns have no doubt surfaced, including love, family, and the possibility of children.  How will this new, older and wiser Trent Reznor interpret the world?  And more importantly, how will he choose to comment on it via the medium of music?  While unfounded rumours continue to spread, magazine articles become fewer and far between, and all but the most dedicated fan sites dwindle into obscurity, NIN fans now in the know as to typical periods of downtime between releases yet again patiently await the next album to, ahem, bleed through. xBuBzx
