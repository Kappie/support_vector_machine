A demi-god, yes, like ani difranco.  Okay, I am seriously worried about my current mental state, for it seems that  every one has been able to remember dreams of late and, I swear, I have not dreamed (or remembered dreaming) for something akin to several months. In fact, I have a sparse population of dreams in general. Can someone suggest for me something like tai-chi or a related psychological breathe-through-your-elbow-Eastern-meditation-twist-your-right-foot-around-your-neck-twice activity that will spark REM activity? Because I feel like a dry well, with the capacity but not the reality.  Caramel caribou is good. And no, I am not eating a sweetened animal. It's ice cream damnit.  I should like to abuptly state that Brock posted an utterly lovely poem tonight. Don't ask why, maybe it's the insight into sexuality or the fluid sturcture or just the imagery. But it clicks.  urlLink A very lovely poem .  Have an evening, mortals.
