Try to expand your vocabulary by at least one word - if for no other reason than to please me (and thus contractually agree to sell me your soul.) Mul - tip - ply.   mul·ti·ply  (mlt-pl) v. mul·ti·plied, mul·ti·ply·ing, mul·ti·plies  v. tr. 1.)To increase the amount, number, or degree of.  2.)Mathematics. To perform multiplication on.    Next person who says timesed (as in "one timsed what equals one?") will get a very real and personal bitchslap from me. Unless it's during school. Then I'll just kinda grumble about "mfmmmdeathmmfmmbombmmmmfmmschoolDIE!!!" Unless you're a girl. Then I'll just kinda ... do nothing.
