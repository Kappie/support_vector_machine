I'm well-read on the subject...I can see that George Bush isn't a visionary interested in democracy, and I can also see that this isn't a Jewish war.  However, the point on security in the region is important to note.  The Netherlands doesn't need security in the region.  Why do we?    And for those interested in the civilian casuality count in this war that the major news networks aren't willing to air,  urlLink here you go .
