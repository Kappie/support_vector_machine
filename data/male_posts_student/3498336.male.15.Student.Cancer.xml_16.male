Hmm i tried playing the region music.. its harder than last years.. i think.. well i only practiced it for like 2 minutes.. go me.. lol  Hmm.. theres a band barbecue today at Northshore.. and I wanna go.. but I don't feel like going lol I dunno.. i do but i don't.. hmm.. well i have like 20 minutes to decide if i'm going lol.. well I decided i'm gonna go... so I'm gonna go get dressed..  Oh and don't bother reading my schedule from the other day.. cuz i got changed to French 45 mintues.. so I'm pretty sure that will be second period with health and speech.. so yah.. everything will be moved around..
