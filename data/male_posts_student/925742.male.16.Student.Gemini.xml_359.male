I mean, I could divulge the most secret recesses of my brain, but that would obviously scare you off.  I'm not even kidding.  Hmmmm thats why I don't really talk about the inner workings of my brain much.  The facial stinging stopped a day or two ago completely, so I'm gonna put some tazorac on, and shave.  Good stuff.  Spinning the subject, I don't know whether or not to buy the cell phone.  Do I really really need one?  Really?  It would be kinda nice. I could call people and stuff.  If I need rides.  If I wanna do stuff and I'm not on AIM.  And just to hear another voice.  Also, It would work wonders for work.  It would be 25 bucks a month.  Sure I could afford that, but it would put a damper on my total income.  Plus I would have to learn all this new cell phone lingo like 'roaming' and......stuff.  And the workings of the plan.  And other stuff.  Although it would be nice......  Moving on, I tried to install Call of Duty, but it wouldn't work!  DAMN YOU, CDS BURNT BY AZNS!  Eh, I got it from Derek, who left today with about 6 eggrolls.   Call of Duty is an extremely realistic WW2 game.  Its practically the only ww2 game I would ever enjoy playing ever.  Aside from battlefield 1942.  But in fact, I probably would enjoy playing against bots only, since people online in that game would totally kick my ass.  So anyway, Call of Duty = OWN!  Then I beat the Deus Ex 2 demo, not very long, if you take the 'Hey, theres a guard, I'm gonna stab you, get your shotgun, hack that terminal, mann the turret, kill the other guards with the minigun, kill the leader-chick, and talk to the guy that initially gave me the mission' approach.  Like maybe half an hour.  Its models are gorgeous, and so is the lighting.  On par with Max Payne 2.  Yeah. Even better maybe?  Its very interactive, much like the first Deus Ex, which I barely played.  I haven't played Diablo 2 in a while and am kind've fiending.  Some things have gotten in the way of my game playing.  I haven't played Counter-Strike for four weeks, can you guess why?  7|-|3 |2345()/\/ |2|-|'//\/\35 \/\/17|-| |_1/\/\|3 9()/\/3  Hahahahah I just spoke leet.  Havn't done that in a while.  Here:  llmztranll: when our fam was at the zoo, and we were speaking vietnamese among ourself and some guy just started joining in w/ our convo llmztranll: and we looked back.....and we were like whooooo WrathS 01: *IM ACTUALLY LAUGHING* llmztranll: but it was cool WrathS 01: THATS HILARIOUS llmztranll: but he also lives in San Franciso llmztranll: where there a lot of vietnamese llmztranll: and he also took classes in college  WrathS 01: still talk to him or something? llmztranll: no llmztranll: he was just a stranger we met on the street WrathS 01: what were you talking about? llmztranll: i don't know llmztranll: but its one of those encounterment that u can't ever forget in ur life WrathS 01: because thats like the equivalent of me and my family talking about, say, abortion, and some dude just jumping in and saying 'Well I think abortion is wrong and against God's scheme.  What'd you all eat for lunch?  Hi my names Bill.' llmztranll: something like that  I thought that was pretty funny.  Anyway, I'm out of ideas for todizzle.
