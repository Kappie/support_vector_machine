This cd is mostly Liam Howlett mixin' it up real good on his turntables. The songs don't have names and that's because they're made with excerpts from other songs. Overall I'm saying that it's a great cd, however, I am still eagerly anticipating the release of Always Outnummbered, Never Outgunned as I was told that it was supposed to be out on June 1, 2004, but was later told that it's been pushed back to July 25th. Ah well, I can wait . . . I guess.
