Very well done, but obviously it's politically charged toward the left, and so because the bias is so obvious, it loses some of its bite.  It definitely leaves you thinking about the war and the gravitas (or lack thereof) of the current administration, but it also leaves you wondering which parts are really genuinely actual and which parts are easily rebutted and just carefully constructed sleight of hand.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I won't really delve into content -- but the truth is that even if I was to delve into content, I don't have that much to say.  Michael Moore knows a lot more than I do about the war.  All I know is what felt honest and what felt contrived.  But it's a solidly entertaining and interesting sit-through.  I can't help but recommend it.  Regardless of your politics.  But I also don't think it's going to change anyone's mind.  It'll just reinforce whatever feelings you've got.
