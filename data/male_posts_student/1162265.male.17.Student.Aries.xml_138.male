I'm pretty convinced after reading their writtings that many of them did actually communicate with God on a normal basis.  This one guy goes up to a really high class noble woman, who got him out of jail to try and convince him to accept the Church of England just falsly.  You know the first thing he said to her "Woman what do you want?"    These guys were insane.   This one woman in New England was banned from entering Boston ever again on threat od Death because she was a Quaker, but she believed in Religious Freedom she went back up to either make them rennounce the law or to have herself hung so others would question the law.  She goes up there, and they are about to hang her and refuse, and send her back to Virginia or something.  So now she's convinced that if they kill her, it will force tolerance down their throats.  So she goes to New England again and is hanged.  I was just like "Damn!" that's conviction.  Well, I'm going to vist Nia tommorow at Camp.  That'll be fun.  Signing off.
