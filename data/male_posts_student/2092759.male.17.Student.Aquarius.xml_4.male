Im tired as all fuck right now, but im staying up for quite sometime so I can finish all of the homework I have in AP History. There is no way in heaven, hell or whatever the fuck is in between that I am going to finish the homework and understand it enough to do well on the test. The field show (Carmena Burana) was decent tonight. Tone was a lot better, but the tempo still rips in places. We should be decent by the comp next week, at least enough to show significant improvment. I have a date for Homecoming! I went to the game tonight, and Sara and Suchit (Two bando seniors from last year) were there. I started talking to Sara about how Smeagol had a date, and I still didnt. She told me she wanted to go, and now were going. Im preety happy becouse i get to go as opposed to sitting at home on my nerdy ass while my little shit of a brother goes to a dance (with a girl no less!). Ok, i had better go and actually start working on the friggn Histroy assighnment or im going to fail horribly.  Bye Everybody! (Bye, Dr.Nick!)
