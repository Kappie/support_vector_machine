And unfortunately, that set the tone for my mood throughout the week, after a soothing break down south in Singapore. And look! It’s Thursday night. This confounded mood is probably going to carry on into the weekend. God! I think I’m going to sleep this entire weekend and save the trouble of feeling moody and sulky. Well, shit happens... I’m also pretty peeved that a certain senior prefect decided to run his mouth at me for being a statue while doing duty. He can ( this part has been censored to safeguard the “U” rating of this blog ). I’ve been threatened, intimidated, stared down and laughed at by students of that class and yet I have the guts to walk up to them and talk to them. And even if I am a statue, it’s as if he’s any better. All he does is stand at the back. Walk up. Walk down. Walk up. Walk down. You get the picture... And since my row has eight prefects on duty, which makes a ratio of one prefect for every ten students, I don’t understand why about five are always at the back. Am I missing something there? Is the view the better? Is the air there fresher? Blinking prefectorial board. And in other highlights, yours truly has managed to stay two periods of Biology without falling asleep!! A record has been set! If I can keep it up again tomorrow, it’ll be the longest continuous time awake for Biology lessons gone through by me. Anyways, Singapore is a nice country. Although I’ve supposedly been there loads of times ( the only thing I can remember is the airport for some reason or the other ), this definitely will change my mind a lil’ teeny bit about that country. (Note: Prior to this, I was always of the opinion of stationing a couple of tanks in Johor Bahru to invade them). Everything there is efficiently run, such as their MRT’s, and the system for everything works just fine ( except for their immigration checkpoint ). And everyone there is loaded! I mean, who has heard of 26 bucks for a bloody cup of coffee? Who else can boast of seeing a Rolls-Royce, Ferrari and ten Maserati’s parked in one row all in the space of three minutes? And I was just in a car park, not at a car show! Ahh, I feel much lighter now................   Norwich City 3 MPPJ 2. (Hmm…something’s not right with that score!!!)  Fusion16/2331hrs
