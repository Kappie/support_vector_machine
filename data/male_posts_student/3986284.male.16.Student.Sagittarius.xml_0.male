It was great, the highlight of it was that we came out of the dragon's den backwards and flipped over. But there was a lot of other good things, like eye candy. You know I thought about talking to some of them, but I didn't b/c of a thought in the back of my head about the woman who "loves" me, Laura. But anyway, there was also free food and everytime i got a soda i couldn't finish it but oh well. Yeah I got sunburned on my shoulders, a lil on my arms, and my feet. Lol, last night I put baby oil on them, i looked sexi. I'm gona blog about what happened to day later, b/c hopefully I can talk to Jojo before then. byeeeeee
