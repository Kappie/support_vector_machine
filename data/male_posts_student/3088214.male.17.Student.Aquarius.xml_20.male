The other has the cover of the Kennedy family at JFK's funeral and of course my favorite...1969 Neil Armstrong walks on the moon...Guess what the Mercury seven were furious they weren't chosen to be the one who walked on the moon - they picked Neil...He must have had the "RIGHT STUFF" -  By the way I have been so thirsty for a glass of tang.  I will make sure to bring those in...  Those in 6th period I am going to start at 7:00 am on Wednesday because Sam is going to lecture about Vietnam...Boys bring doughnuts and girls bring juice and cups and I will bring coffee...  Also - the mornings of Thursday and Friday I am with Ms. Winters - we are going to go over 6 to 7 American art slides and then do an art project - There was an Andy Warhol question two years ago...she said it was fine if we wanted to review on the balcony or the side room.  Cheers - I am going to the gym.  Clark
