Lack of sleep and constant fights with my little brother, it just keeps on going... and I think my head is gonna explode. Well, atleast it's Thursday, another day of school then I get my 10 hours or so of sleep... but then there's the T.H.E. project.   I've been frequently listening to The Cure since Monday. I've heard the band before, but now that I'm listening to their music more, I sometimes go on a trance. I'm just sitting there, listening to their music, staring blankly into space and not minding anything else. Their unlike any band I've heard before. The lyrics, the guitar riffs and solos, the drum beat, the bass guitar and the keyboards. It sends chills to my spine (espescially in the song "Just Like Heaven").   It's just not the same. I'd look where you are, but you're not there. It makes me feel empty, knowing you're nowhere near me. I long for the moment when your eyes meet mine, then I know everything is great again. I miss you.
