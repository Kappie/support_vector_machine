Here it is...I hope:  2001 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD 4x4 Crew Cab/Short Bed w/ Duramax diesel engine and Allison auto trans.  Bullydog propane and nitrous injection, Banks Power exhaust, exhaust brake, chip enhancer, all the greatest stuff and more...and that's just the engine compartment!?  Ok...so there's more:  CST 12" suspension lift w/ dual Fox 2.5" remote reservoir shocks all around, Deaver springs, Donahoe traction bars, and some more stuff.  How about some 20" Weld racing wheels...sound nice? Yeah, put some 39.5" meats from Interco on there and some o' those little Asian bastards could drive underneath me.  Oh well. If I can get the cash to get it all done, in the the immortal words of Sir Cam of Nastie, "spiffy."  Yeah, it could probably take most of those Asians int he 1/4 mile too.  Ok, so that's the first half of the equation. The other half is the bike. And I'm not talking some six year old's little 18 speed mountain bike that never sees dirt here, I'm talkin a monstrous, race winning, crazy ass mother fucker.  Like the Yamaha YZ450F. The top of the top motorcross style fast as a mother fucker type bike. Yes, for all you lamans, it's a motorcycle. And no, I don't care if I misspelled LAMAN!!!  All right, that's it for the cars...until I get one, then I'll start braggin' my ass off. 'Til then....peace.
