She's going to camp and then the day before she gets back i leave for the weekend in idaho. So i can't see her until after July 11. Unless she's too busy then. OMG I hope not. well yeah idk what to do right now so I'm just going to go talk to her right now before she leaves.  catch you cats on the flip flop later
