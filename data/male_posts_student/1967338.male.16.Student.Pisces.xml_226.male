I have quite a few friends of different religions, and i thought about free will. We obviously have the right not to believe in God, or Jesus.  Otherwise we wouldn't have free will.  Also, how could people of different religions believe so adamantly in there own as I do in mine if there weren't some truth in it?  In general moral belief, all religions are pretty much the same.  I mean, generally one doesn't hear of actual satan worshiping religions, becasue they'd be out killing everyone including themselves. Of course, if you worshipped satan, you proobably would belive in God and Jesus, you'd just be on the opposite side.  What we do hear about are Extreme Puritans, or terrorists. They aren't always Muslims, they just are currently.  I'm not quite sure where i was going with all this, but its a random thought that hit me.  Discuss.  Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret.
