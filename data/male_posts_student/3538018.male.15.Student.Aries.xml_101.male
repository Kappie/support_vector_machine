As i have said before, I have very mixed emotions on the whole trip because yeah, the trip is gonna be AWESOME!!!  I mean im going to 4 different countries over the next three weeks, who wouldnt be totally head-over-heels ready to go right?  Well in my case, wrong.  Through all the excitment I feel everytime i think about the trip, its whenever i dont think about it (which suprisingly enough is often) i think of things that i am going to miss so much when im gone.  I know its not like forever and blah blah blah, just three weeks but to those people i feel like me going is letting them down in someway...i dunno.  I will miss you all for the next three weeks but it is guranteed that i will be back...that i can promise.  I can also promise that anyone that wants a postcard etc. if they just tell me, they will get one. lol...so yeah....  so today went alright and i got a lot of stuff done.  went to appointments all day till 3 (3 of them!) and then came home and watched the rain....kinda a gloomy day and actually made me kinda depressed until someone just came right out and appoligized to me.  That really made me feel like I was important and that she really DID care what happend to us and if we were friends cause for the longest time, i thought she didnt.  Felt really good to know that and actually made my day a whole lot better. Thanks! he rest of the day was spent with my older brother and seeing him for the last time prolly this summer seeing as he has so much going on with baseball and all the other sports he does.  I do idolize him in what he does....the commentment he shows day in and day out all summer long and all year with baseball is truly amazing.  I do play hockey a lot but not near as much as he plays baseball....truly inspiring to me and my career (if you can call it that) in hockey.  So yeah, good seeing him and he will be missed of the course of the summer....  So i guess ill explain a little of my trip in here to yall because i think a lot of people are confused as to what i am doing over there...we are not just going to england and we are DEF not just going to london. lol  It is a three week journey (as i call it) all accross the British Isles.  We go to England (yes we will go to London) lol) Scottland, Whales, and of course PARIS!!!!!!! (my parents planned that just for me =) So yeah, should be lots of fun...going with 2 of my cousins, grandma, mom and dad, brother (younger) and friend....lots of fun but home will be missed.    so tommorow is full of packing and then tommorow night will be spent with the one i think I will miss the most...meeta...this past month and a half have truly been amazing and am sorry that i have to go for so long at such a good time in our relationship....i will be back though that is for sure...and we will be fine and make it through these next three weeks.  There is no one that I would rather be with right now and am so happy and loucky to have you....you truly are an amazing person....dont go changing while im gone....whatever that may mean =).....  so i am extremly tired now seeing as that i had to wake up extremely early to go to all my appointments so im out...everyone have a GREAT month of june and I will see everyone in late june when i return....lata days.....  "...Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Be strong. Believe...."
