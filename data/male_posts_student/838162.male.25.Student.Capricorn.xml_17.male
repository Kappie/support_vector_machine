For those not in the  > I had my second (and last) wisdom tooth operated on today (as in Monday, I do realize that when I post this it would be Tues already.  It hurts. Kinda like a throbbing ache in the mouth, even when I’m jazzed up with painkillers. Glad that this will be the last time that I have to do this. At least I have the whole week to recover from it. Man that bites! (get it? Bites? Wisdom tooth?…oh nevermind. Lame)  In a way this is good timing, as starting from next week I’ll be beginning to clear my leave. I will have two weeks of half days in camp, but that’s ok. I still will have the afternoons to study. The other reason is that I have an assignment due just after Deepavali. Since I have done the research, I have the whole week to write it out. Yaay! Only problem, I’m afraid that I will be so jacked up on the painkillers that I would be rendered unproductive, like today for example. However seeing as I am able to blog past the midnight hour, this is a good sign. I’m a little afraid that I will not be able to finish the assignment on time, but back in my poly days I was juggling three to four subjects and each had their own assignments due barely a week from each other. I guess it’s the getting up to speed on studying after so long that is bothering me.   >
