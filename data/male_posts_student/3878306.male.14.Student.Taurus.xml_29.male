Your best bet would be to order it from  our site  (you can always mail-order it if you don't want to do the PayPal  thing), or if  you know of a record store that's a bit smaller, you can ask them to  special- order our CD from our distributor, Darla.  And yes, the Duke is Symbion Project.  cheers, Liz E.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Well freezepop didn't let me waiting for long and they E-mailed right back. Only problem is this CD maybe I'll money order...
