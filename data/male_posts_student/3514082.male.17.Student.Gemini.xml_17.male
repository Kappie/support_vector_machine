Whoops! Luckily the mast fell sideways missing both me and Tim, otherwise it would have hurt. It should be fixable though hopefully, but it now means we are stuck without two man sailing for the summer. Thankfully the nice new  urlLink Laser Vortex  is working fine I was on it yesterday again, hehe and the new laser hull dad got us works fine so we have to very good single man boats. 
Any way sorry for going on a bit. I'm gonna go have my lunch and eat a nice large sandwich.
