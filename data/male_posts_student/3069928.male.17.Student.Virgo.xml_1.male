Well, last night at Radio City Music Hall in New York, the Kerry/Edwards campaign held a fundraiser where many celebrities came together with several music artists to push the Kerry-Kool-Aid-Drinking rhetoric down the throats of hundreds of partisan Kerry supporters. Obviously, no liberal would object to this. When celebrity leftist elites like Chevy Chase, Meryl Streep, and Whoopie Goldberg unite to raise money for a democrat like Kerry, you can be sure more than air is going to be hitting the fans...  As the fundraiser opened, Senator Kerry remarked that "every performer here represents the heart and soul of the American people."  Oh really?  Shortly after the introduction, Whoopie Goldberg came on stage and went on a tirade using President Bush's name as a sexually explicit reference to the female genitalia. Her X-rated comedic repitoire was followed by a slew of Bush-bashing comments from other high-profile figures. Actress Jessica Lange called Bush "a self-serving regime of deceit, hypocrisy and belligerence." Paul Newman said Bush's tax cuts were "borderline criminal." Chevy Chase made a remark saying the latest book Bush had read was "Leader of the Free World for Dummies." Among these comments, the ever so clich√© arguments of "No blood for oil!" and "How many lives per gallon?" and "Bush lied; people died!" were in full swing. Of course, no democratic fundraiser would be complete without some sort of music figure like John Cougar Mellencamp working "Bush is a thug" into one of his songs.  Now in all honesty, which sane moderate or right wing American isn't surprised about this type of rhetoric from our pals from Beverley Hills? Anyone who knows anything of the political world knows Hollywood is dominated by the left wing and their extremist utopian ideals. Heck, it all started back during the Vietnam War when a young "Hanoi" Jane Fonda went on her pro-communist, anti-American campaign in order to undermine the efforts of our troops.  Unfortunately, this type of Hollywood leftist bomb-throwing is all but the standard these days. The real problem is that John Kerry, who could very well one day be President, did not condemn these comments--even when they were going on  at his very fundraiser.   How does "Bush is a liar" express "the heart and soul" of every American out there? Last I checked, the majority of this country approves of Bush, and he is still leading in the polls against Kerry. So wouldn't saying that such radical comments represent the opinions of so many American citizens be a serious misjudgement, if not a downright lie? Kerry was reported as gleefully laughing and accepting the X-rated jokes being made by Goldberg while in the crowd.  But it doesn't end there.  Kerry hopped on a plane this morning, with John Edwards, to continue his campaign into West Virginia... only to talk about America's values.  America's values? This guy has the gall to go to a fundraiser, condone bombastic rhetoric from Hollywood's leftist elite, then goes on to a swing state in the election to talk about values? This is the most blatant hypocritical act Kerry has engaged in yet. This entire situation is just as comparable to his claims that he is a devout catholic, yet he has no problems condoning and supporting the heresy of abortion and the pro-choice stance.  John Kerry has no "values." The only values this man has is bastardizing what is good and holy in this country.  I know people have said this before, but this is just another example of John Kerry being an opportunist. He never really has a concrete stance on anything anymore--even when it comes to the extreme rhetoric spouted by Hollywood nuts. He's always catering to both sides, and always tries to act as if he's everyone's friend.  It's all about politics. It's ok if some high profile pop-star or actor calls Bush a Nazi, or something along those lines, but when Republicans use the F-word with a Democratic senator, EVERYONE gets in a tizzy. Aren't these liberals the same ones who want freedom of expression?  Oh, now I remember. Freedom of expression is only needed when the "expressions" conform to their agendas.
