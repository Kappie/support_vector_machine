I mean, at least I don't claim I am t3h 1337 h4x0r or anything.  Besides, I came across some forum earlier, for various reasons, which was a programming one (agh, this isn't helping my case for not being a geek!) and there was the usual 'chat-up lines' thread that comes up on any forum, except these were like 'You want to get beneath the cascading style sheets?' - See, they are geeks! Not me!  Anyway, this post is pointless, and it's ten to one, agh, I'll post something worth reading tomorow..I promise..  Jonny.
