THERE ARE HOLES IN A BOOK THAT GOD WROTE ?!  ugh!  some people!  goodness... just wanna take some people by the hair and just shove their face in a Bible... maybe they'll read it!  oh wait its gettin better!  now they are talkin bout other "gospels" that are not in the Bible.... hmmmm wonder why?  you think maybe if they were inspired by God that they would  BE IN THE BIBLE !  ok thats it... i'm done for now.  i could go on for hours but i'm gonna have to go to bed.  so yes... night kids.  sleep well.  oh and by the way.. on this show full of crap, they are now saying that Mary Magdalene was an "apostle".  can you spell S-T-U-P-I-D?
