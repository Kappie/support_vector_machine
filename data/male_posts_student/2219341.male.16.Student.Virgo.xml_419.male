HEY i gotta good idea!  i'll post somethin on my blog!  ha.  man now you know i'm bored.  i hardly ever post stuff in the middle of the day.  well i guess its not really the middle of the day.  its 3:13 here at the moment.  hot outside as usual.  Dad wants some stuff raked up outside.  i think i shall go out there when i'm done.  i've been tryin to be nicer and more understanding of my parents since the other day.  lemme tell ya... its kinda difficult.  but i'm trying.  i just keep thinkin before i respond to anything.  to make sure i dont sound irritated or anything.  but yes anyways.  i need to get my license replaced cuz i lost my wallet and everything.  i guess Mom and i will go down to the DMV and get that fixed tomorrow or somethin.  we're not sure if we're gonna go to NY anymore.  i really want to but none of our friends up there would be there so Dad's thinkin bout waitin for October.  that would be cool.  i havent been back to Long Island during the fall in a LONG time.  hmmm... what else.  i'm a little upset bout some friendship stuff but i think i'll write bout that tonight.  so yeah.  time to hit the post button.  au revoir.
