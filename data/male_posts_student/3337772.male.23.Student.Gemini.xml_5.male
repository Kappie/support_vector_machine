This pakistan/india guy runs towards us, yelling because of Lia.  I calmly explain this is a service dog, showed him my ID. He refused to read it. I told him I'm not leaving until I buy my beer, and if you dont like it, call the police. He said "No Police!"  ok, you're screwing yourself over, dude... He threatened us with a metal pole, a wine bottle, and grabbed/stratched Viktor. Ended up kicking all the customers out, locking us inside the store, and FINALLY called the cops.  Today, I received the police report in the mail.  I will quote the end of the report (the first half is my, Viktor's, and Mak's description of what happened...)  "The Manager (Aruind Patel) states that the two individuals had been outside the store for  approximately 30 minutes and only entered the store adter he had turned the lights off (and was locking up).  The manager stated that he was trying to explain to the customer that the store was closed, and the customer refused to leave. Manager stated that the metal pipe was used to brace the front door when he locks the store for the night. The manager stated he never threatened the customer with the metal pipe or a wine bottle. When the customer refused to leave, the manager locked the 2 in the store and called UPD. Both parties were involved of the complaint procedures. Dispute settled at this time."   WHAT THE FLIPPIN F**K!? apparently Mak wasn't involved... huh. and gee, when we arrived at the store, I was still smoking... so of course, I can't smoke in the store. We three were outside for maybe... 3-5 minutes while I finished my smoke.  There WERE customers in the store, lights were on, they were open. In fact, 2 customers tried to help me out, but decided against after the manager yelled at them, scurried off and made their purchase and left. some didnt even get to buy their liquor, they were kicked out.   Great. Monday, I'm calling the court house and setting a date for court. I'm takin this motherf**ker down!
