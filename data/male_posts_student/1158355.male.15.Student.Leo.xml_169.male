It's the best song ever, not even joking. We ordered Dominos, did some other fun things. We checked out this back masking website. Really freaky. We started getting afraid of the monsters in my house. It was great fun. I slept at Paul's. We watched Waterboy and this morning we went to Quiznos. Then we went back to my house and my parents came home. We played some Mario Party and now he's teaching me math for tomorrow's regents. I hope I don't fail. I'm really tired, and I'm sick of school. I'm sick of the hardness, and how hard all the gay tests are. I'm sick of the snow. I'm sick of the cold. I'm sick of the same fucking routine and seeing the same boring people everyday. I'm sick of the teachers teaching me things I'm bound to forget in a day, I'm sick of the rules. I want the summer, paradise. I want to ride into town with friends every day, play a bunch of fun sports, perform with my band. Not this fucking hell. I fucking hate all of you for this world you've all created. I want freedom.
