I went to See's Candies and a hair saloon store to get candies (a pound of them) and some nice gel. Then i got back and watched some Reno 911, then i packed, then we went to west portal to get some food for the smores tonight, and there was a huge line to Farhenheit 9/11, and i really want to see it, hopefully itll still be in theatres when i get back. so, we had a campfire thingy again, and then we played football till about 9, then i was tired and started packing more. Still have a lot to do. very excited about the trip. you can always go to http://www.sfsymphony.org/templates/youth.asp?nodeid=82 and find your way around, there will be a person posting news and updates during the tour, with pics. The link to the tour pages will become active after we depart. sooo, if i have the chance i might post something up, but there wont be any pictures until i get back, since i dont think there will be computers available with the plug ins and all that stuff. I definetly will post smoe really good pics that i take from Florida and defiently the Euro tour. post soon
