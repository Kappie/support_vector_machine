The colleges I plan on applying to as of now:  University of Arizona University of Colorado Stanford University University of Michigan University of Maryland Arizona State University  Those are in no particular order, and the list is pretty much devoid of small schools simply because most smaller schools don't have Aerospace Engineering, which is what I plan on doing.  My birthday's coming up, if anyone was any great ideas what to ask for, let me know.  -alex
