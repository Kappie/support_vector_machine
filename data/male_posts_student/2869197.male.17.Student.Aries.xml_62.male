I went to a book store called Borders yesterday. I still have loyality ties to Barnes and Noble, but if they're going to build their freekin store  3 miles away, they should expect me to be a little promiscuious in my bookstore selection. Borders is alright. No Starbucks inside, but there are at least two in walking distance, so no prob there. What I like about Borders is its style of bookshelving. On every thinkable wall surface area, there are bookshelves crammed with books! There are shelves standing in the middle, shelves on the walls, shelves connected to the walls...books are everywhere! I still haven't gotten used to the organization of the store (if there is one) but I have found a couple books considerably worth buying.   "U" stands for Ultimate Frisbee. We played deep into the night, and then went and got drinks at Starbucks. I really don't know who won. It reminded me of the games of UF we would play in Eagle Pass, while waiting for the insurance company to send us the right vans. I'm not very athletic and I don't have terribly good accuracy, but I can play and run well enough. I hear we have a fledgling UF club starting in Mona Shores. Oh, happy day indeed! I'll have to hook up with them.  Free morning today. I ran off to First Congregational Church for a little religion. They spoke of friendship, which is ironic (or predestined providence) since I'm thinking of friends. The basic idea of friendship they created was composed of four parts: (1) friends hang out with each  other (2) friends can talk sincerely with each other (3) friends love each other deeply (4) friends are there and willing to respond when you call for them. The first section really limits the number of people I call friends. I hang with no one outside of school and sports...at all. Except for Emily, who I've begun to hang with regularly. Maybe family as well, but they're in a totally different category. (2) is also hard since I feel nervous bringing up any subject of real worth to anyone. (3) and (4) are easy for me. I love and am hard pressed to think of someone I do not love. Even my wee brother, who can thrown some stumbling blocks in the realm of brotherly love, is lovable. For (4), well, I'm always here. Really, I can be contacted and rushed in to most any real situation. Were someone to call me and say, "Dan, I need you in Antartica in three days. I'm faxing you a ticket and providing your clothing.", why, I start walking to the nearest airport. Of course, this is rarely challenged or tested, so who knows how responive I really am.
