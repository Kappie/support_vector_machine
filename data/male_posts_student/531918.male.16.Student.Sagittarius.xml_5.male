So sue me.  I'm aware of the stereotype Magic players get.  We live in our parents' basements.  We do nothing but play the game.  Our entire paychecks go towards new cards.  Most of these players are over the age of twenty-one, though.  I'm just a casual player.  I'm more into music than the card game, to be honest with you.  But, it is fun.  That, and my fellow counselors at camp hold large Magic tournaments during our free time.  It's fun.  What I don't like are the  other  card games out there, such as Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Duel Masters, Harry Potter, etc.  They all copied from Magic, because Magic has been around since 1993.  The earliest any of the other mentioned games came out was around 1998 (Pokémon).  However, I could contradict myself by saying that all card games of this nature (as well as all RPG video games and fantasy novels) are inspired from books by authors such as J.R.R. Tolkien.  That explains the popularity of those  The Lord of the Rings  movies (none of which I have seen, nor do I intend to).  Whatever.  It's just something I do, and it's fun.  End of rant.
