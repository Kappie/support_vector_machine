Some will know Christ sooner.  Some will know Christ some time later.  Some will come to know Christ only after searching for a long time... those who seek will find.  Some just don't care and will never see the light.  i see God speaking through the many things happening around me.  i have compassion for those that will never accept Christ... those who reject Christ despite all the efforts of those around them... despite the love of an omnipotent, infinite God... in spite of all... i see those around me in school... they are so shallow compared to those in our fellowship... what is their chief end?  it should have been to glorify God and enjoy in Him forever, but they have made it a girl, or a guy, or some material possession, or the act of sex, or grades, or something else... everything but God.  Pray...
