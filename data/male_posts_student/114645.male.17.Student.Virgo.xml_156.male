I know it is in May, but think about it. That is only two months away. We need to get our dresses and tuxes and stuff. And of course, the BLUE limo. Lol  But other then that, this week has gone normal. In Physics we are working on waves. In French we are working on, well French, lol. In Aviation, we are working on weather depiction charts. In American Literature we are doing poetry. In History we are doing the 19th century. In math we are working, on well math. Dur! Well. I'm outta things to say. I'm watching American Idol.
