My guides find it funny - that is they think it is based on ignorance.  In some traditions this is enough to cast a lot of doubt on anything - however, I will be fair about it and look at the other stuff.  Apparently in Kaos magic drugs, weird sex, and body deformations are acceptable (one source I looked at encouraged being buried alive).  I hope the majority of practitioners realise the stupidity of these practices - mind altering techniques destroy your humanity (try having a serious talk with a drug addict), Body deformations change the energy patterns away from the norm - which might be useful if you know what you are doing, but is dangerous if you don't know (imagine someone chopping an ear off believing it would make them stronger - a great way of meeting girls).  As for the kinky sex - whatever turns you on, but if you like the kinky stuff then you don't need to hide it behind magic.  There are many things out there in the realm of magic which is dangerous.  More standard traditions have the advantage of strong protective techniques.  When I first started looking at magic I was given the following advice - "Come all the way in and learn properly, or stay well away.  Anything else is dangerous."  To anyone studying Kaos magic: ask yourselves why you study it.
