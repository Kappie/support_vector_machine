Krugman: Surely this wasn't just about reserving contracts for administration cronies. Yes, Halliburton is profiteering in Iraq â€” will apologists finally concede the point, now that a Pentagon audit finds overcharging? And reports suggest a scandal in Bechtel's vaunted school-repair program.   Me: If you were so inclined, you could play a drinking game using the words 'cronies', 'Halliburton', and 'plan' whenever you read a NYT Op-Ed segment.  Don, you probably shouldn't play right now.  As for the overcharging 'scandal', I will have to look into it since this is the first I've heard.  Same for Bechtel.  I'll get back to you with what I find.  The rest of this is typical Krugmanical wandering through the desert, punctuated by fevered denunciations of Bush.  Read at your own risk.
