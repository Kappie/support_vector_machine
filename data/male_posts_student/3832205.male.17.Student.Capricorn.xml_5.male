I have spent a lot buying all the computer parts themselves which are top of the line, and even more of the lighting and moding equipment.       The mods I have done so far are, window X in the side with blue Neon Cold Cathode light, flue LEDs in fan controller, blue LED in CD-Rom, Blue power and HDD LEDs (which are wee not yet installed when I took these pictures), a SAVKA cut in the other side of case where the window isn't, blue neon string under they keys on the keyboard, blue LED in mouse, blue tinted plastic on mouse, and last blue Neons in each side of the front of the sub, with blue tinted plexy glass over the front of subs and speakers.       That is not all I plan on doing, I also will be installing blue Neon legs, but I am not sure when I am going to do that. I will also be buying the 6800U, best Video card on the market, which will be godly :).       Here are some pictures of the mods without the blue power LED and blue HDD led not yet installed (They are now).        urlLink Pic 1        urlLink Pic 2
