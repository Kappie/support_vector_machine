Right now, I am busy reading about Hindutva, about revolutionary struggles form the past--I am sharpening my intellect. I am determined to create a better world or at least make a contribution to the struggle.  I have been giving thought on where I will be in a few years. I know if things work out, I will have had spent some time in New York and time in S. Asia and the Middle East and possibly a quick stop over in Europe. I am looking forward to the new experiences and adventures that lay in front of me and am anxious to get on with them. Although I have desired peace for long, I am not able to be content with it either. Maybe it is a product of youth or fear of old age, I do not know...  Last night my brother and his friend called and told me they watched Moore's film as well. They told me they cried after the movie because they felt bad for making fun of the activism I have been involved in. It was a wierd feeling hearing him tell me that....  PS  I am not sure if folks are interested in my political commentary... Are folks interested in political stuff? Most of my time is now being spent on that.
