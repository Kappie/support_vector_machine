(I never needed it for my previous PowerBook, and I'm pretty gentle with my hardware, who could have seen this coming?)  Oh well.  The empty box came to my parents' place this morning, I went over lunch to pack it up, and it got picked up this afternoon.  Hopefully it won't take the 2-4 weeks they said.  I hope they also don't wipe my drive.  I'm a little worried that I'll lose some of my work (mainly the coding stuff that I don't have backed up real well).  I don't think they have much of a reason to fudge with the HD, but it does have Tiger preview on it (legally, of course), so I'm a bit worried.  I had to tell them my login/password over the phone, so I hope the guy heard my password correctly.  I should just made an apple/apple account.  Hindsight.  I'll note when I get it back.  In an unrelated note, Alex and I got to move about 15 computers across campus today.  3 at a time in the heat, it was unpleasant to say the least.
