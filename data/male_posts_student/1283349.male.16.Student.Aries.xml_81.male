Really, with the daily things I have to do, I have a good hour, hour and a half of work to do in a single day. Mostly in 15 minute increments. Frickin' IT is finally going to get me my own personal computer today, the slowboats. They said "in five minutes," so it'll be another hour, or perhaps a day. I'm not sure if I've broken their code yet.  Fun stuff tonight, though! I'm going to see Captain Blood-- A Pirate Melodrama with the lovely Miss Casmus! Pirates, throwing popcorn, and scallywags. What can be better?  *pause in writing for 10 minutes*  Holy moly, 5 minutes actually meant 5 minutes. These IT people are  crafty . Back with an update soon.
