I got about 3 hours of sleep last night, but was completely energized, somehow.  I guess tea in the morning is really good.  Tea is good!  Stop drinking coffee and start drinking green tea, people!  Not much else today.  Except for the whole girl thing.  Yeah, I like her.  But who is it?  *spooky noise* yeah I'm not sayin here.  HA!  Dagz: but yeah I don't know what to do about this theft thing. I have no idea who it was now, becuase I only had two suspects and both have been pretty much been proven not guilty Dagz: so we have nobody to wreak vigilante justice on WrathS 01: oh WrathS 01: come ON WrathS 01: youre kidding me WrathS 01: than instead of vigilante justice, lets wreak vigilante revenge WrathS 01: its pretty much the same thing Dagz: hahaha WrathS 01: except works much better. Dagz: because we can attack random people instead of having a reason? Dagz: hahaha WrathS 01: yeah, dereks and my world, you dont need a reason to fight WrathS 01: you start foaming at the mouth and then beat the holy shit outta them kung fu style WrathS 01: well thats mainly dereks world.
