JFK is a really great movie as well. club dread was kinda a disspointment, but it was still funny. super troopers is better. i really miss my better half. its getting pretty sad. i met these really cool girls last night, and 3 of the 4 were sisters, and they were up here from detroit cause they have a house up here, and they were really cool, great taste in music and movies, and whatnot. summer is really kinda boring. i got  a really cool promise ring shirt, and an even cooler thursday shirt. i think that i had a crush on one of those girls last night, which really hasnt happened to me in a long time. but makes me happy nonetheless.   im currently listening to a lot of, rilo kiley, at the drive in, the cure, the beta band, belle and sebastian, yo la tengo, the velvet underground, the promise ring, pavement, nada surf, sonic youth, my bloody valentine, morrissey, modest mouse, and built to spill. if you came over i would bet lots of money one of those bands would be playing.
