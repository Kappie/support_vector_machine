Which means that the following post, originally submitted to  urlLink Nabokv-L , a mailing list about Vladimir Nabokov (see original message  urlLink here ), is somewhat on-topic today:  "I'm sorry to bring too much of Joyce to this list, but this is so good I simply can't help it. Dale Peck talking about Nabokov's later works or about Ulysses (by the way, next Wednesday is the centenary of the Bloomsday) is pretty boringly courteous if compared with this kind of criticism on Amazon.com:   'Joyce is blind in one eye because he read Ulysses and then the eye hung itself,' writes Ben Kharakh. 'I'm contemplating traveling back in time and murdering James Joyce, in the face...For Ulysses to be any worse of a book, it would have to break into your house and defecate on your bed.'"  Happy Bloomsday!   Update : I have been contacted by the author of the amazon.com review and asked to correct my attribution of the review.  Done!
