I get a limo that takes me around town to icecream shops and wacky carnivals w/clowns. 5.  All I can eat hotdogs. 6.  A movie trailor with a Canadian map on the wall and my points of attack marked in red. 7.  Name the movie.  "The Passion of Brad" and for the first fifteen minutes of the movie have a vietnamese whore beating off a dildo that is realistic looking and have a laugh track on. 8.  Just wait.  There are more.
