Not that it's that big of a deal, but on top of it I've got the move coming up, and the SAT (I'm not worried, Mom is), and the Grandparents visiting.  Today I cleaned the kitchen, and I mean cleaned. Stove drip pans were scrubbed, refrigerator and freezer were emptied and scrubbed, and various other things that make it look quite fab if I do say so. Also I've started to shop for a new Mac. My little sage-colored iMac is showing its age of 4 years. I've done a lot with his 450 MHz G3, but Mac OS X 10.3.x is the highest it will probably ever run, and the 20 gig hard disk is filling up.  So, I'm looking at the eMac. It's cheap but powerful. The one I'm looking at is a 1.25 GHz G4 with CD/DVD burner and I'm upgrading the hard disk to 160 GB because I plan on doing some video editing on it. Nothing big, just some home video and projects, plus DVD copies of shows I get from TiVo (when I finally talk Mom into it). It's seems like a big purchase (the Digital Video camera I'll buy later), but all in all the computer will be less than the cost of my iMac. Kinda sad how prices work, isn't it?
