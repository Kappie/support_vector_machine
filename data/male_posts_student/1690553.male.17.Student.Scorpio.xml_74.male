Don't forget Tarawih Paryer too. We have apprentice Hafiz Imams from Sg. Karang to lead the prayer. Most probably the first and the last time I'll have Iftar at my school.     Some of Form Six Brothers      Form Five Girls       'Makan Suap'       Tarawih Prayer      Ta'alim Session After Maghrib      Our New Bus!
