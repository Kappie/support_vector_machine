So, that's that.  My 100th post will come tomorrow morning, before the hurricane comes and attacks The River.   Tonight, I'm going to read some of The Lord of The Rings.  Because of my extended weekend, I do have to read the pages in Economics that were assigned, and also do the Spanish homework that was assigned today.  Then, I'm going to read The Lord of The Rings, and hopefully get through a good part of "The Fellowship of the Ring."  It's a really good book, I haven't had much time to read it though, and, I'm definitely going to spend a good portion of this weekend catching up, hopefully getting through a lot of the introduction stuff.  After tomorrow morning, all blog posting will be suspended until after this thing passes.  I may not even have power for a while after the storm.  I'm not sure.  This is my first hurricane that's really going to hit us (there's been several threats in five years, but nothing that's actually gotten us).  So, we'll see how it goes.  It'll be a brand new experience for me.  We were under a tornado watch today, too, but, we didn't see anything come out of that.  I'm surprised they didn't call us into a warning situation, where they make us duck down into uncomfortable positions in order to somehow protect us from a tornado.  Hmmm...how is that supposed to work, anyway?  Well, hopefully this thing won't be as bad as I think its going to be.  Like I've said, it's the first time I'm going through it, and I'm just a little confused as to, well, what a hurricane actually does, but, I guess I'll find out tomorrow!  That's it for tonight, Bloggers.  Tomorrow, I'll get on with my 100th post, and then not blog again until the storm is gone.  Until tomorrow, buenas noches, folks!
