Any how, as I said, they went by pretty damn fast, it seemed only two days ago that I went fishing.... wait... it WAS only two days since I went fishing.  RIGHT NOW. I am being screwed over by my VD project. I've got a throbbing son of a bitch of a headache it is almost one in the morning. School is as usual boring and pointless. I am also suffering from bloggers block. I think I'm suffering mental constipation, a possible exlanation for why my head is killing me.  Karina... I don't know what her problem is, but all my feelings for her have gone, but a tinge of regret still stays, WHY DIDN'T I DUMP HER EARLIER? Ah well. I'm not some player or sex god, but I needed to break away from her. Anywho, how wierd does the last day of the holidays felt? ( I know my tense is all screwed up, but I can't be fecked). It's like enjoying your last meal before execution (a brilliant analogy by Bill Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes.) I don't seem motivated to write anymore, I've picked up my classical guitar and right now I am trying to master the mid section of classical gas. I've noticed my technique has improved...  sorry to cut this short, but I'll being ushered of the comp due to a mother of all migranes.  Cheers,  Colin.
