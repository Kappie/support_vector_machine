Stuff to remind us of our youth in 20 years, wondering where it had all gone, as it leaves us crying on the inside.  Yes, now that that's over with...it was fun today.  There was an abundance of food and company.  Maybe too much...hmm...possible?  I've decided that I love those dots.  Forgot what they are called though...they help a lot with the flow of thoughts.    Joke of the day, week, month...it's so great, it's last forever:   What do you get if you cross Peter Parker with a Potato?   Answer:   Spuderman!!!   HEHEHEHE, yes, I know I'm sad.
