Now, that may not sound like much in the way of a catch-phrase, but for us it was "the signal." We were both single, and my friend, Wade, was kind of a wheeler-dealer. He always had some kind of deal in the works; a natural born salesman. The deal that made us the happiest was when he traded a few typewriters for a 16 ft. Catamaran. That's right - typewriters. Don't ask me how he did it, but it seemed like he was always pulling some kind of freaky deal like that.  That catamaran got a lot of use. It wansn't anything to scream about, it was old and beat up, and the hulls were sort of a bleached out vomit green color, and we had replaced the original trampoline with a blue one that just didn't look right, and she had lost some of her cleats and pullies but she was still water worthy and a hell of a lot of fun. Because she had seen better days we didn't mind abusing her a little. We referred to the boat as "The Chick Magnet." Every day during the summer was a potential day to sail and monsoon season was simply the best. If the wind was kicking up, I could expect a phone call. A typical phone call went like this:  [ring]  Me: "Hello?" Wade: "There's wind." Me: "On my way."  [click]  Then I'd get in my car and high-tail it out to Wade's house - I left my car stocked with all the supplies we'd need (swimsuit, towels, water bottles, sun-screen, hat) so I could go at a moments notice. At Wade's house we'd hook up The Chick Magnet to the Battle Wagon (neither of us had nice cars - me with a Dodge Omni that I paid $250 for and Wade with a Ford Ranger with just primer for a paint job that I'm pretty sure he paid about the same - we were living the high life) and head for Lake Plesant.   Once at the lake we'd hit the water and just sail around till it was too dark to see. Wind in the Arizona hills around Lake Plesant is a strange thing, it circles and swirls and only occasionally do you get a nice strong breeze that is in a consistent direction. Those were the winds we wanted, and they would usually only last for a few minutes so you had to stay sharp and really grab a hold of them as quickly as you could.  But really - it didn't matter. If we had wind it was just a bonus. It was simply exquisite to get out there on the water and enjoy the peace, grace and beauty of wind-powered propulsion. The smallest breeze would push us along and we'd tool along fast or slow depending on what mother nature decided to give us that day. We always understood that we were experiencing something extrordinary and rare that not very many people have an opportunity to experience.  I'm happy to be maried and have a son and another on the way. But sometimes, when I think back on how darned much fun it was to just take off and hit the lake in that boat, I have just a little sense of loss at the freedom that being young, single and having no responsibilities can bring.  Of course, that was one of the few aspects of being single that had any merit. But it was a lot of fun.   UPDATE:  apparently others have noticed a  urlLink similar trend .
