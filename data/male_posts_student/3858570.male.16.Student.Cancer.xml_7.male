Anywayz she says ok mom is gonna meet us at the mall. So im like ok lets go we get there and she gives me a 20 and says go buy ESPN Football and I was like Hell yea! so i come back down where Old Navy is and i got a Shit-Load of clothes.    That alone took like 2 hours and man wouldn't you know it we went for a luch and a resturaunt called "Lone Star Grill" and damn was it good i had a big-ass prime rib w/ a Ceasar Salad, Loaded baked potato, Holy Shit that was tasty. I get home pop in ESPN and i play that for like 4 hours straight. I know what your thinking "4 hours straight!?!?!" thats not special, Well for me w/out anyone bothering me for 4 hours its special.    So then my cousin stops by and we eat a bit of cake my sis. got me and we go see Anchorman, which wasn't a bad movie at all it had a few good and bad moments but if i had to rate it id give it a 3/5.    Anywayz this birthday was just how i would like all my birthdays to be, nice and simple and maybe a piece of cake :)    Great Day!
