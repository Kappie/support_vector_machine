And I can kick all of y'all asses  Wee...Fun I'm going to find Garrett and Parker then you can come and take all of us on at once, won't that be a bottle of joy!  ! Hahaha. Hey you guys should call my sister Power Wheel...cuz it's funny. Haha ok I'm gonna post now!    Edit: I'm putting both messages from her into one. Also note that everything in italics and bold are edits to make this message funnier    Paula's cool sister again.  HEHEHE ya cool.  I forgot to say something. JUNIORS  DON'T  RULE  NOTHING WE ALL SUCK!!  ! And if you ever say anything other than that..well you'll have a bunch of people on your tail  Meh...I'd love to see that!  . But seriously. You should respect your elders  So I assume your old and wrinkly  . Paula just said are "smart people" UH REALLY SMART so I don't see why you wouldn't think that Juniors rule. Now she's scowling at me. But it's her own fault for letting me add a post. So there! And now she's whining because she didn't want to be admin. But make her do it forever 'cause that would be funny. And for now, all I have left to say is that I know you guys wish you could be as dumb as me but don't worry. You will be when you're a junior. With age comes wisdom and beauty and lots of pimples. Peace out
