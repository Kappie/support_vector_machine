Well the proposed idea of a 30 minute jam session by myself turned into a 30 second one......ending with my high tom's drumhead being BOKAN! Yes......this shows that I've had my drum set for  a while now lol.....well...now I gotta spend another 30 bucks buying a new drumhead. Whoo. Yes something somewhat out of the ordinary that happened today.......why couldn't it have been a positive thing!?
