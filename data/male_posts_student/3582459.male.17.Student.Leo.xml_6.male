One of the biggest stumbling blocks in my faith up until a few months ago was my fuzzy definition of faith; I wasn't sure if my faith was deep or believing enough. This was partly because I had only been a Christian for a few years and was thus unsure of myself, and was also because of a weird example of faith: God eminently exists just as a chair eminently exists, so one's faith in God should be as taken-for-granted as having faith that one's chair will not fall apart upon one's sitting down in that chair.  Basically, I had trouble taking for granted God's existence and provision; I expected that believing in God was an emergent truth from observation. Since I wasn't as confident about my faith in God as I was about my faith in my chair not falling apart, I seriously questioned myself, which was sort of good.  A few months ago it occured to me that having faith in God does not necessitate one being confident in him in the same way one is confident in a chair.   Exodus (particularly Exodus 4): When Moses was first starting out as a leader, God told him to go lead the Israelites who were slaves at the time, and that he would provide Moses with the necessary speaking skills  Moses replied that he wasn't much of a speaker and generally doubted his ability to lead the Israelites, even though God had told him directly to do so and that he would provide him with whatever was necessary. God responded by scolding Moses, who ended up leading the Israelites out of Egypt, parting the Red Sea, and the rest is history. Here, I see that Moses doubted; I see his faith wavering a little bit. Indeed, when he first started talking to the Israelites, it's very possible he was scared and unsure of himself even though God had told him directly to do it. What's important here is that even Moses, one of the great men of faith in history, had doubts about God, who was in some ways more eminently real to him than to us (that is not to say that we today can not have faith like Moses did). He showed his faith by ultimately doing what God told him to do, even though he had personal doubts--indeed, when Moses first started out, it seems that he wasn't as confident in his faith in God as he was in more mundane things.   Acts (particularly Acts 6-7) When Stephen presented his defense of Jesus and of himself to the Sanhedrin, it never once says that he spoke without stuttering a little bit or being afraid (indeed fear would be reasonable as he was martyred). It never says that Stephen spoke with complete confidence and had and absolute command over fear or doubt; it just says that he spoke. This is stretching beyond the passage, I know, but it seems quite reasonable to me that Stephen was afraid here, that Stephen could have been completely unconfident about Jesus here. But again, I see a man overcoming any and all fears and acting in a way that was according to God's will.  In both Moses and Stephen, I see an overcoming of doubt followed by acting according to God's will. I do not see senseless, take-God-for-granted actions. I see force of will overcoming doubt--the quintessence of faith.
