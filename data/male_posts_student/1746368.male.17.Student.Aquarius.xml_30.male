Only one is better than this one, and I can't use it since it costs money to join, or if you get a code from a friend, which I can't (yea, it's Livejournal). I really want one that can show what the mood is with a little smiley face. I think those are nifty and easier to use. I found one that uses those, but it is very formal and not very good. I think I will do what I did above and just live without the little smiley face. I shall post in the morning, or late afternoon tomorrow. Good night everyone. Don't forget to put out any fires you may be lighting before going to bed.
