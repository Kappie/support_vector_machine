The courage 2 take responsibility, the courage 2 admit 2 your lover that you are wrong. the courage 2 reflect on what you did wrong and learn from it and the courage 2 be forgiving.  Not saying u should always take the blame but have at least the courage not 2 always blame your partner in the relationship for everything that goes wrong.  Sometimes reflect on what you did wrong first, maybe its something you did wrong that triggered ur partners reaction in a negative way.  The courage 2 stand up this is mostly directed at the female counterpart in a relationship.  Guys get addicted 2 sex and so do some females but eventually the female wants no more and thats the time u stand up and tell ur male counterpart no more enough is enough.  Forgiveness is a crucial part in any relationship, and having the courage 2 do it will get u places with your partner.
