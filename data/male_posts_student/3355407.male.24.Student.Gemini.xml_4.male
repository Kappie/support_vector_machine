As I watched the memorial service on TV this morning of President Bush adresssing the survivors and liberators I began to think what an insurmountable debt I owe them. I also am saddened about the death of former President Regan as well. It has been 60 years since D-Day and I wonder how few of those great men will return in the following years. Their contribution to our society is one that none of us will ever be able to fully understand nor repay. President Regan likewise signaled a shift in the direction of American culture and brought us back from a cycle of self-pitty and anger that could have destroyed everything we are. So it is that with his passing I reflect on his philosophies and gain a better understanding of what is in the future. Major chapters in world history are closing as then men and women who lived through them began to finish their time with us and for many of us comming of age today new chapters are being written by us. Let us remember the lessons learned, honor the past and pray that we might be noble as they.
