I would put up lyrics, but almost all of them carry the same "I'm sad that what we had is gone" message, which is true, but a bit played out, you know?  Its strange that such an emotion influences so many songs to be written, really.  Its hard to deal with, a situation where you care deeply about someone, and think odd things, and then it can't continue on.  Ah, its hard to explain, but its not hard to convey, whoever gets it, gets it.  Grin and bear it, I guess, because life likes to play these little things.  I know that everyone has a purpose, and I can only think of a few short term ones.  If, over time, I do realize what their's really is, I will be happy.  Until then I guess I will feel somewhat sad.    Moving on is a simple thing, but what it leaves behind is hard (-dave mustaine) One thing left behind in me is a serious doubt in myself, its probably unfounded, but I still feel it anyway, because I never can really know for sure, enough.  I need that reassurance that something good was there.  I know, it was, but its like I need to be reminded that without feeling wasted.  Why?  Its one of my little idiosyncrasies, I guess, and I don't know how I'll get such assurance now without sending off that it still irks me.  Oh, see I just said that it still irks me, but it does.  I've got to confess it does, things like that will irk me, because now I can't talk on that level with you without conveying a sense that I still want something.  I should just break off, but its as though I don't want to, underneath.  Thats painful, it is.  I've got to move on.  I can't be so attached and caring, even though they are good qualities at times.  Better than being distant and uncaring in a relationship, that is.  I let those things(caring, clingyness) blind me though.  Sad.  Odi et amo, quare id facere forasse requiris...Nescio, sed fieri sentio et excrucior. Forsan miseros meliora sequentur.  I hope thats true.  But I doubt some things can be better.  Maybe this is one of those things that will get noticeably better, though?  Maybe I should just stop before I go too far.  Yes, thats a good idea.    Why do I only find peace in sleep?  I guess its just that my imagination can run wild and can feel unfettered by normal bounds.  Its when I can only rest and not think about what has happened that day, or week, or ever.  I can just vaguely concentrate on a few unrelated thoughts without any consequences for a few hours.   Why, why anything?  Why this, why that, does anything have a reason that I can understand now?  Or is it just another time thing?  Didn't I say I should end this?
