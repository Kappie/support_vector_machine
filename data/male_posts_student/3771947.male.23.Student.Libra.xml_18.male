It is a duality, the most wonderful feeling in the world and when it goes bad; it is the greatest pain a man can endure. When someone is in love they yearn, they need their love like food, it keeps them alive. The worst feeling in the world is to have that not returned. It hurts more than any physical pain that can be felt. It consumes every thought. For me, it's in the stomach, like a man grabbing my insides and twisting them over and over again until all I feel is pain. It feels like something is trying to get out of me, yet all it manages to do is claw my insides. When that feeling subsides, I am left with no energy, the feeling leaves and it takes part of my life force with it. I am left a baby, crying to be held or touched, to feel loved once again.  Love - the world cannot function without it, yet it causes so much pain. It seems God levels every scale of life. Yin and Yang.  Today I had an epiphany. There are very few times in my life where I learn such lessons. I grew today as a human. I realized what love is and what it feels like, I never knew before today what love meant and what it is to love. I can see love. Maybe because of my childhood it took me this long, but today pieces in my life came together and I can see the big picture now. Today was a milestone. I often wonder if others can understand what I think about, to many I probably seem like a psycho, babbling about nonsense. Intelligence is a curse, it is a responsibility. I wonder what others lives would be like if they knew what I know, if they could feel like I feel, if they could see what I see.  "Perfect love is rare indeed - for to be a lover will require that you continually have the subtlety of the very wise, the flexibility of the child, the sensitivity of the artist, the understanding of the philosopher, the acceptance of the saint, the tolerance of the scholar and the fortitude of the certain."  urlLink  - urlLink Leo Buscaglia
