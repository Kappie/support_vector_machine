I thought I would do a little research into the wonderful world of beer. I found a great website that ranks beers (I think B told me about it the other night) called  urlLink Beer Advocate.com .  I've been a bit poor for the last 23 years of my life. My more recent dealings with poverty have driven me into the realm of drinking Southpaw Light, which is just about the best cheap beer out there at $5.99 a 12-pack (in bottles, at that).  Here are some beer scores that my research has uncovered:  Sam Adams Boston Ale - 86 Sam Adams Boston Lager - 85 PBR - 75 Schlitz - 75 Miller High Life - 74 Southpaw Light - 73 Steel Reserve (211 High Gravity)- 71 Schlitz Malt Liquor Bull - 68 Budweiser - 67  How, in the name of Eberhard Anheuser  Adolphus Busch, did Budweiser score lower than PBR, High Life, Southpaw, Steel Reserve, Schlitz, and even Schlitz Malt Liquor Bull? Wow people have some bad taste...literally.  PBR is almost undrinkable, even for my poverty-stricken beer-loving taste buds. Steel Reserve? It's one of the most unpalatable brews my taste buds have ever had the displeasure of experiencing! And High Life? The champagne of beers? I don't think so, Tim.  Anyway, interesting stuff there...yet, at the same time, perplexing.  (And for the part of me that longs for England:) Belhaven Scottish Ale - 85 Guinness - 85 Bass Pale Ale - 83 Old Speckled Hen - 82 Boddington's Pub Ale - 80 John Courage - 79 Stella Artois - 79  Old Speckled Hen does not taste good from a can in the States. It just doesn't. On tap at the Turf Tavern pub in Oxford, England, however, it's awesome. All of the others I listed are great on tap there, too, but many of them are actually drinkable in America.
