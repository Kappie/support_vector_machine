No colours yet, and no idea when Iggy is going to buy the fucking clothe. John told me yes, when I asked him whether can he come on Saturday yesterday. And last minute, he fucking told me "I'm going for movie tomorrow" I really got fucked up and upset. I can't find anyone to help, I mean, I don't have enough people, WhaTever! I'm so..whatever lar.. I can't stand it anymore.. Why on earth is everything going upside down. Fucking Gana promised to show us the bloody color sample, and he forgot it. Bloody bitch santhi shows her face, telling us she wants to cost to be the lowest and the best quality, come on lar, fuck, which century are you stuck in?? I'm tired looking at your fucking bloody bitchy face, and pretend to love you so much. On the way back, John was holding my bloody key, and then I tried to tell him how upset I was, because I thought sOMEONE is helping me, but ended up, telling me he is going for bloody movies. There goes. "You promise me to help me, and now, you said you are going for a movie" "I did not promise." says him. FUCK IT! I hate listening to his sentence, every word and every sentence he said pissed me easily. I said "fine" and there he goes with his fucking apology. I'm so sick of it!! He kept apologizing and answered every bloody question with a fucking "okies" DAMnIT LAR!!! I feel like crying!! I can't stand anymore.!!! Life is fucked up as usual and it will never be simple and happy. Maybe, I should throw bloody "happy" out of my dictionary, as well as "love", and let "evil" and "anger" replace it. I can't think. Feel like dying, yes, suicide can settle everything, but leaving other people to suffer. Yes, it is selfish and I'm running away from reality. Humans are borned to be selfish!! And running away from reality is my favy, so shut the fuck up. I've got enough. Everything fucked up my life. WHATEVER.
