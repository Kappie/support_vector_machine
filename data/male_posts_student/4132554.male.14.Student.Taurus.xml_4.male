I used the word "have" in the previous sentence cause there's no more unity. I don't know what happened to the usual chinese dismissal get together, or the usual Contry Chicken/ Chef's Delight saturdays.   Now, there's backstabbing, hating and I don't know if there are worse things in the classs happening that haven't reached my ears and eyes. I feel like going to the world war 3 everytime I go to school. What happened?   There's no one to blame, everybody has their own share of mistakes. I think that it is not too late to mend things up, its not too late to put things in the right order.   Think about it, we cannot live our three remaining years in high school like this..
