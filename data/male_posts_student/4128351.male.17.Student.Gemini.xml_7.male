They said I could order two pair of jeans for school, but Dad would have to put the new credit card number in the website, because if I saw it I would memorize it and buy stuff without their permission.        I must be a fucking thief to want clothes.  And bodywash... and toothepaste.  Evidently I'm some fucking bum because I just was informed that they already spent money on me today and I don't need anything else.  Well, hell,  everyone  needs toiletries.  Well, maybe not me, maybe I don't deserve them.  Forget it.        I didn't do anything today, sorry.  I went to Bob Evans and fought with my parents while my Grandma ate her chicken stir-fry.  What a lovely day.      I listened to  Parachute .  You should, too.        I raped Levi's get file on AIM and let a few random people rape mine.  It's all good in the world of file sharing and music.  I have over 135 full albums on my hard drive now.  And the great thing is, it's all been free.  I love the Internet.       I'm going to get rid of all the moose shit that clutters my new room.  I told Mom I didn't want to live in a Cracker Barrel.  I don't think she liked that too much.  You know, maybe if you wouldn't have spent so much fucking money on all those gay moose decorations, you could buy me a pair of jeans or two.  Now who really knows the value of money?      I'm sorry I'm angry and using profanity.  It's just fun, I'm sorry once again.       I'm sorry I keep apologizing.        I'm listening to a rare Ben Gibbard solo song, "A Lovely Affair".  It's great, his voice rocks and the song is very, very cool.        Me and Brice are going to go watch a movie or something.  I'll get off of here.      I really need to see you, to kiss you, to smell your skin.  I love you so much, I hope you love me the same.  I'm lost in my love for you, and I'll never find myself.  You're the greatest thing in the world.  I love you, baby.      Goodnight you stupid douches, I need some food, I've only ate once today.  Maybe I don't deserve food either, you know, food cost money.  Hell, I might just go kill my dog Max and eat him, that would be a free meal.  But then again, I might have to use the stove to cook him and then that would cost money to use electricity.  I quit.      Keep it real, I love you all... well, most of you.
