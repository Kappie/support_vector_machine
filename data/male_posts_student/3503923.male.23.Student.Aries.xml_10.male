       
      You’re with me on this hilltop We look at the spires toward heaven You’re with me beside the fire We burn the earth beneath our feet  You’re with me in the shed We fear not dark, the wasp’s sting You’re with me in my room We laugh at the coldness in Britain  You’re with me in my sleep We dream of all the wandering sheep You’re with me when I stand We rise together, to a free land  You’re with me on this hilltop I see the far I see the near You’re with me on this hilltop
