My actions have been unfavorable and my words hypocritical.  My mom and little brother are flying in today 'round noon and I can't wait to see them. I hear Kyle has a new girlfriend. Hard to believe he is a junior now. Wish I were there to spend more time with him.   I leave for Tibet in 4 days. Greece will follow and I'll end my voyage in England. Word to the wise: Never vacation in the summer time to any of the destinations I have chosen.
