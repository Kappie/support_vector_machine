Idk if I have the license to post the following quote, but Stephanie Kaplan heard it in MT, which I would have been at had I not been French.  It says "Coconut Girl" on Juliet DeFrancisco's bag.  Hiro: Why does it say "Coconut Girl?" Juliet: I think it's a reference to my chest. Hiro: Oh... wait, are they really that hairy?
