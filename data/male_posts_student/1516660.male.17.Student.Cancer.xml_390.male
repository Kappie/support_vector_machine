Polo Tee, I think) along with my blue trousers. I color-matched! HAHA! Crazy cat moi. Yes!   Okie. Today, something big happened! YESS! Koo Wen Qiang's right arm is in a cast. Or rather, a bandage. Whatever. He injured his right arm during PE today. Apparently, he was playing Netball when someone pushed him down because he was blocking that person. Yes. How complicated. His friend has to take him to the hospital. Ayioh. Poor thing right? Meow moo meow!  Okay. Today there are two Chinese events that must be celebrated! Number 1, my book review was praised! Weee! I am so happy. It is such a rare event that my Chinese work got praised. HaHa. He said I've written quite nicely, and said that I type better than I write. Heh Heh. He said my writing style is quite contemporary and it fits the modern times now. I am so happy. :)  Okay. After school there was this concert by the Chinese Department. Students and teachers sang Chinese songs for us. Even the non-Chinese teachers and students sang Chinese songs too. HaHa! I have really enjoyed myself there. :D   Right. When we are walking out of school, we spotted Gerald Ng walking with GuoHao and Grace. GH doesn't look entirely happy. Attracted by Gloria's and CQ's laughs about me (I was boasting about the Chinese book review to Gloria. HaHa!), he turned back and started walking with us. He thought we were laughing about him because he fell down. O.O Throughout the whole journey of walking to the bus-stop, taking the bus and going up the MRT station, I found out that his yi xin ping (suspicions-paranoia) is very heavy. When we are laughing or smiling, he thought that we were laughing at him. Then when I cleared my throat and went "hem hem", he thought I was laughing at him. O.O I think he finally knows that he is not really well-liked and is ostrasized. Poor thing leh. It's not fun being ostrasized, but...I can't click with him! What do you expect me to do? Pretend to be all fake and smiles around him? Okay la...as long as he doesn't go correcting my pitch, tone, tune, key and how I sing. :P   Heh. Yeah. Basically, that's my day la. Yeah. I think I am going off le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
