Don't beleive anything you read.  Alright then. Wednesday, I'm going out to the Plaze for a Chuck Palahniuk reading/book signing, and I'm pumped as hell. I've seriously never talked to a celebrity in person, let alone one who I admire. I'm going to pick up the hard-back copy of his new book  Diary  and have him sign it. Then sell it on Ebay for twice what I paid. Just kidding. I have to think up something cool to talk to him about...  In other news, I saw Matchstick Men today (don't ask me how, it just showed up on my doorstep). Awesome movie, everybody should check it out when it opens. Coolest ending since The Usual Suspects. Also, Nicolas Cage gives another great performance. That guy's on a roll (rent Adaption if you haven't seen it).  Check out my new piece at deviantART  urlLink here .  Bye.
