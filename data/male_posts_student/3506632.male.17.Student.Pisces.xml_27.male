Instead what we see is that our lower middle order gladly trudges along at six an over during the last ten overs giving us a miserly 257 as the total.    Later on, after all due respect to the Bangladesh openers, Inzamam went too late for the kill and too lightly. If you cant bowl out a team like Bangladesh in under forty overs, there is a fatal flaw in your claim "Bowling is our strength". An advice for the skipper, who most certainly wont be reading this, be aggressive in your approach on the field.
