Today I had an online conversation with an ex-girlfriend, who I haven't spoken to in several years. I made contact by email a few months ago, using a reunion website. It wasn't till today though that we had any real contact, other then forwarding each other joke emails as one more name in a distribution list. Today she was online, and we chatted for a while, and made a tentative arrangement to catch up next time I pass through where she lives.  Because of the way we split up, the way things turned out, I never really thought we would have contact again, it seemed as though she would never want to speak to me again. But it was all a long time ago, and I guess that it is true that over time things change. I'm glad that we're in contact again, as I've often wondered what happened to her, how she was doing. And I still have some apologizing to do, for my behaviour when we broke up.   I guess as I get a bit older, and dare I say, a bit wiser, I realise that the way I behaved in some situations was not the best. In a lot of cases I guess I will never get the chance to put things right, but where I can, I feel like I should.
