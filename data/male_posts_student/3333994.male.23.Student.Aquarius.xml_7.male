Some are challenges and some are human behaviors all, however, need attention to help promote a more efficient and better healthcare facility.  I have learned as I have written and have tried to explore the current mindset of this industry's workers to see which issues they feel are going to be important in the future.  Medical technology, electronic medical records, automatic dialers and staff motivation are the areas that I feel must be addressed in order to ensure that a company can meet the demands of its patients as well as move forward in terms of ability.  Through the use of better infrastructure systems, companies can be on the cutting edge of what medicine and healthcare has to offer.  This is important if a company wants to set itself apart from the competition and stay ahead of the curve.  In this time of shrinking reimbursements and talk of universal healthcare, the suggestions I have made do not always work financially for every entity.  However, the blueprint provided in these blogs is the ideal that companies should strive for.  I plan on consulting after I have enough experience in the field and will attempt to get the point across about the benefits of updating a facilities infrastructure to handle more complex tasks.  Once these improvements are made companies will begin to see the promise of new medical technology: A better and more healthy tomorrow.
