" hey.. what attitude is this.. then you might as well quit poly" ya. she is right. what attitude is this. why am i making myself sad, when i dun even know if someone cares? she didn't even bother to reply when i say i love her. am i saying it too much? then i dun say. it's already 8.47. and i have no sms from her. no call. should i worry? is she with alvin? haha. i think i am getting crazy. or she wants me to sms her, just to just ignored? i dunno what she wants. i dun even know if she wants to break up with me or not. or, if her mum really dun wan us to be together. or she wants to break with me to be with someone else. i'll never know. and even if it's true, she won't tell me. worry worry worry. am i becoming a worry rat? haiz.
