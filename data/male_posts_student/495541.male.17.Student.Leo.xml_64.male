Anyways, tonight was our first game.  We lost.  I'm not sure what to say, really.  I didn't do as well as I wanted to.  Somehow the o-line managed to do a good job.  Only 3 sack/knockdowns total.  At the half, we were only down by 7 if I remember correctly.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.  I figured we'd pull off the win.  Apparently not.  We made some silly turnovers.. and da da da.. blah blah we ended up losing.  We had our little moments, but they seemed to have more moments than us.  So, our season begins with a loss.  Such a horrible thing, but we're going to bounce back on Monday and be better than ever.  Nothing else to say.  Good night.
