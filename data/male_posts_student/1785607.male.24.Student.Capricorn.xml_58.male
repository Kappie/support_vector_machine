I got exams next week, but I don't know about what... One of my classes is in the morning and lately I have been sleeping a lot, a lot, so I just don't go to it ( now is my second week not attending )... In other classes I just don't pick up the papers to study... so I'm flunking... Is so not me. And I am getting scared because of it.  Family, for the moment I just don't seem able to spend some time with them alone. I just can't. More in the fact that my mom knows I'm gay than in the fact that I am somewhat depressed. As I have said, she wants to talk to me about him, but I don't want for her to hate him... dunno why... So I am hiding from her. Maybe that's why I spend so much time sleeping.  The only thing good that came out of it is that I did lose weight, and two pant sizes. For the fact that I cried like a baby without his mum, I drank a lot of water and as a result, my skin looks actually good. I fit now in my skinny jeans...!!!
