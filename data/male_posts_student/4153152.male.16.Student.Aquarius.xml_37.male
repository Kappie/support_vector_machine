I recieved my replacement hard drive today, and I've been doing all that's associated with a clean load of Windows for the past.....oh I don't know.....five or six hours. And I still haven't loaded any games. I've been transferring over files from other hard drives, installing miscellaneous programs like crazy, and trying to geteverything configured.On top of that,I had to install XP twice, thanks to Norton Ghost. It's a wonderful product, but if there was ever something that could screw you up, Ghost is the program.  Other than that, I playeda great game of Battlefield Vietnam earlier today with my good buddy Wingman. We played on some EAUK server, it was lacking in retards and we both had smooth pings. We played across probably 4 to 5 maps, and had a total blast. I can't wait to install it and get back to playing.  Back to my job issues, I have almost finished my job app to Safeway, I just need some info from my W-4. As soon as that is done, I will try to talk to my boss about leaving. I want to just say screw it, I'm done to him, but I feel bad about leaving. Kind of like I'm cutting him off at the knees. I'm not sure, but that probably isn't how a 16-year-old secondary tech should feel. If you've got some kid doing much of the work at your computer store, maybe it's time to switch things up a bit. In any case, I can't stay there any longer. I hate my co-workers (Well one of two, anyway.), I have an enormous amount of job stress, and I can't do all the work that's being handed to me. Oh, and I dont' make very much money. At Safeway I'd be working more, but I'd also be making lots more money. Then I can actually save for college, rather than say I will.  I'll be working tomorrow, so I'll probably find the time to slack off enough and make a post. Either that or type up a rant tomorrow evening. I guess we'll just go with the flow.
