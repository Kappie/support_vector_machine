It was alright... when I sobered up... I started getting really bored. So I started a mosh pit with Jeff and some others. Then I was crushing beer cans on my head. When I get bored... I always get lots of stupid ideas in my head.   Yesterday... I did very little. I managed to squeeze in 30 pages of reading and start a painting though... but I slept most of the day and sat around on online most of the day.  WWE is in town today, but I'm not going. Money is the reason. I wish I could go downtown and wander around to see if I can run into Goldust or someone... that'd rule!  ***
