Over the past few years a group of teenage yobs have been bred as the result of poor parenting and lack of discipline. The so called "Townies" recognised by their uniform of tracksuits, carbrini hoodies, burberry caps and thick fake gold jewellry known as "bling" are a public menace that could easily be stopped if they was some form of effective laws in this country. Because of this plague on our streets myself and others have decided to form a group to combat townies (also known as Chavs, Kevs, Scallies, Neds and Charvers) if you want to know more then join the forum and post your queries. Townies should be warned of GOATs (Guild Of Anti Townies).
