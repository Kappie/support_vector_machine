I am working with the  urlLink General Social Survey 1997-2002 Codebook  in trying to figure out what kind of people draw negatively from religious coping.  I can't post my variables, but go in there, play around a bit, and see if you can come up with something.  And NEVER tell a graduate professor that you can write a stats-based paper when your life in the field consists of a general course where you dicked around with a calculator and booted up SPSS once or twice.    JOB SEARCH UPDATES - Things started off with me casting my lots and moving up to Northern California, where I would rule the surf and women through charm, wit, and uncanny ability to reference episodes of Perfect Strangers.  But money got in the way, so to San Diego it was!  But money is still in the way.  Grad students just can't really save money; you get some cash for school, and some loans to pay for the semester, but once the semester is up, that's the end.  Somehow I've staved off enough food and necessities to where I can pay for most of the month of May, but after that I'm greasing in shitter's canyon.  So I'm looking at the dirty Arkansas for two months; get a decent job, make some decent money, pay little or no rent, and hang out with some folks I haven't seen on a day-to-day basis since 1997.  Can my name and clout as Rogers' most eligible High School Student (1996) get me a job teaching writing at NWACC?
