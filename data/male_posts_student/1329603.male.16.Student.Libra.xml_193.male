    
       Recently a lot of people have called me "hot", "cute", "sexy", or "sweet". These are all entirely complimentary as far as I can see. However I'm inclined to doubt the opinions of the people who have commited themselves to such a statement. Nothing that has happened tonight has spurned this, it's a lack of belief in what people say positively to me that has been nurtured by years of sarcasm directed at me. I find myself in a fight against myself and neither side can win on account of both sides being the same.  I'm not depressed, I promise. I'm... worried, I guess. I'm worried about me. I'm worried about the next month or so for me.  Love, Jon Roskilly
