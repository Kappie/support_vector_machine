Anyway, I have been in this game for quite some time. 3 Years i guess. Played ever since 3.1 or 3? That also means that Im good at that game yah?   Sadly no..-_- And Im telling you right now...The more i play the game...The more pissed I am...Reasons?  1 - Im in a clan at the moment. Clan Casium |[CM]| My nick is aHaH. Im not sure whether im considered a pioneer. but i understand the fact that i USED to be one of the best in the clan. But thats the fucking past yah.Now im more like a fucking noob...And i dont really like that...My new members are fucking better than me...And im telling you.My loyalty seems to be drifting away from the clan...  2 - My own temper itself...Is causing me to hate the game. I never like to my friends to kill me in the game itself { You dare to kill me in real life? I will fuck you Pop And Mum To hell }Even worst.I suck at taking shits from people man...As in all the morkery and stuffs...Just one crap alone.For instance "Ah yoh? Are you sure you're a SR? Even a fucking Noob like me can kill you? SO what are you now? A noob AS well? WHAHAHAHAHHAHAMUAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA. Opps? I had forgotten to spray your body just now....Sorry leh { spraying is thought to be offensive...Its like fucking your mom after killing your Pop }"  3 - Im getting pretty lousy these few days....Aint sure why? Most probably its my whining yah...Yah great.  4 - Fucking DoD communnity in Singapore is still the same 3 years back.Its small...The game is not really recognised man...So what if Im Good at the game? I aint gonna be recognised at all...So play what fuck?   5 - I dont wanna play too much games now...Im promised myself that im not gonna mess my life up anymore.Its a very Fuck-my-face-hard feeling...  Yah guess that these few are the MAIN reasons...Still have quite a couple... A note - Its not that i wanna be famous or whatsoever...Its just that Im a perfectionist.I get easily pissed when i committ a mistake...Fuck it..Furthermore, Im even worst than most of my members now.What the fuck is this bullshit?Hai~~~ the more shit i talk, the higher the temperature gets.....Soyanara...
