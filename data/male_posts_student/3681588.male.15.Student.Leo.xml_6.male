This is a game played in the whole world which task is to get the cordinates and a pictures of specific things (like a treasure hunt) such as a zoo, an eternal flame, a round building, etc., and depending on how hard it was you get points and stuff. It's pretty cool and the only thing u need is a GPS and a camera. If you want to check it out, click here  urlLink click here .
