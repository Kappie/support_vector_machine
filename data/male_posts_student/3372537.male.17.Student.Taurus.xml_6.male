I'm REALLY proud of me.  REALLY.  I kind of like my new color scheme.  It makes me happy.  You would not believe the evilness involved in picking a good readable font from my arsenal of fonts.  mwahaha.  That's another of my obsessions.  FONTS.  Come on, they're awesome.  I need food.  Oddly enough, there is food.  My mother makes the world's best chili.  Ever.  I'm going to go eat now.
