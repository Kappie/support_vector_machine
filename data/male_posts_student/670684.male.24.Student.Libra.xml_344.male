I've got to cut back on the coffee consumption, but...what are you going to do?  Driving over here, I realized that the sedentary lifestyle of the writer is a total detriment, because when I go to write, I often must have something with me to focus on when the ideas slow...internet, coffee, bagels, potato chips.  At least sitting out in what was once sun will help me lose the winter pale I took on after October.    Yeah, so I'm road tripping in a week or so.  I had the opportunity to Mardi Gras it this weekend, but a shitload of work to do kept me from it...granted, wherever I go I'm going to have to work, but at Mardi Gras I'd be relegated to a dirty hardwood floor in Matthew Philbrook's old Baton Rouge house, and then sitting to watch several ultimate frisbee matches for the weekend.  Love it, but not condusive to getting shit done.  And we probably would never hit New Orleans, which isn't so bad...to do Mardi Gras you've got to go with the right people and go at the right time.  Fat Tuesday is the right time.  Night of Bacchus is the right time.    I went five years ago...Sophomore year at the 'nary, with Chris LaBorde and Nick Pabst.  Fucking incredible, and ultimately depressing.  The trip started as a venture to Richardson with Katie, the second time I'd gone, and the first time we stayed up until dawn, making out on the couch in the living room, among other places.  It was Valentine's Day weekend, and I got her Mulan and something else...a lot of girl power stuff.  Up to that point, our relationship had been platonic due to a recent break-up of hers and her want for getover time.  It didn't make sense to me, because we were going out...I wasn't the guy pal who tagged along and loved the girl who doesn't love me...we were all about each other, stopping short of physical.  That Saturday was the end of platonism...and from there, we took the fuck off.    Anyway, this wasn't a memory of Katie, but of Mardi Gras.  And really of both, because Nick Pabst had invited Katie to Mardi Gras, which I wasn't really digging (maturity enables you to act in a similar fashion around buddies and girlfriends...at this time I lacked such maturity and initiative), but then realized how stupid an idea it was...stupid because taking a 19 year old girl to Mardi Gras for the first time requires a security team.  I uninvited her, which was cool with her, and after our venture in DFW, we headed to Houston to visit Beth, a girl Nick had pined for since high school, where he was the guy pal who tagged along and loved the girl who didn't love him.  She was cool, her roommate a precursor to many a sorority type I'd meet in Austin.    A dog on the deck above me just was just knocked from the table it was on by its owner, whose arm it was humping.    I don't really care about reliving Mardi Gras right here...I do wish I took more road trips such as that at this point in my life.  And as I sit, grading sitcoms, writing another step outline for Bob (the last one), and looping Baltimora's  Tarzan Boy , one of the great 80s new wave dance hits, I want to go somewhere new.  For a weekend.  Maybe a day or two longer.  Windows down, Baltimora on, books in tow.
