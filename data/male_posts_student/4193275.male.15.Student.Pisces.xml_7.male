The words of wisdom above are from Sunday Girl by Blondie - yep, further evidence of my  fantastic  taste in music.  Hmm, what did I achieve today... Said goodbye to my cousins, watched Curb Your Enthusiasm, got dressed, watched more Curb Your Enthusiasm, had lunch, read my book (some complete crap about a male prostitute, I only got it cos I liked the picture on the cover...oops, I'd better just clarify, the picture on the front was not one of a male prostitute, or anything male prostitute related, it was in fact a nice hot air balloon), watched  more  Curb Your Enthusiasm, spent lots of time on  urlLink www.snopes.com  .... yep, that's about it. Tomorrow I will  definitely  do something productive. No, I can't make any promises - but I will  try  to do something productive. Don't hold your breath though...  Hey, Where Does Our Love Go has the same tune as I Can't Help Myself! One of the bands should sue, although I don't know which came first, so I'm not sure which.  Fucking weather - it's been raining all day, yet I'm still forced to wear sunglasses if I want to sit outside, which is just  stupid . And also, how come it was hotter than the  sun  (tm Alan Partridge) the other day, and now it's like this? That's also stupid, stupid and  mean .  I just realised that I use bold and italics far too much in this thing, so next time I will attempt to get through a whole entry without using either. I may have to resort to using pretty colours instead.  Daniel
