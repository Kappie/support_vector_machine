Two big unit events just ended for me. It was both long and hard work, but I had off given to make up for the time put in. All in all it was not too bad. Come next week however it’s going to be a new ball game as we all go back to work with lowered manpower (lots of people clearing leave) and under new management. Wish me all the best people, have to make it through this month then I can start to clear my own leave. ORD Loh !! *grins*   >  Been reading a new hardcopy book lately. Picked it up a the second hand bookstore at Funan. For all those who think that I have been slacking off on the Sci-fi theme of this blog (and who find it an improvement), be warned. The hardcopy looks to be able to give me fresh ideas to use here. I’ll speak more about it at a later date/time.  Just be thankful all of you that I’m not a hardcore Trekkie, or this blog would read like a Federation Technical Readout or worse, be written totally in Klingon. I have yet to watch an episode of Enterprise as of yet. I better change that soon.  Speaking of Hardcopy, I just received in the mail my first textbook for my Info-Comm course. I can’t describe how excited I am to flip through it. This is totally my can of coke, I’m going to love studying for once in my short blip of a life. I just wish I didn’t have to juggle the time with going to work. I’m actually have to do two modules for my course and so I’m wondering what had happened to the other textbook. There is a chance that they use the same book because they are somewhat similar, but I have better check with them again.
