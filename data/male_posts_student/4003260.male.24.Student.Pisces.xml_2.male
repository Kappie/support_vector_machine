As the temperature was pushing 30 degree the bus ride to Swartz Bay proved to be less than comfortable.  For some reason – though I am sure there is a good reason – the air conditioning was only put on every 20 minutes and for no more than a minute or two.  What is more ridiculous – that the bus is apparently designed (or policy dictates) that the air conditioning can not be left on or that the bus has air conditioning?  It is a pampered lifestyle indeed when one can only find the lack of continuous air conditioning to complain about.  As usual, the ferry sailing over was gorgeous as the scenery is hard to match.  I spent the entirety of the trip lounging in the sun, soaking in the sights and reading.  Finished Animal Farm by George Orwell (highly recommended) and started Gulliver’s Travels by Jonathan Swift (a classic that has failed to capture my interest so far).  Jumped a few buses and eventually found myself near Granville Island with an expired bus transfer so decided to walk around the island.  All the shops were closed - it being close to 20:00 by this time - and I would have killed for an ice cream or a cold beer, though it is a bargain to give up the beer to have Granville Island without the usual overflow of tourists.    Eventually arrived at Gwen’s house for the evening around 21:30 where she promptly offered me a cold beer.  A better friend can not be found.  With hunger driving my thoughts we set off to the grocery store to find it well past operating hours.  A healthy dinner of a slurpee and chocolate bar followed.  With my stomach content, we sat down to watch “Bring It On” – a classic in its own right.  A night on the local playground with the conversation of good friends ended a wonderful day.  Enter Saturday and another brilliant ferry ride to bring Gwen and I over to Gibsons.  Gus meet us at the ferry terminal, we swung by his place to drop off our belonging, browsed Greta’s wonderful garden (a green-thumb indeed!), and quickly departed to see the Sea Cavalcade parade with its kids scrambling for candy, police and fire truck sirens, marching bands (including an accordion band), beautiful BC Ferries float, kids pulling tricks on dirt bikes over a car pulling a jump!, and the near unbearable heat of a summer day.  Truly something special about small town community spirit and Gibsons displays it well.  With hunger dictation our plans we headed off to the famed Gumboot Café.  All three of us invested in the Thai Noodle Salad though the Buddha Bowl appears to be all the rage these days.    After baking on the beach for an hour or two with the occasional dip we struck up a game of bouche ball and quickly learned Gwen is a seasoned pro.  Well, at least when she is playing with blue! The beach also made it clear to me why people invest in sunscreen.  Peeling away and having kids scatter in fear of catching leprosy is not the fun I imagined it might be.  We followed the beach with a hike up Roberts Creek - one of my favorite places on the planet.  Swimming in the cool, clean water under a brilliant waterfall leaves little else to be desired.  Gwen seemed to find a tranquil frame of mind there and I am enthralled she was able to make the trip if only for this one experience.  Made out way back to Mr. Guzek’s house and put together a Greek salad and barbequed some steak.  With the sun about to set we wrapped up dinner and headed down to the waterfront to enjoy it.  Perhaps the best beer I have had in some time.  The night was now upon us and the night brought dancing in the street as part of the Sea Cavalcade festivities.  Those who know me will know how dearly I enjoy a chance to dance.  With the band taking a short break, it was time to have a serious moment after this day of youthful adventure so Gwen and I ventured to roll down the library hill.  I swear it was not just me who failed to roll down in a straight line – Gwen was surely equally at fault!    We danced until the band retired for the night and walked home with dear Sarah whom had been MIA for most of the evening.  To our delight, the northern lights were plain to see.  After stopping to watch the lights for some time we made our way back to Gus’s.  I spent the next hour or so by myself enjoying the lights and life.  What a way to end the day.  Sunday brought with it Gus’s breakfast burritos, Ultimate, swimming at Trout Lake, and venturing through Greta and Jeff’s garden (two green thumbs are better than one).  The trip home was made far more enjoyable having Gwen’s company for the first half and Andrea’s company for the second and never have I been so thankful to be offer a car ride into town (thanks Andrea!!).
