I've always had this personality that I can look like that nothing is bothering me. I can swap stories with anyone and even try to be the lively one in a conversation. But this is sometimes just try to make noise cause when the silence comes, so does that sadness. Here recently, I've been having two basic emotional states from which to operate... sobbing and flat-lining. Either I'm so filled with sadness that I can't keep from sobbing or feeling the urge but no tears will come from it, or I'm unable to feel anything but empty.   I heard once 'fake it till you make it'. I think that's where I am. It makes life a little harder, maybe, because I'm still expected to do the things I'm expected to do, though the world does allow quite a bit of leniency. I'm still expected to tend to my duties. I'm still expected to be respectful. I'm still expected to function. Sometimes the functioning is the hardest part. Submitting, being respectful, tending to my duties... those are a breeze, compared to functioning.  I know there is a name for this, and I know that name is depression. I also know that most people who don't suffer with it won't understand. People will say 'Oh, he must not be happy” or, 'oh, he's not really a submissive there is something wrong.   People don't understand that depression is a chemical imbalance. It's not just an emotional thing. Emotions are chemical driven. Synapses fire in parts of the brain, chemicals are released, and you feel a certain thing. When that's not functioning properly, you feel things that aren't rational.  I've been depressed all my life, and mostly no one's really ever understood that about me. I had a teacher in my old high school who would lurk in her classroom door until I was passing and lunge out at me and say 'SMILE'. I finally told her that I would smile when there was something to smile about. And that's just it. There's not always a reason to be smiling. I have a neutral zone, and that's where I generally wait. When something happens that deserves a smile, I smile. When something happens that deserves a frown, I frown. Then I go back to my neutral zone. People don't get that. This teacher certainly didn't get that. She was forever hounding me to smile. She even went so far as to keep me from getting the 'congeniality' award because I didn't smile 'enough'. Every other teacher in the school wanted me to have the award, and she was on the award council, and vetoed it, so I didn't get it. I didn't think one thing about it until someone told me she was the reason I didn't get it. Then I was pissed, and certainly didn't feel like smiling.   I meet a girl who was always smiling. Whenever you'd ask her how she was, she'd beam 'fantastic'. The thing was, she often told me that she always answered that way, no matter what. Said she felt if she said it enough, it would happen. But with people like that, I feel like you can't truly trust them to tell you the truth, about more than just how they feel. You know, when I ask someone how they are, I want an honest answer, just like I do when I ask someone if an outfit looks right on me. Maybe that's where I'm different from most people though. Maybe 'how are you' is just lip service for the majority of the world. I don’t give the honest answers either. I wish to and in person I will but the net you don’t really know them, and I assume I will leave the façade.   I've been hospitalized, but I've taken different medications over the years. Never anything for long term, simply because circumstances tended to prevent that from happening, but I've been in rough spots before.   I feel like I'm just venting right now, and it makes me feel a little guilty, but I'm mostly doing a free thinking/writing/typing thing, and just letting it come out. I think that's what I need right now anyway.  I've started to notice that I have a tendency to try to save the world when I need to be saved. It's weird. When things get hard for me, I guess I try to distract myself by trying to take care of everyone else who's having a hard time. It doesn't work for long though, and I usually go overboard and deplete myself more, which just results in me being a basketcase. I could have gotten a lot done in the house in those almost three hours but I didn’t. My day would have been a lot less hectic had I just not done it.ger, stay strong a little longer, and will eventually help them live through their illness, into health.
