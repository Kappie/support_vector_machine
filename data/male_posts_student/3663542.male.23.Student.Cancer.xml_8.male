Stupid auto formatting was not allowing me to put the links in my favorites folder in the order that I wanted, but I beat it, and now its like I like... The secret was to remove everything from that folder and then return it in the order top down that I wanted it to appear. Sometimes I really hate when computers are smarter than they should be, like when you are on a login screen and you already have your name in and are 1/2 way though your password and then it decides you need to automatically be put on your name space, so 1/2 the password goes up before your name. Maybe its just me... Maybe its my computer, I probably need more memory, but then again don't we all. This brings me to what I really want to do... Build my own computer. Yeah yeah I really like my dell, but the challenge and coolness of making my own is very intreaging. I've been thinking about it and if I use bits of my dell it wont cost as much as I was originally fearing, however I would have to sacrifice the dell. But I could use the chip (a P4), and maybe some memory from this box, monitor (though what I really really want is a flat screen) and the cheap stuff like keyboard and such.  My dad got some beads, and we put together some komboulois (or Begleri to be technical) now I have a total of 7. The glass one chipped today, but I have a new favorite, one made with beads made of horn, just the string needs to be improved. Also he had the great idea that dice would be heavy and probably wouldn't crack, and yeah they work great, a little different being cubes though.  k time for some milk...
