I went back to England last week for three days which was excellent, essentially I went back for a HUGE party called the 'Final Fling' which is for all the finalists this year which included most of my friends and all the randoms that I generally meet when I am out on the lash!  Tuesday night was the warm up, which meant one thing and one thing only..............SUGAR!  Yes, probably the worst night club in the West Midlands (respect) was hosting its very own VodBull night which consists of paying a pound and receiving in return a small plastic cup containing a shot of vodka and a dribble of red bull.  It basically turns into carnage and I was all over the place which did not help the preparations for the next day!  Welcome back to English timing anywayz, thats all I can say, we had to be at the party at 6 on the Wednesday to start eating which was ridiculous!  Anywho, the night went on until three in the morning, so the sheer length of the night meant that I got drunk on three separate occasions and then sobered up!  They held it in a country house in the massive gardens, there were two huge tents with all sorts of great acts!  Ash headlined and then there were the Scissor Sisters, Amy Winehouse and Spooks too (pretty sure that most of you will never have heard of any of them as most of my friends hadn't but you will just have to trust me that it is a phat line up!).  There was also a full blown fairground with dodgems and everything (great picture of me, soon to come on Walker's website!).  Well, the hangover lasted longer than the night I am pretty sure!  The next day was a bit of a washout apart from watching England labour to a 3-0 win over Switzerland which was neither pretty nor entertaining....  Luckily we spanked Croatia on Monday!!!!!!!!!!!!!Woooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!! Quarter finals here we come!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So on my final night in Barcelona, I think I could well be down Scobie's for some pre-game drinking and keep my fingers crossed that I don't leave completely depressed!  It is gonna be a very good game I think, keep your eyes peeled for the young man, I think his name is.....  ROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONALDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Had my final exam this morning in Marketing Internacional and it was a typical ESADE joke, started half an hour late, only took 50 minutes of an hour and a half, piece of piss ;op  so I am as free as a bird (until Monday when I start work!) and may well go and burn some euros down Passeig de Gracia this avo...  Hope everyone is keeping well, I may be able to get Steffen blogging soon so that it won't be such a close knit club!  Funny story, saw good old Marta in the Sports Bar last night watching the Italy match, it is a small world I tell ya!  Ciao for now,  A
