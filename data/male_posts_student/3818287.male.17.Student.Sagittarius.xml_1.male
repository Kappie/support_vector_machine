Makes you think twice about things and really wonder "What am I going to do with myself after high school?" Growing up is a bummer if you're not having fun. So that's what I'm doing. Playing the cards I've been handed. And lately, I'm not doing too bad. Now, I don't want to bore all of you with stories of my love life (or lack thereof), but this is my blog so you have no choice. Well my lady friend came over last nite. She was supposed to work till 9 but got off early so I bought a pizza, picked her up (two hot things in my car at once!), and we came back to my hizzle. After chowing down a couple peices of pizza and watching an episode of Simpsons, we popped in a movie. I'm no dummy so of course I chose a scary one, 28 Days Later. Weird movie. Good, but weird. And then when the movie was over, we went outside and laid in my hammock. It was so romantical, my neighbor's dog barking kind of took away from the mood. And I know I'm going to catch a lot of crap for this but I didn't kiss her. I know I could've, maybe even should've, but it was so nice just cuddling. She's very comfortable :) I guess I'm just a wuss or something, but I want to make this last. I don't want to rush into anything and end up ruining it, because with my luck, that's almost guaranteed. I don't know, I've only been had one "girlfriend" before and she couldn't even compare to Kadey. How I managed to get her to like me is beyond me, but I won't complain. It just so confusing but wonderful to be in love. The feeling can't be described. I guess it's as simple as saying I'm in love. I really think I am. I just hope she likes me half as much as I like her. Well, all of you out in TV-Land, wish me luck!  Chris
