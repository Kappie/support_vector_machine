He ships off to basic this Sunday, but because I will be in the OK state I cannot say by later. I will miss him because of the sheer energy he brought to those around him. When he was in a good mood everyone around him was giddy. He also was the only friend I have ever had that has had a healthy romance with anyone that consisted of both a purely physical lust and a deep caring for each other. If I had to have a roommate at the cabin that was not some very attractive maid that wanted to keep the place tiddy everywhere but my bed, it would be him. I made him mad at me once when I told him that I did not approve of his girlfriend, and he shut me out of his life for around a month. I was wrong about that and wish I could truely make him see that I know that... I will miss having you around because you made me a different person that I liked. I will miss you Mr. Eric.  ...Anyway, I celebrated my friend Wheeler's b-day today. We got some movies that I know he will love and had some good eats. I hope he had a better b-day then he might have without me. He is going through alot right now.  I also bought some black fingernail paint today.
