It makes my everyday chores harder accomplish and it's screwing up my love life. I'm sorry [you know who] for not trusting you before. For thinking you would go behind my back. I should have known better that your not like that. Every one always say I'm a nice little boy, but how nice am i if i couldn't even trust my own girlfriend. I feel so ashamed and aweful. I don't know how to make it up to you except say that I'm sorry and that from now on things will be different. I trust you 100% and always will. I hope you can forgive me. luv ya  catch you cats on the flip flop later
