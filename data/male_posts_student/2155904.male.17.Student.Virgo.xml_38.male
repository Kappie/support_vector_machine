Skippy, Tyke, Macaroon, and Samantha worked together for theirs.  It was wicked awesome but then it fell apart so they scratched that and just made a swimming pool filled with frosting and little bits of stuff.  Mmmmmm...frosting.  Soooo good.  After that Tyke went to Farget to get his mom a Bette Midler CD.  Probably not the one she wanted but that is the beauty of returns/exchanges.  Well then he got home and then it got gay.  He did absolutely nothing all night except for play Madden for a little while.  He then got so bored that he studied for math!?!?!?!  What the hell is wrong with him?  Why would he do that?  Well then he popped in the Phantom of the Opera CD.  That was such a cool opera/musical/whatever it technically was.  Like the chandelier falling was wicked cool.  He was only like 8 when he saw it but it was probably cool anyway.  Classical music is way underrated also.  Like there is tons of music that is very very good but people don't listen to it cuz it is classical.  Cum on peeps, get wit it.  He also sometimes is in the mood to listen to Andrea Bocelli or Josh Groban.  One of the best songs, though, is Pachelbel's Canon/Kanon in D/Variations on the Canon.  When Tyke was 2 he would put on headphones and listen to that.  Then he would get a latil (sp) and close his eyes and sit in his rocking chair and pretend he was the conductor.  Those memories make him smile.  And how he use to call himself Fer-Fer because of the last part of Christopher.  And how much he loved deer.  Bambi was a great movie.  He had deer at his old house and he saw them frequently so he and his mom named them.  There was Spike, Faline, and Fer-Fer.  And the bears that came around would always eat the dandelions and then there was that time when there was a pheasant and his dog saw it outside and went berserk in the downstairs and just started running around and screaming.  And when he would tape songs from the radio and then make up dances for them when his extended family came over.  One time he threw off his hat into the crowd and nailed his aunt in the eye.  But she was ok.  Life really was simpler back then.  He worried more but that was just how he felt.  Little things would get him worried.  Like for about a week in elementary school he missed school and then the night before he was supposed to come back he got really scared about having to make up all the work he missed or not even getting a chance to.  That was just silly.  And relationships were simpler too.  Even though he certainly didn't feel that way then now he knows they were.  Like when he had a thing for Karla he would get sad when she didn't like him back.  Same for Haras but that was in 5th grade mainly.  He can still remember this one time when he told Haras that he wasn't going to like her anymore and she got happy and gave him a high five.  He felt really good about that and then when they were walking out to recess Tyke was walking with Stuart behind Haras and her friends and he saw her shoelace was untied so he told her.  And then she sorta snapped back "I thought you didn't care."  That taught him to speak to her!  Hahaha just kidding cuz Haras is one of the nicest people Tyke has known but she really did say all that to him.  Oh well, times change.  People grow.  People drift.  People grow closer.  People have a baby.  People grow closer to baby.  People grow up.  People grow apart from "baby."  People die.  "Baby" continues cycle.  (I have absolutely no idea what sparked those last remarks but whatever, I am crazy)
