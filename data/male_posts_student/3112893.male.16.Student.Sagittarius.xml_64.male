January 29th, 2004  An Ideal Morning  :-D... Finally.  This was a good morning. It's about time I had one of these. Perhaps I'll actually go out today without being forced. I love it when things like this happen. May the light of IllÃºvatar continue to guide me. 	>> meowMix  January 29th, 2004  When good days go bad!  How my good morning progressed...  Well, today didn't turn out as well as I would have liked. 6 hours went buy and i didn't get anything done except consume over 2300 calories and win 8 games of LA.  I'm gonna swear an oath to myself, and MARK MY WOR-R-R-S -- emm... there's no need, I forgot. They're already marked here so here's the oath. I swear to not play more than 22 minutes and 44 seconds of SC a day. :-P  But like most oaths that I swear to myself I will probably break it... :-\ I feel kinda doomed to this addiction. >> meowMix  That concludes this installment of 'Blast From The Past'. Check back for tomorrow's episode.  That is all. -- Feanor
