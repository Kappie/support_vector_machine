I will, don't worry: you'll still get to meet the fantastic people that make up Green Visions eventually; however, not in this update. Yesterday was Ottawa Day (July 15th, this update was written over the course of several days), and I feel that that supercedes Green Visions.   Ottawa Day. Our one day alone with the city. No direction, no strictly regulated time. Well, our time  was  regulated. It came in two blocks of two hours: one from 11am-1pm, and one from 4:30pm-7pm. But still... free time! It's something to be cherished here at Shad Valley, akin to the way a mother robin sits on her eggs. I'll start at the beginning of the day, though. No use in  beginning a story in the middle.   We woke up earlier than usual yesterday (well, I did anyhow). Breakfast ran from 7:30-8:00, with us leaving for downtown Ottawa at 8:00, in the hopes that we'd be there and organzied for 8:30. That went well enough. The bus ride was fun and full of energy, as bus rides usually are. I had my ska music (RBF!), so I was content. It was a little bit rainy, a little bit wet, but that didn't dampen our spirits. I tried to look appropriately touristy when we reached Parliament Hill. Some of the Shads had never seen the Parliament buildings before, so there was lots of picture taking and Oooing and Aaahing. As much as I mock here, they  are  impressive buildings, and always instill me with a very fierce patriotism everytime I see them.   We took the standard tour of the buildings. Red and Blue house split off to go with one tour guide, Green and Orange the other. Lisette, Luna and Melissa are all in Orange house, so I spent most of the tour with them. The most exciting part of the tour (I've done it 2 or 3 times before, and it was boring the first time) was at the beginning. Luna was joking about how they'd stop her and take her aside because she's a "terrorist" (her parents are both Indian). She went through security, then I did. As we were collecting our things on the other side I said, "oh, the terrorist detector didn't accidentally go off?" She laughed and said, "no." It was at this time that one of the scarier-looking security personel turned to us and said, "no jokes like that inside, please" in a very stern voice. Scared sheet-white, I nodded and managed to get out an "I'm sorry." One of the security personnel turned to me, smiled, and said (in a very warm voice), "don't worry, just don't do it again in there." Thank God for Canada. If I had been in the 'States,  I'm fairly certain I would have been nailed to a cross and placed out on the front lawn for vultures to pick at.   The rest of the tour was rather boring, as the Library is closed until next September for renovations/restorations. That's the only part of the building I really like; the smell of so many old books together is something magical. That, and the architecture of the building itself is something to behold: it's quite amazing, and I'm always slack-jawed everytime I see it.   After the tour of Parliament we had several hours of free time to ourselves. Since I've been to Ottawa several times before and have a pretty good sense of the downtown, I offered to take a group around wherever they wanted to go. We headed down to the March√© in the Rideau Centre. Crepes for breakfast/lunch are always a good choice, and I chose strawberry and apple with chocolate sauce on top. A good way to start the day.     Next we headed off to HMV. Not very exciting to some of the more suburban among the group, it was an absolute spiritual  experience  for the people from more rural areas. I think we spent about 45 minutes in there. I bought 4 CDs: the Billy Talent CD, Modest Mouse's  The Lonesome Crowded West , whatever The Mars Volta's CD is (De-loused in the Comatorium, I think), and the only CD they had in stock by The Soundtrack of Our Lives. All four CDs are most excellent, with TSoOL's being the best. I do like the Modest Mouse quite a bit, especially since I've been searching for that CD forever and was on the verge of ordering it from the Internet.   After that it was time to head over to the National Gallery. It was raining out, so we all arrived sopping wet. This was my... third time being to the National Gallery, I think. It's an amazing place to just sit. So very relaxing. Peaceful, if you will. However, peace and tranquility aren't part of the Shad work ethic, so we were off on a guided tour of the Gallery (not all of it though, and certainly none of the more interesting parts), and then we were receiving a landscape-drawing lesson.  The tour was pretty good. Our guide was rather knowledgeable, but it wasn't anything I hadn't heard before. I asked more questions in that 30 minute tour than I have in all the lectures and activities combined. Art's just my thing I guess, not business and science. I'll leave those things to the people who don't need beauty in their lives (hah).   The landscape-drawing lesson was also nothing I hadn't already learned/retained (which speaks well of Mr. Hanna's teaching abilities), so I pretty much just sat around listening to one of my four new CDs and trying to pretend that I was interested in what I was supposed to be doing. In the end the instructor told me I needed to use less gray. I suggested that I probably should have used white paper rather than... you guessed it, gray.   After that we were off on our own, and it was time for me to play tour-guide again. Since I felt like going to the By-Ward Market and that general area of town, I found a group that was headed in the same direction but had absolutely no idea of how to get there. The Market was fun enough. It's more of a place for girls, what with all the jewellry and clothes and fruit and such, but it's still an interesting place to be.   Angus and Rosie and everyone bought ice cream, but I wasn't really in the mood for that, so I headed over to the Beaver Tails stand. No trip to Ottawa is complete without a Beaver Tail, afterall. I bought a chocolate hazelnut 'Tail as a sort of... appetizer. This is where the party splits. Some people wanted to go explore the Market and Ottawa in general, whilst others wanted to get some food into them and have dinner. I was in the latter group. John, Steve V, Katharine and I all headed off in search food.   We were going to more in the restaurant/pubby part of town, when we saw a group of our friends (mainly from Orange house, those loonies) sitting down at the Hard Rock Cafe. Our taste in company overpowered our taste in food, and we decided to go sit down with them to a dinner at the HRC. Ottawa has several excellent restaurants; I know, I've dined at some of them. The Hard Rock Cafe is not one of them, not even by a long stretch. It's mediocre and over-priced at best, simply  bad  at worst. Still, we were with friends, so it was all good.   We payed our bills, took some pictures, and then decided to wander around the Market for awhile. First stop: Beaver Tails, for those who hadn't already had one. Many in the group were confused: actual beavers' tails? No, no. Just deep-fried batter with stuff on top. Oh, okay... Well that's fine. I'll take two.   There are almost always lots of buskers in the Market, and tonight was no exception. Particularly cool were two mimes pretending to be robots. All you had to do was put some money in their basket to activate them. We scrounged together about 5$ or 6$ and then watched them dance. They were quite good, absolutely incredible physical control and  concentration.   I then directed everyone to Sugar Mountain, the best candy store in town. Lisette was in search of gelato, since, being from Cape Breton, she doesn't have those fancy kinds of things. The gelato at Sugar Mountain is far from the best in town, but if you've never driven a car before then a Civic will suffice, so she was happy. Myself, I bought some Chupa Chups and some gigantic suckers (I think I was the gigantic sucker there though: they cost 3$ apiece!).   At that point it was time to head back to the Rideau Centre to meet up with the group. Seven o'clock rolled around, we loaded onto the bus and then headed to the Museum of Science and Technology. Having been there before, I prepared myself for a long sleep. The presentations there were long and boring.  After that we headed back to the bus, took and short ride home, and then promptly crashed.  I think my laundry's almost done drying, so I best be off now.
