I will miss my classmates and hope they will succeed in the future, which I know they all will.  Well today I went to the dentist and I have good news...  NO CAVITIES w00t!  Well for this time around anyway.  I feel that I might get another cavity within the next visit so I better start flossing.  Well, gonna see what happens tomorrow :-/
