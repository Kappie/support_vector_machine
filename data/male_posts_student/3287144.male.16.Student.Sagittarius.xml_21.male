Anyway, it's the beginning of the end today; Monday, the beginning of the final week at high school. I won't miss the place, in fact for the good part of this year I have been looking forward to it. Anyway, visit Slowly Downward [see link at the bottom], if you can 'get in' to it, then you'll find it very... interesting. Soon people will say that about this.  Music: U2 - When love comes to town Mood: Quietly optimistic. Site:  urlLink http://www.slowlydownward.com/
