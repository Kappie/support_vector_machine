For those of you who've been living under a rock, it's a really, really,  really  good show. Now in its eighth season, it still pulls in upwards of three million viewers a week. Not to mention it's already been on longer than any Star Trek series ever was. So somebody must like it. :)  Obviously, I haven't seen Atlantis yet, but since it shares the same writers as SG-1, it's almost certain to be excellent. It'll be on at 8:00 and again at 10:00. If you've never tuned in before, give it a shot.
