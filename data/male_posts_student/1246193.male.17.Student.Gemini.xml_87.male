Instead of your typical, obnoxious, blaring bell is started with a light show, sort of.   I am sitting a my desk enjoying the cahoots of Bob and Tom and at exactly 8:23 I notice a subtle blinking of white lights. I look up as everyone in my office is standing and gathering their things. "BLoop, BLoop" says the alarm. I can't help but wonder what is going on but the blooping is immediately followed by an explanation. Out of the flashy light comesa computerized,all-business kind of voice: "Attention, an alarm has been activated in the building. All personel are to follow their emergency response coordinators to the nearest exit. Stairwells should be used to exit the building. Elevators should not be used for evacuation purposes other than by handicapped personel...BLoop,BLoop". So what do you think happened? Fat and lazy people rushed to be the first ones on the elevator, the entire sixth floor crammed into the freight elevators, and people like me walked down the five flights of stairs at a pace where we surely would have died from smoke asfixiationifit had been a real fire.  After about 15 minutes were are cleared to go back inside. I climb to the fourth floor because the elevatorsare locked out and then I hear a strangely familiar "BLoop,BLoop". I walkbackoutside and pop a squat underneath a tree. They clear us to go in but I have learnedmy lesson. I continue sitting outside for another 20 minutes in case the alarm goes off again. It doesn't and those of us thatare left mosy on in. I take another 15 minutes getting to my office making a stopon every floor. When I arrive,my co-workers and I are given a fifteen minute speech on the consequences of not followingemergency procedures and are reminded thatwe are still on the clock when there is afire, it shouldn't take anyone more than 15 minutes to return once the building has been cleared...oh damn, was that one directed at me? I return to my work and take my usualmorning break9 minutes later.   The worst part of the whole shabang was that there wasn't even a fire, just a short inthe system.
