Who would know my sad heart.. Why do I feel so teary all of a sudden? Who would know my sad heart..  Its one in the morning, the intoxicated rain is falling Its a sleepless night.. Sometimes exhausted, bruised and painful heart I try to remember everything But all of them are just past memories They're just traces of my faded laughter The only thing that comes out are my deep sighs I believed everything was forever. I was stupid back then One by one, they are al leaving me I didnt hold onto everything yet, I wanted to forget you but For the remaining time, I miss you  Chorus) I want to cry, I want to cry, this heart Love goes.. Friends go.. everything goes...  You left me after you gave me a whole bunch of scars You left me after you made me a dumb idiot After I heard that my ex girlfriend was getting married, I pretended to to calm but when I was alone, I was hurt Girls these days dont want guys They just want a lot of money and fast cars So guys have to make a lot of money to love As I get older, little by little, I get farther away from my friends And once in a while I'd come across them, but it'd just be akward I dont know if its you who has changed Or if its me who has changed over time  repeat Chorus  You'll know when they all leave You'd probably know... You'll know when they all leave You'd probably know...  Yo, this is my life story as it goes on day by day I wonder if the skies are sometimes sad like me I wonder how you are right now, listening to this song I tell myself that I gotta smile, but I still shed akward tears But I still have to smile My throat gets tight and my heart is in pain, I want to cry  repeat Chorus
