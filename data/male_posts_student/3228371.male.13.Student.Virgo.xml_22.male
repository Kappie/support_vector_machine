Meh, better late than never. I'm glad I didn't decide to ditch worship again. Didn't write too many notes in there and I actually listened. I hope Martin did. The message could've really helped him there. Step into the unknown, take a risk, God is with you. Learned a lot... not only about Christianity but also about life in general. Definitely worth getting up so early. CD Team was cool too. Sat with Ames on the bus ride there and we talked. Just a bit. She's cool and really smart. Talked to me about softball. I wanna go play softball at RHCBC next summer. It'd be cool. :) Learn a new sport. I'm not too good with sports but I'll give it a try. Sounds like fun. Too bad I'm not of age this summer. Meh, whatever. There's always next year unless I get hit by a car before then and I die or whatever. God forbid.   Learned about Mormons and Catholics today. Well, Mormons were last week's lesson which I missed but that's okay. I read the notes from the duotang during this lesson and it was really interesting. Same with Catholic. I think I'm a little interested in Mormons... but, I know better than to even  think  about joining them. Not good. Satan's trying to tempt me and I know it. Can't give in. Please pray for me that GOD will keep me safe from temptations.  Thought about a lot of stuff during the time that was between worship and CD Team. Walked in this morning, late, for worship and stood beside Sally while we were all singing songs of praise. Surprised to see Wilfred there. I guess he didn't have Kung Fu. Oh wait, never mind. I think he was too tired to go to Kung Fu this morning 'cos he had like... 1 tournament and tons of demos these past few days. Hope he gets some good rest. Knowing him, he'll live through it without rest anyway 'cos that's just the type of guy he is. Meh, whatever. Talked to Ingrid a tiny bit about stuff before Karen and Erica and other people came outside so I shut up about it and I'll talk to her later on MSN or whenever about it. She'll read it all in my "thing" anyway.   Talked to Wilfred after CD Team. Saw him sitting on the ledge of the other doorway so I walked over and we talked a little. For some reason, it was... different. From before, I mean. It used to be all awkward because of our past but this time, I felt more comfortable with him. He felt like... a brother to me. Which is good. I gain another sibling in Christ. I hope that maybe this kind of relationship between the both of us will be better. It'll probably be a lot better. 'Cos it's times like these that I can use someone to talk to... someone that doesn't know much about the stuff but knows enough to give the right kind of advice. We've... got things in common. We think a lot. I don't mean  think  in the sense that others may think. I mean  really  think. Auntie Amy said that sometimes I seem a little more mature in the sense that I think deep... my perspective on that is that I don't think deep... I just think too much. Whatever.   It was weird talking to him after so long... but good in a way. Good that we don't go avoiding each other. Some guys just don't understand that girls... we look for communication in relationships. Or at least most of us do. I found that girls like to talk and interact more... whereas guys just do what they want and that's it. I dunno... whatever. Don't know, it's only what I think.  Talking to Julie on MSN. "Jealousy. Mistrust. Deception. Love. Truth. and. Lies. Welcome to our world." Very true. She and I are just discussing our nicknames. Mine says "Nothing But Empty Words". So basically, we're talking about how we deceive and yet there are so many interpretations of deceiving whereas the truth just exists no more. Very deep.   Bad timing... always bad timing. I have to go cook for my sister and I since I'm hungry. Noodles again. Ew. I'm tired of it. Well, I'll talk to Julie about this later... I'll blog later... maybe. My sister's going out to a party so I'll have the computer to myself. Maybe I'll go outside for a while. Iunno... maybe. Or I'll go take a jog or run... or maybe just a walk. Whatever I feel like doing. I'm off. Peace.
