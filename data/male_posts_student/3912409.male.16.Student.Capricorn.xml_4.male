When I woke up I turned on MSN and started talking to Cookie and BJ. Eventually I had to go to tennis, so I left at around 1:00. I only played two games today, one against Erika and I was winning 5-0 and then she gave up. My second game was a lot closer, I was playing against John and he was winning for the first half of the game.... but then I won five games in a row and beat him.    When I got home I made some toast with peanut butter and apple sauce, which is really good :D. Eventually Cookie started talking to me and she told me that she went on a helicopter. I've been on one and they're pretty fun. Ummm.... Cookie also made her own  urlLink blog . O yeah, I have a picture of the Care Bears shirt that Cookie made         isn't it great
