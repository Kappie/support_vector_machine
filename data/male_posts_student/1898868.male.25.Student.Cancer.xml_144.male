Where would I be today if it wasn't for Nuclear Assault, Testament, Anthrax, Exodus, and Kreator?   I'll tell you where: Probably sitting in some boarded up building counting the minutes until my next fix.  (wait, that is probably what would have happened if I would have continued to listen to speed metal)  On a lighter note, I am at the hospital waiting for my first patient and just noticed that my socks (which I believed to be light brown when I put them on this morning) are actually pink.  These must be the ones that I put in the washer with my red shirt.
