Works for me.  I don't need to learn.  I can't wait for camp to start.  I also want to see Passion of the Christ, but i never am able to get out to the mavie theaters.  Oh well, I will end up seeing it at some point in the future.  Man, i am actually posting like everyday, this is crazy.  Never thought it would happen.  That is all for now.  Will probably post again after teaching wrestling.  See ya.
