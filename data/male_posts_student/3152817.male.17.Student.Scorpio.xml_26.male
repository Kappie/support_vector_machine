Now I can justly criticize that piece of liberal trash (the movie, not the white trash that wrote, directed, produced, and stared in it). That was seriously the most wasted two hours I’ve ever spent in a theater. I’m glad I went for the matinee price rather than usual 8 bucks.    A post long enough to debunk all the stupidity in that film would take days to write so I’ll just hit on the most ridiculous points that Moore tries to make. The “Stupid White Man” starts out by attacking the president for not taking immediate action when he first heard of the attacks on that Tuesday morning. For 7 minutes after hearing that the country had been victim to a terrorist attack, President Bush sat in an elementary school classroom in Florida reading with students. What exactly did Moore expect Bush to do? Jump up, run out of the school, pick up a gun, and start shooting Muslims? Nobody really knew what was going on in the first few hours after the attack. There wasn’t anything that Bush could have done even if he had been at the white house.    Another of the bizarre ideas Moore throws out is that the Bush family is in the pocket of the Saudi’s and the Bin Ladens. The simple fact is that the Bush’s used to be in the Oil Business. What is the largest oil producing country? Saudi Arabia. Now how could it be that the Bush’s knew the Saudi Royal family and the second richest family in the kingdom, the Bin Ladens? Is it not plain to see that there would be some sort of business connection between big shots in the oil industry? And really, so what if the Bush’s do know the Bin Ladens? Just because Usama Bin Laden is a terrorist from Saudi Arabia, doesn’t make his family or any other Saudi automatically guilty of terrorism. Timothy McVeah was an American terrorist from Flint, Michigan (ironically the same town where Michael Moore is from). Does this make the McVeah family guilty of bombing the Oklahoma City federal building? Of course not.    Moore goes on to demonize US soldiers, making it point to show the carnage after US bombing raids in Baghdad. War is a terrible thing. I don’t think any sane human being disagrees with that. Unfortunately, war is sometimes necessary. It’s either war against terrorists on their turf, or endless suicide attacks on our homeland.    I strongly discourage anyone from going to see this “documentary.” It’s really nothing but 2 hours of propaganda. If you could shorten it to 30 seconds it would make a great ad for the Kerry Campaign.
