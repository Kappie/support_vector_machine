I'd like to thank Shanna, Tasha, Demeka, Heather, Mom and the sisters(first ones to call), Dad, Radiance (for being a great cousin), Lou, Crystal, Johnny, Phonso, Natasha, Tonya, Angela, Geoff, Jeralyn, Luther, Candace, Romney, Daana, OJ, Kelly, Beth, Dani, Toya J, Johanna, Nile, Reggie, Maurice, Nacosta, Tiff, Tiff, Tiff (I know too many Tiffany's), Alex, Lenia, Shawanna, and everyone else (I'm a bad memory guy....sorry) who careed enough to wish me a happy birthday or did something to make my day special....you made me a happy guy on a day I was trying not to be happy on....  I bought myself a copy of Fight Club (my other copy is considered a loss at this point), P. Diddy's newest absurd claim, The Eminem Show, and the book Red Dragon....  the P. Diddy CD is a good party CD....Fight Club on DVD is essential....Red Dragon is one of the best books ever, soon to be one of the better movies out (better than Manhunter for sure!)....  okay but lets talk about the Eminem Show....White America is pretty solid....not great....but I won't just up and skip it either....Business is about the same....Cleaning Out My Closet is where it starts to get Eminem-like....the gloves come off with his mom.....I don't know what to say except I'm happy that I love my family....Square Dance is kinda like something from the second album in as much as flow and content....solid track....a pretty funny skit revolving around the Kim incident with the bouncer is next....I like albums with worthwhile skits....Em usually has a few....Soldier, Say Goodbye Hollywood, and Drips are kinda lacking at least so far.....you've heard Without Me if you have a radio or television....not much I can say about that that would sway you in one direction or another....  Another Skit with Paul Rosenberg (he was the guy yelling on the Marshall Mathers LP) telling Em ot leave his gun at home....good if you like skits (I do)....Sing For the Moment is blahhhhhh....but then comes the stretch run.....and this is what makes the album worthwhile....Superman is the best song on the album to me....they'll probably play it out on the radio this summer with a few minor (language) changes....enjoy it before then the last verse is where it gets really good...Hailie's Song has some bad singing and as is the case usually with bad singing you either love it or hate it....my boy thinks that the one rapped verse on this cut is the best on the album.....that's arguable....it's a good verse....great song....what would an Eminem album be without Steve Berman?....well maybe the next one won't have him as a result of the end of this skit....another good skit....When the Music Stops is another pretty good one especially if you like D12 (then again I don't think most people not named Killa Cal liked D12)....Bizarre does his thing at the end if you are a clever enough listener....Say What You Say (the JD diss song) has some bad rapping by gay ass Dre which will probably arouse more speculation about his sexuality than quell it (don't think I don't read your lil interviews???....keep me AND TIMBERLAND's names out your mouth??....don't cosign for another producer dude!)....but oh well....Em holds up his end of the bargain, it's an aight song....Till I Collapse is another of my favorites....he brings it pretty raw and real on this track....and I like his list of his top rappers....the last real song on the album is My Dad's Gone Crazy featuring his daughter Hailie Jade....it's a decent song....nice touch of adding Hailie....  All in all it's not the Marshall Mathers LP....like my boy was telling me after he bought it, there is no stand out like Stan....Superman comes close but it's not an instant classic....it's a good buy....it's neck and neck with Ceelo for best album of the year so far....  Time to hit the sack...I found out I'm teaching Math this summer....this should be interesting....
