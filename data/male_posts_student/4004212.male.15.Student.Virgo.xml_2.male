Anyway, Cyp gave me 100mb of "Phwoar" and I plan to use it for many a thing! From Freelancer to NationStates to deviantART. Today I sent every thing for my new website from my Angelfire webspace to the Anima stuff, so far it's working well, and with the help of Korijn, I think it will be good! I just signed up for a Tag Board, I may get a dotTK in a minute and my 50 Schizophrenic Personalities (The Senate) are deciding whether (or not) to create a forum.    In other news, I decided not to go in town with Laura, shes gettin her tongue pierced and wouldn't be able to speak, and I probably don't know any of the other girls so it would be a waste. Also, some random person just added me to his MSN   urlLink  jimmygoodein@hotmail.com  . I think that will do for now.   ¯°¤~-_Ќαħчǻhл_-~¤°¯
