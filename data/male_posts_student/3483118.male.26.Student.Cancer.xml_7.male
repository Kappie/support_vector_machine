I don't know exactly what I want to write about when I become a big grownup of a journalist, but I'm glad I found his column on ESPN.com's page 2 because he showed me that my beat doesn't have to be a pigeonhole, no matter what it is.  It's worth your time to read some of these  urlLink tributes to him from colleagues and friends.
