At the moment, I have a few seconds of independent thought to spare, so I shall try to bring this charade of a blog up to date.  Exams have been happening of late. Quite evil, assuredly. Both English and Biology are null and void, as the exams for these have been taken care of in the Advanced Placement nonsense. We have been watching movies in Biology for a while now. Holla. Government exam is looming for tomorrow. That fuck is going to be deadly.  There really isn't that much to tell. Damn. I need more excitement...  I am currently grasping for jobs that don't grasp for me. This is upsetting. Davis-Kidd told me they would call this week, and they haven't. Damnit. I need money. Today my last check bounced. And then the bank charged three times the fucking amount of over-charging. Blah, System. So I need money.  I shall be going out with Heather Saturday night, to celebrate school's end as well as Heather's birthday. And I shall have cd's for her, filled with nonsensical tunes of power and oddity. We shall see Shrek.  Must be going. Grandparents have just arrived. Cheers.
