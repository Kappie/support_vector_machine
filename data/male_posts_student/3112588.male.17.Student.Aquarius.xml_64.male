Mostly its just the people that i love who keep me going. they tell me that i can do it, and not to give up no matter how hard it is...     2. What is most special about you  why?     I would have to say that the most special thing about me is the heart that i have for people. although im sure some of you are sitting there laughing, God gave me a heart to love people no matter what they do, who they are, what they've done...even though im not always nice about it, God really blessed me with a heart for people.     3. What good things make you cry?     Well, when someone is there for me and they tell me that they love me instead of just expecting me to know it. when i am told that i am loved at the perfect moment, it makes me cry. something else that really gets me is when people that i know can read me, and they give me the comfort that i need. they dont even have to ask, they just know me...and they take care of me.     4. What bad things make you cry?     The thing that hurts me the most is when someone that i love does something to hurt me. whether it is rejecting me, or leaving me behind, its like im dying slowly...     5. Do you think it's a bad thing to be emotional?     I'm not sure why i put this question in here, but i might as well answer it: no, i don't think it's a bad thing to be emotional, but i do think it's a bad thing to overreact and blow things out of proportion...this is definitely something i have been working on and am getting better at.     6. Which is better: friendless and happy, or popular and lonely?     You know, this is definitely a toughie. in both cases, i don't think i would be happy, but i would much rather choose friendless and happy, just b/c i know what it's like to be popular and lonely...and even though it seems like you're alright, you're just lying to yourself. at least God will be with me, and that would hopefully be enough for me.     7. Why do you feel you think the way you do?     I honestly know for a fact that God made me the person that i am, and He gave me the knowledge that i have. now, as for the thinking part--that is all me. i have taken pieces of my past and formed the almost total pessimistic mindset that i had for a long time...     8. What was the most terrible event in your life?     Ehhh i can't really post that here, but i think that i've told some of you that are reading this right now--i think that i've told about 3 of you...think hard, and you'll remember. for everyone else out there who doesn't know, let me just say that you're better off not knowing. but God lets everything happen for a reason, and different people to cross your lives for a specific purpose.     9. What was the happiest event in your life?     There have been a lot of really happy times in my life that i can recall, but the most recent event was when God sent me a friend that i needed so badly. there was no way i was going to make it through another year without someone that i could count on, and that i knew was going to care about me no matter my stupidity and big mouth.     10. List one situation when you felt your life was complete?     My life will never be complete, and i believe this is true in everyone's life. your life is never complete, but at times i felt it was complete when everything was going ok, God and i were on good terms...and drama was a word no longer in my dictionary.     11. List one situation when you felt your life was a disaster?     Recently when i made a large mistake and i ran every which way to try and do damage control...i thought that God had once again tried to show me that i cant take matters into my own hands. i have to count on Him.     12. If you have a love life, what is your favorite part about it?     When i had a love life, it was kind of generic...there wasn't really anything that special about it, since we decided to NOT let people know we were going out.but the part i cherish most about a "love life" is that there is someone that you love right next to you, and it feels as almost they will never leave you...and just the feeling that you want this person to be with you until the end of time at that exact moment...     13. In your definition, what is a friendship?     Wow, havent we exhausted this one out? haha...a friendship cannot be defined bya person, and it shouldn't even be in the dictionary in my own opinion. but, if you want a definition, here goes: a friendship is an inseparable bond between 2 people who truly love eachother...their love will stand the trials that they are put through, and grows stronger each time something terrible arises. the 2 people that have this great love for one another will always be there for eachother, and are willing to sacrifice whatever it takes to show their love for one another.     14. In your definition, what is a relationship?     Definitely has to do with a love between 2 people...kind of like a friendship, but with "benefits" if you know what i mean. i've always thought of marriage as just 2 good friends who have chose to live with one another for the rest of their lives--with sex involved, of course.     15. If you're a Christian, why do you think God lets bad things happen to you?     Sometimes it takes time for me to realize that God has actually let something so terrible occurr in my life...there are still situations that i have no idea what possible significance could come of them, but God will reveal them in time. He throws these things my way to see how i'll choose to deal with it, and to help me grow stronger.     16. What is your dream in life?     Tim already knows, since i've told him, i want to have about 4 houses all over the world, my own private jet, and a wonderful marriage. i don't want any kids, but hey--i am going to need a boy to take over the Cowart fortune once i'm gone, am i right?     17. What drives you to be successful?     Perfection drives me to be successful. not only that, but also having this terrible mindset that if i don't get the best possible place/thing out of whatever i'm striving for, i'm not worth anything. if i make situations into competitions, it drives me to do my best and stop at nothing to get what i want...     18. How far would you go to make someone you love, happy?     I would go to the ends of the earth--within reason--to make someone i love happy. i would, and have, made sacrifices to show my loved ones how special they are to me...so, to answer the question,i would go as far as i need to!     19. What types of things would you do to make them happy?     As i listed in question #18, i would make sacrifices and give things up which i really wanted in order to make a point, and show love.     20. If your friend asks you to do something that seems ridiculous, would you do it b/c you love them?     Unless they're asking me to murder someone for them, i would be willing to do it. i'm not a sucker or anything, but when it comes to people i care about, i'm willing to do some pretty crazy stuff---just ask my cousin...we did some crazy stuff. even though it wasn't to show eachother that we loved one another, it shows you that i will go far to make someone i care about happy.     21. How do you feel when your friend says: "you don't really know me" ?     Yes, i've had at least 5 people tell me that in my lifetime that i thought i really know. the funny thing is, i really did know them, but not as well as i thought i did. they're usually using it as a defense mechanism to protect their ownselves...but in actuality, they don't mean it--and if they do, they hopefully don't mean it in the cruel way or say it out of malice...  i felt like crap when they said it, but i got over it and moved on.    22. If you've been betrayed/backstabbed, have you forgiven the person yet?     God has given me the strength to forgive them, and actually put love in my heart for them. those people that have hurt me, i love now, and i wish that they were here so that i could show them God's love for them too.     23. Do you still face rejection? Where?     No, not really anymore...i'm more outgoing now, and trying not to let what people think of me, effect me so much.     24. What is your "safe" area when you're hurting/mourning?     My "safe area" would have to be...umm.......somewhere with someone that i love. if someone that is willing to comfort me is there with me, it doesn't matter where i am--that's where i will be safe.    25. What/Whom comforts you when you feel like you can't go on anymore?     Shopping is the material way of dealing with pain...Loved ones are sometimes that one's that can help me when i'm ready to just give up and throw in the towel..but sometimes it's just a little alone time and giving myself some time to think about the positive things in my life.     26. Last but not least...Why are you the way you are?     God and my past...nothing more, nothing less!
