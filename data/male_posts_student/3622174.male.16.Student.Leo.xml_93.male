I didn't think it could get that hot outside without large reports of death.  I live out in the woods, and if it were to all catch on fire right now...I would not be surprised.  But, about half way through the way home, I stopped and talked to this one kid, Wayne, that lives up the street.  He was riding on his golf cart thingy, and I had stopped right in the middle of the shade...so I got to cool down a bit before heading back in.      Two more days until I leave for camp (not counting today, obviously).  Hard to believe, right?  The amount of typed posts is about to go way down.  Waaay down.  Especially since there is only a one day overlay between YB Camp and the trip to the New York State.  My days of being on the interweb are gonna be shortened.   Tomorrow I'm going to begin the antagonizing process of packing for both trips.  I've got a lot of stuff to get ready.  For anyone who is coming along with me, I'm going to bring my Xbox, but, I've only got one controller and a couple games worth bringing.  Those games are MechAssault, SoulCalibur II, and Rallisport Challenge.  By the way, since I blog so much, a list of extra stuff I have to bring:    -Keyboard  -Mouse  -Mousepad  -Digi Camera  -Extra Batteries  -Xbox (w/controller, MechAssault, SCII, RC)  -Surge Protector    Yeah, that list has gone up quite a bit since the last time I posted it, so good thing its here.  Now I won't forget.  Well, that's about it for now.  I'll be back with your Late Night Bloggin' update for the night, plus something else!
