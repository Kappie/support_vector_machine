Everything seems to be telling me to let go. I don't want to let go. I want to believe. I want to have a true love story to tell my children and grandchildren. That felt weird. I miss her more and more as the days pass. Absence makes the heart grow fonder.  Met Dawn on the way home. Discovered that she actually lives pretty close by. She thanked me for talking to her after a shitty day. She was talking to her ex. I told her not to coz it wasn't a good thing to do to get over him.  SCREAMING IRONY IRONY IRONY . She says they're back together and he acknowledges it, but he still treats her like an ex. WHAT A JACKASS! DOESN'T THE BUM KNOW HOW FREAKING LUCKY HE IS!? ARGH!  Dawn is like me. We're going through the "I can't get over my other half" stage. Damned syndrome.  I did my D.I.S.C. personality test for the second time, today. I'm still a D.I. but my I has realllllly dropped like mad! Aiyah! screw personality tests lah, I'll be the best damn judge of who I am. I say I'm a capable leader who's almost equally sociable. Stick modesty up your own butt. I hope the lack of I in my graph does not affect my chances at the presidency. This might. Nvm, I'm supposed to be a risk taker.  Good night.
