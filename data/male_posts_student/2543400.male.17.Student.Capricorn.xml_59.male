It has to be something good a new energy it's making me more useful.  I saw the Bourne Supremacy and Bourne Identity on video. Good movies now I have to read the books. These are the books I want to read in the following order: Bourne Identity Bourne Supremacy Bourne Ultimatum Crying of Lot 49 (Because of the reference Justin Frankel used for WASTE)  There are many things I need to do starting this month. 1. Start my weight gain plan. 2. Start working out 3. Start work on summer hw 4. Start work on SAT 5. Start work on crypto program 6. Start work on some research papers 7. Start work on learning effective communication (i.e. Talking clear) 8. Start learning French again from the beginning, need to be fluent 9. Start work on learning German 10. Start learning Calculus and other high end math. (Why? Well because) 11. Start working on reading a lot 12. Stop going on computer for more then 3 hours (even that is too much) 13. Start meditation again 14. Start learning about business, investing and etc. (Why? Need to make $$$) 15. Start being more effective at what I do 16. Start being more focused and concentrated 17. Start learning matial arts (Akido, Kung Fu, etc.) 18. Start learning cryptography 19. Start writing a lot 20. Start learning guitar and bass once I get it  This is all in no particular order.  In the future I would like to learn these languages fluently. Some may be ones I know somewhat:  French (fluency) German Spanish Russian Telugu Hindi Japanese Chinese (Mandarin)  Why do I want to do this stuff? Because if 96% of my mind is unused then I think that is a lot of unused potential needing to be exploited. Therefore I want to learn the damn things. And plus it'll help me if I ever travel to Europe which I hope to do.
