Well, I think id do, but there are so many times when you think people are your friends until they never call/talk to you online all summer... It is a major bummer cause you love spending time with them, but it just isn't "real." Tonight, sitting here at my computer, I feel so alone. I always get these nights where I am home, alone, and wishing I had someone to talk to, or to just hold. This post seems like it has been discussed in previous posts, but it is just a reocurring problem! At the end of this week, I will be heading to one of the loneliest places on earth, Ogunquit Maine. It is always hard for me when I am up there because that is when you really know you are alone... No one calls you, no one is there to hang out with, there are only tourists who are not interested in me... It sucks, and I hate going up there, but I feel it is better to be alone there than here. I mean, if I am going to be alone, I want to be completely alone. I spend so many nights on the beach, sitting there listening to songs that make me feel even lonelier, but it just really shows me what life is/can be like. Those nights I don't come home until the wee hours of the morning because I have to regain my composure. I feel as if I am lying to myself, to the world, when I say that everything is all right. I mean, it is, but it isn't... So much stuff. I am not sure... Once again, I feel as if I should stop before I say something that could be taken in the wrong way, or something I wish I could take back.
