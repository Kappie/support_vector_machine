Last night he said things to me that I've always dreamed off... I got a little bit scared 'cause I really thought of this as a long and soon to be lasting relationship, I knew this was going to be the one that stuck, the one I'll be having for the next years, but it was always a thought. Yesterday, he confirmed everything. He told me what he expected of this, what he wanted. I was speechless... I couldn't say a thing... I was overwhelmed, scared, excited, full of love for this guy. I just hope ( and I'll work for this to last ).  What I love about him, I just can't put it in words, but let me tell you something, in his eager and funny kind of way, he doesn't pressure me, he cares for me! He has my best interest at hand. I mean, how can you not fall for a guy that makes you his priority? Or at least makes you feel that way. And he does makes me feel that way. He does.  We had a nice chat. Not a chit-chat, a real conversation ( well, most from his part, I was speechless ) of what we expected, what we feel about this, what we wanted to do. It's been a week, today is a week since we got ourselves in this relationship... so far so good... but how can not be that way with him? It just feels right.   Love you Adrian  ( my Bill )
