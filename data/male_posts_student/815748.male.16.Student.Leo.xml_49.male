She said that chickens used to be considered birds and therefore in a different category than regular meat (so you could eat them with dairy). However, she said, the current philosophy is that you shouldn't do something that looks like breaking a commandment even if it's technically legal (under Jewish law). It's like shredding documents... even if you aren't obstructing justice, it's still pretty shady, and if you start committing simulated crimes, then you won't care as much about not committing actual crimes. Ask my aunt about it if you still aren't convinced.
