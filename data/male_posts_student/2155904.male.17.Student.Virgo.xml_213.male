Henceforth, Tyke got up at noon today and played MVP for most of the day.  Like a very big portion of the day in fact.  He also watched some TV and listened to music but up until dinner he didn't even go out of the house.  At dinner though he went with his parents to La Casita for some Mexican food.  It was decent but not all that great.  But before Tyke left for dinner he remembered about the state baseball games.  He saw the score and detail for the first game where Swat threw a complete game 2-hitter and Issaquah won 6-0.  Then he tried to find the radio station that the Everett games would have been broadcast on but it turned out that the championship wasn't on there.  So Tyke had to wait until the scores were updated online.  Macaroon came over tonight.  Just the two of them.  They played MVP solely.  They did the Batter and Pitcher Showdowns which are pretty fun for a while.  But then they get kinda boring.  So they ended up stopping at 11ish.  Tyke had checked the score online and found out that Issaquah won 8-2 and are now 3A State Champions for baseball.  That's just tight.  Kinker called Tyke at 10ish but Tyke had already found out by that point.  Too bad Tyke wasn't still playing baseball but that's ok.  It was his decision anyway, although back problems did play into that.  But now it's just nice to be at the school that is champs.  And hopefully WSU can pull some of that same magic next year.  Or maybe UW can do well this year too.  Selection show is at 9AM tomorrow for the College World Series.  The CWS is fun to watch.  College baseball is fun to watch.  Especially if you know people playing.  Kinda like how John Olerud is cooler cuz of Tyke's connection, and Randy Johnson, and Curtis Borchardt.  All of these people either Tyke knows or a close friend of Tyke's knows.  Jim Beattie can be thrown in as wel but most of you probably don't have any idea who that is anyway.  Except for Kinker but Tyke knows Jim mostly through Kinker anyway.  Whatever, it's all relative.  Yeah, that meant nothing.  And now Tyke sleeps.  Sleep.
