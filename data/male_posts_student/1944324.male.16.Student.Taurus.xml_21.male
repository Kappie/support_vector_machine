Secondly, well, I'll get to that when I can reply to you.  I didn't want you to think I was being petty. Sorry, everyone else.  It's always a little stressful to get a months worth of E-mails all at once, and Lisa's were only slightly less annoying than Amazon.com's: Problem with your billing information.  Your order will be canceled in... 10...9...8...7...6.  Lucky I got to it now.  It still delays my order by 6 frickin' days. Other general complaints: My title scheme is to frickin' hard, Levi hogs the computer too much, and the flickering light above my head is really starting to get annoying.  Oh, and Ms. Knapp can take her 68% and stuff it. (I don't know what she can stuff, it just seemed like the right thing to say.) Errrr..... SQUEE!
