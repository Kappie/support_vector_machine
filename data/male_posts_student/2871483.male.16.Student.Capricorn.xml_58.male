They got their surfboards and they're goin' to the discoteque au go go. But she just couldn't stay, She had to break away, New York City really has it all. Oh yaaah oh yah!  Sheena is a punk rocker, Sheena is a punk rocker, Sheena is a punk rocker now.  -  I'm very pissed off at a few people who seem to think I skipped the past two days.  I've been ill, for chrissakes.  I've got a horrible sore throat, I can't talk, and a evil fucking headache.  So, to the next person who say's I've been skipping, prepare to have your stomache gouged out with a large garden pitchfork.  I'll be back to school probably tomorrow.  -  I'm not getting to sleep tonight, because I foolishly fell asleep at two o'clock and woke up at eight.  Silly me.  -  Well, I'm going to go lay down and watch American Idol.  Go Diana!!
