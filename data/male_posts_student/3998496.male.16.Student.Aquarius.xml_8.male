Im going down the street when my breaks fail and I colide into a poor lady infront of me. So I pull over to Omar street. I get out to find that my hood and side pannel are buckled and my front headlight is gone. The first thing I do is apologize to the lady. She was so nice about the whole thing. If i were in her shoes I would have lost my cool. (Thank you for being so nice if your reading this) So I see that her car has minimal damage done to it. So we ask for each others insurance information and all that jazz. So I call my mom who i thought was gonna kill me. turns out she was understanding. No police report was filed, no one was hurt. So it turns out the car will take about a week later and $1500 to fix. And by the way this is all because Dave like to pull my parking break when while im driving. So no car for me i am going to bed now bye
