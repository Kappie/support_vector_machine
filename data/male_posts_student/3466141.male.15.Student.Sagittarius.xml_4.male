As the smoke is never ending, in the darkness of our minds, The light here is forever fleeting, and we can never see the skies.   If anybody ever cared, I don't title these things when I write them, I give them titles when I post. Slowly, but surly, I'm going to run out of these crappy little writings to post, and then I'll have to talk. Gladly, I don't have a life, so I can't really talk about that, but I'm sure something interesting will present itself for me to talk about.
