For years, I’ve longed to be a revolutionary leader. I’ve dreamed of giving voice to the aspirations of those trapped in the dungeons of despair and indignity. I’ve dreamed of standing upon the convictions of justice as I facedown the evils of our global masters. I’ve dreamed of forming the indignations of the masses into the hammer of protest. I’ve dreamed of envisioning a world to come, a world where members of the human family no longer seek to kill, control, and exploit each other with guns or bombs, prisons or police, industries and markets. I’ve dreamed all of these things, but have never known how to realize them.  I’ve yearned to be at the podium before the chanting crowd, but there has been no crowd. I’ve yearned to lead the march to capital steps, but there have been no marchers. I’ve yearned to rally hunger strikes while jailed for a noble cause, but there have been no noble causes to bring forth my heroism.  I was depressed, disappointed, despairing over having my longings frustrated. If only the world knew of the courage possessed in side of me! I knew there must be a pathway to my blooming, my blossoming. I knew there must be a first step that I could take that would place me on my way to the revolution.  I thought over the matter. I considered how a revolutionary must possess the right critical consciousness. A revolutionary must understand the violence of racism, capitalism, authoritarianism, sexism…A revolutionary must understand the systems and institutions of oppression. Indeed, I did possess this mind. I then considered how a revolutionary must have a vision for the future. A vision for a life where society is organized to ensure equality, individual liberty, self-governance, just rewards…I did possess such a vision. Finally, I considered how a critical and visionary mind needs a platform. What good is a revolutionary if the revolution is stored in a locked closet, shelved amidst broken dreams?  I considered the matter at length. Alternative newspapers were a limited platform. I could write but leaders must do more than write. They must be actors in the public sphere. They must be speakers in town square. I needed a place from which to speak. I racked my brain for where I might speak, how I might take my first steps into that unwieldy world of exposure before the common peoples of this land.  And then finally, I discovered an organization that sought to empower men and women from different walks of life to become public speakers. The name of that fine organization is toastmasters. It is toastmasters that changed my life for the better. It is toastmasters that has placed me on the road to the vanguard.
