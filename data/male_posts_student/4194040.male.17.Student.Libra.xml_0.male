In the evening the ROTC guys walked around, talked, answered a couple questions, and then we went to a Pub and sat around, meeting people.  Saturday - Climbing Wall, Spider Web, One Man Rope Bridge. Free meals all day. Did some "drill and ceremony" for a couple minutes, the parade rest is messed up. yeesh. I am the master of the climbing wall. Could have watched Stripes but went out and met people instead. Had to fill out about a dozen pages of paperwork. Did a lot of talking among each other and the other MS cadets. So all is good.  Today..some sort of games and barbecue.
