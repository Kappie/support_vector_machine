This is equally bad, because I can't be mad at an emotion.  I need to be mad at something less abstract.  It usually ends up that I try to take my mind off things by thinking of something else.  I started looking at BlackPlanet.com, wow, that was a mistake.  I'm starting to hate everything to do with hip-hop culture.  I mean, it's bad enough that Uncle Sam and The Man decided to give us AIDS, and allow us to be poor (I'm a strong believer in "umoja" your problems are my problems), but then we have to get a huge corporate system that feeds off pure ignorance and rewards people for it.  Damn.  I'm pretty pissed off, and some good people fromthe surrounding towns get caught up in that bs as well.   Wow.  Then church.  Granted, I'm not an agnostic, I believe in the One and I believe in The Truth, but besides that it's iffy.  I hate Church, black and white churches I have different reasons for hating.  Black churches, somehow, try to act like the voice of black liberation will teaching opression, and completely ignoring extremely important things that are native in most African cultures (ancestor worship, which I've even known non-religious people to do), hell even the Carribeans didn't completely let it die out.  I guess it's the whole "Well, I'm a minster, my job is in the church" type of thing that annoys me firstly.  Yes, you have a degree in administrating a church, and doing all sorts of social activities, oh and you have a degree in reading the bible (I am over simplifying matters, because I don't know enough about the subject), but why do you suddenly act like you have the voice of a god reverands?  I don't care if god gave you a vision about giving money to the church, I didn't get that vision, so it wasn't all that important.   Then, I have to go to church until I'm 18 and move out according to my mother.  That wouldn't seem that extreme, except I expressed a desire to go to another church, and pointed out that I'm confirmed.  I am free to do what I want in matters of my spiritual growth, it's no longer her responsibility.  That really burns me up, add to the stress, and all I can hang onto for stability is anger.
