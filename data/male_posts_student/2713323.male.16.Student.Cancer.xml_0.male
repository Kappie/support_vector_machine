Neeways...what to get her?! I really don't know lol. Maybe i'll go buy tommorrow. Well i had to take off my socks this morning because they were angle length, then after school the prefect wanted to return it to me, and i took a look at the bag and said, forget it. I can't believe Mrs Ng made us stoop so low, taking our socks from a bag filled with them. Well i'll have to get new socks now. All because of that...yeah. Maths in school was really loooong today, the four straight periods seemed like 5 hours. Hahah i scored 24 for a maths, very shocked. Lady Luck is on my side. Mrs pereira said we cant drop A maths. O well, im just going to do nothing during that period, cos i've reached a point of No return, i cant catch up. CLB tommorrow. 8 am. sheesh. so early....................ciao.
