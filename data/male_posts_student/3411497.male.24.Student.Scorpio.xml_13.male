But please realize how easy it is to be The Black Blossom, how easy it is to never be removed from my unique and brilliant banter... I don't know what it's like to not have myself around, so I'm always happy and laughing -- so please forgive my thoughtlessness.  Now, the first and only order of business today is to publicly establish the parameters of "the perfect woman" -- I am doing this not only because I constantly have young women pounding on my door, calling my phone, and leaving notes for me at work and on my car, but also because I don't like any of these women.  To the layman, I might appear to be somewhat of a loner -- a sophisticated eye, however, will discover that I am simply very picky... I know what I want, and I don't settle for anything else.  All of that said, who am I looking for?  Essentially, I am looking for Sigourney Weaver's character of Ripley from "Aliens".  Let's make this supremely clear: I am not looking for Sigourney Weaver, I am not looking for Ripley from "Alien", "Alien 3", or "Alien: Resurrection"...  I am looking for Ripley from "Aliens".  Do not say I have a crush on Sigourney Weaver.  She's an attractive lady, but she's no Ripley.  What do I appreciate about Ripley in "Aliens"?  Well, let's start with the superficial.  She's a hot lady.  The Black Blossom appreciates beauty.  But hot ladies are a dime a dozen, especially here in Arizona.  You're going to have to be more than hot to snag The Black Blossom.  I can get hot by walking outside -- so if you think your spaghetti straps and thong underwear rising over your jeans is going to get me all riled up, think again.  A clone of you and your style will reappear within five minutes, and you will be forgotten instantly, replaced by another globule of American beach style.  Not impressed.  I'm glad you're hot, and make no mistake, I'll look at you, but don't think I'm going to talk to you, much less be nice to you or appreciate you at all unless you're smart and tough like Ripley.  Beauty is not a pass, so don't flash it at my door thinking you'll get in.  You'll get bounced faster than a Bob Cousy dribble pass.  That's right, you saw me write "tough and smart".  That's what I want.  I want a woman that can spot a corporate sleazeball.  I want a woman that doesn't take any shit from unethical assholes.  I want a woman that knows her books, knows her movies, and in general, just plain-ass knows her shit.  She also has to know that she knows her shit.  Most importantly, I want a woman that will, (if the need arises), duct-tape a flamethrower to a machine gun and invade hostile alien territory.  (She doesn't have to know HOW to use a machine-gun or a flamethrower, necessarily.  She just has to be willing to pick them up and use them if a small innocent girl is kidnapped by aliens.)  Manners are cool.  I'm not looking for some 100 mile-an-hour lady that's going to kick my ass if I disagree with her, knows more dirty jokes than me, exclusively drinks whiskey and scratches her crotch in public.  I'm not about that.  I subscribe to a few ideas of femininity, for better or for worse, and maintaining a certain level of that is required.  No monster truck enthusiasts.  No doily collectors either.  Really, the best way to find out what I'm attracted to is to watch "Aliens".  If you think you fit the bill, go ahead and drop me a line.  No fakers, I'll spot you -- I'm looking for a Ripley, not some farcical imitation.  I hope this has helped.  I'll be happy to answer questions.  I hope this has helped in some capacity.
