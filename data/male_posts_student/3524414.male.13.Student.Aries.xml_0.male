Kristopher DEFINATION-->Whole day wear shirt wif collar .. put necklace inside the collar .. style hair like a piece of shit .. think damn mature damn cute (LET ME TELL U THIS,STOP TRYING TO ACT CUTE WIF UR STUPIT EARS) .. put braces must tell the whole green Earth .. whole day fake got drumset like his druming damn pro .. actualy can't even be compared to my grandmother's .. think soccer skills damn good .. be a goalkeeper only know how to screw up the whole team .. goalkick mus act cool .. take the ball must whack bottom part try to act like he is thinking where to throw the ball to .. actualy inside his brain is empty .. when he stop acting cool and decides where to throw the ball .. he will either pass to the enemy or kick out of the field .. still wan fake know how to play guitar .. to cut it short,he is a flirt who does not even look at his own fucking reflection .. so,if any girl who is liking him now reads this,please think twice maybe ten times about faling in love with the kristopher fu.
