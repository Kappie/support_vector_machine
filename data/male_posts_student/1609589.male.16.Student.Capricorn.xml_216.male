I guess i'd better live up to the standards i've created for myself... here is a post I wrote for my friend on some forums we use at school(he had said he had gotten to "20 battle rank" or whatever in the game Planetside, and he's also a forumwhore, and I was feeling stoopid, so I just started typing :-O):  They should give forum whores like you with rank 20 sooperman powers. You e-mail sony now and say "I's a forumwhore bitch! its official!" and they're like ":-O sorry master lawls!" and you're like "X-D" and they're like "Now let's eat cake and be merry" and you're like "X-P yes mahm" and theyre like "im not a mamn you son of a cake horn!" and you're like "sony you assblock" and theyre like "go fuck a cheesegrater" and theyre like "hey, that's jesses cool line because he kicks ass" and they're all "well go eat a poison taco" and you're like "but tacos are teh shiz" and they're like "well ill beat you at a eating contest" and you're like ":-O" and they're like "thats right bizzle, we eats a lots" and you cap all of them because you're a leet rank 20 forumwhore. :-O
