The Mighty Mighty Bosstones - Where'd You Go?   Checked the clock when I got home and realized I was alone. Sat for hours by the window wonderin' where did ya go? Couldn't eat or sleep at all took the pictures off the wall. Paced the place as time moves slow and I'm wondering Where did ya go? Where'd ya go? Where'd ya go? I wanna know! Lit a cigarette I couldn't smoke Wound the clock until it broke. Went to bed then took a shower, stared at TV for an hour. Did the dishes, made the bed. Read a book I never read. Any minute you will show and I'm wondering where did ya go? Where'd ya go? Where'd ya go? I wanna k now! I opened the fridge, I opened a beer, played a tape I couldn't hear. Emptiness began to grow and I'm wondering where did ya go? Watched the sun come up from the back stairs. Thought about the last few years. I lost control I screamed, I cried I punched a hole and went inside. Packed my things, called a friend. Wished this emptiness would end. Wrote a note then tore it up, poured the beer into a cup. Sat on the couch, drank it slow, wondering where did ya go? Realized I couldn't stay, I grabbed my things and went away. Where'd you go? Where'd you go? I wanna know!
