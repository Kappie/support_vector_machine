The first was we jus basically worked on our serving and our passing, my passing was not that great today though, but it was alright. Then we worked on our hitting and after a few repz dan put a chair for us to hit and if u hit it then u get a shirt. I hit the chair and knocked it over, so i won a shirt...w00t!...then we had to hit from the outside, and mark hit the chair, but it didnt jus fall down, it like stayed tippin over for like forever, it was insane, but it fell down so he won a shirt. Then then we played 2 man the whole time, and i was paired up wit this one dude nick, who totally sux, and since i didnt want to run, we won both timez and it was kick ass. Ill post stuff lata...payce outside.
