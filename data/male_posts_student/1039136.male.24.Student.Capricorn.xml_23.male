I usually come back with a good party story, but thats not happening because I had a thought come into my head on my way out of my Computer Security class. I was thinking about lives and jobs, because I realized that most people who have comp sci as a major have computers as their lives.  I don't think i would EVER be able to have computers as my reason to live. Let's face it, i'm not a dork, i have a social life, i like people most of the time, and i'm not a shut in.  I would really like to get a job that I would enjoy as my life, though.  I guess one of the things that drives me the most is the need to be someone that matters to everyone.  Most job/life Ideas that have crossed my mind mostly deal with "pop culture" because I guarantee you that  more people in the US know who Carson Daly is than people who know who Bill Gates is.  Yes, Money is power, but Fame makes the US go 'round.  I want to be known..and i'm sure as hell not going to get known hacking away at a computer for the next 40 years of my life.  I need to fall into something...it HAS to happen..i cant stand being nobody..money makes the world go round, but without notoriety you may as well fly off of it, because no will give a shit if you do.  Anyone want to make me famous?? I'm very marketable!!!!  Make me famous damnit or i'm doomed to being miserable for a lifetime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :(
