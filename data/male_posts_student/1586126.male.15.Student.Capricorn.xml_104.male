As if i could say much about it hehe: I went to Quique and bought... What did I buy? I bought new shoes: they're the kind I always use, some white Reef shoes that look a little too tight. I still like them. I also bought a long-sleeve red Quicksilver (?) shirt and a yellow short sleeve one. Um, some weird cargo pants of some fabric and because of going to the store we got late to the baptism. How late? The church had closed and the mass had ended. Bleh. We went straight to my uncle's house and spent the day (3 hours) there. I went to the park with the little kids (they're all younger, so I can't really make comments, because they're too young [or stupid] to understand. I think I get along pretty well with the kids. They bore me too much, though. ¬¬ Yeah. When I  grow up I wanna have all of Aphex Twin's discs. And listen to them all day haha. I just took a bath and my mom got home. Time to get dressed.
