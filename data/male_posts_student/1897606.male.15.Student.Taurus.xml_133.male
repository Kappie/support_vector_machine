I get the feeling that kids feel like they have to be kids. Like they're not going to have a full life if they don't go to a movie every Friday night, or if they don't have a big reserve of humorous anecdotes to tell to their families on Thanksgiving when they're old and worthless. It's think people are trying way too hard to fit this fucking mold that is layed for us in American Pie, on fucking MTV. I don't know, it just seems a little trivial to me. I'm perfectly happy sitting at home by myself and watching a DVD's or playing video games.   Am I wasting my life? Do I care?
