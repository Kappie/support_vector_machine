I need food before more work is done, and beer can be had.  Yea so I've been sleeping a lot... so sue me. I'm feeling the weight of like 300 pages of reading, a paper, and a bibliography on my back... it's fun! (just kidding)  I've got some classic movies sitting on my desk.  Spellbound  and  Breakfast at Tiffany's .... should be good, but perhaps tomorrow night would be better.  ***
