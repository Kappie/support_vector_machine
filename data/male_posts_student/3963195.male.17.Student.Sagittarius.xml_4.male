We were famous in our place but now due to the death of my great grant father all were split. Now there is no Thoppil family but to retain the name of the old memory many of the inmates has named their house Thoppil. My great aunt used to say that you should be proud to be borne into a family like this. During the British reign in India, once a diwan (who has a power of a Minister) from the royal court of Travancore came to our family on his visit. This is the story of my family….Now lets come to my house. I live in the south of India in the famous GOD ON COUNTRY “Kerala”. I live with my father mother and a sister. I had my pre schooling in Infant Jesus Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School…one of the leading schools in my town. It is said to have been found by British people during their reign in India. I finished my 10th standard ICSE from Infant Jesus with 67.5% mark and I also finished my 12th ISC with 73.25% mark. Now I am waiting for my admission to the college I have taken commerce as the main subject at my high school so I wish to take an undergraduate degree in commerce
