Khaki pants and a button down green shirt with blue strips 4. Any people or animals around you? Describe them. Just my dad, do I need to go any farther? 5. What are your plans for the weekend? Hmm, my plans were to hang out with Quinn and go to the mall with Noe. Below is what really happened.   urlLink     MY WEEKEND:  Friday after baseball, I had my dad bring me home, then I went over to Quinn's. I have been spending a lot of time with him. It is great. Friday night we ate Taco Bell, the whole time arguing. I got so mad that I threw 8 cigs out the window. I know, what was I thinking. But yea, we got over that, and then we fell asleep while watching Airplane. That movie is sooooo stupid, lol. But yea, then Saturday morning, I took a shower, then checked email while Quinn took a shower, then we went to Fry's electronics. I thought I had died and gone to heaven. It is sooooo big. lol. Quinn said he messed in his pants, he was so happy. Then Quinn broght me home, and I hung out with Stefani till about 430. Then I came home, and that was that. I woke up Sunday, got ready to go to church (yea tell me about it) and I checked my email. Noe cancelled on going to the mall. :'( His parents said he couldn't go out on a Sunday. OH well, what can you do.   When I got home, Uncle David, who works at Microsoft, had sent us Christmas presents. I got Age of Mythology Collectors Edition. It has a figuring, a DVD on how they made the game, posters, game, music cd, and all sorts of other stuff. It hella kicks ass. But yea. Okay, that is how my life is now. I will post more later.
