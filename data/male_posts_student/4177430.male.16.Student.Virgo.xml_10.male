It went by very fast--we called over 100 people and asked them who they wanted to vote for this election.  If they said Kerry, we would ask them if they could help out the campaign in any way possible.  Out of 100 people I got 3 Kerry supporters, 4-5 Bush, and one Nader.  All the rest either didn't answer or hung up.  I was a little nervous at first, making cold-calls, but after a while, it got easy (especially since most didn't answer their phones).  David and I had some funny encounters mostly involving either really old people or really hardcore Republicans (David's are funnier though--I'll let him post the highlights).  One time, in weariness, my fingers fumbled and I accidentally called 911.  Good thing you have to dial 9 to get out, or else that call would have registered.  I did it a second time, but this time, I had already entered the area code too, and it started ringing!  I hope dispatch knows the only emergency we'll have is a case of over-flipping out when Kerry wins.  The time, surprisingly, went by very quickly.  I calculated that we pressed over 1,500 buttons.  Even though we got a lot more Repugnicans than Dems or Indies, when a lady working there saw that we were calling South Euclid, she rolled her eyes and said, "Oh  yeah ."  We wanted to call up our friend Kyle who is (in our humble opinion)   w  a  s  t  i  n  g     his vote on the Green Party, but we forgot his number.  Speaking of third parties and wasted votes: IF YOU ARE LIBERAL, THERE IS NO LOGICAL REASON IN THE ENTIRE WORLD THAT YOU SHOULD BE VOTING FOR ANYONE BUT JOHN KERRY.  People who want to vote Green seem to forget that Kerry has a 95% on environmental issues.  A 60% is considered great.  Considering that there are no real conservative third parties (unless you count Nader, who gets most of his support from Republicans who...guess what!...want him to take votes away from Kerry), it's a fractured base against one other party.  No one cares about your "principles" in this election, possibly the most important election of our lives.  Getting the 5% for next election won't matter when, by then, our country is  FUBAR .   What Green and third parties need to do is not go straight for the President, but build up a base in lower positions, congressional or local, so that when the time comes for them to run for president, they actually have a base of voters that has a chance of getting them elected, not just for this mythical Holy Grail of 5%.     What are they going to do with the Federal funding they get if THEY DON'T HAVE A LEGACY OTHER THAN 8 YEARS OF BUSH?  No matter what anyone tells you, third parties  do not work in an electorial college .  People cite third parties as being responsible for the demise of slavery, leaps and bounds for labor, and other special interests, but guess what!   THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ELECTED THEMSELVES   (other than Teddy Roosevelt, who ran on and Independent platform that was exactly the same as the Republican one).  The best they can hope for is one of the larger parties absorbing their platform.  And considering that John Kerry has a NINTY FIVE PERCENT on environmental issues, I would judge the Green Party effectively absorbed (with, ironically, only 5% left to them).  We need to a) not vote third party, even in non-swing states.  Contributing to the popular vote count is as important as tipping the vote in swing states; b) get as many people voting as possible.  The more people we get to vote, especially in the 18-24 age group, the inevitable result is more Kerry supporters.  If Bush wins this election, it's not because a majority of Americans want him to be president, but because a majority of Americans didn't make it to the polls.  You know who really stole the election in Florida?  It wasn't just Bush.  It was third parties.  Six hundred plus votes went to Socialist or Communist parties.  Hey, at heart, I may be with them, but WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?  The last person that liberal that was almost elected was Eugene V. Debs, and that was during a labor crisis so bad that becoming a Pinkteron was the best career move you could make (considering everyone but them was getting their shit kicked).  The Florida election was so close that if those liberals had voted for Gore, it would have likely tipped the election beyond Bush's stacked Supreme Court's fanagling.    A vote for a third party is a vote for Bush.  There is no way around it.
