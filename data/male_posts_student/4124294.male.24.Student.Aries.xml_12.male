The latest lesson is uploading photos, which might not seem like a big deal to those of you who are extremely experienced in the joy of doing that, but it  is  for technophobes such as myself! Heheh.  Anyway, today I woke up at 12pm, and I asked myself,  What's going on?  Ah, the plight of being a student living away from home. I'm sure many of you can empathise with the notion of going to bed at 4am and waking up with the sun high, high, high up in the sky - especially when all your classes are in the afternoon, leaving you only the evenings and the nights to do your homework and research and whatnot.  The problem with being here in Perth is, unlike Malaysia, shops shut by 5pm on most days - which means, of course, that by getting up at noon and going to classes, there leaves very little time for one to go out and do anything in the way of mingling with the outside world. By the time I walk out of class at 4:30pm, I realise I only have half an hour to go down to the local supermarket to buy, say, a roll of toilet paper. Believe you me, it can be a shitty situation. Of course, the way out would be to wake up earlier - but that would imply going to  bed  earlier as well. The problem with me is, I'm stuck in a routine. I can't sleep before 4am. I try, but I can't. Lie in bed and stare at the cobwebby ceiling, with all sorts of thoughts going through my head. I look at the clock, and it's 2AM. I stare some more. Toss. Turn. Look at the clock, and it's 3AM. Stare. Toss. Turn. And then, just as I am drifting off, I realise it's 4, and the cycle begins again. Oh, the humanity. Anyway, fellow late-nighters, keep me company by leaving comments or emailing me, or adding me on to MSN at nickmaniac@hotmail.com. It's all fun.  Hmm. Maybe I should've repeated the above paragraph to myself. Might've helped me doze off easier.  _________  And finally, in the spirit of egocentricity, may I attempt to put up an image, testing my newly-acquired photo-uploading skill! A photo of me and a flashy digital camera that  isn't  mine. Oh well.
