I had a convo last night that got me thinking which is never a very good thing for me while it's happening.  Hopefully I'll end up with the right answers and no questions remaining.  Ugh, I thought all the rough who I am and what I want struggles were over.  Now I find I have some over-the-summer "homework" so I can answer some more problems.  Well actually it's not too much of a problem, but I'm just kind of thinking about it so it consumes my time y'know.  At any rate I suppose I still have much to learn to be a knowlegable sensei.  That's how my weirdness started.  It continued on when I was woken up at 6:00 to get the stinkin trash out.  Gahrrrrr.  After that trash I went right to bed, but was then woken up seconds later asking what time I set my alarm for.  Apparently I needed to set my alarm for 9:30 to be into work at 11:00 instead of 10:00 like I had previously planned.  So I reset my alarm and went back to sleep.  My alarm "pleasantly" woke me up at 9:30.  I sat in bed for a few minutes trying to fathom what was going on when I recieved a call.  I didn't know who it was while I was still in bed, but when I heard the voice on the answering machine it sounded like Asim.  Because of that I rolled out of bed to check the answering machine.  Gahrrrr.  It was none other than Mr. Yeiter.  I called him back after he sent a letter out to the class but never made contact.  Anyways we talked after I called him back yet again and then I began getting ready for work.  I ironed a shirt, ate, brushed my teeth washed my face and forgot to shave.  GAAAAAHHHHRRRRRRR.  Fortunately for me nobody noticed.  I guessed my wiskers just weren't enough for anybody to see.  How humiliating, yet at the same time kinda good.  Well, my dad took me to work and I feel kinda weird riding with him because we really don't say all that much.  I guess we just don't really have anything in common besides blood and being of the same gender.  So after he dropped me off, I went to my mom to have her clock me in.  After I get clocked in I found out that everything in the place was off kilter.  The third register was baisically non-existent, I didn't know many people that were working today, the busiest part of the day wasn't busy at all, and weirdest of all I felt like I was going so slow, but my register time was the fastest I'd ever seen in my life... 31 seconds at the end of the day.  Gahr?  Anyways before I left for home, I had to mop the floor and found out we had another mop bucket (not the one in the closet.)  Also during the day I had some goofy customer I felt like I recongized.  He came in and asked for two cups of water and babbled something about water being essential on a day like today.  Idk it was kinda weird.  (You know I love you JDR, man :P)  Ok after that weird day at work I came home and played some video games and did some work on my computer.  Then we watched Ahmish in the City (still a great great show though I can't vouch for the language anymore and may have to duck out of the sexual content here in a couple weeks).  After that I studied a mess in my drivers manual.  I had been studying 1/2 hr. every night for two nights and now I'm studying some more for tomorrow because I'm going to take my test.  Now for me studying two nights in a row and then studying even more for a third night is crazy for a test.  I never do that on tests at school, but somehow my mom is still on me about studying even more for this test.  In any case, I'm still gonna study some more after I'm done with this post, but I can pretty much quote everything I'm going over as I'm going over it so I don't see much point in it.  Something else that happened today was Bre's computer is messing up with it's internet.  Luckly for somebody (prolly all parties involved and some that aren't), Mrs. Prosch knew what the problem was and I had the easy solution.  The only problem is I had to lend one of my disks without me being there.  I don't have the files on that disk backed up which really goes against what I know I should do.  I'm going to hope that this doesn't bite me in the butt.  Anyways, that's all the weird things that have happened today.  BTW, I'm still in a quandry.  I guess you could say it's girl trouble even though I don't have a girl to have trouble with.  The problem is I kinda like the girl, but I don't know if/how/when I should tell her anything about it.  I suppose if I took my own advice, it wouldn't matter if I do or not because this may or may not effect the rest of my life because God has the ultimate plan for my life and I'll get there through Him, but I value the girl to much to get her involved if she needn't be.  I hate being single, but I don't want to hurt someone because of what I want so I'm going to have to see how I really feel and if it's really practical so the girl won't get hurt in the process.  Anyways, holla lata to all the party peoples.  The man who's lost in thought, Joshua R. Guynn  ex-philosopher
