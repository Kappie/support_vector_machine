Girl:Ok, I Love u. Slow down!  Guy: Now give me a BIG hug.  *Girl hugs him*  Guy: Can u take my helmet off  put it on? Its buggin me.   In the paper the next day:  A motorcycle had crashed into a building because of break failure. 2 ppl were on it but only 1 survived.   The truth was that halfway down the road, the guy realized that his breaks broke, but he didn't want 2 let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she Loved him  felt her hug 1 last time, then had her wear his helmet so that she would live even though it meant that he would die.  -----  Normally, it would be 'short and sweet', but for this case, this story is short and bitter. Hahaz!!! Quite touching. Have seen this quite a number of time before in Friendster. Now I seen it again, so post it for fun lorhz. I haven't sleep lehz. Shit!   Must go sleep now. Got to wake up at 7 tomorrow.   Night. Night to you too.
