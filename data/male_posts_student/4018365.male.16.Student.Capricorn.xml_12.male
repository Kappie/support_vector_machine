Sister came out, and we did the room. well my brothers room, since mine is already quite done. well i hate my aunt. shes so annoying. i hate her. i wish she would just leave this house. Jef is being weird around his cousin. I've never seen him act this way before. I feel like a zombie. Ruining my life, just sitting here, and listening to music. I need a job. Badly. I think I'm going to start my quest on looking for a job pretty soon, maybe after summer school. thats if I don't drop out. Well I hate myself. I wish I looked like some people on myspace, there so pretty, and I'm yeah. Well goodbye.     -jay
