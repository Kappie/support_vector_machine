Living under the same roof with someone i don't even interact with anymore. it's getting to the point that i really don't care. There is so much going on for me right now that i don't care to stop and reflect of the life that i had a few short weeks ago, to the life I have today.  ******************************************************************      So many people count on me for things, friends that need a kind word, a prayer and a thought, or just someone to be there when they get home from doctors appointments and dates with strangers. a new door into my soul has been opened and i don't regret walking throught that door either. A wise man once said that " Regrets are the past weighing down your present!" so no regrets ....   *******************************************************************      what can i say about today, but my star is on the rise and the sun is rising in Montreal as I write this. I've seen alot of sunrises from my window. this has been an incredible time for me. and i've enjoyed every minute of it. I don't know what to do with the life I left behind and how I am to address it. I don't htink that I am going to either.  *******************************************************************    People, so many people in my life today, my cup runneth over. There is no time to stop now, one can only move forward with the momentum guiding me in that direction. I have worries that Jon is going to have to face a very hard task, and I worry that I cannot physically be there for you - but know I am there as close as i can be for you. You are such a strong young man with such promise. I fear that the light may go out on your soul so please " Hold ON" to the light and know you are not alone.   ********************************************************************    Family.......... what to do with them. I can't go backwards only forwards. No looking back now. I cannot get saddled down with their issues and problems, that's why i left Florida in the first place. They don't give a shit about me so why should I them. Ah the Burning question of the heart of a servant of God. Should my care and compassion have limits to those who have abused my good graces and spit on my name...why yes i think so.          ********************************************************************
