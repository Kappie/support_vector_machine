(anyone got a scanner I can use?) Hiked down about 1/3 of the canyon -easy hiked back up 1/3 of the canyon - tough tough tough luckily we got back just before a big storm hit with a amazing mix of snow (it is 7000 feet) hail and rain with some thunder and lightening   so I will be back tomorrow evening
