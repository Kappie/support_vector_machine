Let me cover my adventure at the  urlLink Powell Brothers Offense-Defense Lacrosse Camp . It was quite interesting playing on the same team as quite possibly the best lacrosse player of all time.   As part of the camp I was given a free  urlLink Harrow lacrosse shaft  that has become my personal weapon. Christened the Beating Stick.   I also recieved a shirt signed by the brothers as part of the camp. Picture coming soon. Unfortunately, no pictures from that trip.   There was a one day layover between that and my Mather trip.
