It really didn’t hurt to much that night. Well when I woke up the next morning holy cow I felt awful. I probably laid in bed for an hour because I could not move. Well I got up and called my mom to see what to do. She came at lunch and meet with my grandparents who agreed to call the Chiropractor. Well a couple hours later I went to the doctor. He was pretty surprised to see my condition. He said this was the worse neck non-auto accident injury he seen in a long time. Ha believe me it felt like it! Well first off he examined me and then we went back to take some x-rays. We took 3 x-rays. The last one didn’t turn out, but he still showed me the other two. Well after he showed me were my bones were suppose to be and how off they were, we went back to take the last one again. As soon as he left and went to take the x-ray, I fainted. I hit the ground hard making a large scare on my forehead. The fall also didn’t help my neck out at all ether. After my faint he was pretty hesitant to work on me anymore. He called my mom right away and she walked down from work. He wanted me to go to the doctor's office or the hospital to get examined. So we walked back down to Edward Jones were we meant my grandparents. After we talked for a little bit my grandpa walked me down to ask him if there was anyway he could do and so he started to work on me some. After that I still felt like crap. So I went home and laid around. That is pretty much all I did all weekend. I watched A LOT of movies!! Some good, some bad. Today I felt a lot better. I started to do a little bit more stuff than this weekend. I drove for the first time since Friday, which probably wisent that good of an idea. I went over to visit Ashley. I knew she had a hard time last night and I also missed her. So I was over there for a little while, mostly using her phone to take pictures of her. I started working on my car Thursday. I went and got a new fender in lima which sent me back $70. I almost got it all painted. I have a lot of my car tore apart because I was planning on working on it the next morning but I guess there goes that plan. I will get it done soon. I also missed my Ham Radio Exam Sunday. Now I got to wait another month to take it. Well I am going to get going. Also if anyone wants a gmail account let me know.   Bye Bye!! Eric
