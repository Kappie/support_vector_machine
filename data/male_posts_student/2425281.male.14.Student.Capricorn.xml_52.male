Readers of this blog must understand that we all have lives outside of this blog, so do no expect everone to post everyday. As long as everyone posts occasionally, there should always be something new to see. (The benefits of a group blog...:P)  So just a word of thanks to:  Contributors: Without you guys none of this would have happened. Blog on!  Andy: For co-ordinating and the beautiful banner at the top! :P.   Readers of Introspective: Thanks for coming! Keep telling your friends about it, keep tagging and commenting!!!  I will try to register a shorter URL soon for the sake of our visitors.  Sorry about the formality of this post, but it had to be said. (Where would a blog be without an annoying disclaimer??)  Thanks again and I'll see you all soon!
