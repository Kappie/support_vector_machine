The sight of the "tree hugs" of Matt, Anton, Pat, Sam, Will, and Kevin Gray in Biology, Spanish, and during the firedrill was pretty funny. Especially when they all fell over as this big pile in spanish.  4. The book Fahrenheit 451 is really fun to read, so that explains English. Oh-and we get to watch some more Twilight Zone episodes soon!  5. I got a perfect score (80 out of 80) on my social test, so my table, consisting of me, Nathaniel Trulsen, Mary Speckhard, Saali, and Caitlin, was the "perfect table". We all got perfects, which was pretty cool.  6. There was no jazz band today, so I got the opportunity to go over to the Y and play pool with Will, Dan, Ajay, Mikesh, and Pat. Of course, I went. I think I played much better Saturday night-I got beat by Pat once, and Will like 4 times. lol  7. Not a whole lot of homework tonight.  8. Tommorow's a pretty special day too.  9. Orchestra. erm...afterwards ::wink::  Ok, so yeah. Today was a really good day, especially for a Monday. As for last night, all I did was the biology lab report (yeah...I kick myself if I purposefully ignore assignments), had some tea, played piano, and added a new constellation to my ceiling (I think that makes 9, including 2 zodiac constellations). Now when I look up at night, Aquarius stands faithful, facing Scorpio (I'm a scorpio). I had a good few thoughtful moments last night looking at that...mmhmm  I wish every day this week could be like this. Who knows? maybe it will. Well...probably not because of those stupid tests in social and biology, and that crappy Spanish packet, but you never know.  Hmmm...don't think I ever used this original quote in here...plus it fits. Who cares if I have 35 bucks now?  "In the eyes of gold I may be a pauper. Yet behind that stare I am rich beyond all imagination."  ~Bren~
