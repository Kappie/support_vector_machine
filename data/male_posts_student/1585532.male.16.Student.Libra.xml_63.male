I figured out recently that I was blind, and it sucked.  Just...wow.  Thankfully I've resolved everything with her, and I've found we're more alike than we knew..But I was so blind, only because I didn't want something to happen.  Turns out it was the same for her.  Now everything's fixed.  But being blind when you don't know it, its so horrible.  But thankfully, we told each other, and..wow...So much relief now.  Anyways, just thought I'd share it all with you.  Try not to be blind.  I always try to view it from everyone's point of view, but sometimes, its ridiculously hard.  But..we're back together, and all is good. ^_^  And sadly I have no catchy signoff piece so...bye.
