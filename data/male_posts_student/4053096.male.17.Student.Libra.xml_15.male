Karen said that we would soon have to start getting up at more reasonable times because we would have to start doing school. That's not any fun there. Afterwards Karen and Mrs. Donna went to eat at a luncheon with some of the ladies of our church. David and I were home alone again while they were gone. We didn't do anything bad or evil or anything menacing in any way, so that was good. It was weird today, the phone practically didn't stop ringing. Man, it was crazy. My grandmother in Nebraska, whom I haven't talk to in like a year or so (the reason of which is a whole story in itself), called. That was kinda weird and unexpected. She talked a pretty good bit. Whew, can she talk. But like I said, it was kinda weird.   I read a whole lot today. I'm reading the book  Midway . They cuss a whole stinkin' lot in that book. man. They've said d*** a billion times. sh** a whole bunch. let's see. Both of the B words many times. And they have said the F word like, at least four times, if not six or seven. It's bad. And also they use God's name in vain way way too much. They have said hell in a bad context a multiplicity of times, too. I hope my speaking isn't compromised by having to read such filth. ugh. Makes me want to eat marshmellows. That's kinda random, but for some reason it does. yeah.   Also today, our dog wouldn't stop whining and begging. It got kinda annoying after awhile. Silly dog. Dad had went out and payed her alot of attention, Karen had went out and paid her alot of attention, Dave and I did, she got a treat, she got to go for a walk; you'd think she wouldn't. Crazy. But after a while she stopped. Not sure what suddenly made her do it, but she did. The cat never meows or scratches the door or anything. He almost never even meows. Every now and then he does, but he usually has to go take a nap because it uses up so much energy. That's our cat for ya: lazy beyond belief.   I also fixed my chair today. There was a little piece that was sticking out, so I figured a way to put it back on. I hit my finger though. Oh, and I also fixed our sink bowl. It was out of alignment, so I pushed it back and one of the fasteners fell off. So I put that back on and then tightened it and the other three. I didn't have a screwdriver with me, so I had to do it with my bare hands, so I wasn't able to get them as tight as they could have been tightened. But at least it's on there now.   This evening, Bonny and I got to spend some time together. So that was good. We decided how, for now, our relationship is going to progress. We're going to continue as we are and see how that goes; which, I hope, goes well. It'll be different not having her around, but I think I can manage knowing that we're still together. Well, I think I'm going to head off. Talk to all yall guys later.
