On one hand, it was a great way for me to unleash the furies of my debating prowess and strengthen my own beliefs. And simultaneously, it was a weekend filled with malice and angst. So while I was becoming a stonger Catholic, I was being weakened physically and mentally in the process thereof.  First let us go into why my weekend was rewarding. I am one of the few in my church who believe that gay marraige, or rights for that matter is acceptable. This became a big topic of discussion throughout the weekend between me and others. At one point in time, I was sitting in on a workshop regarding the Church's views on certain political issues. The speaker came out and said how she came within a day of aborting her child, but a vision from God allowed her the wisdom not too. Very touching story. Afterwords, she went into checking off the do's and don'ts when it comes to politics and our faith. Capital punishment=bad, Abortion=Very Bad, Masturbation and Contraception = bad, etc. With five minutes before we had to depart, I had Samantha raise her hand to ask the question, "what is the Church's view on gay marraige?". Promptly the lady responded, "Why obviously we're opposed to it"  Just before she began to close, I raised my hand and asked, "Excuse me ma'am. Did you  choose  to love your husband? Was that a concious decision you sat down and made?"  Lady, "Well, actually, the Church does not believe that being gay in and of its self is gay, merely the sexual act of being gay since it is out of marraige. The Church calls homosexuals to live a life of chastity."  Me, "Well then wouldn't it make sense to allow gay marraige, thus making their actions inside marraige and therefore unsinful? Should I be prevented from living a full life with my partner because I was born differently than you?"  Lady, "Well, actually, the Church is pro-life. They believe that too people are wed and have sex to reproduce. Obviously two men or two women can not have sex and reproduce. Therefore, if two people have sex without the intention of reproducing, its immoral."  Me *grand finale*, "So ma'am, are you trying to tell me that a sterile couple shouldn't be allowed to have sex? They are just as incapable of reproducing as the average gay couple. Where is the difference?"  Lady, "that's all the time we have for today"  I then get a standing ovation. Ah, there are few things in this world that equate to, going into a room to learn a thing or two, and then being the one who gets applause. So outside of learning more about what I believe in and getting into constant battles over faith and our religious practices, I got little else out of the weekend. But that was a hella lot.  On the opposite side of this coin, I went in attendence with many others from my church who went to Steubenville, a charasmatic event. Lots of singing, adoration, etc. From what I hear it's eight fold what challenge retreat is. So half of my PoP people were running around me the whole time saying that this weekend sucks in comparison to Steubenville. That's cool to believe that and what not, but to come off as arrogant and opressive is quite another thing. It seemed like segregation. And personally, I would give up the chance to EVER go to Steubenville just as long as I got to see my brother put that golden ring on Elizabeth. I don't care what a religious experience that is, I love my brother more than anyone, living, dead or celestial. I fight and bitch at him, but he is my brother and I love him. So to hear I'm a bad person for not going, makes me a little angry.   To top that off, Jackie was floating around a multitude of guys, explaining how I mean nothing to her. It's that feeling you get in your stomach you know? Jake knows it, and I know it. And few things can erase that feeling.     The sun is always set on my side of the world...
