Dollface, dearest love of my life, I'm going to try to call you later, but be prepared to pick up for a phone number you don't know.  LadyNeptune - well, first get a shorter name ^_^ - and I'll try to call you, too.  How could I not try to get ahold of my favorite lesbian lover?  And Conrad - you're definitely the best friend a demented gypsy could ask for.  Even if you won't admit you're my  little  brother.   Sedgie  - were you wearing the necklace this morning?  I didn't notice - and we're so calling you Sedgie from now on. ^_^  To all the rest of you out there in the ether, it's one of those days.  It's one of those lifes.  And I've had the same song stuck in my head for weeks and now I can't remember a word.  It's something like "I'm With You" by some girl.  Got it stuck in my head in the bus station in Texas, and now I've lost it.  Lost a lot of things.  And I can't find the shirt - which oddly enough, is the thing that currently matters most.  I'll be seeing you.
