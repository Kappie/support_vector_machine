So I swear I'm just going to read this interview, and then about this gay rocker, and I do. But no, I can't sleep yet, because iTunes is slow at ripping CDs. I'm not doing that many: a Bree Sharp CD, a Sarah McLachlan CD, a song or two from other McLachlan albums and a Patty Loveless song. Should only take a few minutes, right? Nope. The whole process took slightly more than 30 minutes. That's my one issue with iTunes.
