So, my interest in people in general has been re-born.   As most of you can probably see, I updated Red Dress. I really need Bri to proofread it, but that can wait. The scene is suppossed to show the good in people; I'm not sure it does that great of a job. I wanted it to portray that Valentina is done with Dean, the man who got her sent to an asylum. The problem is that plot holes run rampant. Why would the narrator describe the wedding in such good tone if Dean had been cheating on Valentina? The problem with changing the tone to unhappiness is that it really wasn't Dean's faul that Valentina is a crazy woman. That scene will most definitely be revised before the final draft.
