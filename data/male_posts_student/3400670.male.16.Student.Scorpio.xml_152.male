I guess we're a little slow, considering there are only 3 days of school left this year.  Isn't that splendid.  We have decided that since so many people are disgusted with childhood obesity, we're going to do a little experiment on the issue ... So we're going to see how long it takes us to become obese.  This experiment will involve a lot of poptarts and chocolate.  Ummm we can't start right now though because we're sitting in history class right now, doing "college research."  Well, since this is probably the only blog that Livy and Syd will ever write - everyone have a scrumtrilescent summer and don't be too smart! - May the God of Poptarts smile down upon you all, Olivia Guest Pellegrom and Sydney Lauren Clos
