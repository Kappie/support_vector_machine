I know some people are just lazy, and believe me, third period just seems to drag on forever, but I think some also feel intimidated.  Everyone, well the only five or so people that actually talk always have really good ideas and are usually really smart, so others, including me, only think of the obvious when it comes to most of our discussions.  So either you don't want to state the obvious or someone else says it before you get the chance.  This has resulted that now when Ms. VA asks us all a question that no one really understands everyone leaves it up to the same people who always find a response that fits what she is looking for.  If people know they can get away without having to say anything during a discussion they will probably stay that way for the rest of the year, so unfortunately it seems that the same people will lead the discussions once more, unless something drastic changes.
