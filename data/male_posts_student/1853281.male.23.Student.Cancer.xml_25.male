They are fun, and we are so different from highschool it is weird, and makes me feel old. and smile.  did some power thriftshopping on saturday. Buying clothes by the pound is so fun, though the enourmous tab at the triple rock afterwards was not so much fun, though worth it. Sunday was a housewife day, with laundry and cleaning and than watching part of children of dune with keith. He hasn't read the books and i resent explaining, so there was alot of bitch face going around, but it was goodnatured. Leto atreides and prince faradn, graar, there is some yummy scenery. now back to the grindstone, so much homework, and some that i forgot about this weekend. Allready behind(sort of)
