To this person I ask:  Why are you a) so shallow or b) such a dick?     The "Away" Person part II-  This person signs in and immediately switches their status to "Away" EVERY time. To this person I ask: why do you sign into a chat program designed to talk to your friends only to walk away from your computer as soon as you sign in? Either you’re incredibly retarded and entirely miss the concept of internet instant messaging or you are a huge asshole because you think you are too good to talk to anyone.   The "Busy" person -  This person has his/her status set to "Busy" more often than not and when you try to talk to them they either don't respond or tell you that they’re “working on an essay/project/assignment” or whatever.   To this person I ask: If you are too busy to talk on MSN then why are you signed in? The function of MSN IS TO CHAT with your friends....there is no other excuse to have it on because it serves no other purpose....so what you're really saying is not that you are "too busy to talk" it's that you are "too busy to talk to ME or anyone else but a select few people who you deem privileged enough"...otherwise you'd shut it off so that you could do your work. If that’s the case then tell me and I'll understand which is much better than the insinuation that you think I'm too retarded to see that you have a "cool list" that I'm apparently not on.   The "Multiple sign inner" -  This person signs in ever two seconds because of computer difficulties. GET IT FIXED...it’s fucking annoying.   The "Frequent Name Changer" -  I can see changing your name to something cool when you hear it or when something truly cool happens to you; but when every three minutes you’re changing your name during every song you hear on your 500 song Winamp play list to some “deep” lyric is also really fucking annoying     The "Chronic Complainer" -  If you escape death in a car wreck, or overcome some scary disease or have a wicked story then I probably want to hear about it. If you have too much homework and the sniffles and change your MSN name to whatever daily complaint you have, you can go fuck yourself.  If it’s winter in Canada it is likely that A LOT of people are sick and most with worse shit than you're complaining about. People with cancer would give their right arms to have whatever you're bitching about instead of what they have....and if you go to school and you ave too much work or just pulled and all nighter, BIG FUCKING DEAL...EVERYONE has homework and EVERYONE has had to do an all nighter at some point. These people I also call "Sympathy Fishermen" because they complain about everything so someone will say "ooh you poor thing how DO you mange to get by?" SUCK IT UP.  The only people I'd ask that question to are people fighting cancer or starvation in 3rd world countries or kids who get every limb blown off by bombs in war torn countries; NOT you and your curable ailment...fuckin pussy     The "Vanishing Person" -  This complaint is NA if the person is drunk or stoned. If you talk to someone who is drunk and stoned this is to be expected...this person gets up from their computer in mid conversation and forgets about you....to this person I say: Get some manners and at least end the conversation or tell them that you will be back...I mean this is like putting the phone down in mid conversation and going to take a shit without saying anything. Where did you people grow up?   The "Grammar Police" -  This person feels the need to not only correct each spelling mistake they make but to make fun of yours as well....fuck I didn't realize I was writing an essay here, if you know what I mean then stop being a first class loser and grow the fuck up. If you feel like correcting every errant letter you write that’s your perogative but holy shit calm the fuck down when I do it.   This is all I can think of tonight but others include people who use way too many abbreviations. Like, ttyl, lol, and lmfao are legit but when you start getting into shit like hsiadaf to say "holy shit I am as drunk as fuck" and expect people to know what you’re saying you’re just weird....anyway, I started this but I bet it's nowhere near finished so feel free to add to it and send it off....
