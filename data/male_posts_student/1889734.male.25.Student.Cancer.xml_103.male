Interesting that the Left take the following position on Israel.  "When asked about his biased policies toward Israel, Bush launched into his scripted, inane, and totally incomprehensible spiel about how Palestine must first stop the terrorism so they can 'live side by side with Israel.' "  And this -   Move on. Nothing to discuss here. Given Bush's doctrine on WMD and on what constitutes a terrorist regime, why would he discuss the only nuclear power in the Middle East... the only country in the region that refuses to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty... the only country that defiantly refuses to allow inspection of its nuclear facilities... the only country that gives the finger to United Nations resolutions... the only country that occupies land belonging to its neighbors, and the only country that continues to attack and destroy its neighbors without fear of retribution every single day?   Me: THe only country that gives the finger to the UN?  What about Iraq, or even Iran for that matter?  Attack and destroy neighbors without fear of retribution?  Would this guy like to eat at an Israeli Cafe??  Remarkable how such virulent hatred is reserved for Bush, Israel and conservatives, while the murderers get a free pass.
