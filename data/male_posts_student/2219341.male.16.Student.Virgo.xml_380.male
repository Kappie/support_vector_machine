REAL  Christian aunts and uncles.  that'd be nice.  it would be some great Christian support.  i would really just like to know what it feels like to be surrounded a Christian family.  sigh.  that'd be nice.  instead of feeling alone as a Christian.  i mean my parents are both Christians... but you know what i mean... my extended family.  that'd be great.  but awww well.  cant have everything in life.  gotta settle with what ya got.  anyways.  gonna go do somethin constructive... haha yeah right!  whatever!
