I was late getting out of class, And I looked around As usual she was sitting by herself at a table, and all the rest of the tables were full. So you can guess what I did.  "Uh.. hi, do you mind if I sit here?" I shakily said, I could just see in my head he stand up and leave, but she didn't. She just stopped what she was doing. "Do you mind?"  "Go sit some where else, I'm busy" She replied sharply" Fairly taken aback I replied  "the table was quite big, and I wont bug you" So I sat down "Are you deaf? just leave me alone!" "I just want to eat my lunch gimme a break" She looked up at me for the first time, I couldn't see her eyes at the time, but I knew they were focused on mine. I could feel it, I don't know how, but I just knew. "Fine eat your lunch quickly then piss off,  and if I hear a peep out of you, ill snap you in two" Trying not too laugh considering how small she was compared to me I nodded my head.  Time passed and nothing happened, I stayed quiet and she never spoke, just drew... Finally I got bored and spoke up "So I don't even know you nam...!" Next thing I knew My head had smashed against the table and was being held down by one of her hands!! The other was wrapped into a fist held ready to strike me again. I could just catch a glimpse of her face, teeth clenched and her eyes were filled with with rage. She looked like a wild animal, and I was the prey!
