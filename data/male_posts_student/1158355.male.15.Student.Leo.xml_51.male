Of course on our way home from getting the shoes he said the inevitable "If your head wasn't attached to your head, you'd forget it." So I said "Ok Dad, your not funny." Until he said "Just imagine you coming home without your head and then we have to go back and get it and when we find you in the locker room it's just your head on the bench with headphones on knodding your head to the beat really fast while screaming. Meanwhile Paul's looking around with only his head and he's next to you going 'What... What?' The two heads on the bench not even relizing their not on their bodies." That was the funnies thting my dad has ever said. Seriously, can you imagine that? Well you must have a good IMAGINATION!!!! Ok... to me that was important, today nothing new except I had to actually rewrite a whole summary on "Theseus." That was annoying, let's see, what else happened. Track, easy. Oh yes, my cousin Kate and her friend Patrice saw me run and they were cheering me on so it gave me some motivation to smoke Paul, AJ and Matt in the sprinting straight away. Science pretty much sucked without Joe. If you haven't noticed, I love science, no I don't love the science class, I love laughing in science. Oh, and the most craziest thing that happened today was I was hit in the balls by 2 different Jared S's. First in gym, after trying to hard and almost throwing up my sandwich I was standing behind Jared Solenstein when he fell back and elbowed me in the nuts. Yea yea yea, go ahead Crystal and Julia LAUGH WHILE IM DYING!!! lol Then at the end of the day I'm at my locker and Jared comes with Toni and their doing the usual, Toni closes my locker, Jared attacks me. This time, Jared used his track bag WITH HIS RUNNING SHOES!!!! Ok, he hits me 4 times in the back but then I go crazy, turn around and BOOM! This one hurt even more. 2 in 1 day! I fell to the ground but then I thought of EVIL and DEATH and SCREAMING CRAZY VOICES FROM SLIPKNOT and I got up, grabbed Jared and threw him into the science labs. Haha, ok so what really happened was I got up limping and I decided not to hurt Jared because what Matt said, "He's so cute and small, he's like a teddy bear!" lol I can never hurt Jared, it would hurt me to hurt Jared, instead I kick the shit out of Matt and Paul and team up with Jared!!! MWUAHAHAHA! So nothing else really happened. I got home, did homework, played drums all night. The End.
