AUS$3.00 for a roti canai and thats the same price for a teh tarik. Crazy people. Should burn down their shops and collect the ashes in one heap and piss on them. Can't they make a suitable price for Malaysian students. Should implement memberships for student discount cards or buy 1 free 3 roti canai coupons. If i don't get roti canai soon i will go into "destruct" mode and destroy anything on sight. Mail boxes, cars, telephone booths, trees, dogs, you name it, I will destroy it.Have to control my self from going into "destruct" mode for a few more months then when i finally get to go home i will eat all the roti canai i can get.Muahahha. Tremble in fear Restoran Sri Murni, my return is at hand.
