I saw you stumble over rocks, And slip in streams, All for the sake of this butterfly, That you couldn't seem to catch.   So gently I lifted you up, And took you in my arms. And told you a truth I learned Too long ago to mention.  "Little dreamer, dreams are free creatures. You cannot catch them in a net, Nor trap them in a bag. Nor should you try, my friend.  For look! See this field, That you were trying to cross so fast, Is covered with beauty and wonder, If only you could stop and see!  So keep your mind on your dreams, But do not chase them so hard That you miss everything else there is to see!"  And then you raised your head and looked. The beauty made you gasp, And as it did, a butterfly flapped tiny wings, Floated down to land upon you, And made all your dreams real.   -- Andrea Smith
