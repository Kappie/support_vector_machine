I know this is going to all sound silly of me, but I don't want things to change. I don't want to have you come back and like hate me, or some other difference. I guess I am just paranoid or something, but its been going thru my head all day. All the people fooling around has me worried too a bit I guess. I know I shouldn't, but I do worry. I hope that isn't evil of me? I mean christen I thought was all like dedicated to derek and whatnot, and kevin is going off and having fun, and you have some un named guy hitting on you heavily and such. I'm sorry, I just jealous easy *sigh* I just don't want to lose you, that is what it comes down to. I love you and love having that returned, and i would never want that to change. You are wonderful michelle. see you in my dreams, where I will be alone no longer. *mwah*
