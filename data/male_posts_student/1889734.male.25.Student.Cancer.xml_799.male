Although I have to admit some surprise that a terrorist was actually killed in Saudi Arabia, but Saudis!  The Saudis have a long history of not trying too hard to find Islamic terrorists on their own soil.  You may recall in the hostage siege a few weeks ago, the Saudi forces allowed several of the bad guys to get away.  I guess that's what you get in a country that actively supports  Wahhabi Islam.   Saudi Arabia will never really be a friend of ours, and we are merely uneasy dependents for now - we need their oil, they need our money.  The Saudi issue is so complicated, and the longer we are beholden to their oil, the longer we're going to be forced to maintain this uneasy dance with them.  All the more reason we need to return to domestic oil exploration, as well as doing all we can to help the Russians develop and export their vast oil reserves.  Until then, we can't afford to let the House of Saud go under, so we are forced to play this game that we are allies.  The reality is that Saudi Arabia is a ticking time bomb of potential hatred.   urlLink 43% of the population  of Saudi Arabia is under the age of 14.  Couple young people with high unemployment, radical Wahhabi Islam, and a festering hatred for all things Western, and the result are quite predictable.  So for now, we have to help the Saudi family remain in power, stabilize the oil supply, and build up Iraq as a nice convenient staging point to exert influence on the region for that inevitable day when the Islamic revolution takes over a sizable percentage of the world oil supply.  The war in Iraq extends well beyond the War on Terror.  This is just the first stage in a radical strategy to finally confront the mess in the Middle East.
