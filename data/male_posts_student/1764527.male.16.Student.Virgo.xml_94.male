 Enewayz, church was pretty cool today.  Kinda.  Well, it reminded me of how unique my church is.  I was heading for Sunday School when a parent told me everyone was in the sanctuary and I needed to go there to get my scripture reading because the youth/children were doing the service today.  When I got up there I found out that I was going to have to sing "Let There Be Peace On Earth" with a whole bunch of 5-9 year olds and a few other "older" (read: middle and high school age) youth.  I was kinda pissed.  But I did that and after we sang (with the little ones sounding awful!) the entire sanctuary was dead silent.  To quote Mr. Barnes, you coulda heard "a mouse tipping on cotton." 
 But that's not the real reason why East End is so great.  During the prayer requests there were three requests that were, shall I say, unique.  One was from a little 8-year old girl praying for some endangered species because "According to my research..." (and she proceeded to tell about her research).  Her mother disappeared behind a pew she was laughing so hard, as was nearly everyone else in the room.  The pastor very skillfully said "Thank you, let's pray for all the endangered species."  Then, a man from one of the neighborhood half-way houses stood up and began, "I, uh, I don't really know where to begin.  ...  I'd like to become the President of the United States.  (complete silence)  I, uh, I've had this dream since I was fourteen years old and, well, I've always been kinda afraid of it.  I want to be President because of all the good things he can do.  I want to do those good things.  ..."  And he proceeded from there.  It was pretty sad because he said that after his "accident" he hasn't been able to follow his dream.  The thing about this man's prayer request was the the way he began sounded like he was going to say he wanted to join the church, or something simple like that.  The third "unique" thing about my church was when Francis Meeker stood up and gave us her weekly update on her life.  She will be flying Thursday on American Airlines to Chicago, form Chicago to Amsterdam on Kuwaiti Airlines, from Amsterdam to Kuwait City on Kuwaiti Airlines, spending three days in Kuwait City and then flying on a U.S. Army plane to Baghdad Airport so she can spend time with her daughter who is serving in the Army in the Kuwaiti/Iraqi area. 
 Enewayz, I love my church and Shana is coming soon so I have to go.  I'll be in Ashland City in about half an hour. 
 George out.
