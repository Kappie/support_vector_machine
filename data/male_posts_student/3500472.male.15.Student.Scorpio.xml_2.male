"big deal" your saying, "your supposed to look forward to graduation" WELL NOT THIS YEAR MY DEAR FRIENDS! k, i met this awesome girl who is a senior this school year and she is...unbelievable...you dont even know. well as i was saying shes a senior and im a freshman, and we have had almost 5 and a half months together where we have been going out, and i am not ready at all for her to leave. i love her a lot and im going to miss her so much, its going to suck. so, im trying to make the best of it by doing a couple of things for her graduation present, ive been making her a video diary ffor the last 2 months and im making her a t-shirt with pics of us all over it and if i can im going to buy her a bunch of gerbera daisies cuz they are her favorite flowers in the world (not carnations)but i have to wait and see how much money im gonna have left over, i should have enough though...anyways im really going to miss her. another thing thats going on is that this guy at my school (zac morris) is giving me the hookups by trying to get me a job at the storm stadium behind the scoreboard wall and ill be putting up the score and stuff, so be sure (if i get the job) that whenever you see a number being put on the board, be sure to scream GO BRIAN! that way ill feel special once again. ummm lets see...oh ya, im going to vegas a couple weeks after graduation and i dont want to go cuz my brother is gonna be working so he cant go, so im gonna have to go with my 9 year old sister and my parents...what a wild and crazy time...not...but im not looking forward to that cuz its gonna bring back memories from exaltation choir (cuz we went there for tour choir this year and Jessica ((my gf)) was on that tour with me) so yup, thats pretty much all the major things thats going on at the moment. so ill type out another blogororium later (blog is a funny word) alright check ya later -chunky watson
