Something that is sick of this world, things around me, something growth tired of everything.  Really hope this feeling would go away very soon before it leads to serious consequences like before. Really hope it does, it’s affecting my normal life, or, should I say, affecting my present “life”. It’s not normal at all.  I’m still searching for myself, deep from within. I had grown detached from this world. Nothing seems to matter to me anymore, TV, jokes and food; things that I would do everyday and like them had become nothing to me, meaningless. I used to love them a lot, I remember, but the passion is gone.  I seem to live in my own world now, with nobody around. Guess it’s because I can’t find myself yet. “I’m” lost in the mist of masking and splitting personalities. Which is the true “I”, I wonder. I really want to find.  I only feel relax when I’m alone at night, feel true when I’m with my drama friends. Even with my clique. I feel lost. I’m not myself with them, with everybody. I wonder why whenever I’m with my drama clique, I feel very true and real, though it sounds ironic. Maybe it is because during my worse time in life, they are the ones there for me, to comfort me. They only know a little but not all, yet they are able to give me support and comfort.  With each passing day, the pain did not pass away but instead it becomes more intense. The pain is killing me. I can feel it engulfing my internal, my heart, and my lungs. My chest aches. I can’t breathe. Why…  The long for that somebody to appear becomes stronger. It’s getting out of control. It is stupid to have this feeling, I know it’s stupid and idiotic, but the feeling and urge is strong. My life is in a complete mess now. I have never thought of writing blog, think it’s meaningless to write such things on the web, but I find comfort and console here. It’s like talking to somebody and expressing my thoughts. Maybe after I have recovered, I might jeer at myself for doing such a thing.  Life is meaningless, yet I’m searching for it. Life is meaningful, yet I’m still searching for it. I’m never living my own life, yet I’m still searching for it. I’m always living my own life, yet I’m searching for it.
