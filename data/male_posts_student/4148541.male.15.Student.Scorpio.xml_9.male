Dad woke me at 9:30 had to go  eat…mom yelled at me because she wanted me to go with her to City Center….but  for obvious reasons I declined…I was just too tired  and I did not want to be  seen in public with my brother either seeing as he does karate in the blink of  an eye for no reason…          My family is about to go see I,Robot  which I already saw when it came out in the states (it wasn’t TOO good btw)          So I am going to get some peace and  quiet time yay!          I hope I get some peeps to msg me  soon I need someone from IE to talk with! I keep running into 30+ year old men in chat rooms who want me to meet up with them in dublin and have sex for $$$        its getting creepy........              I hope you all have a good weekend      J              Peace
