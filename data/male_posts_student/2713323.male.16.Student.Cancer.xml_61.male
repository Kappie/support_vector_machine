DOH! and i waited two and half hours to do my bloody presentation and that botak just said, "im not awake right now, i cant think." then he ended the whole thing and told the rest to come back another day. what a jackass. when i came home, i dozed off straight away after a bath right through the night!!! now its 2.55am. shit, i overslept, forgetting to call hui too. and what a coincidence, right on the very night she posted "wat a girl wants....hehe"...and i have already broken a few. kk, let me list out the things i have or havent done. bah!  1. Guys should NEVER make a Girl WAIT... (sorry!! 45mins at mrt station)  2. Guys should be MORE sensitive to a girl's  feelings.. (trying to be...) 3. Guys should ALWAYS BE THERE for their GF.. (ok~)  4. Guys should ALWAYS be the BEST in everything..  So that the Girl can learn from u.. Yet DUn be  TOoo Arrogant... (um...always the best in everything? academically? no...) 5. Guys should MAKE DECISIONS... Not say " dunno  lar.. or anithing larz.." Girls like guys who  can make decisions.. whether is where to eat or  go or do.. Bleahz~~ (hahaha!!, eheh ok ok.)  6. Guys should be SMART, Quickwilled and  STRONGWILLED.. (ok, this one is abit hard to achieve) 7. Guys should never give excuses like  - SOrry I fell asleep.. (whoops!) - Sorry I was caught in a jam..  - Sorry my hp went Low..  - Opps.. I didn't know that..  - Oh i forgot...  8. Guys should Never use phrases like  - ya not angry r u? (when its OBVIOUSLY she is..) [ok ook!] - I dun like it.. ( when u haven't even try )  - I dun like them ( when u haven't even met  them )  9. Guys should NEVER be GAYS... [heh...kk start frm tml.:P] 10.  Guys should Learn to behave themselves at times.. (eh?) 11. Guys should Never force their GF to do anithing  they dun want.. (whoops.....) 12. Guys should always FEEL like a girl when guys r  wif their GF.. Girls like guys who can be their  bestfriend too.. Understanding.. etc..  (hmmm....) 13. Guys should NEVER always expect a GIRL to tell  them WAT THEY DID WRONG.. when EVERYTHING was  WRONG... (okay...)  i broke half of them already. im an eediut.
