Like, today I received an answer that I had been trying to find out, and you know what that answer is.....FORGIVENESS!!!  I must forgive people, which I try to do, but when I do..they seem to not like me :-S...hm...oh well, it's not my fault.  WHY DOES KELI HAVE TO BE GONE SO LONG!?!?!?!?!?!  I'm have withdrawals man...Oh well, as long I keep having little social issues, maybe those can keep my mind busy, so I don't think about friends who are gone.   This weeks social issue seems to start with a "K" and end with "yle".  So, I invited him over for my "Birthday Party," and we were outside by my trampoline, deciding what to do, and I said sumthin'*I don't remember what* but...he took it in the wrong way like he always does.  Then we decided to go to his house and get his LAN equipment so that we could MULTI-BOX HALO!!!  But on the way there we got into an "argument" about whether Jim Carrey was in the second Dumb and Dumber, and I knew that he wasn't.  Finally Kyle gave in, and I said O.K....and then he got really quiet.  Then right before we got to his house he said "You know, I'm not having a very good time, seeing as we're going to MY house to get my stuff."  WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY TO THAT?!?!?!?!?!?  Nuthing.  So I didn't.  Then we went back to my house, and we sat down and watched Boondock Saints and ate Pizza...but Kyle refused to sit down, and he didn't eat either.  It was obvious he was gonna be a little bitch, so I stodd up and told him that he was having such a crappy time, he could call his dad, and I handed him the phone.  So he called his mom, then went and sat outside until his parents showed up to pick him up...and then he told everyone else that showed up*Conor, JD, and Glenny* that WE were mean to him, and that we were "ungrateful"...FOR WHAT?!?!?!?!  Then he didn't come to Brittany L's.*not gonna try and spell her name...too hard* birthday party because me and Ervin were there, and he told her that we were "mean to him"....I don't know why I put up with him...I just know that this time, I'm not gonna fuckin' apologize, HE can apologize to me.....oh well, I'm beating my family at DDR and that ALWAYS makes me happy. Peace!  Spense  P.S. My internet is down for a day or two....so...don't expect me to respond too fast to anything....uh...bye!
