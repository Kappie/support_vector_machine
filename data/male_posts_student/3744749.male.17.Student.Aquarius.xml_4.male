Damn you!...Work free from the chains of apathy/laziness that bind you to this chair and fucking walk your skinny asses to the deli and buy food so you wont die.   smek...I could eat a baby right now. A really fucking fat one.   I hate bodies...they require so much maintenance. Alwayz halving too feed them and let them sleep just to repeat the cycle. blah.stupid hunger psychosis induced babble. But besides the crippling hunger, my day, up until this point has been quite relaxing. The intense relaxation has put me in an odd mood unfamiliar to me...itz pleasant... I feel very much as i imagine a monk feels... captured by everything and really everything in. Besides showering, i have pretty much been reading all of my conscious day...infac,t why am i wasting it writing in this stupid thing...
