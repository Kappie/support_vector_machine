Yes, I loved that show, especially the Halloween episode with Jennifer Love Hewitt...dun, dun, dun...I'm done.  Here's another classic Eric line: Ouchi Mcgouchi bro!  Feeny!     You know what also just came to my mind...and I felt compelled to type...was the classic show "Get Smart." Brilliant show! "They shot the wrong dummy..." -- "The cone of silence" The cone of silence...LOLOLOLOL...so classic!           While on the topic of brilliant shows..."Welcome Back Kotter" is a definite classic.      On a side note, saw "el hombre de la ara√±a 2." Also known as Spiderman 2, and it was really good...9/10...I like the spidey series, it's a hundred times better than Hulk or the pathetic Daredevil...but unfortunately it's no match for the ultimate comic book hero of mine [though I don't read comics]...Blade!      And now...*drum roll please*...  First there was "Blade"      Then there was "Blade II"      And come this December..."Blade: Trinity"     The trailer is up on the official site...bladetrinity.com...if anyone cares...it's in quicktime! :)  On a side side note...I think I'm going to accompany each idea in subsequent posts with a photo of some sort like above...I think it's cool and gives this blog more dimension.
