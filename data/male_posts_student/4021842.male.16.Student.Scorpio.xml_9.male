No friends, a family that thinks you are the shitiest person in the world, and various other things that have been included in my half lived, forgotten, shitty life. My so called "friends" dont accept me.   I Met this amazing girl the other day, her name is Kally, we have soo much in common. Only problem is, she lives in a different country and the odds of seeing her in person is slim to none, that saddens me greatly because i think that a strong bond is forming, or has formed. I can relate to her in ways that are unimaginable. It's funny the people you can meet through friends.  I can't wait till my friend Tiffany comes back from florida, she's one of the most amazing people in the world, i dont know what i'd ever do without her by my side. I wish i could see her more oftenbut it's understandable why i dont. She's busy with her friends, and herboyfriend, i hope things are still going well between them. She sent me a postcard, that really surprised me, i really was'nt expecting anything like that. Oh well, she's a friend and i certainly dont mind receiving something like that from a good friend. She's probably one of the only friends i have left. I wonder if she'll ever read this,meh oh well not to worry.  I really dont know what to do anymore, my thoughts on suicide are becoming more frequent, and i have a feeling that i might do it in the near future. I really dont have anything left to hope or live for. I'm dumb, stupid, retarded. My friends think so, I think so, My parents think so. What's the point of living?...Is there a point in life? What's my problem? why do i have friends who enjoy betraying me?...i really wish i knew the answers to these and so many more. I wish i could just find someone i can relate to and who honestly truly cares about me. I'm tired, tired of people judging me on the way i look. I'm tired of being targetted as a human verbal(and sometimes physical) punching bag. I admit i'm not normal. I'm me and sometimes i wish people would accept that. I try my best at everything but i cant seem to succede. No matter what i do it always seems to end in failiure. What's the point of going on?...it's not like i'm going to meet someone who might someday be my wife! HAHAHA that's a funny thought me actually going out with someone and ending up marrying them like that'll happen. Ha!  I had another premonition last night, this one was about my death. I've had it before and it's becoming more frequent. I'm really not sure what to make of it. It's beginning to scare me.  Anyways i think that's enough for my first post, i'm going to go cower in a corner and try to make sense of the hell i'm living in.
