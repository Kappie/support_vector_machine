For some reason, it was dark, like night time, and it was raining. Another thing was that there were no leaves on the trees, and it was a little cold, but not winter. So it was fall. One of my friends was walking with me and he was like "Holy crap dude, it's like, one of those clouds, coming out of the sky..." And he pointed and kind of stared in disbelief. My absent minded reply was "You mean one of those funnel clouds?" as I was fumbling with my shoes, tightening the laces as I knew we would be running soon. We had left the back doors and had only gotten as far as the front of the school when we knew we were going to be forced back inside. Cars and busses were stopping at the school. I went inside and there were news people there, and the principal was all freakin out, but suprisingly, no one was forcing order on us. It seemed as if they were all too busy, and freaked out, and trying to order themselves to order any kids around. I passed one of my friends in the hall, "Hey, do we have to sign or check in anywhere?" I asked as he casually walked by me. "Nah man, just stay like, near the office in case your parents come to pick you up." So then I was walking around, and then the next thing I knew, I was in my room. I had gone from school, to my house, with out even leaving. But there were news people in my room. With all kindsa crap set up. And then all of a sudden, the storm was over, and the news people left, and they had destroyed my LAN internet that I have set up. I mean, pieces of the router were on one side of the room, and the modem was snapped in two pieces. Just as I was about to try and fix it, the storm started up again, and I had to run for cover. Finally, fed up with all the bullshit, I woke myself up, and I'm now wondering if that dream meant anything...
