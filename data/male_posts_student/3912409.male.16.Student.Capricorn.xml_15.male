Wes was being a camping whore... he hid in a corner and used a gun that could shoot through the walls. After I gave up on that I went on to both Wes and Bret's computers and deleted Internet Explorer and installed Mozilla FireFox. Bret was telling me that his mom now plays  urlLink Neopets  and Counter Strike... lol so now they can play Counter Strike together.... and it would be really funny if their mom was some "1337 h4xx0r" as some 10 year old losers would say. Anybluh... after I messed around on their computers for awhile we went and played some Perfect Dark on the N64, Me and Wes VS. Bret... I think Bret got kinda mad, cause me and Wes kept disarming, which makes him really dizzy..... then some one shot him while he couldn't see anything on his screen.... but I'm not sure who kept doing that... *shifty eyes*... and eventually I went home.  lol, for some reason I downloaded the new japanese Yu-Gi-Oh episode 212... it makes me mad at how edited the english version is. -First of all there IS swearing in the japanese version -In the english version Bakura sounds like some old guy, but in the japanese version he ACTUALLY SOUNDS LIKE HE'S A 14 YEAR OLD KID!!! -The Japanese version also seems much... darker (in an evil kind of)  So I was trying to send 25 episodes of Hikaru no Go to my downstairs computer that has the DVD burner on it... but something crapped out, so I gotta figure something out, otherwise Bret will want his DVD-RW's back... and I dont really wanna give them back (he gave me 30 or so for free).
