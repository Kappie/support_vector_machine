If you have any games for me to criticize, please post a comment, or e-mail me or somethin'.      How many of the readers have played  Halo ? To those of you who have, so you're in a campaign with a teammate, and you have low health, so you have your teammate shoot you (or hit you on the back) so that you regenerate with full health, right? Imagine for a second, a S.W.A.T. team or military squad' of sorts performing this procedure and others that are performed in  Halo .     Sarge : OK, let's go.   John : Hold on, I'm low on health.   Sarge : Sigh, Pete' take John into that room away from anyone and shoot him. Make sure you use the plasma rifle; we can't waste any of that precious assault rifle ammo.   Pete' and John leave the room.    John   from the other room : I'm too good-looking to die!   Pete   from the other room : Sarge! John isn't regenerating! Are you sure there aren't any terrorists around?   Sarge : Sigh.   Pete : Did you just say 'sigh' sir?   Bill : "No Terrorists", ya had to open your mouth!   Sarge : Ugh, I hate hearing that line, I'm killing Bungie for it.       Another thing is Real-Time Strategies, the unit responses when you click on them. Man, they're so realistic, I bet Westwood talks to people from the army and asks them, "What do you say when your commander gives you an order?" And the guy replies, "I usually like to say 'This gun is heavy' over and over again. I never get tired of it."       The great thing was that  Command  Conquer  music. It was always great. No, seriously.       OK, I take that back. But the only time  Command  Conquer  music  wasn't  good was when the composer thought that smooth jazz or island music would go well with napalm and hand grenades.       In  Red Alert  though, there were some ridiculous weapons. First of all, the unrealistic weapons such as chronominers and mirage tanks and that business (you know the game started out as 'what if Hitler was never born'?), but then there's the just plain stupid weapons like parabombs. You'd think they'd want to speed up the fall of a bomb, but Westwood, they think differently, they actually slowed it down. That might actually do something for spreading lots of bombs out on a windy day, but it barely does anything with only five bombs. And obliterates the concept of accuracy. Why not just make a bomb that whistles while it falls (like those footballs with John Elway on them) and has the words 'Sincerely, Dubya' painted on the nose instead?        "All I want in the next  Red Alert  is dolphins with fricken sonars on their heads, is that too much to ask for?"    (There actually were dolphins with sonars on their heads in  Red Alert 2 )       Original  Command  Conquer  (also known as 'Tiberian Dawn'), greatest game ever. Had many pros, like weird storyline, an intro', a sneak peak at all fifty games that Westwood was working on at once including  Tiberian Dawn 's sequel,  Tiberian Sun . Also had its cons, like extremely pixelated graphics; as a result, whenever the commando spat (which was his 'idle animation'), the spit was the same size as his head.        Sarge : Take that Daemia!   Daemia ate Sarge's rocket!    Sarge : What the hell?   Narrator : Three frag's left!   Sarge : Who said that?        Command  Conquer: Generals , the dozer, he says some pretty stupid things. "Made in the US of A." Seriously, who says the prepositions out in an acronym? If you say, "US of A" instead of "USA", why don't you say "As S as P" instead of "ASAP"? I actually am willing to bet you, that unless EA Pacific (formerly Westwood) reads this and foils my plan, they will have the dozer say, "As S as P" in the next  Generals .       Some day soon, a guy at EA Pacific is going to say, "We should have the Crusader tank say '10-4' whenever you tell him to go somewhere", and someone will reply, "Isn't that a truckers' thing?" "No. It's an army thing." And none of them will realize that Google is a just a few clicks a way.       Speaking of truckers, Modest Mouse wrote a song called  Trucker's Atlas , which inspired Amir to want to go into truckering for a little while after college. It'd be fun, if I could tag along, and program better games while we drive, see the  billions , and  billions , and  billions , and  billions , and  billions  (which actually adds up to trillions) of sights. The song is one of Modest Mouse's best, except it's really long; in fact, a trucker could probably go from Washington to Florida before it's over. But go hear it anyway.       Sometimes one looks at these games and each of its little details, and one thinks, "Man, someone was assigned to that task." Imagine working at Bungie and your boss says, "OK, you, you program the gun moving while the player's walking. And make it move  more  while running." Sometimes you can tell who did the programming too. Like in the  Tiberian Dawn , you can tell that the boss' five year-old programmed the harvester pathfinder (which, apparently, is different from the regular unit pathfinder); you can also tell that they used the same pathfinder in  Red Alert . We have reason to believe, however, that the chronominers (which automatically transport themselves back to the refinery) were invented because they didn't know how to program a better engine.       Just kidding, no offense EA Pacific.       What's ridiculous is games where explosive barrels are spread out across the base. In Doom 95, the barrels of explosive poison were actually strategically placed, as if they knew that they would accidentally open the gates of hell and there'd be a demon standing right there. Who hides behind a barrel anyway? Apparently when you go to hell you leave your brain behind.   Another thing Doom 95 had was pools of poison. Makes you wonder what the UAC really was doing on Mars. Maybe it was just a side project, rodent repellent or something.        "I'm sorry ma'am, your husband died; and his body melted into the ground so the graphics didn't get too laggy."      In  Civilization III , it's funny because what do you do to solve riots? Give them entertainment.       "As you can see, here in Boulder near CU, there's another riot of underage drinkers demanding alchohal. The police are taking a different route to stopping the crazy CU students, they're sending in the clowns. They figure, if it worked in Sid Meier's  Civilization III , it should work here. And the clowns have special flowers that shoot tear gas."       In WarCraft III it's funny, the entire orc horde consists of eight grunts.       I would try and mock The Sims and the way they talk, but that would just get me killed.       Maybe I should have gone for quality of joke, rather than quantity. Oh well, I'm not redoing this thing.
