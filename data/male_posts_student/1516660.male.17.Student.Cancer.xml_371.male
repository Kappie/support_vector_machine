I am pretty angry at that Mr Lim. He used bloodlines and brotherhood to make me teach my brother Chem. (I did complain about it right? Never mind, hearing it one more time won't kill you) I was pretty pissed off. I can teach and I want to teach de lor. He doesn't need to be so commanding about it. Use bloodlines to pressure me some more. I am gonna make my brother fib and say that I haven't taught him. I want to show Mr Lim lian she (my annoyance)! Ergh!!! I am so fed up! Being forced kills my passion!  Right. I deviated from mah day. Right. We went to the library to do Maths. On the way, I told Gloria how CQ bluffed me into getting all curious over a non-existant person. Ergh! You ar! I feel so tired. I just slept. Heh. Tired sia!! Tired!!  Right. Be Right back. Appararently, 8pm just came.   Oh my god! Darren died! He died....oh my god.... Shock!! Shock!!  Right. Back to the day itself. That Koo Wen Qiang didn't come!! AHH! I wrote my interview so nicely and so full of emotion some more leh! A very difficult thing to do when you have commercials to distract you! Yes!  Anyhoo, we ate dessert. Then we waited outside the library. It's the big squeeze and running for tables again. I ran like a mad cat upstairs.   Well, we studied. I studied about 4 chapters. Exponential, Bionomial, Partial Fractions and Inequalities. Yeah. We met Hann and I went down to talk to him. Meow moo!  At4+, we finished studying and we went to Mac to eat large fries. Yeah. Coming back was meowful, then blah blah blah.  Ahhh! I am engrossed in yet another fanfic! Ahh! I can't concentrate! I gotta go read me fics. TaTa! See ya next time! Night blog!
