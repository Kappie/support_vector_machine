Anyway I went out to dinner (Red Robbin)with the girls (Steff, Julia, and Janet) and watched Shrek 2. It was a fun movie. I think I liked the first one overall, but this one had some good moments. I also loved the soundtrack. In the scene I was all like... "wait a minute... hmm... THAT'S A COVER OF THE BUZZCOCKS!"  Earlier in the day, I had an interview at Dietrichs in Laguna Beach. It went ok. Man it was such a nice day for a drive down to Laguna via the 133 and along PCH (on my way home). It was so beautiful and it just felt so nice seeing the Pacific Ocean again. I was thinking about all the colors that made the landscape so vibrant. The naturally ochre and tan shades of the plant life juxtaposed against blue green of the ocean. Thinking about colors makes me want to paint. I should hang with  urlLink Cissa  or  urlLink Crystal  and see if either want to go to the  urlLink Art Supply Warehouse  sometime.  I've been waking up later now. So that means less activity. I also need to read.  ***
