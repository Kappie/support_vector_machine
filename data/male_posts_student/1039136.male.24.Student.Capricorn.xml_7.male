So much happens in it that makes life seem all too unreal. If you sit and think about it, its amazing how so many tiny little things come together just for one small thing to happen.  It must be nice not to sit and think deeply about anything, to be simple and free of any sort of complication. I find myself quite often being cursed with having a brain...and it SUCKS!!  ahh yes...a journal..something to read..somewhere to post my happiness, anguish, and other sorts of feelings...This probably won't be just used to piss and moan publically about my life like alot of people's journals(now don't get upset peoples, the truth is the truth), though i'm sure i'll do my fair share of that,lol.  This will be used to jot down some memories i'd like to be able to look back on as well.  This is my time capsule so to speak. My life has been full of many interesting twists and turns ever since i've become a socially functioning human being. I've been through everything from the death of a friend to the death of a 4 year relationship on the bad side, and Being a pro wreslter to joining a Fraternity on the good side. Point here being i've concluded that in life there is no win or lose, it all evens out in the end...for every good there is a bad, for every win there is a loss, ..blah blah you get the point.  I don't think anyone has had it easy in life, and if you have, good for you, don't take advantage of it, appreciate it. My life has been kind of rough growing up.  In my younger childhood I dealt with an incompetent and irresponsible father (that i still have to deal with to this day) and my mother who was generally ass backwards, most of the time nuts, and not really there.  They had a way of never being there emotionally when I needed them to be. In school I wasnt much of a social person(for some reason i felt excluded and isolated from everyone else most of the time). If you combine those two things you have a hell of a brickwall to climb when youre growing up. Now somehow, I'm here...i've made it..alive at least..and sometimes well.  There are still alot of battle scars left over though, and here and there they poke through. I find myself at times struggling with life, and having difficulties with it that come as a result of my upbringing.  It took me a long long time to realize that I indeed do have some issues, and then even longer to do something about fixing them.  But here I am now, nearly 23 years old. I've made so much progress, through self help, through the advice of others, etc..Now that just made it sound like I have a terminal illness or something, but thats not it, its more of a curse.  You see, i'm different, and a big cause of my struggle with life is accepting difference, as my mother would often ridicule anything and everything she considered "different"(like putting clothes in a dryer).    yeah yeah..cry cry cry..  anyway...here i am, sophmore/junior in college, 22 years old. I should be out in the working world, and starting to get serious about being on my own..but instead here I am, in the sucky poconos.  There's a backstory that goes along with college and maybe it will be theraputic to me so i'm going to type it.  The setting is the years 1996/1997..I have aspiring dreams to be a pro wrestler, and I love watching ECW; the atmosphere is so intense.  I work at mcdonalds, and its a shitty job, really stressful, but is money and mom gets off my back some now that i'm working.  I'm the computer nerd of the family, as i spend a good portion of my day sitting online, talking to people, and just playing with the computer in general. Everyone in the family says I should go to school for computers since I'm good at it, so why not?  Apply to Penn State Main campus,and I think Wilkes and another school which is escaping me at the moment.  I'm not the best student in school but overall i end up with a 97.something overall average and will graduate 17th in my class....SAT scores first time around 1175 and had no ambition to take them again.  I've been in the gifted program since 1st grade at old forge.  I've gone to old forge elementary and old forge high school(which is the same building), the only "one town, one school" school district in NEPA besides dunmore.  My family is lower-middle class, we have a simple house. Dad's always working..on the road, at this time i think he's in insurance or home improvement, and mom works at either boscovs or sam's club. I have a little sister, 9 years younger than me.  We live in a simple house, nothing fancy and hell i have no real idea of what anything fancy really is, clothes, or other.  In School, i'm pretty much unknown, I talk to a few people here and there but not enough for it to count. I'm pretty much the quiet kid, i'm an observer of everyone with a life and if i wanted to be any more than that, I wouldnt know how because who do i have to learn from. I've always been somewhat shy and some even say "backward"..at this point i look 4 years younger than i am.  I dont know the difference between clothes from K mart and clothes from Structure, just because I was happy with just having stuff to wear.  Generally if you see me, I have the same haircut i;ve had for years, a really bad side part comb over, its really really lame, I wear tapered blue jeans, usually arizona brand from JC penny's, and a champion brand shirt, and the only shoes i will wear are Nikes and not because theyre a brand name, its because they are the only ones that felt like they fit comfortably.  At this point I dont think much of myself, because frankly no one else does...none of my peers give a shit about me. My friend since kindergarten, Chris, has been in a 'serious' relationship now for maybe a year or 2 and has a habit of screwing me over for his g/f quite often, and anyway i have no real life, I dont go out, i don't do anything.  I have another friend named peter but he's in the same boat as i am. My closest friend right now would have to be my cousin pat.  I hang with pat and watch and play football for fun, though hanging out with him is usually stressful for me all in itself because my mother seems to have something against that side of the family(guilt trips for spending any time with that side of the family ). So there i am, nothing to no one, and along comes a girl out of nowhere.  All of a sudden, this nobody starts to get attention from girls, and not that i havent had any girlfriends prior to this, but i've been in a slump for quite long enough.  The attention came after I joined stage crew for a play upon suggestion of peter's brother rob and some talking to chris about the girls IN the play. So..thus starts my first real relationship.  Her name was first brought up by my friend chris as being an airhead, but there was just something about that airhead that caught my eye.  Suprisingly, she wasnt the only girl in her class that had her eye on me, but all my attention went her way.  (How that relationship ended up is a long story in itself, but we're on the subject of school)..I fell in love with heather and she became the sole focus and care of my life as i really had nothing else.  She loved the shy goofy kid who looked like he shopped at kmart for clothes(and did), who wasnt anything to anyone in that school, who no one gave 2 shits about; she gave him her heart, and he gave her his.  I was in love for the first time, and for the first time i felt like i was somebody..and so what if i was just somebody to one person, thats all that mattered.  Heather and I were very different(and if  you read the above description about how my mother instilled how to handle difference into me, you'll probably be able to guess how it ended up) but we seemed to get along allright at this point.  I cant exactly remember how things were working out in the early stages of the relationship, but i think they were pretty good considering we were both just "kids".  Heather was always there for me, and though i was often embarassed about my mom being such a f-ing nutcase, she was there for me.  When it came time to decide where to go to school, somewhere along the line, a fight ensued between me and my mother(which wasnt uncommon, hell at least one a day), which ended in "I don't care if you work at McDonalds the rest of your life". gee thanks mom for the encouragement.  Well i did decide to go to school despite my mothers excessive pessimism, and chose to go to Penn State..Penn State scranton, that is.  I had to choice to go to main campus but i was paranoid about losing heather if I went away, so i stayed home..  I went there for 2 years, and in that 2 years time, i continued to work at mcdonalds, Heather worked at Mineo's pies, and things seemed to be going fine at home.  I finally got some balls, stood up to my mom and didnt speak to her for over 6 months, didnt rely on her for anything at all...i started to separate myself from her negative influences...notice I don't mention my dad much, he was never around, and when he was, he was my moms puppet.  Heather and i at this point were constantly on the rocks, and that seemed to be the only thing going REALLY wrong.  All the shit my mother put me through seemed to seep out in this time as I was probably one of the biggest A-hole psycho boyfriends you can possibly be...i wont go into details, i've had to face my mistakes enough as it is, but hell use your imagination and it probably happened.  Anyway, i had some new friends and we collectively called ourselves the Kommunity Kult...bad bad name and we had fun getting drunk and pissing off all the cool people...we were just a group of nobodies but as a group we made ourself somebodies. the year 2000  is when the hardship really came around.  My dad decided that he didnt like my mom anymore and got a g/f only 2 years older than me. Heather graduated high school, and at this point the tie that bound heather and I together was as strong as bubble gum.  The situation with my father worsened problems with Heather and I, as I began to question if i REALLY loved her.  I began to live in a world of doubt because the only thing i was sure that would always be in my life besides heather, my family, was exploding apart. I witnessed things go to shambles firsthand. I quit mcdonalds because my father had a new job at PA resources and was on the road to making over 100 grand a year, so he told me just to concentrate on school and don't worry about working.  So i Quit. PSU was about done with me so i transferred to the U of scranton to continue my studies. Not working didnt work out so well as when dad left, the money slowly stopped, dad didnt make much money as he accepted a lesser position.  Heather and I blew up totally, this along with dealing with all that goes with mom and day splitting, problems with friends, i didnt do as well as i should have at the UofS. Eventually the credit cards I had...which up until this point i was able to handle, started to get unbearable, since i didnt have a job and had no money coming in, the credit card+the mac machine was the only way to get any cash for food, gas, car payment, etc.  I had to get a job, and heather and I worked at PA resources doing telemarketing. My father hit a slump and though he had his young fuck buddy, he went downhill, when he needed money he'd come to me, who didnt have much to begin with.  Hey john, i need to ask you a favor, can i borrow your discover platinum..i need a few bucks, i'll pay ya back...sure dad....  eventually the bills got so much that paying them became the focus of my life.  I eventually stopped going to school after just 2 semesters at the U, heather and I had broken up, my life had hit rock bottom. I reconciled with my mother finally for all the insanity she had caused in my life, she apologized, and she was on medication now to help her out.  I cashed in some old mutual funds to pay off some credit card bills, but that eventually went to shit as dad needed more money to buy and fix a house and the payments got too much for me.  It was time to start scraping my ass up off the concrete after life had run me right over and start from scratch.. I didnt know who i was, as the only thing that made me me was heather, i didnt have money, i stopped going to school, no money, nothing...i was a failure...  Today December 2,2k2...Dad got his g/f pregnant, she should have the child in a few days, mom is struggling to keep the house and provide for my sister, i have HORRIBLE credit as there was no attempt made by DAD to pay off anything really, and fuck, where the hell am i going to make enough money to put a dent in like 50 grand of debt?? But there is a positive, i'm starting to finally find my niche in life and who i am. I'm a very blunt person, i like to say i'm an asshole sometimes cuz hell its true.  I love my families, i'm a very giving person, and what I want out of life is to get my feet firmly planted.  I want to be in a position where i'm not struggling anymore...i managed to get back in school, here at esu. I've advanced leaps and bounds socially..i actually go out, i worry what i look like, and damnit some people like me..people think i'm attractive now and though at times its hard to handle the attention its much appreciated.  I have a few good friends that i consider family and a diverse range of other friends as well.  I'm going to finish college in around 3 semesters which i'm looking forward to. My dad, still an ass...promised to help me go to school he'd pay for my car payment..and well...this one is almost a month overdue so i had to pay for it with christmas money my grandmother gave me to pick out clothes or things i need from her.  Next one is due in 9 days, yet he doesnt seem to show a bit of care.  I'm managing life pretty well emotionaly, but there are times where i just want to give up...i still find myself doing some things like my nutty mother used to.... but i'm doing my best to manage.  I feel like i'm too much for anyone to handle and put up with, because i'm so complicated, so deep and so different.  I've had alot of life experience so far, and i like to help people out, its like a hobby or something, but when it comes to helping myself out, its really hard because i'm so emotional.   This post has taken forever to write, i think i need a break...but hey..thanks for reading..who knows what will be in the next episode of my life...who knows...who cares? Hopefully by now..someone does~!  PS..this isnt meant to cry really, its just to kinda let you all know about some things in my life thus far... Goodbye  "I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away... I'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days"-Ozzy
