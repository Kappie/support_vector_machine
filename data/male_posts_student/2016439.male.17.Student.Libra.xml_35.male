I keep telling myself that I only have a little over a year-and-a-half more, and then I'm out of here.  Seriously, I just want to be on my own and away from people who want to run my life and tell me what to do.  Haha, don't I just sound like the typical teenager?  Well, good...I guess it's time for a little rebellion, after all.  I've always been a rebellious child, but it's gotten pretty intense these last couple of years.  I really just want my independence, freedom, and the space that goes with it.  I know I should call Katie, but...I don't know.  Am I a bad friend?  When I saw her in the hallway, she seemed rather distant.  It's kind of like that month at the beginning of the school year where she was mad at me and wouldn't speak to me.  A month is a long time.  Do I want that to happen again?  I know what I need to do, but...seriously, am I a bad friend?  I hope not.  I have a new respect for telemarketers.  We're on the phone constantly in newspaper and lunch trying to get people to buy ads for the  Echo , but we're still not even close to where we need to be to produce the quality of magazine that we did last year.  *sigh*  Oh well.  We're a hardy group; maybe something will come and save the day...not.  Off to more Italian, non?  I seriously love the language.  It just sucks that hardly anyone speaks it.  Maybe I can get my friends into it...not.  Whatever.  We played  Pillow Songs  for the first time today!  Ahhh!  How exciting!  We were working in a small, hot room, but we made it through.  There's a lot to work on, but I'm really glad that the people I have in my mini-band are hard-workers and are willing to put in the time and effort to make it great.  Many of them complimented me on the song, which made me feel really good.  It's funny how life can be good and suck so badly all at the same time.  Leave it to me, eh?
