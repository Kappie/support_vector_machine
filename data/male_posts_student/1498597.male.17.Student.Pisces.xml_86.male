Without him, well, we would not have the blog that we do today. So, thank you.  As for myself, I've been keeping busy making changes to my website and my other blog. I will be utilizing the "title" feature of Blogger that I just found out how to use! So if there is something that you want to skim over or have already read, you can do so with ease.  Until I think of something that is as creative as  J.R.'s  previous post, you will just have to wait. Ha ha! :)  Stay tuned!
