Sometimes I feel like I just want to go home and live my old life in Boston with all of the family together and getting along. Supposedly my mom and sister were "unhappy" but you could never tell that when they were actually living there. I think they're lying to themselves, but whatever. I miss the change in seasons and unbearable weather 80% of the time. I miss waiting for the bus and knowing how it all will happen and what I'll say and what he'll say in response. I miss the culture; that "I'm way too stressed and busy to waste time 'chatting' attitude. It makes me want to be better. It creates a thirst in me that I can't find here in LA.   I want to go back and I will someday. I will go home and raise my family where the kids know a little more than the weather, time of day, and local news.   I LOVE BOSTON!   Knowing me though, I will just wish I was somewhere else as soon as I live there for a while again. But I'm different now. I can feel it. That is all.           -- Feanor
