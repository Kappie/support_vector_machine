ITS THE FACT THAT I AM A GUY THAT COULD HELP!  grrrr.  really made me mad.  anyways.  that thing were guys are automatically characterized as emotionless, mean, stupid, etc. just really bothers me.  now i'll admit that MOST guys do have at least one of those qualities.  but not all.  i hate being discriminated because i'm guy.  i've never really felt comfortable around guys.  like... i've never met a guy like me that i could be friends with.  all my friends are girls... save for maybe one.  but even he is like a stereotypical guy a little.  i mean... im emotional... i cry... alot.  i get attached... i'm very intellectual... and sensitive.  i dunno.  ha... then that is connected to my frustration with girls.  i always thought that those were qualities that girls liked... and i guess they do since ALL of my close friends are girls.  but i wish i could be more than a friend to one... blah.  anyways.  dont wanna talk about that.  i think this post is PLENTY long enough.  i just had to get that out.  oh i do wanna say that Emma is awesome!  she's like exactly what i'd want a sister to be!  great minds think alike!
