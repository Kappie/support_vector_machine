Nothing really happened on Thursday and on Friday Juan and I saw Spiderman 2. It was a pretty good movie I guess...I liked it better than the first one. Saturday I did a whole lot of nothing. I went to this BBQ in Crosby thrown by some guy at my church, it sucked ass. My and two of my friends were listening to the radio in my car and it turns out when its time to leave we kinda drained the battery...lol that was funny. Sunday went to church and then my uncle came over and we all watched the fireworks between Jacinto City and Galena Park then later on went to Starbucks in the Galaria...not a whole lot going on to post about. Have no complaints about the way things are going right now. Things can be better or worse. Oh, one last thing...If you want to read my blog and get mad at me because you don't like what I have to say about politics...Well, you can stop getting mad at me and sending me vulgar e-mails cussing me out because you don't like what I have to say. My e-mail address is not where you cuss me out. I told yall at the start I don't care if you get pissed off or not. This my place where I can put what I want without fear of what people read...If you don't like what I say and want to complain about it...Get your own damn blog...Don't e-mail me and CC all your friends...That's just gay...Make your blog...Type what you have to say...Post a comment telling me to go there...Then we can have Blog wars...That would be fun. And I think I just pissed off the person even more...lol I DON'T CARE!! :) Anyways, I'm out...Later!
