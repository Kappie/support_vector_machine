I like b.r.m.c, that cd is pretty fucking rocking but the new promise ring I havn't had a chance to listen to much of it just yet.  I am going camping this weekend, but it looks like it is going to be by myself. That will surely be some interesting self evaluation time. Time like that can make you think about alot of things. I think mimi we come out there with me on Sunday after 3pm but I am gonna go out on Friday afternoon. I hope it doesn't rain on my ass. My tent is in good shape. I am always keeping it clean and patching up any holes that wear thin. This might be my chance to hike out into the primitive sites and camp there.  Anyone want to go camping this weekend?  My fucking leags are screaming mutiny!! I had a hard time sleeping last night because those things would never get in a comfortable position. I'm stiff - today I'm working out the shoulders. I can really see the work paying off in that area. There are lots of muscles I never really paid attention to. Still need to pay better attention to my diet.  Another ongoing battle for sure.
