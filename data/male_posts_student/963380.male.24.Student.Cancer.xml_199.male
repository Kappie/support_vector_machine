Inventory was quick last night - getting the file uploaded was not.   I was slightly disappointed that I had to spend the 60th Anniversary of D-Day at work as opposed to spending it with my family. My step-grandfather flew over Greece in World War II - on my dad's side. My Step-grandfather on my mother's side was probably off molesting sheep - not fond of the man, even in death. My real grandfathers? Who knows! On my mother's side he was probably collaborating with the Nazi's - Irish scoundrel that he was. On my father's side - well, I'd like to know. I really would. Maybe some day I'll find out. Needless to say, I'm happy to have the freedoms that I currently enjoy. I (and you) owe a lot to the few.   It puts this terrorism and Al Queda thing in perspective I think. The Nazi's were evil - evil in a BIG way. However, for the most part, from what I can glean from the accounts of those who were there, they'd give you a stand up fight. Neither side had any qualms about using every damned advantage they had, but they didn't strap explosives on their young and send them with cookies to their foes in the name of God. The culture of "The Great Satan" and so on - it's a whole new ballgame. How do you reconcile your differences with a sect of a people who think you're the very devil?   Venus makes a rare transit of the sun tomorrow. In North America we're only going to get to see the tail end of it at 7 in the morning. I guess I'm getting up with my welder's glass again. w00t.  And finally - sometimes a deal comes along that's just too fucking ridiculous to pass up. 5.1 megapixel HP Camera - retail $449. My price after rebate? FREE. Yeah. FUCKING FREE. The docking station is $20 BELOW FREE after rebate. THEY PAY YOU TO BUY IT.  I'm buying one in a few hours. Cause you'd be CRAAAAAZY not to.
