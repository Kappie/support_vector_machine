Other than those phosphoglyceric acid words.. lolx~  Had a great time studying yesterday. Sarah, Weichong and I were studying at the usual spot. Then a couple came. And the girl screamed,"I then don wan to look at your fats/ass/aeps?" lolx~ Then they walked towards LT1. Then Weichong suggested we stalk them!?~ lolx~ Yeaha. Sarah was the barefooted stalker. Reminded me of my sec1 days. When i stalked...... lololx~ Had some water games with Sarah. And some climbing games with Weichong. lolx~ thrilling..  Sarah and i wanted to attend prayer group today. But we knew no one. And we were like so late. -.-" Ok, i was late. She wasn't. Sorry~ Studied abit today. Photosynthesis sucks. =P Then Weichong and I climbed up to the other side of the science lab. It was real dangerous and scary. If we slipped, we'd fall all the way to mt venom.
