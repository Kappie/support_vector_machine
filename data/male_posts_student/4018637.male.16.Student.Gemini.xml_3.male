What if to let love between two people florish you take yourself out of the picture, leaving yourself hurt, alone and a firm wanting for the person still. In helping others you hurt or patensually distroy yourself. That knowing the one you love would be so much happier with another person. It is the best thing for the one you love, to let them go. But what about yourself, you have to evensually think about yourself. But in thinking about yourself you further hurt the one you love, making it even harder on them, and confessing yourself to them, making things even harder. Then reallizingit was selfish for you to do that and hoping that the one you made things so hard for..... will still want you. But through wanting you they hurt someone else. It really sucks for people. "I am so sorry Rachelle for doing this to you, in removing myself from the picture I hope you and Davis are happy together. I sincerly hope that you two are happy together. Just know that you are the only one I'm willing to do this for. Please forgive me for what I have done it was wrong and I am sorry".
