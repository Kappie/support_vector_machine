I woke up brush my teeth, had breakfast and started on the cards again. I've done 3 more and another one is still on its way, I'll have the links to them up here later on..   Why did I stop at the third drawing, cause my neighbor's baby ran into my house to escape form her Mum. She a sneaky little one, grabbing the chance to come into my house as my Mum went out with incent sticks or some would prefer calling joss stick to pray to the sky. I had to close the door of the room where the cards are, don't want another incident whereby the cards got stepped on and crushed like what my niece did, now would I? Hahaa... Had to open my arms wide open to stop her running around and slowly corner her back out the main door. Did I mention she was an Indian? Guess that does't matter anyway. Alright I'm as stuff as an over Size elephant plush toy after dinner. Think I've rested enough, Back to Work!
