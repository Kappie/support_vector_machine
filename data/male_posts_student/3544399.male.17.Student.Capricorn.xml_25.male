THIS MACHINE Performed by Julien-K Music by Jun Senoue  Amir Derakh Lyrics by Ryan Shuck   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Verse 1 A shadow of myself, just who am I? Scan horizons A tragic mystery You could have left me here, sealed inside the pod No one would ever know - The chaos control My true identity The power that is me  Chorus We all danced in fire Trapped in this machine Don't know how long we've waited As the Eggman's watching We all danced in fire Looking thru the screen Don't know how long we've waited As the Eggman watches  Verse 2 With rouge in the fight - electric lives Change surroundings A jewel in history A treasure disappears - as she goes Miss her as you look away - and no one knows This power is a key This power changes me  Chorus  Verse 3 E-123 You didn't know - now I'm gonna show you The power that is me YOu try to take me down-stop the show Seems you've never tasted fear- or loss of control The power lives in me The power that is me  Chorus   FOLLOW ME Performed by Kay Hanley Music by Jun Senoue Lyrics by Mathilde O'Rourke   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Verse 1 Anywhere you want to go Anything you need to know All the best in life I want to get it for you Lately I just feel so fine I imagine that you're mine In my world you're gold I only want to protect you  Pre Chorus 1 Whatever I want, I get, and I want a shooting star Whatever I need, I have when I'm with you  Chorus Follow me inside, outside Through the stratosphere The moon is shining for you It knows that I adore you Suddenly all the sadness Will just slip away And you will see what I mean  If you just follow me in my dreams  Verse 2 I was searching everywhere Suddenly I saw you there And my love arrived Just in the nick of love Life floats on a movie screen You're the star of my scene We live on the edge of a knife Larger than life  Pre Chorus 2 Whatever I want, I get, and no one could take your place Whatever I need, I have when I see your face  Chorus If you follow me in my dreams  Chorus If you follow me in my dreams   TEAM CHAOTIX Performed by Gunnar Nelson Written by Jun Senoue  Gunnar Nelson   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Verse 1 Once upon a time you could be a bad guy And you'd live to see another day But now you'd never manage- boy, you'd be brain-damaged Just to think that you could get away  The power has arrived in a dream team A force where one and one makes three And when the trail's gone cold and the lies have been told This crew'll find what you can't see  Pre Chorus 1 Yeah danger hides when the hyper bee flies And the ninja stars fly too The muscle is Vector, the karma collector And he's sworn to fight for you  Chorus Team Chaotix- They're detectives you want on your side Team Chaotix- Their directive's tracking down your crime Come along for the ride The truth can run but not hide for long- the game is on... now!  Verse 2 Remember when stealin' used to be a good deal And when a crooked life would always pay? Well... Now that the teams in town that's all gone underground But it's a worry to this very day  A Challenge has been issued by the Eggman This mission's gonna need them all And though his hope's grown thin and their outlook is grim These three are gonna heed his call  Pre Chorus 2 Charmy's thing is dishing out first sting And the green one cheers them on Espio is clearly ready to go Run down who'd do you wrong  Chorus  Chorus 3 Team Chaotix- Sonic Heroes- what your problem needs Team Chaotix- Watch those three go make the outlaws bleed There's no way you can win If it's trouble you're in They're gonna kick your @#$%! Team Chaotix!
