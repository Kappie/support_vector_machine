The left now is more willing to show their inner self? Reveal it all out? Anyways, they've given conservatives so many 30 second soundbites to laugh at them. The Hollywood elite aren't afraid to share their thoughts, and Al Gore seems to rant like a mad-man once a month from the radical moveon.org group, not to mention Hillary/Teddy Kennedy/or Howard Dean. Add in a little George Soros and they have a beautiful diversity in spreading their propoganda.
