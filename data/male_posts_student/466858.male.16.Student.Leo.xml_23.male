I would have to say that I enjoyed it, but maybe not as much as I would have enjoyed today's game. But I got a desk lamp and a pillow. Puts Becker Furniture World to shame, really.  Tomorrow is my birthday, but the Twins don't play. Just as well, because then I can go do something without missing a game. Plus, there isn't that chance for them to lose, which really ruins my whole birthday.
