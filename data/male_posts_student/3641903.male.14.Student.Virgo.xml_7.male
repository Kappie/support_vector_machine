When i got back up after my swim the goddam weather was still dam hot!!!! and the worse thing is my aunties house has no cold water!!!! oh suffered in the heat of the house and i realised when my parents and i was about to go back that i had lost my watch somewhere, gave me a dam bad fright because that watch was dam important to me as it was bought from my dad for my 13th birthday!!! that was one thing i cannot lost in this world, lucky the security guard at the swimming pool picked it up, OH the great relief i had. Then went to pick my brother from his swimming training at ACJC, then ended up back home with my mum just nagging non-stop!!! honestly dosen't that woman STOP!!!! it is like a stupid and irritating habit of my mums family to always nag and nag non-stop, the worst is my grandmother, she i partily death and when she nags, huh i tyell ya it is not music to ones ears!!!! due to her slight deafness her nagging is like screaming and nagging at the same time as partily deaf people need to shout tto hear themselves. oh well in wish i can just shoot everyone that nags at me, then all the problem i s solved!!! muhahahahahahahahaha!!! ok i am talking rubbish now so i will stop!! i wanna go watch world idol already, see how that polish judge SUAN people!! hahahaha ok bye!
