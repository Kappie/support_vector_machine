Luckily I get to take tons of Tylenol and sleep it off in this big, warm, soft, inviting, small, hard, lumpy bed of mine. I almost jumped out of bed and murdered my brother because while he was leaving he decided to make more noise than Hiroshima and Nagasaki (just about as much damage to the house, too) because he couldn't find his belt. Fortunately for him he was more than two metres away which saved his life. It may be boring around here but at least  urlLink fat people  are still around to entertain me.
