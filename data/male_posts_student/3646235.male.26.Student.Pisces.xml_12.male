I suppose I should let you know what I'll be talking about, if you're even interested.  I'm a graduate student and about to be married, so there's plenty to talk about there.  The wedding is October 2, 2004.  I'm excited, but more about that later.  I'll also be talking about life as a graduate student.  I'm a fourth year student with about 2 years left of research.  Lastly, I'll be talking about my struggles with faith.  That's probably why I started this in the first place.  I hear blogging helps people organize their thoughts, which is what I need if I'm ever going to get past this crisis of faith.  So, I look forward to posting my ramblings.  Don't know why people feel the need to read most of the blogs out there, so I shouldn't expect mine to be any more important that anyone else, but there is that feeling of, "hmm, maybe I'll post a famous blog someday."  Anyway, at the very least it will provide a written record of my thoughts.  Should be interesting to read 20 years from now.
