Car accidents happen, people die, and people get hurt.  The old pass away after their allotted time.  Of course, believing in how much time you have is a set amount makes you believe in fate, in which case you shouldn't be shocked by any of this.  Because hasn't your idea of fate decreed that these days would come? That you would be here to see them? How can fate exist if you have the free will to believe that this was an accident?
