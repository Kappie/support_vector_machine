Vince takes a needle and stabs it into his head and the gargoyle runs away screaming in pain. "Well that was weird," says Sa2b, "lets go check in at the hotel." When they get to the hotel they see a familar face. It's A.J. The hotel manager from LaLa land. "hey guess what?" A.J. asks "I got a job hear because I'm the only hotel manager in this swamp meet." Later that day, Camo and Katt go talk to A.J. to find out some gossip. He tells them that there is this morphing animal in this town that is a menice to the shops. He says that it approches as a sweet little kitty cat and than it turns into a giant tiger and starts to destroy the shops. If it gets made than it will transform into a gargoyle and wreeks havoc until it calms down, then it goes away. *Camo's eyes go blank and you zoom into his pupils going into a flashback. You see a baby Camo (isn't he so cute). He is playing with a kitty cat and it morphs into a tiger and it starts to carrie camo around in its mouth. Zoom out of Camo's eyes.* Katt says "Camo whats wrong." "I don't know." Camo respondes. "Oh well, lets go out." So Camo and Katt go around the swamp meet spending time with each other, going on all the rides. After they get off the newly built roller coaster, they see a black cat, (it's so cute). Camo and Katt decide they want to keep him,(it's a boy cat), so they bring it to Sa2b to ak him. Camo: Can we keep him. Sa2b: No. Katt: Can we keep him. Sa2b: No. Camo and Katt: Can we keep him? please, we will take good care of him. Sa2b: Fine, but you have to pay for the food. Camo: Why? Sa2b: Because I pay the rent. Katt: No you don't, we don't have rent. Sa2b: Um.....ah.....shut-up. After all this, they name the cat DarkBlaze, after the legendary animal. Little did they know that the cat they picked up was actully the one and only DarkBlaze and the same cat that played with Camo when he was young. When they got home, something was amise.  Part 2 later. -Darkblaze-
