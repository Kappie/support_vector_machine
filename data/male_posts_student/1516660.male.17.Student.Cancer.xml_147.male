No more egg puns. Today, we were tested on A-Maths. But I will go there later. First, I wanna talk about me giving prezzie to my "mo-te-er" (okay okay ...mortal). My Grand Finale. This is actually plan 5 you know! The first plan failed, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th plans were abandoned. I only made up Plan 5 while on the bus to Admiralty Popular. Plan 5 is: giving Wendy "The Official Hamtaro Guide" (or something like that la). HaHa! She was so happy you know! She's so pleased with her prezzie! I feel so happy giving it to her. Finally! :D  Today's A-Maths was the easiest man! Or so everyone thinks. Even Wendy was so happy doing it. I think I cna get quite good marks la. I think. I hope. Meow meow!!  After that, CQ and me stayed back to wait for Gloria and XC to eat with us. What an agonizing 2-hour wait! At first, we were so bored. So, we decided to create Bio MCQ questions to do la. But we only came up with two..hahaha! Then, we borrowed Hann's TYS to test ourselves MCQ till 11 something. Hann, Clar, MeiYing and Sonia then joined us and we gossiped. About teachers marking our scripts ar, about this and that. Hann even wanted to throw his bottle down to hit the Cheung Cheng High kids when they came in the school (we were sitting on the benches outside teacher's offices). HaHa!   Then, at 12, we (along with XC, HL, Gloria and KeYun), gathered around the hungry Mrs Chua to ask her Bio questions to clarify our doubts. She then told us we did okay, and not to worry la, because she has confidence in our Paper 1. Yep! :)  We, the original bunch, plus Hann, went to Causeway Point to eat. On the bus hor, they keep teasing me you know! I was so paiseh until I said "qi shi wo! bao xue guan" like WanWan! HaHa! Everyobdy laughed. :D We went to Causeway to eat. But hor. In order NOT to be the one to ba wei and wait for everybody, I rushed off first. And they decided to punish me by shifting to another table. Woah! Find so xin ku you know!  After we finished eating, we went to Value Shop to buy sweets for Ji and went to the library to help Sonia return book.  I came home at around 2.10 or so. took a bath. I originally decided to study Bio one, but got sian after reading the first page. I went online, then played the Sims (which I haven't for a long long time!). After that, I went online to chat with Wendy! YaY!! Tomorrow can bake cake at Wendy's house le! YaY!! I am so excited! I wanna bake nice tasty cakes! And fry eggs too. I am teaching Wendy how to crack open eggs. HaHa! So excited!  After dinner, I slept a while during Holland V. Too tired, I guess. Then, UI decided to study my Bio. I am quite weak in certain subjects! I must take note of my weakness. Then Uncle Steven came to look at my computer, so he can buy the correct equipment. YaY! I am getting a CD-RW, a new scanner and new RAM. YaY!   After that, I went online lor. Ayiah. I tuoed this blog until very long le. Keep getting distracted and all. I am gonna end here le. See ya tomorrow! Goodnight blog!
