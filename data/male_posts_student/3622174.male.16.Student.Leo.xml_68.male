I put a lot of work into this place today, and I certainly hope it pays off.  I went through and edited a ton of HTML, and the sidebar has some sweet new features, like the chat box, the guest book, and a contact me section.  I couldn’t be prouder of myself.  And, if you detected sarcasm in that, congratulations, you receive one bagel point.  That point is redeemable for absolutely nothing.    So, last night, I walk into my bathroom, and I see something that I never expected to see in my life.  No, it wasn’t a toilet full of crap and stuff, you sick freak.  It was actually sitting on the edge of the bathtub.  It was a half-eaten, cream cheese-infested bagel.  And it made me think: who the hell eats a bagel in the bathtub?  Nobody that I know.  I wanted to get a picture of it, but it was 12:30 in the morning, shortly after I got done posting that last entry yesterday.  I was too tired to even go look for it.  I came back this morning to try and get a picture of it, but I couldn’t find it.  Weird?  Yeah, but, I do know for sure that I wasn’t dreaming.  There was a lump of cream cheese in its place when I went to look this morning.  Now, normally, I’ll go on and on about how bored I get, but that’s not the case today.  I actually had fun researching the information for today’s 4 bagel.tech posts, and I’m definitely looking forward to building a database of information on stuff to do online.  If you haven’t checked it out, today I looked at a game called Zuma, went to a site called Home Star Runner, played with an application called jetAudio, and gave readers an inside tip on how to pick the best web browser for your computer.  You can go to bagel.tech by clicking the bagel.tech link in the “bagel’s blogs” links section.  Now, on with today’s regular blogging features:   The Worst Pool Player Ever?  Yep, that probably describes me.  We have a pool table at my house, and one of my brother’s friends came over today, and my brother decided to sleep for a few hours, so I decided to play pool with this kid.  Now, this kid wasn’t that great at pool, but, let me tell you, I was worse.  It took me so many tries to even knock the balls into the pockets...I felt so dumb.  I only won 1 of the 4 games that we played.  Yep, guys, I lost to a 13 year old.  But, not to worry, because if he ever comes back, I’m going to get him twice as bad.   Playstation Breakage  Well, looks like my Playstation broke, yet again.  At least, I think it did.  It’s not loading discs right.  Now, the first time my PS2 broke, it was because my brother accidentally knocked it down the shelf, and we had to practically buy a brand new one.  So, I called Sony today, and they won’t fix it.   It’s an internal error, the disc I put in keeps giving me errors.  Now, if they want to keep a strong user base when the Playstation 3 comes out, then I suggest they get better customer service reps, because the one I talked to was nasty.  So I just hung up.  Maybe it’s just that one particular game, but, that just really irritates me that Sony isn’t nice.   Things are Speeding Up  For some reason, time is just flying by all of a sudden.  It feels like 2 hours ago that it was 12:30 in the morning when I encountered that bagel, but, no...it was actually so long ago.  These past couple of days have just flown by so quickly, that it seems like school is going to be starting even quicker and quicker.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, I’m not sure, but, pretty soon I’m going to want things to slow down a bit.   Spiderman 2 Hype  The day is getting so much closer, and closer, and closer.  Wednesday, June 30th is the date that Spiderman 2 will be in theaters.  I’m still a little irritated about that commercial that I saw for it last week, the one that practically revealed most of the plot to me.  I didn’t want to know that Harry finds out who Spiderman is until I saw the movie.  I didn’t want to hear that Mary Jane was going to marry Jameson’s (the Daily Bugle guy) son, or whoever that was.  And I really didn’t want to know that Peter was going to give up being Spiderman for a time.  So, that whole thing ruined it, but, I’m trying NOT to let it get to me.  The movie is still going to be good.  Well, that’s it for tonight’s edition of The Blog of the Bagel.  I may update again later tonight, but, after all this blogging that I’ve done today, I’m spent (Haha Courtney, that’s your phrase).  So, if you don’t see me again tonight, be sure to vote in this week’s poll, which is conveniently located on the sidebar.  That will help tell me what I need to do to this blog to make it better.  Anyway, tomorrow is Saturday, so if you get bored, be sure to check out the bagel.tech posts, and then I’ll have an entry for here tomorrow night.  That’s so much blogging, but, hey, I’m really liking it.  Also, be sure to sign the guestbook, and if you want, you can use the chat box, but, I’m pretty sure I don’t have too many people stop by here anyway ;).  Until next time, keep blogging.
