Today was probably the laziest day I've had this summer, with almost no sports included whatsoever, but meh other than that it was all good =). 'Sides after 3 straight hours of ball yesterday, a day of rest is good. Plus yesterday I FINALLY got a pair of Green Adidas Track Pants, though not the ones I was aiming for but hey it'll do for now =). Yesterday was actually a pretty long day when I think about it, waking up at 10am, sleeping at 3am. Then this morning...  I wake up at 12pm, after a well rested night. Jason was supposed to come over by this time, but apparently he didn't wake up until 1pm so yeah that was delayed a bit. So I went downstairs, ate, then did usual morning routine, sat around, and lazied about the house for a while. PS2 was the main form of entertainment for the majority of my afternoon. Lunch today consisted of "joak," which wasn't so bad I guess. Originally today I was going to go to see how I did on my exams, but then decided not to with laziness as the main motivator and sleep leading the way. So after lunch, I just sat around until Jason came, where afterwards we still played more PS2 haha.  Today though I found out that my uncle has a new sound card. Creative Audigy 2 or whatever...I know it's a whoop-ass card basically. I find it funny how he used to not care about his computer, and last few months he's bought 5-pc speaker system, grabbed my old monitor for larger desktop, and his video card. OH YEAH and a all-in-one printer, all within last 2-3 months.  That's almost 600 bucks or so spent on new compy junk. I found out this stuff when I went over to grab my Kill Bill back...but yeah recently all I got were speakers. 3 piece....I crumble to 5-pc systems.  Well when I walked back Jason just got there so yeah we PS2'd for most of the time. Then mom wanted to watch some TV so Jason went on compy while I went to grab some food. Jason was about to go to miniclip.com, but then I showed him the game "Defend Your Castle" on Arcadetown.com. Within minutes he was addicted the same way I was when I first started to play it, and then showed John the game and then he got addicted to it. Somehow though Calvin doesn't like it....which then led to this quote from Jason:  "So....let me get this straight. People who have an intelligence find this retarded game amusing, yet people who don't like to think don't like this game? WTF has this world come to?"  By the way, if you want to see the game,  urlLink here it is.   So after playing that game for an hour *yes we were bored, and I got tired of food GASP* we then returned to PS2, where then we played until Jason left around 6pm or so.  Afterwards I watched some TV, MSNed, and then called up Patrick to go play some ball. We played some 1-on-1, where I beat him 7-3. But then when we played a game with shots only....he won 7-5. Only reason why I came so close that game was because I fouled him whenever he shot, and did a lot of kickball that we never called hahaha. But that just shows how horrible my shot really is, which is why I have to work on it =P. Was funny watching Patrick try to do some handlin' skills...yeah he needs to work on that =P.  Well anyways yeah that was the most of my day, now I'm just bloggin', MSN, and probably gonna sleep soon. Gotta do devos tonight like I promised haha. Also gotta wake up for Job interview tomorrow...well volunteer. Library needs interviews however, so yeah pray for me guys n' girls for that, and also tomorrow goin' bowlin' with the HYPE kids...and and will also be the last time I see Steph =(....until August that is =P.  Anyways I'm out. Later.
