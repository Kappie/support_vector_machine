Well we're are in the midst of March Break, and oh how sweet it is. Staying up late watching infomercials, and having some guy try to sell you a knife that can cut through a boot, and sleeping in to rediculously late times, just for the hell of it. Here's a rundown of what's gone on so far:  Friday: The March Break started off rather nicely, with a trip to a hockey game. No, not the Leafs... no, not the Bulldogs... ok, so it was my friend Meg's brother's juniour hockey game, but it was still hockey. They lost 6-3, but it's the thought that counts. After the game, we headed to "The Attic" where we PARTIED TO THE BREAK OF DAWN! Ok, not really... Meg's parents were nice enough to take us out for pizza, and then we left around 9:30 to head back home and just hang out. Watched some Seinfeld (that show never gets old), and then headed home.  Saturday: LEAFS VS. CANADIENS! Wait, the Leafs lost... boy, that game really sucked. It was still a fun night, as Vince and Randy came over for the game, and we proceeded to make fun of random people that came on TV. Most significantly, a white Canadian rapper named "Eamon". It was just too easy. Later that same night, Sarah, Steph and Meg came over to hang out for a bit. This was Sarah's last day before she headed for Washington. Fun was had, and then we all walked them back to Meg's house, and then had a RACE home. I dropped out after three or four paces, but eventually caught up in time to see Vince just slightly beat Randy to my door. Good times.  Sunday: Wrestlemania day. What more can be said? Well, The Triad (Me, Shawn, Randy) just hung out the whole day, in a fairly empty house. We played EUCHRE (!!!), ordered pizza, and watched Wrestlemania X-7 on DVD, all in preparations for Wrestlemania XX. A great show, hi-lighted by my brother's friend finding faults in EVERY SINGLE MATCH ON THE CARD. I swear, i've never heard "Oh, that's so terrible" or "Oh, that's just awful" so many times in one night. Still, a fun night capped off by a midnight drive home with "Hey Ya" cranked.  Monday: Ah, the first REAL day of the March Break. Great to hear my alarm go off at 6:30, and be able to just sit back and relax and enjoy the hilarity that is the 102.1 The Edge morning show. Great day all around, as I headed to Vince's to watch THE LEAFS play the Buffalo Sabres. Also there was Steph and Meg, as we played a rousing game of SCRABBLE, as well as FROG SOCCER. We then watched as the Leafs came back from 5-2, to win 6-5 in Overtime. What a game. Also a great night due to the fact that I beat Vince TWICE at ping pong. I also beat Steph, but well... that was a given.  So yes, the March Break has been kind to me so far. It's Tuesday now, and it's snowing... but meh, it'll clear up. Dear God I hope it clears up.  So that's all for now, check out for Randy (Uh, I mean... Legacy X *looks around mysteriously*) to make a new post. Later kids.
