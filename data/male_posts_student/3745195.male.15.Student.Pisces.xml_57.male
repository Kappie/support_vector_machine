They called earlier and they just called a few minutes ago (they're at a Clay concert and they called me to let me listen) That was kool. Well not much else happened today. Yeah, but doing nothing was worth getting those phone calls.  Love you all Bye   "Just thinking of you makes my life even better, and just knowing you care makes me feel whole. You'll always be my friend and forever the one I love."
