I have to wait until October (the 25th to be exact) when the Christmas specials are released on DVD to see the end of  urlLink  The Office  .  Tomorrow I'm going to see the new Harry Potter movie   Harry Potter  The Prisoner of Azkaban  . I've been reading about how great it is. I hope it's not a let down.   In other  Harry Potter   news, I stumbled upon J. K. Rowling's  web site . It's got a lot of cool Harry Potter updates on it.   As reported by CNN, John Kerry made  urlLink a visit  to the Vietnam memorial on Memorial Day.  In more important news...  I was surprised to learn about what  urlLink really happened  on Memorial Day when John Kerry went to give a speech for a bunch of school age children at the Vietnam Memorial in D.C.. The whole story, to my dismay, was not aggresively reported by the media as it should have been.   To summarize the story, John Kerry became upset when Ted Sampley, a Vietnam veteran and head of the  urlLink Vietnam Veteran's Against John Kerry , was heckling the Massachusetts senator as he was speaking to some school children. Rather than handle the situation like an adult, he gave the middle finger to the vet. If you don't believe it, you can also check out the report in  urlLink The Washington Times . There are also confirmed news sources that were  urlLink present .  To be fair, though, you can check out the history of Ted Sampely as viewed by some Kerry supporters  urlLink here .  Another surprising article that I read was also about Kerry, but it was also about his   urlLink connection to 9/11 . This is very plausible. Afterall, he is the senator of Massachusetts.   I'm not really surprised that none of this was reported by any of the larger news outlets. I'm disappointed, really.
