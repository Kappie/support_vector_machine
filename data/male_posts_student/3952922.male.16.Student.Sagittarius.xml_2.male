And some never ending glamour filled Indian drama on star plus among my options to watch. But never in my wildest dreams did I imagine seeing the "ali brothers" on PTV nighttime transmission. *Sigh* Wasn’t IM requested and Alizeh's favorite enough???? Why I took the pain to watch them for three full hours, you ask? Well, I couldn’t really miss the perfect combination of the guests and hosts. I mean, many of us would dread facing our ex's but doing that on national TV??? Ha ha...that's gotta be interesting...yes, along with Noor and Nadia was the humpy jumpy longhaired beauty (?) Mandana zaidi...for those of you who don’t know her.... she’s the same gal seen in all noori videos.... the one who tries high kicking in "tum hans diyey”. And was recently seen in jawad Ahmed's new song, tak dhina din. Oh and most importantly ,she happens to be his ex too. *sigh* The show started with the three hosts and the two guests striving to make a conversation. Mandana kept her eyes fixed on her hands. Even when she did speak, the words she used were “aap, jee, bolien”… ali noor and ali hamza kept running their hands in their thick hair.... the kind any girl wud kill for. Thank God they aren’t 100% girls.... I wud die if any girl besides me had that hair. A while later they acquired a mischievous tone, which didn’t fail to produce sly smiles on Mandana’s face. During the show, a few calls were placed to the Ali brothers’ family and friends and when Mandana called their parents ‘uncle and auntie’ and they replied with ‘tum’, all doubts in my mind were cleared. The show continued with Ali Noor blabbing endlessly. He even dissed Mandana twice. Ali Hamza backed him up with his occasional “Hun-Haan”. He sang his unreleased tracks “Merey kakya ki” and “gawal mandi”(that’s so unfair for BC, ainnit? *winks*) Yawning, I decided to switch the TV off but just then the phone calls were taken on air and finally the ‘fun’ part was here. There was a usual attack of the noorites at first, who seem to jump out of the receivers. Ali Hamza was receiving loads of requests to sing a song again but Ali Noor (read: the conceited one), sang manwa rey instead. The two even disclosed the fact that the initial plan was to have Ali Noor on the guitars and Ali Hamza on the vocals, which thank God didn’t happen! It hurts me to know there’s still space left for the band to sink lower*sigh*The most frequently asked question was “aap baal kyun nahi katwatey?”, which made Ali Noor get that “what-the-hell-is-your-problem?” look on his face. The end was near and yet nothing out of the blues had happened. It got me wondering where all the anti-noorites were? (Oh! And I did try to call in but couldn’t get through!) My eyes started to pain since I had already rolled them a gazillion times but the last three callers made it worth it. The conversation was something like: Caller1: Ali jee, my name is Amna .Do you remember me? We have met! Noor: I would know you by face Amna. Caller1: I’m the same girl who met you in Murree’s Usmania when you were with                 Anushay .You gave me an autograph on my bill. Noor (*blinks*): Uh, yeah I remember you. (Phone line disconnected) Host: Oh-Ho, disconnect hogaya… try again. …………………………………………………………………………………………. Caller2: Hey! I wanted to ask Ali Hamza how he came up with his song BC? What’s                 story behind it? Mandana (ever-so-eagerly): Jee, your question has been noted down. I’ll soon ask                                                  Hamza. And so she did. Twice (most probably in order to get back at Noor for dissing her). The first time Hamza ignored it slyly. The second time Mandana emphasized and Hamza blinked, looked blank and said,”kaunsa gana?” Talk about lameness! Ali noor barged in and changed the topic and this time Mandana let go. The third caller was the most interesting one. Caller 3: hello, I am blah blah. I have heard that Mandana zaidi and Ali Noor were having an affair. How true is that? (Mandana turns beetroot, Noor smilies, Hamza get an ear-to-ear grin, and the other two hosts have confused looks on their faces) Host: Umm, we’ll ask your question .Bye ……………………………………………………………………………………… Needless to say, the question wasn’t asked but an uncomfortable feeling did hang in the air. The show ended soon after that and I decided to flip through the channels once more before hitting the sack. The glam-filled dramas were still running on star plus, the pushto movie was about to end on uni tv(or so it seemed), the porn channel was still on and yes, as usual, there was Noori on IM!
