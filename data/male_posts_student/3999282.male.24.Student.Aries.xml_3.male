She only treats me as a spare tire and I know it. Whenever I heard something from her my heart beats irregularrly. Come on, she likes Roch and she cheated on me. When can I wake up?   I am happy that I did some progress with my molecular biology reading. Let's keep the hard work and get ready for graduate student life^_^
