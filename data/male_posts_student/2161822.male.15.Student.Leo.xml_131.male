Which leads me to sitting here writing in my wonderful b-l-o-g. Summer is awesome. But I said that last entry. And I'll continue to type it since....well it is. I don't know what to say. Nothing really. I've been playing Avenged Sevenfold songs and System of a Down songs on my guitar. Sorta a pain when one band is in standard and the other is in a step down. I think. Right Side Of The Bed solo owns. Right. Bye. I can't think of anything to write anymore. Every entry is basically a bunch of random garbage that carries on the same topic everyday. Exciting stuff eh? That's what I thought. Keep reading punks. But I guess not since I have nothing else to say. So       bye?
