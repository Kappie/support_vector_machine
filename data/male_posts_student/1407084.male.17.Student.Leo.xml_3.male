"Oh, come on now," said the friend, "Surely you have met at least on girl that you wanted to marry."  "Yes, there was one girl .. once. I guess she was the one perfect girl .. the only perfect girl I really ever met. She was just the right everything .. I really mean that she was the perfect girl for me."  "Well, why didn't you marry her," asked the friend.  "She was looking for the perfect man," he said.
