I am recovering from a sickness that resricts me from any activities tonight (grumble). Planned to see all the chaps today. And I need to profusely apologize to those who read my blog for lack of postage lately, I have been engulfed in work and, frankly, can't get any poetic inspiration.  Tonight's meal was honey mustard chicken, mashed garlic potatoes, and french bread. My compliments to the cook. Wait, I was the cook! *Bwahahahahaha* Sorry.  Though I have not written of late, I did read a rather hysterical poem somewhere. I shall post it now:   EVIL! Yaaaaa Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha   Doesn't that soothe your soul? And so eloquent too!  I think I'll engage in a gay marriage as soon as possible to piss off the government as well as the multiple religious groups that say no to homosexuals because "homosexuals are all sinners" (fuck that). In fact, according to President Bush, "we are all sinners". (He says, damn the separation of church and state, and I say, damn him). Some organizations can sink sooo deep in their religious self-righteousness (*cough cough  ANAL-RETENTIVE *). Don't believe me?  urlLink Glories of a one sided mindset .  Cheers, mortals. And I am perfectly aware that this entire post is quite random. My apologies. That shows you what inhaling dijon mustard fumes can do to your brain, can it not?
