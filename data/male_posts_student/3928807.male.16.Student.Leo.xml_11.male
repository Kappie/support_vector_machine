I only got 4 hours of sleep, and I'm tired now. After I got home, I biked to Mcdonalds and handed in my application. I think the fact that I left the "past experience" section blank doesn't bode well for me. Last night, Darren asked me "what my opinion on shrooms was". I said "I don't know much about them". I think it's a bad idea to try them and I hope he doesn't- I did some research and found out that if you take a bad shroom, you can die of liver failure. I don't know how common that is though. In fact, I'm worried because I think he's the kind of person who can easily be led into harder drugs. In other news, I hate Sam more and more every day. I can't wait until I move out- or he moves out - preferably him, because I think I might like to stay at home during university- although I would seriously have to consider the pros and cons.  Max gets his day off in Toronto today. Darren wants to get high (surprise, surprise) and go see anchorman. I don't know if I even want to go out in public, because my hairdresser is a complete douche and has left me partly bald. Nah, i'm just exaggerating. But it's still frustrating- to think I gave him a two dollar tip. Anyways, hope it's a funner night tonight than last night, when I played super smash bros. with harrison and his friend.  By the way, why do all my friends have to have an additional friend they always hang out with, and whom I can't stand?   Anyways, I'm feeling okay today.
