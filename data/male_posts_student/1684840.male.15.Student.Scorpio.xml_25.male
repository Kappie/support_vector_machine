Woke up, went on computer, got dressed, had chocolate bar, more computer, had chese and onion bap, more computer, had more baps, more computer Mum and Sheldon came home, wrote in Journal...  And that brings me here :)  Might be getting a further $47 holiday money from my grandparents for doing great in my sats soon!  Very little time left now until my holiday!  T-Minus 3 days :D  Good Night... zZzZzZzZ
