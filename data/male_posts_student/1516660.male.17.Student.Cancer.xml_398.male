Blogger has colors and lotsa text-editing tools!  Look!      Wednesday    Right. What's interesting on Wednesday? Well..I've got oral. Sigh. It sucks la. I was given the topic about falling birth rates. This is so Social Studies! Thank god Debra lent me her notes to read at the last minutes. They have pretty good pointers. Oh yes. I got some topics, but my oral skills are sucky. It's like I keep stammering, forgetting how to express certain words in Chinese. Sigh. The examiers have to fill in for me! I die le la.  After that, me, Gloria and CQ waited for WQ. I made him promise to go shopping with me. Hmm. Me, Gloria and WQ went shopping. Gloria got fed a bowl of curry rice. HeHe! I can't find what I wanted, so I let Janet have the job of gift-buying. Quack!  Okie dokie. Yeah, I didn't get to type minutes on Wednesday. Gek Ling forgot to pass me the minutes, and I forgot to ask for them. Heh Heh. I think I was reading fanfic, if I am not wrong. Yeah. It got late, and I have no mood to blog. Heh Heh. There's always Thursday, right? Wrong! Lets' see why.   Thursday   Okay. We had QA today in Chem Practical. Ayioh! It's so messy and sucky! I got black X (A Zinc compound. I have no diea what the anion is) all over my shirt and face. Ayioh!!  Okay. What else happened? Oh yes! Choir! Ayioh...Choir hor. It was sucky. I have an off-day today! All my notes seemed to be wrong. I am having a terrible sore throat. Am, not was. Because I still have it now. Anyhoo, Mioss Ong announced that there were errors. Only 30 have to be selected to go. Sigh. She said she need almost all the boys. The operative wordhere is 'almost'. Sigh. I am not gonna be selected la. Ren ming ba. She said she wanted the best, not those mediocre ones. Besides, I was standing in front of her during warm-ups, and I kept giving lousy notes. I can't pitch for my life! Sigh. We'll see the results on Monday. I must come, fever or not. Yeah.  Oh yes! I nearly forgot. During assembly, we have personality analysis. Some company came to give us a talk, and booklet to fill up. I found out that I am a S-I. That means I am an Advisor-type. I am too lazy to give an intro of how an Advisor is like, but I can give you one famousexample and you can get a mini-idea. Anne, Sullivan, teacher of Helen Keller. Oh yes! Oprah Winfrey is an Advisor too!  Right, moving onto...   Friday   Friday ar. Ayiah. In GP, we did practically nothing. Seriously. That MCP was drivelling away and I couldn't care less. The front row was engaging in a conversation. The back rows were not. Me and CQ thus chatted the whole lesson. Even cats and ducks chatted about a lot of things!  Right. We went to interview the vice-prez of Parent-Teacher Network. Okay. We didn't really get her. We got another member of the PTN. She's super long-winded, and gives many irrelevant details. Sigh. I want to go off!!  From then on, it is a mad rush back home. Me and GL went off first. I was rushing and rushing and rushing like mad, in order not to be late.  I was late. Oh well. Me, Gloria and CQ are going to Mox Bar and Cafe to watch the Acapella Singing Competition. CQ's sister and her team (of Riverside choir, duhz) is taking part in this competition. We travelled to Tanjong Pagar and took a cab there.   Hmm. The bar is quite cool. I've seen lotsa groups come out to rehearse. They were good. I even brought fishball stick ($1.50!!) from the stall.   Okay. The secondary shcool category came first. Riverside's group was first. Ahh. They did a nice performance! :) Soon after came more groups. Not bad la. I don't see any group that I fancy.  The college category came next. Only two groups, and I was about to sleep then. I felt very guilty, because I was sitting in front, and I was quite obvious. HaHa.  On the open category, I woke up. Wow! There were a lot of professionals out there. My favorite got to be Upbeat. They rock man! I loved their style. So cool. Hip and urban! :)   Okay. The results are out. RSS did not win. Oh well. Upbeat did win the open category. That's well and good!   We travelled home. It was not a pleasant journey back. I got flu, and it is killing me. I kept sneezing and sneezing! Ayioh....I slept on the train, and the bus ride was killing me! I reched home, took a quick bath and fell asleep.   Today   Right. Today, we went bowling. Whee! It was fun, of some sorts. For the first round. I was giving a good performance. YaY! At the second round, I started declining. Oh well. We played for two rounds. Heh Heh.   After that, we went to the foodcourt to eat. I ate porridge la. What can I eat with this throat of mine? I need to recover my voice soon! I fell sick again. I slept after finishing my porridge, waiting for that WQ to finish his drink.   We walked around, and I felt very giddy. Sigh. Fever's taking its toll on me. Heh Heh. We went home after that.  Actually, me and Gloria went to Causeway Point to buy food for her family. I got to choose 3 bread for her family, because she has an emergency to take care of. I hope my choices are okay. Yeah. After that, we took the bus back.  Right. Today is a very signifant day! Actually, not today, technically speaking. Yes! This is extremely significant! Can't tell why though. :P  Yeah. Wendy has mentioned in her blog that I have a lot of things to hide, so my blog is not very open. Yeah. I kinda regret spreading word around about my blog's existance. It seems like almost everycat that I know is reading my blog. I can't spill my secrets out, and I badly want to! Sigh. Heh.   Ahh well. I gotta get going now. It's very very late. Gotta go now. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
