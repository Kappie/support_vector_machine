Star Trek is a little like family, it's heartbreak to see them go. I have to admit that "All Good Things..." is probably the most well done final episode of a series that I have ever seen. Compared to, for example, the final episode of Seinfeld, All good things is an utter success.   There's an army chap in the states that just changed his name to Optimus Prime. I'm green.  I got my Gameboy Advance SP - it's essentially a Gameboy Advance with a lit screen, in a 3 square inch fold up device. It's hell damn ass light, comes with a rechargable battery and it makes me feel good just holding it.  When the American's said Shock and Awe, they really meant it, didn't they?  Shortly I'm going to be absolutely drowning in Zelda. That's awesome.
