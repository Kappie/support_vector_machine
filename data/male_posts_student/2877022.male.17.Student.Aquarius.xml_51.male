So we can go there to  "sell"  collar pins and try out all the great food (we'll be mtg at esplanade so will be very near) .   Anyway, sigh . . .today was a bad day for me :( First, the stupid, dammanable seed crystal screwed itself up and became so blurry. But nvm other grps also the same so they are also all screwed  *evil grin*  .   Then, came back late for Mr lee's maths class and he knew i nvr do my work AGAIN. So 1st thing when i step in he ask me to go up to the board AGAIN. Then of course i did all wrong AGAIN and he had to correct me, resulting in some very awkward moments of him trying to be nice and me looking as  meek  and  studious  as possible. ( I think i grinned/cringed a bit too much, look perverty)  Later, went ar East to collect the printed underwear and got "violated " by the se lang ( fellow mean gal manda would know :)) AGAIN.   Lastly(and worst of all), got bad news from dearest canoeist mindy. And that was the last straw on MY back. Hence, total shit in school today + bad news= sad day  p.s. eh, who going for hc college dayt tml huh?
