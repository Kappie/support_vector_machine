She chose some song I had never heard of before.  Tonight, I'm sitting in Kiels living room, listening to some music on the sattelite. This song comes on, and I really was enjoying it.   Here it comes: It was the same song. Hey Ya by Outkast. It's a good song, and after downloading it and listening to it about 10 times, I've decided it's one of my favorites of the moment, which is odd, because it's not really my preferred genre of music. But hey.   By the way, Phaedra. Since you spent my money to download a ringtone, lets make it worth while. Call me once in a while, so that I can hear the ringer you chose, yo!
