There were alot of nice people there, Luke, Jamie, Carmen (obviously), Becca, Suzie, and then I met some more people there who were cool, a bunch of guys and girls I didn't know, but I did talk to a guy named Sam and a girl named Tory... won't go into detail there.  And today I had my music and theory lessons as normal, my clarinet teacher was very impressed by my Lutoslawski, cos it's a grade 7 piece, and I can play it, w0o - that's what "smart practice" can get ya, apparently 8) ...  After that when I got home, Charm, Jen, Kathleen and Charlotte came round, we didn't have any tea, oh well, but we did hang out at the back of my garden talking and such. That was cool, and I still have sunday, for which I have no plans. I don't think it's *too* late to organise something, just can't really be arsed, it is my day of rest. ye-arr *pirate noise*ye-arr
