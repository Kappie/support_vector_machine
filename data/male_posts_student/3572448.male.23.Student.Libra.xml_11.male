Instead i get to update my bookshelf.  that reminds me, scott (my brother for those of you not in the know) started putting down the pergo today.  He'd done most of the hard stuff by the time i came back home, but i still put in a few pieces.  The house is going to look badass by the time we replace the crappy carpet and linoleam (that doesn't look right) with pergo and tile.  Hooray for a successful brother!  And since i have an abundance of free time i've been running and playing some pick-up basketball fairly frequently.  I just wish my knees and feet wouldn't get sore afterwards.  But it feels good excercising again.  Now i just need to start playing raquetball again.  i probably should lift some weights, but i'll probably stick to pushups and curls...oh my legs are going to be sore tomorrow.
