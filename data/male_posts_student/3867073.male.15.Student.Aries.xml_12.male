I also tried to play a fourth round, but I was playing not so great, and the course made fivesomes, and it took over two and a half hours to play the front nine, so I quit after twelve and practiced on their putting green. Today I played eighteen, and shot a 84 at winnetka. There was a tournament so we had to start on the back nine. I had putted for about an hour, but I hadn't hit range balls at all, so I started double-double. However, I shot a 41 on the back, closing out with all pars, except on 17. Three par saves and no three putts gave a total of 15 putts, a figure which shows how good my putting was coming down the stretch. My chipping was horrendous, but making a few ten footers helped. The front nine started similarly, starting double-bogey, and there wasn't too much else of note on the side. Three pars, seventeen putts, a 43. Overall I wasn't driving the ball well at all, four fairways including a hundred yard duff on 11. I played 18 beautifully, and having the wind behind helped a lot. The tees were down, so from 410 I drove it to about 170, and with the wind behind and the pin very front, I took a seven iron into the green. This might be the only time I ever go driver-seven iron into eighteen. Plus I actually put it pin high and two putted for the easiest par I have ever had on that hole.
