It's another great resume builder experience.  When we were finished the "Fly Guy" - the man from whom we're renting the gear and who's teaching the flymen and actors how to do everything thing - asked me if I wanted to fly.  Of course I said yes, and I flew like Peter Pan, Wendy, John and Michael.  It was really cool and a lot of fun, I was basically the guinea pig for the guys learning the ropes before the actors came in.  I guess I'm more expendable than the actors are or something ;).  Anyway, I'm having a blast when I can... my part of putting up the shows is almost over (at least the tough part).  A lot of late nights are happening right now, but in the end, it'll be worth it.  Love to all!
