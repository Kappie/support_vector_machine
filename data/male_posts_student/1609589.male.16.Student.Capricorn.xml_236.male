Sign up for this life changing course which should be planned out far, FAR ahead but is being done at the last moment!"  So I'm sitting here like "whaaa?" and she makes me pick 3 of my teachers to put as references, and write about my pretty much day-to-day plan for what i'm going to do for the REST OF MY LIFE.  I'm still confused, and tomorrow I have to go in to bomb an interview in front of these IISM board people interviewing me for the course i know nothing about.  "So why do you want to do this course?"  "Uhm... cake?"  "Ah, so you've heard of our daily cake parties?"  "*phew*"  "What was that?"  "Uhh... Yes. Cake good."  "And what would you like to do as a job for the rest of your life?"  "Ugh... Erm... Egggggh!!!! ~head explodes~"  That's how I think that interview will go.  So, the Blue Man dallas fan group decided that we weren't gonna die, so we're desperately trying to think up shit to do. Noone has had any ideas so far. We have an artist/photographer and a theatre-savvy person, and we havent come up with an idea thus far. Wow. X-D We shall prevail!
