Diddy" Combs -- has  urlLink begun a get-out-the-vote campaign  entitled "Citizen Change". What's unique about the whole thing is the catch phrase being used: VOTE OR DIE.       The campaign claims to be non-partisan, but based on the involvement of James Carville (taking an advising role) and the aim at youths and minorities, Kerry can expect a bit of help from P. Diddy  Co.   As of yet, there is no word on whether Howard Dean will be enlisting hip-hop troupe Outkast for his  urlLink Democracy For America  organization. After all, urlLink that dude can dance .
