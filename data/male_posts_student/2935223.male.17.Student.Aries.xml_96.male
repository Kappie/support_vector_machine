Sorry Tashca.  Whoever sees her next....tell her I'm sorry.:-S  Sum people just aren't nice.  Sum people are.  Sum people are, and get hurt because of it.  Sum people aren't and get everything they could ever ask for.  This is a dear life lesson.  Sum people just are ____*insert verb here*  It doesn't even have to stop there.  It can be Sum people just ____*insert insert anything you feel like really.*  I don't know what else to type really....I'm just really happy.  Sumthing I haven't been for a millenia it seems.  I don't know even if it's happiness, as much as content.  Nope, that can't be it.   I'm plenty happy...but I'm pretty discontent..and I don't know why.  I think I know why...obviously because I'm missing sumthing in my life..what it is I have a good idea.  But, I'm still not quite sure...the empty void could be filled with any number of things.  Including Tomato Paste.  Alrighty, time for this happy camper to check out! PEACE!  Spense
