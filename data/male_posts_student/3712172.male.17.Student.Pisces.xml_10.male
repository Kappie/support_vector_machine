I am still half dead, but its all good. Helps me not to care about anything that much :).  I wonder if I will ever have the chance to go somewhere, where I won't have to worry about  ANYTHING.  It would be cool to have a feeling like that. Because everywhere I am theres something to worry about, or to dread. For example, I have to work today (LOL).  Tonight is a hopefully a coffee night. But I wouldn't be surprised if it got moved until tomorrow or something. I'll find a back up plan if that doesn't work. It's summer, plenty of time for coffee, friends, beer :) Mmmm. Beer.  This morning is kind of weird. Err, afternoon. I have nothing much to write about. Weird because I always got shit to vent about. But it's probably the fact that I am half asleep still. I am surprised I'm not typing jibberish.   I should go catch Days though, it's on at 1 PM, and it's now already 12:54 PM.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Later, I will post something worth it later :)
