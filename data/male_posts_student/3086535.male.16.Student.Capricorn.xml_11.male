If I combine the two things I just said, I'm a girl! *eeps!* What can I do? I think this is a way for me to release stress, or something like that. Really I just enjoy my thoughts for the world to see. Actually, no one will see this, I've given no one the URL. *cackles* Quite sly of me really. The real question is, how did you get here!? I give up, I don't care. You're here because you're here, nothing I can do about that. I was reading this book the other day, more like a short story really, called Twelve Angry Men. I didn't like it, is wasn't good in my opinion. What does my opinion matter, I'm not a book reviewer. I know, there is a word for them, but I'm drawing a blank. Anyway, do you know anything about 2nd century China? I'm very much into history, so I'll give you a little history lesson. (All of this I learned from a video game. It is true though, the game had an encyclopedia in the options) So, the Han dynasty, long the center of power in China, is falling apart from internal affairs. A sect known as the way of Peace arrises, threatening to throw down the imperal court. The Imperal Army answers the call to arms, such men as Cao Cao, Lui Bei, Sun Jian, and Yun Shao. These men succeed in throwing down the mystical leaders of the Yellow Turbans, (A nickname given to the way of peace warriors due to the yellow turbans they wore, duh). As they were doing this an evil man named Dong Zhuo took over the imperal court, influencing the young emperor easily. The army, under Yuan Shao, went to throw him down. At the battle of hao Lu gate, or some gate like that, they came across the man named Lu Bu. (a dorky name, yes) Who was the greatest warrior of that Era. None could defeat him, and in the end the army was forced to retreat. Lu Bu was an evil man and lived to fight. A woman convinced him that Dong Zhuo was ignoring him and Lu Bu killed him. Lu Bu then retreated to his castle with his men. Cao Cao held land in the northern part of the Great plains of china, having his own territory. Knowing Lu Bu would eventually be a problem he, along with Lui Bei, attacked Lu Bu's castle. They could not defeat his officers but eventually took the castle. You see, Lu Bu miss treated his men and they surrendered to Cao Cao, allowing him access to the castle. Lu Bu was executed, thus dies the greatest warrior of that Era. Lui Bei, along with his blood Brothers Guan Yu and Zheng Fei head back to their castle, but find they have been betrayed. Attacking Lui Bei's cousin at Cheng du, they take the land and set themselves up with land. In the mean time Sun Jian finds the imperial Seal in a well on the way home. He is attacked by pirates but succeeds in throwing them down. He is betrayed at Yu Jing but retakes his land. So the three kingdoms show themselves, Wu under Sun Jian, Wei under Cao Cao, and Shu under Lui Bei. Cao Cao moves to defeat Yuan Shao's much larger force and succeeds in doing so by taking an important supply depot. Guan Yu serves Cao Cao for some time before returning to Lui Bei. Each of the three Kingdoms fight various battles to become the supreme dynasty in China, but none ever succeed in doing so. Guan Yu is eventually captured by Sun Jian. Refusing to serve him Guan Yu is executed. Lui Bei and Zheng Fei vow to destroy Wu, but a few years later Lui Bei falls ill and dies shortly after. Lui Bei's strategist, Zhang lang (sp) is considered the smartest man of his time. He successfully helps Shu win many battles even against great odds. In the end his is extremely close to his vision of supreme victory, but falls ill and dies. Cao Cao also falls ill and dies, leaving his son in charge. Sima Yi, Cao Cao's strategist, moves into the background, trying to hide himself from the limelight. Eventually Shu and Wu's forces fall weak due to internal affairs. Sima Yi comes forward and challenges Cao Cao's grandson to a duel, the winner taking over the imperial Mandate. Sima Yi wins, and so falls the Wei dynasty. Sima Yi dies, passing his legacy to his son, Sima Yan. His son forces both the weak Shu and Wu empires to surrender thier land, Shu first, then Wu. So all three Dynasties fall, allowing Sima Yan's Jin Dynasty to become the supreme power in China. In later years it becomes known as the Romance of the three kingdoms. A whole bunch of other stuff is mentioned, how various characters from the game died and such, but I only mentioned the fall of the three kingdoms and their commanders. Quite sad really, none of them saw their kingdom come into absolute power. Not that you wanted to know any of that at all, but I felt the urge to tell someone, it is so interesting to me. I can't say how true all that is, I think I misspelled names and a little of it my be backwards, I haven't got all the history down yet and I'm going from memory, so don't quote me. That's all, my wrists hurt even more now.
