Once again i am feeling down because of one thing....women.  I don't understand, i thought libras were SUPPOSE to be all good at stuff, like, romantic wise...and i know i can be romantic, but i have no one to show man....i fucking hate this shit, sometimes, i juss wish i can get up on a stage, with all crowd of all the girls i'm intrested in, and juss tell em', one by one, "i'm really intrested in you, would you like to go to the movies or something?" i dunno, anything along those lines, jUSS PLEASE, i don;t want to be single anymore, i mean it's great, dont get me wrong, it's just that i can't take it anymore, everywhere i look, theres someone making out, theres someone holding hands...i mean the least most likely person is getting fucking PUSSY! (don't get me wrong, i dun wanna get into a relationship juss for the beaver...but i do belive it's important in a relationship...)It's so depressing knowing that like, all your buds (minus a few, sorry man) are succsesful.  And to top it of, all the girls i DO like, are A) To old, B)taken, C)Out of my league and D)all of the above. i hate it, i don;t know why, it's like a curse.  And don't even TRY to say it's worse for some people, you have NO idea.  Jorge is my main example.  People put him down man, and even though i do it too, i still feel sorry for him, BUT he acutally gets around, meets people, mingles.  Sure i'll do that, but i DON'T want to.  My whole philosophy is: If she likes you, she'll come to you, then, if i like her, i'll go on from there. Like, she starts, i finish. I know your probably saying "thats the reason why your having such bad luck",but i mean, i like it that way.  That way, you don't have to worry about rejection, and i KNOW everyone hates to be rejected, it's horrible, i haven't tried to get with enough girls to have that happen to me, but i'm sure i never want to.  And ya, i'm sure there are girls who like me, and want to be with me, but i need a sign.  I bet the whole entire population of girls at that school could be inlove with me, and i'd be the very last to know.  I need a damn sign! i need another   urlLink Libra! (they have great sex together, and Yes, i'm a libra, born sept. 28, 1987) i need a  urlLink Leo! , SOMEthing compatible! (ya, i belive in zodiac stuff) I need anything! I wanna write down poem after poem on how i feel, but it's not getting anywhere....But ya, i have gotten close to many people, and i guess thats also maybe part of the problem, theres this girl, (also a libra) that i've known since last year, awsome person...BUT, at the time she was going out with someone for a LONG time...so i kept my distance...i'm pretty sure i got some feedback from her, but i defeinitly didn;t wanna ruin what they had....fast foward to now, she's single (to my knowledge) and i'm not doing a single damn thing about it....i dun know, maybe i should walk around and tell everyone that i drive a mercedes benz, and have a 7 inch cock, maybe that'll do it..... i mean EVERYWHERE i see, people are together, doing everything, EVERYONE is doing great. shit, i'm sorry, but this shit is unbelivable.  If your a chick, and live in this area, call me, or IM me, or e-mail, do something, i'm ready for everything, i'm good to go, juss show me, and i'll take it from there...well, enough problems...tomarrow i'm staynig after school, Helping rob out with "OHS Mole", so i'll prolly stay after for a bit, after that is a week of vacation.  were heading over to dans house for a week long LAN party, in which rob is going to bring his copy of  urlLink Karaoke Revolution , which by the way is a great game, played it for the first time at robs, definity fun, but ya, thats pretty much it.  If i dun do anything, i'm going to head down to NYSC, get rid of some stress, the stress i'm definilty going to have after KNOWING i have no valentine..:o(, and if i do have one, i already have an idea of who it is..and i won;t be suprised, but it it is who i think it is, i'll prolly take advantage of that, and try to hook up with her, but ONLY if i get one...ya, well, thats about it, i'll prolly type something tomarrow, or maybe another one today...we'll see
