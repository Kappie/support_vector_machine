We were guessing on a contact point and it looks like we guessed right. It's raining pretty moderately and the winds are getting up there. The hotel location is prime, the network is up, the landlines are sturdy and there's a pretty damn good lunch spread downstairs.  We're all in good spirits, after all we love this stuff.  Hopefully once Scott starts snapping photos and I start sending them to the office systems, I'll share some with you.
