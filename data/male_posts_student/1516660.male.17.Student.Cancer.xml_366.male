For Paper 1, I did the conversation thingy. Ha! It's about Da Sao not wanting anymore kids due to stress. I had fun writing about the topic. I somehow made my essay funny. Heh. Even CQ commented, "How come all your essays got add some funny bits one?". Ayioh. I figured that if the examiner don't laugh when reading essays, most likely I would get a lousy mark. Might as well make them laugh right? Actually, that's not true. I am not a boot-licker. I just want to be funny. Heh.   Okay. Paper Two's quite ayioh... The first section about filling in the words...Sigh. I only know one word, 'fu' in 'chong dao fu zhe'. Heh Heh. At least it is better than nothing. The rest I found was relatively easy. The comprehension, thankfully, was not a killer. I can actually coherently answer the questions! Usually I would blunder through the passage. Ain't that something? The summary was a killer. I wrote rubbish. Heh. 20 marks ma. Might as well write something.   Okay. After MT's done and over with, we (me, Janet, WQ, CQ and Gloria) went to McDonalds. Somehow, I got an upsized McNuggets EVM for just $4.75! The others were so shocked! I was too. Oh well. I da shen te shen wor! After that, Janet went home and the rest of us went to the library to study Maths.  Stupid ole me forgot to bring the writing pad. I have to go all the way to Popular to buy a pad. Then I helped WQ photocopy some notes, then I went back.   Heh. Am I productive today? Nah-ah. I only did one chapter. ONE chapter on APGP. Heh. Sigh. I die le la, tomorrow. Hann came. I gave him the tape I helped him record. Hmmm. I even helped him buy a Cashcard to photocopy notes from CQ. Oh my meow.   We ended at 4.50+. Oh well. That's all the studying we can take, I guess. Me and Gloria met Esther on the 913 bus. Heh Heh. We chatted and chatted. Oh! Looks like she's in NYJC choir too. Which means our conductor is the same. Heh Heh!   Coming home, I came online. Blah blah. MNI's still not done yet! More than a week of maintenance! BAH! I can't stand it anymore! Meow moo meow moo!!  I recently got this Shareware Image Editor, GIMP. Well, TNP said it works as well as Adobe. Actually not. You can't import backgrounds, can't change the fonts and their colors. Ergh. Is it so hard to make a decent banner?!! Sigh!   Okay. Oh my! I realized that this is the first of many Monday entries that ended before Friends started. YaY! What a wonder!  Oh yes. I just heard this Fact of the Day from Jamie's Say It With Music. It turns out that the state of Michigan in USA has more varieties of trees than the continent of Europe. O.O Interesting! You really learn something new everyday from Say It With Music! Now I sound like Jamie Yeo plugging her own show. Heh Heh.   Okay. I gotta get going. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
