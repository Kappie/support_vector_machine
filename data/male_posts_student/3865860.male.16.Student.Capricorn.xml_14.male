Took my dog out on a really long walk everywhere down the canal and stuff he kept annoying me cuz he kept walkin back across the road when cars were coming. oo yay im going for a balti in town in 1 hour mmmm spicy food cant wait. AT the gig last night there were loads of birmingham uni students and it made me think about how life never stops and how when you think of it the cliche is right, life is short and you should make the most of it. Its just hard to see that sometimes. Also i've been thinking most people are out to screw you out of anything or fuck your feelings up so you may as well never let your guard down to anyone. Its happened far too many times to me so i only ever let my guard down around people i really trust, not to do that to me. Anyway its Friday night and im gunna try and enjoy myself so this is it for 2day.  Tom
