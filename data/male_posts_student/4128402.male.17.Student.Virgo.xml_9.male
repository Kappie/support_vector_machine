The site  urlLink www.bigbetty.tk  was supposed to jst be a bunch of ppl talking utter pish about nothing in particular in an attempt to have a bit of a laugh, it has since turned into downey and darren abusing celtic and rangers respectively. This will not do, whats the point? There is now a 'im not contributing until its neutral' debate so i say why not make it neutral and have NO football on it to save all the shite.   Right, now thats over with, on with the pish for which this site was intended... Downey suggested that i get my own page so i can talk about music but i dont fancy it really, anything iv got to say about anything i'll put on here, including music, which i will do now.  Last nite i got my computer to finally do something productive and download a full live concert by the Libertines (find this at  urlLink www.babyshambles.com/pissed  ).  The concert is amazing and the band are incredible, if you have not heard this band do so now, you'll either love it or hate it but if you are part of the former group it will change your life.  If I was to get a tattoo (which ssems quite tempting these days) i'd get the word 'Libertine' on my arm, much the same as the one Carl from said group has emblazoned on his bicep.  The Libertines mean freedom, love, an escape from the mundane lives we lead and tell you its alright to be whatever you want so long as ur happy, and whats wrong with that??? However theres trouble aboard the good ship Albion, as singer Pete Doherty has become a drug riddled fool and has been told not to contact the rest of the band till hes kicked his habit, which it seems he is unable to do.  So the Libertines may not exist for much longer, which is a right bitch cause they are genius.  The Libertines have a fan base unlike any other because they actually make an effort to get close with them, they play gigs in fans living rooms and invite fans back to theirs for a bit of a singsong and a few giggles. Can you see Kylie doing that? Craig David having a knees up with his fan? It wouldnt happen which is why Libertines fans are solid and want Pete to get better so he can join his friends and do a gig in my house!!! The band once played a gig in a pub for free because a fan asked them too, and then Pete asked if he could stay in the place coz he didnt have a hotel for that night. AMAZING! Anyway, heed these words, the Libertines are the future (if they stay together that long), ive seen it. Download some tracks (notably What A Waster, Time For Heroes, Up the Bracket, Tell the King, or anything else it doesnt matter Dont Look Back Into the Sun is another) The new self titled album is released August 30th and their debut is out now, get it, you shall not be disappointed, and you'll never be the same again!
