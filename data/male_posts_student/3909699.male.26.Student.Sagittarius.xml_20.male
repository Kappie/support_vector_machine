Johnâs house is decorated on the theme of Christian kitsch: glow-in-the-dark virgins,  Life of Brian  poster, golden icons, pictures of comical scenes from ecclesiastical life. The best piece is pictured here, tinily, he has came from  urlLink Viz , which does parodies of the kind of tat that advertisers in the  urlLink Radio Times  hawk to old ladies: itâs a collectorâs edition plate, entitled âThe Life of Christ in Catsâ, depicting pertinent scenes from the messiahâs life with cartoon cats instead of peopleâat the top is an image of a cat being crucified, with the legend 'IDRIS' on the top of the crucifix. On the other hand, John has an overweening obsession with IKEA. He talks about it a lot. He even goes on about how good the food is at IKEA. Itâs taken me a while to notice the Nordic furniture beneath the clutter. Most of Johnâs kitchenware, for example, is IKEA; also his bookshelves and, I noticed yesterday, every piece of lighting in the house too. Then there is his computer, a brand new monstrous black desktop from  urlLink DELL . I cringe to remember that it wasnât long ago that I nearly bought a laptop from DELL myself. DELLâs computers are so ugly. I mean, itâs kind of nice that all Johnâs electronics share a consistent style theme, but all the black is so oppressive. Black plastic, with flashes of silver plastic and green LEDsâgrody. And he runs Windows! 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink christcat 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink XmarkX .
