           
      Well all, I'm off on a vacation of sorts. I'm leaving tomorrow morning for a night in Denver; a night in Vernal, Utah; a few days in Salt Lake City; then back to Vernal for a night; and Denver for a couple days. When I get the chance I'll blog all about it or I'll call when possible. Be good without me everyone!
