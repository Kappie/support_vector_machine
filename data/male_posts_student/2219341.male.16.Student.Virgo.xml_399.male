((they wont though cuz thats against the rules! hehehe!))  oh yes.. i spent all last night takin pics with Mike Baker's camera for the slideshow tonight... and i had my camera too for takin my own pics.  so it looked pretty funny.. me walkin around with 2 digitals around my neck.  i need to get some new batteries for tonight.  the ones in mine right now are runnin low.  i'm feelin better bout everything as of now.  well cept those stupid miniscule things that i mentioned yesterday.  but as far as friendships go... much better i think.  the girl... ?  well someone told me to "get over" her.  sigh.  that really got me thinkin.  i dunno.  ugh.  it almost complicates things.  cuz now i have to decide whether to follow my feelings or my mind.  yanno i think thats one of the biggest problems people face.  following their emotions or their logic.  more emotional people follow their emotions and more logical, realistic people follow their minds.  but both types sometimes must choose to follow what they are not used to following.  i know i'm one of those emotional people.  really i'm too emotional.  and i try to incorporate my logic into my decisions.  i want to balance.  i think thats what all people really want... to balance the logic and emotions of life.  i need more time to think about my decision.
