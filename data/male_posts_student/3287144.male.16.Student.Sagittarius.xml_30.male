My life seems to be coming together!  But for a moment I would like to talk about my room; it went all rather smoothly until I had washed all the brushes and then came to packing away the dust sheets which had some wet white paint on from the previous day and my assistant managed to get several white streaks of this on to my fine wall - so back went the dust sheets, had to re-wash the brush... But it is worth it, even if it does look like an Indian restaurant.
