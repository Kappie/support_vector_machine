I dunno about the style. Very odd.  I have recently seen two movies that I very adamantly suggest that everyone see. One is  Donnie Darko , which is so neurotic and freaky and fucked-up that it is frightening. Really. I mean frightening, it has a demented bunny rabbit guy in it named Frank who looks like he was hit with a truck on the face, and it deals a whole lot with time travel, which confuses me to the extreme. The second movie is  G.I. Jane , which is a righteous babe-type film concerning the first woman in the Navy Seals. It has actress Demi Moore, who shaves her head for the military and bulks up with some huge quantity of muscle. I have a new favorite actress.  Met up with Elise, went to the library, and listened for about thirty minutes to an elderly man chew on his dentures. So we left there and walked in Shelby Farms, then proceeded toward a television to watch  Donnie  and set off to Japanese food. Quite fun, I daresay.  Cheers, humans.
