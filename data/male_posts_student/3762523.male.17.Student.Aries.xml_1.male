It's the area of the web where every person can make their own opinion heard (though it's typically ignored or overlooked anyways) for others to agree with or mock.  The blog represents a shift in time where the individual is heard more than the whole, but where the power of the whole is often preached.  It's arguably the most important and influential creation on the internet since the internet itself.  Even more than time-consuming websites, the blog gives us all our own voice among the world.  It can be more powerful than books, or weaker than silence.  So, if you even care about this blog at all, you're probably wondering why I started this one; why I bothered to spend my time sharing thoughts with all of you.  Well, I've already answered it: I want to share my thoughts with all of you.  Feel free to dismiss them, ignore them, refute them, berate them, or even (and I doubt this) agree with them.  This particular blog was started mostly for political purposes, to suit my own opinions in matters.  I'll be the first to tell you that most everyone who reads this will  not  agree with what I say.  I'm an anarchist, a strong believer in extreme freedoms in every aspect of life, and a supporter in ignoring the whole, and examining the self.  To lead us into this journey of self-praises and self-importance I offer you this quote, by the master of words Ralph Waldo Emerson: "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesman and philosophers and divines.  With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do."
