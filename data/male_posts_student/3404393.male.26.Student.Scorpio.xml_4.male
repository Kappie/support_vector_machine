This black lady was waiting at the counter looking very  impatient. Within a minute she called one of the employees over and verbally  barraged them with demands on where the heck her food was. About 30 seconds  after that she got her food, but looked very disgruntled. She flung open the  bag, inspected the contents and then went on a tirade.  "I can't believe this! I have been waiting for FIVE  minutes to get my food. FIVE minutes! And then you bring me this crap? I don't want this, gimme my money back  Whoah. Five minutes for food. Five. As in less time  than it takes most of us to fill up our cars with gas.
