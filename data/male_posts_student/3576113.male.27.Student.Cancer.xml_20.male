Fabulous film and time will only tell how it stacks up against my all-time top 5.(Braveheart, Almost Famous, Good Will Hunting, Monty Pythons the Search for the Holy Grail, and Fear and Loathing in Los Vegas) Was thinking fondly back to my one trip around the field in my old dune buggy, before it was bedtime and adults trashed it. I was still the coolest kid on the block, cause it was mine and we'd like sit in it. Roll bars and everything, painted in a nice bright yellow which I very much approved. I should like to have one again, even if it just sits in the back yard. Is a comforting thought.
