Well if that is the case, today was a good day indeed. Started on a note of esteem self control [withheld from public display] and then went out with me spending a substantial time on my Strat Man project. The assignment was to prepare an industry note. All i was doing was going through several industry analysis and trying to figure out the same .... well in other words i was cutting and pasting. But somehow in the middle i realized that i know more now than what i knew during my summers (which were incidently in the same industry as the one i am working for: Telecom). Well how so ever incremental, i got to know more about things and the industry. Its not exactly fraud. Yes people are right, there is a lot of fraud around, and if you are reading this nakul i buy your argument about this. but then i still see the zeal in you to make a difference here and honestly speaking people need to keep upto their levels of zeal at all places ......   regarding knowing someone more, i had a long chat with manjari, and the best part is that i think i know her more now. no it is nothing drastic, but now i understand several of her actions over the 4 years we have been together .... i truly like the female and what she does to me when i am with her in whatever way !  I got to know myself more, and i am improvising   A good day indeed ....  anf for all those who dont know me, i am a very very very optimistic person. and ambitious too .... the next thing to do is to start writing a poem .... havent written one for quite sometime.  And if u are reading this, come back, revisit ... you shall see my writing skills come back to normal and imrprove also ... i am more determined now   Thanks Manjari
