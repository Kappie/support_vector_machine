Put bluntly and kinda mean ;)  The whole point of this is to pretty much discuss how badly I am going to fail the upcoming chemistry test...but oh well. Im over it. Only about 20 more days of school left. That equals out to ALMOST a month  Not too shabby whe you think of it.  P.S. If anyone else wants to come out...just call here first... I think we are starting at about 7:00-7:30...Russ said he might bring some pizza...and if he doesn't...I have frozen pizza :)
