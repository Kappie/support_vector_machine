I was getting stuff for Bon, so I can't elaborate any further in case she reads. I really wish she didn't have to go. *sigh*. Anyway. After shopping, I doodled a little bit. Well, I call it doodling. Some would call it drawing, but that's irrelevant. Our school books came in today, total bummer there. I guess we're probably starting next week. I'm going ice skating with Bonny tomorrow. Dave and Julie may come. But yeah. I've never ice skated before. I'm looking forward to it. man, David's going to be 16 tomorrow. My little brother is growing up... haha. yeah. that's perty much it fer right now.
