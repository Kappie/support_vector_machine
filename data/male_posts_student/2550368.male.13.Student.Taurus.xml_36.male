I just ordered Jeffsworld.BIZ and it should be online soon. I think im going to use it for the Main Network site kida think..ya know? I also backordered jeffsworld.com.. you know what that means? Once jeffsworld.com is avalible for buying (like the second is avalible) it will be registred under my name and then we will rule!  HERES WHAT MAKES ME MAD: Jeffsworld.Com expired in nov. BUT evrey time I tryed to register it I was told that it was unavalible. Most whois servers said that the domain had no entry. Some whois servers showed the old news that it expired NOV 2003. Just six days ago (Jan 21) Jeffsworld.Com was registred to some lamer who buys lots of domains and puts a search page up. THAT MAKES ME MAD! UHG!!  Heres a little bit of other jeffsworlds: Jeffsworld.Org - Now this site hasn't been updated in a while (2000) but at least his name is jeff! Jeffsworld.US - Looks like someone's a n00b and didn't put up a site!  Oh PS: I made the  urlLink Jeffsworld Network Status Blog , its got news about the site/network/servers.
