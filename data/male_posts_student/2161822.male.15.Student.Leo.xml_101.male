Cept he has about 1/100th of his skill while I have 1/99th of his skill. I really like this mouse pad gel thing that keeps my wrist nice and relaxed. Ash:  have to tell me when you're going to church. Call my cell or something. Ryan sucks on guitar. Bad. Shut up Ryan. Now. Thank You.  Listen to H.I.M.
