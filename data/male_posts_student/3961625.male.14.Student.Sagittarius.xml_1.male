I stayed around Vurste. Read a little, played a little, ate a little, watched a movie, read a little, and slept very little. That having been said, lets get on to today... whoops! yesterday.." everything I said about the day before yesterday, except add on leaving at 7:30 (we were meant to go at 7 but various children kept on injuring themselves) for Gent, which is currently in the middle of a festival. Jeez... I think only "Taste of Chicago" beats that crowd.       It was beautiful.
