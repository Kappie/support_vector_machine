I mean seriously; look at the evidence: Chicago--too windy Miami--too hot Minneopolis--too cold Seattle--rains too much Pheonix--doesn't rain enough Washington DC--built in a freakin' swamp! Denver--built on a freakin' mountain! San Fransisco--built on a freakin' fault line! Not only that, but what's the deal with some of these names? I mean...Scaggsville...really...I sincerely appologize to all those Scaggsvillians out there that have to write it on their envelopes every day...sucks for you...
