Hmm...yesterday i stayed in school till 6 plus...waited for hui cos she had cheerleading...almost got locked in class! i taught her a maths too, at first i didnt know how to do at all...den i learnt all that in 5 mins lol...den i the end today a maths test i knew how to do haha...ouch i cant type properly now...my fingers hurt...the bloody guitar...been training to play for her lol...cos i saw what one of her close friends wrote...eh "guys who dont play guitar are not much of a guy" or something likedat...but it meaning's the same...so better play guitar. Actually when i was younger, if i had a choice, i would choose to learn the guitar instead of drums...but too bad..took up drumming le...nvm still got time to play lil bit of guitar jah...just hanged down from talking to her...a little sleepy now. Theres a physics test tml...sian. Hmm...what else can i comment on? O ya, i didnt write what happened today ah. Okay, like every other schooling thursday, it sucked. 4 periods of science crammed up. Sheesh. Damn stressful. But i skipped clb! yay!! cos i had "heats" haha. Erm...den i went to the library...we were making a little bit of noise, ok maybe quite loud la...in the click centre cos all of us were laughing and sort. Then the female librarians, who were same rank as us, Eline and Yun Yann go and like, cannot use bad word so...er...not happy with us. ah...Den dunno say what if we dont stop she will throw chair over...den like threaten us and eden, even though me and ryan were the same rank with her and eden was of a higher rank. Eh but dunno why eden was scared. Just because of a little bit of noise den they not happy and scold somemore, den give those type of face...see already really wanna slap lor. Den i was like, sitting at the far end at the com lab, com no.3, the one that i always use...i was like trying out the guitar notes on the internet, try my fingering, i never even strum, never even pluck, no noise. I just move my fingers nia...den Eline told Yun Ying to tell me say that if i dont stop playing it she will throw my guitar. I was like what the hell? im not even making any noise lor. Shit i was damn angry, but i didnt say anything but put my guitar down. I feel damn disrespected lor, they younger den us, somemore rank same as me, still say these sort of things, they dont even give me face...tsk, some girls really damn slappable. In the end the Eline cry, i was like, cry la, we wont even bother, you want us to pity u? PUI! lol. Sheesh. Luckily i learnt how to control my temper, or else i go straight up to her and shout le. You look at her face got those type of proud proud look. Cos her sister was a library head before, den she think she has foundation she got power. Tsk. I don't understand why people like them have to make the library so "not-fun" and boring. Eden and Jonathan oso. I mean like, if you are so strict even when theres no teacher around, who would want to come to the library? For me, every friday i just let my juniors shelf all the books, den finish le they can chit chat, but must walk around and chit chat...lol..cannot stand in one corner. Then the person in charge of the click centre just have to make sure that no one is turning on the volume too loud...if hes playing game or anything just let him play, dun care. I mean, this is what the library is about, what are the computers in the click centre for? Just school work? Or friendster? If that is so, it will be a waste, i dont understand why they dont allow them to play games. If you expect people to give u face, u must also spare a thought for them what, if they are enjoying themselves although they broke the rules but they are not harming or disturbing anyone, why not man? I may seem selfish here, but if u think about it, it will at least make a little sense.
