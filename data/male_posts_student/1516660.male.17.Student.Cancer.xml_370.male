Today morning we all went out. The first place we went to AMK Market! Guess what we ate? Did you guess correctly? It's popiah! Oh no! What have I typed? It's ku meen!! Yes! Mushrooms noodles! What a nice ku meen!! I love ku meen!! Ku meen is very nice!! Yummy!!  After that we went to NTUC Fairprice. They brought lotsa things, including waffles!! YAY! Even waffles are nice to eat!  After that we went to some POSB Branch in Yishun to make my ATM card! YaY! I finally made an ATM card! HaHa! The teller made me do a survey on her customer service and I ticked excellent for all (except for "Time", which i ticked Good). She's really good ma. She's very friendly with me. Smiled and talked a lot. Yay! The pin is a 6-numbered code that goes: ******. Yes! That's how it shows on the screen, doesn't it? You get what you see. Even my ATM Card is so blue and shiny!  Yes. After that we went to Causeway Point to buy my present. HaHa! My present was the Yang Guang Xi Lie 7 and American Idol 3 Greatest Soul Soundtrack. YAY! HAHA! My mother also brought the Charmed soundtrack, but I have to pay her back. Sigh. YAY! I got 3 CDS. I just listened to Yan Guang xi Lie! Not bad, not bad at all! I like the songs! Good job, KY!  Right. We went to look at the Singnet 1500 plan. Well, it's isn't much better than our current one lor. Sigh. I ended up signing up for Anti-Spam and Virus Scanning features. Ayioh...thhat counter lady somehow assumed that I wanted Web Filtering as well. I DID NOT say that! Oh my god! I corrected her, and my mother confirmed my choices in a loud and clear voice. Even so, I don't trust her. I never trusted admin people anyway. Ever since Cheng Shan Primary admin made a blotcher and omitted out "Kelvin" from the register, causing me much emotional and psychology scars in secondary school. Ayioh!! What if there's a filtering service? I shudder to think what the protective Singaporean government blockheads will filter out! God forbid! I may not even read slash anymore! Or go to Wiccan websites! Those close-minded idiots! I hate the government. I am so gonna complain if there's a filtering service added in my bill!   Okay. What happened next? Ahh yes. We went to eat lunch at Woodlands Central. Hmm. Even sheng mian is nice. Also longan with grass jelly. Even the longan season is coming! Weeee!   After that, I came back la. Sigh. Despite my resolve to study, the craving for the fanfic overpowered my freewill and thinking, and thus, I went online to read that nice fanfic!   Heh. Went for dinner at 6. Me and Siva smsed each other. I was actually playing with medieval words. Heh. I missed her. Ayioh!! Siva mah friend!   Meow. Right. I just have to ruin my fun and tell Gloria I was planning a surprise. Well, it ain't really a surprise. I just wanted something to zheng CQ. Heh. I am getting more and more 'disgusting' everyday. Might be the influence of Dray (friend of author of Something More) and Mike (character in Welcome to the Real World). Heh. Anyhoo, I got my idea from Huan Zhu Ge Ge. Heh.  Ahh well. Right. What else? Nothing more right? Then I gotta get going! See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
