I refuse to believe that Hasselhoff is better than the hundreds of other men who auditioned for that role. Well, at least he's probably better than Richard Gere.      In other news, Mom and Mom's Husband fought incessantly through the night and early morning. Unfortunately for me, there was  urlLink no hallway door  to drown out their persistent shouting.      Ugh,  urlLink Zara 's [ urlLink blog ] just   urlLink asking   to be raped. If you've learned anything from me, Zara, it's that you shouldn't trust spics and black people. Now kick that Ruben guy to the curb if you know what's good for you!         -chuck-   ...or eat limes...
