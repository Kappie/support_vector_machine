NO.. and i wont give a damn to tt lor..   gg to do work again.. have to get lots of things done before the end of the week.. esp the cca stuff.. HCPA is not something tt is as slack as what i used to have in MTech, CHS..  i think this will be the longest entry i've ever written.. i feel kinda relieved after voicing out everything in the blog.. i hope tt i can get well again when i wake up tmr.. seeya and gd nite~
