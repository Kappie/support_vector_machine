Not only did we get down most of our hot song "Hell's Kitchen," we invented a mind-melting segway into our even hotter song "Hottest Girl In School."  We're [this] close to getting the kinks out of "Doug Bukkake's Frisco Freakout Bar  Grill."  Kitchen . . . Hot . . . Bar  Grill . . . it's a theme, people.  Note Joe's Krispy Kreme shirt.  Can you smell what the rock is cooking?   urlLink
