It wasn't the problem, we were. I'm sure I could be a good DM, and we've already got 7 adventures plus a nice cache on the Net also.   I'ma miss that parade anyways, so it's not really pertinent that it be good. I'm working 12-7.   Went to St. Cloud today. Jedi Academy for Xbox was bought. It looks decent. That's mostly all I've to say.  Haven't seen any of Wimbledon. I'm going to tomorrow, though. Also there's a dubs tourney in Elk River on Monday that'll have to face the awesome powers of Hobe, also me and Jefe.   Songlist edits, v2.0  Tribute - Tenacious D Walking in Memphis - Billy Joel  Elton John Miss Robinson - Simon and Garfunkel Along Comes Mary - The Association  I'm about done.
