YEAH!!!  its so good its one of the best movies i have seen in about... a big while :P  I had to lie to the ticket dude to let e in, and i accidentally said i was 16 and i was born in 1984.  but if i WAS 16, i would have been born in 1986.Oo and im 14, december 28 1988  WEL LTHE MOVIE KICKS ASS  the movie is about (dont read if you do care for spoilers) a disease that enrages... things (hhumans, animals, bla) and everyone gets it, but only a few number of people dont catch it. Well i liked every single second of the movie i liked, because its really that tense. in one of those parts when there is supposed to be lke a big suspense, i grabbed my dad's arm violently and he jumped very high XD XD XD  that was the highlight of my day, 28 days.  but some of the parts in the movie were pretty obvious,  [spoiler]      like the part in which they have to decide between going underground or the safe fields Oo. or the fact that all europe gets infected but no one helps them Oo. or the fact that infected people dont fight each other Oo. the activists on the beggining of the story were pretty stupid too, like: oh theyre infected, and the disease is intravenous, but releasing them and getting a bite shouldnt be too dangerous. DUH!  oh and my dad also bought a wireless keyboard for the ipaq. its model is 3090 or something like that. Its good, and it has a mirror because the guy who designed the ipaq was stupid enough to put the IR thingy on top of the ipaq Oo.  im talking to sarah about 28 days and she says she was talking about it like 20 mins ago with her sister :D im tired and my headache is about to start.  today, by not having spikes at the movies, i noticed the difference between EVERYONE staring at you like if you had done some very sinful thing, and having like two persons just look at you and then look at something else.  im thinking about buying a shrits that i saw that said: "keep staring, i might do a trick" while having my spiked hair. itd be good for a laugh. :P ok so im uploading this and ill see wat ill do for the rest of the day (sleep, perhaps?)   cya!
