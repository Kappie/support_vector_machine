And if you hadn't noticed, the music and the counter I think are pretty swish, although they have been there for a while. I also added the about me, although come to think of it I don't know why, because only people I know have the URL to the site...meh.  A strange thing happened to me in English today.... I actually laughed. (Shock, horror!) And it wasn't just a small giggle, I was in hysterics for about 10 minutes, which DickyBod will back up. It started with my english teacher getting a bit angry - 'Look, boys, why do you do this to me yeh? We reeeealy haven't got time for this. Please just try and engage with this. Ok, focus, let's go.' He then get's a bit more wound up... 'Look, Harry, stop that, please? I beg you just stop doing that, we have to get this done'. It then goes a bit further...'*mutters under his breath* Argh, for f***s sake boys, why do you do this to me?' Anyway, whilst this is going on, me and dickybod are discussing the Simpsons, especially the 'Uncle Moe' episode. The funniest part? '*A buzzer sounds to indicate someone orders the million-dolar birthday fries, Moe gets twitchy, a small girl*:.... Unkie Moe....? What... is... it.... sweetheart...? My sodie is too cold and my teef hurt. Argh, your teeth hurt, well that's too freakin' bad, ya here?' Now, as my english teacher is getting more and more wound up, just the slightest hint of an '...Unkie Moe...?' from dickybod is enough to set me off laughing. I probably haven't laughed as much since seeing the MTV Matrix spoof for the first time. Now THAT was funny:  *Architect talks to Neo* 'You haven't answered my question' 'Yes I did, you see, what I...' 'You haven't answered my...' 'I'm trying! You just need to let me talk' 'Why am I here?' 'Urgh, would you just SHUT UP?' 'You wont let it...' 'NO YOU WONT LET IT! I'M THE ONE WHO TALKS! OK MOUTH SHUT, EARS OPEN' 'You haven't answered my....' 'YOU DO  NOT  WANT TO SEE ME GET OUT OF THIS CHAIR! Ergo open your yapper one more time and I'm gonna architect a world of pain, all over your candy ass. ERGO! VIS A VIS' 'This is about...' 'CONCORDANTLY'  Aaaaanyway. What else happened to me today? Nothing really. Oh well, ta ta for now.
