(yes i'm exaggerating a little... but not that much). so... if you have lots of cash to burn... and want a summer home... buy one here... you can spend your entire summer @ duffs and the anchor bar... and eat all the wings you've ever wanted. i promise you... you'll like the summers here.  next  urlLink installment  of star wars. it's gonna suck just like the phantom menace sucked... just like the clone wars sucked... but you'll see it... cause you'll feel obligated to... cause it's star wars... then you'll think about how you were stupid for wasting money on it... cause it's gonna suck... and you already knew it was gonna be bad. george lucas totally crapped the bed with the prequels.  that is all... have a good night.
