Float On is the title of a fairly kickass song by Modest Mouse (have to give them credit) and it happens to make a crapload of sense to me. Read the following serenade from their popular tune:  "I backed my car into a copcar the other day, well he just drove off sometimes life's ok. I ran my mouth off a bit too much, a what did I say? But you just laughed it off - it was all ok. And we'll float on ok, we'll float on ok, and we'll float on ok and we'll all float on anyway...."  Alright. In synopse, one thing: FREAKING GOOD MESSAGE. It just makes sense. Everything's gonna be ok, no matter what happens. Things will turn out. You don't need to freak out. I try to apply this to me as much as I can. This song has the ability to get me up and happy. Its just what I need sometimes. Float on bitches.... :P
