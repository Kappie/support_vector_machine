We "broke up" on Sunday and so this week has been a roller coaster ride emotionally.  I knew it needed to happen but I wasn't planning on doing it right away.  I wanted to wait until she was out of school and done with track etc.  So when we talked on the phone for awhile and then I asked her what she wanted to talk about.  She said that she felt that she didn't know me and didn't really know what she felt.  So I kinda figured that she wanted to change something.  So she was the one who said it but it was quite relieving.  I had told God that if anyone was going to end it, it was going to have to be Lisa.  Well God listened and took care of it.  Afterwards I thought I was okay.  I cried a little then I got online and talked to her there for a bit.  That night was really hard.  I cried for about 3 hours and then I finally fell asleep.  Monday was tough, cause all I could do was think about how I felt.  I felt relieved and really sad at the same time.  For the past couple of months Lisa was all I could think about and everything I did was for her.  I knew I shouldn't be focusing on her so much or even at all.  So I had decided that I would take care of things but when was the question.  It could have hurt a whole lot more than it did, God was really looking out for me.  So Tuesday I went to Albany with Kevin.  We rode down and I ate like crazy.  We hung out for awhile during the rally.  I saw Josh and Caleb Stauter, Greg and Aidan Cleghorn, and Josh Siddall.  Caleb as usual was flirting with the girls, Josh as usual was debating with Greg and Aidan.  Greg had dislocated his arm earlier that week.  So he gets the klutz of the year award so far.  He broke someone's nose and gave himself a concussion at the same time in one of our earlier soccer games.  He was going for a header.  It was beautiful.  Then we had to go and hand out fliers.  So many good Mexican jokes since Kevin had to give one to Assemblyman Jose Rivera.  On the ride back I told Kevin what went on Sunday and he was kinda shocked.  Then I went to Steph's meet and saw Kyle there and hung out for a bit.  I was good and didn't just spill how I really felt.  So I came home afterwards.  By now I was doing better but at night and in the shower it still wasn't fun.  Wednesday I had two tests.  Spanish and Fundamentals of Computer Science, both at 10:30.  I woke up that morning and kinda forgot that I had to do 10 pages in my Spanish workbook that was due then.  So I flew to school and sat in my car doing the exercises.  Then I got out and realized that the tests were at 10:30.  I had been thinking they were at 10 so I had gotten there way too early.  So I relaxed and focused on the tests.  I had been doing my devos regularly and so I was thinking about Hosea.  It is so nice to know that even when I willingly walk away from what I should be doing, I'm still forgiven and welcomed back with arms open wide.  I went in and took my spanish test.  Then he didn't have my workbook graded yet so I ran over to the other side of the campus and took my Fundamentals of Computing final.  I had it finished in under 10 minutes.  I walked into the class late and there were 4 people in there.  When I left there were still 4 people in there.  I ran back over to Academic and grabbed my notebook.  Then I ran back across campus to my car and went home.  I hung out at home the rest of the day.  By now I am getting used to the idea of how my relationship with Lisa is gonna work.  Thursday was pretty boring.  I mowed Brownick's lawn in the morning then I was thinking about going to Phoenix to see those who were there... A.K.A Lisa.  But Kyle wasn't free so, and I didn't really know how I was going to handle myself.  I went to Wegmans to harass him.  I was good tho.  So I went with my mom to pick the van up from the garage.  Then I did pretty much nothing.  While I am thinking... I talked to Lisa on Wednesday and I made an idiot of myself.  I opened my mouth and inserted my foot as far as it could go.  Oh well she is still talking to me.  I couldn't have made that much of an idiot out of myself.  Friday was okay.  I crammed for my math test in the morning.  I either aced it or flunked it.  I cleaned my room and my bathroom and the whole basement.  Kyle and Kevin came and spent the night.  That was interesting.  Kevin told me how he thought Jen wanted to breakup with him.  Then Kyle showed up late as usual.  Then he found out about Lisa and I.  So Kyle and Kevin had a blast with that.  It was great to laugh but it got kinda old after about 3 hours of it.  We ate and watched Batman.  The original movie.  It was pretty corny, which made it even funnier.  It's amazing how logical they are.  Then there was today.  Earlier this morning we were goofing off.  Ethan got to play ping-pong with Kyle.  Even tho I had to move him and help him hit the ball he had a blast.  The smile and the hug and the thanks I got from him was awesome.  Then he went upstairs and bragged to my parents about how he beat Kyle.  I love my bro so much.  Then we went to the "carwash."  We decided not to do it after all so we went back to the church after eating at TacoBell.  We played soccer for about an hour and a half.  It was so much fun.  Of course I could do without all the blisters and the sprained ankle but hey it was worth it.  I loved playing against Lisa.  Her competitiveness is one of the things that I liked about her right from the start.  She was throwing her body around and bumping and thumping just as much as me.  Then she started getting cheap.  Grabbing me and trying to take me out.  I had fun teasing her about it.  I also got to talk to her a lot more than I have before at a YG.  She noticed it too.  So all in all it was a good YG.  Well now that I know what my week has been like, let's talk about what I think about it all.  The things that I've been thinking about a lot lately are Lisa... DUH, school, and where my life is going.  Let's start with the easier of the three.  I really have no idea what I am going to do with my life.  I want to be doing something useful and fun.  I told my mom that I had thought about enlisting in the military just to jump out of planes and run around.  I really don't want a deskjob.  I want to be doing something active.  So I am really questioning if I should be in computer science at all.  Then since I am questioning what I want to do with my life that kinda asks where I want to go to school.  I am going to get as much finished with my CS degree as possible but then IDK.  RIT might not be a possibility since the stupid GED requirements are out there.  So I might have to go out of state.  The other possibility is Word Of Life.  Hang out for a year.  Then decide what I want to do with my life.  Who knows, I know I don't.  Well I guess that leaves me with Lisa doesn't it.  Well I don't really know how I feel.  So let's start with the things I know for sure.  I love her as a sister.  I think she is an awesome friend that I am not willing to lose.  After that I really don't know.  I loved being able to talk to her today relatively pain free.  I guess this is what I want in the long run, but I don't know.  I am trying to tell myself everything will be okay.  But I can't see it and it is really annoying me.  I really hate a lot of the things that are running through my head.  I know I am going to have a hard time when she dates someone else.  I would like to think she won't but then I'd just be stupid.  I really don't like emotions sometimes.  I want to be a close friend but I don't know if I can do that easily, especially if she is dating someone else.  Something that has been bugging me is when she would say she loves me or whatever, is when did that change.  Like I know she would say it to Joe, and then tell me how she didn't mean it.  It has really made me rethink a lot of what I know about her.  The whole waiting forever for me deal etc.  I guess I am having a little trust issue.  When I told her I agreed that we needed to change things I think she took that as I didn't like her anymore.  If I didn't like her anymore then it would have been so easy to end it but it wasn't easy.  I don't know what I am going to do.  I really hate this sometimes, why couldn't I just disappear.  I want to be a good friend but it is going to be hard for me when she finds someone else she likes.  Oh well I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.  I need to go to bed and get some sleep before I start getting too depressed.  Maybe I'll finish the deck of cards tonight.  The one good thing about being stressed and having a hard time is that I get so much stronger.  I mean I've done over 400 pushups in 5 days.  My chest has visibly gotten larger and so have my arms.  It is kinda cool.  I'm gonna need to get a bigger bra soon.  I really hope I can stop thinking about all this because it is really cutting into my sleeping time.  I'm so tired but whenever I go to bed I can't fall asleep before 2AM.  Then I always wake up around 6AM and just lay there.  However today at YG was the first YG in a long time that I've been able to just relax and be me (or at least something much closer to resembling the real me.)
