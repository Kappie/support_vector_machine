My friends, I am not the only one who advocates this philosophy. Many others have found, and now utilize, its power to heal. Consult your friends, spread the word, take hold of the simplistic power to recover from hurts only you yourself can mend. Find it in yourself. I shall part by saying this proverb in the ancient Greek tongue, "Ekeis kalan haymeran". Which, in simple terms for the laymen, it holds the meaning: "have a good day".
