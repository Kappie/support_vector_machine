As you know im a skilled professional at examining things no human has ever seen before so i thought I would do some research on Santa Clause. Remember the stories and the pictures of Santa at the north pole with his little elf helpers? Well you can forget all of it. Santa is actually a serial killer that is so old he has a white beard and is known as "The Red Bandit" because he always wears red. He also doesnt have elf friends all of those helpers are members of the Ku Klux Klan. He also doesnt live at the north pole but rather in the storage room of Home Depot. All of the presents you receive on Christmas are spy devices with microphones and cameras on them and all of you are being wat5ched right now by something you got for Christmas. While I was researching the undercover spying mission K.A.L.C.(Kill All Little Children)i got shot 17 times and now i rap like 50 Cent and really suck but if you ever hear the dreaded "ho ho ho" run and get a rocket launcher and cap that mutha F@#!$r.
