Today I spent some time with the group that went to Easter Camp. We spent a bit of time talking about what happened over the camp, and how our weeks have been since we got back. It was great to talk to these young guys and girls, and listen to them talking about the way God is working in their lives. Its really encouraging. I've been sort of sidelined in the Youth Ministry at my church recently, as I have come to grips with some of the things that have been going on on my life, and I am now getting the opportunity to slowly get back into it. I'm really glad that I haven't lost my enthusiasm for youth work, its an area I've always loved to be in involved with.  Also today, after our more serious discussion, we went for a soccer game in the Auckland Domain. I hadn't realised how unfit I was!! I knew I wasn't in the best shape, but man.....! What happened to the guy who could run a seven minute mile only as few years ago? (and that guy had more hair too!) I actually managed to touch the ball a few times, and almost scored a goal, so I had fun, but it shows that I have to get myself back into shape. At least now I'm not smoking anymore, so that's a start!
