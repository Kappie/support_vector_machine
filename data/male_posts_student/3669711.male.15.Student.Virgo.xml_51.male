We did all sorts of activities today, from a updated more fun version of tag to playing with frisbees and bowling.  For the middler group we always start with, we started by playing a game called Poison.  The object of the game is to push the person you are holding on to into the "poison", therefore getting them out.  That went well, and we all had a good time.  Next we played with the tag game, where you would have a partner, and you and the partner would latch arms and keep your spare arm open in sort of a hook.  Then there would be a chaser and chasee in the middle, and the chasee would have to latch on to one of the other groups, and the person on the oposite side would detach, and then give chase to the former chaser.  Great fun.  Then we played around with the frisbees and it was time for them to go.  Rain: not yet.   Then we had the pre-teens, and basicly did the same thing, only they played frisbee baseball as well, and i also played along with all of the games that they did.   Then snack time came... it was there that i recieved my $125 cheque... the money that i had worked all week for!  Pure bliss on my part!   Then came the smaller groups. Since it was pouring outside, we did all of our games inside.  We played bowling, musical chairs, and with balloons for both smaller groups.  And at the end of the day, each kid in those groups got to take home a balloon.  ^_^ they had lots of fun with that.   Well, then came my "driving lesson".  I did perfect today ^_^, we did the same course as yesterday, and i performed superbly.  I should have my G2 by now... lol, jokes.   In other news, i have just finished downloading all the  urlLink Dragon Mango  comics (best downloaded using IE, if you want to know which comics are more than one jpg.), and have updated my stash of  urlLink Machall  and  urlLink Megatokyo .  ^_^  Thats quite a few comics to keep up with.  Thank goodness that they don't update every day, or i would be one busy man!   Have a good weekend all!  Lates
