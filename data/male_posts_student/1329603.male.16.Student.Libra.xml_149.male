Now isn't one of those times for me.  I'm tired, I feel ill, and I'm not keen on myself.  And I can't meet up with Laura tomorrow but that's more a different topic, it's not directly involved in me feeling awful.  Quote of the day: "When they've tortured and scared you For 20 odd years. And then, they expect you to pick a career, When you can't really function, you're so full of fear."  From John Lennon's   Working Class Hero   Love, Jon Roskilly
