No, I'm not talking about Tom Green on DVD or even porn.  I'm talking about the  Sean Show *.  Yeah, I have some great ideas cooking in my little head and they need to be filmed, but this is where I run into a problem.  I do not own a video camera, and people who do are incredible tight asses!  Yes, you guessed it, I, Sean Berwick, the one and only abuser of commas, am asking  YOU , yes  YOU  for help.  Please lend me your video camera every once in a while or...   Send any donations to the Sean Needs a Goddamn Video Camera fund! 1084 Queen Street West - Unit 32b Mississauga, Ontario, Canada L5H 4K4 (People who know me can always donate personally)   Not only will you get a sweet ass hug (or the female variant known as an ass grab), but people who donate will receive  a FREE secret prize !**  SWEET!  Oh, and I am also currently accepting souls if you have an extra you could spare.   * Show name subject to change. ** You only get a prize if A) I feel like it. B) You're liked by me (see the COPS post).
