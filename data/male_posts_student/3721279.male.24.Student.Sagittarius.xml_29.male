Okay, basically that introductory sentence was meant to symbolize my need to go clothing shopping. My 18-year-old, incredibly hip, yet slightly loud protege (add an appropriate apostrophe) Don has offered to take me clothes shopping, an adventure that I imagine would only help to further promote the whole "Dave is Gay" myth. Still, I could use some new threads, but I should probably wait until my forthcoming enormous paycheck arrives from our lady Gamestop. And while we're on appearances.....  It's time for the haircut. I know, I know, don't cry. To all...(counting hands)...2 and 5/8 of you who enjoyed the comeback of the longer, "I look 16 again" hair style, well, I thank you for your kindness. But I must ask that you brace yourselves for the return of the spiky, for its coming is long overdue, apparently.  I worked nearly 40 hours last week at Gamestop. I know, no one wants to hear me bitch. And I can hear about half of you rolling your eyes (isn't that weird?), saying, "Awww, Dave had to work a full work week, boo hoo!"  But you know what folks? I'm not going to bitch about the hours. I must say, however, that I'm truly beginning to loathe this subculture of customers that I serve every week. Some days I thank the Gods that my parents forced me to go outside and  socialize  with other human beings and get involved in activities, because damn, had I sat inside all day and all night, doing nothing but playing video games until my eyes dried out, I shudder to think how similar I might be to some of the creatures who come into my store  nearly every day  and throw their money away. Okay, I'm done being mean and bitter.  My financial aid came. Yippee. Ooh! Ooh!  And guess what?! I  finally  got into that stupid class that I needed to get into! Ah, my academics are starting to fall back into place. Now, if only I would get some word from this bereavement counseling job thingy. Everything might just be peachy between me and MU again.  This Thursday, I will be masquerading as Jesus Christ. So if anyone catches sight of the risen savior in southeast Pennsylvania, I'm sorry.....it's just me.  I think that's all I've got for now. I need to go and gather up my hot roommates, so that lunch might be consumed in a pleasant social manner. Until next time, keep your socks off and your eyes open, and don't take candy from any strange penguins. Tell them I said to come home and stop bothering people.
