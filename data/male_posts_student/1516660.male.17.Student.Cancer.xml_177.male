Yesterday, I, along with the other music students, went out for enjoyment. HaHa! Actually, I was very apprehensive on going, but due to Ben's and XC's invitation, I went lor. Ayiah....last day to relax le ma. Who went ar? Me, Mel, XC, Ben, EeChuang, JiaHui and HuiMin. Yeah.  First, we met at Woodlands MRT Station at 12.  Me and Ben went there and met XC, then we went to Burger King to eat la. I drank Pepsi there lor. After that, we met the rest at Woodlands MRT. Then, we proceeded towards Mel's house.  EC and Mel are gonna practise there, then Ben is gonna depart to Mr Low's house for practicals. After that, we are going to bowl. Okay...Mel has a lot of birds!! He even got a peahen (who kept squawking all day long). Oh oh! Let's not forget the fishes! He got so many fishes...3 luohans and so many more. HaHa! One of the luohan and another white fish were fighting. At first hor, we thought they were kissing (lip to lip ma)...then we realized that the luohan is biting the lip of the white fish. HaHaHa!! The two fishes keep fighting each other. After watching fishes and hearing performances, it's time for lunch! They brought two cans of chicken soup and we heated it....woah! Quite nice leh!   After eating, we decided to play daidee. HaHa! That Benjamin got 'cursed' by Mel! He lost the game and I entered. I didn't win la. I got so good cards you know! I can't bear to use them!! But nobody wants to use 5-cards combinations!! Or else, I can easily win the meow meow game! After watching a few games, Ben and HuiMin left for Mr Low's house. We played another game. It's a kinda-divination game, where it tells you in what placing are you in in your lover's hearts. Only the girls and Mel played. Me and XC just watched. HaHa!!! After that, we played Cheat. I ended up taking one big pile of cards, just because I dunnoe how to cheat. HaHa!! But I got almost every card in my hands. A-ha! They can't cheat so easily. EC got out firist, leaving me, Mel and XC. We were like neever ending, keep pushing cards towards one another. After 15 minutes of that, we decided to give up le. Then, Mel and EC practised one more time, and Mel went to bath. I tell you ar! I dunne what happened you know! My nose suddenly bled! Oh meow meow!! Did I mention my nose bled on Thursday too? Ergh! What's wrong with me?  We went out of Mel's house to meet with HM and Ben in Marsiling MRT. We went to buy bubble tea when waiting for the two late-comers (who were watching WanXin's video in Mr Low's house. HaHa! XC they all said it was a striptease and mentioned something about LB). We met with Ben and HM n Marsiling later on, and took the train to CCK station. Woah! While waiting for the train, my nose bled again! I tried to control the blood from running out......Ha! We took the train to CCK, then took the LRT to Bukit Panjang. My frist time riding the LRT leh. So cool. They even fogged up the windows when the LRT came near HDB blocks (to protect the privacy of the residents la). Coolies!  We alighted at BP station and walked towards the shopping complex. On the way, we discussed XC's 9 concubines and a porcupine. Even the bigot cat practises bigamy!! Meow!! When we arrived at the bowling centre, guess what? It was full! They wrote my name down on the waiting list, then we went down to eat at KFC. Due to the lack of cash, I only ate fries there (to conserve money for games). Ben even called his god-brother to come sponsor him money. Woah!! We discussed so many issues there. Like Charmed. Mel and I are Charmed fans! Meow meow!!   We went up again, but then, the bowling alley is booked for tounament. Sigh!! No bowling today! Ben's godbrother arrived and gave him $50. Woah!! The whole gang made him pay for a NeoPrint. We then left BP Complex and went to Causeway Point to take NeoPrints. On the bus leh, everybody discussed American Idol. About Simon Conwell, Kelly Clarkson and so many cats!   Oh yeah! We took Neoprints there. The first pic was sponsored by Benjamin. Woah!! Meow meow!! We decided to take another pic. This time, we made the girls wear costume. HuiMin wore a kimono, EC a sailor's costume and JiaHui a Santa outfit. Me-ow meow! We took pics again! Meow!! Before returning home, we went down to Basement 1 to drink bubble tea. I drank Honeydew Milk Tea. After that, me and Ben took 913 back home.  I watched Survivor! There was actually talk of voting Rupert out (Drake lost agian! Sigh sigh Sigh!). Oh my god! This cnanot be. The who ar, Trish and Jon wanted to vote for Rupert. Luckily, Sandra and Chista, being loyal to Rupert, told him about the secret plan. He then went on to planned to vote Trish out. At the Tribal Council, it was quite touching. Rupert felt betrayed by his own tribe (the idiot half of it). When Sandra described who's she gonna vote, I thought it was Jon! And this time, they showed us everybody's votes. Woah!! But they didn't show Shawn's. He the deciding vote between voting Trish out or creating a tie between Rupert and Trish. Woah! In the end, Trish got voted out! Meow meow!! Plot against Rupert some more la! And the bastard Jon better watch out! Who I think should be Sole Survivor? Either Rupert or Andrew Savage. Yeperino! :)  AlrighT! I gotta go eat lunch. See ya tonight, blog! Byes!!
