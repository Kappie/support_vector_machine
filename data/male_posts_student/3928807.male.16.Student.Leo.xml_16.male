I talked to Mike Mcglennan on MSN a few minutes ago.. turns out that while they were at the cottage, Darren's mom caught Darren stoned TWICE. Jesus christ. The first time, they were both watching a movie with their parents and then Mike bit a can or something and said something about a triangle can and they laughed their asses off for 10 minutes. Then something happened that let her find out the next night. He's probably grounded for eternity or something. I bet he won't be able to come over to my house for the rest of the summer. You know how much that would suck ass?  There's practically nobody else to hang out with. Mike Leethwood and Harrison call me every night to ask me if i want to come over. Fuck off, you annoying terds. Cary is cool, and he came over a few days ago, but it seems harder to get together with him and do something. Plus, Darren is my smoking pal. I can't remember if I put this in another blog post, but I smoked alone  a few days ago before I went to Harrison's house to play risk. It's definatly not as fun alone, but that could also be due to the fact that harrison is a complete bore. Damn, I wish A.J and Taylor would invite me in their nightly little adventures.  Shiri is here now and Maya is visiting in September. I know Maya smokes pot and I really want to muster up the courage to tell her I smoke and I want to smoke with her. Maya is one of the coolest people I know, and she is the first sibling I would share my pot with. I need a new filter for my pipe. I tried using that silver crap (cant remember what its called), and i ended up choking on ash or something. On the weekend i'm going to go downtown and buy some magic cards, and maybe a filter at the Friendly Stranger (because i'm pretty sure i won't be seeing Darren on the weekend since he is probably grounded). This blows, because now I have nothing to look forward to on the weekend. I guess it's kind of pathetic that I look forward to the weekend because there is a chance of hanging out with darren, but he is pretty much my only close friend besides Cary. I never talk to Jeff outside of school for some reason. It's been a long time since I hung out with Anton or even Andrew zirone. Even Ryan Stobnicky was fun to hang out with. This is all to blame on moving to Blue Forest. Darren at least has Shane, Joey, Andrew Jack, and Mike (to an extent). I could hang out with Harrison and Mike more, but I'd just be lying to myself - they are not fun and they are not really my friends.  I guess I'm okay with the friends I have. It's better than Sam with his one asian friend. Whenever I need to feel better about myself, I just compare myself to Sam now. It is quite uplifting. I wish Sheldon lived closer to my house. He's cool, and I wish he could come over to my house sometime this summer. Maybe even smoke a bowl. Shit, I am becomming obsessed with weed. It's almost like a lifestyle. Which reminds me, I may have lost my hackey sack. That makes me sad. I am also in the process of losing all the muscles I built during grade 11 fitness. That also makes me sad.  I'm still wondering just how much trouble Darren is in
