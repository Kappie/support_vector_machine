Ive had a weird craving for peanuts.  I think i might be pegnant.  That would suck.  I mean, did u ever see that episode of enterprise when tucker got pregnant cuz he touched that wierd blue stuff? and I dont even have a girls freind.  watch out for typos by the way.  Im offering a small bounty for them.    All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
