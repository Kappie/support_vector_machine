I ignore it at first.  But it comes back again.  I know my roomate isn't in, so I decide to investigate.  As I walk into his room, I find a squirrle face first into a bag of Tositos that the little bugger managed to rip open.  I wouldn't say I was scared of the li'l bastard, it was just a monetary recognition of, "That's not supposed to be in here."  He scampered away through the whole in my roomie's screen (presumably made by the squirrel) with a moderately squirrle-sized chip in mouth.  I closed the window and he ran away into the tree.  He came back less than a min. later, looking for more chips and shot me a dirty squirrle stare for closing the window (if such things as dirty squirrle stares exist)
