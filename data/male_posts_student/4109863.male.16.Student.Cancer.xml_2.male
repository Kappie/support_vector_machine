I lived in a big farm house, running free on over 50 acres of corn fields and farm land. We had lots of animals including dogs, horses, and rabbits. When I was five years old, my family moved to Akron, where I've lived ever since. So, most of my memories are from the city. For those of you who haven't been to Akron, it's a middle sized city of about 300,000 people. I like it here, it's a nice place and fairly comminity oriented. I have two brothers and two sisters that lived with me and my parents. My oldest brother was seventeen when I was born, so the age gap showed itself with him and my other siblings. Now, the oldest ones are gone, living in other states and places about America and soon beyond. When we moved from the country, my parents were against pets in the house, so we didn't have any. But now we have a black lab, Othello, and a grey tabby cat, Jackson. A lot of years have passed from those days in the farm house. There I began homschooling, for which I continued until 9th grade, where I went to a private, christian school in Cuyahoga Falls. This coming school year I'll be a sophmore. Allot has changed, allot had moved on, but I hope I can hold on to those farmyard years so long ago.
