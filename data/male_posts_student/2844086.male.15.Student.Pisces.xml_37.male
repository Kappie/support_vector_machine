The real reason is because I haven't practice but twice in the last 2 weeks. I know it's terrible, but I've really been busy. I need to find time though. I really don't have time enough to do all that I need to do in a day!!      Anyway today I finally practiced! It felt really good too. So here it is:    Scales  - All were shocking-ly well. I mean I didn't falter on any of them. I was happy. :)    Cadenses  - It was really scary, but all of these were really good, too!    Hanon  - Really gave me a work out.   You miss a lot when you don't practice!      Technic  - Now I did have a little trouble on my inversions the first time, mainly because I looked. Yeah I know Ms. Rhonda. Anyway after that I played them very well. "Snowmobiling" was ok. it wasn't great but it wasn't terrible, I just need to work it back up.    Piano  - Ok here is the very rich part of my practice! On "Reville", I faltered not once! I KNOW!!! AHH! I was happy. I played it perfect. I didn't have to look at my left hand, when I moved it. Whew that just makes me happy.      And that's all I practiced. Now I have to work on Master's Class homework, which is to write music to the story Ms. Rhonda gave us. I really have a hard time at this stuff.      So hopefully I'm back to inspiring you to practice! Hey don't roll your eyes! :) Just kidding.
