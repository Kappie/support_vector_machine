Fortunately, no one had any plans (probably due to the lack of a social life...at least in my case).  Well Emi couldn't go anywhere because of family game night so we had a guy's night which I suggest we do regularly.  I had fun and I think they did.  Stu and I went over to Jenna's.  I drove by her house once cuz I didn't want to be first and then came back because his station wagon was there.  So I go in and he isn't there!  It is his brother.  Apparently they don't communicate and did not realize they were going to the same place at the same time...  Well anyways I was the first to arrive so Jenna, the torg and I played pool.  It was a good thing no one was watching.  Then Stu showed up and we walked to Dunkin Donuts.  Then we walked back.  (We got food while we were there.)  Then we went on to Jenna's roof and Stu gave an astronomy lesson.  Very informative.  Then we played pool.  I don't remember who won or if anyone won.  I think we may have stopped or something.  Then we played go fish.  Good times.  Then stu left and we took some personality quizes.  Then I left and got home late.  Like breaking the law late.  After midnight late.  Mum didn't care I was late which was cool 'cause usually every second counts after I am late.  Then this morning she wakes me up at some ungodly hour and asks if I am going on the bike hike.  I am like I was out past midnight, I have a wicked hangover and YOU WANT TO KNOW IF I AM GOING ON THE BIKE HIKE!!!  I think she realized that was a no.  Then my car broke today.  So sad.  It is really broked.  It is at the garage or something.  Meanwhile I am being nagged to buy a car but I am waiting till I find the right car.  Oh wait I did...and they said no you dont need a new car the one you have runs fine.  *scowls*
