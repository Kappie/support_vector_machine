Typos on the chat page have been fixed    4.  Obsolete contact information in the imac guide is fixed    5.  The frames version has a toolbar    6.  The Links page is updated    7.  I have added to the FAQ page    8.  The site now is viewable is resolutions of 800x600+ On a sadder note, the following pages have been removed:    1.  The screen resolution page has been deleted    2.  The E3 info in the basement has been deleted    3.  The old interface is nowhere to be seen (maybe a good thing) On yet another note, about that list of my favorite games... I just bought Golden Sun:  The Lost Age, and I think a may have a new number 5.  Also, I realize that Rayman 2 is not a Nintedno-exclusive game, so please don't email me about that.  Also, I just downloaded GameTracker.  It's a program for Mac OS X that lets you keep track of your videogame collection.  I don't have much use for it, but I like the rating feature.  If you lend videogames to friends a lot, it might be useful.  Also, if you use  urlLink Gamefly , it might help you keep track of what make you already rented.  If you would like to download this program, visit its website  urlLink here .  Lastly, if you remember, a while back I posted an entry about Wiretap for Mac OS X.  I forgot to mention that you can also use it to record music from save-disabled music composition demos.  You should still buy the product, because doing this is a pretty tedious process, but if you just want one song, and you don't mind using AIFF format, you might want to try it.  Check out the new interface of my website, and have a great day.  Bye!
