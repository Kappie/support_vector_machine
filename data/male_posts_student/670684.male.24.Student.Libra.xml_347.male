I'm registering the script as well...picked up Final Draft 6, and registration through that is "quick and easy!"    I'm downright giddy about catching Errol Morris'  urlLink The Fog of War  on Friday at the Dobie.  I missed it at the Palm Springs Film Festival, passing on it to see a terrible Turkish film called  urlLink Distant  (IMDB published my review...not my best writing, but it's there), and regretted it from the moment.  Now, almost two months later, I hit sweet paydirt!    No times listed yet, and Dobie says it's not showing it, but on the  urlLink official site  (which is fucking awesome), it says Dobie  Arbor.  Everyone's welcome...should be a big group of folks.  Hopefully more show to this than hit the Velveeta Room on Thursday.  Regarding Velveeta...I think a fairly substantial number of screenwriters are going to do a three minute set sometime before the end of the semester.  I scoped the place on Thursday, and was pretty impressed with some of the comics.  I did notice that the crowd wasn't too big into intellectual humor, so if I want to be a riot for my three minutes, I need to figure out a routine that is all about assholes.    Blog's suffering...Foshko's getting good writing out of me, but it's up to me to make sure that my spirit isn't broken.  Whereas grabass is usually a game I revel in, I feel unequivocally guilty about wasting time right now, considering I'm in danger of falling substantially behind on my thesis work.  Of course, if I can write a freakin treatment in three days, I can probably catch up on pages pretty quick-like.    Haircut tomorrow, and maybe a trip to the Circle C pool.  And drums.  I was going to hit Dallas on Friday for FOG OF WAR if it wasn't playing in Austin...that's devotion.  Oh yeah, and an outline on a screenplay.  And better blog entries.  And coffee.  Helping Brian with his resume.  Reading TV scripts from the students.  And for some reason, I'm craving a stairmaster right now.    The Seinfeld on right now is the one where George makes the pudding skin singles and tries to eat Pastrami during sex.  Glorious.
