The way she smirks, the way she opens her eyes as if it's the first time she's seen you, every time... I'm in love.  I'm also in love with  urlLink Adam West . He's in some damn commercial advertising 'EZ Link" terminals, which are like little internet kiosks that buisness owners can buy and use to make more money. He starts to describe all the features, like e-mail, web browsing, instant messaging, and then gets really serious and says, "I never had half those gadgets in  my  batcave." He says it with such contempt, as if buying an "EZ Pass" kiosk is a personal insult to him. Well I'm sorry Mr. West, but I DEMAND that my clients have access to an affordable internet kiosk! I DEMAND.  I've got a hot idea for a visual heartsmacker. It'll be animated, using models and the school's animation equipment. It'll star a red toy tank with glued on lobster claws, and will feature Cupid, who's arrows can NOT penetrate the armor. I repeat, they can not penetrate. I sure hope I have time to start this before the year ends, I've also got to finish my other animation about sharks. The tank will also be yelling "Sorry Ladytron! Sorry Ladytron!"  At this very moment I'm watching the 1953 classic 'The War of the Worlds. It really makes me want to be a filmmaker. The best part so far has been the general of the military fighting the alien warships, calls all his troops "..Communist babies..." for abandoning their posts. Then he and a priest are incinerated by the Martian heat rays. What a great movie. And of course, the awesome scientist who eventually saves the day, decides to hang around with the dumbest bitch he can find. I hate her. Where have all the smart ladies gone?   Scientist: If the A-Bomb fails, my calculations show that they will conquer the entire earth in six days. Stupid Bitch: The same time it took to create it, how ironic.  You see what I mean? I'm so glad the bomb fails. It's sort of neat, to see how much this movie inspired later sci-fi flicks, and is still present today. Even Signs borrowed so much from it. Speaking of that, M. Night Shyamalan's next movie, 'The Village', (The story of the village of Covington, Pennsylvania in 1897 and the horrifying legend of "mythical creatures" that live in the woods beyond the village.) looks great. I haven't seen any trailers except the one telling me that he directed it. He has such a talent for terror I can't wait.  I won't be able to enjoy it without my tank-top girl though. "Attention please, four minutes to bomb time."
