Time really files fast. Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in the past.  On that note, after last week, my mind is starting to finally open up to new possibilities and outlooks. But somehow I'm left feeling like a guy on a huge coffee craving but only has one Starbucks in his town...and they only have tea. Where do I even begin searching?
