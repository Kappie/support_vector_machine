Yesterday my brother came into my room, and I was unfortunately leaving to take a shit at the time, so I said I had to go to the toilet. He replied by asking me if I want a “nappy” xD Smart kid.      Now, for the more serious issue. In EAP today, Yoshi brought up the idea of becoming roommates when we go to Uni. Being the totally heterosexual individual that I am, the first thought that came into my mind was not “Oh, people will think we’re faggots”, no, that thought came second. My first thought was “hmmm, this could be a good thing.” But now I will analyse the good and the bad properly.         The Good         Cheaper lodgings. Dividing the rent of any flat would be great, since this means I get more money from whatever it is I’ll do for a part-time job.      Better food. Let’s face it, I may be a living god, but anything of food based substance I will ultimately make it inedible. He can apparently cook, that’s a plus. Less costs on having to constantly buy take-out xD      Lack of loneliness. This itself creates less chances of becoming depressed and thus incapable of continuing on when shit goes bad.  Sure, I’ll be constantly surrounded by countless babes, but this is beside the point. The feeling of loneliness stems from having no real connections to people, so you are actually better off with just normal friends then having girlfriends who you actually have to care about to the point of sexual interests. I mean, friends you don’t have to please them in the same way I guess. xD Easier maintenance.      I can’t think of anything else xD                The Bad                Like, the whole idea is so totally grosssssssss. Hahaha, no, it’s just odd. As if spending all this time with my family hasn’t been enough to crush my liberty, leaving and ending up with an old mate again? Poh xD      I’m honestly scared to death of the following scenario.            I come home with a stunning beauty, like the previous days, but this time the plan in which Yoshi buggers off someplace else for the night has gone terribly wrong. He comes out of his room and says out loud “Heeeeeey Daaaaaam, you seen my hand lotion?” Off scampers the chick, to tell all her chick friends that I’m gay.          *shivers*          frustration that comes with marriage xD You have to see the person every day, no breaks. I’m not ready for the commitment xD        Conclusion       It actually seems the good outweighs the bad. Ugh. Well, we’ll see how shit goes in the near future. Hahaha, I can always look back on this for final conclusions.     And you can always COMMENT. SLUTS xD            Everybody can comment, but it’s under anonymous if you’re not a member. Aren’t I the best-est?           Praise Dammo!
