    
       I will be leaving on Wednesday (the thirtieth) for a series of vacations that may lead me to absence until July eighteenth. Here is how it pans out:   On Wednesday I will leave with my dad and best friend,  urlLink Cullen , to Alpine Lake, California. My mom and sister will already be there. We will camp until Saturday the third.   Then, on the fourth, I will leave for my lacrosse camp in Santa Barbara. That is four days, from the fifth to the eighth. I will return home either on the eighth or the ninth.   Then, on the tenth, I will leave with that same friend and his family for a strange mystical place called Mather, where supposedly fun will abound.   I will return the seventeenth or eighteenth. Don't miss me too much. When I return I will begin on that quest to make a good design for this. Maybe I can get somebody to design me a logo and/or template at deviant urlLink ART
