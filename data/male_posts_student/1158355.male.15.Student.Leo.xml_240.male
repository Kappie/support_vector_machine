If James doesn't do it, I probably won't. I'm not supposed to talk too much about this baseball League because it's sorta confidential for the people who weren't invited. Ah what the hell, it's stupid. It's just a bunch of Paul and Jared's best friends on a baseball team, woooo big secret. Anyways, excited that I'm going to see Aerosmith the 22nd (last day of testing) and I've been listening to alot of them lately, they're awesome. I took the speaking for Italian Regents yesterday and got a 23 out of 24. So happy it's over. That scared me but yet she's very nice when it's just you and her. And one of the things was we had to figure out a way how to get into Tom Cruise's pad while he was filming a movie. What else, uh...I learned awesome Brazilian Samba on my set. It took a half an hour or so do get down the fucking beat because its so complicated but it's fun when you get it down, just pop in a Ricky Martin cassette and bam, you're a pro. You know what I hate, scientist experiments on bunnies. Oh and look at the white bunny with a block dot, damn scientists and their bunny ice pack experiments. Scientists are cruel to bunnies, I wish I could stick a gigantic ice pack on a scientists pack and watch him/her get gangrene. Normally I don't care for animals except bunnies and penguins and some other things...some dogs. Every bunny deserves to live a happy nourished life in fields of wheat. Without gay ass cats that live across the street from you start attacking them. I wish I had a bb gun...oh Jared...Oh yea my nose just started randomly gushing blood today in English which was awesome and exciting and I started getting all jumpity because I never get a bloody nose and I never knew how much fun it is. First of all bloody noses don't hurt and second of all the blood just oozes out like your some kind of jellyman. The bad part was my teacher made me go to the nurse. I insisted I was fine. Jesus just a little bit of blood and that teacher freaks out. WEIRDED OUT. I'm freaking myself out because now I'm reading this over and I can't believe what I wrote. I'm a psycho. This summer is gonna kick ass. I really don't wanna get a job so besides job this is the line up...BASEBALL, DRUMS, FRIENDS. Good day to you too.
