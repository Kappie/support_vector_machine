But thats on me, not them. Well, what I want to say is that I can be a lot worse. But I'm not. So they should cut me some slack.  I could wear all black and try to cut myself. I could bust a sag and listen to horrible music. I could just be really dumb. But I'm average. And I think thats okay most of the time. Of course, I do get dissappointed and sad when there's someone who is better than me at something which I care a lot about. But, thats life and I can't do anything about it, except work harder and try to be in their shoes someday.  I was thinking, what if I was given the chance to take a glimpse at the future. Would I take it? And I think that I wouldn't. It would ruin the surprise. So I was thinking that what if I took a glimpse but then I forgot about it. So that my curiosity would be satisfied but the surprise still held? I think thats impossible. Sinceit could have happened already. Some stranger probably asked me one day in the past if I wanted to see my future. And I said yes. And it was a good/okay future. Happy and junk. But then afterwards he wiped my memory so the future would come true. But then I'm here now wondering. So it didn't work.   I think what I really want is to be in that future. So that I couldn't make the future not happen. Since I'm already in it. You know? I want to know who I will end up with. Where I will live. What I will do? Stuff like that.  But I guess I have to wait.  Later.
