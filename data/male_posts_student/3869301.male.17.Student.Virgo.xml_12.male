We get the big 200 count tray and see how many we can eat on the way home. I am sooooo full of nugget it is not funny. I think we have some left...  We got to the mall early today, so while my mother and sister went shopping for underwear or something I went to Suncoast. This is one of my favorate stores at the mall (my favorate is the EB, not EB Games, yet, and my third favorate is Build-A-Bear, because Laura Katherine works there and it is fun to drop in on her from time to time, to bad today she was busy with a party). At Suncoast though there is this kinda hot girl that I love talking with about movies. She is the only female I talk to regularly that knows movies as well as I do. So I am hanging out there chating with her about Kill Bill, the Star Wars trilogy finally being released on DVD, Donnie Darko vs A Walk to Remember, and such. Very soon after I get done discussing how Lucus can remaster Star Wars after it has been remaster at least three times already I realize I am smitten. As we talk I find Ginger is a ULAR student, a huge movie buff, perky friend to all customers, and SHE HAS A KID!!!! Fuck... Shit... Damn... While I was there I got Bubba Ho-Tep. So the vistit to the store was not a total loss.  I don't know if I will post tomorrow. I might if I have some time between packing stuff. I might also post something this week if I get to a computer, but you better not count on it. If Andy would quit macking on Sam for a few minutes and tweek the site a bit you might see less blah and more blog. Oh! I might also try to start writing movie reviews. I need to talk with Andy about a rating system because he had some good ideas for a rating system, but we need to perfect them. A universal ratings system for the rickscales dot com family of sites would be fun.  Now about those nuggets...
