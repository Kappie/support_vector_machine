First of all im playing tin this massive football game like in a stadium, I'm not sure where, I dont even play football so anyway theres this hairdresser there who looks like this woman I saw at the Chili's and my mum then warns me that shes 'the worlds most annoying hairdresser' so throughout the game shes trying to cut my hair and play around with it so i start shouting "I'll cut your hair in a minute"! Then shes sat there eating something whilst I'm searching through all these boxes for pairs of scissors but all I can find is style things and such. Anyhow eventually she chases after me and I grab this MASSIVE how to cut hair book and beat her up with it. And then the whole dream turns into this computer game that looked a bit like the zoomed out version of habbo hotel and all these policeman were running around and there was me and the woman but I wasnt sure what character I was and then I realised I was me and the beat her but then all the police handcuffed me and then next thing I knew I was in this courtroom that was just a glass box where I looked around and on the side of the hairdresser were all her family but they were all Africans... and on my side nobody was there it was all empty benches. Then the case begins but I'm in my pyjamas so anyhow JASON from big brother is the first to say something and he says something like "If he even had a fight with his hampster how can he withstand all the breaks in his legs" and I start shouting about my operations and casts to him and then the judge stands up and its the QUEEN! I know the Queen... its so odd. Anyhow then  I shut up and look at the back where all these Indian people are sat laughing then look up out of the window and theres these mean in blue shirts and stuff and they start smiling and then one of them who looks like this guy off this film I saw once (not sure of his name or what film) he starts like making crude gestures at the Queen and then the image goes back to the court room and everyones screaming and cheering for them for standing up to the Queen and then suddenly it goes back to the men who now have bullet proof pads on and have guns and they get into this blue car and then drive off and straight after that all these black hummers drive in and loads of Japanese guys (who look like the guys in Kill Bill 1 where she must kill like all 100 of them before getting to the boss), they all jump out of these hummers in slow motion weilding there guns, back in the coutroom the Queen says "This is clearly unsafe, everyone go to London" then every goes through this back door where all my friends are like Lee, Nick, Xav and Ben and the Queens there and women dressed in football style shorts and shirts but the back room of the courtroom is like a football locker room so anyway I try to jump through the glass (which has the Queen standing by it) but it doesn't smash... CAUSE ITS ON HINGES and it just opens like a door and then all these Japanese men do the slow motion running over these really green hills and then I woke up...  I swear I'm not lying that was my dream it was so odd...
