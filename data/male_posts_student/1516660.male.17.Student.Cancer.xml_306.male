After that, I called everyone to make sure they are up. I ate my breakfast then went out to meet my friends. Oh yes, I got a feeling WQ will bring a small bag, not big enough to contain my Sims CDs. HaHa. Surprise surprise. I met Wendy on the bus to Woodlands. So "suey". :D  Hmmm....Me and Wendy were the first to arrive. WQ then arrived, followed shortly by Eugene and Yean Seng. Oh my...they are here! ...! Amanda was kinda late (hey, I even mistook a lady for Amanda. I call her "oei!" So embarrassing!!). We went to MacDonalds to eat first (Me, WQ, Amanda and Wendy...the two went to Yishun) while waiting for Cherie and ShinHan. SH joined us in Mac, and after finishing breakfast, we went to the MRT. We took the JE-bound train and changed trains to get to Clementi, a stop away. We have to wait for the two boys, who lagged behind.  HaHa. We took a bus to Ngee Ann. Heh Heh. Hmm, soon we spilt up lor. I went with Amanda, Wendy and Cherie, while the rest of the boys stayed in their own group. We were like kinda lost, but we found our way to the Main Hall. The boys went to Engineering, while we went to the Media, Sciences, Early Childhood and Business. I like the Business lecturer. So cool! :D I like the school, kinda. Meow moo!  After that, we went to the Atrium. We brought some rice to eat, while the boys went to tour the CCA booths. We finished eating then we went to the busstop, where they came just in time to catch the shuttle bus. Oh! Tsz Hin was with them! We took the bus to Clementi Interchange, where we took 147 towards Dover MRT, interlinked to Singapore Poly.   SP was also confusing. We got lost again. Oh my meow! Moo Meow! After some long long walking, we finally found our way to the Concourse. Wendy and Amanda went to the courses they wanted. After touring, we went down to the canteen to meet the boys. After some time, we started on our way home.  Cherie and Amanda are going to Bugis, while the rest of us are going towards Woodlands. Me, Wendy and WQ are going to Wendy's house to play MahJong. :D We arrived at her house at around 2 something. HeHe. First, it was we three and Auntie playing MahJong. Can I mention again that I like playing MahJong with Auntie? I always enjoy myself! So fun one! We played till KL came, who took over Auntie and played till 6 something. HaHa. Such a fun game. Me and WQ left for home first. Moo meow!   I arrived back home at 6 something, bathed, ate dinner while watching TV and came online. Aspiring Author replied! She thanked me for my reply and says her friend agreed with her. Heh. Hmm..YAY! WQ is quitting YJ! YAY!!! A meowing cat to talk to all the time! A duck to identify with! YAY!!! I am so happy for him! He can be free, free from the pathetic excuse they call a school! Meow meow meow meow!!  Okay. I already decided who I am going to take to the MTV Asia Awards. Oh yes! It's...Koo Wen Qiang! Meow! :)  Okay. I am kinda late for my AI. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
