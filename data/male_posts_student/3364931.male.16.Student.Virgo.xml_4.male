Well went for my J-train meeting today at TBSC...it was...awesome...the people are so nice there....especially the sd peeps...haha...as if i dunno in the first place anyway.... then i met this really nice gal, who is 20 this year and we actually took a bus ride (1 1/2 hours) and talked about everthing under the sun ! wow...she is super nice, yeah and i think we can really relate to in many levels...except physically...as it may be quite nightmarish and mentally disturbing to me...hahahaha kidding ! but seriously...this gal huh...is so full of life and jumpy and like those happy-go-lucky sort of gal...hahah...very sweet....dont think she's doing it for the sake of entertaining me though...so i guess she's sincere...hahah...that's cool...how many of these type of peeps do you meet in ur lifetime ?
