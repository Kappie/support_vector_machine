Feeling very happy everyday! if i am not wrong hor .... ask anyone close to me ... they haven't seen me angry before. cuz i extremely seldom get angry! its like.... get angry for wad? waste ur enerrgy, time blah bla.... but if there is something that u hav to be firm with, be firm and serious with it! but u hafta let it go once it is done. well that is my philosophy. StAy happie always, despite of your everyday life!~ oh yah .... i juz cut my hair yesterday.... hahax .... bleahx. i juz came back from oikos like 1 hr ago. omg! my blogg ish getting shorter and shorter day by day! hahaahax. anyway.... to those people who are having the common test now....   Father Lord in Heaven, I come before You Lord to pray for all those people out there Lord. That Lord, You will guide them and give them the wisdom that they need for this period, while they have their common test in school Lord. Father that You will give them good health so that they will be able to pass the test with flying colours Lord. Father i pray that you will remove all the distraction that comes before them Lord. Father that through this Lord, that they might be able to glorify your Holy Name Lord. I thank You Lord, in Jesus' name, AMEN!   Good luck for your test guys! study hard!
