I was kinda happy in getting a C+ though a lot of other people got B, B+ and A. The 72/100 is already a nice start, I just can’t score lower than that to get something more decent…  I was kinda sad as well because I didn’t get full marks in the IVT question (10 points)…well, it was not that difficult, I actually found it easy and it was in that question that I had the most plausible solution…yet, Doc Mara only gave me 5 points in it…too bad! I would have been happier if I got a C and full marks in that question…all the same…it was not as bad as it could have been…just more efforts to get a B/B+/A…  I had more “fine revisions” in my thesis statement for English…Gimo apparently remembered to further correct out thesis statements…The thing about his class is you are so unlucky if you get to be the “Example of The Day”…luckily, I have already been chosen so maybe I will not be chosen again…just maybe…  We are doing the outline for the full 10-page term paper in English and though there are no classes for English on Wednesday, we are supposed to pass the papers to the beadle…  Cayanan, on the other hand, discussed and wrapped up The Summer Solstice by Nick Joaquin kanina…It was a nice story, nice in the most literary sense…It had a lot of ideologies behind it and it has a lot of good qualities…  We are supposed to have a debate-thingy next Wednesday and the winning group gets 20 points worth of quiz while the losing group gets whatever the two other English faculty members Mark will invite will give them.  So there…I do hope Raj did/is doing our Filipino project nicely…I mean, I could have helped but I can not, owing to the fact that the CD can not be opened…hence, no pictures…  So that’s probably it…  --Logged Out--
