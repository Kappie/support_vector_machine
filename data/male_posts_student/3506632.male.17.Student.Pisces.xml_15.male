A mountain, located near Quetta and dubbed Jabl e Noor ul Quran,has been tunneled extensively and is kept as a sort of permanent store for now unusable pages of the Quran. According to tradition pages no more usable are either buried or put in a flowing river. Some Haji had a brain wave and decided to start this project to protect forever such pieces of holy script.  Yesterday I went to an academy in Islamabad and what a brilliant English teacher I get to meet. According to him an off day can only refer to holidays and not days with less than regular activity (like on and off seasons for sports etc.) and the meaning of overrated is only excessive and has no relation with its etymological root rate. Snubbing me over my attempts to correct his fallacy he started taking refuge behind the fact that the books answer supported him (we were doing an MCQ) not realising that his was a lucky case where two wrongs made one right. Another bunker of his was that the word fishy has no relation with its root fish, again missing that fish is known to be slippery and any dubious or fishy deal doesn't come to the eye completely as something slippery doesn't come to the hand completely.
