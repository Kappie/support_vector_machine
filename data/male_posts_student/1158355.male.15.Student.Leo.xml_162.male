One boy had no chance for dodge, he was pinned between a car and fence, chances are by an angry teen. Girls find themselves all paranoid in that one spot, where the stalker waits. My cousin almost gets killed by a car, because a gay drunk lunatic was speeding. People killing people over race. Injustice for anybody, freedom isn't free, Shall we ever meet peace between these foreigns and our own kind? I think not. Damn the cops, damn the president, damn the teachers and fuck all authority. Shall people be sentenced to life in bars, I choose death over that. Nobody should be jailed, only exiled to a land where nobody can be harmed by oneself. Why should anyone listen to anyone? Why should I have to listen to you? Why should I have to listen to the people who claim power? These questions are asked by the very minds of the people who are nothing but primative cerebriums attempting to understand the world we live today such as myself. Democracy is defined through Dictating laws and irony spreads throughout the nation as hipocratic leaders send out their bullshit to the convinced people who are a minority to "knowledge." I'm sick of people like me who complain about this world, but it shouldn't be this way. It wasn't ment to be. Humans cannot live without suffering and war, eternal peace being inevitably impossible. Why are secrets held from us every day while others only by illusion are stronger, know of these confidential matters? I know certain people hate these complaints, but now I'm giving in. I'm reaching the source and understanding it all, it's pain and to vanquish it all, to eradicate this fate, would be improbable because the superiority needs to survive. Now save the cops, save the president, save the authority, because now you realise they keep this world under control and to continue the fate, and that the evil is unknown to every human on this planet. Somewhere outside you think, somewhere outside this universe, outside the spiral, I'm reaching out. You strive to figure out who it is you want to blame, but nothing appears, no signs. Nothing but black space with white stars, and the gaseous galaxies far into the distance that aren't even there, they are only printed onto a wall of no memory, no existance, it's only a painting. Eventually you conclude that long ago outside of this illusion, after falling sun and flesh, led by the rise of this once named minority, that a renessaince, no a revolution has occured but then you say, "It's too late." Too late too choose, too late to change. Sad that evolution has killed the true mind, and brought in the superiority of those who don't feel our emotions, and that minorities have claimed the throne, are now the absolute majorities. Not fair you say. You don't even understand this writing, poem, whatever the hell you want to call it. I don't either. The truth is I don't understand this poem either because it is truth and fiction, real and illusionary.  I'm sick of this life. I'm sick of being such a dumb species. I'm sick of humans needing religion in order to live under control. I'm sick of people not being able to accept a realistic truth.  The matter of this opinion is, I don't even know if I'm right. Nobody does, no matter how long humans exist, we will never know anything but that we are using our mind to think. One day I spend just staring around, relaxing, pretending I know, but I don't, and I have to forget about it all because I may just never know until I die. Relax, forget about reasoning and beliefs, just relax and have a load of fun before you're life is gone. Hopefully when we die, the truth is revealed and we experience the first day of our real lives. "To other worlds, aliens see our world as an actual hell." - The man I think is my father. Humans are primitave and imperfect, but maybe we're the smartest out there along with being the only ones out there. Many beliefs are made. I have many theories. None can be proved now. But if this world is...    One more soldier reports to heaven, he's served his time in hell.
