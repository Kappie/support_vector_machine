She is alittle upset over it, even though it is a really good score and we are all happy for her. In my opinion, the 4 shows that she isn't anal about history and actually led a live during the school year. I am thinking that my score (the mail) might come around 1 o'clock so I am still hoping for a 4! Wish me good luck.  For at least 2 more posts, I will be focusing on my AP score just because that is the most major part of my life right now.
