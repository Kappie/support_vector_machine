I've had all week and I haven't come up with anything really interesting to write an article about. Thing is, I could write about anything! And I've got nothing, oh well.  In other stuff, here's a good link to put up,  urlLink www.sexylosers.com . I haven't been there in a while, but its a damn funny comic made by some white dude in the anime style. WARNING: Crude sexual humour and brief nudity! So dun visit if you've got parents around. Also, its fairly far along, so you might haveta go back in the series, if you see its a comic that's part of a series of its own. Pretty funny tho, deserving of the side navigation bar...HINT...  I'm not an expert with HTML, and I dunno how to make those fancy bullet things Conrad makes, so I'll just list more of these thinghys that are some good resources for, whatever you're into  - urlLink MxTabs.net  - for all your guitar tab needs, also has some good user-written articles. If what you're lookin' for isn't there... - urlLink Ultimate-guitar Archive  - for anyother stuff. Site's a bit weird to navigate at times tho. - urlLink ZeroPaid  - THE P2P network, for all P2P news - urlLink Filesharing Talk  - for anything real specific on P2P progs.  All done, go to hell!
