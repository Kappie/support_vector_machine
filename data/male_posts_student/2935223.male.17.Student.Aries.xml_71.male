I dunno know what to say right now....besides the fact that Brittany and Tascha are DA KOOLEST!!!  Steve was there too...I guess he's kinda kool....:- Sorry about bein' so antisocial at Brittany's.....but, I realized that I had been hurt really bad by sumone.....and didn't even notice because of my own stupidity.  So, I wasn't in the keenest mood to hang around sum people...and no, it was not because of who it usually is....which was a nice change.  I'm gonna go, before I make myself more depressed....'cause we can't go to the beach today...and I really wanted to.   I still want to hang out with people if sumone wanted to call me and be like "Hey, I'm bored.  Let's do SUMTHIN'!!!"  That'd be sweet...too bad it's not gonna happen... Peace!  Spense
