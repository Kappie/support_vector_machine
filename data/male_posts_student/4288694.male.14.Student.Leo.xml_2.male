Anyway, I feel that penning down feelings in the intricate and multifarious www is just a little too sentimental...haha, no offence for those who demur...so I will just post something else for a change...Here's a paradox to start with...  Happiness or a ham sandwich?  Which is better, eternal happiness or a ham sandwich? It would appear that eternal happiness is better, but this is really not so! After all, nothing is better than eternal happiness, and a ham sandwich is certainly better than nothing. Therefore a ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness.
