MrBubbles6965: i think thats a great idea sWeeTaRt11887: nope MrBubbles6965: y is it not? sWeeTaRt11887: because sWeeTaRt11887: first off sWeeTaRt11887: i am not getting drunk MrBubbles6965: and y not? sWeeTaRt11887: because i don't like feeling out of control of my own body or judgements MrBubbles6965: you've never gotten drunk have you sWeeTaRt11887: no, but i don't want to try it MrBubbles6965: hahahahahahahahah sWeeTaRt11887: why is that funny? MrBubbles6965: its so naive of you sWeeTaRt11887: why? sWeeTaRt11887: i know the risks involved of getting drunk sWeeTaRt11887: not only physical risks but what could happen if i lose my judgement sWeeTaRt11887: not only that, but we're underage MrBubbles6965: HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAH sWeeTaRt11887: and i don't care how funny yu think it is sWeeTaRt11887: that's my opinion and it's not changing  she has some good points but once she drinks...she will realize that its not that big a deal and worth it. i think. w/e
