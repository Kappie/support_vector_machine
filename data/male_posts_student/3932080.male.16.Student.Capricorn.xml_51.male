So, the Roots chose to electrify and commercialize on this disc, in a way not to become electrocuted and burned out by that very fence (which may be caused by continuing their less commercial, more experiment sound of both “Things…” and “Phrenology”). That older Roots sound, which has come to be somewhat expected, is the “keeping it real” of Black Thought’s aforementioned diction, so shifting sound and style becomes the blueprint for much of “The Tipping Point,” a blueprint simplified into lyric during the choral attack of “Boom!”: “What we have here is a brand new sound.”  Taking a Phish-like approach to making this album, the Roots apparently jammed upwards of 25 minutes for each track, then nitpicked select beats to use to form song structures. Nitpicking, though, just starts to define their process, for each track then became a packaged piece of artsy hip-hop to potentially hit radio stations and t.v. stations. Much of the focus for this album is jazz, unlike the genre-hopping “Phrenology” of 2002. Perhaps, then, “Stay Cool” becomes the inevitable centerpiece, taking a secondhand De La Soul beat that morphs from a sunny-day jazz stroll to freestyle saxophone over a paranoid backing section. The lyrics push one of the simpler messages on the album (aside from the scat-babble attempted in the “Don’t Say Nuthin’” chorus): “Stay cool muthafucka’s y’all know the rules.” “Boom!” lies in the same vein; it sounds like a jazz-scratch response to the Beastie Boy’s recent “Ch-Ch-Check it Out.” With sax stabs and DJ wiggle alternating over trash-can drumming, Black Thought hyper-spits lines as happening as they are absurd (“It’s Black, code name Yafet Koto Ock”), seeming to play the harder, wiser cousin to Alfred Molina’s Spiderman-bashing Doc Ock. That antagonism is not foreign to Black Thought, and it becomes the role he most often slips into throughout “The Tipping Point.”  Spiteful and cocky are his words in the lead single, the two-faced “Don’t Say Nuthin’” (first face: commercial flop, second face: verbal drive-by through Chinatown), as he denounces the lesser and commends the greater, the Roots, and the great, himself. That beat (which oddly evokes Bow Wow’s “Let’s Get Down”) is pure Eastern-tinged funk, much like “Duck Down!,” a club-hopping Timbaland-esque track, boasting a sound seemingly achieved effortlessly that many of today’s producers try to imitate. Black Thought again plays the villain, potentially one-upping the late Hova by claiming to “spit what your wig absorb, sicker than sycamore.” Aside from self-endorsement, though, Thought takes a few political jabs, pronouncing that “every record ain’t a record just to shake behinds” over bleeding guitar funk and crawling bass dribble in “Guns are Drawn,” and later condemning those who “pray to Coca-Cola instead of the gods” in “Why (What’s Goin On?).”  All cockiness, jazziness, and seriousness aside, ?uestlove turns around his recent employment as Dave Chappelle’s music manager for “The Mic,” the first of the album’s pair of bonus tracks. Pure brouhaha, the Roots pull a Danger Mouse and drop what sounds like a Stones snippet beneath a rollicking crowd of hipsters (among them Chappelle) who claim to love the mic more than even the most impressive consolation, the opposite sex. This, of course, puts the mic and music above an endless list of wordly things, not to exclude the ever-feared concept of commercial success.  That commercial success is seen on “The Tipping Point” as the Roots cut out many elements of their past: A-list verbalists (Talib and Mos flow right off of the tongue), neo-soul styling (we’re thinking “Break You Off”), and clever wordplay in choruses to name a few. But, while high production values tend to classify this disc as being a commercial push, that never-failing mouth of Tariq Trotter (BT) puts the Roots right back on the cutting edge of commercialism. “They made a lot of money, [but] money never made them,” he aptly points out on “I Don’t Care,” a sequel to “Rock You!” In essence, it isn’t the money, the fame, the pop charts, or the girls that matter to the “legendary Roots crew.” It’s the thought, black or white, that they create music to be heard and loved, whether underground or more mainstream. This album sides with the latter, but nevertheless will bounce and bob with every spin. The only difference becomes, then, that where you drew the line, the Roots marked the tipping point.
