It is about time to bring in some new topics. As a result of watching   True Life  on MTV and reading  Hanging on to Max , both books about Teenage Pregnancy,  we  thought we would put our own two cents in.  Pregnancy. We all go... "Eww.. you have to fuck to get to that point!" That is very true, which is why I lose some, or a lot, of couples in certain situations. Last time I checked, you both consented to what you did and by abstaining, it would not have occurred at all. But here you are now, you are fucked (literally!). You were caught in a situation and now you can't go back.  Let's move past prevention. It is a lost cause, prevention that is. Our young, innocent, and at time "oversaturated" minds, refuse to listen to any logic! No matter how much information is pounded into our minds, we reject it or passively accept it. Too bad for us! Is it our problem that we don't listen? Of course! If we would actually open our eyes and ears and face reality, we would NOT have these problems. Sadly yet so, we do.
