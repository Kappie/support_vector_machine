I think i'd rather get drunk at home instead of sitting at a table surrounded by people I don't like playing pool. I'm sure it would be cheaper, as well. I have a whopping 3 dollars left in my bank account. And a 20 dollar bill for gas until payday on Friday at 12:01am. I spent 600 dollars in 2 weeks. I think that's a new record for me. Granted, some of it was on Christmas.  The last year has been...well, interesting. I think I've changed so much. I feel like I don't even know the person I was back then. Can you really be compared to yourself...I mean, we all change so much in the course of a year, can we even be considered the same person? In a way I don't think so, but there's another part of me that knows nobody ever changes  completely , and there will always be part of what once was in all of us.  Bah.   RESOLUTIONS  1. Stop living from pay cheque to pay cheque. 2. Put 200 dollars a cheque away for school 3. Really decide what I want to do for a career 4. Hunt down and have reunions with at least 3 people from my past.  Meh. I'm rambling. I probably won't write tomorrow night...so, Happy New Year, guys... To each his own, and to each a great year!  urlLink  postCount('end2002');
