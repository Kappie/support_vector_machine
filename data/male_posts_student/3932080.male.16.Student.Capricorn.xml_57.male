Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink 100 Years -Five For Fighting  Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #28  After emerging as the  Adult Contemporary  body double for  Ben Folds  with “Superman (It’s Not Easy)” in late 2000,  John Ondrasik  of  Five for Fighting  fortunately took on a much bigger role. As of now, he is our generation’s  Elton John , not in dress or sexual preference, but in sound, and “100 Years” is his “Tiny Dancer.” This irresistible piano jam, fusing music box pianism and  Ondrasik’s  warm voice, is the best thing of its sort since  Folds’  “Brick.” Like grammar, though, Ondrasik's lyrics set the stage for some exceptions to his rule; he sings that “we've only got 100 years to live.” What about  Rick James , bitch?   The Verdict:  9.5/10 - The Fork   (4.75/5)     2004 Best Singles Club Entry
