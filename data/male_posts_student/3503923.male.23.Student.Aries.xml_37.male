A screw loose in your saddle, a temperature failure in your freezer.  Does it grate you, knowing that things will change? Does it tear inside, when I tell you how weak you are?  Are you happy to be missing the last train, night after night? Do you carry on cycling with a punctured inner tube? An unforeseen break-down, alarms ringing in the melt-down, an inconvenient blip.  Does it grate you, knowing that things will change? Does it throw you, when your agenda is subject to approval?  Does the light remain in your eyes when you hear NO too often? Would there be hope in your life if you could no longer party? Ripping through the darkness, disturbing your scene, arriving unannounced.  Does it grate you, knowing that things will change? Does it annoy you, not having it your own way?
