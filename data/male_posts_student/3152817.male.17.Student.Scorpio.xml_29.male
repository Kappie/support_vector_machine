It's almost a fact that Gore would have won had the pessimistic trial lawyer (no...not John Edwards) not ran.    The 2004 election could end with the Dems in the same sinking ship as 2000.  Nader is back and this time over 5% of his campaign funds are coming from Republican donors.  Yes, you heard it right; Republicans are donating a lot of money to hard-core left winger Ralph Nader.  Is this because theyâ€™re sick of Bush?  Not likely.  If they were truly sick of Bush, why not just give that money to the most liberal democratic ticket of all time, a ticket that includes another trial lawyer, and one that is actually elect able?
