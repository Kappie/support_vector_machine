It drives me straight up the wall Makes me run and run and run To light at the end of the hall.  Will it be the safe-haven? I will see it in my haste. Passion drives me to act in Ways that aren't in good taste.  It drives me away from it Yet pulls me to even stronger. Passion is not a short thing, It often lasts much longer.  Passion for it drives me To reach new highs on high. Then it pulls me down again, The feeling it's all a lie.  Passion is a great love of something, Could be for someone ... sure. Passion's one bad thing is It leaves you aching for more.  There we go... Yet another poem from my first site.  I must say I like this one better than the first two.  Any comments would be great!
