I went to Chris' to see if he wanted to come and he did, so we went into town, I met my girlfriendand got to the Academy at about 6.30 and went inside to meet Chimaira! Unfortunately Mark and Chris weren't there but I still got to hang out with the rest of them for a while! I took a few pictures and got my stuff signed. Then I went into the concert hall and watched them play. Incredible. They played for 70 minutes. Some old, some new and an amazing 10 minute drum solo. I come out with some injuries which is an obvious sign I had a good time. I hope they come back soon. Mandy come back home with me to stay. We didn't get back until pretty late! I was so tired when we got home and I have really fucked my leg up worse than it already is. Anyway, I'm tired still, so goodbye... xx
