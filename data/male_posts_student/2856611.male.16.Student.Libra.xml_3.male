So yeah, yesterday was pretty screwed up I mentioned yesterday how about the whole arguemnt with Charli but now it's worse, we went out to try and sort it out but lets just say It didn't turn out well at all. Firstly we went to Starbucks, we stood there awkwardly not touching, hugging or anything so were sat upstairs each end of the table, I then realise just how much I might lose and i get tears in my eyes, so then I spend the next hour trying to get her to talk to me, which jsut ended up with me crying... and no thats not a GAY thing to do grrr. So eventually we ended up 'ok' we agree'd I was a bastard and decided to go to the cinema, on the way to the cinema, we talked and had alot of fun we ran around and laughed and it was great and then we kissed and I said "your a very special person, and who ever gets to be with you is so lucky" to which she replied "I guess you lucky then" I was so happy, so we spent a while messing around then eventually we got to the cinema and bought some tickets to... *Sigh* the Butterfly Effect. We got hungry and went to Burger King but before that we sat on the steps of Ster Century and talked which was totally cool, I know at this point your thinking - "So things turned out ok?" but they did'nt we got to Burger King... had some food, got all the way to the cinema, then things went bad, we sat there and I went to kiss her and she just stared blankly... so I left it, I asked her if she was upset with me still and she was, I didn't know what to do. I tried to make her feel more comftorble but nothing, I left to go to the toilet where I stared at myself in the mirror and realised how much I screwed up, went back and spent the rest of the film with tears rolling down my face and like EVERY fucking time I stopped something happened in the film that made me start again it was NOT the film to go and see... so fucking screwed up, the only part I laughed at was when he had no arms and he said something, I cant even remember. At the end of the film I just cried and couldn't stop and I told her that I didn't mean or want any of this to happen and that I loved her and she told me she loved me too... we hugged and then on the way down we decided to go on a break until I could get over this girl and I think I am, yesterday made me realise that I didn't want her if this was going to happen, yesterday upset me so god damn much... I would rather just be with Charli, but she wont believe that. Anyhow, Charli got upset when we were waiting to go home and I promised her things would be okay, we hugged but then when we got to my house not even a hug... I guess things need time... Today I'm getting my hair cut and meeting up with Betty for coffee's hopefully I will feel a bit better at the end of the day. See you around.
