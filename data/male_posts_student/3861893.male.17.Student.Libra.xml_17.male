If not, it would be a failure. And, as it turns out, it was a failure. A total failure. Had Tharman been there, he would have died of shame. It was so shameful.  I didn't even know what I was doing there in the first place. All I know is that the only reason why I went to school today was to hand up some dumb econs essay. I should have handed them up yesterday. Me and my big mouth. I told my dear "stressed" econs rep that I will hand in today. Sigh. Should have followed her advice and completed them yesterday. Had I done so, I would not have undergone those torturing hours in the "sports complex", watching some dumb people playing some dumb musical chairs. Damn dumb.  Went for lunch after that dumb thing ended. Lunch was okay, ate a couple of pieces of sinfully oily chicken. Haha. I'm gonna become fat. Who cares? Went down to Bugis where I walked aimlessly around that complex, not knowing what to buy. I wanted to come down here to buy some stuff, but just didn't know what to buy. Nah, I'm not trying to imitate Caleb who spends half his life buying stuff in town. I seriously needed to buy. Kerjin was there with me, walking aimlessly as well. Haha. Enjoyed the chat with her about some "classification". And then, there was this unspoken consensus thing. What twelve o'clock. . Oh yar, there is still this "I love pigs" thing. Haha. Damn funny Sometimes, chats like this can help relieve stress. I seriously need to relieve some stress after some "interesting" national day celebration.  Reached home about 4 plus. Slacked all the way till dinner. Didn't really feel like doing anything. Who cares whether prelims is in 16 days? Shit, the days are really numbered. 16, 15, 14, 13,.....Time is running out....  Men talk of killing time, while time quietly kills them.  ~Dion Boucicault  The Present is a Point just passed.  ~David Russell  Time is an equal opportunity employer.  Each human being has exactly the same number of hours and minutes every day.  Rich people can't buy more hours.  Scientists can't invent new minutes.  And you can't save time to spend it on another day.  Even so, time is amazingly fair and forgiving.  No matter how much time you've wasted in the past, you still have an entire tomorrow.  ~Denis Waitely
