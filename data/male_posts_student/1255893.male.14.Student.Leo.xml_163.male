They ARE hott arent they. man, talkin w/ johnny and findin answers to his questions  ....... it felt ..... great. I mean, I always feel great lookin for answers to stuff. Is there a way to make money off that? maybe i could write books on this shizzle. damn capitalism. Eh. Money makes the world go round ........ hmm..... what was that old saying bout money being the root of all evil?   Today i got tons of hugs. that always seems to happen when it rains. Water's sexy like that aint it? Holy Jebus if only i had a bit less amount of work to do. It would make it so much easier to jus kick back and let it all run through me. It was rainin on the walk home too. I was listenin to no doubt ..... then i hear a clash of thunder and it starts to pour and ........ wooooooooaaaah. Such awesome shat. I shouldve added more incubus to that CD. Bleh.  we'll have to leave that till next time.    I have to look up the words to this song.... sooooo sexxy 8-) I love how when i write ...... i feel so calm. and havin music at the same time only makes it that much better. I have to look up the meanin to Incubus too...... cus I know it's supposed to be a thing... besides a band. If anyone knows be sure to tell me.   I wonder if i can find a way to make money jus havin conversatins with people? Honest to Jebus, if I ever find a way to do that ..... yeah.  I'll go do that right ........nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnow           *no charge :-p*    obviously I didn't origionally intend to post this ..... but y not?
