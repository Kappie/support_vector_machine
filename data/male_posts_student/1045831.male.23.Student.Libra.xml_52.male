I rmember parts of being in McKay's buddy Eric's frat house and Talking about how you need to keep the dope fiends at bay and the Bowie knife is the best means of this..  I attribute that to reading too much Hunter Thompson..  Drinking and Hunter thompson seem to go hand in hand but really just make me act even nuttier than usual.  But anyway on to more of my life about  2 weeks since I have written anything..  Last weekend we had Formal at the Hyatt.  Yeah thats right, Zeke dressed up.. what a scary thought..  I took claudia and it was fun..  Paul and Kristen went too and there are some photos of it at  urlLink here ..  Kristen and paul were there but of course they went to bed early because they can't hang with the king of all partying..  yours truly..  Me and claudia stayed up drinking late into the night.. hanging out with everyone having drunken conversations and a generally good time...  Then we went to bed and after claudia fell asleep I got hungry and room service was closed so I went to check out the minibar.  Of course no prices listed on there so I called down tot he desk..  Multiple times just because I was drunk and stupid which tends to happen..  They sent up someone with a list of all the prices..  of course 1.50 for a candy bar and 2.5 for some pringles is expensive but I was drunk so i ate one of each.. then had the wise ideas to seal the stuff back up and put it back..   Screwed the hotel out of some chips and chocolate.. I am such a smart kid..  well  I'm in the middle of a war with my coms teacher right now and I have to finish my speech So I'm off to do that  but I just figured i would give you guys an update since I haven't for so long..  Tommorrow is Bar Golf and I plan on winning so there should be some kind of good stories from that.. If i remember it...  I'll have two steak sandwhiches and a bloody mary, put it on the Underhill acount..
