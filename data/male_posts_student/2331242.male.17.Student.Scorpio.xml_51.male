Given, those are huge, nay, monstrous reasons to fear the end of this year and then the next, but my dear sweet mother is convincing me more every single day that I don't belong in this house. Infact, I think she wants me to get the fuck out as soon as possible.   Tonight, she came in and picked a fight with me bc I hadn't signed up for my AP exams. I told her I just found out about them, as she had requested, today. She then began to tell me how stupid I was for waiting this late. Then she noticed I was playing video games. She told me she wasn't going to let me play them all night. I said fine, but I would like to go over to Martha's house just to hang out for a while, seeing as it was a  no homework night.  She said no, I wasn't allowed to go on dates during the weekdays. I told her that it wasn't a date, it was just hanging out. Defeated, she resorted to her usual god-damn-motherfucking-moronic-stubborn-headed argument of "I'm the parent.... so.... no!" It pisses me off so bad. Every time I whoop her ass with my kung fu lawyer-like argument skills, she resorts to the same thing over and over again. Then she started to rail on my grades again. I told her my math was a 79.4, and that the comment totally misrepresented my efforts in that class. She wouldn't listen. I told her that the C+ on my report card was really a B- in Biotech. I told her that I was working my ass off in that class, and that I had just let one lab slip. She didn't believe me. I told her that my GPA was a 3.7, and that the only reason she had to be mad at me was English. She wouldn't listen. Then she took my car keys and my cell phone away.  Well now that I can talk to Martha (it's after nine, wouldn't want to run up the cell phone bill) I'll stop fuming. Good night.
