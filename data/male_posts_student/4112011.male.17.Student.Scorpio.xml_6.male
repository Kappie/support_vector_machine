JANET JACOB....  hmm..  teth.. i dont know. i gues im just so selfish.. i like the thought of owning her and i guess thats just the only reason why i am ever sticking to her. am i sticking or am i just given the title..  *sigh* fuck! i hate life so much. what made me like htis? hate life so much? what made me such a miserable person when i was so ok before. was it the freedom? pero i haad freedom before. was it all the pain.. ive had that before what difference does it make. im suppose to learn good stuff diba.? pero how come its just so natural for me to go to the other side.?  guess thats what makes me so human. shit!  i hate being human. i hate living. i hate breathing every god damn morning! cant i be the kid who dies of cancer? cant i be some one else? cant i be the pretty girl who has everything she ever ask for? can i have a good set of paretns? of friends? of lovers?   cant i live somewhere else? manila? europe? i wana get marriend in rome someday.. that would be good right?  im having a head ache.. i wonder if what im writing is long enough. hmm.. im going to make a rule.. next entry i have to have the proper capitalizations and spelling.   i have to go.
