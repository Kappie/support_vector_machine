So like, don't look at the times because they're probably way off. So yeah. The other day I decided to create a range of characters for a series of cartoons, comics etc. They're called the 'Mr. and Mrs. Something-Or-Other Pants'. Yeah, the idea does partly come from Mr. Men and Sponge-Bob Square-Pants, but mine's gonna be better. Some of the characters I have thought of so far include 'Mr. Kewly Pants', 'Mrs. Nerdy Pants', 'Mr. Horny Pants', 'Mrs. Dykey Pants' and 'Mr. Happy Pants'. I thought of so many more but I left the list at Mandys house. So this is going to rule. I'm going to actually take time to design them all, and they're all gonna have a unique pair of pants (that's the trademark)! So I'll post more info on them when I have it.  Mandy and I are having kinda... rough times lately. Mainly down to me being insensitive about her feelings. I don't deserve her in any way at all, so God knows why I still have her. But from now on I'm going to be a lot more sensitive and a lot less argumentative, less stubborn and just generally less moody. I can't lose her. I couldn't handle it. I dunno what else to type about really. So g'bye.
