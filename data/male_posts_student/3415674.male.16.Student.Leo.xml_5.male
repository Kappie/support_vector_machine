Societies Girl Beautiful but phoney Always sweet talks Cause she’ll die if she gets lonely If she would open her eyes and look around She’d realize That the spotlight wasn’t plugged in at all  Now that you’ve moved up so high Is it hard to look down to where you came? Cause you know the clouds aren’t thick enough To forget who your friends are in this game I believe that you could come back to your senses And take off those worn out headphones Because the music is so repetitious And everyone is calling you to come back home
