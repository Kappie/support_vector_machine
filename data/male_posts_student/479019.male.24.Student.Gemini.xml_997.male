I liked the twist in the end that played off the ambiguities in the original movie. In the original we were left wondering if Marco was brainwashed and Rose was his handler.  I think the movie could have really pushed things if they had included stuff like how the Manchurian Corporation was tied to nations that fund terrorists. In the original movie the Communist Chinese were linked to the Russians.  Now playing:  Faithless  - Weapons of Mass Destruction  I also went out for a few beers with Brandon and Andy last night. It was cool. Sharman couldn't make it though.  ***
