I will be a masters candidate starting in September.  If I weren't getting married in June, I could honestly say that I've never been more excited about anything in my life.  As it stands, I'm really excited.  Finding the perfect companion for myself would tend to trump anything else that could happen and will forever stand as the most exciting thing to ever happen in my life.  So, if anybody reads this and lives in Madison, please inform me of any good grocery stores or movie theatres.  I need this info.
