Schoolwork really stressful lar, no other way to put it. Anyway I shall try and make up for not blogging by putting an extra long post here, like the last one. Today BZ told my tt Gabriel doen't think of me as a fren. Some1 asked hu is Gabriel den BZ answered "Kia Hua's best fren...or he tinks of Gbariel tt way lar. Actually Gabriel doesn't think of Kia Hua as a fren", or something liddat. I doubt I can adequately express how hurtful tt comment was, but I just passed it of like nothing in front of BZ(after all, hes like one of the pple hu I hate the most in sch, AND hes the reason I'm daoing Gab in the first place). But seriously, I felt very sad when I heard tt lor. I only hope BZ is exaggerating. Do you noe how hurtful it is to hear that some1 whom I've alway liked and admired thinks of me tt way? I may have my differences with Gabriel, but beyond that, I've always thot I had a strong bond of friendship with him. Still, this seems to say otherwise...Should I still call Gabriel up? I mean, pride seems like a small thing when a friendship I've alway depended on is at stake. But that also leads me to wonder; was it ever there in the first place? Perhaps all the friendship was actually just a mirage, never there in the first place. The only way I can find that out is by waiting, waiting...What is my friendship with Gabriel based on, if ever it was there in the first place? As much as I hate to admit it, BZ's words have a ring of truth to them. They may not be entirely true, but they are definitely not entirely without basis either. I mean, when I look back on my shared experiences with Gabriel, I can still find meaning in the words he said, wad he did...perhaps it was just a case of me seeing only what I wanted to see. As any1 can see from my typing above, I am a very sentimental and insecure person indeed. Thank God no-one ever will. Still, I cannot take my mind away from Gabriel. This leads me to the question; who is/are my true fren(s)? Timothy Wee? Yes indeed, but then again he is every1's best fren. Bryan? Similar reasoning. Nat Ong? I've had my differences with him, and ya, well, while he is still one of my better frens, he is not That close to me. My brother? There are plenty of things I do not, and cannot confide in him about. Now we come back to Gabriel. Gabriel? So I thought....This is one of the more painful experiences in my life. Imagine, the friend of so many years deserting me...awww, as LY would say. Still, I have my pride to cling to, and I shall not desert it to chase after a friend who might never have been a fren. I shall not desert it, not as my erstwhile friends have deserted me. I can, however, hope that either BZ or Gabriel was exaggerating when they said those words...Btw, Nat Ong fell sick today. Throat infection or something. If he is not better by tomorrow, I might go to his house to visit him...but I have chess training. Haiz...I dunno which to go for! I shd stop being so self pitying though...its honestly quite disgusting to myself, i dunno why I typed tt in the first place...
