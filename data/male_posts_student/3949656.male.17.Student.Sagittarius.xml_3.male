The opposite side shows a distorted version of what should be there,  the front shows a completely alternate universe (These may not be  distinguishable). Holes warp the reality surrounding them, but not always to  a noticable degree. Sometimes they can create impossible rooms within the CW  reality that any passer-by would be hard pushed to miss. EG: A sports hall  that fades to black four meters from the entrance, and is twice as tall/wide  as it should be, with a rip near the center of the resulting room.  Falling through a rip is not an everyday occurance, however there is  normally at least one 'visitor' from another dimension that slipped through  the holes. There are no 'special effects', the faller just appears to pass  through an infinitley-thin hole, dropping out onto the other side (or not,  as the case may be. Holes need not be precicely at ground level)
