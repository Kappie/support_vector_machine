I try to forget her because she seems to be doing absolutely nuthing towards rebuilding a relationship of any kind, and suddenly she thinks I'm doing it just to get attention. Look, I'm sorry that you don't want to be my friend, I've heard that I can be a pretty awesome person when you get to know me...but......WTF?!?!?!?!  Seriously though, what the hell is going on?  She hates me, and she doesn't hate me...then she hates me MORE, then she doesn't hate me, then she hates me again.....my my god god. Either way, today was pretty kool, besides the fact that I think my Japanese teacher STILL hates my guts.  We got to sing with the St. Thomas choir*we being anyone who knows Loch Lomand* and this afternoon I'm at my moms to play board games and DDR with them, but then tonight they're bringing me home because I have a Japanese meeting tomorrow.  I'm gonna go back to my highly uplifting life....Peace.  Spense
