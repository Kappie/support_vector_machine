No more info about me or what I like or what I am doing. People in here just get too damn nosey!!!!! Today totally sucked. I didn't get anything done. I reseached some stuff but thats about it. I know Saturday will be a long day in this room for me. I think I am going to bring my headphones, maybe even a movie. I wont give people a chance to bother me. No common sense. Just mind you own business and everything else will fall in line.
