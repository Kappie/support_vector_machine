If you are sitting down in a crowded coffeeshop ala marketplace, you'd have people squeezing in between occupied chairs to get to their family/friend. If you actually sat down and noticed the faces of the people who gave way..., well, you don't see a happy face. I do not comprehend why can't people EVER be honest and just tell that biatch to STFU if they don't like giving way. Is it because they wanna save face? Or is it caused by society's pressure for you to change?  I personally think it's society. In fact, both questions up there are related to society's pressure. Society is corrupted, and thus it corrupts US along with it!  Please people, be more honest with yourself, and everyone around you. If you don't like it, tell'em to STFU and get the hell outta there. Sure, extreme at best, but you gain honesty. Go sit down somewhere and notice things around you. Most people just don't have time for that. Or break the law and spend the night pondering in prison. That'll help too.  I call upon everyone to help improve mankind, and remove that stint of dishonesty and corruption.
