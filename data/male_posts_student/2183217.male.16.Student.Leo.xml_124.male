I told myself this because I woke up at 6pm today. Even though I managed to make plans with Stoney, I still missed out on a lot of free time. I told myself I would go to bed, wake up, have a big breakfast then maybe look for a job. I'm telling myself now that it's 5:17am.  See you all at suppertime.
