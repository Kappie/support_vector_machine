I originally planned to change it to Thursday instead, to drop her guards and do a proper scare on Thursday. However, the fates (8 Days Horoscope) informed me that Thursday is a bad choice, because Piceans will fall out will their friends areound end of the week. So there are no changes. Hmm! Me and Janet planned another strategy for tomorrow use! Heh Heh!  Right. Okay. We were almost late for Physics. Luckily we were not. Sigh. Paper 1 sucks. Tricky questions. 1/3 of the questions were done by guessing. Rather, logical guessing. Oh well. Sigh.  Paper 2 ain't that much better. Short questions kinda sucks. The long questions ain't better either. Sigh. Fail le la. I only know the forces question. That I am confident of scoring. Only. Pathetic.   Okay. Went home. I am planning to study Gas Law later. Then tomorrow I would have only Chem Bonding to study. Yeah. And there's another fic waiting for me. Sigh. Not slash this time though. Yeah.  I think I go study Gas Law. See ya next time! Oh yes! There's cause for celebration tomorrow! YAY! Even ducks and cats are meowing and celebrating the end of exams! Wee-woo! Right. TaTa! Night blog!
