    
       Wednesday, May 19th, I will be having a little mini-party for the series finale of "Angel".  Don't worry about not knowing what's going on, because you will be in the majority.  The show is at 9:00, but you should probably arrive earlier than that so we can get all settled in. I will be coming home from class at 8:00, so show up sometime between 8:10ish and 9ish. Okay. Yay!
