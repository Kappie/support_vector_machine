When your body’s torn up, it’s torn up.  This time, however, it’s going to be even more fun because I’ve somehow aggravated the previous ankle injury to the point of needing surgery again. Whatever he fixed the first time is coming loose, causing laxity in there again…and that ain’t good, kiddos.  My problem seems to be  urlLink Enthesopathy , which is apparently an abnormality of tendon-bone attachments. To be specific – the tendon-bone attachment that he surgically repaired a year and a half ago is (for some reason) become loose. That's great because that problem's throwing the whole ankle off kilter, subsequently pissing everything else in there off and causing it to hurt like hell most of the time.  He doesn’t “advocate” surgery right now; instead, he put me in this  urlLink god-awful air-cast boot thing  that vaguely resembles a ski boot or the boot of a space alien. This boot, however, is much less cool than either of those...and it has to be much less comfortable.  Anyway, that’s probably enough about my painfully depressing orthopedic problems.  No one was at work yesterday, so I've been all by my lonesome thus far. It breaks my heart, lemme tell ya. I do have a lot of free time again today, so I’ve been perusing the Net to kill time. Between that and the country music that I have playing on the radio, the time's just  flying  by.  The JibJab guys now offer shirts and other goodies with their "This Land is Your Land" hilarity on them. They even have their own  urlLink online store .  The only problem is that I can't decide which shirt I want --  urlLink this one  or perhaps  urlLink this one . Maybe both if the paycheck is good enough next week. But it won't be.  There are also lots of funny shirts at  urlLink ebaynham.com  (Thanks,  urlLink LawDawg , for that one. It was a banner in the email you sent last week).  Yes, I am THAT bored.
