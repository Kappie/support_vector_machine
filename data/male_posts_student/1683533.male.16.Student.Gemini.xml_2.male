Jack Nicholson is a great actor....it is an older movie but it was still amazing...it's about this guy in jail that gets put in an asylum even though he isnt that insane....it was good i recommend that you see it...go rent it now...  lol I just had like a break-down....I got pissed over something....I forget what....and I started hurting and crying....that's never really happened to me...i just got really flustered....ugh...that wasn't fun....crying over nothing....i was actually doing pretty good...i was very happy lately....i guess i was just overdue for some depression....but why should i be depressed lol.....am i supposed to be depressed or something..?
