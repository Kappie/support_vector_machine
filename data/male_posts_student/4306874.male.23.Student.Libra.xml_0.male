Great... now I live better. Knowing that some crazy-ass Mohammed is "innevitably" going to nuke my hometown (maybe...).  As if people aren't scared enough with bio-terrorism and chemical warfare (and the ever-fashionable car-bombs and waist-bombs), now we're told that, like in a lottery, some of us will be nuked to oblivion within the next ten years. Maybe you. Maybe me. Maybe all of us.  Who cares? Que sera, sera. If a madman with a tourbant nukes my backyard, chances are I'll never even know what happened until S.Peter coughs in the gates of Heaven to get my attention away from the Gameboy Advance.  Still, it supports that which I believe in: The world is racing towards it's now-officially-confirmed inevitable doom, and surprise, religious extremism is behind it all. If there's a God somewhere, I'm sure She's really pleased with us.  That reminds me, I've read an interesting article where it says nuclear weaponry are probably "soul-killers". Let me explain: If souls exist, they must be a form of energy. Even people talk about positive and negative charges, or whatever.  But a nuclear detonation disrupts every form of energy within its blast radius.  So that's a nice thought. Unless God upgrades the Soul System to a non-disruptible form, when you die, you go to Heaven... provided you weren't nuked. Then it's just curtains and the eternal darkness of non-existence, I'm afraid (is non-existence black? Does black exist in non-existence?).  You know you've evolved as a race when you can kill people even after they're already dead.  Bless us, every one of us.
