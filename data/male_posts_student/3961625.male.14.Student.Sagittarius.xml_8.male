I've been traveling with eleven other people, nine of whom have lost their luggage!  Blame American Airlines for that one...  Last night I hosted eight people for dinner at the hotel's restuarant and all (even those who'd be determinedly living on beer and pretzels for the last two days) seemed to enjoy it.  India makes a very good light beer, called Kingfisher, which might have helped :-)  In trying to send you all a picture I've just discovered that my pictures are all corrupt -- blasted computers!  I think the internal card in the camera is less than right.  We will see...  My plans now are to be up and about, getting people towards a 3 p.m. meeting with the first company we are visiting.  Love to all!
