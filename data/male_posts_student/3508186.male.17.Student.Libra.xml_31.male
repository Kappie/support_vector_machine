It's gonna be bad ass.  Last year, and the 2 before that we started shooting stuff off at 5 or 6 and didnt get done til midnight.  We also get to eat tons of food: hotdogs, hamburgers, potatoe salad, etc.  I've never brought anyone before so this is gonna be real fun.  Last night Josh, Sean and I made some sparkler bombs and blew up a refridgerator.  The bombs were so loud you could hear em so far away.  You could even feel the shock wave!  Well, I gotta go.  Peace out.
