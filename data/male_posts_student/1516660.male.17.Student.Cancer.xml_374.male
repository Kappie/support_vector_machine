Even the birds are chirping and the sun is shining and the cats are meowing downstairs. Actually, there are no cats downstairs, and I didn't hear any birds chirping, and the sun isn't really bright at 7.45am. I am crapping.  Yes. I met Gloria and HL at the 911 busstop. They are wearing red and grey respectively. We were early. CQ came shortly after, wearing red. PY and SQ then arrived, wearing dunnoe-what-color and white respectively. Joyce then arrived, wearing grey.   Yes! We waited around and around for the basketball court to empty. Well, half of it anyway. It never did. We sat around waiting for KS, He told us to go play first, he will join us later. Yeah. We then went to the court with less shade and more sun!   We bade farewell to PY halfway and continued our tiring trek towards the court. We always end up there de. We played some ball. What a meowing and mooing game. KS soon joined us. We play more games.   Hmm. After that, we went to Causeway Point. CQ and Joyce went off to go home and eat. HL went off later to go meet with her PW group. Left me, Gloria, SQ and KS. We went up to the foodcourt to meet up with Hann and XC.   We ate lunch la. Me and Gloria ate duck porridge again. I ate popiah also. What a meowing choice of food!  After that, we went popiah. Me and Gloria just walked around while the guys were playing this and that. Ayiah,..after going to the arcade, Hann left.   The 4 of us decided to go play pool. Joyce joined us soon after. We played for 2 hours. Hmm. Meow! After that, we went home. Me and Gloria took 913 bus home. Yes! Even ducks are meowing.   I reached home, took a bath, played PoA, ate dinner and here I am online.  Ayioh! I feel so guilty! I didn't study for my exams at all, and not even touched my homework. I guess I better start on Monday. Sigh.   Well, I gotta go! Even ducks will do well to remember 18. Yes. See ya. TaTa! Night blog!
