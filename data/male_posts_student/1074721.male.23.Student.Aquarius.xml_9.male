Got something to do ...... i have to go to Calcutta if IIM-B waitlist does not turn up in my favour and deposit my fees there. So 3 days out of the way there :) then a couple of days to Varanasi to get my certi's attested along with maybe a trip to Delhi.   I finished up Halo today, good game ... great storyline, have a feeling Halo 2 will be even greater. Loved the vehicles that u can drive in the game, a real novelty.    Thats all .. rest later :)
