I had a lot of fun hanging out with friends and seeing people I haven't seen since high school. It was great, but I didn't get any work done for school.  I still don't feel like I have any energy. I haven't felt like this since I was in high school cutting weight for wrestling. I think I need to take some more vitamin supplements and consume more carbohydrates. Things really hit rock bottom recently and now is not a good time for it to do so. I missed work today because I just felt too weak to get out the door. I showered and could barely stand up in there.  Something good that's happened is getting the  Process of Belief  b-side "Shattered Faith." As it always seems to be the case, the lyrics on that album is pretty fitting for what's going on right now. Regardless of that, the song is awesome. I really need to get the import of the album so I can really own that song!  ***
