CARTON MILK  versus  PLASTIC JUG MILK     POINT: CARTON MILK      To begin, I’d like to thank Jimtopia for the opportunity to make my views heard. Here and now, I will erase any preconceived notions you had about milk from a carton by convincing you of its many benefits. While I agree with my opponent on the subject of milk itself, where we differ is on the delivery… All property relations in the past have continually been... He seems to think that a plastic jug provides a more efficient conveyance for the dairy, and this is simply not the case.  1 -  Storage.  Carton milk, with its standard rectangular prism shape, is perfect for stacking and storage without hassle. Plastic Jug milk, however, has rounded edges, and when combined with sweating (see point 3) makes for a very unstable milk-stacking structure.  It’s time to leave the stone age of milk conveyance!  Join the exodus unto the future of that white, gland-fresh substance we call milk.    2 -  Rigidity.  The pyramidal hood on all Carton milk gives it a rigidity of form that simply cannot be had from the malleable plastic material of Plastic Jug milk.  3 -  Condensation and Absorbency.  The state-of-the-art hybrid paper/cardboard/wax alloy of which Carton milk is made provides maximum absorbency of condensation, giving you, the drinker, a firmer grip on your milk conveyance. Plastic Jug milk condensation simply gathers on the outside, making a mess and a slippery situation.  There’s plenty to cry over when your spilled milk accidentally trips up a loved one.    4 -  Ease of Use.  Simply put, Carton milk utilizes what people in my profession like to call "Immediate Drinkability," or "Buy 'n Drink." It helps move milk, as a drink, out of the past and into the 21st Century; thus, moving the beverage down the consumer’s esophagus, and, eventually, back into the 21st Century once more. Its easy to use lid allows the drinker to swallow his or her milk most effectively.  As opposed to the archaic and obsolete design of Plastic Jug milk, the carton of milk’s “lidless” lid follows closely the Euclidean derivation of a 36-degree angle (accept no substitutes!).  Would you really want to drink something out of anything but a golden ratio?   The four points above, along with many more that have not been published here (environmental factors, ease of production, and cost of materials), should sway you and your buying decisions toward Carton milk – the Superlative Milk Conveyance of the 21st Century!   COUNTER-POINT - PLASTIC JUG MILK      That absurdly gracious, “carton-milk introduction” aside (an obvious ploy), I believe that it is time that the American people experience the truth.  For only then can any real, positive change be affected in the fight against the red and white, pasteurized specter that is Carton milk.    Carton milk is an obvious tool of the Communist and is a mere trifle in its eventual goal of the total and complete enslavement of the proud American people. Pay no heed to the traitorous lies you see above you, for they contain many subliminal messages inserted by the Stalinist lords of Carton milk. The obvious red color scheme of Carton milk clearly displays its roots in Godless Communism, along with its mind-warping "images" and “designs,” so obviously designed to purposefully cloud the senses and rational thought, leaving the viewer unaware of the twisted mental and ideological messages being inserted into his or her mind. The material from which Carton milk is made does not originate from America or even America's Heartland, Mexico. Nay, it is produced in foreign nations—that’s right: Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea, China! I am willing to forgive this fact, that Carton milk originates in the vast, evil region, because many goods we all use do, and that’s OK, because most goods are not insidious threats to our God-loving society. However, it is obvious to anyone with the will to overcome the evil, medusa-like tendrils of Carton milk already influencing and warping our society, that with the production of Carton-paper in these countries will eventually lead to the collapse of the proud capitalist tradition of the US, leaving it wide open for Communist overthrow. Finally, the chemical lacing on every carton of Carton milk is a godless cocktail of drugs designed to leave the mind open for ideological conversion to Communism, along with radioactive markers so that you can be tracked from outer space (if this purported "outer space" exists, and is not another Marxist myth).  Remember: Every time you buy Carton milk, it's like punching an American baby in the stomach and setting his or her toys on fire.
