Most of which was fun. Playing squash and badminton and whatever. But oh crap. Nat managed to completely ruin my plan by not turning up afterwards. BAH!   And again I had a very interesting discussion with Holly, mostly about Nat.   Soon I'll post my Western conference lineup. Oh, and theres the small matter of there only being 5 days of school left. Woohoo.
