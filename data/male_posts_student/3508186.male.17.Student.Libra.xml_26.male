I pretended to be Kassandra and invited him over. When he came and knocked onthe door she grabbed him and I came up behind him saying, "ohh baby ohh baby." It was great. Then we sat around there talking for a few hours. It sounds boring, but ya know, I like to make people laugh and I love to talk so it's always fun for me. I think Josh likes Kassandra some but I asked her and she said onlyliked himas a friend. Well, I did ask her if I could trust her when she was hangin out with Jon and look what happened. This time Ibelieve her though. Plus Josh is really hitting it off with a girl from Muskogee.We met her at the Gameroom therea few weeks back. She seems cool.Well Itold myself that I wouldnt wanna go back out withKassandra after what she did but now I see her again and I want her back. I know it shouldnt happen but how am I gonna fight myself. Anyhow, she still wants Jon back and I guess I cant change people so I'll let things go by themselves. Well, this post is nearing an end......yeah, right now.
