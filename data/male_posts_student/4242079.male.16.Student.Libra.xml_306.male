I am bored with my job, and I am bored with existence in general.  The other day, I was in HMV, squandering more money on DVDs and CDs. I got to talking to HMV-girl. We went to the same school for one semester, and talked around the fire one night at a punk show. She was telling me about the one act she's working on right now, and I told her to let me know when the performance would be. She said she would, and proceeded to ask me if I was still into photography. Now, I was never  really  into photography, but I guess it was enough for her to remember me for that. I told her that I never had time for anything like that anymore. So. Today, I am going to put on my hat, get in my car, put gas in my car, and go to take some pictures. No theme, no "artistic message". Just pictures.
