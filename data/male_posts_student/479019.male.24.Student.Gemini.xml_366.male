I mean, I've always they were cool... but it's like my appreciation for them grows with each listen.  My plan is to get on the 2:20 bus to campus and get some reading done. Then I'll come home around 6-ish. Eat and call some friends up to see if they want to see WM. If they don't want to, then it's  American Psycho  tonight.  ***
