OI! OI!  -  ::looks around::  Did they score a goal or something?  -  Yeah, sorry about the long delay of posts.  I had to wait for interesting things to accumulate.  That, and I'm lazy.  -  94.7 finally got good again.  -  I was getting some sexy shades at G.I.Joes, and I found out Erin works there.  To Erin:  I saw your car.  It is hot.  -  I went to McDonalds for breakfast this morning, and I go in there after the rush, and it was completely filled with "old people!"  I exlaimed.  Out loud.  -  Stairway to Heaven gets hard when you attempt to play it correctly.  -  When McGillivray was getting sealed up, people were stuck in their homes.  I went to my grandparents' house (on McGillivray) and visited for awhile (Early in the morning).  They kept wanting me to help out with stuff, and I came to the slow relalization that they were attempting to trap me with them.  Crafty old people.  -  Those damn SNEAKER PIMPS!  -  Car's battery cable was loose.  I was scared I ran the battery dead.  -  I cry to everyone:  GET ME OUT OF THE HOUSE!!  -  My cousin's wedding tomorrow.  I am so excited!  I love weddings!  And remember, I like GIRLS.  Please try to remember that.  -  I watched bunches of movies.  Donnie Darko - Very enjoyable, however it is hard to decipher without the website.  Regardless, it makes you think.  Full Metal Jacket - My favourite Stanley Kubrick film now.  Very, very intense.  Bubba Ho-Tep - Woo-hoo!  25th Hour - Need to re-watch, kind of drifted off during it.  Mystic River - Better than I expected.  Worth seeing.  Open Range - Good western.  Good, good.  The Doors - Long, but tolerable.  True Romance - Brad Pitt has a very convincing stoner role in that.  Saving Private Ryan - I will never tire of this movie.  The Professional - Hehe.......  Taxi Driver - Damn...  -  I finally got a chance to play through Call of Duty.  Now THERE is an intense game.  Holy crap.  -  I'm watching this infomercial about Ronco Knives.  I have seen it four times.  I am praying something will be different and the old guy will cut his finger off.   Yep, that's what it's getting to now, folks.  -  !!!  I was able to go over to Felix's house and not throw up!  Maybe those days are over!  -  Can you believe Rick James is gone?  Damn.  I hope nobody does the Chapelle impression of him at the funeral.  Damn.  -  Why the HELL do I enjoy Maroon 5?!  I SHOULDN'T, but I do!!  ::weeps::  -  Ice-cream is the fixer of any bad emotion.  It's truely amazing.  -  I still can't drive my 5-speed.  Still!  Christ!  -  I've been putting in applications everywhere.  Now let's hope Brian get's a job!  -  To Brionna:  Why do you enjoy TORTURING me so much!?  One day, I'm going to get you back.  -  Jason and I have had this parody RPG in the works for what, two years?  We keep forgetting about it.  We've now decided to ditch RPG toolkit, and turn it into a picture book.  You will be amazed by the vocal stylings of DJ Krackley.
