If you weren't Poet Laureate of the Blog, I'd so absolutely kill you right now, it's not even funny. Also, you forgot Rachel in your Blog celebration, which also isn't funny.  I gave my anti-PE speech today, and it was absolutely disasterous. I didn't get 30 seconds into the speech before every person in that room was looking at me like "Oh my God, what is that crazy [white] boy thinking?". I just had not cards so a lot of the eloquency got lost in translation and I just stumbled through a my outline. It was awful. I have one word for Hall.  urlLink Tele-Prompter . Actually that's two words joined with a hyphen. My bad.  You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.
