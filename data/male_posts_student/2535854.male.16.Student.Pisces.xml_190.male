First thing almost when I got there, met Chen and she told me Idzmil and all were downstairs at the canteen having dinner..So I went down there and met them! Sat across Zai and Iqah and Chris Wong, Nick Wong, Adrian Voon, Afandi, Lingesht and Idzmil were also at the table and then we got up and went to get dinner at the place..not much in the choice of food...it was obviously catered food..was okalh..not bad actually to say...I had that nasi briyani I think with ayam masak merah I think..haha and some fish..didn`t touch the caramel dessert which everyone else did and said NOT to take it..haha..After retreiving my camera which was abducted by Zainul, me and Idzmil went to the hall...he was actually there to go find chicks and stuff...bloody hash-him! *sneezed* haha...  And then outside the hall they had these really cool small tv screen on those stands they use for speeches...in fact they have water dispensers on the bottom, but they didn`t put any water to give and stuff...and plus cups would be a problem anyway :p ...So on the tv screen,they put the names of those who were getting awards and stuff..and for Handball, Idzmil`s name was put as  Adzmi Hashim ... AHAHAHAHAH!!!!! What made it funnier was that he received School Colours Awards but nobody told him! ahaha! So didn`t go in the morning to collect them at the smaller award ceremony whichw as at like 8 or 9am...nyeh nyeh!  So we went looking for seats upstairs...cause like..sitting downstairs you can`t see any shit for nuts..so we went upstairs..wanted to sit at the very back row at the top..but got shooed off by JY who sai that place is for prefects and crap..mother...Idzmil wanted to around there cause of err 'certain someone' was sitting nearby..haha..So anyway on the left side of the upper deck (in a way) or upper level of the hall, was emtpy spots...so grabbed chairs and sat there with Zainul and Haziqah( their names need to be said in that way)..,Idzmil, Farah .D, and dunno la form 1 fellas whose name`s remain a mystery that Im not interesting in solving to me...And Jamal was up and down but mainly sat there..for much longer period of times.. The seats were the best in the house I say..but...it was in front of all those air-con vents...yeah..they are huge..so it was so cold...wearing blazer and rolled down long sleeves doesn`t help all too much..haha..!But it was damn nice and windy and stuff...so no chance anyone who sat there would complain about to little air or oxygen there...haha...although I do agree with Jamal a bit that it seemed like the air was being sucked up and crap..So anyway had to grab some chairs and stuff...haha..just grabbed some when nobody was looking..hehe..  Well after about waiting for an ice age, eating Haziqah`s snack and stuff...the show finally began which had some opening speeches and the teachers all ushered in wearing graduation robes and stuff to show apprieciation to them and stuff....the teacher who got the biggest roar was Ms Tok who wears only a few different dresses a year and stuff...but tonight she was wearing a spaghetti strap and had make up and glitter and sparkling stuff all over her..whole place errupted...aheheh..Pn Nora also had alot of cheers...  So then Cheryl sang the school song..and now I know why she`s in YKLS and stuff...she`s quite good..And then they gave out special awards for people who`s name`s will go into a book which makes them a true Cempakan for life and stuff cause they`ve made the school proud and stuff...they stand on stage...someone of their choice will read out a short speech about them and their acheivement`s, rank,posts, awards and stuff with curicular and studious stuff...and the projector will show their name and picture...and wow..me and Jamal were thinking and talking...what an honour it is for your name to be inside there...its something thats once in a lifetime..something that`s deserved..something that you work so hard for...its a privilage that not many can and ever will get as a student in their schooling days and stuff people get..Its a thing that you can cherish for the rest of your life...and for them..they will...in that book..wow...sigh..I doubt my name will ever enter it...but most people who`s name`s got isndie have been with the school while they were 1st grade or slightly older..damn damn damn..they have quite a few categories and things, special awards..but well...not easy to be there..its like a club only for those privilaged...a lifetime membership..but something that money doesn`t buy..its the ahrd work put in and made possable by the money paid and stuff for it..all I can say is...wow...  Then the shows started while they were preparing for the main attraction..yikes..all those fellas who booked tables got to eat dinner then and they had nice food and stuff...damn jealous..next year, we have vowed to  book a table  an toast away! And laugh at everyone else! Haha..its only rm500 for a table so rm50 a person with 10 seats at the table would do just nicely..Then we can waylay who else didn`t have get a table and stuff..!And jeesh! There were emtpy tables..if coulda bought them at that time anyway..hahahahahaha..  Anyway them weird Cheras ppl peformed 1 dance..which was quite good..1 guy did that baksetball thingy around the inside ur shirt..damn..he must be into street..Cheryl and Sarah with Sue Ann at the piano sang and danced to 'All that Jazz'..Kent and I think Jinn Cheok and Kah Hon played 'Penny and me'..David,John and err Brandon played 'Valentine' I think..then Shen Jin fella played something as well..there was someother dances and songs as well...quite nice actually..eheh..then came the main show!  It was 'Wizard of Oz'. It started off with Dorothy (played by Anastacia) in her home which was in Kansas and there was a tornado..she had left her hosue but went back in as she left something but she was to late and she blacks out..heh...and then she wakes up in a different land...and is found by I the soceress or Witch of East or West? Err whatever it is played by Andrea who looked hot in that white dress and with that make up on..heheh..and her voice was very fairy godmother like..haha..and she ( Dorothy) was told that Oz (who was played by Hui Jien) had the power to grant wishes and could b ring her back...and btw she was in Munchkin Land..with all those weirdly dressed up 'short' haha...people who were all friendly and dacing and singing and all...ahaha..And sometime soon I belive Dorothy sang err what was it..err...ah! Somewhere over the Rainbow.. Anyway on the way looking for Oz, she encountered a The Scarecrow (played by Nicholas Tan) who was stuck to a pole and suppsoe to scare away crows obviosuly from the fields...but it wasn`t working and he was wishing he had a brain..haha! Well Dorothy then freed him but he had trouble talking and stuff...ahaha...So after being told of what Oz could do for him, he followed Dorothy..and before that The Scarecrow sang some song and stuff.aheheh.. Then I think the next guy they encountered was The Tin Can Man (played by Nigel Ang)..who has well..'rusty parts'...and he then proclaimed he needed a heart...and they made him fixed up somewhat by 'spraying WD40' on him..lmao..and then he sang 'What if I had a heart' changing the lyrics of 'What a Wonderful world' around...AHAHA!!.I like the way he spoke throughout the show and his super shiny silver costume...damn chunted... The the next fella they met (after being told by the Munchkins and crap and the soceress that they had to go through the forest which was full of bears) was the lion...in the forest of course...but the lion (played by Shazzy) was some coward..he only ruled the jungle cause the bears were afraid of his site..but he claimed he was fearing the day that the bears may no longe rbe afraid of him as he had no 'courage'..hahahahaha..and he sang some song about that crap...and yes he followed them to see Oz but eachtime they encountered soemthing new, he tried to err chicken out but they kept pulling him back and yes..he was gonna ask for courage.aehheh.. So err what happened...aha...they err met some ppl la whoever they were and stuff...err aha!Gloria who was played by Cheryl and her dad and stuff who was oddly played by Farah Zuleika...haha..weird..so err whatever it is soon they were on their way to see Oz but were warned not to make them angry..and btw Jackshen..played a..butler!haha!Or was a waiter!WHo cares!haha! Oh yeah the Witch..played by Azra...was the best man..her voice and her laughs were spectacular!Haha..jamal was laughing to death....and she had planned to kill Dorothy although I think Dorothy had some spell but on her by thes soceress so that she couldn`t be harmed..?Err btw during that time was horrendous...dont look left!Bloody hell Zainul and Haziqah 2 much..make out..Idzmil said he saw them frenching..who cares..I dont care abt what I dont see...but fuck you could her the sound effects!Fucker!*MUAH MUAH* yuck! And in the meantime the witch caught Dorothy and Tibia her assistant played by werr Chong Ian were like trying to cook her in a big pot!? like soem sacrifice thing..and haha...the 2 witches (Sarah and Constance) were aguing abt whos better and stuff..and haha..the role Constance was complaining to me abt..she had to flirt with Chong Ian..ahaha..and she was trying to 'take him home' ahahaha..so soon anyway after having some pain from his head, the scarecrow and co found Dorothy and killed the witch and stuff....oh before that they had a skeleton dance..with like all the lights turned off and stuff...and like 15 or 20 ppl dressed in the skeleton suits that glow blue in the dark started dancing to Eminem`s 'The Real Slim Shady'...damn chun..ahaha...   Oh yeah met Oz earlier and he said he`d grant his wishes if they killed the witch and they did anyway so they came back for their wishes...he said he couldnt grant them..then the Lion just all off a sudden rammed into a wall and Oz was revealed as some guy who looks like a waiter or a Butler..haha...he said their wishes didnt need to be granted cause they had all shown all the wishes they wnated by showing courage, a heart, brains...while Dorothy couldn`t et home..but all of a Sudden she was back home in Kansas and thus endth the story..  So after that lepak outside with every1...Afandi and all went back as they were spending the night at his place in Kenny Hills,so met with some ppl and bla..met Allyna out there..then Sarah and like Farah who was looking for her and stuff...then met Cheryl who had all that giesha like make up on her and they all went back with Yu Shen except Sarah and Farah whos parents were there...then talked to Jason (Soh) after calling my parents...and he was like...despite attending Commencents year after year, he still never learns and is one of the last few ppl there..and he was! But soon his ride came! And I called my ride earlier and he only lives a few streets away! Bugger..then I was truly one of the last few ppl there...then finally by ride came...good lord!haha..  Well anyway..it was quite good!
