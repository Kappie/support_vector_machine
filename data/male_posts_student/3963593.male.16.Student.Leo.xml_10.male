I dont think I'm fat enough to wear one of these shirts, but I still think its a great idea.  Fat people are always funny, and I can say this because I am fat (not obese, but overweight, but I'm mostly muscle, well, kind of, just drop it).  Although many may say that anorexia isn't a problem to joke about, I think and act for myself, and I say it's a great and easy topic to poke fun at.  If you are offended by this because you are an Olsen twins fanatic, go away, I don't want anyone who takes things too seriously reading this any way.  Until next time, I have nothing to say. urlLink
