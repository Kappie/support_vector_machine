This project was codenamed 'Marklar' and currently employs about a dozen fulltime Apple programmers. Consider this Apple's backup plan should the PowerPC fail to keep up with Intel / AMD microprocessors. Of course Apple doesn't admit that the 'Marklar' program even exists, but I've heard differently.  Anyhow... enough with the Apple history channel today I stumbled across a PowerPC emulator for Linux  Windows by the name of PearPC. I've heard of things like this in the past, but this time I was told people are successfully running OS X inside of Windows. And let me tell you it works, Now don't get too stoked yet, there are some problems as this is the 0.1 release... in other words, alpha at best.  Here are the details you need to know: - It's slow, very very slow  as in 286 SX slow, as in iTunes for Windows slow... you get the idea. - Certain machines work, others don't. From what I've seen in the forums it's about a 50/50 shot it will work on your PC. - You must own OS X - Lots of bugs.. think of it as a proof of concept for the time being.  All that being said  If your like me, you'll want to install it anyways. So follow these instructions exactly: (down and dirty instructions  I recommend this as a   urlLink prerequisite )  1. Download  urlLink PearPC-JITC  and extract it to c:\pearpc 2. Download and install  urlLink Alcohol 120%  3. Download the  urlLink Darwin PPC .ISO  and save it to c:\pearpc 4. Download these configuration files and save them to c:\pearpc   urlLink File 1 ,  urlLink File 2  5. Download and extract  urlLink this file  to c:\pearpc (takes some time to extract as this is the 6GB hard drive image  use WinRAR)  6. Now use Alcohol 120% to create an ISO image of OSX 10.3 disk 1. Name it osx.iso and save it to your c:\pearpc directory 7. Follow  urlLink these instructions  and partition the new 6GB virtual drive  (from a command prompt run 'ppc ppccfg.darwin') - no need to install darwin. 8. Now run 'ppc ppccfg.osx' from the command prompt  Step 8 will boot you into the OS X installation  install and enjoy... As you will see in the forum links below, everyone is having different results. Remember, it takes awhile and it's not uncommon to freeze for a few mins. Use F12 to enable the mouse and move it around from time to time. Doesn't really do anything.. but it makes me feel better that it's not locked up.
