I'm not sure if anyone has noticed, but I am a pretty avid LP fanatic as i began to sing out loud, everyone crowded around me and THAT really kicked ass. for the next few songs it was pretty calm around the whole place. that is, until the final 2 songs came around, as the DJ anounced that " these are going to be you're last songs for you're 8th grade year, make em good."  with that saidthe whole place went up in tears * sigh*as we went into the last slow dance .... i was approched by several of my close gurlfriendzz , they were apperantly looking for a shoulder to cry on ........ so there i was with about 10 gurls cryin around me as i tried my best to comfort them all. the end of the dance wwas pretty crappy. we did get this kewl pin that says " class of sutter 03' " so i guess that was kewl. Im gonna wear it on my graduation dress * lollz* . but yeah ...... ima wear it , so at least i can say that i once had school spirit. well , im going to go sob and cry and be depressed now ................
