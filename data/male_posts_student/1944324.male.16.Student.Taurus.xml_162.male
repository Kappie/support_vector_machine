(Come to think of it, I didn't see her after the play with the rest of the Dollingers.)  If the latter is the case, and you all say "Lara Who!?!" then the answer is "Never mind, she doesn't exist here." Anyway, We made Grand Nats Semis.  Unfortunately, we have the first draw and must be at school at 5:00, so I think I'm going to bed.  A few select messages tonight, with no bolding. Soph: Michael's already the funniest, so soon after the extravaganza!?! Jeez! Michael:  Thomas has the best title scheme ever.  Don't be dissin it. Thomas: When you're living in a DOOM HOUSE at the end of the millenium, You're what you own.  Discuss.  Yar! This Be a Superball!... Or Be it!?!?     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?... Or Is It? Dum dum dum
