Sellin' Dope (Wolves doesn't count)  I woke up to hear "Mind Sex" this morning, and despite the fact most people say it is one of DP's weak points on "Lets Get Free" it's one of my favorite songs from it.  It really has a deep spiritual feeling to it, that although Dead Prez is Atheist, refreshes my soul just to hear.    "It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet We can burn the incense, and just chat Relax, I got the good vibrations Before we make love let's have a good conversation"  The Chorus makes them seem sorta soft, but the song is really good, and the Poem from the LP guy makes me wanna cry because he says it so well, that I gotta listen to it at least twice every night.  "She smiles, I smile She walks, no she glides softly by me changing night into day She opens her mouth to speak, and so sounds ring in my head She speaks, and i want to dance to her rhythm She moves ever so gently, increasing my desires,  As i place my arms around her waist,  Hold and squeeze unto me, I want to melt into her body, and discover the base of her warmth Her beautiful black body that, no human mind could ever conceive She's love She's truth She's real, as real as the stars that shine in the heavens As real as the sun that bathes her body, As real as the moon that glows and the birds that sing and the rose That blossoms in spring for she is that rose And not just any rose, But a black rose, Black rose stands tall and stronger than any other plant A black rose, that stands as creator, of nations of Black rose That never loses her petals, and blossoms all year round Black rose, Sweet rose, Thornless rose Eternal rose Please look my way, Please look my way Please look my way Black rose"  Oh man.  Now this set the tone for my day with all the Negro-ness.  Case in point being history.  I'm extremely torn on the video we are doing.  How are we going to handle it?  Maybe I don't want to touch an issue I've never talked about with non-black people, but it really seems strange.   I don't know what exactly to think about it, because my mind was further broken because as I was talking to the group the words "Jah" came into my mind, even the letters.  The thought was extremely strong, and it really broke my concentration for awhile.  I'm a weird ass.  Then after school I had that damn Spanish video project.  I pray that gets done tommorow.
