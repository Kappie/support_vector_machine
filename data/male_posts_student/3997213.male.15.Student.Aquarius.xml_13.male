Though the book itself doesn't have much relevance to our life, I think the title does. Normal chaos. That's the way it was around here today when Rachel came back. It was like all of a sudden the house grew louder and tension mounted. Rachel and Reid started it but like I said, it's normal. They had arguments over the Sims and for some reason it seemed to affect the whole house. I noticed it today on the way home from visiting Nana in the hospital. Rachel and Reid fight in the fan and it makes everyone else edgy. Know what I mean? It was like a dark cloud that once it affected one area, it spread and hit everyone else...except me that is. I sat back and kept my cool, staying out of stuff as best as possible. When we got home, I headed out the backdoor and got away from it all until Reid followed me. I think the fresh air did wonders for everyone because the tension went down from there. That is until it was time for dinner. I don't need to go into detail here though. It was a normal dinner. It was the absolutely normal chaos dinner that we all have grown to know and live with.
