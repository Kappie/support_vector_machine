If I don't work hard enough I might fail more.  :'(  Math is the one that's most in danger...  It's all summer and night school for me next year ;_;  I haven't even had the chance to post about me being sick.  Or about Jade's really fun birthday. I didn't even get to read Jade's story yet.  :\ Gomen ne Jade-san.  -_- The network is acting up... So I can't burn or get things to or from my sister's computer and... And...  And Winamp5 is out.  That surprised me.  I learned something yesterday.  So l33t.  (tired) -ArV
