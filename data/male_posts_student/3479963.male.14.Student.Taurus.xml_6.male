This is my first blog I am writing. Lets not dampen the spirit. -.- Actualli i have 1 more acct... but for some reason i forgot the password for my email and user.. thats frustrating. OK.. let me introduce myself.. HMm.. where should I begin? ok.. first of all, I am a boy and my english is horrible, so forgive me if you spot any mistake. LOL! im now in my teens and i do lots of stupid stuff like going to the movies, soccer, basketball, wasting time on television programmes, sendind messages via sms, wasting money on bubbletea and lots more. Those are my interest. Heya.. that should be all...   NOTE " The songs are representing my feelings..."
