[den he will ban mi from drivin.. :( ] after the wonderful lunch, it's time to spend sometime with my fellow shoppin mates.. we will talk abt our hubby's bed performance[opps]..browse the prada, burberry,louis vuitton catalog.. ya.. once in a blue moon, i will pop up in my hubby's office to do spotcheck.. ya.......... this is essential..      it's time to go home.. and i will again, prepare international cuisine for him. i will surely dress in that particular country costume and ya.. jus to eat.. man will like it i bet. cos they are wat visual orientated creature.  den i will show him wat i bout today!! dunno why.. always at that moment he will start shivering and sweat profusely.. ha.. den, we will watch the tv, talk abt current affair..  i tin my future husband will like to test mi like wat PM goh said in the parliment yesterday.. and all those non-of-my-business tin jus to mock mi...     den finally.. light will be shut off.. ya.. and hee.. ho ho ho.. woo la la..     and that's my ideal life.. and i believe i haf found my "him"..
