They had some classic cars, cool; animals, cool; and little kids passing out candy; okay. The candies were warm, but nonetheless, I ate 'em!   Other than that, we had a friend over and played some cards, watched some movies, and just chilled.   I only wish could have gone to San Francisco to buy  illegal  fireworks . . .   . . . oh well.
