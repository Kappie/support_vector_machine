Sometimes I can see his face... he's smiling... not friendly, but not... well... agh, it's hard to explain...  Of course, now that I've written about him, he won't come back. It's the same with all my dreams- if i hope to dream of something, or i recognize a dream, it goes away.  I can't stop thinking about it, though... maybe there WAS a point to Freud's theory.
