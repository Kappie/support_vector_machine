Pretty soon I won't be able to go outside when going from 3rd hour study hall to 4th hour then to lunch!  So that will stink, but I can't say much more about it because there's no changing it!  We still do have winter... Global warming can't be that bad?  I want to quickly mention something before I forget it.  Ever since I last posted my weekend recap, I am proud to say I have not had a single potato chip!  Down with the chips... They are nothing but bad, bad, bad!  I challenge everyone else out there to try cutting one piece of junk food completely out of your diet.  It does a lot.  I have a nice feeling of accomplishment.  Also, I'd like to share a few Googlisms I found on my name.  Obviously "Michael Halbe" turns up nothing... But since Michael is such a popular name on this planet (Jordan, Jackson, Johnson... etc.) I just typed it in and I'd like to share some interesting results (if you don't believe me go  urlLink here !):  michael is one hot papi chulo michael is very sexy michael is missing michael is cool michael is god the father as taught by brigham young michael is the devil michael is not only ugly michael is gonna kick jpm's fat butt on sunday michael is no longer a thriller michael is guilty michael is innocent michael is gonna be ok michael is the devil i'm disliking him more and more michael is the kind of guy some people love to hate michael is leaving las vegas michael is he who is michael is nuts michael is humble michael is hottt  michael is a 17 year old male who has attempted suicide   You guys read the one in bold!  Wow.. no that's not me!  Anyways try that out... if you're bored.  Especially if you have a common name like mine.  I kind of forgot what I was going to post so I'll end here!  Fun.
