I am Jeremiah, but Daem0n or Faust is more common nowadays, although my nicknames range from "Iah" (pronounced, a'ya), to Jerry, to Jem, to Je, to Jere, to Ian, to Mai, and other.  I'm Filipino by blood, but I have no nationality, just because I don't carry any of their traditions.  Please, if you want to join 20 questions, don't hesitate.  You have 20 questions to ask yourself, so try to catch up.  They're at their eighth.  There's Starbuck here for the bourgeoises, and we have other food stores from other countries wit hdifferent names.  What is yer nationality, if any?
