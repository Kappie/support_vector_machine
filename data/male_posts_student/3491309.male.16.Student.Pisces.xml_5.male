That is where i get confused and that is why i dont haev a strong opinion.... I want to accept people for who they are and so personally it does not bother me but at the same time i want to go with what the Bible says and i jsut get confused over the whole matter.      Now, one of these days I'll have to sit down and do some color-coded highlighting in my Bible, because I can't find the specific verses that apply to homosexual relations. In the previous entry, I made a notion that suggested that in the political arena, at this time, gay marriage should be legalized; however, my friend is concerned with how to be obedient to God. Let's see if this old noggin still remembers the answer to this question!      For Christians, generally speaking, the Bible is the highest authority, if they don't consider it to be the only one. Now, the Bible is clear on this: hate the sin, love the sinner. This means that while we cannot condone sins (such as acting on homosexual urges), we are to lovethe sinner. Simple as pie. This may be less known, but as Christian people, we know that to be tempted is not a sin in of itself; therefore, it is permissible for the gay person to have an urge to sin in that trademarked way, just so long as the gay person does not entertain those thoughts in his mind, or act on them.      But what about the temptations in the first place? This is a ratherold question, and I shall refer to Job. Job was a prosperous man who essentially became a pawn in a bet of God versus Satan. God let Satan torture Job within an inch of his life, yet Job remained faithful to God. When asked by his wife as to why Job didn't just rebuke God, Job replied, "God gives me good things. Why should I not accept the bad?"      This is how I decide to answer this question. We have temptations so that we will come to rely on God for strength. I'm not sure if I've answered the key question here: how do you be a good Christian and allow the sin of gay marriage to be legalized?      Perhaps the best answer I can give is the word of Jesus himself. Anyone who's been to Sunday School is familiar with Jesus saying, "Why point out the splinter in your neighbor's eye when there's a plank in your own?" Live godly the best YOU can. Remember the words of Francis of Asissi: "Preach the Word always, and when necessary, use words." Indeed, there are some sins that must be spoken out against, like abortion. But is gay marriage one of those? I would say no, since while there is an interference with the gift oflife when it comes to gay relations, but abortion is essentially murder. That's the difference I use.      Bottom line: Make your life a witness to God, and others will follow.
