I am unaware of whether I've returned to a previous state of mind but at any rate I'm in a situation that I have never been in before... damn.  Les Mis lurches toward me at the moment, and I guess it really hits me on Tuesday. We have a run from the Tech on Tuesday to the final performance on Saturday, spending at least 4 hours at Balcarras a day. It's almost over now. Lame. But still, it's definitely been worth it. If nothing else I've got to know the music, which is worth a lot to me, because I'm kind of obsessive about it now. And I've met a load of nice peoples... *cries*  *laughs* I guess I'm slightly depressed at the moment. Slightly lonely. Feeling a bit of an idiot. Oh well... see you lot later.  Quote of the day: "And I'm a creep, And I'm a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here, When I don't belong here?"  From Radiohead's   Creep   Love, Jon Roskilly
