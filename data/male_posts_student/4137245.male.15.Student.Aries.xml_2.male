August 5th  Heard the drumline today-too bad they cant do that during the show-jk but seriously-they seem to get off beat alot...cant they hear it? Maybe im just too picky?  Today me and james spent some quality time practicing for All State Jazz--yeah thats right, Jazz. Ive got a lot of problems with the way society views Jazz.  I asked a lot of people what their take on jazz is.....most people said that it involves a lot of bending notes and swinging_______________________________TOTTALLY WRONG ANSWER!!  Anyways im sorry for ranting but people just dont seem to get it.  Pop artists, rock and "rollers", and other music genres dont take much talent--and yet they get paid the most.  Jazz is probably the most difficult music to understand and create and they still dont get any respect.  Seriously whens the last time you heard a jazz artist being featured at the Grammys?  Its all bout the looks nowdays..not the music.  Did anybody by any chance catch the Grammy's this year?  Chick Corea with the Foo Fighters? WTF!!!! And not to mention that all of the jazz awards were announced before the actual Grammy Telecast.  Really Lame!  Im not saying that you should pay all your money to support Jazz artists, but what i am saying is to give them some respect.    Oh yeah, and when jazz musicians play in a combo and solo, they are making that stuff off the top of their head---most people (lamens) dont know that!  And Kenny G is not a Jazz artist------he is a smooth jazz artist....big difference.
