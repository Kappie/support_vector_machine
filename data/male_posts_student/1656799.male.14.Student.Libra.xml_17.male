If you do not meet these demands, I shall be forced to peck you on the head with my sharp green beak. If you are to harm me, I'm sure my dozen or so other friends will be here to hurt you. Skin us alive and with our feathers make a little rainbow thingy."     Conclusive proof Swindon really has lost it.  (Or me perhaps.)
