Thankfully the porn aspect is alllesbian scenes (female astronauts and slaves getting it on), and no beastiality.However, to put it simply, this film is insane. First of all, they really just used whateverapes costumes they could find as opposed to one uniform costume forall the apes. Thisincludes a pink ape, whom is gay. The 'alarm" that goes off at one point is simply a police siren plugged into a wall. The sign pointing to the Forbidden Zone is a computer generated arrow saying "Forbidden Zone." The acting was bad not in the typical porn way, but as if the actors were actually trying to say their lines in the craziest way possible. And, for some reason, at several points in the film the cast of characters suddenly bust a rhyme. But anyway, it certainly got the job done and I recommend it.
