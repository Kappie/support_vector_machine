It was awesome, I wake up and found out my mom has bought an ice cream cake from DQ, Dairy Queen, which is ALWAYS cool! Wait, I missed something, I wake up to Alyssa. She has called my house to tell me that she is taking me to see a movie. That movie being irobot. Starring Wil Smith, Alyssa said it made her sad but I don't buy that. Loo, Just Kidding.  So I go over to Alyssa's house afterwards, because she was my ride back to my house, I call my parents to see if Alyssa can come, and she can. So we go back to my house and find out that my parents bought me an MP3 player, which is cool. And then Alyssa and I (with a little of my sister) swim for a little, then we hang around and watch TV. Then we go back and drop off Alyssa.  I still have poison ivy, and it still itches a lot. But, Oh well. I'll live.  Today I didn't do much. I read a little bit, hung out with my brother and Amanda at my house, then hung out at Amanda's house. Mucho fun, I guess.  Party's on Sunday!
