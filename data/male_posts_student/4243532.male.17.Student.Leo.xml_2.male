All it talks about is about a powerless woman who wants to leave her boring husband and live a life full of romance, passion, and sex. She has Multiple affairs and buys expensive shit until she and her husband are broke. After she realizes her lovers never loved her and she ruined her life, she poisons herself. Then later on, her husband dies. The child they had together ends up working in a cotton mill. Well, there you have it...the French always have to over-dramatize and make life seem empty and shallow. The plot sucks. If I the writer, I would just have Emma (the powerless woman) start whipping her tits out and get attention, instead of sneaking around like a two-cent slut. I know it is set in times where women had to be "pleasant" but come on...it's France. France is the fucking capital of the world. People go to France to fuck. What else? Admire a crappy metal tower that looks like a crappy wire? Anyhow...French literature sucks. If you want to write a book and you are French, don't.
