Have got to get down to work. I have got a severe backlog of essays which I need to finish.  Met Shyama for a little get together before she leaves tomorrow. We didn't talk much, but that's ok. We're close enough to know that words are of not much significance. I want more wholesome people like Shyama, Khin and Leon. They are innocent. Nobody is absolutely innocent, but these people keep it clean. I want to be with them. It's a pity. I think there might be tears tomorrow at the airport.  I think I'm losing interest in writing coz I can't write any more. I feel like my writing's going in circles and that I've got no more energy to go on. There are some articles which I've been thinking about but they are too complex in thought and too tedious to put down on paper, or here for that matter.  Tell me reader. Am I losing my flare?
