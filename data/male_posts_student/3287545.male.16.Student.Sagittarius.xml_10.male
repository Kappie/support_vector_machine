I gave her a load of bullshit saying that it didn’t feel right going out with her when I didn’t love her. I guess that’s partly true but the fact I’m gay and the fact I actually don’t like here also play a part in the desission I made to end it all. I havn’t posted it yet, and I don’t intend to for a few days. Shes going on holiday next week so I’ll post it then so she gets it when she comes back, I don’t want to spoil her holiday. God I’ve just had a though though, what if she buys me something from spain, and comes back to find a letter saying I want to break up our relationship. I’ll have to tell her I don’t want her to buy me anything. If she phones tonight, which wouldn’t surprise me, I might tell her I wrote her a letter, I’m not sure if I should, I wont tell her what the letters about, no I wont. I’ll tell her not to buy me anything and post the letter while she’s on holiday. I really am not sure if I can do it though, it’s a really simple action, putting a letter though a slot but the consequences will be so bad I’m sure. She’ll tell all her friends, who are kind of my friends and they’ll hate me I think. I suppose they might see it from my point of view, especially if Katie lets them read the letter, I hope she does because I want to be able to explain my reasoning to all the girls as well as Katie. Hopefully they’ll support me, they know things aren’t that great between us, and hopefully they will agree that I shouldn’t go out with someone I don’t love. Perhaps they will even feel sorry for me, which would be good, it would be really good if they all felt sorry for me including Katie and could all understand where I’m coming from and we could all remain friends that would be great. I think we go back to school on a Monday, and first lesson I have ICT, with Katie, which is not ideal. I want to see her at lunch time and give her a big hug straight away, and hopefully she’ll think it’s sweet and forgive me so I can put my conscience to rest. Anyway, the other day, Saturday, I went to Katies house and we watched a couple of movies. I brought round virtual sexuality, which I personally think is a pretty cool film, but she didn’t really give it a chance and nor did her brother who insisted on sitting in the living room with us. She just wouldn’t shut up though both films we watched going on and on and on about her new job. She just keeps on talking and she says the same things over and over. It’s really annoying me now that she keeps on saying realistically, it’s as if shes trying to impress me with what she thinks is a big word and with her psychological knowledge which is frankly a load of bolloks. Yesterday she phoned me up, AGAIN, and was lecturing me on how people shouldn’t change themselves physically. I meen I can understand how changing your mental self is not a good thing, because that is something built in and can’t be changed unless you act or were acting as the case my be. Then she go’s and contradicts this by saying it’s ok to dye your hair, cause she dyes her’s. I think she’s confusing changing your mental self and physical self. She was also saying that people should be happy with how they look and not try to change it, she is so stupid, change is key to progression, the thing that made our race so powerful. The thing that after thousands of years has allowed me to touch a button in a controlled environment, in a democratic society, and make a character magically appear on the glass panel in front of my eyes. Katie now want’s us to do something over the holidays, and my mum insists that she has to come here, to my house, which I don’t want. She wants to take things further, I know she does. Like when I was at her house the other day. She was sitting there and she said, ‘people like shona keep saying we have to take things further tonight’ which was blaitently a hint at me to actually go a head and take things further. She is so crap at hints, and I hate hints, say what you meen and don’t try and cover it up with some shit. Yesterday on the phone she said to me, ‘why don’t you take hints very well’ – that bitch, she has the audacity to say that I don’t take hints, oh, I get the hints, I receive the hints, I process the hints, I juat pretend I don’t to fob her off. I can’t belive the silly cow isn’t getting that, does she not realise that every time she hints at comeing round mine I make an obvious excuse as to why she can’t, she’s the one that doesn’t take a fucking hint. Just a minute ago is was thinking I can’t send that letter but all I have to do is think about that conversation and I’ll have no problem sending the fucking thing. For the rest of the conversation on the phone I didn’t really bother listening, I just left her to yap on while I watched TV, and just said the occasional ahh-huh. I think by the end of it she was realising that I was angry with her, and when she said bye and just bye back and slammed the phone down, hopefull she’ll start to get the message. Hopefully she’ll see a bad side to me which will cushion the hurt when she reads the letter.
