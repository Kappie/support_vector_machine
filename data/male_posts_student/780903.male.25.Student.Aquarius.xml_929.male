You've really got to read this for yourself, but basically it's a lawyer who's being denied meal reimbursement for a meal he ate while working  on Christmas Day  because it was out of the approved 10-block radius, because all of the restaurants he checked within the 10-block radius were closed.  Excuse me while I cry now.
