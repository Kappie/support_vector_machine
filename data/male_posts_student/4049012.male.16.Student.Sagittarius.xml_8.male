The experience of watching some slutty (or in rare instances, non-slutty) girl flirt with this obvious moron of a guy across the food court, or other stereotypical teenage hang out. And I don't necessarily mean just silly teenage girls, either. I mean "women" in their 20s. I thought after the teen years, women were supposed to settle down and know their place and all that happy shit. Apparently not. I know I've said it many a time before, but it just seems ass backwards that girls can shamelessly lead some guy on and taunt him all to hell but when a guy does it, oh no, the end is near. Now don't give me the usual excuse of "well, girls are harmless and men can damage someone emotionally by leading them on". No. Actually, men and women are quite equal in the world of causing emotional disaster. Women may actually be more evil than men.  Evolutionary theory would, in some way, dictate that after these many thousands of years of men and women co-existing in the same world, day in and day out, this constant little tiff known as the battle of the sexes would subside. It's quite simple, really. The penis is  equal  to the vagina. And vice versa. Men couldn't exist without women (in most cases), and the same is true for women. Hell, if one gender just disappeared, there would be no human race after a hundred years or so. So, why all this bullshit between men and women? Are we still that fucking primitive, that the only way to solve some little catfight is to claim one gender's superiority to the other? Besides, there's really no reason to constantly fire up the opposite gender because you have some insecure little notion that men/women are out to get you. Come on, people. 4 in 10 marriages end in divorce. You know why? Stupid, petty shit. Such as cheating. Hell, if people would control their urges 38% more of the time, men and women would be a lot less awkward around each other.   Oh, and another thing, thanks in part to Rie, and in part to my own little discovery. Love is a fun word to throw around at small office parties and other public venues to garner the needed attention to keep your ego inflated, and it is a really cool notion. You know, sharing a life together, having kids, etc. But so rarely does it ever materialize. The majority, perhaps around 3/4ths of all said couples "in love" is nothing more than lust, and this primitive urge to make the relationship last, even if it's obviously crumbling quickly. As hard as it has been for me to do, and everyone else, I'm sure, just let it go. There is more than "the one" woman for guys, and likewise for women. Hell, you just might encounter 6 or more "the ones" in your life. So don't act so superior because your boyfriend/girlfriend "loves" you. Because it's probably not substantial.   And, one more thing, going back to the first paragraph-y, if women and men ever want to be on the same level (which is, too, a nice notion, but will most likely never happen), both genders need to cut the hypocritical, victimization bullshit and accept each other as they come. Women like to use their supposed superior will and intelligence to do the following regularly: 1). Change their attitude based on a trivial occurance in every day life (ie- I broke a heel, therefore, I now hate you) 2). Flirt with hotter guys and act as if they've been offended if you ever so much as bring it up to them. This isn't always the case, but it is quite a lot. 3). Act shitty and/or sad toward you in order to gain more of your affection, preventing you from straying to other girls. This, too, isn't always the case, but yeah, it happens too much.  And as for guys: 1). Proclaim love to some girl they met 4 days ago, in a meger attempt to fuck her a few times and pull the "I'm not ready for a long term relationship" card. 2). Cheat, and cheat like hell. The same is true for some women. 3). Act entirely dense and unaware of a woman's needs.   And, no, don't tell me "men and women will always be opposites". No. You make it that way. True, women and men will never be exactly the same, but come on, cut the shit and be sincere for once in your fucking lives. And, if you do, you'll catch a lot less shit farther down the road, relationship wise.  Just a thought.
