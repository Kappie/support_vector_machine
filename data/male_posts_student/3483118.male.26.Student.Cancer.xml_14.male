Or if I was trying to be like George I'd call it the cachinnation test and then allude to Seutonius or somebody.  Before commenting on today's column, though, I want to note that this is not the first time he's pushed wishful thinking as real insight.  Media Matters busted him a little while back.  Click  urlLink here  to have a look.    Late update: I just found a  urlLink blog post by Paul Waldman  that says pretty much everything else I was fixing to say about Will's preposterous "contribution" to the marketplace of ideas.  Best to direct your attention to his post rather than just crib it into mine.
