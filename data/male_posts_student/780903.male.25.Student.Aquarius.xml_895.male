Maybe we can get some cross-blog debates going about the merits and deficiencies of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.  Maybe not.  :)  Actually, if I was in the mood for an ego-bruising, I'd figure out some way to get a poll up so anyone who reads both of our blogs could vote on who they think'll do better on the final exam.  :)  I'm not serious.
