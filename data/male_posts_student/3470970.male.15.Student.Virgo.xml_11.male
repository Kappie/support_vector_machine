Not because he's an outstandingly good teacher, or because he's a genius, but because of his ability to pop around, down and up. I managed to record one of his magic disappearances, when he crawled into his magic hiding cave, right under his desk, then after a second or so, he re-appeard, and the lesson went on. Maybe he quickly had a shot of Scotish Whiskey? Who knows.. I really can't imagine what's under there, but I might go and explore tomorrow. Exciting isn't it?  urlLink    (click on picture to download video)
