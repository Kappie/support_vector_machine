Why does the Poet fixate on one point of view or one perspective and make the world aware of it or urge/force the world to look at it through that perspective alone through his expression? Why does the Poet try to change, through all the means and ways he can, the ways of the world using his expression? Why cannot the Poet, even after realising the fact that words can only, in the best case, be triggers, to bring about a consciousness, but can never be catalyst in affecting a complete social change, still fight for his ideals by means of his expression? Would the Poet at some time or another turn his back to the world, after realizing at the some point in his journey, that all he did was receive the torch from his predecessors before, who shouted and appealed on the top of their voices of the things that are amiss around them just like him, get disillusioned and leave his expression? Would the Poet make sure that torch would still be lit and glow bright by the time he hands it over to his successor, while shedding light on topics and issues, that he found worth shouting for using his expression? Why does the Poet need to be an idealist? Why cannot the Poet's pragmatism (practicality), cynicism and pessimism branch away from his idealism and join the mainstream talking about the regular beauty of the nature around and the regular everyday aspects of life? What makes the Poet continue on and on inspite of an impossible task ahead of him, inspite of an impossible audience that refuse to join him and inspite of the daunting opposing forces inside of him, that make his every step a hard and a heavy one, that make his every idea completely out of sync with the careless world around him, that finally make his very existence a conflicting one?       The tone (and tune) of Struggle resonates through the empty halls of inaction whenever the Poet raises his voice and appeals to the world. His inability to adjust to the situations around him and his discomfiture in letting things as they are, unquestioned, unheeded and un-cared for, furthers his inner fire to billow out and lend the lone voice of resistance against the status quo. Apathy disturbs him, inaction concerns him, lethargy irks him, ignorance infuriates him. The inner struggle gets to the point that the Poet starts doubting himself, whether the problem lies within him in getting in tune with the world, leading a seemingly normal life, ignoring the issues and side-stepping the problems or whether the world is really on the road to self-destruction and he is the only one cursed to foresee the future, but still unable to stem the self-bleeding. On the path of the declaration of the war against the world, the Poet first tries to identify the problem, make the world aware of it, offer his version of the solution and continue chipping away towards the end, until one of the things happen - he gets completely dejected and joins the rest of the herd or time and energy catch up with him and silences his voice. While bracing up for the war, the Poet summons all the weaponry at his disposal - irony, satire, sarcasm, motivation, derision, belittlement, encouragement to spur the world and set the chain of events that would finally set it in motion towards his version of the same. The Poet blindly believes that given the right set of tools, creating the right set of conditions, and showing the right kind of solutions, the world would dance to his tunes and enthusiastically follow his lead leaving its past and present behind while marching towards its future as dictated and laid out by the Poet.       In his blind and optimistic enthusiasm, he conveniently forgets that world he is fighting for was never behind his back in the battlefield, while he gets mauled in the field. The conditions dampen his spirits, the forces cut his enthusiasm at the knees, the issues make a laughing stock of his bravery. Alone, wounded and bleeding, resignation sets in and disillusionment follows. The world, whose situation and plight moved him in the first place, waits conveniently on the sidelines watching the ghastly scene without even raising a finger and coming for his neither his aid nor his support. Deserted by his followers and butchered by the forces, the Poet develops a deep sense of resentment against the weak world that refused to take his side, in order that it not be disturbed from its current position, however wretched it might be. Reality sinks in at this stage and the Poet comes to realize that it has always been the same, before him, with him and even goes to the extent that it would remain the same after him. The purpose that he was passionate about till then mocks him in his face, nullifying all the serious efforts that he has put in till date, proving that in the grand scheme of things that it is not change that is constant but it is the inability to change that is constant. The dawn of this realization upon the Poet takes him to the other end of the spectrum - the one where cynicism and pessimism lurk around, waiting to embrace yet another voice with open arms. The Poet would there find himself in the august company of the past and the present voices that have tried equally, if not more, to impart their vision and their version of the world on the existing conditions. The Poet would still struggle in (t)his new position, and continues to make noise even at this new forum.       After the struggle has come full circle - war cry, bitter defeat and ground reality, the Poet starts to pick up the pieces analyzing the causes for his defeat. The goals were more ideal than they were practical, the plan was more outlandish that it was implementable, the dream was more a dream than it was real. Once the Poet comes to an understanding with himself that it was his modus operandi that has to be faulted rather than the goals and the dreams, he changes his voice to reflect more of hope and optimism than of bravado and brashness. He realizes that society could be changed but only in a brick by brick fashion, than confront the entire system head on, and try to tear down the entire structure without exactly revealing the blue print for his vision of the world. When he breaks down the task in steps, building solutions for each step, suddenly the success or failure of his solution does not faze him, for he is well aware that change is never a variable of time. The Poet lets go of his ego at this stage and is merely contended to keep the torch bright so that he could pass it on and see his dreams realized much much later after his time. The Poet comes to terms that followers or not, listeners or not, he owes it to himself to welcome the signs of the change and become the harbinger of the eventual shift.       There comes a point in every Poet's career, when he chooses either to ignore his inner calling, just because he is defeated and dejected, or dust up and get back right on the horse to wage his battle all over again, again and again. Should he choose to remain with the latter, the churning of his inner self (antar madhanam) and whirlpool of his ideas and ideals (antaranga madhanam), would never let him to get off the course, guiding him (and the ones who choose to follow him) to that brave new world, where ideals become implementable and dreams turn into reality.
