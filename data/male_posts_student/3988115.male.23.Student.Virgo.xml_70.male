A serial toe-licker is prompting lawmakers to consider making such unsolicited attention a criminal offense.  Police arrested a man in Rotterdam earlier this week after a female sunbather complained he unexpectedly licked her bare foot. Other women have also complained. The man has reportedly pursued his fetish for years -- but Rotterdam prosecutors say they are powerless to put their feet down.  A prosecution spokesman told the Rotterdam Daily newspaper, "A lick over the foot doesn't qualify as a crime" -- without an overt sex act.  Two Labor Party members have asked the justice minister to change the law.  In their formal complaint, the men ask how it's possible to "prosecute someone for throwing a cigarette butt or soda can on the ground, but not for this kind of misbehavior."
