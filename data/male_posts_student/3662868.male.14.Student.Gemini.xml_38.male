If you'll look back to the previous posts, you'll realize that I said "I respect you and your script writing skills". No offence should have been taken. I was simply stating my opinion of something that had been welling up inside my head for a while. I simply needed to voice this opinion and I was hoping that you guys would respect that. I was hoping that our lines of communication could stay clear, uncensored, and un obstructed. Unfortunately, due to the voicing of my opinion, things have become unclear. We need something to...clear the air...hmm... I'll think of something.
