Reminds me of Indrajal comics. The Times group used to publish those. That was sometime in the 80's when I used to read them. Phantom, Mandrake, Flash Gordon and an Indian hero named Bahadur. Bahadur was a karate champ. Phantom and Mandrake were my favorites, I never liked Bahadur as much. I don't know whether it was an indianized version of some other character, but it was quite well made.  It will be fun to see how Spiderman turns out.   urlLink BBC NEWS | Entertainment | Spider-Man gets Indian make-over
