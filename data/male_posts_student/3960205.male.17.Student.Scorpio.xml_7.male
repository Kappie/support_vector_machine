Not another thought came to my mind except spending my time with my darling cousins. Although the family reunion takes place every two years, this time was the best as we are all older than we were the last time and that led to better understanding among us. We four raided all the icecream parlours in the town and put them into business. The soft ice cream machine at Home Needs must be missing us cause we all used to have atleast two rounds of icecream every evening. We ransacked the Bangalore bakery out of its puff supply and Anand sweets out of their sweet supply each day. I'm not forgetting Priyanka restaurant for the wonderful Butter chicken and Chilli chicken. However Chinna could not be with us most of the time as he had his examinations to cope up with. Every one of us enjoyed the trip to Godavari river which was in its full flow even though we could not go boating in it.  I'm going to have a hearty laugh every time i pass by the tiny island in the middle of Godavari about which Chitti was very excited and wanted to buy it for herself. I will neither forget the animated chats we had nor the the usual teasing each other.  But i'm not at all dissapointed that i'm all alone again because of the optimist in me who looks forward for better days in the next reunion.  Current music : Gurtukostunnayee.......
