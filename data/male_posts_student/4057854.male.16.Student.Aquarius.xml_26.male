    
         Well, this is the first time I write on this blog.  I just want to introduce myself, I'm a 16 years old boy from   Mexico   now living in the   USA  . I like to play soccer and computer games and I like to listen to rap music in spanish and english. My favorite school subject is Geometry and I like to learn new computer related stuff. As you can see, I'm not a fluent english speaker, my first language is spanish and I have been 3 years in the US learning english.
