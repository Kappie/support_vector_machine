I listened to David for an entire bus trip from Dingle to Galway, which is lengthy. Gotta love the repeat function. And Ulli and I would occasionally listen to David on the ghetto setup that Ulli had going on in his flat (Discman, crazy cords, need I say more?). My girlfriend insists on you guys being at the wedding. Only problem is if Ulli's coming, I'll have to tell my mom she can't go. Had a rough week at school here, too, and it's going to be rough for the rest of the term. I've got a Field Research Project to complete on a company's inventory control systems, and we haven't even selected a company yet. Due at the end of the month. I envy Adam and his ESADE courses right now.  To clear up Ulli's confusion..."lil' hunk o' tin" simply means little piece of metal, referring to Conor's camera. "Bumping and grinding" is just what we call dancing all up on girls, and "camera-thumping toughs" just means tough guys who feel the need to beat up on innocent cameras.  The whole bit about Prince of Tides and discuss is taken from a Saturday Night Live skit from a long time ago. If you search for Prince of Tides and SNL on Kazaa, something might turn up. And by Bob, I was referring to Bob Ross, who has this 1/2 hour programme on television where he teaches people how to paint. He's always talking about "happy little trees" and "happy little clouds." I was reading in the Wall Street Journal that his show is broadcast in 20 countries, and Iceland is one of them. He's soon to expand into Russia and Africa. Weird part is, he's been dead for 9 years. Ulli, let me know if that clears everything up (I would offer to clear it up for anyone else, but no one else even reads this blog). Bed calls.  T
