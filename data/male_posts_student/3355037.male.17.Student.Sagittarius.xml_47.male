Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the English language today is the word, fuck. Out of all the English words that begin with the letter f, fuck is the only word referred to as the f-word. Its the one magical word that, just by itself, can describe pain, pleasure, hate and love. Fuck, as most words in the English language, is derived from the German word, ficken, which means to strike. In English, fuck falls into many grammatical categories. As a transitive verb for instance, ‘John fucked Shirley‘, as an intransitive verb, ‘Shirley fucks‘. Its meaning is not always sexual. It can be used as an adjective such as ‘Johns doing all the fucking work‘, as part of an adverb, ‘Shirley talks too fucking much‘, as an adverb enhancing an adjective, ‘Shirley is fucking beautiful‘, as the object of an adverb, ‘Shirley is fucking beautifully‘, as a noun, ‘I don’t give a fuck‘, as part of a word, ‘abso-fucking-lutley‘, or, ‘in-fucking-credible‘, and as almost every word in a sentence, ‘fuck the fucking fuckers‘. As you may realize, there are very few words with the versatility of fuck. As in these examples describing situations, such as, fraud. ‘I got fucked at the used car lot’. Dismay. ‘Aw, fuck it’. Trouble. ‘I guess I'm really fucked now‘. Aggression. ‘Don’t fuck with me, buddy‘. Difficulty. ‘I don’t understand this fucking question‘. Inquiry. ‘Who the fuck was that?’ Dissatisfaction. ‘I don’t like what the fuck is going on here‘. Incompetence. ‘He's a fuckoff‘. Dismissal. ‘Why don’t you go outside and play hide-and-go-fuck-yourself?’. I'm sure you can think of many more examples. With all of these multi-purpose applications, how can anyone be offended when you use this word? We say use this unique, flexible word more often in your daily speech. It will identify the quality of your character immediately, so say it loudly and proudly, 'FUCK YOU'.  I found it quite humorous as well (mostly because of how serious the guy sounded as the music played in the backround), but if you feel differently (i.e. you are offended by this) then I apologize here.
