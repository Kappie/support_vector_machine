I got LY irritated at me, now she's blocking me. Aiya, oversensitive lah, budden a feel abit bad!? but seriously, she had no reason to block me. Nvm lor, not my prob anymore. 2. BZ is spreading the SK gang thing around in class, and he and Kaleni are v irritating. At times like this, i don't regret blocking Gabriel, I mean, he deserves it for inducting BZ. Now BZ seems to be impersonating me on the SK blog...dotz. Anyway, bad day, maybe tommorow will be better rite, it can't be worse, unless I really screw up my Chinese O lvl orals.
