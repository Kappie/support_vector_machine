I don't want to talk about my place of employment too much, but I can't let this one slip by. I thought that there were some crazy people in my office(and there are) but the people across the hall should be institutionalized.  First, a little background information. We'll start with Elise--female, black, 20's, entertaining, rather jumpy. Then there is B.J.--male, black, 20's, quiet, 6'3'', dating Elise. Next is Laura--female, white, 40's-50's, LOUD, talks too much. Then comes Carol "C.T." Turner--female, white, 60's, hilarious, curses often. Now there is Dave--male, beyond that I know nothing. Finally there is Shelley--female, white, 50's, nicknamed Chewy(Chewbaca), full-fledged nuts. The office across the hall doesn't have any computers because Shelley crashed the entire network...twice. She is mean to everyone, especially student workers. She tries to convince people that random men are in love with her, they aren't. She eavesdrops with the best of them and can retain, and relay, gossip for years. She clings to people that are nice to her...so much so that she has numerous restraining orders against her because she has followed people to their homes. As I said, she is full-fledged nuts. And so the story begins...  Around 1:30 or so in the afternoon Elise and B.J. are fighting as usual. Evidently Shelley chimed in with a remark or something because B.J. told her to shut-up. It was really none of her business. His comment was followed by Shelley slapping him as hard as she could across the face. Elise freaks out, calls Shelley some names, and calls the police. B.J. is going to press charges. (You can't just attack your co-workers!) An hour or so later Shelley is escorted from the building in handcuffs. This much drama is enough to keep the entire building flowing with gossip for weeks, but there is more. About twenty minutes after Shelley leaves the building, I went to the bathroom. I saw Laura in the hall and she gave me a brief synopsis of what happened following by some nasty comments about Elise and B.J. I returned to work, but Laura did not. She went into the breakroom and started talking, LOUDLY, to Dave about Elise. Elise overheard her and a vicious battle of words ensued. So loud that people came from both sides of the building to find out what was happening. Elise and Laura parted ways, leaving C.T. and Dave in the breakroom. The onlookers began to crowd the breakroom trying to figure out what happened. C.T. told them to get the hell out and go back to work because it was none of their damn business.  This is coming from a woman who if you just looked at her you are reminded of the ideal grandmother.  Anyway, there was lots of goings on and it made for a very entertaining Monday. State workers are the best!  "Insanity in individuals is something rare - but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule."--Friedrich Nietzsche
