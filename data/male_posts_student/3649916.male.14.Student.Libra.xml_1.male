I had exams in the morning, English one first, and that was fairly complicated, did not do well....I have the second part of the English Exam tomorrow that will probably be easy, all i have to do is write a multiparagraph essay in 1 hour and 10min about dreams or wishes.  That is 2nd period, than the rest of the periods i just have normal classes.  Wed is the last day of school pretty much we have a barbecue and an assembly VERY easy day.  Thursday i get off because i do not have exams, and then friday i have to wake up at 8 :30am to take my Math exam which will be very easy because I am a math whiz.  Today in UO i did not do much at all, i stole some things and planted some new plants that i can sell for fair amounts of money in the end.  I did not do much stealing unfortunately.  I havent been in an excellent mood this week so far...HAH what am i talking about it is monday.  I am sort of in a bad mood though, last day i will see my friends for a long time, i am sure one day or two i will go out and get drunk with them lol, that will be fun when i do that!  But then i will be alone for the rest of the summer, just me and my computer.  Also these next 2 days of school are the last days i will ever see or talk to the girl i like, i cant believe it i get a crush on one girl finally, and she moves away...this sucks.  Even though summer is going to be not very exciting i will get drunk as much as possible, many of my friends want to see me drunk because they have not seen me drunk before, and it will be hilarious for them to see me like that....the only problem will be getting home.  But i am sure i wont have any problem with that, it will be fun to do that at least, I am thinking of doing it friday maybe i will ask some friends, they will know what to do haha.
