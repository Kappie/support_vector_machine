No big deal, I'll just make Lindsey put it away, right? WRONG. Lindsey never shows up, doesn't answer his phone. Just between you and me, he's gonna be fired. Well, that's fine, I have two people in at 9 this (Wednesday) morning, to put it away, right? WRONG. Get a phone call from Andrew, "Yeah, I won't be coming in today, I found a job that's gonna pay the bills a little bit better". Well you know what, shithead. Fuck You!  Anyone want a job?
