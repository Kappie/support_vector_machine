Howdy, What's up people? I started school today, it was my last first day of high school! It was pretty good, my best first day. Today I went from math to Spanish II to Economics to english to Chemestry to no where(I have no sixth period) to band. Tomorrow is Wednesday and it should be even block so I won't have a seventh period and will be able to leave before lunch. But overall I enjoyed it. About an hour ago I got back from Church Band Practice and it was a bit boring because we didn't play that many songs. But anyway I'm gonna go. C-ya!
