I make the point of reading as much of it as I can and I enjoy reading the editorials.  Most of them I disagree with, which makes it fun.  The most recent article by Robyn Abzug I found interesting, to say the very least.  Her article is about, if you didn't see the bold entry topic, how... somehow, we can't be original.  Perhaps I'm getting the wrong message on this thing, but from what I can tell she's talking about superficial things (like clothes and trends) in the school setting.  The whole thing is laughable.  She talks about it like anything different is somehow not different.  It is definitely funny.  Read it.  I might write a letter to the editor for the next edition kicking some ass.
