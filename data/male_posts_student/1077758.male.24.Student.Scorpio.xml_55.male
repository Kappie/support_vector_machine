We've had some scares, and it's rained almost every day.  But we have some pictures of stuff too, which is a good thing.  And yes, my hotmail addy had 60 messages in my junk AND inbox folders, but almost none of them were from actual people I know! I'm shocked!  Come on, people! Show me the love! (Unless there isn't any...which is something we need to talk about whenever I get back, apparently.)  But yeah, it hurt not seeing any messages or anything. That does NOT mean to flood my e-mail box with random crap.  Ah well, I probably won't get on the 'net again until I'm home, which I hope to be Friday/Saturday.  Just letting everyone know that I'm alive.  P.S. We are presently in Southington, Conn.
