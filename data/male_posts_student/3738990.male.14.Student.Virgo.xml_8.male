Ask the lord for his salvation, he is waiting for your call” “I’m afraid I’ve sinned too greatly” said the voice behind the wall.  “Let’s see if I have got it straight - your wife... her name is Liza She’s inclined to wear her dresses rather short She was bending over looking for an ice cream in the freezer When you, behind her, had this lustful thought She had to lean way over, for she isn’t very tall...” “And I wanted chocolate brickle” said the voice behind the wall.  “Now, I know you’re newly-married (since you made your vows before us) But married people often act up thus It sometimes spoils the pleasure if the sex is too decorous So I see no reason why to make a fuss Perhaps your wife objected... did she try to start a brawl?” “No... I think she rather liked it” said the voice behind the wall.  “Then go, my son, I find no blame... your actions may be kinky Tell Liza to be careful with her dress Next time she looks for ice cream to wear something long and slinky Then her husband will have nothing to confess We will not throw you out of church... I find no sin at all...” “Well they threw us out of Woolworths!” said the voice behind the wall.
