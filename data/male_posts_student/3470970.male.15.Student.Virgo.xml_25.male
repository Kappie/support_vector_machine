I am having a biology test tomorrow, on digestion, which is an exceptionally pleasant part; after all, every-one has an anus, right?     Biology is ok, but art is going on my nerves again. Doing these dumb pastel drawings, oh, sorry, not pastel Clich√© or something like that. I got corrected today, because I said pastel. Nvm...art is the only subject hippies are allowed to teach anyway. I discovered an online radiostation which broadcasts rap music, it is Hungarian so it has some Hungarian rap on it aswell, which can relax me especially, since I don't get to listen to much of that out here.  Click  here  to listen to it. You should have WinAmp to listen to it, but I think it works with other players aswell.(download the small file and play it with winamp)       This is the most hilarious website in the world, and  no  it is not porn, though it really does have a strange name. Anyways, what it does, is that it fills pages up with swearwords, so instead of "The man", you would see "the assf*cking man" you have to check it out!(just switch the language to the language of the site you want to change and enter the address of the site eg. www.hello.com...I often do it with www.bbcnews.com)   Enjoy.
