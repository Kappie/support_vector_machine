He's dressed kind of late 80's cool - almost like something out of 21 jumpstreet, with cool hair and a flannel shirt, etc.   Lots of whispers among the class (i.e. "Who's the new guy?" "Boy, he's cute!").   Later, rumors begin spreading.  The new guy has been bouncing around for years in different graduate school programs.  He started off in public policy, then he was in art history, then law school, and now education.  His parents supposedly died in a car accident.  There's a rumor that he killed one of his old professors.   A few classes in, someone gets the guts to talk to him during a break.  Next class, one of the girls asks him out. He responds by saying "you shouldn't fall for me... I'm a drifter... do you know what that means?"   Later, the class begins to accept him.  He makes a point in class to the professor and his classmates start to back him up.  He notices the difference and is clearly touched.   Finally, there is a test.  Some of the students in the class cheat by xeroxing a copy of the test and circulating it.  The new guy is not one of them, because he says he doesn't want to be part of that.  After the test, the professor finds a copy that someone used to cheat.  Next class, he demands that the guilty person admit to it, or else "everyone will get a 0%."  Silence.  No one is admitting to it.  And then... the new guy stands up and says he did it.  Everyone is shocked.  The professor tells him he will be expelled from the program, and he says fine. After class, he's walking off down the hall when the class stops him.   "Hey, New Guy...  Why'd do you say you did it?"   New Guy: "For the first time, I felt like I was part of a family.  You accepted me into your hearts, and it meant something to me...  That's why I did it."   New guy dramatically walks off.
