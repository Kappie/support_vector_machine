I have however, been having a go at a diabalo thing I have, which I haven't used in ages. If you don't know what it is, this is one of the only pictures I could find of them:     It's easy to make it spin and then throw it up from the string, the difficult part is trying to catch it before it breaks a priceless vase. Luckily, we have no priceless vases in the house.  I've also recently re-discovered the computer game of Caesar III. Although it's old, it's very good, and also very addictive. I was playing it for several hours last night, completing the next level. I'm a bit out of practice though, it was taking me ages to build up any decent city, but I got there in the end. I shouldn't really be playing computer games though, I do have exams starting very, very soon. I probably should revise more. Meh, there's a lot of things I should probably do. And I did well on my mocks without revising at all. Well, nothing below B grades anyway. As long as I get good maths and science grades I'll be happy. Who cares about English, business, geography and German? Ok, universities might, but meh. I'll worry about them when the time comes. Who knows, I may not even go to university. And then all that work would have been for nothing. So I must now concentrate on maths and science, as they are what I am doing for A-level.  I also did a bit of English revision this morning. Actually, I only annotated a few poems in my Anthology. But I don't plan to do a lot of revision for English. If I have most of the notes in my Anthology, I don't need to memorize them. And you're either good at writing essays about them or you're not. Luckily, I'm fairly good. I managed to get an average grade B on the mock, which I thought was quite good.  Oh, and for some weird reason, I also plan to learn to write with my left hand this summer. I considered it may be slightly useful.  And another random point, I recently came into possession of a song that I thought was fairly good, apparently by Monty Python. It's good, if you don't mind a little swearing. Ok, a lot of swearing. In fact, nearly the entire thing is swearing. It  IS  good though. The lyrics:  Ho ho f*****g ho,  What a crock o' s**t,  We all work for Santa Claus,  We've had enough, we quit.  Cos we do all the f****n' work while he stars in the show,  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  I'm Rudolph and I quit.  Just who's he think he is?  That little fat c**t sat back in the sleigh,  crackin' that f****n' whip.  And me stuck up the front, with these other useless c**ts,  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  (Chorus)  Ho ho f*****g ho,  What a crock o' s**t,  We all work for Santa Claus,  We've had enough, we quit.  Cos we do all the f****n' work while he stars in the show,  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  And what about us elves,  we've had enough as well,  workin' in that freezing factory, it's cold as f*****g hell,  we work until we drop, with our bollocks freezin' off,  stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  (Chorus)  Ho ho f*****g ho,  What a crock o' s**t,  We all work for Santa Claus,  We've had enough, we quit.  Cos we do all the f****n' work while he stars in the show,  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  I'm Santa Claus' wife,  I know what he's really like,  sneakin into them little kid's rooms  he's a f****n' paedophile,  A devious old drunk,  and I'm married to the c**t,  So stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  (Chorus)  Ho ho f*****g ho,  What a crock o' s**t,  We all work for Santa Claus,  We've had enough, we quit.  Cos we do all the f****n' work while he stars in the show,  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.  Stick yer Christmas up yer arse, ho ho f*****g ho.    Trust me, it is good. Honest...  That's about all for today. Goodbye, my devoted readers.
