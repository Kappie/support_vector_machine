Anyway only a little more than a week till i get back and about a week and a half till i start up band. I am currently sitting in Gainesville in the AC while the rest of my bandmates are out on the marching field sweating and burning away(pause for evil laughter). But no not really i wish i was there so i wont be so behind when i do finally make my grand apearance. Well i guess i should get back to work see you guys later.
