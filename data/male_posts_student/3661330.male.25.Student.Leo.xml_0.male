So I'm just going to write whatever comes to my head in a kind of stream of consciousness method- lets see where to begin, I need some sex, need it bad. But I'm trying to be faithful to my girlfriend who is out of town. She is always out of town, working, which leaves me all alone in town working and going to school all by my lonesome. I'm glad I'm a little older now or otherwise I would have probably cheated on her many many times by now. In a town like this, you don't have to travel far to find good looking women. My old self would have given in a long time ago to temptation and everything in between. But I'm trying, I'm really trying to look beyond the madness and to not give in to meaningless sex. Meaningless? Meaningless to whom? It would be pretty goddamn meaningful to me, but I guess no one would ask me when it came down to a question of fidelity. So its me and my girlfriend's cat, all alone every night, me studying, my cat batting at me, fighting for attention. If only my girlfriend craved attention from me like my furry friend. Some people tell me to let those old school desires of promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners go and revel in my relationship- but its hard sometimes to see the bigger picture with all these little girlies runnin' around looking all good and your girlfriend is miles away, oblivious to the entire scene. Besides for me, at this point in my life I'm not completely invested in settling down- its much more interesting to meet different women every night, let things lead where they may and never get serious- but don't get me wrong, its also nice to have the things that couples have together beyond the sexual realm.
