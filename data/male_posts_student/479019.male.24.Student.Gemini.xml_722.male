NY cops aren't as good as being corrupt as LA cops... an LA cop wouldn't be stupid enought to post all the bad things he did on his xanga.  I mailed my paper, watched  Dark City , and  The Last Dragon , and ate nuggets and taquitos today.   Dark City  was cool. Jennifer Connelly movies are usually enjoyable, not because she's hot (even though she is), but because they are usually cool. Like Rockeeter, Hulk, Requiem for a Dream, and a Beautiful Mind. The movie came out a year before the first Matrix movie and has a lot of similiarities.   The Last Dragon  is cheesy as hell, but funny.  I feel better today, despite the sniffling.  **
