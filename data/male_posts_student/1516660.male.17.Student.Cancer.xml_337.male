I'll post it down below later, yeah?   Hmm. I woke up quite early (8) today morning to go to 883 with Mother. I ate the fried mian with guo tiao. I just reminded myself why I hate that type of food. Garlic, big pieces, are abound! Horrors! After eating, we brought 8 Days and went to Shop N Save. Oh. A slight mistake in my report yesterday. The thief is a female. Heh. They meowed and meowed. After meowing a lot and buying some snacks, we went home and reached home by 10.   Moo meow moo. Hmm.I am supposed to print the verification slips for Ji and WQ. I'll do it later. This hour is to meow at the cats online and wait for Father to return so we can visit MaMa. HaHa. I forgot to switch on my phone, and when I did, I got a surprise. One from KS, one from CQ and four from XC the very bored. Meow moo meow!!!   Hmm. Dad returned at 11 and we went there lor. HaHa. Today's sticker color is brown. I must organize a color sticker competition! We've got Green, Purple, White and Brown so far. Calling out to all the cats and ducks and whatnot who read my blog, please cast your vote NOW! Fantastic prizes could be won! Okay, who am I kidding? At least ducks will meow! We are joined by Dai Gu Ma and Yee Pak Pak (Fei Chui's father).  Anyhoo, on to MaMa. Hmm. Her leg's been cut. What can I say? She's more fiesty and lively. Before the operation, when she rejects food, she goes "hmmm moi (don't want) hmmm moi" wearily. Now, she goes "Hmm Moi!" with a sharp crisp tone. She complained more. Last time, she barely mutters a thing. That's good I suppose. Fei Chui came to visit. I was beginning to fell that I like MaMa better when she's not complaining when MaMa became funny. She said she dreamt of her dying and being cremated being wrapped up (like what the ducks did to SARS patient), to which we laughed. She then asked me and Felicia (who is also Fei Chui, by the way) if we are dating ("yao mou pak tour?"), to which everyone laughed (except me and Felicia. Ergh). She at first mistook me for some Ah Meng, which I felt totally insulted. Meow moo meow! Anyhoo, we left at 1.   Hmm. We went to AMK Ave 5 to eat the black chicken rice. YAY! It opened. Ahhh! The heavenly mouth-watering, saliva-inducing chicken and the rice! Meow moo meow!! After that, we went to the NTUC nearby to buy oranges. Meow moo meow!   Okie. Returning home, I made plans to meet WQ they all in Woodlands Stadium to play badminton. Father brought me there. Heh Heh. There's only WQ, CQ, KS and HM. After a while, SL, YC, HL, Gloria, KentKent and Joyce came. Meow meow!! We played till 4. By then, me, KS, WQ, CQ, Gloria, HM, KK, KS and HL decided to go to the McDonalds at Marsiling. We went there and chat. I looked at HL's Bio notes. Wow. That's all I can say. Wow.   Okie opkie. That being done, we decided to go back. KK and I walked back from from Woodlands. Long time never walk that road le. Heh Heh. Hmm. I reached home, bathed and went online to wait for mah dinner. Fried rice was here, nice.   O.O! The new Shell catalogue is brimming with goodies! I want that Panasonic Discman (that can play MP3s, have remote...blah blah. That's worth 4800 points though. How meowful! Oh. DGM called. I always have a bad feeling whenever she calls. It's like she is a bringer of bad news or something. No offense ot her, but that's what I always felt. Anyway, MaMa has been transferred to Ward 9, in the 9th floor. Hmm. Dunnoe which bed though. Meow.  Oh well. I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog! Oh yes yes. My poem. Enjoy!      As a duck, I should meow. Should I really? The puzzle lies, Confusingly.  Meowingly, You tell me. Should I, Or should I not?  In a turmoil, My head spinning, My heart beating, Utter pandemonium!  Closing my eye, I hardly care more. Fate decides, My fate.
