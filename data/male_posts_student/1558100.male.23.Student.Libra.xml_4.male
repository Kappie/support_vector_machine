But I'm sure there'll be some rad people going along, so it shouldn't be that bad.  "Find some good op-shops, infiltrate and then consume, then look quite daggy."  Before I leave, I need to make a mental checklist. So I'll make it on the computer. Yeah! Here we go.  1. Remind Craig to dry his pants. 2. Get batteries for camera. 3. Steal brothers CD player. 4.  urlLink The International Noise Conspiracy  5. Ring Meeaghan (spelling?) about Wood = Toast  Geez, could I make No.5 any more cryptic? Damn, I say damn. You have to say damn, I say damn, in a Samuel L. Jackson voice, because otherwise it's just not cool. And what's Sammy L? He's cool. Correctamundo!
