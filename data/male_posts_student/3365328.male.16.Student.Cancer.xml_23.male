     
      The past week has been pretty uneventful, other than a bit of last-minute revision and my seeing the latest Harry Potter film (Quite good, especially compared to the other two). But the week has gone far too quickly and now I'm left with a fortnight of hard exams looming ominously over me... Ah yes, and I got a leather jacket.
