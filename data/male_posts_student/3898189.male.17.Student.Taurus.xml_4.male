(^_^)I am also staying the night (even though we really did not sleep at all) over one of meh best bud's house. (Theo) and it has felt like forever since we talked. So when I first arrived here I was really hyper. We are also planning to go to the mall with a bunch of people. That is going to be alot of fun cause I am going to see folk that I have not seen in a long time. ANYWAY! I have also been playing the game Legacy of Kain: Defiance. It is a really fun game. I have also recently played Qudditch on PS2 ( I have to buy it on XBOX!). Well that is really all I have to say for now...   (PS. It might be a while before I am going to post anything on acount that I do not know when the next time I am going to get on the computer is again... sorry) -_-      Checked by  urlLink Rhae
