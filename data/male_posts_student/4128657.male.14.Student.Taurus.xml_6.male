TO A TERRORIST   For the historical ache, the ache passed down which finds its circumstance and becomes the present ache, I offer this poem  without hope, knowing there's nothing,  not even revenge, which alleviates a life like yours. I offer it as one  might offer his father's ashes to the wind, a gesture when there's nothing else to do.   Still, I must say to you:  I hate your good reasons.  I hate the hatefullness that makes you fall  in love with death, your own included.  Perhaps you're hating me now,  I who own my own house  and live in a country so muscular,  so smug, it thinks its terror is meant only to mean well, and to protect.   Christ turned his singular cheek,  one man's holiness another's absurdity.  Like you, the rest of us obey the sting,   the surge. I'm just speaking out loud to cancel my silence. Consider it an old impulse,  doomed to become mere words.   The first poet probably spoke to thunder and, for a while, believed thunder had an ear and a choice.
