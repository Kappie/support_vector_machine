Everytime I open my mouth (which for me is often) my jaw hurts. Also I have been working on a stupid computer all morning. It isn't working and I'm not helping. I don't understand what's wrong, and I really don't care anymore. It is just bugging the heck out of me.   I'm in web-page design now. I am really bored! We are going over how to publish your site on  urlLink Geocities . As most of you know, I already know how to do it, in fact I have done it several times. I wish this teacher would let me do something. W00T I am helping out now. I think I will be used a lot in this class. Well, people already have their hands up.
