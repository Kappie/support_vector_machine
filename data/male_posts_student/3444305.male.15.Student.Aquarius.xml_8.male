If you don't like something I post, use the little X at the top right corner of the screen. And then all problems solved. Amazing right? If you have something to say though, you can comment on a post at the bottom. That would be cool if you did. Well, I have had a crappy day. The only good part of my day was the free chips I got in 0 hour. But the rest sucked. People suck or I suck either one. Who knows. I just feel lonely, I guess there is nothing I can do. I feel like every friend I have met this year is gone. I don't think I feel it, I think I know that they are gone. I tried to get one back, but I totally screwed that up. Oh well I must be annoying or something. I think I'm getting a cold or something. I don't feel to well. I have a whole bunch of homework to do and it's not gonna get down. Oh well only a week left right? Who needs finals? Then just two weeks off and then school again. Then camps all the way back to stupid school. This sucks... I'm not looking forward to anything. I'm gonna go listen to music. Maybe some Starting Line will cheer me up. Later.
