MR DEZ  is someone VERY VERY VERY Good in physics.. one day.. he's suffering from depression.. he found out that his life is meaningless (that's what he's been doing always).. he decided to kill himself.. but he doesn't have the gut.. (that's him, too).. so.. since he's so damn good in physics.. he decided to kill he younger self.. he made his decision to travel back time with a time machine that he'll create.. and kill his ownself 10 years ago... here's the catch.. AS soon as he made the decision.. he saw someone appears.. around the age of 28, looks like himself.. but a bit older.. holding a gun.. and shoot right into his head... he's dead  ok..  probably.. when mr dez decided to invent a time machine.. he's already making a starting point. mr dez spent 10 years inventing one.. and finally go back 10 years ago.. when he's 18.. and killed himself... now, tell me.. if he's murdered by himself at 18.. how come he can actually lived until 28 and created the time machine and go back 10 years later and killed his ownself?  now smarties, genuises and physicist wanna bes.. DO NOT EVER try to make a decision to create a time machine and go back kill yourself. Who knows.. you might see your older self appearing.. and kill you, now?  look behind you..
