On the way home, I came upon a traffic jam, slowed to a complete stop and pulled out a book. However, the words do not seem to draw my attention at this moment which result in me rotating the volume knob to the factory stereo. Head against the window, ambient pop music in the background, I stare out the window only to find seventeen blank cars with blank passengers surrounding me. The blank cars around me move three feet ahead all in attempts to cut eachother off and   Okay, boredom is not a good subject for concrete noun poetry. But heck this is a good way to write short stories, I'll have to finish that later. Here goes everything with a subject of anger.  He said "You're just not what we're looking for at this moment." Extra force is exerted to give a soft slam to the door closing behind me. Stepping out of the building, the red hot sun beats down on my face. In an attempt to cool down, I stop to eat at the local diner. Sitting down, the coarse wood seats tear at the very fibers of my skin. Accepting a menu from the waitress, the paper slices my fingers and large amounts of blood spill. Sucking on my fingers my attention is taken away to the three foot fires starting in the kitchen that spread to the furniture. I stay in my coarse seat, looking over the menu, sucking my blood, feeling the flames along with rejection to show the world my anger on the six o clock news.
