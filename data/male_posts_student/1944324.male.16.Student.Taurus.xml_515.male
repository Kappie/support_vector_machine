NBC greenlighting "Coupling" and "Whoopi": May 2002 The war in Iraq: March 2003 Sorkin leaving "The West Wing": May 2003 Terrorists deciding to invoke the wrath of a Republican President: September 2001 Paul spelling  Marten's   name wrong at Compendium of Stupidity: May 2004.  By the way, the titular speech is my persuasive speech, which I already posted on. I got the grade back and despite horrible horrible delivery, I still managed an 89. That's almost an A! Ha! What do you think of me now, suckas?   You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses  quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.
