Alright.....:D  So my parents are getting ready to leave for the trip around Canada...they'll be gone for 5 days, so tomor when I wake up...I'll be waking up to a empty house for 5 days...HOUSE PARTY!!!...nah.  err...the hand book issue was finally solved after some thinking and everyone seems to be happy...just hope it gets approved in time so I can print it...time is always against me...-_-  Remeber how I said in my post yester day that I can't take another server break down for the medias on the site?...well...it broke down...but this time for other reasons than computer bugs. It looks like our bandwith is being used a lot lately...and the 10GB bandwith was shot within 15 days. So now I can't log on to the server or do anything. We're on lock down for the rest of the month...-_-...oh well   Later Days...  "Why, Why do you keep going?" "Because I choose to"  Neo...
