There's a lot of wrong and disharmony in the world, a lot of puzzles of life to figure out, and if nothing at all I hope to use this forum to rant and share my various views, as inchorent, unconventional or inconclusive as they may be.   With that being said, I enter my first post:  My love for the Pistons runs deep which is why I've been on pins and needles all day today. Lots of people are Pistons fans nowadays, but I rooted for the pistons since back in the late 80's when the original bad boys had those heated playoff matchups with Jordan and the Bulls...this while living in Chicago. I actually watched the games when the Pistons dawned those nasty teal jerseys with Grant Long as our starting power forward and still remember what I was doing the day we lost Alan Houston and Grant Hill. So for me, tonight is kinda like the night I lost my virginity and prom night and the first night of college...well, not really, but you get my drift.  And I know how sports works. Just when you think you can dot your t's and cross your i's, conventional wisdom gets turned upsidedown and events akin to the splitting of the red sea seem to take place. Pistons fans got a taste of it in Game 2, which is why I fear that if the jugular is not fully severed tonight and LA wins, we could be in for a long and painful series. And it is Los Angeles, and if disney has taught us anything, its that miracles can happen and that animals can actually talk. Ultimately though I think that the Pistons as a team are noticably better and more cohesive as a unit, which is why i think they'll pull it off tonight. Being up 3-1 I think the pressure is now more so on Detroit, because history indicates that they are suddenly the favorites in the series now, so it will be interesting to see how they play.   All this Pistons success though begs the question, where is Hammer?   That's all i got for now.
