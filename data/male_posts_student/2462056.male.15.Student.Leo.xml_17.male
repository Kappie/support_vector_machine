I'm so happy!! Ah... okay, now that that's over, hehe.  Yeah today.... didn't do much, yet again! Hahah.  I finished reading  I, Robot , which was really really super good, and I'm glad I got it. Its kinda weird that they made a movie with the same title, and yet they aren't anything alike.. except there are robots... whatever, let those gay movie makers do what they want, because I still liked the movie.  Yeah my sister went over to her friends house for almost the whole day, so that was cool having the house to myself so I could blast music and stuff.  Man... what sucks about being done with english summerwork means I don't have an excuse for not working on history summerwork.... guess I'll have to get started on that.... poopee. Well! See ya!
