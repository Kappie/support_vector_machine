Would you like a traditional Guamish meal of Guamza and GuamCola? Or maybe you just want to watch me walk into Matt's see-through french doors, or perhaps watch Matt make an absurd noise and cause me to spit soda all over him... All highlights of our 10th grade french project. See the timeless story of Pierre LeTrec as his helicopter crash lands in Guam, inadvertently landing him right near his long lost cousin. What a captivating story. Starring Joe Puglisi and Matt Singer, written and translated by Joe Puglisi, taped and narrated by Mike Melita, edited by Matt Singer. Featuring Music by the Julliana Theory and the latest helicopter special effects. Stay after the credits for special only-seen-once-in-our-french-class bloopers. Now available on VHS.
