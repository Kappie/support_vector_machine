Why is it that Islam has utterly failed to produce a modern civilization anywhere in the world?  The only nation that is even close is Turkey, and that happened ONLY after they secularized their society and removed the power of the Mosque.  Why is it that every civilization with Islam as it's foundation is bathed in blood and suffering?  I heard the windbag Imus this morning wheezing about this bombing, going on and on about how it is a quagmire and Rumsfeld should be fired.  I wonder how Imus would feel about living in Jenin or Tel Aviv, where this happens at least once a month.  But Imus is a harsh critic of Ariel Sharon as well, so I guess he think's the Jews are to blame for thier own bombings.  I don't understand the Left.  Moral relativism and the inability to address the core issues will continue to perpetuate the slaughter.  How many people will die so that we can claim the moral high ground of 'respecting thier religion'?
