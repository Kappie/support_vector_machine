For me, one of those nightmares was the semester I had to take off from school because of my poor grades. And now, because of an ill-conceived 5 week summer class with a maximum of 2 overall assignments,  I might find myself facing that again.  Essentially right now, I'm not talking to anybody except my parents, and that's just because they live with me.  Otherwise...let me sort this out.
