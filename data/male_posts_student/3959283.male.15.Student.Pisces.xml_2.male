If you’ve ever listened to George Carlin you would know that he can be very rude, politically incorrect, offensive…but truthful.  Most people don’t care if you’re an ass just so long as you are truthful.  That’s all I wanna be.  I just wanna show people what’s going on in our society.  If it means that I have to call a few people a motherfucker, than so be it.  I wanna prove points.  I wanna make people think.  I wanna make people realize what kind of a fucked up world we live in.  Every one wants to control one another; everyone thinks they’re right…when most of the time they are wrong.  I wanna be an ass.  People tend to recognize the assholes more than the good people.  When they find out about someone who has done something good they say, “Hey did you hear about the guy who cured AIDS,” the other guy says “yeah that’s pretty cool…you wanna go have some lunch?”  And they never talk about him again.  But when there is an asshole people get pumped full of energy.  People get angry and argue with one another.  They begin debating the things that the person has talked about.  Look at George W. Bush.  He is probably the worlds biggest, asshole/idiot in the world right now.  He has made so many mistakes.  People don’t just say “HEY…THIS GUYS AN ASSHOLE…what’s for dinner?”  People don’t do that.  They talk about assholes.  They talk about what the asshole has done wrong, and how they think they could fix it.  They begin to think about what they could do to make the world a better place.  You don’t think about something that has been done right, because all the thinking has already been done.  It would be just pointless.  I mean you can’t argue a good thing.  I mean you couldn’t argue a cure to aids, you couldn’t say, “Damn, now all those fuckers in Africa are gonna live!”  I mean you just don’t say those things, its just wrong.  But now if a president said that, that would get people thinking.  It would people thinking about what an asshole our president is, and it would be an endless cycle.
