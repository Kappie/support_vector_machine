Then the woman conducting the meeting told me that when he contacted the school, he asked specifically to speak to me, and then she gave him the names of the other kids (the juniors) and they're participating too.  I suppose it's pretty insignificant but it definitely feels great that people are noticing my hardwork, especially people from top educational institutions.
