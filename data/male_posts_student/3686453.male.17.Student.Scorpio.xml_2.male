It was cool, awesome, loved the Superman ride which I waited an hour in line so I could get the front seat, but the real agenda (I love words like that) is the fact that I got back from my job interview at BOCES about an hour and a half ago.  The interview went well I thought, not really sure because this was my first one, but when I got home after making a few stops my brother told me they had called.  I called the guy back and he said "I can offer you a position if you are still interested."  Yes!  My first job!  Well, besides working for my dad.  That doesn't count.  But... got a job.  So, steps that need to be done:   1. Repay my dad for all the money that I borrowed from him over the school year.   2. Acquire a decent joystick ( Logitech Wingman Digital Extreme  rocks!) 3. I want to play Icewind Dale.  Get those games.  Oh, and Planetscape: Torment. 4. I've been GMing a SWRPG game with two of my younger brothers.  Get that rolling again. 5. Get my drivers license.  Test is tomorrow, practice... now, actually  Signing off to practice for my drivers test...
