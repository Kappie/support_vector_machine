Heres the text from  urlLink Slashdot.org :  Both  urlLink The Guardian  and  urlLink BBC News  are carrying the story that two students at the  urlLink University of Oxford , Patrick Foster and Roger Waite, were able to easily hack into the university's internal network in minutes using only easily-available software. Once inside, they could find out anyone's email password, observe instant messenger conversations and control parts of the university's CCTV system. The students were investigating the university's network security for the student newspaper,  urlLink The Oxford Student , which published a  urlLink front page article  and  urlLink editorial  on the matter. In the article, a university spokesperson is quoted as saying 'In some cases the wish to provide the widest possible computer access as cheaply as possible may mean deciding to go for a cheaper set-up, with potentially lower security.' The students now face disciplinary precedings from the university and could receive rustication (suspension) and a 500 pound fine. The matter has also been passed onto the police. I hope you enjoyed that! BUT... in other news, today will showcase the SciFi Channel premier of the highly anticipated Stargate Atlantis. I can't wait... Tomarrow I'll let you know whether the first episode (the pilot) lives up to all the hype. Untill then... Adios.
