I tALked about how students shouldn't just vote for their friends or for someone with an amusing campaign gimmick, that I support the pluses and minuses grading system, that locker graffiti is an important part of the school's culture, and that random locker searches are unconstitutionAL. I ended with saying that I would protect your liberties as students, then "My name is Alexander Dietz, and I'm running for Student Faculty Administration!" something I 'borrowed' from The West Wing.  I think the speech was generally well-received. In contrast to others, I actuALly DELVED into the issues, and not just praised myself. Afterward, many people I would not have thought would vote for me said they would. Whadayaknow.  In closing, Alexander Dietz for Student Faculty Administration. Intelligent leadership for your school.
