"Could you be more specific?" "Well. Me,personally, Id like to kill a dragon."  I like how Angel ended. =)  Smallville, on the other hand was messed up. What the hell was with the bomb? And when (and how) the hell did Jor-El come back? I havent watched this show in so long that I guess some of this makes sense, but im missing it. Chloe was far, far hotter then Lana is. I cant believe this shit.... Who the hell kills that great of a character? Fucking horrible writers. Messing up Superman....
