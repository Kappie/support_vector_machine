It seems that Al now has a new drinking hole, so feel free to call him trifecta, and YES Al, it is a dive bar. Wednesday is the celebatory day for the birth of G-Unit, all eyes will be mainly on Al and Joe. Can they actually be up and somewhere before noon? We shall see. Its all about guppy bonding in newport harbor and capping it off most likley at the yardhouse in pasadena. Also, there are new developments surrounding the possible guppy house. The target date seems to be january 2005. Can Joe, Al, Danny and Gerrit co-exist under the same household? Looks like it would be a great reality show. No big panties allowed! Stay tuned for updates and future developments, but until then lets all get together and have some fun wednesday with the whole crew, Danny, Al, Joe, Adrian, Ruben, Veronica, Edgar, Me, and of course Luke and Lisa. Lookin forward to some good ol scratchin and burping with the guys and lets see who tosses his cookies first, Gerrit or Al?Later, G-Unit
