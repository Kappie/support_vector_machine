GOSH!  and geez i finished all my homework so i cant go do any of that...hahaha!  im pretty happy though...things are very nice right now.  im somewhat relaxed.  rather odd.  i cant wait for this weekend.  dunno what im gonna be doin...anybody got any ideas?!  yes well its 9:14...i dont wanna go to bed but i got nothin better to do...so i guess ill just stay up for a bit.  i probably wont even go to sleep till like 11 or 12.  its hard for me to fall asleep.  course it's easier when Marbles is in my bed.  i dont like to be alone.  its a whole bunch easier to sleep when she's around.  of course she takes up a ton of space and then i wish she wasnt there and then when she leaves im like "no come back"...hahaha...im so messed up!  im a picky little child.  anyways.  i think im gonna go find somethin to do.  ttyl.  bye.
