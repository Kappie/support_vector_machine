Other than that, I have done nothing but watch the Used DVD, and a movie...The Rules Of Attraction, also, still playing in my room. I came upstairs for a drink and planned on going back down there, but that was half an hour ago.  Phaedra and Kylie should be calling soon, although I don't know if anything will come of that, as the roads are mundo shitty. If you haven't figured, I hate winter. I hate having my birthday in the winter, I hate having friends in the winter, I hate working in the winter, and I hate being in the winter. I would rather fall out of existence for 5 months of the year than have to drudge through all the snow and wind and cold. This is not the last time I will complain about winter.   sometimes cold nights are all we need, everyone wants someone to hold
