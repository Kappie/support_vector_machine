      Yo yo yo, bowling motherfuckers.  Our scores all stayed pretty consistently low.  The highest score of the night was Jeremy's 117.  I stayed pretty consistent, I probably averaged about 90. (I only broke 100 once.)  We were all pretty bad.  It was good to have Glenn, Ryan, Jeremy, and Matt all together.  A nice little going-away thing.  And we got to see someone carried away on a stretcher.  Good times.
