What I'm feeling right now musically is (once again in no particular order):  1)U2-Beautiful Day....just a good song in general....U2 is a hella good group....  2)Deon Estus  George Michael-Heaven Help Me.....another one of those songs I love because I can relate to it....  3)Lil Will feat. Cool Breeze-Lookin For Nikki.....This is an ATL classic....if you ain't from the A-Town you wouldn't understand.....  4)Destiny's Child-Dangerously In Love.....Yep I still like it....it will soon approach Faith "Soon As I Get Home" and Guy "Lets Chill" status....  5)Stevie Wonder-Rocket Love.....not so much about love anymore to me....it's life.....  Now about my life....I just don't know....I try to do the best I can to shake these blues and I just can't.....I have given serious thought to seeing a shrink because I know that I have all of the symptoms of clinical depression....when I think about it I have been depressed long before my dad got sick but I was able to hide it a little better....I think my Aunt Lynn's funeral was a real big breaking point for me....I lost it about three distinct times....I just don't know what the deal is....I've been escaping to Black Planet alot lately....hiding my pain behind my chat ID....I haven't been studying and I don't really want to....this has been a problem for 2 months now....something has got to give....
