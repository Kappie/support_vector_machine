And then another friend made collect calls to the house and the racked up to $48 and I thought that they were only 5 cents a minute when they weren't and now they're on the bill and she has to pay that * how am I suppose to know how much every single collect call company charges?* and now I'm getting my phone taken away because of this bullshit and it's really fucked up and it irritates the fuck out of  me. Well there goes my social life because the only way that most of my friends and I communicate is by the means of phone and in person and if you take the phone away then how am I gunna be able to get help on my homework if they know how to do it and I don't how am I gunna be able to go places with them if I can't get in touch with them? that's just a bunch of bullshit unless I go over to one of they're houses I'm not gunna get help from my friends and if she takes away the phone then I'll just be spending more time with them after school to do my work since I can't talk to them on the phone. so  OOOOOO and yeah I just feel like I wanna throw my tv, bed, and computer out of my window right now I'm so mad.I don't think that I've ever been this mad. THANX GRAMS YER THE BEST!!!!!!!!!! sorry about the sarcasm and swearing but that's how I feel although I love my grams to death this really ticks me off!!
