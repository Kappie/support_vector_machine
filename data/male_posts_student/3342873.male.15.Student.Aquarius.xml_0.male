We start the race with Panis stalling his car, before he gets into position. This results in a restart. Finally, we get back into position, and the race begins again. Panis stalls his car for a second time, but the team manages to get the car into the pit lane, and he subsequently starts from there. During the second start, Sato manages to fly off the line (which some say was before the lights went out...) and clips Schumi, forcing the Red Dragon back into 5th place. Klien puts himself out of the race at Loews. (Which is odd, with it being the slowest corner in Formula 1 .... This leaves 19 on the track) The first few laps are relatively uneventful, with Renault in position 1 and 2. (Yes.....) There's some weird smoke coming out of the back of Sato's Honda, but they think it's just an overfill of oil. In lap 3, Sato's car gives up all hope, and a burst of smoke bellows out of the rear, covering the entire track and bringing the race to a near stand-still. Sato is out. (Leaving 18 on the track) To clear the smoke, Fisichella decides to use Coulthard's McLaren as a ramp and succeeds .... in landing upside down against the barrier. Fisichella and Coulthard are out of the race. (Leaving 16 in the race) The next 2 and a half laps are under the safety car.  The race is fairly uneventful until lap 13, when Webber rolls to a stop. (This leaves 15) Lap 15 ... Pantano has an oddly long pit-stop, only to come out and have his car blow up on him. (This drops us to 14 on the track) Bruni pits in lap 19 and doesn't come back out again. (This leaves us with 13). Raikkonen pits for a long time in lap 30. Pulls away, but then seems to change his mind, and retires instead. (We now have 12 on the track, people) Lap 43 comes along and Alonso decides to use his Renault to clean the wall on the exit of the tunnel. (Dammit, Alonso....) He fails hopelessly in his cleaning efforts, but succeeds in giving Ralph the finger while his car is still spinning. (That's my boy...) (We now have 11 on the track) Safety car ..... again. Everybody decides to pit ... except for Ferrari. (Oh, that's smart...) Lap 46. Safety car is still out. Schumi is in P1.  They go through the tunnel. Schumi decides that Alonso didn't do a good enough cleaning job inside the tunnel, so decides to lend a helping hand. (Or a helping left-front tire...) That puts the world champ out. (leaving us with 10) Ralph, pits in lap 73, (for the 3rd time) and, not wanting to leave his brother in the lurch, persuades his car to blow up. (Down to 9, which is where we stay ... at last) The final 3 laps were really suspensful (for me, anyway ... my Renault's in the lead), what with Button driving so well. Finally, it's all over.  Trulli takes his first ever win.  Button is right behind him, in second. Third place man is Barrichello, who is ........ almost an entire lap behind........ The rest of the runners are all more than a lap behind. (Hey, it's not often that you can be more than a lap behind and still be in fourth place...)  All-in-all, one of the strangest things I've seen in a while. But I loved every minute. (If only for the sheer comedic value...)  Let's hope we can have the same kind of action at the European GP next week.  See you guys there..........
