They just can't come out and praise anything as long as Bush is involved.  I saw a poll somewhere that had some interesting data.  58% of Democrats supports a "US effort to return to the moon and go to Mars."  The same pollers then changed the question to "Do you support the Bush Plan to return to the moon and go to Mars."  The supporters dropped to 30%.  Nice to know the true motivations of people.
