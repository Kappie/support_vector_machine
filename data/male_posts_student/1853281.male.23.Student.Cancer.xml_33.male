It would be cooler if i had consumption, than i could write poetry in a dark garret while remaining ever mindfull of my approaching mortality. Or maybe rickets... or scurvy again Argh matey!!  in other news i emailed my new favorite sci fi author, well, basically my new favorite author period,  urlLink Alastair Reynolds  and he so e-mailed me back. I am way to excited about this. Almost as excited that i am now fitting into smaller pants. Hooray. Tonight i am going to a play about mathew shepard at mctc. I think. I am not quite sure if i will go yet. Otherwise am looking forward to the weekend and glad all my midterms are done. I got my medieval cities midterm back, an a- ah yeah baby!! cheers d
