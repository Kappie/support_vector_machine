"With my absence for the next 7 days beginning Friday,  JR Ganzon  will be maintaining the blog." He went on to later declare that "no strike or resignation is in the forseeable future."  This is excellent news to all  Three Eye Witnesses  readers, because it will ensure at least that the blog remain around just a little bit longer. The statement came after 53 minutes that  Brown  announced an impending strike or resignation. That strike was avoided today with a short talk with  Three Eye Witnesses Corporation  writer, J.R. Ganzon, about  Brown's  upcoming leave of absence.  A formal statement from  Mr. Brown  is expected around 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday, August 13th on the  Three Eye Witnesses  website.
