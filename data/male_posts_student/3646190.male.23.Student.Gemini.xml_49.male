I cant describe the experience clearly but it has been a measure of how I have developed politically. Lot of kids younger than me asking a lot of good questions. But a lot of older folks disagreeing with me as well…  Way too damn tired to write much else… gotta be back at the conference at 9am tommorow….  Hmm….
