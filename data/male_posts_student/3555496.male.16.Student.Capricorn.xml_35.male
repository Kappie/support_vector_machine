That's right baby, it was raining cats and dogs. I thought it was refreshing, until most (all) of the girls started nipping, then it just got ugly. Yeah, all the hot girls were in the gym twirling flags and the ooglay ones were outside with us. Then some lucky/brave freshman chump got in TROUBLE for grabbing some girl's rack. Yeah he ran a lap and then we voted him off the island. It got ugly, and it got ugly quick. They let us out early, so I'm glad I don't have to go back for the 1-5.  I was walking back from Alan's house after eating some pizza for lunch yesterday and I found  this  AWESOME watch. It was in the street near the 9th grade campus, so I was like YOINK! Yes, it really is purple like the one in the picture. But at least now I can stop asking people for the time. Some freshman is crying his/her eyes out looking for their watch right now.  Well, today is FRIDAY kids! You must know what that means! THE VILLAGE! That's what I'm talkin' about. I need to see that mess tonight. I just hope that it doesn't have some wack ending  urlLink like  Signs  did . That whole "alien-coming-out-of-nowhere-and-shooting-my-son" thing didn't fly with me. The Village looks cooler anyway.
