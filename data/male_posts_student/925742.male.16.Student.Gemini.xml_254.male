It turns out that I'm apparently a natural at it.  I wasn't surprised.    >:^O  Hahahaha, I love that face.  So then I got to use the big, riding mower.  Like you sit and drive it.  And then I put it away.  I was thinking about making a small weeks worth of comics called 'Grand Theft Mower' or 'Grand Theft Storage Units'.  I need a name for that.  It would be funny... get Alex to polish it  up a bit.  Whatever you guys want, really.    So as I was leaving... Gary was like, "You hungry?"  And of course I hadn't eaten yet.  So I was like "YEAH!"  So he hands me a chicken. Like.... A rotissorie chicken, whole, in like those plastic things you pick cooked chicken up at the store.  Just... hands it to me.  So I started eating it in the car, bare hands.   Now I'm still munching on this scrumptious chicken; with a fork, of course.  Hahaha, it rules.  Ok, I guess thats it.  Oh, do you really want a 'Driving Nazi' shirt?  I could probably make one or something.  That would be hilarious.
