So we are gonna go and hit balls on the range and I'm gonna teach him to putt and he is gonna teach me how to hit irons. I'm not very good at irons, but DAMN, I'm good at putting. I got a 51, which is kinda bad for a Par 3 course, but atleast I was consistant. Anywayz. Jamison hasen't posted anything yet, but he might. I wonder how he felt with my parents drinking beer while golfing. I dunno if he felt okay with them doing it. If you wern't Jamison, I apologize, but that is how they are. They are really cool though! :-P I love em! Well, enough from me. I know it isn't a page like my last long one was, but oh well. Close enough, right?
