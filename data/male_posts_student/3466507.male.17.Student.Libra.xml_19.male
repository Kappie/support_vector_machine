Heehee.  Today, I let my bad side get the upper side of me because I was very tired. Luckily, it didn't manage to show itself much, only towards the end of the evening. I'm better now, and the good side has regained control again, haha.... Anyway, i didn't really lash out at anyone because i felt that it would be unfair to the person if I just scolded him/her because I was in a bad mood. It managed to avoid me scolding and blasting a few people every now and then, luckily. Well well, what do you know, Vincent has a bad side too, you might think, but I'm only human. What you expect from me??? Of  course I have my ups and downs, and I think I am entitled to a black face now and then, but certainly not simply scolding other people.  I believe that each person has his/her abilities and disadvantages. I have my own EXTREMELY unique, or in other words, weird, way of dealing with stress. I will become very childish or just go crazy. It is so relieving to act childish coz when you are a child, you actually have less pressure on you(though I am not so sure about children nowadays...) so I feel the pressure lifted off me, haha.... You might want to try my way if you are willing to risk people labelling you as crazy or wacko. Frankly, I don't care much about certain comments people make, although i do care about some important ones. Well, it's my life anyway.
