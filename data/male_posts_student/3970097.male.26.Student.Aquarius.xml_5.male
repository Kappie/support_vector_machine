Yep..!! we are gonna crack some fires, rush up or do something like that. I am not really used to this, been doing that in my boyhood, but then there was the age of maturity or rather must say, didnt have much time to waste as used to. It'll be the same fireworks sight on independence day, like we witness on Australia Day, January the 26th. Fire rocking in the capital, over the parliament house here in Islamabad, a spectacular sight to see every year..lots of people around and it gets hard to drive by on the raods, you know what I mean? Last night was hell boring. Nothing was in favor, i got my pc fixed, then i checked with the internet and it didnt work, someone took the cable off the switcxhes and as the switches were tightly secured, i was unable to get my fingers in there to get the cables back in place,, so me and my brother, we spend the whole night playing video games, eventaully ended up one which was quiet boring. Its been with me for the past 7 years now that I cant sleep before 3 o clock in the morning. i got this bad habit from Australia where i used to work late and then end up reaching home late hours in the night and leave home early next morning for work again. That was quiet fun too and as well as painful sometimes, as i felt like not doing anything. Weather is really lagging here now a days. Had rains few days back and now again the same old Humidity prevails...Gosh, when we gonna get over it? I know its gonna stick with us till end of October but I'm aint in a position to wait that long. I always hated summer, it always brings so many things with it I hate to do. For instance, taking shower like countless times in a day,sweat, smell, yuck..!! forgive me what am I talking here.?? I decided to go out and see a pal whom i long visited, and i was told at the gates that I cant do that just now because mom wanna take me somewhere with her. Hmmm, hows it gonna be, Im just wondering..... Aite, heres the call..i gotta run now peeps...Oi, stick around me mates...i wanted to share few things with u guys, and will do that later when i return. you know I'll always return..
