Hokai. Soh. I went to the Bahamas, met some kick ass Bahamians, and went to Fepcot. That is one sweet trip you might say. YES!  (Horray for accents edition!)  Thursday, 2/12 Went to the airport, got in the plane. USAIR flight 9021whothefuckcares0.   Friday, 2/13 Today really was fun. We went to bed at about 1:00 in the AM, so I was a little sleepy after a day of travel. We traveled via PEGAUS! bus lines to Port Canaveral. On the way, we met Dennis, our cruise director. When we arrived at the boat, I was pretty amazed by its size. 3 football fields long (Duh, 100 yards x 3), featured a rock wall to climb, probably a dozen bars, lounges and entertainment places (though few band members were thoroughly entertained here).  We got these cool little cards to put money on, credit card style. A few people I was with figured that the cruise line uses them to keep us from knowing how much we spend on Pina Coladas. Before we got on the boat, they took our picture so when our card got scanned they knew it was us. Annoying and cool! For a boat 3 fb fields long, you'd think the rooms would be vast. If you do think this, however, you are mistaken. The room was 7' x 7'. The bathroom was 4.5' x 2'. The shower was shitty, because drying required a degree in Kama Sutra. It also smelled in there, because they used sea water for the toilet. The same goes for the pool, which, I was told, used sea water. I decided not to use the pool because there were too many mullet-wearing rednecks on board with hairy, fat stomachs.  We ran through a drill on getting to our "muster stations". I learned how to use the life-vest's clippy things that is on just about, oh say, EVERY FUCKING PIECE OF CLOTHING. The loud-speaker lady invited us to a "pahtehy". I translated her ridiculous aussie accent to mean there was some sort of merriment going down on the poop deck. I skipped it.  We ate lots of food.  Saturday, 2/14 The boat landed in Nassau in the mid-morn.  "This is you captain, Captain Grimstad. We have arrived in Nasshau. (this was said extremely fast. try it. it's fun!) The temperature in Nasshau is a balmy *aetie-two deegrees forenhite*." We repeated this over and over. At least until we set foot on the island, where we got a quote never to be forgotten. This came from a rotund Bahamian woman, just outside of the building tourists had to pass through. She was trying to get us to take a bus tour through the city. "Be amazed by steeng rays, monta raes, eegle raeys, shaaks, and ova fowtee thousand varieties of tropeecal feesh! See whea the reech leeve, ahnd whea the poors live!" We didn't go on the bus. The idea of shaaks didn't sound fun. We did manage to work our way over to the public beach. Dan, Guy, Gorch, and I swam for a good 25 minutes. From the water, I was sure no one would try to hustle me. I could see Issac being tricked into buying the same puca shell neclace for $10 that every stand in the market had for 3/$1. All of a sudden... "Do you want to go to da white wall, mon?" (what the fuck is wrong with those people? do they think they are Jamaican?) "Uhh, huh?" (from another swimmer) "I don't think they have enough balls to go to da white wall, mon!" I looked around and realized the white wall was a piece of formed cement that people were jumping off of. This guy was actually trying to hustle me into taking me to a public WALL to jump! I didn't go, but realize now that jumping from that wall would have been a life changing experience.  We shopped around, I got some goods. You know what I mean.  We returned to the boat after only a few short but memorable hours on the island of Nasshau.  Sunday, 2/15 This day was weird. We played for Dennis, who we were learning more and more about. Not only was he our cruise director, but he held equipment in his room, arranged for instruments and a concert on-deck, is the president of the company, and arranges to have about 90 other bands sail yearly. Damn. We earned "superior", out of a possible "good", "excellent", and "superior". I even got a sweet trophy for "Outstanding Soloist". We spent much of the day on the cruise line's private island. The pronunciation is still being hotly debated. Dennis said that even though it is spelled "Cococay," it is actually pronounced "Coco-key". Everyone on the boat, including our captain, Captain Grimstad, pronounced it "Coco-kay". The island was a little too perfect - you know. Man-made-esque. I had no problem with that though. I swam in the crystal blue waters for 4 hours. I think I heard it was snowing in Boston that day. Suckas.  When we returned to the boat, a "Weather System" was moving in. We played for a few boat riders, but the wind almost stymied our efforts.   Monday, 2/16 Our hotel had some computer problem so we stayed outside by the hot tub soaking our feet. It was really nice sitting with a dozen friends in the Floridian sun. We cracked jokes. Fun. We went to the Hard-Rock Cafe in (announcer style voice) Universalstudiosorlandoflorida. The food was "eh", and when they say hard rock, they mean Yanni. I didn't get to ride any rides due to time constraints, but I had a great time going in the stores and listening to performers. I bought a NASCAR cafe hat here for only $5.   Tuesday, 2/17 On this day, we visited Epcot, or as jazz band members called it, "Fepcot." The food here was really great. It was also in abundance. Ten points for D-nizzle.  The problem with this park is the lack of fast shit. I went on that "amazing" and "realistic" mission to Mars ride. Maybe if you were on acid or something. The line was too long for a 1 minute ride like that. I couldn't get to test track, but I heard it was great. Next time. I rode spaceship earth 4 times and the Monorail/Fonofail 3 times. One time I actually fell asleep and drooled. Ha ha, Yes! We returned to the Hohtehl. Lights were out by "11".  Wednesday, 2/18 We were out of that hohtehl by 6:45 AM. We landed in Boston at 3:00 PM. I don't remember much of what happened, as I was tired.  Less sooner. Ex pax.
