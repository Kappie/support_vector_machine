Future lines will attempt to be well intentioned and honest, hoping that my distorted, spoiled, ungrateful, and often selfish perception of the world bears with them. “Seasoned Happenings” start crying, start breathing, start looking around you and within yourself, start smiling, and start sobbing.  Live.
