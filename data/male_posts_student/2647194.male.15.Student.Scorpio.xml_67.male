Wasn't too thrilled about that.  2. Did homework, so now I have nothing hanging over my head for the rest of the weekend.  3. Tuned up my Orbea road bike, so now its in semi-working order. I put eletrical tape on the handlebars instead of cushy handlebar tape to save weight (every gram counts in a race), checked the brakes, gears, raised the seat, ect. The only thing left that I can't do is to true the rear wheel-its pathetic.  4. Went on a little bike ride around St. Paul Park to random streets w/Dylan. We happened to see about 3-4 random idiot kids bashing Wal-mart brand guitars on the ground and basically making a racket in the park. idiots...and they wouldn't race against me. They'd get their asses kicked anyhow.  5. Decided not to do anything tonight, and spend Good Friday evening at home, relaxing. Watched Now, with Bill Moyers on PBS at 9:00, had a cup o' tea.  6. Thoroughly routed my father in a game of scrabble, 329-293, a quite sizable win.  7. Planning to watch Conan O'Brien, and yes, have another cup o' tea. Hmm...maybe I should get some scones. That's about the only thing I'm missing in my whole "Englishman" personality. Tea, London-Lingo, killer accent...  That's pretty much it, except the part of me sitting in my room listening to loud music. lol. Thank God my parents weren't home today.  And yes, my memory is leaving me for a better place, probably the Bahamas so it doesn't have to pay property tax on the business (erm...not funny). Yep, its early alzheimer's-my gray matter is already starting to decay. And yes, I did forget that there is no Underground this weekend. AGAIN! Despite desperate reminders and evening myself saying there isn't. What am I going to do when I'm 40?  So no Underground this weekend, as it is Easter Vigil. No Underground. No Underground. No Underground...so I might shoot pool play halo, or stay home because I have a stupid sore throat. Colds suck.  Oh. Amanda: I will be attending Zion Lutheran on Sunday, and yes, I'll be wearing a suit. lol.  Well, I'm off to go watch Conan. Better than Leno, better than Letterman, its Conan!
