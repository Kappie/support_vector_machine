Thanks you guys for helping me with my poems...lol for those of you who actually commented (cough Lara cough), your comments were really fantastic.  Thanks so much!  And your poem...(trying to think of perfect word here)...wow.  That's all I can think of to say right now.  You know?    Anyways...I don't actually know if it's based purely on the writing or on performance...I'd guess that it's based on the writing since there are other performing categories...but I really don't know!    Gracias, señors/señorita!!  SQEE!
