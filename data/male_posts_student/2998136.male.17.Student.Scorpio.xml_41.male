Surprised to see that you have been checking my blog out in a regular basis, I am quite glad. Because this shows that someone's been reading my blog loyally, and is interested in my daily life.  I love to make enemies and you are the only one who dares to make enemy with me, I am truly impressed. I am a Scorpio, so you know what's the consequences of being enemy with me? I suggest why not you create a blog called "Xing Yi Sucks" or "I hate Xing Yi"? And you can comment whatever bad things to everyone out there? Call me son of a bitch, gay, horny bastard or what, you say it all.  Ok, maybe you are just trying to express your love towards me. Just that you do it in a nasty way just to bring attention to me. I now get what you are thinking and understand how you feel.  So I am gonna make you Xing Yi's enemy of the year and award you with a grand prize. Please reveal your name, gender, home address and contact number so that I can contact you to collect the prize or deliver the prize to your doorstep. But I know you are not gonna be so stupid to tell me your particulars, so I am gonna choose a location and time to leave the prize there for you to collect.  The location is at my school, ITE MacPherson. This coming Monday, I will put the prize into the rubbish bin which is infront of I-net cafe entrance at 12 noon sharp before I leave for class. To protect your identity, please collect the prize after I leave for about 5 minutes time. Remember to collect it or else you have to search it in the rubbish chute.  I got to go....
