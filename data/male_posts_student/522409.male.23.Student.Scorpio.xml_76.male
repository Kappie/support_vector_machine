Anyway, I'm updating because, as Allison very astutely observed (and I agreed, before I knew what she was getting at), December 10th was a long time ago.  Surely stuff has happened since then, right?  Right.  I got a chance to go hang out with Jess's family for a little while a couple days after Christmas.  Talked to her mom and dad for a while, met their new dog, got bitten by the new dog... Do I need any more signs?  heh...  But it was really nice to see them and talk to them.  I haven't done either in so long.  Am still making Christmas present for the girl who never goes away.  I figure I've already missed Christmas and New Years (thanks, finals.  thanks, Mary and your stupid project), so why rush now?  I'm also redecorating my room at my apt... painting, adding new furniture and decorations and all that good stuff.  I reorganized all the furniture in my room on New Year's Eve, which was the beginning of the redecorating.  New year, new point of view.  The moving of the furniture made for a really funny New Year's morning experience when my roommate Steph rolled into my room wasted to wish me a happy new year.  She opened the door and started walking toward where my bed used to be and fell on top of me, lying in my bed where it is now.  I woke up, startled and a little drunk still, wondering who this girl with the purple wig who just jumped in bed with me was.  Confusion proceeded when said girl kissed me and wished me happy new year.  Ah.  It's you, Steph.  Happy new year. :)  Nice, though, being awakened by hot roomie falling in your bed and kissing you.  Difficult to complain.  The last couple days have been really low key, as days in New Hampshire inevitably are.  Got a call from Yvette today who asked me to help her work on a jazz piece because she's going to be SINGING WITH LES FUCKING PAUL SOON.  Singing with friggin' Les Paul.  Jeez, I sure wish I had something like that to worry about.  She also let me know that she's sending in her Berklee app tomorrow.  How exciting.  She belongs here.  She's not meant to be a music teacher.  She's meant to be a music doer.  It's in her veins... UMass Lowell just ain't cutting it.  Welcome to heaven, Yvette.  I'm very near giddy about returning to school in a couple weeks.  Only thing I'm nervous about is getting charts done for the Berklee Method.  Set's gonna be ridiculous, but I've gotta get the damn thing on paper, or it's not gonna be much of anything.  Katie Bank is my hero, and the best acamanager on the planet.  Sister jut hooked me up with a workshop at Cornell, a series of workshops at Harvard, an arrangement at Harvard, and a possible CD production gig at Bowdoin.  Holy phatness.  Katie, you're the shit.  I also got a call from Katrina today.  Katrina is the only person on the planet who I'll admit comes really close to understanding me.  It's amazing... and a little comforting.  Which is why I wish she hadn't moved to LA, because I miss her a lot.  (If she reads this, she'll tell me I'm being an idiot because we've never been in the same place anyway)  It's too bad she had people in the car, because I'd have liked to talk to her a lot longer... and without my mother in the same room as me, because I'm sure as hell not gonna talk about the girl who never goes away with my mother in my room.  The girl had my mother for freshman english in high school, after all.  It's also unfortunate that she let me talk the whole time, as I'd rather know what's going on with her and her new boy.  Why do you all need to know this?  Gah.  In 2004, I resolve to exercise discretion when writing in my blog.  Which implies that I'm resolving to write in my blog, too.  Enough from me.  More to come at a later date.  And believe me, there's plenty more.
