All I have been doing is driving around trying to prepare for my 2nd driving test on Thursday, after getting 6 majors (yes that's SIX! majors) in my last test. Seemed alright till monsoon season came and I was left attempting to drive in 4 inches of water which isn't an easy task. The only other thing I've had to do to fill in these empty hours is arrange my racket matches against the 3rd member of Wham, Daniel Shilley, in preparation for my thrashing by Tom (despite the fact he hasn't played in 2 years).   I don't wanna talk   If it makes you feel sad   And I understand   You've come to shake my hand   I apologize   If it makes you feel bad   Seeing me so tense   No self-confidence   But you see   The winner takes it all
