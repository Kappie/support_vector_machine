Saturday........baritones should not post about saturday morning because negative things might be said. man o man lots of pain. But, that was a good thing, because it showed us what level we are actually at because there was no where to run or hide. Good learning experience. The rest of the day was not as hard, but trying to recover from the hardest, most ungodly block in one hour is kinda hard, especially since one must eat during that hour. Sunday, soreness; takin Motrin like M's. on the way to SF my butt fell asleep so that just added to the wonderfulness, me and kendall were dying. The performance....ok, i you put aside all the stuff that was awful it wasnt that bad. it was loud, and what people did play sounded reasonable didnt it? all things considered we did the best we could and im sure it could have gone worse.    If ya think about it it was a pretty good weekend, we learned a lot; about ourselves if not the show hehe. I think this was a good weekend and would not change any of it.   Hey, i got a nice tan so even better right?
