There's something awesome about Chinese people -- I just got kicked out of my nice spacious seat to spend the rest of the bus ride by people I don't know in the back entirely because of two elderly Asian ladies (Yeah, I couldn't really refuse...my mom and dad were in the next seat over and there's this whole "respect your elders" Asian culture thing). The tour guide just gave us an introduction in a heavy latino accent which I very much doubt anybody here understood, but at least they did make good use of the phrase "Thank you", which is perhaps the only shred of English they know. I love America.
