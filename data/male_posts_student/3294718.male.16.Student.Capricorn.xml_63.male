My new LIST IS: "Johnny Quest Thinks We're Sellouts" "Morning Star" "Kids and Heroes" "Boys On the Docks"  Yay   If  the list was expanded to 5 songs each, I would definately add "The Ballad of Johnny X."  It seems Mattson already has one of those songs. Sooo... my new list is: "Johnny Quest Thinks We're Sellouts" LTJ "Kids and Heroes" Bouncing Souls "Boys On the Docks" DKM "Gone" Bouncing Souls  But I really want to have "The Ballad of Johnny X" in there too though...  **EDIT**  God, I can't stand it. New list: "Johnny Quest Thinks We're Sellouts" LTJ "Kids and Heroes" Bouncing Souls "Boys On the Docks" DKM "The Ballad of Johnny X"
