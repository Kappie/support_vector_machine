In her smug, sanctimonious tone, she explains why Michael Powell, Chair of the FCC should not do a thing about Janet Jackson, but Colin Powell, the father, should revolt against his own president and strive to topple the Iraq policy.  "Rummy stuck to his Orwellian guns, telling Congress yesterday that just because we don't find the weapons doesn't mean they're not there."  I guess when Eric Rudolph eluded law enforcement for what, four years in the Carolinas, he didn't really exist at all since he could not be found.  Is she really this stupid?  "The younger Powell failed to appreciate the consequences of not curbing big media companies gobbling up rivals. Colin Powell failed to appreciate the consequences of not curbing Dick Cheney, Rummy and Wolfie as they gobbled up foreign policy."  The costume malfunction is a result of media merger?  And I'd like to see a SecState try to curb the VP.    It's the same old thing with her.  Setting the standard so high that we will never be able to defend ourselves until we've already been hit hard.  My only hope is that she can directly experience the consequence of the course of action she advocates.
