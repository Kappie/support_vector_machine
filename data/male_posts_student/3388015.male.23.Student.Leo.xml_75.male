The move went smoothly and we had a lovely barbecue at his new place. It was so great to be without those heinously rude, selfish, uptight, Elmyra roommates. I played with CindyVacaCat all night long and my allergic reactions were amusing. I am allergic to evil and that's why I try to avoid it. But CindyVacaCat is my new niece and the new daughter of my hero and I will take care of her as if she were my own dog.  Cindy "Call Me Cindy / Just Call Me Cynthia" Allen. She and I met sophmore year of college and we immediately got along because we're both nuts (in a completely non-violent manner). The two Cindys were inseparable for two years.  When Cindy loved me, everything was beautiful. Every hour was spent together...  Cindy #1 (Uno) and I discovered everything that Rochester had to offer. And because we were done by 8pm, we spent the rest of that day singing the theme song to Golden Girls, badly. We had many deep conversations about nature vs. nurture, as Uno is example #1 about defying environmental influences. She emerged a caring, open-minded, non-judgemental saint.  Cindy was my partner in crime and partner in life. My days were always filled with fun and love because she was there. She was selfless and allowed me to make my mistakes knowing that I would need her when I came back from ungodliness. And she was. Years Two and Three of college were fun because of you. I lived Years Two and Three because of you.   urlLink    Uno Y Dos urlLink
