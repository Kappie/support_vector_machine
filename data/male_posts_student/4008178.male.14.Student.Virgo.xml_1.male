Concert crap:          Chivo - Chivo - Chivo - Chivo -  Fecha: Domingo 18 de Julio. Hora: 5:00 p.m.Lugar: Gospel Music, Outlet Mall, San Pedro.Valor: ¢1.000.Grupos: Osho, No Resolution?, Up Shock, Neginot, Días de Agonía.            Ok, so this was my first time at going to Gospel. I shouldve known this before, but people there told me the concerts at Gospel generally start at about 6:30. i got there at 4:50. The concert started at 7 pm. *gonk* well, that was a lowdown on the café, since most people got there early. Not at 7.        I only got to see Neginot, Up Shock, Dias de Agonia and No resolution?.        The concert started out with neginot playing. I basically went to the gig to check out neginot, since i know the bassist dude and wanted to listen to them. So basically you could say the play death metal? You know, a hardcore type of scream, and some changing riffs... everyone in the band can play really good. The singer was constantly jumping up and down the bandstand, blah. Sorta got everyone in the mood, and the sound guy was using them to try out noise. everyone was just getting seated when they played.        next was... no resolution. I cant really remember these guys, i liked them but not that much. their music could get better anytime. sorta crappy riffs and crap that made me hungry. yeah, hungry. anyways, ill give this band 6/10, just because i cant really remember them.        Then came dias de agonía. i had never heard this band. First of all, every guy in the band was straight edge, from what i could see. These guys play hardcore. Just hardcore. Didnt really get the lyrics because of all the screaming. The singer dude looks gay. i mean, maybe he was trying to look tough, but he really looks gay. like hes coming at you to rape you. the drummer got his drum loose and they had to stop playing. everyone clapped except me, who... was maybe too tired. the singer really needs to know how to sing. i mean, yeah, screaming sounds cool but if all you hear is GIAR GIARR YEARHG! for like 20 minutes it gets boring. overall good band. but not worth buying their cd.        then came upshock. ok these guys i had already heard, but i dont like them that much anymore. its general punk that you would get by listening to pennywise. the singer was constantly wooing out the lyrics and then screaming a bit. Really retarded. and he's like 40, i mean, what the fuck. ok this band sucks ass, dont even pay for one of their concerts. get a guitar and make quick noises and there you have upshock.        so basically lets talk about the place. Its your general internet cafe, a 20 by 20 room with red dim lights. The sound guy sucks. He plays the music so loud i got bored and left. it starts hurting after a while. specially when they play hardcore. The room is so packet up with chairs theres no room for skanking/moshing. besides, all the people gather around the center like if they cant get to see the band from 10 meters away.        There was this slipknot fan dude who kept making coreography to the music, looked kinda like a dj with no turntable. the only difference between the dj and this dude would be that uh.. yeah.  BEWARE  you might find this guy at a concert. he wears bike glasses so that he can aerodinamically soar to the bar, wears a slipknot hoodie and finger cut gloves. I dont know why everyone knows him, but to say the truth i really couldnt care less.    The pit consisted of 4 people. The slipknot dude and three other kids. well there was a big guy but whatever. The reason of why you cant make a pit in a 1x1 four people space is that you cant move around. these guys were waiting for the other guy to finish so that they could punch the air like a moron. Then there was the human windmill. who moves his arms so fast you can actually see them.        basically the concert sucked. i did enjoy listening to neginot though. I told the bar dude to get some ear plugs or he'd go deaf.        There was also this little 5 year old girl in there. apparently i was the only one who cared, because all those other motherfuckers just laughed at her. i mean, she was with her mom, who worked at the café, but what would happen if you see a hardcore show everyday since you were 5? i mean come on, how can a little girl be in a place like this? yeah anyways. i saw like 6 ppl from school. blah.        like, everyone at the concert was wearing like 50,000 colones in clothes. what the hell, arent they supposed to be the working class? anyways ill rant about this tomorrow or some other day when i have the time. and i also have to talk about the art exhibition i went to today. it was.... lame. yeah. but now its 11 pm and i needa sleep some. bye bye
