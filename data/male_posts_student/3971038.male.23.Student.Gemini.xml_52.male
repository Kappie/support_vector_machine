I wonder why.. i have tried all means but to no avail.. so i had to resort to using the MSN Explorer.. that worked.. very fine indeed.. but then again.. one find day.. which was like 4 days ago... that also went bonkers.. i can't log in .. even after numerous tries.. and several days.. i asked my friends.. all said they could log in.. but me, NO. haiz.. and guess what i am using now to add an entry at my blog? Its Kazaa... haha.. u know Kazaa got the web icon by the most left hand side? that could be use to surf the net.. and right now i am using that.. gosh..  i think i havta reboot my PC liao... DAMN IT!!! ARRRGGGHH!!!
