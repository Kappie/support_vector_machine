It lasted all morning. I could  not go out and play soccer with my buddies. Instead I stayed at home all day and looked at the four walls around me. Just joking. I rested and I felt slightly better at night.   At night I downloaded I dont Wan u back music video by Eamon. The video was quite nice. I have been hearing the song but I have not seen the video. Somehow Mtv does not show it. maybe they do when i am not watching tv. Talking about TV, i am going to watch France vs Ukraine match now on CH5. My favourite national team.  Ciaoz.
