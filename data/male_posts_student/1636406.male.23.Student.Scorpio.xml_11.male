It was hard sitting in the heat figuring out how to pronounce compounds I've never seen, plus a few kanji I never knew... like bugs.  so now I'm about ready to hit the reset button with my trusty ice pick- my brain is too full, and I think I'm risking seizures looking at all these black little lines.  So tip of the day: Don't learn Kanji in the sun!
