What i can see now is that Reyes is getting better and hopefully gonna be as good as Henry one day. Bergkamp, Reyes, Ljungberg and Pires scored for Arsenal but we musn't forget about Henry ..... he assisted 2 goals. Anyway Arsenal will have to face Boro next week and they have to win or draw to maintain unbeaten.
