Hello everyone, and welcome to...(cue flat trumpets and stuttered drum roll)...Dave's first Blog entry! As you may have guessed (that is, if you found your way here while looking for my old subprofile), this is going to be the new medium for my madness. And hopefully I will write a great deal more in here, maybe even inspiring myself to write other things again...something I haven't done in ages.       I'm honestly too tired to continue tonight, but when I get another chance, I will return here and finish filling out my profile, and all that jazz. Until then, farewell!
