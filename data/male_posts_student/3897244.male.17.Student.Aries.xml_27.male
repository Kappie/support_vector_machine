Those who I hurt their hearts  Took advantage of  And even lied to  Hug you one last time  For forgiveness  Yeah I would like to  If I die tonight  Would you feel the loss?  Tomorrow would you dial  My number by accident  Then suddenly... pause?  If I die tonight  I wonder who would get  To keep my caps and shoes  Jerseys, even my little  Stuffed crocodile Coco too  Get my cell phone  Message everyone from A to Z  Tell 'em this ain't Malique  He passed away last night  And pray he rest in peace  If I die tonight  Would you think of my room  When you see blue  Wanted to clean it up this morning  But then I never knew  If I die tonight  What would happen to Tim  How long would it take  Before she kissed another man?...  God damn...  At fast food joints  Would she still order  The same combo meal for two?  Things I wish I knew...    Chorus (2X)  If I die tonight  You know it'll be alright  Just smile for me  Reminisce the fond memories    Verse 3  A cute lil' thing  To many eyes  To me you were simply  A beautiful thing  I tell no lies  We went from  Mere invisible friends  To pals real tight  Rendezvous up on the net  To chitty chat all night  I used to pick you up  Until you got your own ride  A slammin' two door whip  A grey 36-72  Lookin' all slick  Remember when I asked why this  You said because it's real fast  So you can rush  To see your boy after class  The last time  We met was '01 September  You left feelin' upset over... something  I can't remember...  I never apologized  Till January 10th 2003  When I heard you passed away  When I was deep in my sleep  Your loss taught me  Not to take my friends for granted  Misunderstandings  Gotta slam it quick  Death you never plan it  You're sorely missed down here Wawyn  Rest in peace  This too shall pass  But our true friendship will never cease...  Love...    Chorus (till end)  If I die tonight  You know it'll be alright  Just smile for me  Reminisce the fond memories.."  thats a full song of too phat... a song that's dedicated to their close late pal wawyn.. who passed away in year 2003.. =\ meaningful song huh..  yeaH.. i went to the planet shaker's peformance.. their songs were cool ignoring the lyrics.. =P ima free thinker.. no offence to all christians.. =P probably they're classified in a genre called "god rock".. haHaha =P they aint no punK.. no spike hairs no punk shoes.. no tattoos either.. they aint no metal.. thier songs arent that heavy.. hmm.. so i created a new genre and fit them in..
