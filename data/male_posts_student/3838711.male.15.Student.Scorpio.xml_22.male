Yesterday night Wee Meng sms-ed me, and he was like saying how he felt sad about me like this... he wants me to 'wake up' and strive hard... all his pep talk kind of fell on deaf ears... as i went to slp yesterday night with lots of regrets of things i did in the past, and fatigue. Sorry Wee Meng.. I'll try my best to work myself up and get back my perspectives.. just as what Heron said, I need a break and time to come back strong... I know its hard but i'll just try...  Still somewhat feeling down.. (is there any day i wont ?) and it seems pple are involved in love one way or the other... Heron liked a girl but he couldnt tell, and the girl couldnt accept. He just tried all he could to protect her, any way he can, and i feel thats VERY noble... to not able have someone by your side but still caring for him/her always...  Went to Dhoby Ghaut to pass the DVD-RW back to the buyer, and on the way home i was like thinking.. the pros and cons of having a relationship... but i'll still rather have someone i can talk to than be alone and facing the 4 walls that surround me all day...  Sherman called me at 9 plus in the morning today, we talked a bit.. his favourite hamster died, and his dear Bernice and him talked all night till the morning.. he was like comforting her all night... wow.. the power of love, making him stay on the phone and not sleep.. I think i could do it too, but, whos gonna even give me the chance to ? Fate Fate Fate... blah.. be patient.. and all that stuff.. i dont really think i can wait any more...   All this mood change is causing me a lot of trouble in my daily life. Not able to finish homeworks on time, unable to run good timing in IDAS, and off form in wadever i try to accomplish. This sucks.  To top it off, what a addition to this entry, i was like trying to put the cover for the pillow in, and this time it wouldnt go smoothly. My mum came in, saw me throw the cloth on the floor, and she started to shout at me. Really, she didnt notice about this reaction of mine, yet she cared more was about the damn pillow cover. Nice. Doesnt anyone ever pay attention to me ? Not even my closest parents ?   .... Let me die in my sleep. Please. Life has totally lost its meaning, at least on me. Let me DIE.
