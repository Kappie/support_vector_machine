I cooked breakfast and watched TV like I usually do and I finally got up to wake him up.  He freaked, got up, washed his face and left.  He said I should have woken him up 30 minutes earlier.  I got to work and go to work on DARS and MVS stuff.  Real boring to everyone else.  But I asked Emily, Katie, Janina and Susan about what I should do for our dinner.  They all had a wide range of suggestions, from casserole to Dinosaur BBQ to cold cuts.  I decided on cold cuts.  So I made a grocery list and made plans for after work.  I really don't know how the day went so fast, but it did.  Emily and I went to the gym at noon.  Not anything exciting, but while I was changing, a guy sat right next to me and started talking to me.  He's like "isn't it always the way that when two guys are in a locker room, they'll always be right next to each other?"  Umm.. buddy, you came after me.  But going to the gym 10 minutes of noon sure does give you breathing room when you're showering.  No big rush to make it back by 1.  Cindy called and I had a long conversation with her about some people she's talked to in the past couple of days.  Then my sister called and talked to me about harassing voice mails.  Then I talked to my mother.  Then I talked to like 10 companies about address changes and such.  Yeah, I got a lot of work done.  It's a slow week, so kill me! :)  I also got my car insurance reduced since I won't be using my car to drive to work anymore.  I'm canceling my parking Monday. They're crediting me $15 for parking and GEICO is crediting me $50 for walking to work from now on.  Cindy and I headed to Wegmans and I bought a ton of food for the picnic.  Ranging from cold cuts to vegetables to chips and dip.  I also bought sweet corn.  We went to the apartment around 6:05 and our guests were going to start arriving at 7.  We hurriedly cooked, making macaroni salad, spreading out the cold cuts, cutting the bread, preparing the beans and divvying up the ice.  It was quite a spread.  Laura, Luke and Jake all arrived around the same time.  Kristen also came home (after being away for a long long time).  We all laughed, talked, joked and whatever for several hours.  Cindy showed off her burn mark, Luke talked on his cell phone for two hours, Laura was funny as always and I just quietly worked on my computer.  We had a great time.   urlLink   Jake  Cindy   urlLink   Laura  Luke  Jake was in the bathroom for most of the time.  Well, he just corrected me, he was only in the bathroom for 25 minutes.  However, when he got out and we were packing things up, he tried to stick a corn cob down everyone's pants.  Laura said, "I don't think I've ever had corn down there!"  They all left around 10, after Fantasia won the American Idol competition.  By the way, the other night when I said the Hawaiian girl, I meant the girl that auditioned in Hawaii.  Sorry to those I confused.  We're just sitting in the living room discussing everything and anything.  I think Kristen is happy my friends are gone.  We were talking about how Jake always wants his way when he wants it but doesn't respond when others ask things of him.  For example, I asked him if he wanted to play video games.  He said no.  However, he's asked me to play video games the last 3 days.  I asked him if he'd skip an autocross for Rachael and he replied: I wouldn't skip the autocross even if Rachael was in the hospital.  Wow, you picked a winner Rach!  (By the way, thanks for checking out my blog.)  We'll see what tomorrow brings.  I need to start packing.
