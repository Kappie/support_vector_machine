Pretty bored though, cuz my buds  Nick  and  Elyse  and a few  other people  are online, but they are either not there, or I'm tryin' to refrain from talkin' to them.  God, I need someone to talk to, or I'll seriously go crazy.  Have any of you ever had this thing...this thing that you really, really liked, actually...this person, that you really liked, and you wanna talk to them so bad, but you can't?  Have you ever wondered if that person that you like happens to like you back?  And all these thoughts are buzzin' around in your head, and you don't know what to think anymore?  Sounds like some crazy openin' for an infomercial...anyway, yeah.  I am in that current position, and its drivin' me crazy.  OK, you guys gotta stay by me on this one...I don't think I can get through it without everyone by my side.  Fuck...life couldn't suck anymore.  Man, this isn't a very good blog...the urge to blog....slowly...decreasin'...the urge to kill...slowly...steadily...never existing.  Haha, OK...with your help, I'm goin' long and goin' strong!  Yeeeeaaah!  More to come...!
