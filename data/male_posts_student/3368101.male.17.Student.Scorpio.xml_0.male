Plus, I had to do some research there, on children playground furniture, for my upcoming DT exam.   Big Brother is much better thi year. Emma, the stupid thick cow is doing my head in though! Get her out of the house already.  Harry Potter 3: The Prisoner of Azkaban comes out tomorrow :D, not sure if i'll go to watch it tomorrow though, might wait till my exams are over - nah, I'll try and go tomorrow! :D  Over and out.
