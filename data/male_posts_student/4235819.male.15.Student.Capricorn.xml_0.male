Feel free to post if you feel I've left anything out, especially those of you with the XBox or GameCube version, since I have the PlayStation2 version.  Anyway, the first person I'm going to do is Ivy.  Here goes.  1=down away    2=down    3=down toward    4=away    6=toward    7=up away    8=up    9=up toward    +=hit these two buttons at the same time    A=horizontal attack    B=vertical attack    K=kick    G=guard    : =ends in following stance    no space=enter commands right after one another    lower case then uppercase=slide first button to second button    H=recommended for versus humans only    x=hold last command          Horizontal Advance - A+B (Spiral Serenade), A (Serpent Slash: Spiral Tribute), A (Raging Flames: Serpent's Embrace), AA (Violent Spirits)         Quick Chaos - 214 or B+K (Pleasure Change: Whip State), A+B (Venom Strike: Serpent's Embrace), 6B+K (Stinging Souls, Long Range, if closest to enemy.  Otherwise, use 4B+K for Close Range)         Farce (H) - 1 or 2 or 3+B+KGB+K (Fear's Void, Any Range (Cancel): Crouch to Asylum)         Aerial Entrapment - 8A+BA (God Whisper: Enemy in air), B6B (Squire's Cage)         Aerial Punishment - 8A+BA (God Whisper: Enemy in air), 214Bx (Venom Lash: Serpent's Embrace), A+B (Released Souls)         Total Entrapment - 6B+Kx (Embrace of Lust), G+B (Dominion Throw, Heartless Guide, Sunset Cradle, or Sweet Dominance), 3B+Kx (Gnome Huntress)  This is a personal favorite.  The only thing I have left is a tip for fighting Ivy.  Beware her dirty tricks: she is one of the few characters who can keep you on the ground almost as long as she wants.  At every chance, get within her sword's range and roll sideways along the ground.  Raphael is a personal favorite for fighting her, because of his dodges.  Yoshimitsu is your worst choice, as he does not move sideways well except at a cost to his health.  Necrid, Nightmare, Astaroth, and Kilik are probably the actual best for fighting her, since they come the closest to matching her long range.  Okay, that's all I have for now.  Stay tuned as I master other characters for more tips!
