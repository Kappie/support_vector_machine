I went over to my friend Karl's house after school today along with another friend (Joe). Joe was like totally rocking out all day. 'Twas pretty entertaining. ;) And then, of course, there was some time spent making fun of me, but that is to be expected. :P  Most people think that summer break means staying up late and sleeping until noon the next day. AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I wish. Here's my daily summer schedule:  5:30am - Wake up, get ready for swim practice 6-8:30am - Swim practice 9-10:00am - Lifeguard inservice 12-6:30pm - WORK as lifeguard  Only positive thing is that i get $7 an hour. Not too bad. :)  k catch ya on the flip-side. More ramblings later maybe.
