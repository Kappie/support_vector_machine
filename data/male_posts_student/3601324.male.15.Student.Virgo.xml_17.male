So yesterday, the hair salon put up the message "WE DIDN'T PUT UP THE BARRIER." on their sign. Apparently, people using he hair salon had been using the church's parking lot. The church didn't like that and put up the barrier. Why? I haven't clue. They only need it on one day of the freaking week. Seemed a tad selfish. Especially being the pure little Christian place of prayer that it is. So today, the salon changed their sign again to say "LOVE THY NEIGHBOR." XD All I could think was, "Pwned." Silly hypocritical Christians.  Anyhow, went to the comic store today. They didn't have any of the books I was looking for though, so that kinda sucked. So instead I bought a CD. Amnesiac by Radiohead. I've been meaning to buy it for a long time. Overall, it's pretty enjoyable. Definately not their best though.  Whee! Tomorrow's the last day of school!
