That's quite understandable, but we fortunately don't need that....  We're in it for the eyeballs. (Yumm, eyeballs.) So if you like the blog, just let your friends know about it -- perhaps take a blog post you really like, pass it along (together with its URL) to people who you think would enjoy it, and tell them that there's a lot more where that came from. Or not: We're happy with just your eyeballs, too. And Volokh's hits jumped from about 12,000 Tuesday to about 16,000 Wednesday.  (Yes, that's a lot of readers.)  Maybe there were other reasons (someone popular linked?).  But interesting.    I'm not very subtle, am I?  :)
