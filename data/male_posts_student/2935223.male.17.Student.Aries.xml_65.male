I've been trying this new thing called "being happy", because everyone has been telling me to "be happy".  It kinda failed fast.  Especially after being called "shattered".  I know that I have been changed.  IT has changed me.  Not just IT, many things after and before IT have changed me.  Whethere for the better or worse I can't say.  I see both sides of myself.  I see the two faces.  I see the lies and deceit.  I see the love and joy.  I see the murderous hate and jealousy.  I see the calm and collected.  I would like to say I know everything about myself...but I can't.  I just don't know myself anymore.  I know that almost every day for the last two summers I was hangin' out with Kyle and Ervin, and already this summer I've spent more days at home then both summers combined.  I can't help it.  I'm a slave of my emotions.  Anyone who knew me before and after all of this can easily tell that I'm a different person.  I can even tell.  Unfortunately I can't remember who I was...  I hurt people. I get hurt. I can't trust anyone fully. I can't trust myself fully. I try to help people with their problems, I take small steps. I try to help myself with my own problems, I can't even crawl. I cause more problems... I solve more problems... I TRY TO BE CLEVER IN MY BLOG BUT FAIL LIKE THE INSIGNIFICUNT CUNT-FUCK BASTARD I AM!!! I HATE MYSELF SO MUCH!! I LOVE OTHERS SO MUCH!! I HURT OTHERS TOO MUCH!! I HURT MYSELF TOO MUCH!!  I TYPE IN CAPS TOO MUCH!!  sorry, I was getting really depressing...so i decided to make myself laugh. That's the only way I seem to be able to help people.  By making them laugh.  I wish I was useful for more than that...like actually being a half decent person. As I speak, I'm having a conversation with sumone who everytime I see them around "other people" I want RIP MYSELF IN HALF!!! There is another person whom I have hurt badly, I really didn't want to, I really wish that the one time I had made a split-second decision, I hadn't.  Yet, I don't want it to start again...because I fear that I will hurt them more.  One second I can swear to myself that I will be the loving, caring person that sumone needs and deserves..but I can't do that.    Do you have the time  to listen to me wine about nothing and everything all at once? I am one of those mellow dramatic fools neurotic to the bone NO DOUBT ABOUT IT! Sometimes I give myself the creeps. Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me. It all keep adding up, I think I'm cracking up. Am I just paranoid, or am I just stoned?  good f***in' song.   If you're sumone I know and I've hurt you recently...I'm sorry.   I'm just not me anymore.  Spense
