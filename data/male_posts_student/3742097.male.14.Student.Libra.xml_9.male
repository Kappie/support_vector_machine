I spent 20 some minutes at the picnic with my family from my mom's side. If you knew them you would know why I left after that amount of time.   Julianna's gone. Oh well, but I wont talk about her in here. But, lol, after she told me I took the picture of us and put it face down. Lol, it's still down. I'll right it sometime/day/year.  Then I played tennis with my dad, and I did better than usual. And on this one point I ran full speed into a metal fence. And it hurt more than it should have because I forgot where I was on the court.  Right after tennis I got the best news I have heard all summer, I am not eating with my mom's family, I am going to the Olive Garden. That brightened me right up, my dad was pissed that I got to go and not him hehe. I took a shower and I had a noticeable hop in my step. I took the quickest shower I have ever taken, lol. Can you tell I really wanted to go? I was soooo happy that I dressed up for it. I wore black dress pants and a uhhh smooth feeling dress shirt. It's something. And I wore my black ADIDAS's, the ones I never wear, I never tied them :-D. But the food sucked, all of the food sucked. The best part of going there was the fact that I was the best dressed in the place :-D! Actually, the Coke was better than the Pork Tenderloin. They make it better in Manhattan.  Someday I will live in Manhattan and I will be a regular at the Olive Garden. I will always sit in the booth viewing Time Square and the Stock report. And then, of course, there is a window there. Manhattan is my favorite place to be, with Banana Republic and the Gap all with jacked up prices who wouldn't want to be there?  So let me slip away Against the current Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right  I swear I knew it all along
