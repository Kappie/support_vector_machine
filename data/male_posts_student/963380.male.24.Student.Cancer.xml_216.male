That led to all sorts of interesting things Sunday night - some things that I really shouldn't go into here, cause GOD DAMN the situation is screwed up. I end up having most of my day annihilated and the following day bites it as well because they need me to close. We show better results then we ever have on a Monday but it still wasn't enough to actually be classified as "good". Dan called it "the curse of the Glennis", I said we probably shouldn't speak ill of the dead.  Open box and clearance are goind well - we found out that one of the London stores was cheating - faking their results by manipulating the system - made me feel better about our current standing. Dennis called Tom a blowhard during our last conversation - I can see that point of view after I was "given the gears" today. I simply nodded and listened as he distributed information with what can only be described as a "wry smile" on his face. 90% of what he said was good, but I'm not going to put a shit eating grin on my face and lick his asshole for the other 10%. It needs fixing? C'est bon, let us fix.  I've got my SMD interview on Thursday - that's exciting. I've also got the details for a $400,000 sale in the works too - hope that goes through.  Spider-Man 2 the game is religious. *thwip* waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah *thwip* - lather, rinse, repeat for flavour.  City of Heroes is lovely. I'm level 26 now - I've got a new power that assaults small groups of villains - goes off like a little bomb with great range. I like.  I bought Batman the Animated Series Season One - god I loved that show. I've missed it. Kinda freaked me out to see I look a little like Bruce Timm - I guess I always expected him to be a pastel pink with a square jaw and two lines for eyes.  We've got paintball and soccer being organized through work. I've also been drafted into the Joint Health and Safety Comittee - as if I didn't have enough to do.  The fun never stops.  Never. Fucking. Stops.
