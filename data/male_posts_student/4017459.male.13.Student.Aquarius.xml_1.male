Today i was suppose to go fishing with my friends at our secret place( i think), but because of we dont have any bait, we canceled the plan(hmm.. so sad). WAAAAA!!!!! so boring, so i chat with Khadijah and Farhan. And Khadijah, u dont mind if i put "Life As A Student and Teenager" to? Ok thats all i have to say today. Bye........
