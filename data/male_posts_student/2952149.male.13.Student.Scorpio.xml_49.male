Mr. Carter was like "Tim, get up here!" He had to spend the rest of lunch up in lunch detention. It was so funny lmao. In 5th period something good happened but im not saying anything because well....just nevermind lol. Oh yeah I almost forgot, that Shvartzer is coming to school tomorrow. Shvartzer is Yiddish for nigger and you say it like shvatsa. Wow you just learned a new word and black people don't even know what your talking about when you say it lol. But anyway, yeah she is coming again to talk to us about sex and stuff just like last week.
