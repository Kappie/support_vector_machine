I think I may have to lock myself into my chair to stop temptation running it's course...  I was annoyingly sickening earlier, but Fi didn't mind, so that was OK. I wasn't being sickening about Fi, obviously.  Anyway, tired. Love you all.  Quote of the day: "In my life, She has burst like the music of angels, The light of the sun. And my life Seems to stop as if something is over, And something has scarcely begun."  From   In My Life   from   Les Mis   Love, Jon Roskilly
