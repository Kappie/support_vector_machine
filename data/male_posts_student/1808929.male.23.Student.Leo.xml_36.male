Pathology is pretty grueling work; I can't remember having ever studied harder than I studied this last week, but for now I'm just going to try to forget about all that and hang out with friends and family.   Last night there were about 8 of us over at Omar's place 'till about 2am. It was awesome to finally hang loose a little bit. Finally there was someone there who would drink with me! I don't know what it is about the friends I know, but none of them ever seem to drink. I think I'm caught in the middle sometimes: too introverted and reserved to have fun among the drinking crowd, yet too ... **I don't know the word** to be able to have fun with those who don't drink. Basically, I gotta have something to loosen the tension, be it EtOH, Zoloft, whatever. Anyway, last night was fun.   A couple days ago I heard from my good friend Fernando. He's one of my best friends from TAMS and is finishing up his business degree at UNT. I hadn't seen or heard from him since new years day. The last time I saw him he gave me a DVD of all the videos he took of our group of friends while we were at TAMS. It was a very cool gift. However, we got into this unfortunate discussion about how I've changed. Fern thinks that since having come back from Texas I'm much more of a hard-ass. I got really upset about that. I'm not upset about what he said 'cause it's mostly true. I'm not like I was at TAMS; People and situations change. Isn't that a normal part of the college experience? What I'm upset about is that he doesn't appreciate how and why I am the way I am. What I'm upset about is that Fern likes to live his life like a series of Friends episodes. The videos he took of all his friends in HS are picture perfect, but they're all taken out of context and detached from real life (which is always less sit-com and more prosaic). I don't know...this whole topic is a little depressing. Moving on now...  I don't know why people think that the Pirates of the Caribbean movie is so cool. I saw it today and it was pretty boring I thought.    Songs of the day   I'm Always In Love , Wilco, 1999.   Desperately Wanting , Better Than Ezra, 1996.   Let Down , Radiohead, 1997.
