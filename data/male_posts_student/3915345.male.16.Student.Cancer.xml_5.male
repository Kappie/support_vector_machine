For a competitive team with some under-rated players, here's a list of players that I feel qualify to be on a top team in a league and reasons why.   Batting:   1.  urlLink R. Belliard - Holding a great average, he isn't doing as well as he has been starting off, but he's hitting more HR's, and scoring more runs. He still manages to get on base quite a bit, and 2nd base doesn't have too many promising players.   2.  urlLink B. Wilkerson - This player has been one of the only hot hitting expos, doing it with doubles and HR's lately. Seems to always manage to get an RBI or run during a game. Consistency is key with him.   3.  urlLink E. Byrnes - Although outfield is probably the easiest position to find good players, Byrnes is pretty good himself. He leads the team with SB's, and has been hot as of late June. Pretty good player to hold on to the bench at least.   4.  urlLink T. Wigginton - I wouldn't have said him a month ago, but lately he's been the hot hitter for the Mets. HR's, doubles, and RBI's seem to be racking up for him, and he just seems to be continually improving to try and stay on the Mets team and not get traded. There is purpose behind this 3rd/2nd baseman.   5.  urlLink R. Clayton - Hiding in that Colorado hitting team is a shortstop with great ability to hit, not really Hr's, but more singles. Probably a better back-up SS, he can be a good secret among hitters to get the average up. Pretty good with runs as well as a result, maybe even an RBI here and there.   Pitching:   1.  urlLink V. Zambrano - This pitcher is on what seemed to be the worst team, but Zambrano seemed to move the team in the right direction, leading the team with wins and pitching the most innings, meaning he's a healthy, long-enduring pitcher. Strike-outs have become a main aspect of this pitcher, being a top 5 strike-out pitcher for the AL for 3 months already.   2.  urlLink D. Graves - This one seems obvious by now, but it still holds true; he is helping the reds stay above .500 for now. At 32 saves, he already tied his major-league best, and he still has half a season to go. That division seems to be just getting harder, but they are good contenders themselves. Graves is a guy promising enough to help them stay that way when they have a lead.   3.  urlLink J. Marquis - Just what the Cardinals needed, a great pitcher to emerge and help take them to the top of the NL. At 9-4 at the All-Star break, and quite a few K's, this pitcher will continue to get run support from his team which has many all-stars. Plus he has a good closer behind him.   4.  urlLink V. Santos - Behind Sheets for the Brewers, Santos has been a really big help to the team. They remain over .500 during the All-star break and at 8-3, Santos has chipped in to that occurrence. He hasn't pitched much, but that only leaves room for improvement because his stats are not too bad with the amount of innings he's pitched and the result of having an 8-3 record.   5.  urlLink N. Robertson - This Tiger's pitcher has been hot for the team, with the most wins for Detroit and the lowest ERA for the team at a pretty bad 4.11, he obviously gets much run support from the hot-hitting Tigers. Not only is his winning column impressing, but his strike-outs have been up there near the top of the AL at 94.
