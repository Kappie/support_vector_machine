Well, my personal definition and opinion is that multiculturalism is racism in a politically-correct guise. It holds that an individualâ€™s identity and personal worth are determined by ethnic/racial membership and that all cultures are of equal worth, regardless of their moral views or how they treat people. Multiculturalism holds that ethnic identity should be a central factor in educational and social policy decisions. Multiculturalism would turn this country into a collection of separatist groups competing with each other for power. So what do you think?    Jon G.
