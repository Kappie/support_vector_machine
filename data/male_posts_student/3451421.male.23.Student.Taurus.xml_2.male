Centralization vs. Fragmentation= I feel that new technology causes centralization. People of different backgrounds are coming together to work and improve things. A holistic perspective vs. Specialized knowledge=  New technology  creates a holistic perspective by making new knowledge available to all. People then receive a more holistic perspective on things. Too much information vs. Too little information= Technology makes so much informtion available that there is too much information to sift through to try to find what you want. Leadership vs. Fellowship= technology causes fellowship among people because people feel a sense of community in new technologies with the others that use it Worker isoliation/alientation vs. Community connections= Technology is isolating the worker of today. With all the new mobile technology, people donâ€™t have a sense of an office community as in the past. Sharing vs. Withholding access to information= Information "filters" vs. Disintermediation (Removing the middleman. The term is a popular buzzword used to describe many Internet -based businesses that use the World Wide Web to sell products directly to customers rather than going through traditional retail channels. By eliminating the middlemen, companies can sell their products cheaper and faster. Source: http://www.webopedia.com) = removing the middle man can be good for the consumer in terms of cost, but what about all the jobs these middlemen have. Are they no longer employed because of the act of disintermediation. Public intervention vs. Private decisionmaking= technology has created an atmostphere of public intervention. The public can now band together using technology to get stuff done. Which cities are America's Most Wired Cities?

What do you think the affect the future city will have on the individual?   The author says that the individual will have many constraints.  He also says that people will need to be more like a program in a computer, doing there specific part. They drive home the point that freedoms will be limited. I feel like after the inception of this future city, the concept of individual will be lost. They seem to overlook the basic human desire of free will. If they tried this I feel that they would have problems.
