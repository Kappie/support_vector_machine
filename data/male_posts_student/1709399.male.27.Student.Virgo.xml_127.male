The answer I would have loved to give them is Everything interests me .                                    I remember reading a Book called Ã„ndromeda Strain" by Micheal Crichton a few years back. The protagonist in this novel is a Nobel Prize winning Scientist named Jeremy Stone. I simply liked the way Jeremy Stone was introduced by Crichton . Crichton says "Jeremy knows everything and is fascinated by the rest ". I thought that one line said it all.
