Met up with yun today, lots of thanks to her for the stuff she brought over.Really excited to see her again. She came all the way to my house after her driving lessons to send the stuff to me, mighty thanks to her. Went to the city for dinner and had a great tine chatting. Hmm, ha wanted to send her back home but she really insisted that I do not have to send her up to her doorsteps. I thought i could if i insisted, well i guess she and I are real stubborn. So in the, i had to give in. Got to say sorry to her if i delayed her time. Hey, by the way, next Tuesday will be my cooking day, i have invited her over to our place for dinner, not confirmed yet. The not so good thing is that my days are the longest on thursday, while she is free on Thursday, haah. Bo bian..   Anyway, had my first lab lessons on friday. I almost forgot all the java coding. Looks like I got real catching up stuff to do. Did some econs today. So how do i feel now? ok la. nothing much ya. Hope all the guys back in singapore are doing fine. Wish everything is a OK back home too. Alrighty,got to go.  Ja mata ne
