My plans for regular blogging as well as bev mod are equally buried. Much has happened and I'm far too lazy to tell it all, but some must be told.   Firstly, I most definitely am going to the Icthus Concert! YES! I have found and hooked up with Lake Harbor United Methodist Church's youth group to travel screaming down deep into the bowels (figuratively) of Kentucky for what could easily be the greatest musical experience of my petty existence. It will cost $100 straight, but that's OK as it involves renting vans, gas, and maybe food. My mom and I will split the costs 50/50 even though I will be the only one in my family going. There was only one seat left!  Nextly, I went to hang with Emily and her friends tonight. Stop thinking that! Right now! Stop it! Ok, anyways, it was a great insight into the workings of the female world. I've seen both sides of the contiuum now: Insanity and semi-depressed artisticness. Much sugar was consumed; many questions from my many Books of Questions were asked and laughed at. It was good.  I am reading "The Problem of Pain" by C.S. Lewis. It is an easier read then when I tried 7-8 years ago, but now it is a hard read because I understand what he says. The doctrine that hits hardest, which though I've always believed but have never really inacted, is the belief of complete self-surrender to God. I banged around in my head in slavering hatred of this doctrine. I love the thought of controlly myself and my surrounding but it cannot be if God exists and Christianity is true. I've seen, heard, and thought too many things to even try to rid myself of Christianity. It will stay there until eternity, and I mus submit to this cruel yet obvious fact. To act only for God...to speak only in honor of him...to live only for his Glory...it all sounds so...well...painful. Is there no room in the inn for my little gaming life? What about secular music or comedic books or anything else that does not directly honor God? Must they all die? I fear I do not know. This requires more thought...
