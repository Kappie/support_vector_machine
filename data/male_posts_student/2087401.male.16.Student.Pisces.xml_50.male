It had all these serial killers and what they did listed and all sorts of creepy sadistic things. Its also had some "symptoms" for phsycopathic/serial killery...ness. There was bedwetting until adolesence as one and animal torture and obsession with fire too.. I like fire (-^^-) lol  Eeww, Marten, that game is gross. Even if it isn't really that graphic its just... =p. And its 6:15 when you come in! 6:15!  Sophia: thnx =D and you're welcome  I can't think of a title scheme so just give me one and I'll stick to it.  SQUEE!
