The title of this song/poem is Nothing At All      I didn't know it  i never cared  i didnt know what to say just thought id go my way   always thought you felt the same  deep down knowing im the one to blame you were happy and i took it away so can i ask you this.....   What would you do if i got up and left would you be pissedd and upset would you write, would you call or say nothing at all?   what i did was wrong, it was cruel i never thought i'd use you like a tool im not the one to play just didnt know guess it was one of those ddays so again ill say   What would you do if i got up and left would you be pissedd and upset would you write, would you call or say nothing at all?   its over and its done your heart has mend and ive been undone im back to where i started hoping this never happenned it wasnt because i was bad it was cause i made you sad   Worst of all..... You said nothing at all
