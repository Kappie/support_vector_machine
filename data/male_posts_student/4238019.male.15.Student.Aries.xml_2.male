First thing in the morning went to school for oral examination for Final Year Examinations. Felt relaxed when go to school, but facing Ms Png was a problem. I managed to say the Reading Aloud passage, but the picture was quite difficult. What a long wait for my turn man! No.10 candidate leh.. Wat the ****. Oops.. hehehe. Went to East Coast Park this afternoon with Krissy to book the bbq pit for my birthday leh..Yeah!.. The details are: Area C, BBQ pit no.8, 4th September 2004. I am inviting B-attitudes and Punked for the BBQ. Any of my schoolmates, or classmates who want to come, you're invited too. Just leave a msg on my hp: 91739619, or just come up to me to tell me abt it... Thanks! :P. After booking the bbq pit, went cycling with Krissy. Cycled to the jetty between area B & C, and went to the pond to see turtles. =X. After that, I went home. On the bus, I saw Kellin. She was going to Hougang Swimming Complex... Long time never see her already... She was with her brother... Ok.. Now I am hoping that Manchester United would get a win tonite to catch out wif Arsenal and Chelsea. Go Man Utd! Cristiano Ronaldo is back at Old Trafford already, after the stupid Athen Olympics 2004 prevented him to play against Chelsea last week. Gabriel Heinze is still wif Argentina in Athens too. My prefered formation for Manchester United:- Howard,G.Neville,Keane,Silvestre,O'Shea,Ronaldo,Miller,Djemba-Djemba,Giggs,Smith,Scholes. My prediction is 2-0 to Manchester United. Go For it! Do me proud of you! Yeah!~.
