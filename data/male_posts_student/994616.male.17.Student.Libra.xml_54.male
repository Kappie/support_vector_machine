I liked my creative writing, it was about Little Red Riding Hood and Jack (from the beanstalk fame) it started off with each of their stories, and the lumber jack saves them both. but in the second half of the story its bout all of the repercussions of their actions. Little red Riding Hood had psychological problems from seeing a wolf murdered right in front of her, and jack after killing the giant, then had to get a mortgage, tried insurance fraud, and was caught. He was tried for murder, theft, insurance fraud and well thats all :)  I'm listening to  Sleep Together  from the album "Version 2.0" by Garbage for more info on them click  urlLink here . I'd give this song about 4 stars out of 5
