I didn't wanna throw up onto my plate, so I quickly put it back on the tray and got some water instead, to have a 'homo-free' lunch. I simply can'T give a damn about homosexuality, so I simply don't give about people who choose to be f*cked up the ass, it's just that when it reaches the table where I have lunch..thats disgusting, sorry. This was what I saw:   urlLink    (click on image to enlarge!)  I mean...look at that, wtf is that? A girl or a guy? I don't want gay men on my coke, all right? I don't care about your new marketing strategy, and no, I am not gonna gel my hair and wear tight jeans and shirts!  YOU WILL NOT TURN ME GAY!   Jeez, I swear, some day, these faggots will turn being heterosexual illegal! To show how much I am against advertising products with gay men, I designed a new logo for coca-cola light, which is a bit more clear, and doesn't have any 'unnoticable details', so here it is:   urlLink     Hehe, I love making fun of large companies. :-)   Lesson learned:  Do not attempt, turning us, normal people into faggots!
