Only good news is that I uplaoded the rpg files before the crash so thats safe... everything else though... is gone...   On the bright side I'm getting tons of free stuff from Microsoft! Such as Windows XP Pro, a t-shirt, and lots of other stuff... I'll let you guys know everything when I get it.   Also, I was bored so I made a few functions that can used to search a MySQL database... go check it out:  urlLink func_search.phps
