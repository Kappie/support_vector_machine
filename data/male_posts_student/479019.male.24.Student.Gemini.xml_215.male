So we all got dressed up and trekked up there for a photo shoot, then we trekked all the way back. Then I went all the way up LA with Naomi and her friends for Ethiopian food. Good stuff. Then I went to hang out with Flo and her friends until 4:45 AM. Fun stuff.   Plans for today? None. Probably do some reading and maybe some painting as well. I want to be productive.   ***
