I called the cops at 3pm yesterday because the floors were shaking, not just in the living room, the entire freaking apt.  It eventually stoped.  Then started again at 7:30 and went until 11.  Began at 1:15am, but less loud.  I could sleep.  So that's a bright spot.  I'm considering writing a letter to the landlord or something.  Cause they were listening to music today and suprise suprise the floors didn't shake.  They can control this.  Assholes.  Seriously.  I can't wait for Thanksgiving break.  The only big thing I have to do, besides the arduious task of writing 3 pages on why prostitution should be legal, is come up with a new story.  Overall, the last one was well received the major complaint was that it was thin on details and they wanted more of the characters.  Which is basically the best criticism to get because that means the readers are digging it and want more of the good stuff.   One written comment pointed out that it sounded a lot like Good Will Hunting-which as I look back on it, does resemble it a lot, and not just cause the main character is named Will.  A Fruedian slip of sorts.  To be honest, it crossed my mind that it could be constured that way.  So long as the class didn't get into a big discussion about it.  Someone also made the mistake of writing "you and maggie" (main female lead in the story) instead of Will and Maggie.  Author is not narrator you incipid fc's... Everyone also wanted more details of the relationship and I thought to myself, well that would be one astounding piece of fiction cause I have no idea how to write that.  When you wish upon a star, a cricket dies.
