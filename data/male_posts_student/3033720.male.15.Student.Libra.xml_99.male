I'm going to post roughly 70 pics tomorrow. Things I need to say now. Ashley, wee  need to talk, desperately.(Yes, I know a spelt we with two e's). Matthew, I'm gonna miss you. Long live WeenyFacedFunnyMoney. Boo, you are our personal treasure. Never exploit yourself. Email me at  urlLink HamHamInTheHouse@gmail.com  if you wish to recieve a copy of Alex's breakdancing or puppet show. Make the subject line, Alex. Also, i can provide some neato pics. People, it's not automatic, it's hondamatic. Should I take a class to lose my southern accent? 'Till the 'morrow, me is out.
