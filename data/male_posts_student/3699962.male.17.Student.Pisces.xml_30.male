Love lost, love found, and love lost again.  If ever I were bless with an opportunity to love and be loved. And if my mate was taken away from me, I'd be crushed. Like Kevin Costner's role in the movie, Garrett Blakes? Yeah. I'd die. Or part of me would.  Love's strange... to me at least.  Never actually had a chance before. Heh. Talk about a hillbilly huh. Everyone in the world's now like in love. "Oh I'm so in love with so and so," "Oh I think I'm in love! *shrills*" -_-*  Love'll never be mine.  Don't ask me why I added this. I sorta have this gut feeling, like I'll never meet my soulmate before I go home to be with God. I stand to be corrected. And 'Disclaimer' I never was planning to speak it into existence, if I was actually meant to even have a soulmate.  Love has to be cherished.  As Maisarah so affectionately puts it, "it's true 'la' in life, expect the unexpected". You people out there, who actually have or had love, cherish that. Some people aren't as lucky.  I'll stop preaching now. Sherm
