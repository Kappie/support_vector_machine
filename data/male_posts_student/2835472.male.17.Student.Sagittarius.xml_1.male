Fridays are always awesome! ALWAYS!  Got a few new games to keep me occupied in my free time:  Beyond Good  Evil -- in progress Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic -- in progress Need for Speed: Underground -- in progress Deus Ex 2: Invisible War -- beat in 3 days Prince of Persia 2 -- beat in 2 days  Contact me if you want any of the above and I can get you the goods!  And for those of you that have no interest whatsoever, just ask me to yell out something random and it's bound to be... HILARIOUS! AH! Well, you already knew that... I mean Keyzer can only say things that are... AWESOME! Or... HILARIOUS! AH!  iSearch was coolio.  I need to see my grade on it.  Soon.  Now!  Curse you Mr. Webster and your darned baby taking attention from us oh-so-good students and our work! BAH!  Oh, I have to shout kudos! This time to myself!  Kudos to Keyzer for passing out on migraine medication!  Luckily I'd rather be sleeping like a dead man than having that crummy migraine again... I just said crummy. Cool.  Rad!  Later my friends.
