I knew she was talented, and I'm not talking about her role on the Sit Com "Will and Grace".  She has some great comedic moments on the show (W), but I'm more impressed with her talent on the stage... the legitimate theatre.  I grow more impressed with her the more I see.  (minds out of the gutters, pervs)  I hadn't seen SNL for a while, for some reason or the other... and it was good to come home.  I still miss the good ole cast of the days of yore, but... every once in a while the combination of host, musical guest, and sketches just all seems to come together to put on a really great show.  It also helps that I shared it with good company.  :)
