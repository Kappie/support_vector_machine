Fears Grow As Drug Firms Quit Antibiotic Research        By Ben Hirschler and Ransdell Pierson     LONDON/NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - With "superbugs" stalking hospitals and old killers such as tuberculosis re-emerging, the world badly needs more powerful antibiotics.     Yet the pipeline of new treatments is drying up as drug firms -- citing poor financial returns -- focus instead on chronic conditions, such as high cholesterol, where medicines are taken for years rather than curing patients in one or two weeks.      .....  "The regulatory requirements have risen to a level that has meant companies can no longer see the investment would be justified," said Trevor Jones, director general of the Association of the British Pharmaceuticals Industry, representing some of Europe's biggest drug makers.     The fate of Aventis SA's   new antibiotic Ketek has highlighted the problem for many pharmaceutical executives. To satisfy regulators, the Franco-German company had to conduct a huge -- and costly -- 24,000-patient study.     "That scared a lot of drug companies because it still has not been approved in the United States," said Tally. "The other thing that is scaring off big pharma is that if you do have a drug against resistant strains of bacteria, hospitals restrict use of it. They hold it in reserve, which cuts down on sales."
