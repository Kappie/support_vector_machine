I broke up with a girl I love, I've come to the conclusion that despite the fact that people ( teachers parents and peers) are always telling me how intelligent I am, I will amount to nothing. I've reverted back to my nothings wrong with me (insert dry whit) mode. Nothing at all to be horribly depressed about. And I'm serious. I've fucked things up worse than this without getting all depressed before. I wonder why I cant deal with something that earlier in life I would have been able to shrug off? It's days like this I wish I had a religion to fall back on. I envy people who have faith despite my making fun of them on a fairly regular basis. It's just a pang of jealousy I fear. Aw well too late to change who I am now. It really is. Bleh.
