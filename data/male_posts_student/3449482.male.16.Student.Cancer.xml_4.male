I told mu shi i did not do anything wrong liao but he say i lie... mu shi say he did not see any improve in my life, he say tat everytime he see me stoning he will say oh a pity Long Xiang... At tat time i wish to tel mu shi tat i wan to change and i tried alot of method to change myself... mu shi then say wat i should improve nw is my life not the way i serve or do things... He oso say tat my end is coming if i still don wan to change... at the end he told me to do a prayer, at tat time i donno wat to pray acutally i wish to pray like tis " God pls help me and guide my way, God i'm sure U kno wat i hav done for my life if i don wan to change how would i go and think of so many solution to change myself? God when heard tat mu shi say i should change my life, i kno tat i hav wasted my effort cos all these days i tried my very best to change the way i serve and do things but.....nw all gone nv God i still wish to thank you for using mu shi to talk to me telling me to change my life, pls continue to bless and let me do things tat makes U happy... In Jesus name i prayed, Amen! After talking to mu shi i sat down at a corner and think...I did not do anything wrong but why mu shi say i lie??? i do wan to change or else why i tried to change the way i serve and do things? Hmm... nw i should put my focus on my life!!!
