Oh well... at least ganyan siguro talaga ang buhay.  Oo nga pala, I'm not sure but I may be going to Manila this sem break. The Commerce Dept. is going on a week-long tour of Northern Luzon and we'll be stopping in Manila for a day, I think. If ever I do go with it, I'll tell you about it.  We're all a little insane. If you're too sane for words, you know that you're the most insane.
