Particularly the ones at the front of your mouth. They're sharp, aren't they?  Guess what those are for. Take a good, LONG guess.  Give up? The answer is MEAT. You PETA-nazis seem to forget that we are SUPPOSED to be eating meat, because that is how the world spins. Don't get me wrong, we are supposed to eat vegetables too, but it doesn't work with just one. Every single vegan i know is reeeeeeeeeeally skinny and unhealthy-looking, and i imagine it's kinda along the lines of eating too much sweets, and not enough vegetables. I guess it's half-opposite.  That's ****ing it, i'm starting the "for every animal you don't eat, i'm eating two" program. Anyone want me to sponsor them?  P.S. only when cows become endangered will I say "ooh... maybe we should slow down..."   -one of my posts on the Blue Man Forum, on a thread talking about the PETA ad campaign that compared slaughtering cattle to nazi concentration camps.  I usually keep this and the forum separate, but i thought that the above was good, and that it'd turn a few heads X-P
