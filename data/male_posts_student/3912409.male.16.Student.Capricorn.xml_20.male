This morning I had an orthodontist appointment at 9:00, which means I had to get up early :(. I was playing around on the computer till some one came on MSN. Eventually I had to leave to go to tennis, and when I got there, there was some thunder. I think we were only there for an hour, I did get to play one game, and I bageled him :p which means he didn't win a single game against me. It eventually started to rain, so tennis got cancelled and I had to bike home in the rain :(. When I got home I started talking to Cookie (big suprise there, :p). There was some cheek licking and rib poking invovled, lol. I played around with some taskbar customizing program type thingy, but I deleted it.... but I'm not sure why........... I want it back now, lol. I was eating trailmix and I spilled it on my floor :(... so I just started eating off of the floor :p.  I have to do some packing soon, but I don't think I have very much stuff to pack other than my clothes. I'm hoping to do some shopping while in calgary.... lol and that's most likely going to happen. I don't know when my next blog post will be but... ummmmm... just wait in suspence because I know reading my blog is the best thing that will happen to you during the entire day.  to be continued...
