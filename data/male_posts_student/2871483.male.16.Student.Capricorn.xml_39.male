Second period, algebra.  Mr. Morris seems to have cooled down from that little terror spry I had the other day.  Thats good.  He was wearing a shirt that looks like he took from my closet.  Third period, biology.  Boring test, then watched five minutes of Gattaca.  Lunch, boring, played thirteen, thats about it.  Forth, Spanish, the only other cool class today.  We finished up our fasion show.  It was hilarious.  Fifth, History, semi amusing.  Cranny ranted about nobody helping out for nothing.  I found out I had four unexcused absences in his class.  (WTF, I haven't even been gone four days!)  Sixth, stupid fucking English.  Finished Julius Caesar, and then made a rubric for our papers.  We had to fill in what a paper would look like in six different catagories for 8 points and 6 points, following her 10 ones (I am NOT kidding.)  What a stupid fucking idea.  You can tell she had nothing planned.  Meh, hung out with Brionna, Michael and Kaylee for 45 minutes when we were supposed to be doing the assignment.  Whatever, win win.  -  I finally have Video Killed the Radio Star's first part down.  I'm pleased, it's kinda hard.  -  For some very odd reason, the OC pulled me in.  My sister had it on, and I just sat down and started to watch it.  All of a sudden, I start getting interested!  Holy crap!  It really is like a soap opera!  It's insane.
