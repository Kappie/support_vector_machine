Anyway, here's the line you've all been waiting for. It's now official,   Mike Garvey is in the market for a chick.    . . .  Hehe, I love pretending to be egotistical from time to time. Yea... "Do you need anybody? I just need someone to love. Could it be anybody? I want somebody to love."  Can't express it any better than that. I've just finally tapped into a love for other people that was buried beneath my fucked-up emotional shell, and i need someone to share that with...   In other news, I'm getting a cell phone tomorrow finally. Only 2 months after the promised date... figures.  Ok, i'm gonna go do soemthing else right now.  cy'all later.
