Spent  Just trying to pay the rent.  Guess I’m not good enough To make it through the day. Well I’ve not got enough To see your sweet, sweet face. But there’s not near enough Pain in this place To keep me from trying to  See your sweet, sweet face.  But paying the rent  Doesn’t suffice when You’re looking for something more to life. Maybe a something more  Could be a someone else. Seeing you walk toward me, I’ve found something more. But this can’t be true This has to be real life.  Guess I’m not good enough To make it through the day. Well I’ve not got enough To see your sweet, sweet face. But there’s not near enough Pain in this place To keep me from trying to  See your sweet, sweet face.  I never knew that life could taste so sweet But now that you’re here I find myself staring down at my feet  Going faster than I ever thought they could I see the pictures of you and me, Wondering now, what could there be To keep your feet from walking with me?  Guess I’m not good enough To make it through the day. Well I’ve not got enough To see your sweet, sweet face. But there’s not near enough  Pain in this place To keep me from trying to  See your sweet, sweet face.     here ends the love making session
