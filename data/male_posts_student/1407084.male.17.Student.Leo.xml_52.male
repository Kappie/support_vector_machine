I am starting to think all my friends who used to care don't care anymore. Don't be that way, please! You don't even have to solve anyone's problems or anything..  all you have to do is listen to what people have to say . It seems that some of us are too wrapped up in your own lives to take note that others are falling apart around us as well. I know I am... how about you? Simply by listening, we can help others.. and help ourselves.
