He was sleeping, from school all the way there. And he had never been to my house before! So we got off, leaving him on the bus.   We then proceeded to my house to start on the project. We tried calling James, but his hand phone was off! lol.. At like about 5 p.m, he called from his home. Apparently, he had woken up only a few stops later, finding out that we were all missing. He got off, at Jon's house. He went to his block, but could not remember which floor it was. 'Was it 10 or 12?'. It was 8!!!... He wanted to see if our shoes were there. But the problem was that jon normally puts shoes in the house and not outside. LOL.   So in the end, James just went home.... Awww... so sad...   We did quite a bit of the project... Not much progress in 1 1/2 hours. Yay not much homework due tomorrow...
