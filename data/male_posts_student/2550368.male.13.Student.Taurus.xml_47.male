Firefox is the new name of the project (Once named Phoenix) so heres the deal: 0.0-0.5 Phoenix (I THINK) 0.6-0.7.1 Firebird 0.8-> Firefox  Well im unable to download Firefox for some reason.. I dought that they got slashdoted because  of  urlLink this story .  My current fav. Red VS Blue Episode #20  - Jeff PS:  urlLink new sbemail  (good one)   Update  Clicking on Mozilla Firebird Help I see: Getting hit too hard from this new firefox release. Try another mirror.  -Spunknetwork Management   I guess I was right. Wow.. Even mozillaZine Forums are offline for repair. I didn't think sites like these would be with poopie hosts.. Its called RackSpace/ServerBeach/Server4You.. get them!
