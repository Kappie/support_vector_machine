Both were easy, but a lot of the questions on the English exam were very subjective and had multiple possible answers.  Whatever, not like I really need an A on it.  After exams I went to the magnet (special program I'm in) picnic, which was worse than I expected.  That's pretty bad, because I expected it to suck.  The only reason I went was because I wanted to play in the freshman-sophmore vs junior football game, which we couldn't have due to rain.  So I left after an hour and a half since my dad was off because of Reagan's funeral.  (I'll get into my disgust of all this nonsense with the Reagan funeral later.)  Tonight my dad and I had tickets for the Orioles vs Giants game.  We get to Baltimore, spend $7 for parking, $2 for peanuts, and my dad buys a $6 slice of pizza, and THEN they cancel the game.  What fun.  Not bad being in Baltimore anyway, but kind of a bummer.  Well that's it for tonight.  I'm actually going to try and relax a little after all this stress with exams.
