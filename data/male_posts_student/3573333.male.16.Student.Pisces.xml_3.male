How do we cope? That is the big question. Some are just mentally capable of usually their own will power. Some are not so fortunate. Some contemplate suicide. I can tell you now that it got to a time where it was an option I was contemplating.  Myself like some, decided to take up smoking. For a while it worked, and for a while it didn't. But it did get addictive. And let me tell you, that's not a good thing. I know quite many people who smoke and everyday they tell me that they hate it. Then why do it? Well its like Pringles - once you oop you cant stop. But luckily for myself, I have limited it to 2 decks a week to a one or two here and there every once or so weeks.   People, don't smoke, don't try any drugs, and most of all, don't do anything crazy. I've been there and trust me, it's not a path that you want to cross. You will meet people who seem ok at first, then drag you in then thats when you're fucked. The best way, I think to cope with stress, is to do what I'm doing. Make a journal or a diary. Write. Let your emotions run wild.   If writing isn't your forte, then the next best thing is to talk. Talk to someone. Your best mate, your girlfriend/boyfriend, the guy next door, anyone who is willing to listen. It's good when you have someone to listen. Even if you think it's the last person you thought that would listen. At school, it's Ms G. Shit, sometimes I even skip class to go and see her. Well she is a psychologist so it does help!  If you think your going to have trouble getting that TER you want, or getting that 50/50, or you're thinking that you're going to fail something, your talking shit. If you are studying, then you're doing something. Your only going to fail when you say so if you're sitting on your ass watching tv saying it. Anyhow, I'm crapping on, and I really hope you take what I have to say seriously, and if you are like me, struggling to cope with the pressures of life, just always remember that God is always watching over you - so that means if you want to get in the good books, don't try any crazy shit
