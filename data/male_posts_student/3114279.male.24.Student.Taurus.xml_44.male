      Yo yo yo, it's me, the internetless random poster. I have nothing of interest to say right now, so if your name is Jane and you complain about such things you may as well stop reading right now. I just wanted to post something so that people wouldn't think this is a solo act. I mean, who else would be the Laurel to Nick's Hardy? The Keaton to Nick's Chaplin? The Yin to Nick's way too Yang? Well, Spider-Man 2 is very awesome, and I'll have to recommend it to everybody right off the bat. Conversely, Dodgeball sucks really hard. Seriously, somebody got paid WGA minimum $35,000 to write this script at the very least. That's ridiculous! I could have written this standing on my head. Hell, I could have written this with somebody else standing on my head. What an awful piece of shit. I'm sorry, Nick, but your boy Vince Vaughn has a stigma on his hands that he will be hard pressed to wash off. On the bright side I paid nothing for it, so I'm not too mad.  I don't get people who take their minimum wage jobs so seriously. Take for example, say... Publix. Terrible job! Nobody in their right mind would want to stay there, right? And nobody in their right mind would definitely care about procedure or any other stupid crap, right? Well, the other day, bogged down by homework and studying I decided to call in to work. I'm not the president. I'm not the ER doctor. I'm a fucking bagger. So the manager sighs, pauses, and then, legitimately angry, says "Man, this is the second time you've done this." True, I called in 5 months ago, but it is the second or fifth time I've called in, but then he says "You called in last week, too." I say he is mistaken, after which point he grumbles and says goodbye. I didn't call in last week, but if I did, who cares? It's a damn grocery store. It's a stupid job. I'm not working my way up the corporate ladder. Urgh. The story didn't exactly go all of the places I wanted it to, but that's sometimes ok.  My roommate has left, and once again I am scared of ghosts and murderers. I was certain by the time I was in my mid twenties this fear would have subsided, but not so. Now, don't get me wrong, I would like to see a ghost, but I would prefer a notice via mail explaining exactly when, where, and how I will see said ghost. Tuesday, the 23rd, 8pm. They will not look fucked up, rotten, spooky, or ghastly in anyway, will enter through the west wall and exit through the east, and there will be no children's laughter, music, or anything else twisted, and definitely no eye contact. Simple. Oh well. I've probably told that to everybody who reads this blog anyway.
