A : No  B : Why?  B : Are you scared of rejection? *silence*  C : You're such a retard sometimes, Adam  B : Yer or something along those lines.  *5 minutes later*  B : It's not happining any more because noone is going Geez, Bri. You don't even like Tara and Emma. And if you like them enough to go to the movies with them, you should be able to call them yourself.  It's not like Tara likes me any more anyway, considering I've changed 'n' all.   And whoever is commenting, please sign your posts with your name, or create and/or login with a Blogger ID. It taked 30 seconds FFS.  Fuck the world...!  On another note, my new template is coming along nicely, although I can't keep my mind on one thing for long enough to finish it. Ah well... I don't care.  Last night I had a dream where everyone read what I write on here. Not like theres nothing interesting, but meh. I don't remember what happened, either.   This morning/afternoon was Fresh Obsession training at Abbot St. I won a $5 Woolies gift voucher. I bought Tim Tams. They were mediocre.
