Nobody else came, but it was lots of fun and we finally made an original. Can't Stop is so much fun to play, we all love it. After band practice, I went out to dinner with my family and grandma to Iorio's in Hauppauge which is right near my Grandma's home. Iorio's sucks, it used to be Giordano's which was awesome. The waitress forgot to get me another coke. My cousins live like half a mile away from my grandma and it's weird, they live in Hauppauge yet they go to SHS. Weirded out. Now I'm home, with homework done, and I'm watching some TV, then sleepin. ZZ Top Goodnight.  Take a break.exe... enter, ahhh hello my winged friend...I'm gonna go watch that Take A Brake program, you know you can download it on the site, Heaton taught me how, it's actually really relaxing. If you haven't a clue what I'm talking about, just friggin' im me.
