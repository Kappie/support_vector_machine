Today I woke up late, took my sister to her best friends house (sleep-over time) and then went to Subway to get lunch. On the way to do all of this I waited for 30 minutes to get down the road! I was pissed! The only road from my house to civilization was turned into a one way road today! PISSED! They thought it would be funny to pave the road, which is cool, except for the fact that they did'nt let ya drive on it for 30 minutes! I was not a happy camper....Anyways, this is sort of interesting and worth a thought or four...  Since America is typically represented by an eagle. Saddam should have read up on his Muslim passages.... The following verse is from the Quran (The Islamic Bible) Quran (9:11) - For it is written that a son of Arabia would awaken a fearsome Eagle. The wrath of the Eagle would be felt throughout the land of Allah and, while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced; for the wrath of the Eagle cleansed the lands of Allah; and there was peace. (Note the verse number!) Yep listen to the Muslum Bible thing folks, the wrath of the eagle! Go us, its our birthday! kinda....Anyways, I think that is interesting. Oh yeah and I live in the most liberal town in our world, yep...I fit right in.....take that liberal folk!  oOo...I found these interesting tidbits online...and now I'm sharing with you...so read on you...
