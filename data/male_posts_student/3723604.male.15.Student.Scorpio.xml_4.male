Yes, because that means the weekend, which means my family will be hovering around the house, trying to get me to "do things" like laundry, trash, drugs etc...   I'm also lacking in typing ability, since I had to rewrite that last sentance about four times. (and this one about three).  I better quit posting daily, that would bring people to accept it and check in obsessively waiting to see what Reb posts next. They'd come to my site twice an hour everyday to see if I've updated, and if I haven't they'd send rutheless, violent e-mails forcing me to post out of self-pitty for neglecting my blog.   Cripes, I never knew something like this could be such a burden.
