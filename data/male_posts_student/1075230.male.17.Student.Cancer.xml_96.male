Eric got what he came for... the only card he needed and wanted...finally found someone willing to sell.   Went to the daycare at 9:00am today, unexpectedly stayed till 2:00pm. Mostly just hung around watching how things are done. The kids had free time, went outside, played some games, sang some songs, and then half went tobogganning and half stayed for archery. I went with the tobogganning group since the park is near my house, and it was nearing 2:00pm. Pretty interesting, I actually talked more to the other counsellors than I did last year. Though still not much.    Came back home and wasted the rest of the day, need to finish unit before I sleep though. I finished one math unit yesterday... yay for me ^^;;    Ah... will volunteer 9 - 2 again tomorrow, then I'll have my 10 hours from the daycare. My total is 31 hours and counting ^^b   ~Chronos
