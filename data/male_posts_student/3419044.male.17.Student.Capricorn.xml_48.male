So we tried finding Scott cause we saw him driving earlier and thought it'd be fun to go watch it on the corner of the town.  We ran around trying to catch him.  He did a U-turn about 20 feet away from us and drove off.  It was frustrating.  We eventually met up with him, as he was driving with Pete.  He picked us up in the Celica and we drove in that for abit.  We then went to Scott's truck and drove around.  The storm was immaculate!  Lightning every 5 seconds, serious.  It was raining crazy too.  The power had gone out and the streets were pitch black.  It was a fun night for once...
