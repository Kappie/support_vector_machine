It seems that speaking gently to the slopes, pleading for tolerance and patience really only angers them and accelerates the force by which you are slammed into the ground. Repeat this phrase: Gravity is not my friend. Gravity is not even the nice man who offers me candy if I'll get in the car with him. Gravity is a soulless reaperlike motherfucker hell bent of mangling my body for the sole purpose of entertaining those around me. I still caught some of that air though. Fuck yeah.  A sad occurrence: it seems that one of my frequent trips down the hill on parts of my person other than the board has caused a recurrence of the injuries I sustained in a car accident over a year ago. There's a knot behind my left shoulder that honestly feels like someone is grinding their knuckles into my back. In reality, the only thing that will relieve this pain in someone grinding their knuckles into my back. That's Alanis-level yo.
