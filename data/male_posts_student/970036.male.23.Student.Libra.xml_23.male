If the World Wide Web were, in fact, a real superhighway, like the marvels of modern engineering sorely lacking in Edmonton but found in abundance in quaint US cities like Seattle, there would be rest stops every 5 metres with magazine racks overflowing with hardcore pornography and floors littered with  pop out  advertising inserts. There would be access to bathrooms, but in order to actually open the stalls and use the toilet you'd need to pay for a 12-month subscription, where you'd then discover that an upgraded  premium  membership is necessary to get your hands on a few precious squares of 1-ply. To top it off, even regular vaccinations wouldn't save your sorry ass from catching a virus each and every time you took the motorcar out for a Sunday drive.  Aw hell, I should be studying anyways.    Currently listening to: Irina  MNO - 1000 Pieces
