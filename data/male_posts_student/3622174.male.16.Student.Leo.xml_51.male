Alright, in the past week, I have reviewed two different media players, WinAmp 5.1, and jetAudio.  Both players received a 4.5/5 on the old scale, so, we need to narrow it down to determine which of the two media players is the better one.  The main disadvantage of WinAmp is that it can be slow sometimes, compared to jetAudio.  The main disadvantage of jetAudio is that the skins aren't all that great.  Each of the players has other disadvantages, too, but, we're not going to get into that here.  We're just going to talk about their advantages.  On the positive side of WinAmp, its a highly open ended media player, with some of the most awesome customization options. On the positive side of jetAudio, you get all sorts of little gadgets and things, like a clock, alarm, and burning capabilities, and, you can use several different media formats.  Both WinAmp and jetAudio have web broadcasting programs (jetCast from jetAudio, Shoutcast from WinAmp).  The better one, to me, at least, is jetCast, because it is the more open ended, and easier to use program.  WinAmp is a great player, but, I think I have to stick by and say that jetAudio is the better, despite the skins looking kind of bad sometimes.   -------------------------- Daily Wrap Up- July 1st, 2004  Well, today was kind of split up due to my yearbook meeting, but now, we've gotten everything squared away.  Today was the beginning of the new rating system, and also, the cleaning of the monthly review archive.  Remember, to find something old, CHECK THE ARCHIVES.  And, also, be sure to check the archives when the bagel.tech Gmail Giveaway begins, because the codes will be hidden all over the place.  And, with that said, here is today's wrap up:  Today's site of the day was 1up.com.  This site recieved a C+ because there are problems with the content system, and some of the flashy thingys aren't supposed to work.  The new design is nice, but has its flaws, and the User Pages could be better looking, and could contain less of your personal information.  Again, the game received a C+.  Today's download was ObjectDock.  This program features an easier way to open programs than minimizing everything you're doing.  It's easy to use, and it looks great.  ObjectDock received an A+.  Today's game review was Go Bingo on Uproar.  This game was so bad, that it was saddening to even give a decent review.  It's a horrible game, however, you can play for iCoins.  Go Bingo received an F.  And finally, today's feature was the bagel.tech War: WinAmp vs. jetAudio.  Both players received a 4.5 out of 5, and were both great players, however, I do recommend jetAudio more than WinAmp.  Thats it for bagel.tech today.  Here's what to expect:   SITE: GameSpot DOWNLOAD: Avant Browser GAME: What Word TIP: Various tips in Avant Browser   See you tomorrow here on bagel.tech.  Until then, tonight's Blog of Bagel update is going to be later than normal, so you may not see it until tomorrow morning...where there will be another new one then, too.
