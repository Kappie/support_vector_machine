I go to school and am bored.  I am hungry by 3rd hour.  4th hour rolls around and lunch.  5th hour and 6th.  6th's much different though because I've got Curt and Jory to amuse me.  Weirdos.  Yeah today Curt decides to wrap toilet paper around Jory.  Nice.  Then weight lifting every other day.  When I get home I do the same thing.  Watch an hour of Seinfeld and then some other programming.  Eat some dinner then more TV.  I usually check online bulletin boards and avoid doing my homework.  By then it's about 10-11:30.  Then, if I have to do homework, I do.  If it's something I can put off more, then I do.  My life is beginning to become pathetic.  And by the time the weekend rolls around I usually sit around and do nothing but instead of regular dinner we usually have pizza every once and a while on Friday's and I end up checking boards all day/night and playing video games all weekend.  I don't have a job.  I don't have many friends.  I don't do things on weekends.  All I do is avoid homework and play sports.  What the hell?  I would say I could pass for the typical jock minus the social life.  I suck.
