Somewhere it says that I'm a loner, this is true, but that doesn't mean that I don't have friends, I just prefer to be alone, and I prefer dark things over light things.  I have really sensitive eyes, even though I can't see more than 3 feet in front of my face without my glasses.  I have established several things about my life at school:   1) All my teachers hate me (No Brainer)   2) I think my teachers hate me because of my brothers   3) Half of my teachers are sexist.  I have come of with the conclusion of the last one because 3 of my teachers that I have every year always treat the girls with greater respect.  I don't blame them with the times that they grew up in (1950-60's, yes, some of my teachers are 50 years old, one is 59).  But, that's no reason to fail someone because they're a guy.  Recently a book report was due with, a biography book report.  I had accidentally picked up a "bibliography" and my teacher wouldn't except it.  Another person (a girl) had one, and it was a bibliography. 98 my teacher wrote down in her book.  Now it could be because of my brothers, and I'm still thinking on that.  Hm....Kinda stumped right now....I guess I'll go finish up my homework.    Later.
