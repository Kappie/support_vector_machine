Visit    SelectSmart.com/RELIGION          I sort of expected this to be my number one match, since in theory, it's the religion that gives me the most mobility of thought without having to worry about the good of my immortal soul.  I guess, that's slightly re-assuring even though, I'm still pretty attracted towards Baha'i which was the religion I agree with like 80 % which would put it at third (Mainline to Liberal Protestant was my second).  I guess, comparitive religion would be something good to take in college.    Dreams of Heaven  Last Night, I had a dream. A dream. A dream of heaven.  In it, I saw a city. A city with roads that,  were always smoothe. A city, where it was always day. A city, where I never saw anyone asking for money. A city, where the town hall was a work of pure art. A city, where all houses were beautiful. A city, where everyone was rich, and never went hungry.  But, I cried, when I saw the city. A city, with no temples. A city, with no prayer. A city, without a soul. A city, where money was all anyone loved.  And then, I truly saw,  for when I said "Oh God!" It rang hollow. It rang silent. It rang with my sorrow!  For, I knew  where I was, apart from God, from hope,  and from Faith. I was in Hell.
