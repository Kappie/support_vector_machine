I dont much expect anyone else to be reading this so I might as well be talking to myself, its currently eleven o'clock, my bro and his friend have just gone to bed probably to smoke themselves tupid on illegal narcotics. I'm sitting here dripping wet in a green towell from a late bath listening to "The Show Must Go On" by Queen.  There's an orange light flashing on the MSN Messenger window... ohh great, my web "girlfriend" who is 12 or something and thinks im "fit" is trying to talk to me... wonder if she'll accuse me of cheating on her or not...    Ohh, now listening to one of my favourite artists... David Hodges... if you havn't heard of him he used to be in Evanescence and helped write a lot of their material for the first album... he writes solo material of a Christian theme, lots of it featuring the vocals of Amy Lee  Im almost certain that I've ranted on for too long... probably giving you all many questions you'd like to ask, well I'll hopefully be answering them as we go. I'm quite a weird and wacky and funny person if you get to know me.  Anyway, I'm loosing the plot... Will write again tomorrow \ later \ when I can be arsed!  Much Love  Dxx
