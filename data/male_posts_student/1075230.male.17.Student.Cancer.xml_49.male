I know my parents would really be disappointed if I didn't...*looks around* I'm quite sure I won't do as well as last year... *groans* last year I placed first and got 128....    On to more cheerful news, International Night is coming... origami and kendo practises are needed! Hopefully, we can try to not make a fools of ourselves on stage.   Yesterday I went from 8pm to 4am reading "Alanna: the First Adventure" and "Wind in the Door". Ehheh... ^^;; gomen hoshi-chan.. it was just that it was... so... interesting.   Ah... just went outside to get something (mailperson put an envelope for my sister in my neighbour's mailbox instead)... noticed how clear the stars are from where I am, even though there's still quite a bit of light pollution. The snow and the stars look really nice at night... heck, what other time are you supposed to see stars? ^^;; welll, let's all decide to try to catch up, if I ever get there... I'll try to pull you ahead with me keane... until then... I must prevent myself from drowning... gomen.. no position to help anyone...yet.   Ah... tomorrow is my  urlLink site's  first official anniversary. I used a different background just to celebrate it!    ~Chronos
