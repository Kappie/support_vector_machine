We would sleep in cabins at Pine Summit Conference Grounds, visit the snack shop, play soccer, football, volleyball, basketball, paintball, climb ropes courses, climbing walls, do the zipline, go to chapel each night, and compete one of the other teams in daily games, which had odd names, but were very fun, such as Human Foosball, Tennis Volleyball, Human Pinball, Earthball, Teamball, Which Way Baseball, and so forth. Perhaps the most interesting thing at the camp is the Cabin Inspectors, which are Awana leaders that make sure your cabin is clean. (They are incredibly strict.) They would mark your cabin grade down if your shoes were pointed the wrong way; your sleeping bag zippers must point to the wall, your floor must be swept, your suitcases under the beds, and so on. Then at dinner, in front of the whole camp, (about 550 campers, along with many counselors and Pine Summit Staff) a lady who was known as the cabin inspector would announce the winning cabin, along with other noteworthy cabins, as well as read notes that different campers wrote to her. (Actually, the cabin inspectors were men, not this woman, but all the information was passed to her.) So one day, some friends from my cabin and I put a can that read “Old Fashioned Peanut Brittle,” which I had received from my aunt and uncle a few weeks before, on a chair in the cabin with a note saying that the peanut brittle was for the cabin inspectors. In the can, instead of peanut brittle, was two springs covered in a colored sheet. When anybody opened the can expecting peanut brittle, two springs would shoot out of it. Well, the cabin inspectors fell for it, and the lady on the stage brought the can on with her and opened it on stage in front of everybody. We all had a good laugh, and my peanut brittle is now well known among Awana clubbers.
