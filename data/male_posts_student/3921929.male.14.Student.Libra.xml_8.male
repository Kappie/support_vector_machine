I was going to go to the skatepark, but I couldn't because my parents cooked chicken and rice, and I  had  to stay home to eat that! Damn it was good, lol. So Matt came over and I tried to get him to boardslide, but he couldn't and I don't even think he really tried.  Scott and Kevin got into another fight today. Scott won ten dollars in a bet with Kevin and Kevin said he wouldn't give it to Scott. Then Scott started making fun of Kevin for being fat and Kevin made fun of Scott for being gay (which he isn't). That's all they do to each other when they're mad, and I always laugh at them, lol. So when Kevin invited me to the skatepark, he didn't want Scott to come, just to make him even madder.  I really want to go back to the skatepark - I think I'm obsessed. Next time I go there, I'm gonna ask how old I have to be to work there and if they will hire me. It would  kick ass  to work there! You get to skate there for free and you get paid for it! The only thing you have to do is watch other people and make sure they paid to get in, and you have to get help if someone gets hurt. That's basically no work, because people rarely get hurt there. If I can't get a job there, I'm gonna try to get one at Pac Sun at the mall or Gamestop with Alec, but I think you have to be 16 to work at those places. I'll have to wait two years since I'm only 14 but oh well.  I guess that's all I have to say for now. Wow, I wrote a lot compared to my other tiny posts!
