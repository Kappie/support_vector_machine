So after doing a worksheet and some reading out of my propaganda book, it was my turn to go through. I got my height (5' 7.5") and weight (152) measured by an old lady who really just needed somebody to hold her, and tell her everything was going to be all right. Next station: blood pressure, and a barrage of insults. Finally: the BIG ONE. CHOLESTEROL AND GLUCOSE. They used this little poker thing and then made fun of me for bleeding a lot. She puts the samples in the little machines. And it says my cholesterol is bloody 157. I know for a fact it is at least over 200, probably closer to 250.  I have high cholesterol and am damn proud of it. I feel sorry for all the kids who have been raped of a proper diagnosis (well actually I don't). I sit down, feeling utterly drained, and pondering the true efficiency of the health system in the wonderful United States. Bang. My friend hits the floor up on stage. He now lays dead in a mausoleum. They killed my only friend.
