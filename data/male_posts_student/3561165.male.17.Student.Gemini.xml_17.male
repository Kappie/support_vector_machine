I spent Monday and Tuesday night decamped on the futon in Oli's room watching music videos, and Wednesday and yesterday were expent in a similarly slobbish fashion. Any kind of productive thoughts within my mind have been abnegated by the dull thudding pleasure of sitting around on one's arse. How borgeoise, how boring. Yesterday however, was a revelation for me in another sense. I began replaying Sonic and Knuckles, which in my eyes is unparalleled in its achievements as a 2D platformer. The expanse, vision, ideas and the music (Lava Reef zone!) are mindblowingly good, even after all these years. The only criticable area is that of the length of the game, which could be better (somewhat ameliorated by the fact that there are two selectable characters, but still), but I'm not gonna lambaste what I consider to be a salaciously lovely game. I intend upon playing all four of the Mega Drive platformers, and upon their completion by tonight. I've also downloaded the Razorlight album, and the Ordinary Boys album, which are both good, the latter being the Britpop revival which it is claimed to be. After ten years, britpop seems quitepointless and quite banal now. I guess the world was more receptive due to the comedown after the flighty heights of acid house, and the breakup of the Stone Roses; people were taking ecstacy by the wheel-barrow load, no wonder they were dejected and just willed to be 'ordinary'. Also, I've had a major computer cleanout with some fun administrative tools. Deleted erroneous links in the registry, cleaned out the recycler, gone through with ad-aware about three time, cleaned up links on my desktop, uninstalled a load of unused programs, defragmented the hard drive, etc etc. I think it has reclaimed me in the region of 5Gb of space, which is extremely welcome considering that my music collection is soon going to be overspilling over to my D drive. Makes quite a change from a couple of weeks ago when my computer was a spyware whore, infected with the Parite. B virus and basically fucked. I didn't watch the BNP programme on BBC2 last night, I think I'm fully conversant with the fact they're racists and I don't need substantiation to enfore the fact that their preposterous claims of not being racist are untrue. Anyway, Sonic calls.
