I've just been busy since we got back because the day after I got back I had to go straight to work and help an old lady that I landscape for move stuff to her new house and trim some of the trees. Anyway, today I'm going to the guitar shop this morning so I won't get locked in like the last time I almost did because it was 45 minutes after they closed and I never even noticed the lights went out. lol. I might be mowing a larger place today (about 20-30 acres or so) but I'm not sure yet, if I don't do that, I'm going back over to that lady's house and I'm going to put up her blinds for her. It's about 8:00 am... I've just got to... wait around till my dad wakes up. Imagine how much time I'm wasting... what if I could get all of that time back before I die... The property of time conservation... tsk tsk... hmm. Yeah... well, I'll post this then I'm going to check the forums at Harmony-Central. com and hipforums...   TV - A show on the history channel about Galileo  Music - Last night I listened to REO Speedwagon, Crosby Stills and Nash, and Neil Young... oh, and Mississippi John Hurt.
