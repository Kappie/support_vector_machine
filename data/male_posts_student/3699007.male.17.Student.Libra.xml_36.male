It was the worst concert I have ever seen in my life, bar none. Blues Traveler, I have always heard, is great in concert, but friday night, they SUCKED. Saturday, I went to the outlet mall in Dawsonville with my parents and I got a lot of clothes for school, so that was fun. And now I just got in from cutting the grass and I've gotta be at the arena at 2:45.
