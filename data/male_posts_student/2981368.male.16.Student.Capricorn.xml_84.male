"arghs i can't stop eating these plain potato chips and i hate plain potato chips but for some reason i really like them right now"  "Eli (9:41AM): LIKE A STONE Ben (9:46AM): eh? Eli (9:46AM): nothin' man. nothin'"  One day until English exam....ARRRGGGHHHH!!!! SHIIIT SHIIIT SHIIIT  I have a bad feeling its the poetry one as well. And aparently that includes the first 6 of 12 short stories. Which SUCK SOOO BADLY.  OK back to revision.
