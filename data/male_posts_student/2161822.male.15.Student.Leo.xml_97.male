I think god should be thanked one more time since Tuesday is our LAST DRIVER'S THEORY CLASS! Ah I love it. Except this weekend will be unfortunately plagued with bad weather (rain, snow, fireballs, hell and brimstone). But hopefully next week will be a little nicer. But now I'm going to stop writing this.  Listen to H.I.M.
