Also there are older guys dating younger girls and there is no real problem with that but it is the relationships that are thrown away because they want to decide that they want to date. But the love really was suppose to just really be a friend relationship, once you take the extra step then the entire relationship and then both people realize this and once they break up the relationship that they had before it goes with it as well. But also there relationships that work. When younger girls date older men they really don't think about the relationship long term, Especially if the age margin is big. Guys in highschool have one thing on their mind, Girls. Hormone are active and change behavior drastically. School is probably the last thing that we think about, other than finals. This segment is really for the guys, no offense to ladies at the moment but the more preppie the girl the less that you can trust them the more of a gut feeling that you have the least you can trust it. You need to wait there and let the women go to you. It is simple, girls and women are just as confused as you are about life at the moment. They aren't sure of certain actions and how to respond to different things. But the one thing that I have caught onto are facial expressions and body language, it isn't that hard to catch on. If you sit by a girl that may like you, you can tell from the expression of another girl that may be her friend that is trying to make eye contact with her. Look at their eyes the way they look. Simple "hints" so to speak to women is gibberish to guys. As much so I don't get it, especially when the idea of a hint in on the table, another girl has to tell you that a hint was there. Guys are totally different in behavior then girls, and everyone knows that. But it is the girl that spends 30 minutes to re-apply make up after gym or before school that bugs me. Girls don't need make up. It really doesn't make anyone prettier or better than anyone else, it just makes others unaware of your true colors. People should like you the way you are and if you have to act differently to become that person that it really shouldn't be worth it. Be your own person, fight back a little inside and stand tall!
