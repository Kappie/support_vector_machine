Basically the guys needed toilet paper but they bought (alchoholic beverages :) ) instead, lol, when it gets check at the register the lady asks, 'paper or plastic' of course the boys reply in pain - PAPER! hahaha.   i'm gonna' have to go with paper also, you can use it for book covers, and it doesn't tear as easily as plastic.  remember this is for extra credit so, you'll have to bear with it again. c-ya The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will
