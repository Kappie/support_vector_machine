This is directly related to my struggles that I told you about a long time ago. I think that Satan has started to feel me slipping from his grasps, so has started to attack me in another area completly.   I have always believed that God existed. Today though, during Biology, I felt that God didn't. That there was no way that He could and that really got to me for the rest of the day, whether I noticed or not.  I prayed to God for about a half hour, asking for understanding and knowledge on what to do. It may seem kind of odd that when I am doubting His exisistance I go to Him for guidance. That is easy to explain.  I know that it is Satan who is trying to get me to doubt and I know that God  does  exist, so I know that I can go to Him for help. It was only at certain times would I doubt God's existance.  One of the things that God revealed to me was that I could count on Him to help me. I sincerly cried for God's guidance and the Lord showed me what I needed to know. He strengthened my belief in God and showed me how I would know. Which leads me off to my next point.  I was lying on my bed, crying my eyes out, and I asked God a specific question: "Is Dominique hindering my relationship with You?" I got an immediate feeling of calm and completly stopped crying and knew right there that God was telling me something. This is where I am actually having problems the most. It could go both ways, that God was telling me "Yes" and calming me to get my attention or that He was telling me "No" and calming me to relax me. How would I possibly know? Well what I felt that He was saying was the latter, but I really need some insight. Anybody who reads this, please, either e-mail me or post a comment on any insight you might have. I really need it.  Anyways, I am doing much better now, but I am still kinda' hot. (it's really really stuffy in my room) Hope all of your guys' days are going well.
