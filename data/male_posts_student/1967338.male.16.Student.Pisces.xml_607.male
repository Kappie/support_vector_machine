So I accept the invite from michael, and he accuses me of folding. Thats exactly why I hadn't already come back! If I leave and come back, you're just going to make annoying comments about it. Cuz thats what you do. You're the Michael Christie of making annoying comments. So I always have to watch what I write so I don't write anything you can make an annoying assnark comment on. Well, I'm sick of it michael. I'm tired of standing up for someone who kicks me in the back of the knees so I fall back down.  I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....
