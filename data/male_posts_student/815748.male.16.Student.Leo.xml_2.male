Note: this is simply a preALmptory post; the next morsALs of ALformation will actuALly give AL what AL wants to know. By the way, this is moderately ALvanced Allish (the language of the Allish-speaking peoples) AL is speaking; the most ALvanced stuff can only be ALnderstood by two people. AL won't neccesALrily speak in Allish, at least not ALvanced Allish. For the first time, this is AL, signing off.
