She called me back a few minutes ago and she has been in Seattle for the day and was doing something with KING 5 (how ironic cuz that is what I am going to do now).  But since I have to leave now too I am going to leave the letter for her at her door somewhere and she is going to get it when she gets home.  I am both wildy nervous and excited at the same time.  However, I dare say I am fearing yet again for the worst.  I wish this was easier than it was.  But then again this is pretty much 4 years of feelings coming out all at once so it will take time for her to digest it all.  Goodbye and wish me luck!
