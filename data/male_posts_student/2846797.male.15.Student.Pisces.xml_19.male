We actually did something first time in a week in fourth. We started reviewing. My chemistry teacher is taking it way to easy on us. He started off by making the test only 30 questions then he decides to make one a freebie. After that he precides to tell us what each question is going to be on. And now for the rest of the week we are going to go over the stuff the questions are on. Did I mention that we get one page of notes, periodic table, and a sheet full of type of reactions and stuff like that. Fifth period we did nothing again. Sixth we had sub. Noth said there. Anyways worked some on Project *SoB* tonight. I also coded some of the LF Clan site tonight. I also watched The Ring. It's still gay. Yup anyways. I guess I'm going to update my iPod. BTW my iBook found is $940 away from its goal. Ooo... I also played some CSX tonight. I think I'm getting my touch back. I was owning almost all night even though team stacking is worse then it was when I quit the first time. Yup playlist is at 1200 songs BTW. Well till next time.
