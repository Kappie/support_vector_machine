The 1st few times I ask I get no response. After a few attempts, I break through. it turns out she got in a fight w/ her bestest friend. (this gets a bit confusing ) her mom's friend wants her to choose between hanging out w/ her or another group of friends she has. The mom does not like that group for some reason only God can decifer. The rest of that class was just spent getting details on what happened. Next period there is this guy that always bugs her. I knew today would be a bad day for that crap(I know from experience) so I used complex visual aids to show him how bad it would be if he pissed her off. I sit next to her in 4th period, so I noticed she was a little better , these things just make you happy don't they? (being able to see you're friends happier after they've been so down) . Now kids, there is are lessons to be learned from this:                                                               #1- never get people angry when they are already emotionally hurt.                                                                #2- When you don't know how someone feels in a bad situation, the best thing you can do is help out, be attentive,  and             comfort them as best you can. (good lesson for anyone who is bad at counciling friends in need..........ROBERT.)
