That was really really weird man! Scared me half to death! I was talking to people online and all of a sudden everything went dark! It isn't storming either and it happened at Elizabeth's house too which is right down the road. Interesting. I had to reset the router too! lol
 
I'm glad I took a leak about ten minutes before it happened or I would be changing boxers right about now! lol
