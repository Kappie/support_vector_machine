Performed by Crush 40 Written by Jun Senoue  Johnny Gioeli   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Verse 1 I don't care what you're thinking As you turn to me Cause what I have in my two hands Is enough to set me free I could fight the feeling To resist it over time But when it's just too much to take You sneak up from behind  Pre Chorus 1 Is it me, you say, you're looking for Let me show you who I am and what I'm here for... here for...  Chorus Try to reach inside of me, try to drain my energy Let me show you just what I'm made of Simple curiosity tries to take a bite of me Let me show you just what I'm made of now...  Verse 2 Like a million faces I've recognized them all And one by one they've become A number as they fall In the face of reason I can't take no more One by one they've all become A black mark on the floor  Pre Chorus 2 Is it me, you say, you're looking for Let me show you who I am and what I have in store... in store...  Chorus  Bridge You can take another life long try You can take another try...  Chorus
