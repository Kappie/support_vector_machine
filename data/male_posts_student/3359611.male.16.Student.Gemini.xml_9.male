Mrs Lunter, the Birmingham/Bath Satan was evil. Pure and simple. She also had, seemingly, powers gifted to her by some unknown, unnatural force.    

With her, an hour lesson would turn into five hours. In other hour long science lessons we might look at and write about a quarter of what we do in biology. Not a lesson to be drowsy for, or even mildly not with it.    


Added to this, she hated me. There were only three people in her class who she'd taught from year eight, and all three of us were not, as you might call it, perfect students. We were all capable, as she kept reminding us, in a voice you'd more expect to be saying something along the lines of 'Feeling lucky, Punk', but we had 'application difficulties'. This was the result of one major problem with our timetabling, which meant we had to hand in biology homework on a day we didn't have a lesson, a complex process for me even know, with my sieve-like memory, but for the year eight dave, with his lack of developed excuse ability, it was hell. I couldn't do it for the life of me, and could never find a reason I couldn't, except that I couldn't quite get my head around the concept, which apparently wasn't good enough. But yeah, she hated me then, and still does. I often, in the past two years, had to seek safety behind my rugby-playing friend Matt to avoid being asked every single question she could think of. Anytime I got one right, a grunt was heard. Anytime I got one wrong, I got a lecture on how intelligent I could be, if only I'd APPLY myself.   


And so, after five years of biology, and four years of heart attacks, stressed mornings spent working out what I was going to say, and lectures, and evil glances at parents evenings, I've finished with biology. Thats it. Five years of teaching, condensed into one hour and a half of exam. And at that, an hour and a half of a suprisingly easy paper. Up yours Mrs Lunter. In some ways I want to get an A* to prove I can apply myself, but in other ways, I don't, just to prove you wrong. Still, thanks for the Penguin Bar on my birthday, and the rare times we had when you weren't threatening me. I shall never forget you, nor you cruel jokes at me, and the amount of times I have described you as harshly as possibly, only to find you standing behind me. You, cruel, cold-hearted, yet oddly  effective  teacher. I know more biology off by heart than any other subject, yet you have caused me mor epain than any other teacher I ahve ever had. Except Mr Medhurst. But at least he has comic relief built in, in the form of his near overwhelming bulk.
