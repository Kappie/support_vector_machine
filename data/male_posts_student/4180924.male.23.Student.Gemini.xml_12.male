This medieval torture device the doc has me wearing is really throwing me for a loop and it just ain't a wonderful experience.  As if that weren't enough to deal with,  J  returned home last night. I cannot put into words how much that  sucks . I haven't divulged to him that he owes me a nice little chunk of cash, so tonight should be even more fun.  There was the obligatory 93.56 grocery bags that always accompany him when he returns from Cobb, which is either the equivalent of Eden or one step above that heavenly paradise.  Then he had to wash clothes - pretty weird when  you're returning from your parents' house...where you can use  THEIR  washer, dryer, water, detergent, etc. instead of your own. But nope, there was lots of cabinet and door slamming until about midnight. Wonderful.  One positive - I do think he finally realized that I just generally don't want to speak to him.  "Hey man. I'm back." "Great." "So how was your summer." "Fine." "Awesome...blah, blah, blah." "Okay." "yadda f****** yadda yadda" "Uh-huh." The conversation goes on like this for another minute or so until he realizes that I am grimacing in pain...at which time he decided to leave. I have never been especially proud of that ankle until that point.   Then, later:    "Hey man, have you heard that f****** Jet CD?" "Yep." "Man, that s*** is f****** awesome." "Yep." "How about blah-blah." "Yep." "Oh, yeah man, that s*** f****** rocks too." "Yep." "F******-a. I'll burn you a copy of that s***. It's f******* awesome." "Ok. I'm going to bed now."       Why?    Why must we deal with this utterly detestable human being? I just don't get it. If he weren't a 14-year old boy with NO social skills trapped in the body of a 23-year old, it might be a little different story. As it stands, however, that's the situation. But why?   In the words of LawDawg, damn, damn, damn.
