I haven't heard from her (my internet friend) for a long time and it's driving me nuts. I've never known anyone as nice as her.   Anyway, I watched Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban with two of my best mates today. We went to the mall extra-early in the morning (9.30 am), ate breakfast at Burger King and even before the ticket booths at the cinema opened, a LONG queue was already there for the Harry Potter movie.    My friends are really cranky too. They suffer from mood swings like I do.   I feel depressed frequently, but thank God that I am sane today. My favorite book is still the  Life of Pi .   I named my pet turtles Jesusvishnumuhammadbuddha (male) and Maryshivakaunyin (female) but my parents made me change their names to Mr. and Mrs. Potato because it's not good to "refer to God as an animal"   But isn't religion about loving God? Why can't I love God the way I want to?   Dang. I've gotta do my Moral project. And in case you're wondering, "Moral" is a really lame subject that only exists in Malaysian schools.
