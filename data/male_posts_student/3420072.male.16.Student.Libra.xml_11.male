I mean its not as though thinking about something is not worth doing but it doesnt come off as fresh an idea as one that you just think of at like just this second.   Emotions: what are they to me emotions and the way you feel are intertwined but completely differnt i mean you could feel bad has hell but you could be on top of the world emotion wise. to me emotions are a myth it is just some word on how you should feel at a particular feeling you have which i think is poppycock. i know i could be wroung but hey i'm open for sudgestions.   if i were to start my blog from scrath i think i would have to stucture it so it was user friendly but hey i dont really care how i come off to people i mean i'm not a talented writer so i can do big words like because i mean who really like to use the word because any way its a crap word.  so i thought you know i'm lying in bed just thinking about my life and i thought wouldnt it be great if i designed my own page and i thought that would be cool so bear with me at the current moment as i get my new page up and running.  well my mind is blank so i will have to think even thouugh to me it doesnt come out fresh but hats sometimesx what you have to do.    ciao
