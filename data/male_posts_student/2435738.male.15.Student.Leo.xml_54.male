Full-time report:- ITALY 0-0 DENMARK ::A good performance from the Danes as the Italians fail to break Denmark apart as what pundits expected. ::The whole Danish team did well while the Italian strikers(Vieri,Cassano,Del Piero  Totti) kept on missing and could not break the deadlock. ::A very normal match where this is Italy's most famous scoreline.  Conclusion:Italy must be the more disappointed lot as it is a match where they are expected to win.The Danes must be happy with the scoreline since Italy is the toughest in the group.Congrats to Denamrk who did really well while Italy must win against Bulgaria or Sweden in the next match to fufill their full potential.Adding on,i will say that Vieri should be dropped.He is old,slow and kept on wrong-timing his runs.Cassano mustn't be too rough or he will only get cards but hes one to look out for the future.  _::signin' off:UrCh!n::_
