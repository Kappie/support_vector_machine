It hasn't been long since my last hair cut, hence I fear that some day they'll delve too deep and I'll find a grey spongy matter sliding towards the floor obscuring the magic mens logo on it's gravitic trip. The other fear rooted deeply in the act of getting your hair cut is sucking up that first biting wide that violates the very essence of your scalp the exact moment you exit the barber shop. Frankly, fuck you mother nature. I've just had a straight razor and astringent applied to my neck and I really don't need you reminding me all my insulation is gone.  After that I made some phone calls and inquired (enquired? nah, no tabloid shit) about taking a test drive in the Pontiac Vibe, the Toyota Matix and the Mazda Protege5. The Pontaic folks were very polite and arranged one immediately. The Mazda folks said just walk in, we'll give you the keys. The Toyota folks told me to fuck off.  I'm not kidding.   Them "We don't have a test drive model"  Moi "What about a demo in your showroom?"   They "Nope"  Yours truly "One on the lot?"  Das Toyotes "Negatory"  Me-sah "Uh... One in for service? Pictures? Someone that has a decent lore level that can bard one up for me?"  Toyotacock "Fuck off"  Me "Uh...."  Spawn of Satan "...*dialtone*..."  I long for the days of yore... when Toyota sales people wore red, sharpened pencils and jumped in the fucking air and stayed there. These guys wouldn't even give me a half hearted hop if I meant I'd buy Five Matrices. Shit, the ones wearing red were only doing so cause they was representin for the Bloods.   Let's just say that I've ruled Toyota out as a choice, at least from the Cambridge location. Get this - they build the fucking things not 15 kilometres away and they STILL CHARGE $1010.00 Delivery. Fuckers. I'll pick it up thank you. Or rather I won't.  I took the Vibe out first, but I'll get to that second. The Protege5 has got a lot of go... it's a little rocket inside. Headroom is decent, backseats are a bit cramped. The cargo area can be enlarged by folding down the rear seats, the top flips forward and the bottom folds up. Carpet through the whole thing - the radio is okay. Comes in bright yellow which is pretty swank. Decent price. They were going to give me 2700$ for my little red car.  The Vibe on the other hand didn't just make me happy - it blew me away. I really really really like it (reused joke alert). You might say I'm a postive Vibe-rater. Thank you. I'll be here all night, tip your waitress try the veal.  The Vibe drove well, it looks great, it's the one I want. It sits high (higher then the Toyota with the skirt kit), it has more headroom than the Protege5, and it comes standard with most of the things I want. I mean, when I was specifying what I wanted I said "Base model, Power pack, Sports Pack, Rear Bumper protector, Bike/snowboard rack (to go on the standard roof rack) and rubber mats. As opposed to "nah, can't get that, doesn't come with it" etc. etc. etc.  More to follow
