I simply would not be studying the things that I am without listening to the music I listen to. My academic beliefs (as well as my identity) are inseparable from the fact that I grew up in southern California.  urlLink Postmodern  theory, ideas about consumerism,  urlLink spatial organization  and culture all come out of me listening to punk rock in Disney-centric Orange County in the 80s and 90s. Also the fact that I'm 23 should be a sign to academic people around me that I'm not at a point in my life where I want to stop having crazy youthful fun.   Screw it all... I went  urlLink glam , I plan on hitting the pit and stage diving at up coming shows... I'm gonna keep doing crazy shit I like rollerblading when drunk, and wearing band t-shirts.  Yesterday was cool though. The CTB conference was alright. Barrio was cool. Oh yea... I watched  Kill Bill vol. 1  w/ Melissa yesterday too. Then I ordered some late night stromboli... mmm... massive log of dough filled with meat and veggies.  ***
