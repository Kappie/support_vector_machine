Burton 1 still seems to respect their prior residents, so when they met my parents they were in awe and made my Dad tell tons of humiliating stories about 'the greatest hacks in MIT history'.  Then other people got weirded out when they were sneaking into the actual dorm hallways and taking pictures of their old rooms.  They built a new dorm. It's horribly ugly. It's supposed to look like a computer chip. Harvard Square is still the coolest place in the world, and Herrell's is still the best ice cream. See, it used to be a bank, and they renovated the vault and painted fishies in it, so you can go eat in there. Though it seemed a lot bigger when I was six.  Saw a bunch of peace rallys, and little "Fuck Bush" stickers on all the lamps. Speaking of lamps, my mother idiotically taught a bunch of MIT kids that the streetlamps outside their dorm are mercury-based, and if you bang against them the mercury condenses and they go out. Apparently this was what they did for entertainment in the 70's.  The Coop is still an intidimating bookstore with intimidating people.  And as I speak I am about to go to the Burlington mall for the first time in 10 years. This was the last place I went to before I left for Belgium, excluding the airport.  I'm weirded out.
