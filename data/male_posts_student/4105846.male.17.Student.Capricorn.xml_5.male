Feeling the teardrops falling in my shirt, that's when the feeling start to hurt, so now ill give you a chance to make up.  This isn't the first time I gave you a chance, because I believe in this thing called romance, so, I will give you another chance to make up. Weve been through a lot in the past, the memories are so vast, so, I will give you another chance to make up.  This will be your last second chance. To have an attitude that is enhanced. This will be your last second chance. I'll say be careful in advance.
