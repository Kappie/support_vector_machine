There are people out there who think my life is glamorous simply because my parents buy me lots of things, we have a nice house, we live in Castro Valley, etc...They terrible part of it all, is that I let them believe this. My life is great, sure, I'll be the first to admit it...but with money, comes problems. And with friendships, comes heartbreaks. I have no right to complain, and I know that...each time I type on this blog, I remember almost dying in Mexico...but the worst part of it all--I told myself something there that I promised myself I would do; that promise I made for myself was to be greatful for what I have. I remember the tears that streamed down my face when I sat in VBS with those poor children, and they would put their hands out, with deep hopes that we would give them just one dollar....I remember when we put out the gifts that I ordered at the last day of VBS, and they acted as if their lives were complete...how precious those children were. But now I look at myself, and I just think--what have I become? What have I done? What am I doing? Ron Chin even spoke about it at church on sunday...he was saying that God will not use prideful people to do his work, and the Lord must break those types of people before they can begin to do the Lord's work. I look around and see the superficiality of it all...the things that I let consume my thoughts, and the action's that I display. Is this what the Lord wants of me? Absolutely not...so then why do I continue to make Him reach deeper and deeper and destroy all that I have worked so hard for? All the friendships that I have made possible, and all the people that I have become close to....if He truly loves me, He would let me keep what is precious to me just for a little while longer.........but even I know that's a lie from the enemy. "IF"-- a word I've grown accustomed to in these recent months. I'm so stuck on what is superficial, and what will keep ME happy instead of what I should be doing for the Lord. This life that I call "my own" is the Lords, and He isn't about to sit back and let me make a mockery of His name after I have made a profession, and given my life to Him--so I say. But do my actions exhibit what I have spoken? Do they show that I truly have the Lord Jesus Christ living in my heart? No...and neither does my language. When people meet me, they most likely aren't able to tell me apart from an unbeliever, either because of my dirty mouth...or the things that I talk about--even the way that I present myself. The Lord is tearing everyone I care about away from me, because I have come back to this place in my life where I am putting my trust in other's before I am putting my trust in Him again. Just 2 months ago, I remember when I just let go, and my Father in heaven caught me with open arms.....and just took care of me. He showed me that He will be my friend...He will be my comfort...and I will always be precious to Him........I am special to my Dad, and He truly does love me.......I need to come back to Him, and forsake leaning on my own understanding, because I know it gets me nowhere fast....I love you, Father.
