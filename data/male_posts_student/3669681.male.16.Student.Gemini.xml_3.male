It allows you to stream your entire iTunes collection to your stereo system.  Also you can use it to expand your already existing wireless network or use it as a wireless bridge.  The coolest feature of the AirPort Express is its ability to connect a printer to your network via USB.  Now thats cool!  Hopefully i can get my hands on one to test soon.    -MacMan
