I don't quite understand the marketing logic behind such things, I mean really, is it supposed to feel good having a lovely smelling bit of paper covered in stinking human excrement. Perhaps it is to flush with the comfort that, when that little piece of you go's down the toilet, it will be in good smelling company, as such a comfort your poop could not go without.
