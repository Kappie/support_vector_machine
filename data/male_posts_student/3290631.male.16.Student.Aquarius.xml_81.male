Dan slept over last night and we woke up around 10 am to head over to the park near Yankee Stadium and play--which would be convenient since Steph and Rachel would be going to a game there around 1 pm with their camp and Dan and I haven't seen them in weeks.  Steph called us when we got there and we talked to them in front of the stadium for a few minutes before we got in.  I felt a little uncomfortable though since I didn't know any of those camp people.  But I hugged Rachel and that was awesome since I miss her so much.  Then Dan and I played soccer for so frickin long that by the time we were completely worn out, the camp was leaving the baseball game, so we got to talk to them for a few more minutes on their way out of the stadium.  I saw Rachel's main-squeeze, Goopen.  But I only saw him from behind...Then Dan and I bought some smoothie materials from the nearby supermarket and walked back to my house which was almost unbearable after playing non stop soccer for hours.  But we made it.  I was sooo dirty though so I showered when I got home.  Then we made smoothies and those shits were so ill.  A couple hours later around 7 pm or so, we just collapsed.  Dan is still asleep but I'm up doing this shit.  I'm done tho.  Peace.
