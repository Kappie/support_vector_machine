The detail of the graphics on my pc is quite impressive, plus the gameplay is something extremely fresh.   Helped my father to transport some stuff at the appartment today, pretty much all my movies and computer games are there now, only my computer and clothes needs to be moved. (as well as some random stuff i forgot)   After that i went to  Wanderley 's house and played  magics  a bit.  Caillo  came without being invited. (I hate that guy)When he left, we planned to play a bit of  D  but i had to leave.   Played a bit more Homeworld and listened to the  Shenmue  Soundtrack. Damn, if there is a game i'm going to miss playing on my  xbox , it certainly is Shenmue II!   English tests tomorrow hahahahaha!  Regards,  Zephyr
