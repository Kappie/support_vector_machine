But in a final effort to ruin my life it left a horrible throat behind. Not mine, someone else's. WHAT DID IT DO WITH MY THROAT????????   HELP ME.  Too much cousework. Too, too much.  I am sure that I will end up dying at 18 after having kamakaze bombed my school. The whole thing. That would be impressive ( its big ) (one nuke should do it - I won't get a second chanse after all )
