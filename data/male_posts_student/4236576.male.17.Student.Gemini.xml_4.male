Well I thought about it a bit. The answers came together right then. The reason she is treating me like dirt, is to give herself a reason to talk to her "best friend" Mike, who she likes. That would explain why she doesnt ever want to talk to me, wants to talk to him, and puts him over me. If she likes him, making me look bad would make herself feel better, thats why she has been accusing me of cheating on her. Soooo I called her, her line was busy, she was on the phone when she told me she was watching TV. I finally got through and she said she wasnt on the phone. I asked her if she likes him, she said no. I explained what I thought and then she admitted that she likes him. I asked if he treats her better than I treat her, she said yes. I guess she hasnt been paying much attention to what ive done for her. She said all the stuff ive done doesnt mean anything to her. She said i dont care about her and I'm not there for her to talk to. But in contradiction, I am there for her, I wasnt before and thats why lately ive been trying to be there for her, and when i try to be ther for her, shes too busy talking to him. I cant believe this. That is why she left me today, for a reason to see him. I knew he liked her, now i know that she likes him. She keeps rubbing it in my face that I liked my "best friend" way back last november or so. For some reason she feels that If i do something wrong, It makes it OK for her to do it to me. What ive done is wrong and I know that. I regret alot of the mistakes Ive made but now she is doing the same to me and I cant do anything about it. I cry myself asleep knowing that Ive been trying for nothing, trying to get to her, trying to show her who I am, and she has had her head so far up his butt, that she thinks I dont care! Yes money doesnt mean everything, but I do feel that drving 20 miles just to see her for 5 minutes, calling her while im at work just to tell her that I love her, making up silly little sayings, doing tiny little things to show that i care, do show that I care about her, but she has overrun all the things ive done to show that I care about her with these thoughts that I dont, just so she can run to him. I knew my suspicion of him wasnt just a hunch, I finally got played with my own game, after I changed my ways... I guess Im too late. I never do anything right.    Sometimes I feel so alone
