For those of you unfamilliar with the Canadian system of government, it is unique certainly, but not to complicated. Certainly not as complicated as that of our neighnours to the south. Man, I can't begin to understand how that works.  Life is busy for me at the moment. Working hard daily, fixing computers for friends in my evenings, and keeping very involved with my church. (Leading a musical worship team often, and ministering as a youth leader). Jenny and I find time for each other as much as possible, and I try and keep my social life balenced by hanging out with my roomates and friends as well.  Speaking of friends, I've come to some disturbing conclusions today whom I can count as such in the bunch of people I work with. For the second time in a row, I find myself purposefully not invited to a social gathering by the same young lady here at work. This young lady works in an affiliated department in my division, and as a division we are all relatively the same age and social standing. Thus we work as a division and play as a division. I have always gotten along well with this young lady (so I thought), yet for the 2nd time in the last couple of weeks (3rd in the last month or so) I find myself intentionally not part of the social activities she organizes. What a blow. I am certainly outgoing, and definately have the tendancy to be loud or even obnoxious at times, but I would like to say that in the end, I get along with everyone, and most certainly have no problems getting along with me. Still don't know the end result of all these feelings, but we shall see........  Oh the drama of it all, eh? *laugh*  Anyways, I will continue with the mediocrity of my existence for now, plot and scheme of how to obtain the finances I require for the next year in a short period of time, and try to continue to write about these things here. To any who decide to see this, peace and blessings.  Rooster
