Ya, so it's just an 8.5 hr shift but still, I'm not used to doing this kinda work. And it was on a monday, so we just got the grocery order in. There were 3 of us men and 1 girl doing the load. I separate the girl cuz she works on cash but got grocery hrs cuz 3 ppl went on vacation, shes not as fast as us tho, not cuz shes a girl, but cuz shes not used to the work we do... and cuz shes a girl :P. Anyways, in total we musta gotten 6-7 skids... wooo... by the end of the nite they were all gone!! I worked my @$$ off... whenever I'm working and a manager is in I just can't help but work extra hard. I also cut my finger on a box... yes u heard me, a box. That box was deadly! It was a lil more rigid than most, and as I bent down to put it on the ground, I let it slip down my hands. As it went down, the corner sliced open my right index finger. It was a pretty big cut. 2 days later and it still hasn't healed yet. Last nite I was still able to open it and see the red of my flesh, but now its sealed itself quite nicely. Anyways, work was boring...  When I got home I went on msn where I learned alot more about myself. It's true, when I think or do things I tend to exaggerate the effects or seriousness of it. But I still see this as a long term decision. And I'm still sure that if she was wit u then u wouldn't ever hurt her enough to chase her away. You don't seem to understand, that if Plan B happens them Ima be happy, as in "I wont try to steal her away" happy... as long as u do as u promised.  Well... I'm 17... possibly not even finished 25% of my life. Sometimes I wonder, am I growing up too fast? Should I have done what I did? If I go to Plan B... well I truly be able to go through with it the rest of my life? ... I'm sure that if I was to do B then she'd want me to break that promise... but still, that'll just show more of my fickleness and tell her that she can't trust anything that I said before or anything that I will say in the future. And what would people who I meet in the future think when I tell them that the I broke my promise to that last person I cared for? ... But no, I still have no regrets...  Tuesday: My only day off this week ^.^ ... and it rained... hahaha, just my luck eh? Well I ran some SC and WC3 before I finally left to get my haircut. It feels so nice to lose all that extra hair andit's so much easier to keep in check now. I was considering doing the bald fade but heeded my mom's warning and decided not to. But honestly... is my head really too small for my body??  After the haircut we went to my Grandma's where my rentz are tiling part of their basement. It's look pretty good... then me, my mom, and her mom went to this cheap chinese buffet right at the corner of Brimely and Eglington called China Buffet... original huh? The food was good in comparison to the price, and after dinner we returned wit food for the ppl who got left behind. There my uncle and I ran some dreamcast. LOL, he beat me twice in MvC2!!! Not that there's any excuse, but I felt bad for running the expert tactics so I kinda took it easy on him, but he deserved those vics anyways. Afterwards we ran soccer, he won, then NBA 2K2. He won the first game by 20+ but I got the cheapest, flukest win ever the 2nd. It was the final minute and I was down about 8. Like in the NBA, my team started to intentionally foul. But my uncle put it on arcade mode so there were no calls. I took the cheap baskets and brought it within 2. Wit about 10secs left he inbounded and I felt bad for the fouling so I started pulling my men away from the ball handler. Wit like 3 secs I left I went for it to make it look close, they fouled I got the loose ball and I jacked up the 3... it rimmed around for a sec and fell in at the buzzer. We laughed hysterically and gave each other daps. But I'm sure he knew as well as I did that it was the cheapest win ever. I didn't say anything but still... cheap. Finally we went home and after a shower I feel asleep rite away.  Weirdest thing happened tho. I almost never remember anything I dream about. But today I can remember exactly what happened. I was here at home, I think on front of my comp. For some reasonI did something to tell people that if they loved me they should come to my door. Someone came (don't worry not HER) and we looked at each other passionately in the eyes. Then I leaned forward and kissed her as I slowlywe slowlymovedtill her back was against the wall. We stood there kissing for a while before I finally led her outside my hall and we sat down on the flat part of the stairwell. I sat against the wall while she sat on right on front of me so that I could wrap my arms around her. I'm not sure how it came about, but eventually I told her something and that I had already promised my heart to someone else... just then I woke up. The odd thing is, I don't remember who the girl is. I know she's shorter than mecuz I recall leaning forward and down to kiss her... but I still dunno. Something tells me that she's from Mowat too... hmm... any dream interpreters out there?  On the bright side it's good to know that in my dreams I can still uphold my morals and values. ^.^  Thx for reading, Warren  [8/5/9] (these #s don't express how much I miss you all)
