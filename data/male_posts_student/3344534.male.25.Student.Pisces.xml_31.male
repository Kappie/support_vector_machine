I am writing a kernel module for Linux kernel 2.6. I am currently dynamically allocating memory in the kernel module using the "kmalloc" function call. I am basically DYNAMICALLY creating an array of structures in the kernel module. I then plan to fill this array of structures with data and export it to the user space. I tried using the "do_mmap" function to map the kernel virtual address to the user virtual address. However it fails i.e when I try accessing this memory region in the userspace I get a segmentation fault. Can someone please enlighten me about how do I map the memory area dynamically allocated in the kernel space to the user space. the person wrote to the linux community on orkut... i thought it was pretty cool... i still like how orkut gives people a more professional outlet instead of being only social like the other networks out there.   urlLink this  is pretty interesting.  i wonder if elected officials and powerbrokers in buffalo have read this.  we seriously just need to get our crap together and clean house.  there's still too many people who think we're in the 1960s and 1970s around here.  our city is dying... we have to find a way to keep young people here, otherwise we'll keep on going the way of hartford, ct. becoming a shell of a city.  i think it's quite interesting how marketing and branding has increased its scope to emcompass cities and places.  it's not just for toothpastes and products anymore.  you have to play towards the people you're trying to attract.  "They come here for the architecture, history and gritty atmosphere."  if you market that to the right people, they will come.  it's the same reason why there was a migration to the village, to the east village, to chelsea, and onto astoria/lic, williamsburg/greenpoint, and dumbo in nyc.  if you catch the attention of enough people to attract a critical mass, people will move and bring with them income which can revitalize neighborhoods.  of course, this happens in hyper-time in new york since there's already so many people in the region who are always looking for cheaper rents.  the markets can't adjust as quick so that smart (re)development takes place and in many cases it destroys the feel and character of some neighborhoods.  it can cause great distress for families that've been in a certain area for awhile.  rents can go up as landlords exploit their resources namely the housing stock, which at times leads to established families having to look for housing elsewhere.  in a sense this is and advantage for cities in the northeast and around the great lakes.  since there isn't quite the demand for space, if they have a good plan to implement for growth, and they have a progressive government, they can grow smartly and at a slower pace.  i think growth pace is important, you need to grow steadily and fast enough to attract people, but slow enough so you can resolve any problems before taking on some more.  it helps to have a master plan, a vision, so at least work can be done to achieve a certain goal.  this is something that is still being hammered out here, there's some semblence of heading in a direction, but there's still a little too much fragmentation in the grand scheme of things.  hopefully that'll continue.  secure your  urlLink networks !  especially you new yorkers!  i mean it's cool and all that you provide free access to your neighbors and all... but... it's probably more trouble than it's worth to keep your network open.  spend a couple minutes reading the manual and enable wep or better yet wep and mac address ip matching.  last but not least...  urlLink tc  sent this to me.  a  urlLink post  on craigslist that was funny.  i don't think i'd go out of my way and complain about gettin some from someone normal... it's hard enough finding someone normal uhhh... normally?  i guess if you are looking to find weirdos through an alternative route though...... =].  ja... das ist alles.
