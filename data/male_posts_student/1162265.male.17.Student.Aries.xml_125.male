So I went and started my AP history assignment, outlined the first of four chapters, and browsed all the DBQ documents.    I feel slightly better knowing work is over, but somehow something about it, that I can't put my finger on.  Really, really bothers me about it ending.  Like I forgot something?  I don't know....
