Summer school could be a lot worse. I'm getting a 91% in the class. You make think "hey not bad". BUT ITS EFFEN HEALTH.  Oh well, we watch at least one movie a day, and I only have 14 days of class left. It blows, because I'm always tired afterwards, and I feel like I've wasted my day -.-   Anyway... POST!  -reb
