I arrived about 6:30 and dinner was almost ready.  Sheila made German crepes.  Then we all went outside on the deck and chatted.  It was nice up there; sunny and just right temperature wise.  Grandma is getting old (88) and has damencia or Alzheimer's.  Her memory is strong in some respects and very weak and fragile in others.  It's very sad to sit and experience this.  We all went back inside when the sun went behind the trees and chatted some more.  Grandma went to bed and didn't even say goodnight.  I know she was excited to see me and warn out.  She knows I love her and that's fine.  She was exhausted.  I spent some time talking with my Uncle Steve one-on-one, which was very nice.  I came home and went on-line.  I'm still behind on English 101, but hopefully will get caught up soon.  This is stressing me out and I need to get it off my shoulders.  I also need to get my appeal finished and sent to the judge for that stupid lying cop in Ellensburg.  Damn homophobe or agist cop.  I had never been pulled over before and he lied by adding 10 miles per hour to what I said I was going.  I took my Pride stickers off my car after that.  Officer wouldn't even let me see the gun when I requested it twice.  This was back on March 25th, coming from hockey in Spokane.  I'll keep you informed how the appeal goes (as long as I get it sent in time and I'm not behind bars).  I'm off to bed, been a long day since I got up and read when I could have waited.  I'll finish it tomorrow between Operating Systems and English.  That's all for now!
