So, if you're like me, and you only have one of the seven NBC channel's broadcasting the games, then you have to watch the crap they want you to watch and miss out on any of the potentially cool events.  For example.  Today, they spent a freaking hour of coverage on Synchronized Diving.  Synchronized diving?  What the hell is that crap?  Not only should it not even be an Olympic sport, but the USA team didn't even qualify!  Why waste an hour of coverage on that?  Ugh!  I want to see Fencing, or Judo, or other cool stuff that you don't get to see all the time.  Instead I'll be stuck watching Michael Phelps, or two chinese girls jumping off a diving board at the same time, or even worse...basketball.  Yes, let's give Olympic basketball all kinds of coverage, it's not like we EVER have the chance to watch basketball any other time.  Back to my original point, at least if all the networks got to cover the games, then we could at least *choose* the games we wanted to watch.  Let one of them networks bid for priority or something and they can show all the finals or have first choice on what they cover.  Then let the other networks cover the other stuff that everyone else wants to see.   Okay, enough of that.
