Took some pics with my new digital camera.  Oh, oh oh, my left arm hurts a lot.  I benched a lot during weightlifting and now I can't fully extend it.  And that was on Friday.  What else, what else.... I think I need to ask this chick out who I know.  She's cute and nerdy.  She plays video games and has a good sense of humor.  And no, Alex, she's not fat.  I think I have a good chance with her.... but if I get turned down for a date, then things'll be really awkward around her.  Cold is gone, woohoo.  I need to get together with my old friends.  Maybe make some funny movies.  I'm out, I need to ding 17 in EQ and then 18.  Or maybe I'll play some CS with "Rame Duckaru".  Maybe I should finish ID2.  Oh, fuck, I stopped watching the superbowl at 8 minutes left in the 4th.  Go Tampa Bay!  Or Tampa... yeah, it should be just Tampa, Tampa is the city.  Not like they need any cheering on... it was freaking 34/3 for a while, but then it was 34/15 last time I checked.  Ok, bye.
