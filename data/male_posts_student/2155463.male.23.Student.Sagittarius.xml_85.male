Of course, I've still got a lot of today left to go :-P  I actually went to Spanish class this morning.  I feel kinda bad about it, but of the 8 Spanish classes we've had so far, I've only actually gone to 6 of them (an incredibly low percentage for myself).  But it's just so hard to get going sometimes; I really don't have any motivation to go (aside from the obvious fact that I have to pass the class to graduate), and it just seems to drag on so badly when I'm there.  So anyway, I called off the public defender's today and tried to work on Spanish homework / studying all day.  Needless to say, I was only partially successful (inasmuch as I still have about 4 hours of studying and homework to do tonight and it's already 10 pm).  So that's been frustrating.  We had the second week of playoffs for our volleyball team tonight.  Considering that our team ended up in 6th place out of 7 teams, we weren't even supposed to make it into the second round, but here we were.  And we actually were playing a team that we knew we could beat, so I (and most of the people on our team) were feeling pretty good about things.  But I don't know if we were all tense or what, but it just wasn't a very good night - we got beat in straight games, and I have to admit that I really didn't have my best night (and neither did anyone else for that matter).  Oh well, I suppose there's always next year.  And I got this strangely sentimental note with my fortune cookie tonight (Chicken Kung Pao from Pearl...yummmmm).  It said, "Someone from your past has returned to steal your heart."  Of course, I never put any faith in these kind of things (sometimes they're downright laughable (even if they are right sometimes)...like the one I got in DC that said, "Politically, you're an independent"), but sometimes they really can get you thinking about things.  And this one definitely got me thinking; it totally surprised me how quickly I knew who I wished that person was.  And then it surprised me how quickly I put the thought out of my mind, and how dejected I felt about it.  Anyway, I suppose that this is just a normal part of life...but it still sucks. :(
