By the time I get home Chichi is gunna be gone to NJ I won't even be able to tell her "bye" in person. It's gunna be just wrong without her, but I'll still have Sonya, LinZ, Kiki, and megan ( me gf) that doesn't talk to me that much anymore. I dunno why but it akes me mad because I wanna talk to her and kiki told me she is home, but if she is home why doesn't she get online so we can talk? But anyway nothing exciting is happ'nin' 'round these part. Oh I almost forget I'll still be able to talk chichi male counterpart, Erich. but hey Chichi never forget us  we love you and you will be missed don't forget that. and never let anybody get you down remember that you always have and always will be a very very ausie chick * as you would say but I'll say "gal"*                                                 ttyl all you homewrecker jkjk I'd never say that bout ya'll
