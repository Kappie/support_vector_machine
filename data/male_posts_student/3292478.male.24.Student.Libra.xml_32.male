Considering that she is a  Primary School Teacher  (teaching 5 year olds) the test was actually quite accurate. Maybe thats an indicator for what's in store for me!!                     Extroverted (E) 63.16% Introverted (I) 36.84%  Realistic (S) 64.52% Imaginative (N) 35.48%  Emotional (F) 54.05% Intellectual (T) 45.95%  Organized (J) 61.11% Easygoing (P) 38.89%
