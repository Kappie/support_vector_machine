Much better.  Its the last day of school tomorrow - so I thought it might be a good idea to start this Blog now so I catch the whole of the summer. I don't know why...But its the beginning of one school year and the end of another.  When I say school...I mean 6th form college at my old school...But its my current one...You know what I mean right? Well anyhoo I'm studying my A levels, hard work and not much spare time.  "you stole ma story...Well?" hehe the interesting beginning to the film.  getting back on track... Yeah A levels....We join the school again as, pretty much, senior members of the place, we're the oldest and make up the prefects too. Great! One would think...  yet NO! We get treated like immature juveniles who cannot even be trusted to come on site when we have lessons - instead we have to come on site even if we have no lessons in the morning and stay there until we have lessons - great example today - came into college at 8.45am - and I had no lessons till 2.45! I mean what a waste of time - I spent it playing table football or 8-ball pool...fucking rules of this place really suck.  to top it off there's a stupid rule about attendance. If your not in, on the nail, at 8.45am then your not in school. No exceptions. This bloody rule is catching everyone. If your not in on time then you get a phone call or a letter home to check if where you are. the form tutors arnt even nice enough to bend the rules and tick you in...miserable bastards.
