And then I thought she ruined her chance of me trusting her, cuz she implied that laura wrote "Thea is a sexy beast" in it, when evidently it was Angie... Mofo.  or maybe Mary lied, but I think I trust her enough.  I wrote another poem a few days ago, If i had my journal with me I'd post it.  Maybe later.
