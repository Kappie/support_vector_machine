"The true threat is whether or not one of these people decide, peak of anger, try to hold us hostage, ourselves; the Israelis, for example, whom we'll defend, offer our defenses; the South Koreans."                                    --George W. Bush, Washington DC, March 30, 2001  This quote forced me to ask a burning question:  What the fuck??????    I thought long and hard about this statement, through many a day and night.  It cost me many sleepless nights and troubled days.  Using advanced psychological therom and after many attempts to decypher the words from a scramble, I have come to the conclusion of this cryptic statement.  George Bush  is  Yoda from Star Wars.  Listen to both of them......and you'll see.    Go America........Puppets are people, too...........
