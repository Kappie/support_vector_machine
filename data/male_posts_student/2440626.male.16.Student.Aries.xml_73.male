It started yesterday and it isn't supposed to stop raining until Friday. That is a lot of rain.   So you know that commercial for some cell phone with the band singing on the phone? Well it turns out that song is a really good song.  I am going to Kel's house tonite. Another  Summerfest.  A movie perhaps? Hopefully blindman's hide 'n seek. That is always fun.   Well the FayCo Fair (short for Fayette County Fair, for those of you not in the know) starts this Thursday. Kel and I are working the Old Trails Lions Club booth on Friday morning. Come out and we'll serve you breakfast.   Well, I think I just came up with something else to do. I am gonna go wash my hair cause I just had a haircut, and I a bit itchy.   To all those who read this   Have a good day.
