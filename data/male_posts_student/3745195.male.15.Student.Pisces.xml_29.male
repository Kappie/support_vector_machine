The things about eva were just because we went without talking for two years and I was just scared of her not talking to me again, but I shouldn't have said those things I did and for that I'm sorry. The thing with kendyl I think I explained pretty clearly. I did want to get to know her [and if i found that I liked her it might have gone somewhere] but i never got to know her well enough, but somebody i did get to know better was you, and I started to like you. When I asked you out it surprised me too, but I knew it was the right thing to do... and I know your the right one for me. If you decide we should just be friends I will support your decision and try to be the best friend ever, but you must know:  "Nothing is ever really lost, or can be"   and this holds true for my love towards you. That love can't be lost and I will cherish all the times we've had before and the times to come [wether we're more than friends or not.] I might have told you this already, but I guess I could share it with you once more. The moment I met you [the day samie introduced me to you] I knew at that moment that I would fall for you somehow, I just didn't know it would be this strong of a feeling. I have been doing a lot of thinking while you were gone and I have come to the conclusion that I want to be with you the rest of my life... whatever direction our relationship takes us, wether we decide to take things to another level or just remain friends, even if it means that we just think about each other and call each other from time to time, I want to be with you. And I just want you to know that you will forever be in my mind.  I will always love you Kyle/Ky/Keelay [whichever you prefer] I can be anything you want
