The host eats the other eye. In this way the knots of brotherhood are tied. It is an experience one does not quickly forget." I suppose this is not unlike other ritualist dinners of brotherhood in all kinds of places in the third world. I have really found a facination with this area of the world. It's amazing, all the history of the world that isn't told to us here in america, even about our own country. I love history, I love stories of the past, I pray we will learn from our mistakes on the level of humanity and on personal levels as well.  I am extremly wired on coffee this morning. I'm on my second pot and my eyes appear to prepnderate from out of my skull. I have two articles I need to start writing. Deadlines are coming soon.  Yesterday, on a whim, I signed up for the raptor handling class and made it out there around 11am. We spend about three hours going over all the ways to handle the resident raptors(hawks, falcons, and owls) and ways to read the birds behavior. In the last hour of the class we had to oppurtunity to handle some of the birds. I worked with a Dark morphed red tail hawk named cocomo and a little screech owl named blinken. Both birds we very well behaved for the session, I enjoyed the entire event.  When I got home, I recieved a call from an employer of a start up banking company. They do the banking at the local casinos and Cal card rooms. Weird, but it is 20 bucks and hour, so if it works out, i might be sitting at a blackjack table for a living, without gambling. I will probably be the only person making money at the table. Now I have to sit tight and wait for a call back to set up an interview. I hope he calls back, I am sort of weird about the whole posistion, but if I can sale jewelry, whatever. I fucked up and smoked some pot so I need to get that out of my system in case I have to take a piss test. It was just a few rips so hopefully it will clean out quickly. I was pretty worried about that most of the afternoon, not to stoked on losing a $20/hr job over a piss test. dammit.  Sometimes we choose the path not all that thought out.   current mood:  worried current music: Cave in - stained silver
