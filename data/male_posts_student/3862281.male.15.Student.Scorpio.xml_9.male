Why am I worried about the school holidays? I hate being alone. Rarely do I ever leave my house (usually I only do so to go to school or to buy necessary things like clothes and food). I prefer to stay at home and play video games non-stop, call me a fool but that would be a matter of opinion and if that is your opinion I must say that you are the fool for being so closed minded about your thoughts.  These holidays will be my first without Alyssa as she died after the last holidays I had and therefore the only company I'll have is my ignorant father and any of my 'friends' who actually think I like them. There is no-one left on Earth that I know in real life that I can truthfully say I like. There're people I know over the internet that I like however yet I only like them because they seem to like me, and they only like me because I'm able to make up my own life to tell them, the only people who know the real me over the internet are the people reading this (if anybody).  And so the holidays are already upon me and I must face 5 weeks by myself with only virtual reality to entertain me, the hardest part is remembering why I carry on and why I shouldn't end it now, I could never let that happen, I promised Alyssa I wouldn't.
