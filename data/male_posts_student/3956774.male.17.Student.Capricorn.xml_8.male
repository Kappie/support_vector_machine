Leyles and myself have decided we are going to get stringer more involved ion the goings on in Littlehamptoin so we are going to invite him out more and more! huzzaa. Anyway it has reached my attention after browsing through lauren, stirngers and helens blogs, how sad, that there is a brawl in action. Naturally i wish to get myself involved and spread infamy and bewitchment to all unfortunate enough to read my ramblings. Thus having decreed my services i feel it fair to join stringers side since helen join the ranks of Lauren. stringer i pledge my alleigience to you until such time as i feel it necesary to exchange it for a plastic goblet. That my friends ends my poinless ramblinhgs for another day. i bid u fairwell for i wish to have a bath, whereupon on my exit i shall smell bewitchingly of addidas shower gel. Hurrah. Nachos.
