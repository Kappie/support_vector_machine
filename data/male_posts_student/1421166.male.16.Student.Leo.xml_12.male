Oh, didn't post here last night, cause I was just busy doing my last minute revision for Geography CA today. hehe. But nothing much yesterday also. Just that I ended up trying to install the Lord of the Rings computer game my Dad bought. Then just kept watching TV. So, didn't study much also. But at least I did my QT! It's nice and refreshing. Pray that the train will start rolling after this. I just hope I didn't do it, only because I wanted peace for my test. But I got peace anyway. Then today was it. The time had come. After all the revision on the bus and during other lessons, I think the paper was quite ok. Except, I didn't quite know how a tropical storm is formed. But I hope I'll still do well la. And I failed my A Math Class test!!!! 14/30!!! But guess it was ok, cause many people did badly. After all, it's only tenm percent of the total score. Well, today just during the last period, I was having serious gastric pains. Argh...so painful. Then I rushed down to the canteen for a sandwich and some Indian Rojak. Only then, I felt better. Just as I was enjoying my food, I suddenly realised that I was late for my Chinese oral!!! Ah!!! Like Clark Kent(exaggerated...duh), I zoomed to the study area outside the staff room. Phew...I was just in time. Then of course, I was nervous la, and couldn't speak properly. But it always happen la, so stay happy!!! =) hehe. Then went for practice la...practiced Merry Widow. Actually, it's a very easy but nice pieced. Didn't want to practice Salute to Abba la...don't like it. So after that, went home with Yizhong. Talk about X-men la...so crap...but it's quite cool la (not the conversation, the X-men.) Then I was home, just sat around imagining some silly stuff. Leting my imagination run wild(not in a bad way) ,  and then decided to catch another episode of Smallville on my computer. haiz...so sad for Clark, just can't be with Lana. But somethings have to wait la...but the whole story very sad la. Ok...gotta go.I've been doing some thinking recently, but it all comes back to the quote: The right thing at the wrong time is the wrong thing.
