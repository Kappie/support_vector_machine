Penny, Gerry, Morgonne, Heather, and Nick came too. Its was one of the best birthdays I've had! We swam in the pool. Even though the water was freezing cold we all had lots of fun. Gene shivered a lot, so for once it wasn't me shivering :p So I got to make fun of him for that :p I liked hanging out with my friends and having lots of fun. I wish we could do it more often :s Ohh well. School is starting September 1st. I can't wait! I'm excited about my classes and that its my last year in high school, but I think I'm most excited about being able to see certain people everyday :) Well thats all I wanted to say :p
