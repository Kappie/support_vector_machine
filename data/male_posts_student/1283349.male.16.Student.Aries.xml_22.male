Why does tiredness take over the recesses of the mind and tell you to do things such as "Go eat cake while hanging upside down on your roof!" or, for our future psycopaths out there, "Kill, maim, destroy, eat cake, kill, maim, destroy, pretty flowers, kill, maim..etc..." Yeah...well, since I have the sense as to NOT do either of those things...I will entertain you with small things that come from my big mind...or at least some witty person at the t-shirt/bumper sticker/funky saying place came up with.   If you choked a Smurf, what color would he turn?  I have gotten many answers to this question that hurts many, many minds along the way. Purple, red, green, rainbow, flesh coloured...you know..the usual. But what if...Smurfs really aren't blue? I mean, what if they are like the Blueman group thing and PAINT on their azul tinting? Ah, the world never ceases to wonder...   If a liar said he was a liar, would he be lying?  This question has bothered me for ages. Some people say that perhaps he had a moment of truth. I say that the guy has a personality disorder or something because if a liar said he was a liar then he would be telling the truth but in turn would be a lie which would make it the truth.....it's one of those circular things...you know.  Welp, since my eyes tire of looking at a computer screen, I will go stare cluelessly at some Algebra homework...Okay, fine, not cluelessly, seeing as I kick ass in graphing and stuff, but you know...it was a good thing to say at the time.  Maybe my flying monkeys will come visit me tonight. It'd be a nice thing. They bring presents. One time, I got this pair of house shoes...no..wait....that was my aunt that gave me those...Ah well. She looks like a monkey anyway...  Goooood Bye! Adios, muchachas! Arevoi, and I know that spelled that wrong and stuff...ah well. Good bye, in the many languages of the world.  I (heart) you all!  Mistress of all thingies rubbery and that go boom, Manders
