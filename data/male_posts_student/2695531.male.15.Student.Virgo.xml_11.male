Anyways, I've decided to start back up this blog after some serious reconstruction and deleting. I hope to create a journal as well as a page for my own editorials on current events, politics, philosophy, etc. I will also try to include links to some interesting and/or important must-see web sites. Thanks for visiting and come back soon to check my progress!
