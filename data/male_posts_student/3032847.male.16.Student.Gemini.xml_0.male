Most places (like argos) dont take people on 'till september because they aren't busy enough during summer.. and you have to be 18 to work in blockbuster, 17 to work in GAME, etc. Popped in the JobCentre, and what utter pants. If everyone relied on that place 15 year ago, no wonder unemployment was 2 in 3 in places :-O  So today we returned, armed with CVs and our filled in application forms for Currys (dixons). I also handed a CV into The Link, Leonards Electricals, Staples UK, The Hartlepool Mail, Focus DIY, got an application form for Vue Cinemas (don't think I'll give that back, though), but before all this I handed in a HELL OF A LOT of money in to the bank- in coins- which i carried to the post office who wouldn't have it, first.. and got a Scarlet Band bus to Stes with it (IN AN ALDI BAG!). Thank god it didn't tear and spill Â£135.50 worth of 10p and 5p coins all over.   Scarlet band busses? Yeah, same here- wot the fuck! It was pretty  knackered for a bus, and you didn't even get a real bus ticket. That was the only 'Scarlet Band' bus on the whole timetable- for the whole week. The bloke was canny like. And he had the Stranglers on the radio. First british bus I've been on that had a radio :-O although I'm not sure that- whatever it was, began life as a bus... (or something with an engine)!  Been over the road all night. Some mad Scottsman they know turned up. What a nutter. Canny like, and he had a van full of trials bikes :-D My mates got a job down the un-locally local, and apparantly the boss is some cock from down south- so 7 staff are leaving. Me mate reckons I could walk down there in the morning, and have a job by tomorrow. I mite just give that a try... and see what all these jobs I've put in for, offer, too! (If any reply)!
