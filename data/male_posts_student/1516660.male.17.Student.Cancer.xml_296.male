I went to write my Transfiguration essay, which is to write a story about Metamorphmagus. I didn't plan to do it de, but this morning in the bath, a great story idea came into my head. I thought "Why not?" and then wrote a story. I think it is a well-written story. What grade would I get? O? HaHa. Meow moo.  Okay okay. Later, I am going to go to MAA with WQ! WEEE!! How meowful! I am so looking forward towards MAA! I'll come back with my experience there, so wait for me, okay? Meow moo meow!! (My fingers are flying all over the keyboard now...cannot slow slow type).   Update. Okay. Don't have to type so fast anymore. That idiotic WQ is waiting for his lunch to be cooked. Why didn't he use his brain and ask his grandmother to cook EARLIER? He said he was online. What a twit!   Meow meow meow!! Okay. I go liao la. See ya!! Bye bye! Oh yes, Happy Valentine's Day!
