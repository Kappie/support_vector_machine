I guess i never really understood what you meant when you said i devalued your emotion. i think i had to experiance it to understand it. the person who has been "miffing" me makes it sound like my concern is of no importance.  he makes it sound like its ok for him to ignore me because my form of attention seeking doesnt work on him any more. he makes me feel like my art is worse than jess like my thoughts arent as good as evan's like im not as good as luke.   further he has made me so incredibly self critical, everystatement i make, everything i write, every though i think gets analysed - was that an attempt for attention? what aproch for attention was that? why do i need attention? why do i need confirmation of my ideas opinions and thoughts?   even now...  1 up mushroom: drama IP its done, i like it  poison mushroom: i wonder.....
