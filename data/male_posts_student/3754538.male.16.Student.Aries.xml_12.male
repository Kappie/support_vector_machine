If it isn't cold it will melt the ice cream too fast and end up giving you a room temperature, nasty-flavored, funny-colored root beer mess (it will not be cooled by the ice cream as i thought it would). You want the best of both ice cream and root beer but you don't want them blended. It tastes gross.   BTW: I am still pissed at costco for no longer stocking frostie; the best (and cheapest) root beer ever. I know Josh is with me on this one.
