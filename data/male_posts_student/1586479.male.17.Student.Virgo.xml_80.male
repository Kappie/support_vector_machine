So, it's 2:40 AM June 2nd, and the Bebop Fest is faltering. JD fell asleep and Mike and Brian are now playing HALO. Not bad. I would go to sleep, but I'm too wired on the caffeine from countless cokes I have ingested in anticipation of not sleeping at all. And now I'm sleepless with a stomach ache. A wise plan... or not. Anyway, the reason for this Bebop Fest which is failing is that school is over. OVER! Last exam today, and I owned it... I think. But it doesn't matter. It is summer and I am now a senior, se√±ior! And now I feel.  ...spaced. space-ed.  We are the newage digital ninjas. We run circles around you with digits and beats and you wonder where you fell of the gravy train. (heh...gravy?) Like ninjas... on fire. (a lollipop to whoever can recognize that reference)  How can speech be so cool?  It's like a geek who can't type... wait, I am a geek who can't type. Heh, well then.  AHHHH Cockroach! leave it be. It just wants the crumbs.  you can probably tell its early.  So would you relive this year if you had the chance? I sure as hell would. Without a second thought. I would've fixed all that went wrong. And a LOT went wrong. But I learned a lot too. Not from school, but through important stuff: life lessons, social interaction, self-awareness/preservation/reservation/meditation/rejuvenation.  And my computers ribbiting at me.
