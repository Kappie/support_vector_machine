That would be kind of a nifty thing to be able to do, but whatever, having that happen randomly would actually be a bad thing. eh, drunking ballplaying of some sort should be happening pretty soon. that'll be iLL provided we don't all die of heat stroke.   southern cross  never, ever bike across town in the daytime ever again! biking at night, however, is quite another story. here's to vandalism and hijinks on the streetz late at night... with spray paint!
