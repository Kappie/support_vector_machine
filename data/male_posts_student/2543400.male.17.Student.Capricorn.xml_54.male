Fuck I guess he's friggin different and I'm still the same old shitty me. I so need to start truely gaining weight and going to the gym or something. Damn! ;-  Well I keep doing push ups and sit ups at random times through out the day. And specifically before I sleep. For example, last night I did 55 push ups and 105 sit ups before sleep. Not much of an accomplishment for others but it's a damn big acheivement for me. :) After all i'm just a fat person who has flabby arms, ok maybe not fat :-) but i'm so friggin out of shape i'd probaly pass out if I ran 10 yards. :-)  Well gonna meet Andrew on Sat or Sun. For the rest of the week my goal is to gain at least 2 pounds and to keep doing push ups and sit ups, along with meditation. :) Shit my mind is so full of thoughts if I close my eyes all I see is an endless film running in my mind without a stop. Try concentrating on your breath when that's going through your mind. It makes you want pop corn. Haha!  Mmm.....popcorn.....
