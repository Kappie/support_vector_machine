In Clerks the main characters, Dante and Randall, have a discussion about weither or not the contractors on the Second Death Star were innocent civilians who were just doing their jobs.    Taking a lot of notes from Randall's initial point of view, here is my take on it. The production of the Second Death Star was stepped up to combat the increaseing Rebel threat, so much so that it would have far exceeded the Imperial Military's ability to construct the weapon in synch with their own scheduale. Independent, civialian contractors would have to hav been brought in to finish the project. These contractors didnt nessacarily know what they were working on, considering the size and scope of the project. Most likely the mojority of these workers only saw their peice of the puzzel, never the entire project. They could not be held responsible for the Empire.    A point of conflict is the moral one. They were working for the Empire so they must be evil. Lets say you are a independent contractor and the United States government offers you a huge government contract to build barracks in the middle of Arizona. You accept because theres a shitload of money involved and it seems like a simple and innocent enough project. Your on the job one day and a bunch of left-wing militants blow the fuck out of the place. Your wife is now a widow and your kids starve. If the Alliance, and latter its non-militarized version in the New Republic, stand for civilian rights and the freedom of trade and choice they say to, then these families deserve reperations for the economical and mental stress that was dealt to them during wartime.      Thank you for listening to the rambleings of a Nerd on something that has absolutely no real world applications.
