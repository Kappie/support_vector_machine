To paraphrase, Mondays are just like the first day back from break where you get eased back into the normal routine.  Almost all of Tyke's Mondays involve the students doing some easy little crap or busy work or something.  Basically, Mondays are pretty relaxing days.  Which has been very pleasant.  And man was today great.  An absolutely awesome start to the week.  Tyke woke up a few minutes before his alarm and he was startled by the brightness outside reflected by his curtains.  So he thought it was late and then looked at his alarm and it said 6:17 and that panicked him a little.  Then he realized, oh my alarm doesn't go off til 6:20.  So he closed his eyes and seemingly 20 seconds later his alarm went off and he got up.  He put on some clothes that he thought would be nice for the day but he was wrong.  Upon coming upstairs and finding out the weather he realized that he was gonna be overdressed.  That's too bad cuz it was just beautiful out.  But it wasn't too hot.  3rd period was quite pleasant today.  The DECA decathletes (just made it up) were all gone and that was quite a fat load of the populace.  Dotti was gone as she is a decathlete which sucked but Tyke did get to have a footrest in front of him by using the empty chair.  So even though she wasn't in class, she was still indirectly giving him pleasure (and not the naughty kind ;p).  4th period was entertaining in that Tyke, Amed, and Dr. Phil (although not Amed) tried to blow their gum up in the air and catch it back in their mouth.  Tyke failed the first try but the next two times he owned that gum.  Just flat out chewed it up.  Lunch was awesome.  Went down to Pie but they ate outside in the cloudless sunny sky.  Just awesome weather.  Splendiferous.  After school Tyke gave Purdy some advice on getting rid of headaches and then he tried to scrounge up some people for some bball.  Amed, Skippy, and Piggy J all agreed to it.  Karla and Maniak both initially said they would/might but they were unable to attend.  But they still had even numbers so that was good.  Tyke won 21 and then his team won each game to 11.  It was fun.  Tyke has not been finishing that well around the hoop on easy shots.  He still hits most of the harder layups but not good enough.  He needs to improve finishing.  Cuz he can rebound and drive pretty well outdoors so he just needs to work on getting a higher percentage of shots to fall.  And Tyke could hardly hit anything but his fadeaway jumper today.  He really isn't that good of an outside shooter though so that is expected.  He is streaky.  One of the best things about today's bball was that Piggy J brought an old school boom box and they played Pink Floyd the whole time.  Loud.  With little kids all around.  And parents.  One guy even commented that he wanted the music turned up.  Yeah, Pink Floyd rox.  So does Led Zepplein.  And the 4 Tops.  Haha, physics was funny.  There is just so much good music that is old but really deserves to be listened to.  Tyke is pleased to know that others share his view.  Kudos to all who think like Tyke.  Screw wanting to be like Tyke.  "I wanna be like Tyke!"  That sounds like a good way to finish this blog.  Even though there is more that could be said.  Keep on Tyke-liking!
