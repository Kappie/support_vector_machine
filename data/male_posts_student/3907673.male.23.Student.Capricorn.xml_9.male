Today learnt quite alot from my senior, they taught me hw to to cashiering job and had to remember lots of codes, hope that i can cope.  But one thing gd abt today is that only got 1 class today which is POC, which started early as food knowledge teacher is still not back. then today mr theow covered all the theory leasons from stock till meat deboning, and also thaught hw to cook lamb by braising.. tomolo would be our turn to cook.. hehe  Hope that i would no cock up tomolo practical. Then today also got the working timing for carrefour liao, only put me work 4 days.. tomolo going to tell him to put me more, cause need lots of money.. hehe  Hei think that's all for nw, till then  Cheers Thomas
