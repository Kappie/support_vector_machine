Okay fine.....I can sort of see that school is supposed to teach you stuff that you can learn later on, but I learn practically nothing in the majority of my classes. For instance, who didn't already know that volcanoes spew out lava, which is pretty much the extent of what Ms. Bertrand teaches us. That class is soooooooo boring. And what about math class; they claim that they level the classes, but it is really just split into the stupid kids, adn everyone else. Why not just have an actual class with actual smart kids who actually know stuff. Mrs. Mikels has to give me these stupid worksheets so that "I am challenged in class."  Sorry about my ranting but I would just like to point out the fact that  I HAVE LEARNED PRACTICALLY NOTHING IN MANY OF MY CLASSES AND IT'S BORING AS HECK .    p.s. how come we are the only class who hasn't even gotten to the point in Root's where his leg gets cut off. We never really watch it anymore.
