Did some research and stuff for the project we are working on and these strange people came in with Mr. Gledhill.  French was quite good today actually.  I think Mrs. Bladon's a bit obsessed with mind maps, we've done a lot now, heh!  I still have some work I need to do over the holidays... damn!  Break time came, and no cameras were in sight.  I had a wicked sandwich for lunch today.  It was stuffed with cheese and onion and salad bits and pieces.  English was up next where we did some more cool work on the Carol Ann Duffy poems, which I have to say, not being a great poem lover myself, are excellent (plus they're also cool due to the fact they have swearing in them and naughty words; Mrs. Auduoin Swore! Hehehe)  Maths was good.  We're back doing Number again which I'm really good at.  I can't believe that a few months ago I really hated and found Maths difficult whereas now I'm flying through it.  Now then, dinnertime!  Cameras lined the canteen, their big black lenses gawping at everyone whilst they ate.  It was quite surreal.  It was as if these strange beings from another planet with square black bodies were observing daily human life.  So strange...  Chris was brave enough to enter the canteen, and 'get a cup of water' from the cooler, mouthing "Hutton Report" to the camera each time he passed one.    We then went to the bench area to escape the scary visitors in the canteen.  We had a laugh around the vender.  Becky sold some of Chris' drawings to daft Year 7s for small sums of money lmao!  The orders were flying in.  Chris bought a mini bag of Fizzy Haribo from the vending machine which sells a little (bloody miniscule) for 50p!  What a ripoff!  You can go to Tescos and buy a big bit of actual fruit for cheaper than that... Sheesh!  Minutes later the scary camera crew turned up again and started filming grime on the walls in J Block!  I have a small feeling this report or whatever they're doing ins't going to be something great.  Period 5 was so boring, and Biology passed in what seemed seconds.  Me, me bros and Dad are going to Stoke on Bank Holiday Monday to see Harry Potter 3!  Can't wait for Half Term to start.  8 more weeks left of school, god this year has gone quick, and to think that after the Summer holidays I will be in YEAR 11!!  Last year of school!  But that's if I'm still here ;)  Had a cool chat on MSN with a friend who has been receiving some petty abuse from bloke-woman.  You know who I'm talking about Becx ;o)
