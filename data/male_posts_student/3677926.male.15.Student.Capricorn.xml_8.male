You want to lead a normal life once again and wish you were never famous. Yeah, we have the luxury to dream the dream but not the misery to walk the walk. On the bright side, sport personalities like Kobe Bryant and David Beckham get megabucks by wearing Nike’s and Adidas’. We have to pay a few hundred ringgit to wear those sneakers yet those guys get paid 6 to 7 figures to wear them but I would definitely not like to be a Fredrik Ljungberg who has to appear on every signboard in  Europe only wearing a CK underwear. On the down side, what happens when you make a tiny mistake both on and of the field? The consequences aren’t the same for a normal sports athlete and a sports megastar. If a Darren Fletcher were to receive a red card in a football match, it will only fill the bottom left-hand corner of a newspaper but if David Beckham were to receive a red card, that incident will be on the front, back and middle page on every newspaper in England. Not only that, he will get boo-ed by every away team fan in the country for several months. Of the field, when Kobe Bryant was accused of rapping an American teenaged girl, that story was on ESPN, CNN and even Entertainment Tonight. A rape case on Entertainment Tonight! Unbelievable!! If and when a sports personality makes a mistake, he will automatically become a villain. This is when the saying really goes “From Hero to Zero”.  Not only that, sport personalities are often picked-on. Normally females will wait for famous sport players to pick them up by a bar and a few days later, those girls will accuse those stars of rape. How convenient. Sleep with a guy and accuse him of rape later on. The truth is those sluts are looking for mega-bucks and fame are willing to sell their bodies to achieve that goal and those stars are foolish and naive for falling into the traps set up by the sluts. Famous examples of these cases are the gang rape by a few English Premier League players and the Kobe Bryant case. Another disadvantage is that sport stars have no privacy. Every move made by them will be scrutinized. Every transfer rumor and action will be reported. Every girl they go out with will become instantly famous. Every comment they make will be under the microscope and misinterpreted. They won’t be able to go out on a family vacation or do the groceries in peace. They will be followed, disturbed and maybe even spat-on by a fan of a rival club.   The truth is that most sport personalities want to be able to lead a normal life (just ask Roy Keane among others) like you and me and yet most of us don’t seem to appreciate the advantages of being normal. Just appreciate the things you have and you will be able to life happily ever-after. (Ya right, as if we will be happy without the millions….sniff) Thank you for reading this article and please give me your feedback on this article and my other articles.
