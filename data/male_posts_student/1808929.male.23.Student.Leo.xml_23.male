Tomorrow I have to return to med school mode so tonight is my last smell of freedom.   Today has been a big day of changes. My folks and I moved a 6-foot tall bookshelf into my apartment. I also cleaned out my dirty refrigerator and moved all my plants outside to my patio. I have quite a few large plants that have been in my room for most of winter, but not anymore. The biggest change was that I finally shaved. The great facial hair experiment of 2004 has concluded. It seems that most people don't like it, especially women. And even more so, I think that most of those who said it looked nice were just trying to be nice to me. After having shaved I barely recognized my own face. My chin seemed so small.  Anyway, it's gone now.  My parents, Papa, and I were on our way to the Golden Corral (Papa's favorite restaurant) yesterday when Papa asked me about the kinds of sports I like to play. I told him that I like running, volleyball, tennis, basketball and such. Papa, out of nowhere, starts laughing. He begins to tell a joke about something that Grandma Monie said probably about 70 years ago. See there were these two little girls arguing about what game to play. They went on and on until Grandma Monie told them to hush up and suggested that they both play "dog". Confused, the girls asked how you play "dog." Grandma replied "you come sniff my butt and I'll growl." Yeah, it's not exactly a joke; it's more rediculous than anything else, but it was funny as hell to Papa. After a few seconds his laughter became contagious and we all couldn't help but let out a quick giggle.
