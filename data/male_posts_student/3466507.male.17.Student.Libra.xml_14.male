Well, as expected, got a blasting from my mum about the maths and chem marks. I didn't expect to get an A in physics either...  She threatened to take away all my activities. It's always like this, every time my grades go down(which is like, every other time), she always threatens to take away my activities, which she does. Guess what happened? I didn't even get to go out with friends. It's just study, watch tv, study.... great way to get good friends, eh? Now you know why I didn't have many good friends in secondary school(otherwise known as highschool).  There is no encouragement when I do bad, no "Just try harder and score better next time". All the encouraging words I ever get is, "Keep it up, we're happy with you", but when I get low marks, do I get any encouragement? No... Just scream and yell at me and take away my activities. That's ok, I'm just an emotionlesss robot anyway, aren't I? I don't have any emotions, and just exist in this world to get good grades and study, to hell with other activities. "I don't care how you do it, just get 3 A's at the end of this year", these were her exact words. Oh, so she wants me to study all day long and don't do other things? I can do that. See you in the nuthouse then. Or does she prefer me to cheat in the exam, get disqualified and thrown out?  I know this is for my good but this has gone too far. It's always like this. I know they'll have plenty other things to say, how they've encouraged me each time, whatever, that it didn't work and whatever....  They always have the last word -period.
