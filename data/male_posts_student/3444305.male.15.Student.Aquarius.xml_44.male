Last week, I'm gonna try to remember it, but I don't know if I will be able too. It was two weeks ago so yeeeaahh. But I finished summer school last week. That was a nice accomplishment. No more APS which is always a nice plus. I turned in my term paper and everything. In the last week we really had nothing to do, he would always let us out early and we would just watch movies. We watched this comedic documentary called "Journey's with George." It was about George Bush and his presscore. It was actually really good and funny. It made me look at George Bush in a better light too, which is a hard thing to do, but I guess he isn't that bad of a man. He just sucks as president. But yeah, on Friday, we just went in there, and people turned in their term papers and we watched our final project videos. Me and Ryn, or Ryn and I for you english people,made ours in light of John Kerry oviously. We had George Bush endorse John Kerry, it was pretty good. We made him eat ketchup since John Kerry's wife is the billioniarheir of the Heinz company. And then we worked "as normal people" for our second commerical. But after we played all our videos it was only like 8:30, so he just let us go that early. So, I was relieved to be done with summer school, but I had to go home and make sure all my stuff was packed because I was leaving for Chicago at 10:00. So I get all my stuff ready and then me and my whole family, because my sisters both came home to go, went up to Chicago. It took about three hours to get there, but it didn't seem that long in the car, and when we first got there, we had the task of finding our hotel. It was crazy, and my family is very disfunctional, but we finally got to the Embassy Suites we were staying at in the Loop. Once we got there, we decided to go on a walk, and we went around the Loop and went to Michigan Avenue and went to stores that like no one can afford to shop there, or at least we can't lol. But, we just walked around and went to Water Tower Place and stuff like that. It was fun. Then we came back to the hotel and got free drinks because that's what the hotel gives you I guess. The adults got free alcohol, and us minors got Sprite with Grindeen in it. But, my dad and my mom and my sister tried some alcoholic drinks, and I got to try some of theres, and let me tell you, I would rather have Sprite with thecherry crap in it, over the alcohol any day. I don't see why people love to drink so much, it's so nasty tasteing. Oh well, I'll figure it out when I'm 21 I guess. But then we just went around again, in chicago its crazy which is always fun. And we did the same on Saturday, but on Saturday, we decided we were gonna be cool and ride the L. So we went on the L and rode that to the end, and then rode it back, just because we are cool like that. And then, I went and bought a smoothie at this really cool Health Grocery Store/Cafe which was really good and really really cheap. I even got a free energy boast in it. For dinner on Saturday, we went to this really really cool restaruant named Benehanas. It's a Japenese restaurant where you have your own personal chef and they make it right in front of you and they do all those tricks with their knives and stuff. It was really cool. I got terriaki steak which was really good, also very expensive. It was very good though and a very good expereince. On Sunday we took another walk and did many other things in chicago, and then we packed up and left the hotel for Shamberg because we wanted to go to that cool IKEA store. So we figured out how to get there and we went there. It's this huge, and I mean huge, blue and yellow store. It has three floors of just tons of stuff for your house. They had esloclators for your carts. It was the coolest store ever. I got a cinumum roll there, which was only one buck and it was really good and big. We stayed there for awhile, and then we drove all the way home. When I got home, I had to unpack, and then wash all my clothes, and then repack for camp. And then I went up to Walmart and saw Jenna and she told me she was trying to get ahold of me and that she could give me a ride to camp. Then I came home and then went over to get Amanda, and then we walked to go see Kyle because he had just finished his sergery on his leg. So we stayed there for awhile and visited him, and then I walked Amanda home, because I had to be home by 8:00 because I still hadn't packed for camp. On the way home, I called and asked if I could go see KLT and Haley since I was leaving and they said yes so I went and saw them. And I walked with them for a little. And then I stayed at KLT's for a little and then I ran home and packed for camp. Then I woke up and made sure all my stuff was packed and then waited for Jenna to come pick me up. And then I went off to camp. I'm going to write about camp in another post then this. It will be after this one because this one is too long to begin with. If I missed anything in last week I'm sorry. I know I missed alot, but I can't remember lol. It's just gone from my memory, I've been to busy to write too. So these things keep getting longer and longer don't they. I probably hung out with Kyle and Amanda and KLT and Haley alot. Oh yeah! And when I got home I had my summer school grades which was an A. But he didn't like my term paper or my final project or anything big I did. He was never like specific though on them, he was just like "write a term paper on this prompt." We'll I did write a term paper on the prompt, so why'd I get a B on it? Oh well, I got an A in the class, and I also got Mr. Blair for my spanish teacher, so I'm happy about that. Well I'm gonna go upstairs and give my cousin a call. I'll write about camp soon. See-ya.
