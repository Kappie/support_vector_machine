I don't know what my problem was Friday night, maybe all the stress finally got to me.  I just went to bed and woke up fine.  I told my friend from class, the female, that I'm gay.  She is thrilled and instantly in Heaven and my newest fag hag.  We talked for a long time she is now trying to fix me up with her sister's friend from school.  Will keep you posted on that one.  I went to Becky and Donna's wedding reception last night.  I had fun spent a lot of time with the few people I knew there.  I drank a lot of free Bud Light and was more than slightly tipsy by the end of the night.  Joe made a toast that everyone was talking about the rest of the night, "Remember, marriage is not just a word, it's also a sentence."  We flirted with the str8 bartender that we thought was gay.  One of the other workers there was gay, but I didn't pick up on it 'til the end of the night.  I gave him my number and we'll see if he calls.  After the reception some of us went up to Sam's, a bar a block away.  We hung out there and I flirted with a table of three guys.  They were fun, friendly, and good company.  I wish I had courage to talk to guys like that when I'm not under liquid courage.  *sigh*.  Everyone was worried about me driving home so I went to a friend's house close by and spent the night there.  I got up at 8:30 with a slight headache and headed home.  I wanted to be in MY bed and resting on MY pillow.    I just rested my head no more than three minutes with my roommate Dale opend the blinds in the living room and walked by my door and said goodmorning.  He added, "Want breakfast if I make it?"  I said, "Sure."  Before I knew it breakfast was ready and I had maybe five minutes sleep.  Headache went away quickly.  I didn't drink water before bed last night, that's what gave me the slight headache.  I was going to go up to Mount Vernon today, but decided tomorrow after school would be better.  I'm going up in the evening and having dinner with my Uncle, Aunt, and Grandma.  I just realized as I typed that there is a PFLAG meeting tomorrow night in Everett and I'm going to miss it. *sigh*  Oh well...They aren't usually THAT exciting that I'll live if I don't go.  I have a lot of English homework left to do; I'll be working on that today and this week.
