It looks like there's some guy trying to take on  urlLink Fox News  with a new movie called " Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism ". The  Associated Press  ran a  urlLink story  about it and it appeared in numerous papers and web sites ( urlLink Fox News  included) across the country. Along with the story about " urlLink Outfoxed " they also ran a  urlLink rebuttal .  This is going to get interesting. It should be noted that " urlLink Outfoxed 's" major sponsor just so happens to be the anti-Bush group,  urlLink MoveOn.org . I'm not sure exactly what is going on here, but it seems that we have a lot of upset liberals angry at the fact that there is someone in the media world that refuses to be like them. Most other media channels (*cough*  urlLink CNN  *cough*) have such a liberal slant that it's hard to tell what exactly is going on.   They're either upset that  urlLink Fox News  is going against the grain or that because they are more conservative than the other sources (remember, they are the fair ones) they are not really as fair or as balanced as they claim. I haven't seen any pro-Bush ads on  urlLink Fox News . I've seen plenty of  urlLink MoveOn.org 's ads on  urlLink CNN , though. Which news channel being biased again?
