Why the hell are some books on 1 Day Reserve... I'm being screwd over on some readings...  I'm getting out of town in 1 Day!!!  Now playing: Bad Religion - "Generator"  So I saw  All About Eve . It's a good movie. I want to look up some of the quotes that the character Bill Sampson makes about the nature of celebrity.   I'm hungry  **
