I won't go into it, but it was fun; Conner, Mary Kate and I 'discussing' things with Brian. Yes. Discussing. And we determined liberals are always attractive people.  Only three more classes to thanksgiving break! Yeah!  \\--->internal error 546; memory error *zap* Tim: "GAHHHHH!!! I'm on fire!!!!!!!!!!! The burning!!!!!!!" *zap* Tim: "gurgle..."  Yeah, I recently discovered I'm not who I think I am. I went on a long journey to find myself, or so I thought, but it turns out I was just at Carribou Coffee down the street. Who would of thunk it? I had a nice long discussion with myself. I found out I am actually a b-type, despite what I thought I was before.  I am too tired and unable to think to post about anything important, so I'm going to go draw now. I want to make political cartoons. I have good ideas. But I forgot them.  Also, to all my friends:  You are all beautiful people.   as he fades into the backdrop of the universe......adieu
