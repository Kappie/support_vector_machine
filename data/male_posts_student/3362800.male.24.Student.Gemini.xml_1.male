The event started at 730 am.However,for us who woke up at 530am and waiting for the bus to MRT station, we were frustrated.We WASTED an hour just to wait for the bus!!!  Without any choices,we called a cab to go to Kallang,the place that the event was being held.It's really shocking when i saw the amount of people walking and squeezing around. The doors, the paths are too small for the amount of people.It's really uncomfort to squeeze with people and i HATE it..Somebody started to climb over the fences and of course,this dangerous act cause someone injured.I am not sure whether the gal's face did scratch or not but I really pity of her.  The event last for few hours,and someone went back home with the Nissan Sunny 1.6.Not me...haiz..Today really not my day,I wake up early but can't get the bus.When i went home after the event, I realized that my bunch of keys was lost!!Stress, and frustrated are the feeling I went thru today.  Ha...Finally,the weekend is over.I really scared of being too free.When i was free,I keep thinking of somebody,my loved one.But,I can't get her because her hp was lost.This make me even frustrated.Anyway,better day will come.Hoped so..
