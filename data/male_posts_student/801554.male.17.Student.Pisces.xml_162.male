       
      One of those wierd days.  I'm very very apathetic about vacation and I don't have a clue why. I don't like school that much, and now I'll have much more time to hang out with cool people, but, eh.  I guess I do like my school. Yay Boylan High. And now I'm a senior.   Taking it as it comes.
