Then today we spent the whole day lazin about just chilling and cuddling (we spend a lot of time cuddling coz i love it) and now I'm waitin for a super late bus so i can stay at the love of my life's house for just a little bit longer. I really love him, it's bizarre coz I've been hurt in the past and am usually a bit cautious about relationships but this time I've totally fallen and couldn't be happier. If you don't know Matthew then let me tell you this, he's so amazing in every way, he's so sweet and doesn't even know it, and really loving and a big ol softy at heart, and he has the most amazing bright blue eyes and a smile that brightens up his face and makes him look even more beautiful,plus he makes me so happyand the best thing is HE'S ALL MINE! Woo for me!! I'm missing Matt now (he's sitting over there with my guitar) so I'm off to cuddle :D Love you loads Matthew, Amanda
