It isn't your intention to get into a political, religious or otherwise controversial conversation, but for some reason, you seem to draw people to you who are interested in doing that very thing. The strange thing is, once you take some time to digest their point of view, you find yourself agreeing with it despite the fact that it's the opposite of how you used to feel. You may not change your mind wholeheartedly, but there is definitely room for compromise.   The "stars" really don't know me at all, do they?
