I'm sure it was nowhere near as amazing as Miss  urlLink Laurel 's [ urlLink blog ] was, for she went to a showing of   urlLink Garden State   (damn you!)--but it was fabulous nonetheless.  urlLink Zara  [ urlLink blog ] and I journeyed over to the magnanimous  urlLink Vickie 's [ urlLink myspace ] house yesterday afternoon for some swimmin'. I wasn't planning on going in the pool, as I couldn't swim, but I was assaulted and forced into the pool by the girls. So into the pool I went and off my body my shirt went (did I seriously just type that?) to the delight of Miss Zarandaria (don't pretend you didn't love it, Zara). I eventually taught myself how to swim and then proceeded to kick Zara's ass in a race across the pool, even though she hella tried to cheat. Cheating gets you nowhere, Little Missy.           urlLink Andrew  [ urlLink myspace ] and his punk-ass little brother arrived later, along with a couple other random kids, which was my cue to get out of the pool so that I would be out of the way while Zara and Andrew got a little more intimate (which never happened, 'cause they're both hosers).          But enough about those crackers. Once out of the pool, I ate some chips and chatted with Vickie's stunningly beautiful little sister,  urlLink Theresa  (I hope I'm spelling that correctly). I'm afraid I am in love. I'm still unwilling to belive that she's only twelve years old--perhaps everyone is just playing a complex trick on me. But, seventh-grader or not, I'm in love with her, and I  will  conquer her. I'm pretty sure she's at least halfway in love with me anyway.          Ha!  urlLink Mary  called me twice last night trying to get hold of me, but guess who didn't answer 'cause he was having so much fun? (Me, you retards) Now who wants to talk to  who , bitch?          [shameless plug in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...]       For another, more feminine telling of last night's events, go  urlLink here !         In other news, I watched the unrated version of  Eurotrip  last night, which was suprisingly funny considering it was written by some creepy middle-aged perverts. It had everything an R-rated teen movie should feature: boobs galore, shitty soundtrack, fat people, that creepy Russian guy that's in every single movie in the world. And they threw in a load of flapping European penises for good measure. Oh, and the bitch from  Harriet the Spy  was in it--all grown up and ravishing.            urlLink G-D : OH, YEAH, LIKE IT MATTERS THAT SHE'S ALL GROWN UP. YOU PEDOFILE.              You spelled pedophile wrong, dumbass.            G-D: {SMITES -chuck-}                     -chuck-      ...or eat limes...
