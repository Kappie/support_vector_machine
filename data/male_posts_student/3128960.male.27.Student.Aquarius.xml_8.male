An alltheweb  urlLink search  turned up a variety uses for the term "blingo". For instance:   According to the "help-a-teacher"  urlLink web site , Blingo is a computerized and slightly modified Bingo. The "twist" is that instead of getting numbers called out, your teacher calls out alternate forms of numbers, i.e. fraction and decimal equivalents. This is not a cool game. It's a math game. It's not gangsta. Little Timmy excelling at fraction conversion does no justice to my epiphany.   Alternatively, I thought an  urlLink UrbanDictionary search  might prove more fruitful. Again, no dice; but there are some definitions worth noting.   One Alan Lowney explains the term as a combination of "Bling" and "Lingo." So "Blingo" refers to "phat, wicked, or 'street-credible'" speech. Renaming Bingo to Blingo would undoubtedly grant it street-cred, but I'm not sure I would use the term as anything but the proper name of a game. If, for example, some kid came up to me and used the term as Lowney suggests, saying something like "That sounds hype yo, he got alllll dat blingo" (Lowney's own example), I would be forced to drop kick his ass with the  urlLink Quickness .   Dee-Devil suggests that "Blingo" actually refers to a person who is "a combination between a gringo and a pimp, that in this case would be a 'bling-blinger.'" Dee-Devil's example of using this term in a conversation is as follows, "Dat blingo sold me his best bitch fo a bag of twinkes." Now, I hope that your initial reaction to Dee-Devil's definition of Blingo was one of utter contemptuousness. Mine was. And I was happy to discover I wasn't alone. The follow-up definition of "Blingo," courtesy of  Virus, is as follows:  "Dee-Devil, you make it obvious that u are one of the whitest white boys ever. If I knew where you lived, I would slap you silly. You are a lifeless dickhead."  I must admit, I would gladly mount up with Virus in order to regulate.   The point of all this is simple--"Blingo" is best reserved for lacing Bingo with a bit of street-cred. I mean really, if you won a pot of, say, 20$ and bought your girl a few bags of Twinkies, how tight would it be to say "It's cool Sherry, you don't have to get me back. It's a gift. No, no, pretty pretty, don't thank me...thank BLINGO."   For your entertainment, I present to you the rest of Dee-Devil's urban slang, quoted in full to preserve spelling and grammar:   urlLink Dilbert : "Anything representing utter stupidity or hate towards utter stupidity."   urlLink Pisscat : "An over terratorial woman, age 23-45 who looks and acts like a very angry cat. Ex:  My pisscat bandteacher shed on me  "  Now do you feel contempt?
