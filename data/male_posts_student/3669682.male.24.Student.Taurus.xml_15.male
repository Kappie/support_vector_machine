Consider this - Mrs. Lozeau (Daughter of  urlLink LÃ©o Laurent Lozeau , founder) is still at the helm, with her husband. She actually came down and met us (all 7 of us in training) and spoke with us, being all nice and friendly, and said that  she hoped we had fun there . And she really meant it, too. She asked each of us where we worked before, and when I said "C.A. Barbier Photo, in Lachine" she instantly said "Oh, with Mr. Giroux! Then you must know Francis (he's the guy who worked there after I left) - he's at the Camera counter..." She actually remembered, 2 days later, when she introduced our bunch to her husband, and said "this is Eric, he used to work at Barbier with Giroux." And her husband answered "Oh, Pierre! How is he, I haven't seen him in a while! Surely you know Francis! He worked there, too."    I've never seen more hands-on management, from up-high. And it looks like it works, too. You can clearly see that they care, that they show up every single day and walk around on the floor, and actually  help you out when there's a lineup .  Even better - we have specifically been instructed to  take our time with customers . If one guy talks to you for 2 hours about his cat pictures, and wants to know how he could perhaps make them better, or even if he just wants to talk about his cat,  take the God Damned Two Hours it takes . The customer'll be happy. We have been officially  promised  by the Photofinish Manager that he will never, ever ask us to "move it" or "clear the customer, we've got a line-up". Ever. And if another customer bitches that he waited in line for an hour while we were explaining things to another customer, we have been told to say that "if you ever need to have us spend two hours with you to make sure your order is correct and you're happy, we'll take all the time we need, and then some". And that's  official Lozeau policy .    It also feels nice to work in the largest photo store in Canada. You see, everywhere I used to work, anytime we didn't do some  thing  we'd just go and say "Oh, we don't do this, go to Lozeau". Well, guess what - I'm gonna have to get used to saying  yes  quite a bit.    And being the largest means also that I'll be handling  only  the photofinish counter. That's right, we're going to be  eight  behind the mother fucking counter, taking films and handing people their pictures. All day, non-stop. I swear to God, there's always a line-up. Sometimes, it stretches to the entrance of the store. And it's a big store.    I'm also getting cost+10% (same old, same old) on pretty much all products in the store - including  urlLink my next baby . Oh yeah.    It's nice to work some place I actually  like  again.
