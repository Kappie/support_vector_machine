As "graduate" students ;) although we do not get a chance to play much during the regular  semesters, we make it a point to play during the summer. And yesterday turned out to be a fabulous day of badminton for us.  Me and my doubles partner/friend, Sachin, lost the first game to Vivek and Ninad pretty easily (15-5 I guess). We seemed down  and out in the first one, mostly because of a lot of unforced errors on our part, and we tend to fire late. :) The second  game though, was vastly in contrast to the first one. With deft touches, deceptive drop shots and some hard kills, we sent  our opponents packing with a score of 15-6 in our favour. Important, Sachin and I got our hand-eye co-ordination going really  well. You need really fast reflexes and a strong wrist action to play badminton and although this sounds "technical matter",  its true. I love playing doubles, as a team, it sort of fires me up. I hate to lose when it comes to playing a sport, and I  use this to motivate myself, even if these are friendly games where nothing is at stake. Now this might sound funny, the fact  that games like these needing "motivation" in the first place! :) But when it comes to some things which I really know I am  fairly good at, I make it a point to go down fighting, and badminton is one such instance. It actually hurts me when I lose,  and those who have played with me, know that I get very vocal, nothing to worry about, but just venting my anger. :)  I used to be a doubles partner with my roommate and friend Rohit last summer, but this time around, I've got Sachin as my  partner, and fortunately for both of us, we seem to be clicking well together. Its important to adapt to a certain style of  play in doubles, either each player controls one side of the court (left/right style), OR one player controls the net game  (more about defence) and the other plays the role of the more attacking player right from the word go, from the back of the  court (offense). Sachin and I play the defence-offense game and for both of us it comes naturally, from whatever experience  we have had before. However, I must say we are still playing using the old badminton laws. According to recently made new  laws, the match consists of best-of 5 games, with players needing 7 points and not 15 to win each game, true for both men's  and women's matches. This law, I guess, was changed so as to make each game last for a shorter time, (and perhaps faster),  and thereby increase the public's interest in the game.  The third game between us turned out a humdinger. :) There were a lot of ups and downs for both teams. We initially had the  balance tilted in our favour, with a 5 point lead. But Vivek and Ninad played some good shots to level the points, and from  then on we just couldn't bounce back. We eventually lost by a whisker, as the game went into a 17-pointer (17-15). But the  game was special in terms of the huge amount of rallies we had and everybody gave it their best shot. We decided to play the  fourth and final game as an 11-pointer instead of 15. We had to pull this one off to make it a 2-2 out of 4 games; we were  trailing 1-2 after 3 games. Again, this was a tremendous game in terms of the rallying and the vast range of shots we managed  to play. Nobody was giving up. The score stood 10-8 in our favour and we just needed 1 point to close it. After that, took  place some really high quality shots from all of us. The most wonderful aspect about badminton, that is perhaps not present  in any other game, is that you have to earn points on your own service. You never gain a point (even if you "win" the point),  if your opponents are serving. The score read 10-8 for almost 5 to 6 service exchanges and somehow nobody could gain the  upper hand during that time. But finally, we got lucky, as Ninad netted a forehand. We were glad to make it a "2 games all"  contest, but more than winning, it was one of the finest and the most satisfying game of badminton we had in a long time.  Personally, I was happy with my fitness level, and an increased stamina in general (Hehe...I sound like a pro at the All  England Championship from the Padukone Academy!!). :) Same time last year, was different, badminton tired me out in one  single evening, the tiredness being probably related to diabetes. Things have changed this time. I could have even slugged it  out for another 4 games, if someone asked me to! (I keep talking about diabetes again and again, might be irritating!, but I  hope I can start my chronicle dispatches soon).   Badminton is one game that I not only enjoy playing a lot, but I consider myself pretty good at it! :) In fact I regret not  taking it seriously during my college days in Pune. I have been playing since the last 5 to 6 years. During my undergraduate  years at the Modern College, in Pune, we used to play in the WIE Complex owned by the college's Progressive Education  Society. A few years back, WIE was a famous sports complex in Pune, which hosted National Games' badminton matches. It still  is one of the premier places for badminton in the city, but I am not sure if it still hosts the big games. I was extremely  fortunate to have played on the wooden courts of WIE for 3 straight years, for free! (Yeah, at WIE that's important!!). :) I  haven't seen wooden courts like those at WIE anywhere else, although I am sure there should be quite a few sports complexes  in Pune by now, sporting even better standards.  We were a bunch of enthusiastic folks who never missed an opportunity to spend a couple of hours at WIE atleast 5 days a  week. At one point, we ate, slept and dreamt badminton, such was the craziness. Most of the folks in our group, including me,  learnt the game all by ourselves, in those three years, by practicing for long hours. Initially, we played simply for fun.  But it did not take much to realize that we were getting pretty competitive amongst ourselves, and soon were involved in  serious games, and not just to while away our evenings (and at times early mornings) at the courts. One reason for the  competitiveness was that most of us were good at racket games. I was myself a pretty decent Table Tennis player in  school,having played the inter-school matches for a year. Its a different story altogether, that I had really no impressive  records to prove that I was decent, but it was a strong self-belief :) I was a typical Indian kid during that time (perhaps  things have changed now for Indian kids taking up sports). Never took sports seriously, inspite of the fact that I might have  been able to make some money out of it, if not a career! :) I have seen many of my friends who were good at particular  sports, but academics always held the upper hand for us. Also, WIE hosted a lot of national badminton camps with top players  like Gopichand, Rajeev Bagga, Manjusha Pawangadkar etc. We learnt a few tricks in the trade watching them play some  breathtaking badminton. Modern College too had a large pool of really good players. I had managed to grab a spot in the  college team but never played in the inter-university games. My only decent achievement was a runner-up in the singles final  of the college matches and the winner in doubles. But these were fairly easy games, and it was nowhere near state or national  level badminton.   Anyways, I hope we have another smashing game of badminton today!  I get the feeling, my blog here sounds more like a sports correspondent writing about Pros on the tour or about player  profiles or the like. But I guess I just love to write, and that's what blogging is all about. :)
