I just don’t want millions to die over this, but I guess there can be no other outcome. Can our leaders summon the courage and will to make it happen? Do they see it as we do? Are we deceived? Is this situation really as we see it?   I don’t want to see us use atomic weapons, but I will back their use if it is necessary. We must be ready to own the consequences of this in a way similar to how we owned Japan after the war. We have abrogated responsibility in Iraq. It seems we are unwilling to boldly remake it as it should be. If we do anything to defeat NK, we should do everything to remake it. This was our problem in the 50’s, and we ran from it then. Now we face the high price of inaction.  I desire a good outcome to this, but all I see are terrible and more terrible futures. If the 90’s were a decade of irrational exuberance, then the 00’s are a decade of pessimism.
