OH TO BE IN HEAVEN.  jenna said "tro" in her prom prospectus and wow isnt that the hottest word ever.  definitely at least a word of the week.  Don't let drowning ruin your summer.  Paddle smart from the start.  I want to go to NYC and bask in my lonliness amidst a swell of humanity.   i dunno.   i am just exhausted...
