The results are compiled against each other to decide which is the best thing ever!  The current  top ten  is:  1) Sex! 2) A sense of humour 3) Love 4) The best thing you can imagine 5) Free money 6) Unlimited wealth 7) Charlie Brown Christmas 8) Romance 9) Natalie Portman 10) Built-in slide  Although I'm encouraged to see  urlLink Calvin  Hobbes  lurking at Number 14, and  urlLink Monty Python  The Holy Grail  creeping in at Number 17!  After only a few goes I was faced with such tricky choices as:   Iraq needs porn  or  A Kazoo   Doctor Strange  or  Model Railways   World Peace  or  Covetousness   Heidi Fleiss  or  Peter Gabriel   Cadbury's Creme Eggs  or  Action Figures   With such hard decisions to be made in today's society, I'm beginning to wonder if I should just remain a student!
