Oh well, I'll see you at school or at a movie night if we do get around to having one.  Did you all have a great time?  I'm really really sad about Jenn leaving... I'm gonna miss her.  I'm glad I got to see her in Florida though to say good bye.     Yeah, that V Space thing was kind of retarded.  I didn't understand any of it.  And when she was in the hospital and she was almost dead it looked like they brought her back to life with mustard!!!  It was just too weird for me.  Well, I guess I'll talk to you guys later.  luvluv    Brittany Lou
