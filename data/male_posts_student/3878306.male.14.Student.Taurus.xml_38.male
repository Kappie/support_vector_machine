Wanfi got a new computer and I’ve been copying all my CDs to Atrac 3 plus format to fit lots of songs in one MP3 CD. I ate two croissants with some orange passion fruit juice. (Yummy). The tourist wanted to go to the Bronx Zoo, which is a small walk from where we were. I got ready and talked to Terrah and her mom. Her mom is so different from her daughter. On Sunday she passed some man who was smoking a cigar. She went saying “BAD BAD BREATH, BAD BREATH, BAD BREATH” and the man wasn’t even that far ahead. He kept looking at the group. Helen told me that they were thinking that the man might throw them something or follow them. Well none of that happened… 	When we left the Bronx Zoo we came with seven and left with six. Josephine was upset and tried and took a shortcut. (Not really a shortcut but whatever) she got home later that day and we went to palisades mall. We didn’t buy much it was more for the tourist. I really like Steve  Barry’s I mean not as much as I like Aeropostale.
