I've been having a hard time lately dealing with these things, and it is only now that I could expose them.  First of all, as a shock to pretty much everyone that reads this, i'll be moving.  I haven't told my friends, my tag partner, or my kliq either.  My mother has decided to sell our house here, and move with her boyfriend to Avondale, Arizona.  If I seemed at all distant to any of you lately, I'm sorry.  I guess I was just trying to make it easier on you and me to do this.  I've had a million good times here in Old Forge, in PA in general, at ESU..  From crazy nights on the porch way back in the day, to infamous Sopp or Cella house Parties, from Cinco de Mayo to New Years Eve to 4th of July. It's been great. I know that you Jersey fucks will time and time again talk down on PA, but without PA I wouldnt have learned so many things and grown.  I have met many people here, great and not so great. I've made many friends, a few new "family" members and even less enemies. Both good and bad, my time in PA is never going to be forgotten. I had conversations with many people over time about how easy it would be for me to get up, and just leave everything..how nice it would be.  But now that i'm on the verge of doing so, it's harder than I expected.  There are so many things i'm being forced to walk away from. Ya never realize exactly how important things really are until they arent anymore.  I would love to stay in PA..dont get me wrong. But, where would i live? With my grandparents?  I made the decision to go because i think in alot of ways there are so many things here i need to escape, and even beyond those things, there are better economic opportunities for me in arizona for my 2 majors.  Basically with school i'm going to be taking a semester off to get settled in.  I dont know..i'm trying to write a descriptive post of everything that has been going through, but it's hard to cover everything and every emotion. I mean just take wrestling for example. I Finally got the title as assistant trainer..i love training kids,...but now..i have to walk away and leave that..and leave wrestling again. I have to walk away from all my friends both old and new at the zoo, i have to walk away from my friends at school..its almost like dying and being reborn again...to be honest with all of you..it scares the hell out of me..i dont know how i'm going to do it. I'm not sure i CAN start over like this but i know that i have to and in the end it will pay off.  "Miles away no you're never turning back and I just can't wait anymore Miles away nothing left of what we had just when I needed you most you were miles away  when times were tough and you were down and out who was there by your side but now you're gone and I'm so tired of being alone with only your promises  the loneliness just fades away thoughts of you just memories no cryin out for what you're missing time won't forget what you meant to me"-Winger    So i'm sorry to all of you i'm walking away from and out on.   I want to thank everyone for everything throughout my life here. I will talk to you all individually before I go..i have a month left, so that's plenty of time.  I guess now..do me a favor..and think of all the good times we've had together.  Thats what i've been doing for the last month of sleepless nights.  IM me..lets catch up..maybe relive some old times so i dont forget them. I just want to thank everyone for being in my life..dont be a stranger. And lastly Dont take this seriously, because this post is all complete 100% bullshit.  I've noticed alot of people were waiting for an update, so i HAD to post something.  Ontop of all of that..we all skim..we all miss important things when we read..maybe this taught you a lesson.  Lastly I hoped this post would make whoever read this give a thought to what it would be like without me.  I figured it would make for some good IM conversations.  Some of you probably will end up IMming me without reading this whole thing...so then i KNOW i'll get a good laugh when you IM me and tell me goodbye..hahahahah This whole thing was inspired in part by "the late" Andy Kauffman.  The man is truly a genius.  If you don't know who Andy is yet, rent "Man on the Moon" with Jim Carrey.   I'll make a real post sometime soon when i'm inspired enough.  Don't take life too seriously..you'll never get out alive :p
