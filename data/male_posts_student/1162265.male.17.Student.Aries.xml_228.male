Kwanzaa, isn't normally religious in nature, it's far more spiritual.  I was reading an article on belief.net, and it suggested something even greater.  It did mention how Kwanzaa held many socially uplifting beliefs, but at the same time, it promotes ancestor worship very subtlely.  I can't remember the exact words, but their is a point (in formal Kwanzaa precedings) where you pass around a "Unity Cup" (I forget all the proper terms), and you take a drink from it (usually symbolically) sort of like offering libaitions, you speak the name of someone who died, and everyone says "Harambe" (I forget the meaning).  It's a way to connect people back with their ancestors, and in a way maintain a fair amount of culture.    Why am I saying this of course?  Well the scariest teacher, Mrs. Cooper, is Yoruba (the religion).  It shares alot in common with Santeria (as most Caribbean Hispanics call it)/Voodoo/Obeah (Jamaica, and British West Indies)/Candomble (Brazil) what ever else you want to call it.  Well, Mrs. Cooper, at least I got the sense, has the sort of gaze of a Mambo (don't even try to keep up with me) that a typical person in Haiti is taught to avoid.  I swear, randomly in the hall, I looked at her, she looked at me, and seriously, her eyes have been burned into my mind.  It was the creepiest gaze, like it had power or something.  So all I can think about is Yoruba, or things related to African "traditional" religion.
