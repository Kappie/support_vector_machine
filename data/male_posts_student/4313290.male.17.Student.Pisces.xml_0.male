One of my conclusions is that i am more committed to my freinds than they are to me. ok, not including inviting me places, or getting me birthday presents, or hanging out with me, or letting me use your stuff. where is the excitement to see me? where were all ur calls this week? i called you. when i say i cant accompany you on ur trip, do you wish i could come, did you beg me to find a way to come. I beg you to play hockey, to simply stay out another hour longer, do i want you around more than you want me to be around?  so i had another good day at work. i get comments alot, people who notice things about me. things sometimes i know i do, things sometimes i dont know i do. i try to do the right thing all the time, i guess, not because i want people to see me doing it, because i want them to let me do more things, i want them to see i have mastered my responsibilities, so give me more. I have never been more passionate about something than i am for my job. i punched out at 845 tonight, then stayed and watched and helped the nurses in the ER do shit for two hours. I just want to see the stuff, i'm not impressing anyone, i just would rather learn about that stuff, the stuff i think i love, then like go otu and feel uncomfertable with confused friends, non individuals i sometimes think they are.  i migth sound like an asshole. i guess people who expect freindship from migth thik i'm an asshole based on what i'm saying. i just am tired of ten people grouping up, pretending to be friends, i know some people dont like others in our group. there are three people i dont like int he group, i'm honest, and i act upon my beliefs. it sort of puts me out though, if they all want to hang out. two of these people have fucking magical curse spells over two of my good friends, and i guess sometimes theyd rather hang together tahn with me. its fine, i dont complain (too much to people) but is it too much to ask for my best friends to bail out on all their other shit to come help me when i need them. Ur a fool to think i wouldnt drop every damn thing i'm holding to go see a freind in need, i friend who i care about and who cares for me.  so my friends want to hang out with the girls. thats cool, go ahead, i just cant do it anymore because i dont feel attached. i'd rather watch a movie with a new friend or play shooter games with someone i can relate too, or chill in a store with someone i have emotional history with, then hang out in a group of confused, flirty, addicted, like "can't live without friends," people who i dont really have alot in common with it seems. i mean, i went to the warped tour with a friend and he didnt get into the shit with me once, not even like to the band we both fucking love. Do you even love them?  things are becoming clear. theres hope for an individual.
