The first part (before the "/") is the english pronunciation, and the second (after the "/") is the real spelling (for words in different languages).   urlLink This  is a good site for finding some good words.   szhamma/llama - I'm not sure what it means, if anything, but evidently in argentinean "ll" is pronounced like a soft J.  In german, it would be spelled "schamma."  Szhamma is usually used as an exclamation, such as "Szhamma!" although it can also be used as a noun, i.e. "Don't be a szhamma."  pasae/passer - Also a french word, I have no clue what this one means either, but I do know it's an infinitive form verb.  Since I know it's a verb, I decided to use it as a verb, although, like szhamma, it means next to nothing.  By the way, in german, it'd be "paßee."  (dee) gesheershpoolmachina/(die) Geschirrspülmaschine - German for dishwasher.  Just altogether a cool word.  Just a side note, the umlauted "ü" is pronounced more like "eww" than "oo" but it's a subtle difference.  fishsticks - A word Erik Johnson used to say all the time, it's similar to "Shoot!" and can't be used for good things.  peaches  peachy - Peaches I use similarly to fishsticks, except with good things.  Peachy is a synonym to super or great.  mofo - I'm sure many of you know what this word is short for, and that it generally means a good friend, similar to "homey" although to me sometimes it means what it really is short for.  Kustom Fooder - A phrase we used a lot in ABS today, one of the wisefools came up with it.  I'm sure you can guess it means "Custom Footer"  wisefool - synonymous to sophmore, which does in fact mean wise fool in some language.  I use it as a noun for sophs as well as an insult to anyone who's not one.  hoser - an idiot.    Lunch was quite interesting today.  Angie and her "Jo-Jo Po-Ta-Toes" and that she "wants to beat Mr. Thompson with a polish sausage."  And then Logan decides to mix things up and asks Luke if he would make out with Mary; he said "I'd rather make out with a cow."  Well not to be outdone, Logan says "What's the difference?"  I didn't hear it originally but Luke was nice enough to tell me so when I told Mary what logan said I left him out of it.  And so then somehow we got to talking about Mary and how she's married to "Joseph..."  it was really a szhamma of a time.
