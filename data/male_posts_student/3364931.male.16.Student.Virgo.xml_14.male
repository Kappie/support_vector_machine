Gab's birthday party @ Sentosa is on Sunday...and i have not got her anything yet ! have to make arrangements with Joel and Belle to see if they are interested in sharing...hehe...I have a feeling that i'm gonna have a great time this sunday during the party...hope i will not be disappointed..most unlikely though.. Oh and the Community run is that day too...wow..after weeks of practice, i am finally running the 5KM run at East Coast...hope everyone comes prepared...and my foot dosent give me problems... have to wait and see...i think i have to try another method of writing into this blogie...oherwise i will get bored of writing in and stop altogether...hmmm....am thinking about it... yeah so that's about it for me...im not a enthusiastic writer...but a very lazy boy ! hahaha okay till next time (soon i hope).  PS: Have to go for the CHIJ Fest on Saturday at CHIJMES with Glenna...okay...noted. PS(2): My chinese O levels Listening is on Sat ! so fast !
