After all, it wouldn't be my better judgement unless I had some kind of inferior judgement, which I must use every once in a while. It's not a big deal, in any case. But small concessions have an unfortunate habit of uniting and turning into rather big shortcomings. So perhaps I should put down my short rebellion against reason and live peacefully within myself for a time. I am, of course, rambling about my starting this "blog" scant days before I embark on a two-week mission trip to Mexico. There's really no assurance that I will continue this thing after I get back, but you never know. By the way, the 'useless trash' I referred to in the description only really includes stupid daily routines and usual occurrences. This post would be in the 'ridiculous rambling' category, and is therefore valid and does not violate my no trash policy.
