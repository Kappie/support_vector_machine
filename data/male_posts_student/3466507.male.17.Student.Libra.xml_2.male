I can attribute it to my dad's side, my mum says that she never really liked classical music. She complains that we(my two sisters and I) have all our dad's traits, but not hers. Of course we do have hers, but it is our dad's that show out the most strongly. I wonder why.  Maksim actually isn't too bad. His piano playing skills are quite extraordinary to me. Well, he's much better than me anyway. I only know how to play three Grade 3 songs which I memorised.  A short note to those reading this blog : I am attempting to perfect my English using this blog so if you do see any mistakes, be it in spelling or gramar, do not hesitate to comment and tell me about it. Thanks you very much.
