Thursday saw me try to get a grip on my deepest and darkest fear at the Greyhorse, and upon my immediate arrival, hearing the initial "QUEER" chant, brought me back to what I know and love - ignoring Ewan. If there is such a staunch ravage fucker as him, I have, and probably will never find one. This all bought me into deep, inhumanely pleasurable fantasies of a cigarette facial dis-figuation of the young chap, and his petite manhood. Alas I managed to control my urges enough to amuse myself on the image of the refusal of entry of over half of the parasites, and to enjoy an old acquaintance - Rowan's extremely funky quartet of funk and rock to its maximum. I also have to say that if Law ever decides to return for good, then this would be a greatly appreciated thing - good luck with Rachael and life down under in Fiery Dorset, and I can only hope you appreciate this overly korny paraphrase. Jen was also good for being there, I had to close the whole book on that school, and well The book was well and truly singed as far as I'm concerned, and her being there helped no end, whether the whole ting was done indirectly or not, I've never before managed to make friends with these kind of non-gothic wonders, before, and actually realizing how funky they all are, since joining Esher. Hell I even managed a half decent conversation with Chris Hodgson for crying out loud.  Anyway, tonight I went to another rock show with Jen, Law and Dan this time, in Richmond to see a band with such an exceptionally gorgeous lead singer, one who even Jens eyes were firmly planted upon. She can really sing, and after seeing her and the band, If only in a few gigs of late, they will definitely go somewhere if they keep working hard and go the way they are at the moment.  Tomorrow I'm of to Camden to meet with Anna, and more importantly Jo, of which I'm spine razor tingling nervous over. I guess if I just keep it cool and not drink or take too much and just do what I also am extremely good at, which is keeping quiet around large crowds, and so therefore lowering the scientific chance that I will make a twat out of myself, all should be dandy. Ah well, It's quarter to 3 now so I have by all accounts been speaking to you at this time for far a far too considerable time compared to a normal person, So I bid you - adjeu. xBuBzx
