So I was searching and this is the list of a very few writers that voiced their opinions:  The pages are still blank, but there is a miraculous feeling of the words being there, written in invisible ink and clamoring to become visible.  ~Vladimir Nabakov (Awesome arse guy!) Writing is pretty crummy on the nerves. ~ Paul Theroux Writing is a socially acceptable form of schizophrenia.  ~E.L. Doctorow The wastebasket is a writer's best friend.  ~Isaac Bashevis Singer Writing is easy:  All you do is sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead.  ~Gene Fowler A synonym is a word you use when you can't spell the other one.  ~Baltasar Gracián There are men that will make you books, and turn them loose into the world, with as much dispatch as they would do a dish of fritters.  ~Miguel de Cervantes My language is the common prostitute that I turn into a virgin.  ~Karl Kraus What things there are to write, if one could only write them!  My mind is full of gleaming thought; gay moods and mysterious, moth-like meditations hover in my imagination, fanning their painted wings.  But always the rarest, those streaked with azure and the deepest crimson, flutter away beyond my reach.  ~Logan Pearsall Smith No author dislikes to be edited as much as he dislikes not to be published.  ~Russell Lynes One of the most feared expressions in modern times is "The computer is down." ~ Norman Augustine Manuscript: something submitted in haste and returned at leisure. ~ Oliver Herford I like to write when I feel spiteful; it's like having a good sneeze.~ D. H. Lawrence I always do the first line well, but have trouble doing the others. ~ Moliére The beautiful part of writing is that you don't have to get it right the first time, unlike, say, a brain surgeon. ~ Robert Cromier Writers are always selling somebody out. ~ Joan Didion I love being a writer. What I can't stand is the paperwork. ~ Peter De Vries If you can't annoy somebody with what you write, I think there's little point in writing. ~Kingsley Amis A story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end... but not necessarily in that order.  ~Jean Luc Godard The most beautiful things are those that madness prompts and reason writes.  ~André Gide, Journals, 1894 I do not like to write - I like to have written.  ~Gloria Steinem The best style is the style you don't notice.  ~Somerset Maugham I want to write books that unlock the traffic jam in everybody's head.  ~John Updike Loafing is the most productive part of a writer's life.  ~James Norman Hall Most editors are failed writers - but so are most writers.  ~T.S. Eliot Fill your paper with the breathings of your heart.  ~William Wordsworth    "Manic Depressive Mouse or The Bluebird Of Unhappiness"    My latest stupid rant against anti-depressants and other mental health stabilisers, taken from Saturday's Guardian. Drugs never did anything for me - I rarely took the many pills I was prescribed during my early teens, being too lazy, forgetful and suicidal - but I still get very annoyed at anyone who criticises these drugs without knowing anything about what it's like to need them or how much the risks and the side effects are really outweighed by the benefit for those they do help.  I also agree with Dave that the problem is that not enough is provided in the way of care to accompany the drugs prescribed. I would still be on pills today, but for the fact that I know it would mean having to see a psychiatrist every week again, talking about problems the doctor doesn't or won't understand unless they fit to a check box scheme. 'Can't leave the house? That's a tick for social phobia. Can't sit down for ten minutes at a time? There's your Attention Deficit Disorder. General malaise? That'll be the borderline personality at work...'  When I arrived at university I suffered the general sense of being suddenly set adrift that I think most people feel for the first few weeks. But it seemed worse than it was at the time, and given my history of manic depression I decided after either one or two weeks that I wanted to see a doctor. I was given an appointment the same day, and after fifteen minutes with the doctor I walked away with a prescription for a hefty dosage (certainly not the minimum she could have prescribed) of a new drug called Venlafaxine/Effexor. This is a strong drug, sometimes known to induce mania and not recommended in anything other than minimal doses for people who are potentially suicidal. Great - but this is what happens when people operate on checklists which their patients know better than they do.  For most people the problem works the other way - they're in genuine need of help, but too human to fit into the necessary checkbox. Some of them don't need drugs, or need drugs other than the ones they end up being prescribed - and this is often where some of the problems arise. Others end up suicidal but still unable to get the pills they need, forever consigned to 'borderline personality' (i.e. attention seeker) or some even less subtle category in the doctor's notes.  I'm not sure what could be done to change this, since doctors these days have to cover their backs far too much to give the really individual care many people need. But before we direct our attacks at the drugs which are keeping people alive, we need to look carefully at the mental health system which is not.
