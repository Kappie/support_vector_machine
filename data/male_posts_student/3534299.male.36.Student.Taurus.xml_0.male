Two months ago, the hard-to-catch sound in our bathroom turned out to be a water leak. The apartment complex's complex plumbers came and "plumbed" the bathtub out, with toilet seat sitting on drawing room's carpet, driving my Korean friend so indignant (We Koreans don't shit, know that?) that I had to say a few blunt things, and, well, my Korean friend seems to have defected to North Korea since. After one of the dirtiest, and darkest, also dorkiest, existence in my life history, our bathroom became whole again (after two days or so), but hot water refused to come. Cold baths everyday soon gave me cold.    One afternoon, I went to the leasing office, ostensibly to give them "a piece of my mind." The little fella, who is grey-haired and "tough" apartment manager, gave me the sweetest, the stinkiest, and the seldomest (I just coined it, Okay?) spanking (verbal only). I fought back with reason, reeling under the repeated stabs from his insolent tongue, but I have read Gandhi and Christ too closely to kick the knave. Then began a brazen display of autocracy. All kinds of crazy and "spent-up" people walking into our house and putting ears to bathroom wall and floor. The littel fella accused me of being uneducated (I forgot to ask him what the capital of Canada was). The fella said that I should have had the sense to report the leak earlier, judging from the sound in my bathroom, before--he mentioned a few thousand gallons--half of Lake Mead flowed out of the pipe. I replied that I lived in a place where one heard many sounds, including those of ghosts, but the fella said that he was too too busy, and that he should not be wasting his screwed-up life over a harassed nincompoop like me.   Since then I have become paranoid and, sometimes, I imagine the fella sending people out again to dig up my bathroom, refusing even to give me an alternate bathroom, so, unable to urinate, I may die of some kind of urine leak! My fear proved right when fella sent a felli yesterday (sounds feminine? then it's fine) to "request" my permission to rape my bathroom again. Generously, Fella ran inside his office and returned with a key for apartment 127, so if I wanted to shit in the middle of the night, I'd have to walk past 10 houses to this place to shit in darkness, fearing that, anytime, fella's fellows might decide to report me as a housebreaker. I left this morning with good news. One and the only one sensible worker in this Leasing Office told me, pleasantly, that my bathroom was to be reborn today, that one in-house plumber, who had been living in the US for the past 27 years but spoke worse English than a Bhutanese, was fired because he had botched up the work in my house: bathroom casualty.   I added "high" to the title of this blog, because the summer class I am teaching is going well. I prepare for the class as a lawyer prepares for a hearing.
