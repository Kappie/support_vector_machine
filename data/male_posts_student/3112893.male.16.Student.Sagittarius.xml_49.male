Actually, lazy's not the right word, "being in a perpetual semi-exhausted state" is slightly more fitting, I think. In any event, as you hopefully know by now, I'm in LA now. I landed on the VERY early morning of 27th (like ~1:30AM).  So, the day before yesterday I went to work and ended up sitting around most of the day waiting on other people for information and help so I ended up getting very little done, but at least I FTP'd my filed to my computer so that I could work on them. Yay!... I guess. By the time I got home I didn't want to do anything 'cept sleep and/or talk to one of my few friends, so I did just that.  The next morning, I decided not to go to work and do something useful like mask brains because Peter and Co. were coming in from Ventura and I didn't want to miss 'em for work that I could do later. It turned out that they showed up like 7 hours late and I essentially wasted the day waiting. Thanks a lot, guys. When they finally came though, I whipped out my old mic  and we recorded some fun stuff of us just messing around with guitars and singing slow sappy songs :-D. Leave a message in the comments if you want me to post 'em temporarily, meaning for about a week (they're kinda big and long), and I will gladly do so :-). I think it's pretty funny, but that might be because I like to be embarrassed. I don't know why exactly, but I seem to be noticing a pattern.  Anyway, today we recorded another one of those 10 minute session things, ate, walked around, messed with the guitars, walked around my house, and did some other small things like get a Jamba Juice, which, for those of you who don't know, are these fruit smoothie things that are pretty gosh darn friggin' good. I didn't get one though because I didn't feel like it enough to spend 3 bucks on it, so yeah.  After spending most of the day doing things around the house, my cousin and I took a couple busses and our legs to get to guitar center to buy a mic stand and a strap and to try out the electric guitars. We got there and met this guy who worked there named Andy who we later found out is pretty friggin' awesome in terms of guitar skills. We asked him where what we needed was and he pointed us in the right direction and we looked around for a bit and decided that we don't really NEED a mic stand and that it was 25+ bucks better spent elsewhere, or not spent at all. After deciding on that though, we went to the guitar strap section and I picked one out that came out to about 15 or 17 bucks. It's made out of the same material as the safety-belts in cars, at least it feels that way. At first I didn't really like the pattern, but stuck with it because it was the lesser of the many evils. However, after having worn it for a couple hours, I kinda like it. After buying my strap, we met up with Andy again and we got a history lesson on electric guitars and he played a bit for us to demonstrate the difference between the two main types. I was inspired to practice and learn and be awesome :-). I also found the guitar that I want to buy. It's an 800 dollar red fender stratocaster. Ya know, after playing acoustic even for as little as a few months, the electric guitar feels so damn easy. Also the sound is so friggin' cool! Woohoo! I think this might become a dangerous addiction >_  After our adventure in Guitar Center, we were pretty hungry, so we went down, or was it up? Anyway, we went some way on Sunset and passed this place called Mashti Malone's Ice Cream, where Bahador had taken me once before, so we got some ice cream. I also decided that I was hungry, so after getting the ice cream, we went to Burger King and ordered two of those 5 piece buck-twenty things off the menu and he got a drink. We ate both the ice cream and the chicken at the same time, and all was good. After eating, we realized it was late and decided that it would be a GOOD idea to run whiles carrying a guitar stand, 100 CD-R's, and other assorted goodies after having just eating just a few minutes before. I don't know what inspired us to do that, but we did it, and boy did we regret it.  We ended up being 6 minutes late to meet with our ride, so they kinda flipped at us, but they didn't seem to mind too much, so whatever :-). Once we got home, we played with the guitars some more, my mom and fiona made cookies and argued over some stupid walnut issue. It was pretty funny because it was more like bickering than anything else, and over what? Walnuts and peanut butter cookies :-)! Peter danced a bit, Javaneh decided that learning the guitar would be a good idea, Peter and I tried to teach her, Peter and I played a couple songs together taking advantage of my new strap and picks :-).   All in all, I guess this was a pretty darn good day. I got to find my true guitar, hung out with my favorite cousin, bought a bunch of stuff that is normally considered frivolous, but is in fact useful, and to top it all off, I didn't get an ounce of work done :-D. Rock on, Feanor!  There were a few other things that were done today too, but I've forgotten them. I'm sorry that this post was unorganized and kind of like just another brain dump. I promise that I will get this place in better shape soon. Please bare with me :-[ >_  That is all. -- Feanor
