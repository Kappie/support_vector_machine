The best move for SUN would be for all SPARC vendors to stop working on their own interation of the SPARC chip, and instead create a joint SPARC development corporation with SUN and Fujitsu holding the majority share.    What this will allow is for one centre of development of SPARC rather than the current situation now where there is a duplication of development; SUN working on UltraSPARC, Fujistu working on SPARC64 etc. etc. It makes no-sense, and the problem is compounded by the fact that SUN is unwilling to unhitch itself from Texas Instruments.    Wake up SUN, there is NOTHING special about Texas Instruments; its just another foundry that is bleeding your dry. Send them a message, and get other vendors into the competition. With the joint development centre, coupled with a large array of foundaries; from TSMC, UMC, IBM, Texas Instruments and the numerous ones that pop up in the last few years esp in China, the competition will be fierce and you as a hardware vendor will be able to source your CPU's at around the same costs at Dell and IBM does from AMD/Intel.    As for the assembly of the machines, all that should be moved to China; no exceptions. America is still one of the most expensive places to conduct business, along with the UK, so why on gods green earth would any sane human setup mundane production plants in those countries? Assembling a server or workstation is like a lego kit, put the pieces together, test it, then ship it, hardly rocket science material.    As for the product line up, I would focus on making Opteron for the low end and SPARC64 for the high end. From 1x up to 8x CPU, Opteron, for both workstation and servers; all pre-loaded with Solaris (enhancements to Solaris mentioned in a later paragraph) and the complete Java Enterprise System Stack; free for one year - hook the customers in, get them addicted to SUN solutions and start raking in the cash. It is like a drug dealer, give the first hit for free and watch them come back for more.    For the high end, that is >8, SPARC64 will be the dominating product, along with Solaris and the Java Enterprise Software stack, and possibly throwing a database ontop of it; I have a personal bias towards Sybase, mainly because Oracle makes  ANY  system seem crap on the benchmarks. I don't know what Oracle does but it appears they attach a 2 tonne weight to the code behind Oracle because Sybase flies on both Opteron and SPARC when running Solaris.    Solaris needs to be improved, bought kicking and screaming into 2004. It is no longer acceptable having to read 4 pages, edit 15 files and reboot a couple of services just to get a damn non-postscript printer working. The GNU/Linux community understand that, why haven't SUN? why have SUN insisted on sticking with their up-turned-nosed, snobby elitist attitude of "only those who accept unbarable pain are worthy of using Solaris!"?    The fact is, Solaris is a great operating system and would work great both on Opteron workstations and servers, but what is holding it back is the polish that admins come to expect from operating systems. The ability to setup and install things without needing to be a rocket scientist, the ability to simply install hardware without fearing to whether the hardware is supported or if it is supported, you have to stuff around with setting up device nodes; believe me, I simply gave up when I wanted to add a hard disk, reinstalled the whole Solaris environment because quite frankly I couldn't be bothered dicking around with setting up xyz, modified zyx etc. etc. It should just work, detect, notify and suggest a course of action.    All these problems  CAN  be corrected by first of all removing that ugly, bloated, slow and user-unfriendly SDM and replace it with a nice, heavily integrated GTK/GNOME based desktop. From the X-Server up, the end user should NEVER need to touch the CLI unless they want to. CLI usage should  NOT  be a requirement to get things done, it should be an option, just like the GUI.    The end user should able to ask, "should I setup via GUI or CLI" rather than "well, I'll  HAVE TO  use the CLI because there are no GUI tools", the current situation with Solaris is that it isn't the case. The fact is, people are still forced to use the CLI, still forced to dick around with many things to get a simple thing to work; read and repeat; too much dicking around with files equals higher likely hood of error.    I hardly see it as untoward for SUN to sit down and make GTK/GNOME tools that will enable Joe or Jane Administrator setup a server without fuss; want to setup a firewall? then double click on the connection configuration and attach a firewall plugin to the particular connection. Want to use OpenLDAP for NFS, then install OpenLDAP, open up NFS configuration, plugin the LDAP module to NFS and configure.    That is how it  SHOULD  work, not this over the top, convoluted journey into the mythical realms into the spooky part of the UNIX system.    Ok, so we've covered the Solaris and hardware, how about third party software? easy, Mc Nealy, wake up, you have $7billion in cash, get off your ass massager, head down the road, may Mr Adobe, Mr Macromedia, Mr Real Networks, Mr Sybase, Mr 4D, Mr Mainsoft, Mr Corel, Mr Maya, and ask, "how much will it cost to port your applications to Solaris/Opteron", find out the price, and cut them a blasted cheque! is it really that hard to comprehend.    More software plus better hardware plus improved operating system will result in more converts. More converts equal more customers which equal profit. Even for a MBA challenged CEO like McNealy, the numbers are easy to crunch.    The biggest weakness for SUN Microsystems has always been marketing; as I've said previous, SUN is like Digital, a company run by engineers. Bless their cotton socks, engineers are great when it comes to their field of expertise but when it comes to the sales/marketing side, that is, the touchy-touchy feely-feely side of the business, engineers are the last folk you'd call on to hype a product or service.    I personally would run the department myself, knowing what should be done, however, advice to SUN, get rid of who ever is in charge, and someone better. Hype, market, promote and pander. That is what is required. You not only need to tell the local IS/IT geeks that SUN is good but also pander to the technology challenged PHB's. Hype, and it requires using buzz words etc. use them.    Microsofts main key strength is this; they promote, but they promote in the right way. The customers who make decisions aren't looking at IT magazines or sites like slashdot.org or linuxworld, what they're looking at are things like Business Week, Economist or the local newspaper. That is where you aim the advertising. There is no use advertising in things which will benefit you in no way.    Also, when you  DO  win a contract, hype it! document the situation, how much money the customer saved, use that information in future advertising, create promotions around that particular customers experience when targeting that particular market when marketing the solutions.    Customers will be able to relate their business to the achievement of another, and thus, if they see "that customer took a risk, and it paid off", they'll be less hesitant in taking up the challenge to employ SUN Microsystems to improve the companies infrastructure.    So in summary, SUN Microsystems, for as much as its detractors would love to make out, isn't up shit creek with a teaspoon. Sure, they have some management problems, and the problems are fixable, what  IS  the problem are institutional investors in the "old boys club", the corrupt you scratch my back if I scratch yours, nothing more than incestious inbreading which result in incompetant CEO's taking change, running a business into the ground then running off into the sun set with a golden handshake.    That is the problem with SUN, but it is unfortunate that me (no, I'm not joking) could not be given the opportunity. In a true Ameritocracy, the best CEO would make it to the top, not the one with connections, it seems that the one with connections is not only running SUN but running it into the ground faster than lemming off a cliff.
