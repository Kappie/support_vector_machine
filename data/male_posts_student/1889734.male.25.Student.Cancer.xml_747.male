I had hoped to build a place where everyone could debate ideas and post interesting things, seeing how we all live in different places now.  Sure, things are supposed to get heated, but I never wanted to see something like this happen.  I hope Eric returns.  I hope things settle down.  But I still want to play hardball with ideas.  Maybe tomorrow I'll post some more, and we'll see where it goes.
