Everything takes no time at all to load, you don't have to wait for graphics and fancy fucklings to load up- becuase it's all nice and basic and has the bare necessities. And I love it. Each and every of the 1,000Mb of it. Feel free to send me a disgruntled and forced congradulations on (the title of this blog) @gmail.com. Yeah. Woo. Wa-hey. I think I shall sign up for a .NET passport and use it as my MSN account!  Nobodys got back to me *YET* about jobs. And I'm still to go ask down the pub. We'll see, said the blind man...
