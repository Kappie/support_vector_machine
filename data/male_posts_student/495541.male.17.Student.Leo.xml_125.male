While we were eating lunch, her new computer showed up via UPS.  Wow, let me tell you, she was happy about that.  "Oh wow, I can print pretty butterflies with it!" "It's the new, I have the new!"  Wow.  Have fun with the new comp, Maria.  Anyways, practice was alright.  Not too bad, really.  My hip hurts a little.  I landed on it during practice and I've got a bruse there from the other night.  So I'm going to speculate it's going to swell up real nice tonight.  Eh, I can deal with the pain..  Played some pool on Yahoo with Whit.  Once again I knock in the 8-ball like the 3rd turn.  Ehh!  Why do I do that!?  My ratings around 1300, I think.  w00t!  I need to go to bed now.  Night.
