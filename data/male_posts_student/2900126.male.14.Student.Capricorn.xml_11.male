Well i guess i'll start with the lady, she is ok i haven't had any runnins's with her and she seems fine. My aunt has known her for a long time so i really don't care. now to the girls, they are very quiet and only talk to each other so far( i thought " how weird") but hey that completely fine with me so far. so when we came back from seeing Hellboy the movie my grandmother seemed fine. then i started to eat and she called me in her room" alonzo can u ask those girls if they wat to play card, jenga, get, on the computer, or eat or something? treat them like u would want to be treated" i said " why, i wouldn't want anybody to ask me anything seeing how i don't know them and all and they don't know me." i said ok ok and didn't do anything and got on the computer and looked for people on aim. then she called me back in there "did u do it?" i said "no"  she said " yoou all ate and don't you think that they might want to eat?" i was like" mommy there probably already ate before they got here" ( yes i call her mommy) " and she was like "alonzo!!!" i didn't say anything and walked away. then she all came out and walked past me " you still didn't do it did u?!" i was like "no" and she was like " I'm gunna tell lisa( my aunt) about this. go off the computer!!(this was when i was on the computer writing in my blog and had to turn it off) i was lik "ok" and thenm she said " u two girls want sumthing to eat?" they of course said yeah and then i have to make them hot dogs so they could eat chilli dogs( nasty hot dogs) and now they are done eating and sitting at the table talk to each other once again. I don't know maybe it will get better in due time but i don't really care so yeah we shall see sometime in the very near future wht shall happen between these girls and I.
