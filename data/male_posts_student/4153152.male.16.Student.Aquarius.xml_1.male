Maybe it's just that I need to work two extra hours that day. I dunno.  Today's been pretty good. Getting two systems moved out and another almost done. I think a major contributor to my good feeling is the hour-long lunch I took. Maybe strawberry milk, but my idealisms on that are for another day. Maybe tonight. I'm going to take an hour for lunch every work day now.   When I get home this evening I'm going to play some Ground Control 2. Still the demo, though. I want to write up a review on it, but it feels kind of odd reviewing a demo. I'll probably get some time late night to do so. It's an excellent game, and I plan to buy it someday. Someday when I have enough money.  I've had time to think today, and I have come to the conclusion that I like the high gas prices. I would not, in fact, mind if they went higher. It's causing many people to conserve gas, rather than have two cars and use one to drive to the garage and back. Maybe far, far into the future, we Americans will give up SUVs for  efficient  vehicles. It seems like many people, rather than get more fuel efficient cars, just want to bitch about gas prices. There was a fat man on Comedy Central who was just yelling about how he wanted cheap gas from a good place. What an ass.  I'll get back to you when I get home.
