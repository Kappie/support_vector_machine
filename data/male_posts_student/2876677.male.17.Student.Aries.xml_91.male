You are always drunk.  You have gotten used to it. 3. I vividly recall you saying "I love Walmart".  "It is an awesome store."blah blah blah 4. McDonald's does not deliver and last time I checked your name was not Jim Cantalupo. 5. You still beat men. 6.  LIAR!!  I know you have a Crispy Creme every minute on the minute. 7.  All as a noun- He gave his all.  as a pronoun- You are all I need.  as an adjective-   All the windows are open  as an adverb- a room painted all white  8. You lied about your weight on your license.  So how can anything else you say be trusted?  BTW I did not speak, I typed. Much love.
