School was dismissed at 12.50, and we only had a couple of lesson. Literally. We had an "exciting" GP lesson where the climax of the lesson was to do question analysis. Of all things!!! I hate this! Why do we keep doing things like these? First, it was textual analysis. Now, its question analysis. She seems to be enjoying to analysis of things. Sigh. Anyway, though the lesson was boring, nevertheless we tried to entertain ourselves during the group discussion. Talking about all kinds of things under the sun except question analysis. Then we had to fill up a stupid fish bone. Boring! Then they bully me again. Ask me to do the presentation because I'm the only guy around. Sigh.    12.10 was the sacred moment. A group ofabout seven to eight of us left school together. The guard was sitting there, looking at us walk out before 12.50. What kind of a guard is he? The schoolhirehim to prevent students from walking out before 12.50 and there he was looking at us walking out. What auseful guard we have. Anyway, why is itthatalmost all the guards that I see are all oldmen with their tummy sticking out? I don't think they can do anything to ensure the safety of the school lor.    Went toRapture, an annual dance concert presented by our school's dance society.I really admire the way they dance, each step with precision and accuracy. Theymust have trained really hard and long for this concert. Also, you can see the confidence that the dancers havewhen they dance. I really admire them. Andthey also invited guest dancers from the NUS and TJ. But the best part isstill the teachers' dance. Who would have thought that Ms Carol Wong can dance so well?And this MeiSi was like, "did yousee that??? So shocked"Ya... I didn't expect her be able to dance so well, the other teachers were great too. Haha. Mr Lam was also there, although he was quite "masked". Not many saw that it was him...    Towards the end, there was the finale. And it was the best part. Within seconds, I saw Daniel the loser transformed into Daniel the champion as he did the most heroic act I have ever seen in my whole life. He did something that I would never have done even if you point a gun at my head. Something that I would never have done even if you give me a million bucks. Haha. It was an heroic act that lasted seconds but it sure printed a nice image of my new hero, Daniel. Haha. What did he do? Haha. I'm not going to say.    Oh no, the week is coming to an end. And soon the words "6 more weeks" will be no more. And they are going to say "5 more weeks". Sigh. Five more weeks to prelims. Time flies.    Sigh. Time to go to bed. Thank God I can sleep in late tommorrow coz I don't have to go to school for Bio lecture. Unlike some people.    "Success doesn't come to you. You go to it." -Marva Collins
