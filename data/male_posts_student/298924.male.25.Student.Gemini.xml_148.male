Saturday I also bought a much needed table for my apartment and two directors chairs....then I went to a party thrown by one of my classmates....I was supposed to provide the music....instead I brought one decent CD and one TERRIBLE cd....I was too drunk/high to care though....  So anyway last night I go see Martin Lawrence's latest....Runteldat......very, very funny....but what interested me more was the segment at the beginning detailing some of the things he had been through up to that point and his assessment of the media coverage.....I realized that he made several good points about the media's tendency to micro examine the things we do in our daily lives....I guess the price of fame is peace of mind though....glad I'm not famous....  I will never, ever figure out women....in my on going pursuit of this young lady I find myself recently pissing her off with my actions....I admit I do some stupid things but damn I don't really have the patience to try and coax you out of your desire to not want to speak anymore....I have got enough stress in my life....I'm starting to think it's just not for me to even date, let alone get married.....all the verbal and mental sparring....I just don't have the energy for it....life is too big for all that!....and then for what?....so I can have the exclusive right to look at you for the majority of the rest of the days of my life.....ughh.....  Sometimes I wonder what the hell it's all for.....
