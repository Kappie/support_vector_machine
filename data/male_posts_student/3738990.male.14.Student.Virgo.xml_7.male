"Just have another beer, Bill, she'll be alright. All of us blokes are gunna' take you home tonight"  So we piled into Darcy's ute and hit the dirt track Six clambered in the front and fourteen in the back And Mulligan was cursin', and screaming he'd be killed "Then she'll have to kill us all then" we reassured Bill  We pulled up at his house down on Jacaranda Drive Parked the ute and piled out and headed on inside We up the pathway to the door, which opened swift and quick And his missus came out screaming, and swinging that thrashing stick  She looked like a raging mallee bull, ready for the kill We formed a human barricade in front of poor old Bill "If you wanna beat your husband up, then you'll have to get on past us!" "If that's the way it is," she said, "Take this, you pack of bastards!"  And into us she swung that stick, like Bradman with a bat Old Jacko copped a hiding first and screamed like a dying cat She thrashed and flogged the lot of us, half had up and run So I staggered back to Darcy's ute and grabbed his old shotgun  "Just put that bloody stick down now!", I shouted out to her I'll pull this trigger flamin' quick, if'n you don't concur!" She dropped the stick, I looked around, and saw I was alone Everyone, 'cept Mulligan, had fled, through fear, back home  I went to pick that old stick up and break it right in half But she moved not like a heifer, she moved more like a calf And kicked me quickly in the guts and grabbed the old shotgun then said "Get out, you mongrel dog!" and shot me in the bum  Well, you've never seen a man move such, with buckshot in his bum I near on broke the speed of light, as up the road I run And the last thing I saw looking back was Mulligan on the ground Being caned near dead with that big old stick that she'd been wielding 'round  Well the story of that night became a legend in our town How Mulligan's old missus, knocked twenty of us down And she's got a thriving business now, wouldn't it make you sick! She opened a shop and sold our wives a bloody thrashing stick!  So the pub is rather quiet now I think we're still in shock We have an alarm hooked to the bar, that goes off at six-o'clock And all us blokes and Mulligan, go screaming for the door For fear of having to face up to that thrashing stick once more!
