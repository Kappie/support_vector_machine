That is something that I can easily describe over some good coffee, but to explain it in written language is a challenge. It is an important question, and something I want to answer, but the problem is that I am picking up my political work again.   I am involved in an organization called the League for Direct Democracy. We are having our summer conference in three weeks. I am giving a presentation on Hindutva and it's effects in the US. The group is thinking about organizing Desi-Muslims and Hindus against this political movement. But a lot has to be studied because it might not be something that is very useful in mobilizing folks. It takes a lot of my time researching stuff and thinking about its application to US politics. That is why I am not sure if I will be able to put together a good response to Shariq's question.   In one sense the gathering of like-minded folks at this summer conference is what an anarchist community would look like--a community where everyone is working for social and economic justice and the right of people to be self-governing.   Plus I am also working on a grassroots student newspaper called Radical Detroit. We just published our first issue two days ago. Now it is time to start distributing the paper on campus and in the city.  Hopefully in a couple days I will have a coherent statement on what an anarchist community would look like.
