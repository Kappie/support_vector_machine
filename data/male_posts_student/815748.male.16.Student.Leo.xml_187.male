But man... if my parents were Chinese they would kill me.  Even so, I'm going to be looking through my mail for a while.     English   A for the final, A- for the term, B+ for the year.  In an asterisk-note on my last (before the final) essay, I had made fun of my teacher, mentioning the quotation "... because now, the cork has been unleashed."  She wrote that she was the master of mixed metaphors.   I hung out with Matt Woolf during C (study), in TV Production.  Just for kicks.    French   Jean Merlet was there for some reason.  I got A- for both the final and the year.  Not bad not bad.     History   A for the portfolio, A for the final-essay, A for the multiple choice, A for the final, A- for fourth term, A- for the year.  Big pimpin'.     Myth   A- for fourth term, B+ for the final project dealie, A for the year.     Chemistry   I didn't even stick around for that.  I already knew.  73 for the final, scaled to an 83.  A for the year.   Afterwards, I went to John's house, where I had lunch and played a bunch of "Super Smash Bros. Melee."  That's where I am now.
