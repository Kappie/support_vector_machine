I basically spent the whole day workin on my assignments. I woke up like 11:30am, feelin giddy and uncomfortable, but I juz did my work and the giddyness soon left.  In the evening, I went to West Mall to get some stuff. It took me like 1.5 hrs as I was browsing thru some things and lookin out for some stuff. I reached home like 6:30pm, den I realised tt I had 4got to get something. Tt was the Geography TYS. Oh man! Now I'll probably hafta head down to popular once again b4 thurs.  I bought this Vcd titled "Beyond Borders". It was a damn touchin film man. It was basically about this women who had a pampered life in London. She collides with the stark realities of poverty and hunger in the world's most dangerous hot spots. The show is juz magnificent! It's definitely a must watch!  I cancelled my tuition tmr so tt I could catch the match tmr morning. After losing $400 in 2 days, I decided not to bet on this game. Overall I still made some $600 shitz and I'm not gonna put it on the line. I'm currently findin ppl to watch spider man 2 wif me tmr. !@#$%^ can't seem to find any1 yet. Actually they're others I could haf called, but I decided not to. So I definitely will watch it tmr without a doubt, but whoeva the person I'm watchin it wif, I haf no idea. Hopefully, a gal if possible. L0L! If not possibly a close fren. Hmmm, now a close fren sounds more practical cuz I can play pool wif tt person or something. Haha, well I'll stop here for now.
