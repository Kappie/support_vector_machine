B is for boxy, cold and restrained. B is for battery, hatred unchained. B is for buffoon, sweaty and loud. B is for bastard, unlimited and proud.  B is for beautiful, butterfly or bless. But this kind of B has nothing to do with the rest. A bully, so bawdy, with bitterness so brilliant. (I don’t want anything to with all this B-ness.)  Your boxy, battery and buffoon-like behavior;  Makes me wonder if you ever wanted a savior.  B is for bastard, this suits you so well. This B describes the life you lead – You’re the extension of Hell.
