My damn program still isnt quite working, but I'll get it straightened out eventually.  My schedule got changed next week and I almost flipped out, but the days I needed off were still there so all is good.  I have to do all my AP US History outlining tomorrow and then go to BC^3 with Moj on Monday to pull some primary sources to analyze.  Should be fun.  I got paid today which was pretty nice, total $560 deposit which always makes me smile :)  Looks like I'm going to stop ranting and maybe do alittle APUSH work...who knows.
