I didnt see Vengeance, because im a cheap ass, deal with it,  Aston Villa have signed Carlton Cole on a year loan from chelsea, brilliant news, we needed a striker after Dublin and Crouch departing,   actually left a measage on someones blogger a while bk..ladyjericho, she repiled..which was kinda kool.  neways the things tht annoy me will be posted soon.  l8er m.c
