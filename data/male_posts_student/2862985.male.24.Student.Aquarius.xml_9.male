Furthurmore, my computer has been sick these days, don't really know whats the problem with it...Seems like it has been invaded by a large team of cookies and viruses... Sighz..  Oh yah, almost forgot, in case anybody responds to the post I put up a couple of weeks ago, I have to announce that I am now the new owner of Brownie! Yeh Hey!! Was very happy and busy with her these days, as I have to learn how to take care of a dog again. She was not as good as I thought though, always very playful, hee... She would sometimes (depends on her mood) bark at people walking pass my gate and passageway. And she really likes to chase cats and go out of my gate. Last Saturday we took her for microchipping and almost couldn't find her after she ran out of my gate later at night. We searched for two hours and even sat in cars to search for her in the neighbourhood, but to no avail. Kailing and Cass even wanted to come over and search for her. I was almost giving up hope, feeling ultra duper sad and guilty. Then she came back, all BY HERSELF! I was so very happy at that time, I told myself not to let her go away so easily next time... Brown ah Brown..  Went out with Sumitro and Keith last friday. Actually wanted to watch Troy with Sumitro (we keep postponing it for dunno how many weeks already), but apparently, the hottest thing in cinemas now is Harry Porter and we jst couldn't find an appropriate showtime for our Troy, hence we gave up and decided to wait for the VCD. Went to funan instead as Sumitro wanted to change his hard disk. Then we saw Fabian there.. But too bad, we couldn't see Jolin..  Euro Cup 2004 is starting this saturday already...Is actually feeling a bit excited over it now. Hope that Denmark can win the tournament, I always feel that Denmark is one of the best team around.. Hahaha.. Bought $10 Denmark win the tournament at a handsome odds of 36.00 this afternoon... Hope that lady luck is on my side.. Keke..  Ok! I shall stop here... Shall blog again when I feel like blogging.. la di la...
