Today...rather...a few moments ago...I realised that I am a true idjut. NO, not an idiot...but...an idjut. In fact, I've gone to supreme Idjut status. I am officially queen of Idjuts.   I forgot which damn site to update the damn blogs on...*sighs*...kill me...now...   Anywho....   Caleb, you can't complain about magic decks...I get depressed on the simple fact that I don't have one. ..yet..given a deck that I understand well enough...I RULE...but  I dun have my own flippin' deck..  And you have no more bragging rights of slackerness...I passed Pre-Algebra in the seventh grade with a B and never did homework the entire year. Boo-yah.   Also, two to three hours on Imperian? Hah! I was on Achaea and Imperian at the same time last Wednsday from five in the evening to six in the morning. And from five till four the next day. I've got joo beat silly.   ANYWHO!  Monday I'm going to the ICP concert here in Nashville....it's part of the Wicked Wonka tour and I'm like...uber psyched. Remind me to get a picture of me before the concert with my hair in dreds and my face painted. It'll look kickass. And don't let me forget to get one -after- the concert...that one would be even more fun.  .HACK// infection has been one hell of a cool game...so far...and I've not even gotten to the interesting parts....and I still have yet to play mutation...and whatever the third one's called. It's all thanks to my lovely friend that I'm spending the weekend with. Oh joy..oh..rapture...oh..glee......     .....  Yeah....so....yeeeeeah.....  I'm out.  Princess of Idjiotic Pandas, Panda, Accepting applications for sanity    oh...and I forgot...  Bitch, ain't I sexy? Wanna take a ride in my lexi? Well I ain't got a lexi! I got a taxi! So get the fuck in it, floor it, and pay for it, BITCH!.....  there ya go. Random Dark Lotus lyric of the day...
