I was gonna go paintball tomorrow, but now it looks like we're gonna wait till monday because of the rain and all going on. We might still go tomorrow if it ain't raining around 11 or so, but more than likely it's gonna be monday sometime. Well anyways, I might be back a little later, right now I've got some tv to go watching. Yay! TV! Anyways, whatever, peace out yo. I'm just kididng, have a good time ok kiddos?
