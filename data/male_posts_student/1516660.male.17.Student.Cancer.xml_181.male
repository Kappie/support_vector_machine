KY: Study lor......went out lor.....  C: And? Not all study and going out or!   KY: Ayiah...play a bit of games lor!  C: Kelvin Yip! As an O Level cat, you must NOT get distracted! Study is very imp--  KY: Yes yes, I know I know! But the advice in Straits Times said to take breaks ma...so I took breaks in between studying lor.  C: That's no excuse, KY! Alright, what did you study today?  KY: Er, well. I studied 2 chapters of Bio (2nd and 3rd la). Then leh, I completed the theme of Conflict and Co-operation in SS lor. I made notes and everything. Mostly, I copied from notes and added a bit of my own from the SEQ essays I wrote. Then, I did half of Deyi Sec's Maths Paper 1 lor.  C: What? So little? Like that call study ar?  KY: Well, it's very miraculous okay. Normally, I don't even study. In fact, I don't even know how to lor. I never studied before lor. All mostly last-minute revision. So this time, being able to really study gives me a sense of satisfaction. Besides, I completed one theme. Two more themes to go! I think I do this everyday la. Study at least few chapters from diff subjects, so I can cover all bases before the Os.   C: Hmm.....at least you are planning well. But remember, less time on games. In fact, try not to play them at all. Later you get distracted and waste time playing games. Take breaks can la. Go walk around, take something to eat la....    just try not to play games. Leave relaxation at night, okay? I am your conscience after all. I am rebuking you (or    rather, you are rebuking yourself). Must wake up!! Cannot lose valuable time!  KY: Yes yes, I know! So addictive, the games. Oh yeah... lets not talk about studying. So sian that topic! So many people went to school you know! I am like very extra like that. What to do? Parents want to bring me see doctor. And I said yesterday, don't like being tied down.  C: Oh! You know, you had your conversation with CQ just know hor. I know you feel very angry now.  KY: HA! I detest Lai Yit Hann!   C: Detest? Surely it's not that serious. You are just tired of the 'bullying' and wish it would stop, right?  KY: Yeah...which normal cat won't feel angry you tell me? He keeps telling everyone I am gay you know! Spread to the world world every opportunity he got. I really want Piper's power and blow him right there and then. It's getting really old now, that joke. He wants to rest of the world to see I am a gay then he would stop right? I am NOT a gay lor! How many times must I put that idea across? I wish it would stop! I WISH IT WOULD STOP!  C: You know it won't. Bullying never stops. Wendy's right you know. It's hard to stop bullying people once you get started. It can stop, but not unless one party is hurt majorly.  KY: Ya know, I feel like blowing up in his face. I know it won't work, but I really want to do that. How can I let him see that he is being very overboard? It's not my fault if I sit the way I sit, or place my hands the way I place. It's me...I have been doing this for god-knows-when. I don't even do it deliberately! Just natural....ya know. How can he be so superficial and judge people by their cover?   C: Of course I do. I am your conscience. Being your conscience, you know I will huant you if you actually do anything to Hann. You still treat him as your friend, you know, despite the constant 'bullying' and your threatenings to vanquish him.   KY: I am very tired of this lor. I wish it would stop....So depressing the topic!  C: Then don't talk about it now la. Okay...I wanna hear your views on Bio Prac.   KY: Me? I didn't really revise la. Just you know, flip through and tried drawing. All I did yesterday at Wendy's house are revision to me. Hmm...I somehow feel it's not enough to let me pass....just have this insecurity in me.  However, I do feel confident...I am such a strange person.  C: you are just one confused cat. I know you can do it, KY! Just revise again tomorrow. You will be fine la. Go for it!  KY: Thanks! Okay, you know what? I think I stop talking to myself le. So...weird! Ha! I gotta go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
