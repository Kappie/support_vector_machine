I dunno, somehow that poor person always ends up the butt of whatever Mattson's rage turns on next.   Before I forget...  urlLink Bowling For Truth   urlLink LyingLiar.com   Check 'em out.   Also, Dodgeball doesn't look bad... I just really wanted to see the Terminal, which ended up being a good decision, as it is a genius film. I can't put my finger on what I loved so much about it. It had a compelling plot, and was very funny in all the right places. Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are geniuses.   Harry Potter... first of all, I was just digesting The Terminal. Secondly, the whole book and therefore movie was set largely as a mystery, around Sirius Black... I already knew the ending. It was still good, but in a Titanic sort of way, where it was like I'd already been there. But it was still good. Still good.  Monday I've the day off, but I guess m-son and john are working. We ought do something. Wednesday I'm going to Valleyfair. Furthermore, Hobester turns 17. That's just crazy.   And I'm spent.
