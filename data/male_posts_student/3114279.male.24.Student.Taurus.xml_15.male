      If you have asked me recently or ask me now what my favorite movie is, I have replied and will continue to reply  urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind .  I knew as soon as the credits rolled at the end that it was my favorite movie; I don't think I've ever had quite that strong of a reaction to a film.  But I've noticed that a lot of people do not like this movie.  Glenn, I know you liked it.  But you are actually the only person I personally know who saw the film and liked it.  Everyone else I have talked to either did not like it, or has resisted seeing it because their friends or family didn't like it, for whatever reason.  I could be a movie snob and say that they just "didn't understand it," or that it was too "arty" or whatever. But I don't think that is actually it.  But I think it was a fantastic movie that had me thinking about it and feeling it since I've watched it.  So here is my sort of personal "review" of the film.  If you haven't seen it, I'll try not to ruin it for you.  First, I think how you see and feel about this film actually depends partially on your own life experience.  If you have never been in "love," or you are shallow in your relationships, just for sex or whatever, you may not be able to seriously relate.  But the film, for me, mirrored some of my own life experiences.  About six months ago the most serious relationship I had ever been involved in, and the most heartbreaking, ended.  There is a scene in the film where the Jim Carrey character gathered all of the things his ex had given him and even the things that reminded him of her into a plastic trash bag- a few months ago I had done the exact same thing.  The central idea of the movie is the two people go and get all memories of each other erased.  This is obviously sci-fi, and a bit unrealistic, sure, but you can take that as two people trying to forget each other.  God knows I've tried to just forget all of my relationships, especially the last one.  As the film goes on, you start to realize certain things the movie is trying to say:  that maybe it is better to have "loved and lost," that even if a relationship doesn't last forever (and in reality, what  does  last forever?), it is better to have the great memories to savor over time as the hurt (hopefully and usually) wears off.  Most importantly, the film is saying that without facing your past mistakes, you are doomed to repeat them.  You could say that even when you do realize your mistakes, you will likely repeat them.  Would you erase the memories of a hurtful relationship?  In the month or two after she and I broke up, I might have liked that idea.  In the movie, after having all memories of each other erased, they get back together again, though you get a feeling that it might just turn sour again eventually.  If you read the  urlLink script , you'll see the authors original intended ending, which is even more bleak:  it shows the couple as elderly people, getting themselves erased from each others memories again, having had the procedure done dozens of times over the years.  These are themes not typically done in movies, but it's what life is  really  like.  Life is never "happily ever after."  Life is flaws and disagreements and some very dark, hurtful moments.  Even love is like that; shit, sometimes  especially  love is like that.  I obviously saw a lot of the scenes in a personal way because of my own recent experience.  You'll relate to this film if you've ever broken up with anybody, or if you look at love as more than just the typical Hollywood and Nicholas Sparks bullshit.  Love is a terrifying thing, and it fucking hurts.  But, as it is in real life, and as the movie shows through all the cynicism, love is still something that, I believe, human beings need.  Romantic love especially.  I have never felt as shattered and desperately heartbroken and lonely in my life as I did those months ago, but six short months later, I'm still the same hopeless romantic who would still fall in love in a heartbeat.  So there you go.  It's amazing that Charlie Kaufman works in the Hollywood system and gets these movies made.  Adaptation was another amazing movie, and Being John Malkovich before that.  Human Nature was pretty cool, too.  Those movies are thinkers.  Eternal Sunshine is not nearly as much of a brain thinker as his previous movies;  it's a movie you have to think and feel with your heart more than your brain.  Obviously, it is recommended.  Go see it, if it's still playing.
