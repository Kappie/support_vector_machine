Tyke got up and went and got his passport stuff sent in at the Issaquah District Courthouse and then met up with Amed, Dr. Phil, and Macaroon at Tyke's house.  The guys said they were going to do Hamlet questions and that was their reason for getting together but that ended up just being a facade to hang out.  The gang played some cards and stuff but then they decided that they wanted to go play some bball.  They called up Tyronious and Maniak but it took them a while to come down.  So the boys played some raucous games and apparently everyone but Tyke was pretty tired.  Right about the time that Tyronious and Maniak came the gang was thinking about leaving.  But Tyke and Macaroon stayed around and played more bball.  It was fun.  DUI watched from the sideline and cheered on as well.  The new gang for the day, Tyke, Macaroon, Maniak, Tyronious, and DUI went back to Tyke's and talked and got some drinks and then they left for their dinner/mid-day snack at Subway. That footlong sub was just so delicious.  So delicious.  Tyke drove up to Macaroon's after this and Maniak and DUI joined a little thereafter.  They played some Mario Party before Fejj arrived and then Tyke went down to Sunset to pick up Purdy for Quartermania bowling.  They came back up to Macaroon's for a few minutes to play some more games and then they went on to Hillcrest Bowl with Tyke, Purdy, Fejj, and Macaroon seated from left to right/front to back.  Bowling was fun.  Tyke and Purdy made bets on each of the first two games.  The first game was the renting of a movie and buying ice cream for tonight.  Tyke really didn't struggle much at all for the entire game but then at the end he didn't finish strong and he lost.  So he had to pay up the first bet later on in the night.  The second game was for massages.  Tyke just sucked on the 8th frame where he somehow managed 2 gutter balls.  This from the man who bowled a 202 last time at Hillcrest.  So Tyke lost both bets which was a little disappointing but thats ok.  He also got called an "anorexic fucker" by some guy in one of the other lanes.  What's with Tyke and trouble this past week??  Twice now Tyke has gotten some namecalling and head cases against him.  Don't worry, Tyke is a "lover not a fighter."  And he's weak.  Mostly weak.  He just likes to try and look tough-like.  But he ain't.  So after the games Tyke went to JIB for Fejj's win from Macaroon's bet and then back to Macaroon's to drop him and Fejj off.  Then Tyke and Purdy went to Blockbuster to get a movie but it was closed so they went to Sunset to get Purdy's car and then to Purdy's house to pick out a movie.  Tyke picked Bruce Almighty since he somehow still hasn't seen it and it was good.  Tyke paid up with the back massages and ended up giving about an hour's worth.  But it was fun.  The movie and ice cream are still being saved up by Purdy though.  So Tyke still owes that.  Man, today was great.  Good times.  Good times.
