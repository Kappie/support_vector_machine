Ravesloot, Martien Limburg and Ameen Abu-Hanna)  Objectives: To inform the medical informatics community on the rational, goals, evolution and present contents of the Medical Information Sciences program of the University of Amsterdam and our achievements. Methods: We elaborate on the history of our program, the philosophy, contents and organizational structure of the present-day curriculum. Besides, we describe the various didactic approaches in the program and the rational for these. Finally, we analyze the contents of our program in respect to the IMIA recommendations for dedicated programs in health and medical informatics. Results and conclusions: Since its foundation in 1987, the program has undergone several major modifications. From a degree program following medical school it developed into a full-fledged, dedicated 4-year program on medical information sciences training high-school graduates for a master degree. The curriculum has been based from its outset within the University of Amsterdam-Faculty of Medicine. This organizational structure leaves ample opportunity for integration of the informatics-oriented components with the medical and health care-oriented components in the program. Student-centered approaches are heavily employed in the program, emphasizing students' critical appraisal and a style of life-long learning. Overall, our program follows the IMIA recommendations with slightly more focus on medicine and health care organization.    Visions and strategies to improve evaluation of health information systems:  Reflections and lessons based on the HIS-EVAL workshop in Innsbruck  (Elske Ammenwerth, Jytte Brender, Pirkko Nyknen, Hans-Ulrich Prokosch, Michael Rigby, Jan Talmon and on behalf of the HIS-EVAL Workshop participants)  Background: Health care is entering the Information Society. It is evident that the use of modern information and communication technology offers tremendous opportunities to improve health care. However, there are also hazards associated with information technology in health care. Evaluation is a means to assess the quality, value, effects and impacts of information technology and applications in the health care environment, to improve health information applications and to enable the emergence of an evidence-based health informatics profession and practice. Objective: In order to identify and address the frequent problems of getting evaluation understood and recognised, to promote transdisciplinary exchange within evaluation research, and to promote European cooperation, the Exploratory Workshop on "New Approaches to the Systematic Evaluation of Health Information Systems" (HIS-EVAL) was organized by the University for Health Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology (UMIT), Innsbruck, Austria, in April 2003 with sponsorship from the European Science Foundation (ESF). Methods: The overall program was structured in three main parts: (a) discussion of problems and barriers to evaluation; (b) defining our visions and strategies with regard to evaluation of health information systems; and (c) organizing short-term and long-term activities to reach those visions and strategies. Results: The workshop participants agreed on the Declaration of Innsbruck (see Appendix B), comprising four observations and 12 recommendations with regard to evaluation of health information systems. Future activities comprise European networking as well as the development of guidelines and standards for evaluation studies. Conclusion: The HIS-EVAL workshop was intended to be the starting point for setting up a network of European scientists working on evaluation of health information systems, to obtain synergy effects by combining the research traditions from different evaluation fields, leading to a new dimension and collaboration on further research on information systems' evaluation.    Enterprise resource planning for hospitals  (Godefridus G. van Merode, Siebren Groothuis and Arie Hasman)  Integrated hospitals need a central planning and control system to plan patients' processes and the required capacity. Given the changes in healthcare one can ask the question what type of information systems can best support these healthcare delivery organizations. We focus in this review on the potential of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems for healthcare delivery organizations. First ERP systems are explained. An overview is then presented of the characteristics of the planning process in hospital environments. Problems with ERP that are due to the special characteristics of healthcare are presented. The situations in which ERP can or cannot be used are discussed. It is suggested to divide hospitals in a part that is concerned only with deterministic processes and a part that is concerned with non-deterministic processes. ERP can be very useful for planning and controlling the deterministic processes.    Information literacy-what it is about?:  Literature review of the concept and the context  (Kaija Saranto and Evelyn J. S. Hovenga)  Objectives: The use of IT in health care has merged advanced knowledge and skills for health care professionals. Former studies indicate that basic skills in computer use are no more than comprehensive competencies to manage electronically stored information in health care. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature focusing on the concept information literacy in the field of health, nursing and medical informatics. The target is to find out how information literacy is defined, in what kind of context it is presented and who are the focus of interest. Methods: An automated literature search was performed on-line to Medline and by using the EndNote Bibliographic Software. All together the number of papers analyzed was 97 or 78% of the total literature search result. Results: The survey indicates that the concept information literacy does not exist as such in the literature, but it can be found as a synonym to 'computer literacy' or even more obscure concepts such as 'informatics awareness' or 'computer experience'. The definitions of these concepts varied considerably. A variety of descriptions of educational programs were also found, none were based on the IMIA recommendations. Conclusions: In international cooperation such as that of IMIA WG1, a wide range of efforts still needs to be carried out to compile educational programmes in health informatics to enhance knowledge and skills in computer use among health care professionals.    Information content in Medline record fields  (Ronald N. Kostoff, Joel A. Block, Jesse A. Stump and Kirstin M. Pfeil)  Background: The authors have been conducting text mining analyses (extraction of useful information from text) of Medline records, using Abstracts as the main data source. For literature-based discovery, and other text mining applications as well, all records in a discipline need to be evaluated for determining prior art. Many Medline records do not contain Abstracts, but typically contain Titles and Mesh terms. Substitution of these fields for Abstracts in the non-Abstract records would restore the missing literature to some degree. Objectives: Determine how well the information content of Title and Mesh fields approximates that of Abstracts in Medline records. Approach: Select historical Medline records related to Raynaud's Phenomenon that contain Abstracts. Determine the information content in the Abstract fields through text mining. Then, determine the information content in the Title fields, the Mesh fields, and the combined Title-Mesh fields, and compare with the information content in the Abstracts. Results: Four metrics were used to compare the information content related to Raynaud's Phenomenon in the different fields: total number of phrases; number of unique phrases; content of factors from factor analyses; content of clusters from multi-link clustering. The Abstract field contains almost an order of magnitude more phrases than the other fields, and slightly more than an order of magnitude more unique phrases than the other fields. Each field used a factor matrix with 14 factors, and the combination of all 56 factors for the four fields represented 27 separate, but not unique, themes. These themes could be placed in two major categories, with two sub-categories per major category: Auto-immunity (antibodies, inflammation) and circulation (peripheral vessel circulation, coronary vessel circulation). All four sub-categories included representation from each field. Thus, while the focus of the representation of each field in each sub-category was moderately different, the four sub-category structure could be identified by analyzing the total factors in each field. In the cluster comparison phase of the study, the phrases used to create the clusters were the most important phrases identified for each factor. Thus, the factor matrix served as a filter for words used for clustering. While clusters were generated for all four fields, the Title hierarchy tended to be fragmented due to sparsity of the co-occurrence matrix that underlies the clusters. Therefore, the Title clusters were examined at only the lower levels of aggregation. The Abstract, Mesh, and Mesh + Title fields had the same first level taxonomy categories, auto-immunity and circulation. At the second level, the Abstract, Mesh, and Mesh + Title fields had the autoimmune diseases and antibodies sub-category in common. The Abstract and Mesh fields shared fascia inflammation as the other auto-immunity sub-category, while the other Mesh + Title sub-category focuses on vinyl chloride poisoning from industrial contact, and consequences of antineoplastic agents. However, in both cases, even though the words may be different, inflammation may be the common theme. Conclusions: For taxonomy generation, especially at the higher levels, each of the four fields has a similar thematic structure. At very detailed levels, the Mesh and Title fields run out of phrases relative to the Abstract field. Therefore, selection of field (s) to be employed for taxonomy generation depends on the objectives of the study, particularly the level of categorization required for the taxonomy. For information retrieval, or literature-based discovery, selection of the appropriate field again depends on the study objectives. If large queries, or large numbers of concepts or themes are desired, then the field with the largest number of technical phrases would be desirable. If queries or concepts represented by the more accepted popular terminology is adequate, then the smaller fields may be sufficient. Because of its established and controlled vocabulary, the Mesh field lags the Title or Abstract fields in currency. Thus, the Title or Abstract fields would retrieve records with the most explicitly stated current concepts, but the Mesh field would capture a larger swath of fields that contained a concept of interest but perhaps had a wider range of specific terminology in the Abstract or Title text. In addition, this study provides the first validated estimate of the disparity in information retrieved through text mining limited to Titles and Mesh terms relative to entire Abstracts. As much of the older biomedical literature was entered into electronic databases without associated Abstracts, literature-based discovery exercises that search the older medical literature may miss a substantial proportion of relevant information. On the basis of this study, it may be estimated that up to a log order more information may be retrieved when complete Abstracts are searched.    Technology assisted speech and language therapy  (Michael Glykas and Panagiotis Chytas)  Speech and language therapists (SLTs) are faced daily with a diversity of speech and language disabilities, which are associated with a variety of conditions ranging from client groups with overall cognitive deficits to those with more specific difficulties. It is desirable that those working with such a range of problems and with such a demanding workload, plan care efficiently. Therefore, the introduction of methodologies, reference models of work and tools, which significantly improve the effectiveness of therapy, are particularly welcome. This paper describes the first web-based tool for diagnosis, treatment and e-Learning in the field of language and speech therapy. The system allows SLTs to find the optimum treatment for each patient, it also allows any non-specialist user-SLT, patient or helper (relative etc.)-to explore their creativity, by designing their own communication aid in an interactive manner, with the use of editors such as: configuration and vocabulary. The system has been tested and piloted by potential users in Greece and the UK.
