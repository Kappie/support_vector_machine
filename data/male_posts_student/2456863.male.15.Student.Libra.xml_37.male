I didn't write a poem last night.  But I just couldn't bring myself to write something I didn't feel like I was supposed to.  And the only thing I had to write about was suicidal cats named laura.  And I didn't think it would turn out good and it was 12 and I was tired.  (I was at thea's bday party last night)  I reject the idea of "the clan" but if there is one, femi shouldnt be in it.  she's almost as bad as angie, but nobody is that bad so she's just mean.  Everyone has their own friends, and you dont have to be friends with your friends friends.  I still have a few poems from a few days ago to post, I've been busy lately i guess.  "One Hears Voices in these Walls" One hears voices in these walls, Voices which have no home to call their own, Voices once used in great halls, And Voices which can none but moan. Perhaps they come from this volume, It has not of late opened in bloom. -Friday, January 30, 2004   "Come Back" Why did you take Such a long vacation When will you be returning I've heard you're off On a forever-trip Taken to that place From where none return A place much better Than the one we're in Please come back Even if it is Worse here Than where You Are Friday, January 30, 2004
