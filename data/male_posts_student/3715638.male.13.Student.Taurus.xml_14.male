There on Canada because of the Greek Alphabet. The US had the most plain outfits of the whole ones. Its pathitic.   So anyways...   Amanda gave me a link to see the    1985 music video, so its in my pro! I love that song. I think Ally got me hocked on it. Now they are on the Cayman Islands, how boring. I've never even heard of them. I'm gonna go talk to people now and I still haven't seen the people that I met that are going to the Olypmics. One was from the US, but theres so many, I couldn't even find him. The other is from the Virgin Island. WHAT THE FUCK! Yao Ming is a Chinesse resident? Oh, ew, I just smushed a bug on my screne, yuck!    Good luck Amanda at regionals, hope you win a  GOLD  !
