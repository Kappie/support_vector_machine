I didn't do much else in the morning apart from doing my regular post up on Gaming World, I got the 5:20pm train to Chloe's house .. we layed in bed listening to music, it was so much fun just watching her. Knowing that we are ok again, we had fun tickling each other under the covers. After that we watched School Of Rock, (I am Mr. Cool i swear) .. which was fun .. had a pasta bake (yum-yum). Then we went to Bells and got : Skittles, Hippos and a Milky Bar. was a fun day, i loved the moment we had in the bed :) .. i real heart warmer !
