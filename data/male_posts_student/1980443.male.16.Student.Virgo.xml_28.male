I also know that Emmanuel means God with Us.  So, I guess that's in a name.  I guess names exemplify who you are.  I mean, Muhammed Ali wouldn't be Muhammed Ali if he kept his name Cassius Clay, he'd just be Cassius Clay.  There's also nicknames, like mine is Wilbo, and Jon Ananias's is Gumbee, and Larry Wayne Jones is Chipper.  I love nicknames - it's all in the name, baby.  If you have a nickname - please sign my comment list and tell me what it is.  Later Players.  The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will
