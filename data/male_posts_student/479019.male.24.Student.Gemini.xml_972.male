It's sad that I'm dreaming of work... last night was a closing shift, but was a good night in tips.  Apparently  urlLink Stephanie 's car radiator problems is an epidemic, as it spread to my brother and I's car. We're down to 2 cars for 4 people, and some of us have to work!!! Looks like I have to wait until my mom gets home to get to work...  My Chessmaster blitz rating is now 580... kind of crappy...  ***
