The 4 players who have reached this platue are as follows :  1. urlLink Nolan Ryan ,  5,714  Career strikeouts in  27 seasons . this took a long time to get this many strikeouts.Nolan got his 4,000th career on July,11th 1985 against  urlLink Danny Heep .You really don't see very many pitchers staying in the majors 27 years.I beleive that  urlLink Nolan Ryan  was not a winning pitcher by anymeans but he powered his opponents with the nasty stuff. Nolan's career was a long one but his record was 324-292,just a smidge above .500.Now he may have over .500 record,but he also had 2,795 career Walks.Lets just say he did not have great control.   2. urlLink Roger Clemens  has  4,200 career  K's in  20 seasons . Roger got number 4,000 on June 13, 2003 against  Edgar Renteria . He also won his 300th career game, wow that must have been euphoric.Roger has retired once already but i hope that he stays in the game for many years to come.  3. urlLink Steve Carlton  has  4,136 career  strikeouts in  22 seasons . Steve got his joyous number 4,000 on August 15, 1986. Steve had a shaky career he could not control his pitches. The team thought that it would be in his best interest to retire in '86 but it was a no-go for Steve. Later in that season he got his 4,000 K, way to go Steve.  4. urlLink Randy Johnson  is our latest to get to 4,000. Randy slid into 4th place on the all time list on June 29, 2004 against the  urlLink San Diego Padres .  urlLink Jeff Cirillo  was randys victim. Randy achieved this in 19 teriffic seasons. Randy will probably strike out over 4,500 by the end of his career,but there are rumors that he will be wearing pinstripes by next season.It is really unfortunate but it is true "MOST" great players will wear yankee pinstripes by the end of their career.Lets hope that Randy is not into all that "hoopla" and he stays with the other pinstripes, purple that is.   There are a few players creeping up on these 4 but probably will not make the cut .    urlLink Greg Maddux    is the next in line with 2,835 in 19 seasons. Greg says that he has a good 4 seasons left in him but by his record this year he may just want to call it quits after this season.   urlLink Curt Schilling   has 2,642 career K's in 17 seasons. Curt is not going to hit the mark. He may have some good stuff but he is not going to last with his body aging and his hemroids raging.I wish the best for him but,4,000 is not in the future.   urlLink John Smoltz   has 2,346 strikeouts in 16 seasons.John is not going to hit the bulls eye. The  urlLink Atlanta Braves  put him in the bull pen,there is no hope johnny boy its not going to happen.If he was to be pulled out of the Pen he still does not have a chance in the world.   urlLink Kevin Brown   with a career 2,312 strikeouts in 18 seasons.The future is not looking too bright for Kevin he is currently on the 15 day DL (strained lower back). If you ask me that means your too damn old. I would have to say that hell would freeze over before he got 4,000.   Looks like 4,000 is alot tougher than everyone thinks. these 4 guys are going to stay at the top for a long time. In order for these guys to rach 4,000 they need to strike out about 400 average a year for 3 1/2 more years.They are "untouchable".
