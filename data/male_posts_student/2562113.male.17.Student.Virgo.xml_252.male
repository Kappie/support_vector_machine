I finished my last final Wednesday afternoon, and left Albany shortly afterwards. Packing was such a bitch; I couldn't believe how much crap had accumulated in the dorm since I moved in last August. Since I was rushed, I barely got to say goodbye to anyone, however I managed to say peace to some of my good friends in the tower. It sucked so much to leave, hopefully I'll get to chill with my Albany friends over the long summer!   Leaving college life behind was tough, but it hasn't hurt too much yet because I've been having a fuckin great time back home in Rockland so far! Let me recap:  Wed. night: After unpacking a little bit, Nick picked me up and we headed to the driving range. To our surprise, Jay was there along with 5 other people, along with Jon and Chris from Southcott. It was awesome seeing everyone....an excellent way to kick off the summer!!  Thursday: Woke up early and headed down to Nanuet to get a physical for my new job at Tilcon. It was fucking ridiculous.....they examined me like I was going into the military or something.....drug test, hearing and vision test, height, weight, etc. All that for a friggin summer job. Pfft.  Friday: Got a Bo-Bo at Deli Central then headed down to Six Flags Great Adventure with Bob, Andrew, Nick, Xavier, Ed, Matt Vega, Karen, and Katie, who all skipped school for Senior Cut Day at NRHS! Thanks to Katie we all got in at $25 each.....thanks so much! The park wasn't too crowded at all and after 5pm the park emptied and we hit up all the rollercoasters. At 7:30 we went on Medusa three times in a row without waiting in line. As usual we got some smutty rollercoaster pics! The park closed at 8 so we stopped off at McDumpster and drove back home, jamming to Bob's mixtapes the whole way (YATTA!!!!!!!). I, along with everyone else, got a nasty sunburn. However, my sunburn was the worst out of all; there is an outline where my sunglasses were, and the top of my head got burned too. Someone said I looked like a lobster so I gave them my best impression of Dr. Zoidberg from Futurama (I'M DOCTOR ZOIDBERRRRRGGGGGGGGGG). My whole face is just starting to peel. Sucks being Irish (we can handle our beer but not the sun). And when I got home I yacked twice.....there was something brewing in my stomach ever since I ate those butterfly fries at Six Flags.....comparing to prior experiences, it was definately FOOD POISONING. AVOID BUTTERFLY FRIES.  Saturday: Took a random road trip by myself (I've been doing this alot lately.....road trips are fuckin awesome, and worth the gas). I started off by driving up Perkins Drive to the top of Bear Mountain. There were alot of stupid city slickers as usual. And it was hazy so the view was obstructed. You couldn't see the NYC skyline. I then proceeded to drive along Seven Lakes Drive all the way to Greenwood Lake, and then I crossed over into Passiac County, New Jersey. I got so lost in New Jersey but my nifty road map bailed me out this time. After finding my way back into New York I headed home to go to George McElroy's keg party!!! This party was awesome....it consisted of people who graduated last year and the present seniors. I got to see so many people who I haven't seen since last June at graduation. There was a huge beer pong tourney and I caught a nice buzz. There was an impending thunderstorm so I bounced from the party with K-Rod and Adam and met up with the Southcott crew at Mobil On The Run. Talked with them for a while, and when it started pouring everyone went home for the night.  Sunday: Was gonna go bike riding with Nick so I pulled the mountain bike out of the shed only to discover that the chain was rusted beyond use. When I tried shifting gears, the chain would just fall off. So I scrapped the idea of a bike ride and drove up to Farley to play basketball with everyone instead. Went to Hoyers afterwards and then headed home. Later that night I went over to Bob's and chilled with some people that I rarely ever see anymore: Mike V, Littleford, Will, and Jay. I used to be good friends with them back in the middle school years so it was mad fun getting to chill with them again. We shared some old stories and caught up on the years we missed.  Good times!!!!! I thought I'd never say it but I'M GLAD TO BE HOME for once!!!  -BIGsmut
