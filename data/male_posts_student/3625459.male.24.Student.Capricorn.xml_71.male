C I wont say i love you when your heart belongs to some one else... at least the feeling's diminishing... I guess that it will  all fade away, someday.  As Melina said "I just have to let this crush die away ... like all the other ones".  Times you just want to be comforted, but there's no there. I want something to hold on to , some where to belong to. A deep yearning for some sense of belonging, wishing that some one some where can hear these silent screams.  Sometimes i wonder if all we ever want is a little bit of security. Was reading some guys blog about traveling alone , and read a comment posted by another reader .. she had said that its no fun travelling alone, cos there no one to share the good moments with . (That’s true happened to me when i was in London ... traveling alone is worse)  Cant afford tickets for the Dio concert , I mean i can always ask mum for a small loan because I wont be getting paid till a much later date, I just don’t want to. AS much as I want to go, I wont.  At least Whoosh still sees and speaks to me online. None of my other peers do. [ i don’t know what to write .... i just feel so numb ... ]  Lisa was being a B***h today telling me to buy stain removal liquid because her £35 skirt has grease stains on it, something tome me. better to take the easier path and not argue .  Somewhere deep down inside my m1nd I have this feeling that I’m a pushover doll for everyone. Like I end up taking the blame when she’s drunk and decides to fall on my bike. I need to stop being nice to people. People who are rude are less likely to be hurt I guess. Wonder how Viren's doing. God usually keeps ppl like him happy.  The past year seems like a bury haze especially this year .I have so many good things to look back on last year, I wonder if it was the best ever in my life.  Worried about angel too, In away she’s all I got and i cant seem to help her find her way back. Shes addicted to her depression meds. She doesn’t seem to want to do anything. She told me her house is a mess. i know how she feels, cos that’s how i feel .. but then again i cant help her. If i had one wish, I'd make it on her. She deserves another chance .  Didn’t do any work on my thesis yesterday. I have a demo on Monday, I’ll have to ask Pete to have a look at it on Friday . Going to clench my fists, I’ve got to bear this just for 3 more weeks after that I’m outta here.   Out into the unknown, not knowing where    I’d goThe roads they all seem alike    A lone stranger I roam hoping to find a purpose   So with a sense of accomplishment I can die.   Deep down inside I keep wishing that the aircraft I'm gonna be flying in is taken over by chechnian terrorists and hope I get killed ( but thats selfish just cos i wanna die . others needn't ) Its probably because its been hammered down mythroat that suicide is a bad thing and that your soul never makes the transition .. and you'll end up stuck here as a ghost (who'd wanna take such a chance?... you wouldn't not if you are a beleiver) So I guess its ok to get killed rather than take my own life away. I know someday i'll find a reason to live and by then my days will be numbered., till then i'll have no will to live, but i;;l exist.   I cant make a difference, Im not good enough ....   To anyone who actually reads this... my life’s boring for now, I’ll change it .. I will make it more interesting. I still have about 5 years of life left in me. ( I believe that after 30 life’s as good as over ... responsibilities start creeping in)  I still have random thoughts about being a dad. I don’t want a father a daughter, but a son. (Knowing me that might change, I’ll want a daughter when (IF) i have a son).  Watched Ali G on TV yesterday, He’s STUPID. The only thing good about the entire show was when he kept rapping "Ali in the island, Ali in Northern Ireland” .. With Drum and Base in the back Ground (the clip was about 10 seconds long)
