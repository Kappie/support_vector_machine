It was to late to take another exit and the only other exit was AFTER you go over the I-5 bridge to Portland!!! So I was forced to drive to Portland, get on I-84E, then get on I-205N, then finally get back to Washington State!!!!!!!!!!!!! Damn that sucked. It ate up over 2 hours! It was rush hour bumper-to-bumper wherever I went. From now on, after work, I will just tak 4th Plain all the way to 164th to my house. No more chancing the freeway near 5 o'clock rush hour!!!
