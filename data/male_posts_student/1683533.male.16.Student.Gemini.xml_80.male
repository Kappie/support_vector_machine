It is a Michael Moore movie; a man I deeply respect for his opinions on George Bush that are much like mine.  Go rent this movie now, it will be in the new releases section.   I GOT MY REAL MCKENZIES CD!!!!  :) :)....I was takin a nap when I got home from my vacation yesterday, when my mom came upstairs and held up an envelope.  All I saw was "Fat Wreck chords" stamped on the front, and I snapped awake and ripped it open.  I got much more than what I thought I would get.  I got my Real Mckenzies cd which I ordered (and it is really good).  I also got the two posters I ordered; Nerf Herder and The Riverdales.  Then the two extra things I got was a free Comp disc of people from Fat Wreck Chords, Pink and Black Records, and Honest Don's Records.  Then I got a catalog containg a cool little comic in the front and some more stuff on George Bush in the front.  So, I was psyched about getting all that stuff :).  But I am still waiting for my Riverdale's CD to come in...  "They are droppin' like flies, all these punk rock guys." -The Real Mckenzies
