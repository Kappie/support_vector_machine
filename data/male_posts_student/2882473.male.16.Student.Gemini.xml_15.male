You are now privalleged to see: An Earthquake as you open the page A Random Lottery Number Generator Some good music Links to my friend's blogs, and other cool sites Cool pictures A Calculator, if your computer does not have one. A reaction tester thing  Some of this stuff was already here, but still, it adds to the list.  Anyway, haven't been up to much. I've stayed in all evening, didn't do any homework or revision. I saw another Star Wars Kid video - the Kill Bill version. He is just excellent. If you don't know what this is, go here:   urlLink  . (I'm not quite sure how to put hyperlinks on this. If this address doesn't show up, it's www.jedimaster.net.) This will prvide all the info you need. If you can't be bothered to go to this site, I shall explain. 'Ghyslain' is/was a teenager in Canada who was messing about with a metal pole, pretending it to be a double-ended star wars lightsaber. He was foolish enough to film himself doing this. When his friends found the video, they soon uploaded it for all to see. About a year later, over 100 versions of this have been made from the original 2 minute long vodeo. It's just amazingly funny. Watch the original one first. Well, I've said enough about him. Back to about me. Errr.... haven't really got much to say.  Oh well. Bye all.
