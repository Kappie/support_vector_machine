I want to grind them into the floor and stamp on them. I want to put them into a room and torture them. Slowly. Oh yes, they'd both say "But I'd like that" but they wouldn't. They're both just attention seeking SHITS and I hope they're happy together. Actually, no I don't. I hope they crash and burn. I hope they hurt as much as I am.  But no, I'm not allowed to say this, because somehow I can't speak my emotions or "I'm hurting" her and so she'll avoid me and everybody say 'awwwwww'. FUCKING HELL. I want the same rules as anyone else. Put her in my position, she'd be making my life hell. She thinks me feeling like this is a problem for her? TRY BEING ME, BITCH.  Oh, and I'm hard to take advantage of, yes. No-one ever takes advantage of me, oh no. My older sister doesn't at all demand I get off exactly when I say I was going to but be completely off the wall when I ask her to get off because she said she would. Not at all. And I don't sit here every night trying to think of SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN HER because otherwise I'm making things difficult. No.  FUCK THIS. There's only so far you can take someone. You can't fuck with me as much as you may want to. If she doesn't read this, good for her. It'll mean she 'won't have to avoid me'. She can go back to her BASTARD and they can have a nice friendly FUCKING BRILLIANT TIME. She can wank him off all she wants. Just if she kills me first.  Jon Roskilly
