At least i know i'm putting my money to good use rather than earning a miserable 2.5% interest fr the govt. Well, other than that, nothing much for the past few days except meeting up with frens and finally met J. A very close n personal buddy of my gal. It was a strange, trippy feeling. it was odd. i mean this is the guy whom had a rather intimate relationship with her and here i am smiling, chattin with him as tho he's just some guy fren. i'm not sure if that is the way i should be reacting or otherwise. Whatever it is... it was a feeling that took me a while to digest but overall, he is a pleasant lad with a pleasant gf and it was really nice meeting him for the very first time. Happy? not really? mad? neither. So what it is? nothing perhaps. just a peace of mind that's all. at least now i know what sort of person he is and what he looks like. am i being very fair to myself? i have really no idea.
