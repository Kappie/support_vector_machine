Had a great convo with my best bud and it made my week. Life is great again in Mike's world. I bought two new cds too! Good stuff. One is called  Stay  by Jeremy Camp and the other is a self titled cd by Warren Barfield. Haven't had to chance to listen to em yet but I know I'll enjoy them when I do get a chance to listen to them. I also ordered one of my favorite artists past cds, Bebo Norman's  Big Blue Sky . Can't wait to pick it up. Well, off to talk to my peeps. Thank God for great friends...
