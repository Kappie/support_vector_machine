If you are reading this you must really be bored, and you will soon find that I have no life whatsoever, although there was that one time with the dog and the...  What a day. This Thursday (great band) is usually the shitiest day of my two-week school timetable. Well I decided today was going to be different. I woke up normal time, 6:35am, went back to sleep, woke up around 7:10, then decided to get out of bed at around 7:20. The whole getting up part is so time consuming, one day I'm just going to stay there, unfortunately I will most probably be there because I am dead. I had weet-bix for breakfast. So overrated, and it doesn't taste any better when you have it everyday. I got on the bus at 7:55, and decided to be antisocial (actually I didn't really decide to be, it just happens). I sat there with my discman listening to SikTh. I think I need to buy a new cd. Anyway, I got to school, and found out I left my guitar at home. Well anyway I went to the music block, and sat there listening to Yellowcard with some friends, then the bell rang. We went into the other music room, set up about a million guitars (all for me. I'm a hog). Then we rehearsed for our music exam the next period. WE sounded so shit, but that's nothing new. I tuned up a few guitars (still sore after forgetting my own guitar), and the bell rang. We got in a last minute practice, and worked out that it sounded better with the amplifiers blaring at full volume. Then came exam time. Damo got his video camera and decided to film us when we played...WOOO...Vinnie was awesome, he screamed the best he'd ever screamed before I reckon. I just kinda stood there, and didn't really do much. Anyway, we only played two shitty limp bizkit songs, but the only way to get a decent mark is to play what someoen can sing. I then played a few songs for other peoples exams, being the nice person I am.  Third period I was supposed to go to maths. I decided I'd stay in the music block, and I played some songs with my drummer, and ended up scoring a role in the concert monday. I get to play 4 power chords for about 20 seconds. ANyway, I worked out that Three Days Grace's song sounds better when played on a semi-acoustic, so perhaps that is what I will do.  I decided to go to my last class of the day. IPT. Yay, a computer class. I found out my best friend went home cos she was sick, so it looked like a really good lesson ahead (oh there was little sarcasm). We did some shitty practical work on paper (yes practical work on paper in a computer class...go figure!). I decided I'd play solitaire instead. I didn't win.  This is getting quite long isn't it. If you are still reading you are truly awesome. I've never kept listening to me for 30 seconds max.  I caught the bus (damn heavy), then walked inside when I got home (as you do). I thought I should have a piss but booted up the computer instead. Got on the net, created my blog, and I've been typing for hours (i'm not exaggerating).  Anyway I should go have a piss now. My tv is on. Ads are so boring, well some are decent, but these ones are just shit. I change channel, cue metallica filmclip. St Anger is so crap. Back to their roots my arse, this is worse than that beatfish album my grandmother bought me when I like rap back in the day. Thanks grandma, I think it's good you turned me off rap for the rest of my life.
