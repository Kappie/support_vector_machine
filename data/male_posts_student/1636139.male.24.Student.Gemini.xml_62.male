  urlLink  Shade    used to tell me stories about his time at Dawson, referring to it as "the largest English CEGEP in the world", I never quite grasped the enormity of the phrase; until yesterday that is, when I went to Dawson to meet Alex Somma, who teaches a media course at  urlLink New School . There are over 8000 students in attendance at this one colossal building in downtown Montreal.  urlLink Alex has a radio show at Dawson  so I got to be his guest. We made up fake news stories to amuse ourselves, since I don't think many people actually listen to the school radio. 
 
Later that day   urlLink 
 
  urlLink  Shade    took me to an amazing restaurant called Santropol for  urlLink dinner . His sandwich had this delicious hot pepper jelly in it so I picked up a wee bottle of the stuff to bring back to this bland Anglophone province for use with SpucChuck. On our way back, I took a picture of  urlLink this crazy street that had 1-way signs pointing in both directions ! When we got to his place,   urlLink 
 
  urlLink  Finn    was over so I had an engaging  entertaining conversation with them  their mother, lubricated by a lot of wine.
