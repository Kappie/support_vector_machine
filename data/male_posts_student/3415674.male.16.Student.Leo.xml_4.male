Everything is grey The world is out of place  I turn to her and She turns away her face I’d like to think were on the mend But I know its just pretend I can’t fix a broken heart The glass was shattered from the start Now everything I see Is covered in kerosene I’ll watch the match fall Cause soon I wont care at all.
