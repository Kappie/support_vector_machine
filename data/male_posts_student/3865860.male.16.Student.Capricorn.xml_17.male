Not much has happened since i last posted went and bought a cool 6th form suit and some really cool boots to go with it, all i gotta do now is get the shirts and ties :/  6th form is going to be so weird having free periods and junk, also not doing the subjects that i hate will be kinda fun i guess.  I promised myself i wouldn't get bored with this blog thingy and i have stopped posting regularly :(  My life is too boring to put on here i suppose, anyway i updated it so dum de da!!  Tom
