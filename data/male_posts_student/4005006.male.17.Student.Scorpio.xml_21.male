I've been to work for one day, and I feel like I've been working for weeks. Least today was really good... I cleaned the whole damn place till it was immaculate, I'm doing the boys changing rooms now... and I tell you, they're so much cleaner than the girls, by an incredible long shot.  I've been able to finish the boys changing rooms in 2 days compared to the girls in 4... you gals are all messy pigs, clean and innocent and pure my ass... lesbian sex and explicit bondage rituals re-enacted over the large floors I'll bet!       Or is it in my dreams..........?  Anyway, the boys rule, you girls are sick!! Still got another few days of this, my God did I not want to clean this morning, I was hoping and hoping that I would be sent home, I was praying that I might be fired during the day as I didn't want to clean in future... I spent the morning thinking of alternative jobs. Thats how bad things have got.  I just hate myself, feeling so crap. I can't clean, I can't do the most simple of tasks, the most basic, not exercising a single brain cell properly, and I  sucked  at it!! Really damaging to my self-confidence, what little I have. After Emma and all... I feel like I'm worth shit. Can do fuck all... Hehe... Perfect. I'm all alone to say this to no-one.      See you later guys. Fin and his friends are around, gonna go drown my sorrows.      Dxx
