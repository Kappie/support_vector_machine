It's pretty fantastic, fast on 56k, smooth, asthetically pleasing, loads of useful functions, infinate storage, It puts outlook express to shame let alone hotmail or yahoo. the minute i get my next invite you will be first on my list (the first invite I recived went back to me so I could get another account for the sake of extra invites). To tired to talk much now anyway, thanks for the email, i will respond (on here obviously) shortly but at the moment im wacked.
