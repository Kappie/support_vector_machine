On that "note," if any of yall know how I could publish music legibly on this site then tell me, por favor. I was thinking about Internet tablature but then that would be just for guitar unless someone, or me, took the time to translate it to the notes it actually is...  All in all...  Just stating that more new stuff is coming... Sorry to all of you who have actually been reading and waiting... And some new stuff will probably be songs with (fingers  and  toes crossed) music somehow associated.  One whole week left, how fast summer passed...  And one more thing... for those of you who don't know, you can just click the links on the side for the archives to see my old poems and stuff once I start posting more and more things.
