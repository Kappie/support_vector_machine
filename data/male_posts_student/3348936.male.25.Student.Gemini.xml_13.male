However, I had a moment of genius when after being extremely crap for the first five frames (I was in last place), I managed to get 3 strikes and a spare to come from behingd and win the game.  Woo Hoo. After bowling we played for awhile on the arcade machines alternately getting shot and driving into walls.  And then the drinking started.  Oh dear.  It started at The Wash and then Negociants and then James' flat.  And it being the last time that we would all be together (for awhile at least) the conversation got reasonably personal.  So we now know that Geoff is the Slut of the group and James is sweet and innocent.  Suffice to say the drinking went on into the wee hours of the morning and I finally got home at 7:00 am.  To make matters worse the builders arrived at 8:30 and I have been in work all day trying to stay awake.  I think and early night is in order....
