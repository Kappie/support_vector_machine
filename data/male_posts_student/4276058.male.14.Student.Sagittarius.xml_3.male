I now know that youre childish. i know its childish to do this, pricking ppls back behind like this, but i find this effective in venting my frustrations against ppl like you.... wat "pal" are you in the first place... i dont see the right in you calling me not being a "pal", for u yrself dont treat me like one. you call me names... shen jing bing( you do that to everyone) and when i act blur whats the point of scolding me and asking me to empty the rubbish bin just for your sake of wanting to throw some minute litter waste into the bin? i dont get money from you as your maid or wateva, and you dont have the right to treat me that way. i noe i seem dumb in not shouting back at you, for i noe that it is pointless doing so... youd just irresponsibly think of some lame stuff and dismiss the argument. so who says i dont treat you like a pal.... think before you speak. is your brain malfunctioning or wat? in the last term, when you said that you were "becoming stupid", did i say hahahahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahah...... i doun think so.... think before you speak. when i helped you to print notes for bio did i go around saying you must be super super super super grateful to me?, while when you printed a notes for me you rattled the whole day asking me to do work just because of your "work" magnificently done. think before you speak.... really... when i was sitting on the chair of liling's today was there a need to come and shout some wat the hell malay word and laugh so much on it. I had to act as if i knew its meaning and slap you off like a mosquito. what's the supid point of bullying me like that... only babarians do that... do you feel very happy to see me sad? if you are, welcome to the sadistic club. if you arent, youre just a few stones throw from the club. cant you see other ppl not bullying me? wat's in the word sissy that you find amusing to call me? is it the "si" or the "ssy", let me tel you, the definition of sissy is a person like you, going aroung not caring about ppls thoughts and feelings ( i just used a rubbish term) and just laughing off your chair at peoples misery. it's not only me youre doing this too, poor verena is also shot by him many times for saying that her voice is like a mosquito( she does not). whats the point (i noe my vocab is limited) when you just voice out at teachers shouting out vulgars? to MK( our beloved form) and ms soh? is it cool? is it fun? you never learn from experiences. that day ms wong had already caught you and you could still laugh about it. there is no sense of guilt and shame in you... you are a shameful little brat. only always wanting to win( hey theres no such thing as a smooth road with setbacks). You cant win all the time. dont think you win once or twice then zhan zhan zi xi... you dont tell yourself to work hard or comfort ppl ... wat kind of sickening attitude is this? is going to the bb court more often makes you a man? wat are you? trying to boast that you have completed your work and have a lot of time to go play bb and so you can luagh over me and my sorrowful misery? o... i forgot... ppl like you have the most free time to sleep at ten and be hao lian over it... saying you have learnt this topic and this topic... and they are all VERY EASY.... i mean, how can a person say that. other ppl have not learnt this yet but why must you give "VERY EASY" comments about it. So wat if you think your popularity has risen or decreased? are you like trying to compete with me whos more popular also? wat the hell.... i just have to hand it to you... being able to stay hao lian for such a long time. Wait till one day you cant survive... let's see you fall...
