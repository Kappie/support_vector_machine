My first Spring Break activity is a dental appointment at 5:30.  My second Spring Break activity is taking my grandmother to the supermarket.  My third Spring Break activity will probably involve another weblog post.  :)  Two things I'm looking forward to about Spring Break:  1. Seeing friends (and family) I haven't seen since winter break 2. Being able to watch Mets games on TV (even if they're only spring training games)  More later.
