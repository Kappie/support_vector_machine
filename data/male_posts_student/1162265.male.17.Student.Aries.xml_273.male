It is usually most interesting in the time between just before I have a girlfriend, which is only fun in hindsight, to the time where I have the girlfriend, and then the confusion after I break up.  This has really only happened twice, that'd be important, and I can tell I'm getting to the end of the ensuing confusion phase.   I go through a whole pregnancy cycle, re-birth I guess, before I actually start REALLY looking outwards again.  Poetic, yes.  Lauren, oh Lauren, Lauren, Lauren.  Why must you be under so much stress?  I really worry about my cousin dearest.  Holy Demiurge, I guess the Demiurge is holy since he calls himself holy... Whatever, I shouldn't use that phrase.  Great Aeons, Rulers of the Universe! I just realized that BLD (Black Liberation Day) is tommorow as well as Malcolm X's birthday.  I guess that means I'm going to sit outside, or isolate myself somehow, and listen to Malcolm X speak for about 40 minutes.  I won't watch any TV, which means I'll put off watching 'Half-and-Half' until Thursday.  And anyone who laughs at me watching 'Half-and-Half' is wasting their life, Dee-Dee and Mona are both SOOOOOO hot, and they dress so well! Not to mention that everyone the mothers, their occasional boyfriend, Spencer (who Mona is obsessed with but dated this 'older woman' from Britain), I could go on.  The problem is the token gay guy (since it's a black people show, no token black people) is a Filippino who is so overly flagrant, and so unattractive that you really feel sorry for how Asian men get the shaft in the good looks department.  Whatever, I'll ignore the racism for the moment.  Must clear my mind for tommorow.  Ha-Ha.
