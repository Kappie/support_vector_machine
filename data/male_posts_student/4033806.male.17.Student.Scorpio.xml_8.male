Then the annoying one came.. Hi my name is [who gives a shit] I like playing with my friends and dont like George Bush.      Now I could be wrong here, but before I say anything this kid was ten years old, I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm probably right in saying that what the fuck does a ten year old kid who likes playing with her friends know about international politics?!?      I think its sick that kids get it drille dinto them that G.W. Bush is a bad man because he went to war with IRAQ, and if a kid asks why he went to war with Iraq its because of oil?  OIL ?      If a kid asks who the president is, or why we went to war, tell them the truth or tell them they'll find out when they get older, after all you dont tell your kids the postman is evil just because he does his job? Don't get me wrong the postman might fuck up everynow and then, you know sleep in one day or lose a few letters, but still you call him stupid not evil?! It's exactly the same for Bush, I'm not defending him, I believed in the War and I think its  damn  wrong to call Bush evil, Stupid, yes he is stupid, but he is not a bad man!      You cannot let a kid go on television a show which other children are watching and are influenced by and say something as serious and worrying as that, else we are gunna have a generation of rebels on our hands, who to be honest, won't know what they're rebelling against, or at least they wont understand it fully.      I can only think of two plausable reasons that the kid could have said this... One is that her parents told her to, you know totally scripted because her parents are tree hugging faggots who wouldnt understand why a dictatorship isn't good even if theyre Jewish grandparents died to stop one years ago. Either that or the kid has seen some shit like Newsround the bbc news for kids show, which implants it's bias bullshit views into the minds of young kids.      To be honest it could be blamed on anyone but the kid, as son as she said it she should have been put straight, and something as serious as that should not have been shown in a childrens programme, what the hell do editors do these days?      I hope someone sets the kid straight, and anyone who goes around saying they dont like George Bush without a fully understod and explainable reason should be slapped with a trout and stay out of poitics, its people like this that keep Tony Blair in power :(
