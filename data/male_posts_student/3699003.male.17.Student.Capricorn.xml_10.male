Now, this is the second time we've tried this. The first song we put together a few months ago really... sucked. It was copy and paste from biblegateway.com and the lyrics were impersonal and weak. This time we had the chords all arranged and we sat around for two hours trying to think of words to fit the music. Without words, there was no song. So we agreed to both make lyrics for the same song and then slap them together.   Family driving, me tired and uncomfortable..looking for a way to pass some time. "Hark!Fetch me a pen and some paper!!" I start scribbling down random thoughts of praise and worship. One of the lines that I wrote down was "Savior, Redeemer, Most Intimate Friend"... I thought to myself, "wow, what an easy bunch of words to  describe my love for Jesus". I thought of some big words that could anchor some of the verses.. Healer, King, Truth. So these  words and others were underlined and boxed, scattered across the back of an old grovery list. Also written down was "Not backing out, Not backing down, I'm giving my heart to you. Love amazes me, Grace astounds me, Power takes me, grips me." Most of the chorus was already written down on the sheet of paper but it wasn't until LATE that evening that I woke up and felt the urge to start writing. I was really tired that night, went to bed at 8.. got up at 11, ate some sugar, went back to bed. I tossed and turned for an hour or so before going "WOAH!" I need a pen and paper. Some verses just came flying out perfectly while others required a little more time to work out perfectly. Even now, I consider the song to be "in progress." 3 verses, 3 pre-chorus, chorus, 2 bridges. It could be the next big thing on Friday night/Sunday morning. Fast or slow is yet to be determined. It would sound awesome either way.   The important thing is that the words came first, took first priority.. and the music will just naturally follow that. There may be some changes to arrangement as I work out the bugs with my guitar/keyboard in hand.
