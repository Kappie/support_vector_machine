Like im coo wit all the flirtin and stuff and all that, but i jus dont want her hurt thats all...thats what i came up wit, i jus want her to b happy and i want her to find that special someone and i know i cannot do that. I jus want whatz best for her...protective-yes...while i was watchin Swingers, i could relate to the main character, Mike, in many wayz. His strugglez to live life, his depression concernin that girl that he loved left him, the struggle to get back to his old sef and try to move on. When he finally met that one girl, he totally forgot about his ex and totally started diggin this other girl, then finally his ex called him and rather talk to her he talkz to the new girl in his life...and that my friendz is a beautiful thing, when u forgot, u truly forget...i know i have no truly forgotten cuz im still talkin about this shit, but until that time comez, i must live my life.  Mike: Okay, so what if I don't want to give up on her? Rob: You don't call. Mike: But you said I don't call if I wanted to give up on her. Rob: Right. Mike: So I don't call either way? Rob: Right. Mike: So what's the difference? Rob: There is no difference right now. See, Mike, the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. But you can't do anything to make her want to come back. In fact, you can only do stuff to make her not want to come back. Mike: So the only difference is if I forget about her or just pretend to forget about her? Rob: Right. Mike: Well that sucks. Rob: Yeah, it sucks. Mike: So it's just like a retroactive decision, then? I mean I could, like, forget about her and then when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her? Rob: Right. Although probably more likely the opposite. Mike: What do you mean? Rob: I mean at first you're going to pretend to forget about her, you'll not call her, I don't know, whatever... but then eventually, you really will forget about her. Mike: Well what if she comes back first? Rob: Mmmm... see, that's the thing, is somehow they know not to come back until you really forget. Mike: There's the rub. Rob: There's the rub.   Rob: Those guys are right. You're money. Mike: Then why won't she call? Rob: She won't call because you left. She's got her own life to deal with and that's in New York. She's a sweet girl and I love her to pieces, but fuck her, man. You got to get on with your life. You've got to let go of the past Mikey, and when you do, the future is beautiful.
