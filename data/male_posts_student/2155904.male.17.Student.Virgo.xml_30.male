It was pretty good because Tyke got to sleep in until after 8 because of wickedly awesome late start Wednesdays.  School was pretty stupid as usual but whatever...ONLY 7 MORE SCHOOL DAYS UNTIL BREAK!!!  After school Tykie came home and just chilled by himself which is getting kinda boring now but whatever cuz ONLY 7 MORE DAYS UNTIL BREAK!!!!  Later on he went to the Winter Concert and watched Haras sing.  The performances were really quite good.  A pleasant change from the ordinary is a fitting description of the event.  Purdy and Tig 'Ol were there but so were Ekul and Haras' Kram.  So Tyke and Skippy of course sat behind them instead of with them.  Then they would try to talk to either Purdy and Tig 'Ol and they just weren't listening so they decided they would get some revenge.  So they stole their purses and Purdy's sweatshirt (hahahahaha Tyke admits it, he stole it hahahahaha) and then Tyke tied Ekul's keychain to his chair so when he stood up the chair came with him!  Oh that was great!  But really, Ekul is a good guy.  Tyke doesn't really know Kram number 2 but he is probably a good guy too.  Must be to be dating Haras.  The Sly Lion guys are alright but they certainly aren't like the INDIANS.  Or at least Tyke and Skippy.  Tyke and Skippy are in a league of their own.  Not the movie League of their Own, just a figurative league of their own.  So yeah, basically another night of Tyke and Skippy just having fun with each other (and none of that gay fun that some guys have...this was some good old fashioned clean straight fun)  Oh yeah and Tyke and Skippy ARE NOT the same person.  So stop pretending like they only hang out with each other.  They don't have to consult each other on everything and they are not always hanging out!  They are just friends.  Yeesh, some people...
