Besides that, I have been in such a good mood this past week. Band has been awesome. We have gotten so much done. Our freshman are outstanding. We are in for a good season. We are a really small band this year but I dont think that is going to be a problem.  Greyson and I have been hanging out a lot more and I really enjoy the company. He's such a kewl guy and he's the only guy right now who I would let date my sister. lol W/ me being gay and all I hope my parents dont think that we are together. Greyson's mom does know about me and how he likes my sister so that's taken care of.   I am stuck in this situation. I like somebody. ALOT! I told myself though that I needed to remain single. For my benifit and for others. I am not quite sure if thats what I want. I dont do well in some relationships. I dont know why. I think I rush into things and then I scare myself. I am also afraid to tell this person how I really feel too. So, if you read this and you think I may be talking about you, hit me up and let me know how you feel too.
