Since there are only 4 youths who allow us to go to their house, only 12 people can go for this exchange. I am one of them and Wanchoo and Kevin is in my group. Okae, after a small briefing, my group is assigned to Nor Liana's Aunt house, with Well-C tag along.  First, she brings us to her Aunt's house [cos her parents dont live here]. Upon reaching, we greet them with  Selamat Bagi  [good morning]. And we are recieved by a warm welcome by each of the family member. Then, we are asked to sit down and introduce ourselves. That house is fabulous man!! Nor can speak and understand English and one of her cousins can speak and understand Mandrin!  We chat for a while then her cousin show us their room. As we enter, I am like " Wow " cos' the room is very spacious, ceiling is quite high and is very neat!! Unlike mine, very cramp and messy. I also got to know their education system. It's totally different from Singapore.  Their main language is Malay, of coz, then they only get in touch with English when they are in sec sch.  In addition, unlike us, their "leveling" is by form what (number) one.  Then, they bring is around outside to meet us with their neighbours. I realise something,  they know each and every single people in the kampung . They are  very close to their neighbours  to the extend that they actually can enter their houses without calling out for them.  Unlike Singaporeans, most people dont know their neighbours well  [even those beside them]  and some even make enemy with their neighbours.  Besides,  they are not like us lor, only work work work.they have life after school one !  After that, we meet up with the others to pluck vegetables for our lunch/ The Sepilok youths teach us how to choose tapioca leaves that can be cooked and eaten [young ones, green stalks]. Also, cos' we ask for the ferns we are few daes ago in the resort, so, the youths showed us the way, quite far. It is more difficult to identify the ferns that are suitable for consuming....  urlLink    "Wahaha, posing to pluck tapioca leaves" urlLink     After plucking sufficient vegetables, we go back to the houses that we are assigned to. Then, we are brought to the back of the kitchen and started to wash the tapioca leaves that we have plucked. We remove the leaves from the stalks. What shock me is that they use salkt to rub against/with the leaves to clean and sqeeze the green juice [which is bitteer, they sae one loh]. After that, we wash them again with water...  urlLink    "Rubbing and washing the Tapioca leaves with salt...." urlLink     Next, we are asked to open a can of sadine fish. I am surprised that they do not have an can opener. Instead, they use knife to open! I tried to open the can with the knife and it really works and much more easier!!  Then, as they also have  tzutzu  [a kind of seashell, cone shape], we are asked to chop off their stomach as it cannot be eaten. I am asked to chop it. At first, I find it rather difficult to remove but after a few ones, I get the hang of it and find that is is pretty easy [kaka, one hack and it's done ;)]  urlLink    "Wahaha, chopping tzutzu!!  Wa~Ta~~" urlLink     Of course, after preparing these food, we have to cook them. Hehe, my first time touching a wok leh~~ First dish is the tapioca leaves with sadine fish. After heating the wok, we are asked to pour the cooking oil into the wok. It is hard to believe that it requires so much oil! Then, after "frying" the onion and garlic, we put in the tapioca leaves. To my astonishment, they put salt again.... with a pinch of MSG... [What a salty and oily dish...i thought...] Liana's Aunt put papaya leaves into a pot of water with asam and chicken. Next, we sort of fry the tzutzu in a small pot and then pour water in. After every dish, we scoop them onto a big plate.  urlLink    "Wanchoo.... doing the frying...." urlLink     After that, we are led into the living room to have our lunch. The different thing is that we sit on the floor and eat, using our right hand... This is something new and I would never try in Singapore. The lunch is damn nice and memorable....  After lunch, of course, we help to clean up and wash the utencils. We go to the back of the kitchen and walk down a small stairs to the washing area. There, is where we start our work. We have to squard down that type loh.... really something I could not experience at home...  urlLink    "Washing utencils... boo hoo hoo..." urlLink     Lol, Quite nice leh~~ after washing is games time!! They bring in the "crimson" board [Aiyo, i always forget wad is this called] Hmmm... i realise how lousy I am at aiming and flicking the seed, However, funny thing is that everytime i miss, it will reflect and hit and sometimes score! BUT still lose.... Then, I play 7 stones with Well-C. Well-C is simply too fantastic! Imagine, she can stuck at her turn for rounds!! LOL, final score, 440 VS 0 [me zero :'(]. Nice game though.  Wahaha. Then, we go to Every's house and gather. When gathered, we play murderer and I am... killed by detective... then they go and play basketball... sigh* I dont want to play basketball!! So is Eugene and most if the Sepilok youths (female, cos females there play soccer one). So I started picking up 7 stones and ask them to play... guess wad? Well-C take the stones and throw on the ground... saying not nice... haha so  need skills one hor... Well, Mell is also a pro in disguise!!  urlLink    "My group in Every's house" urlLink     Then Joel and company came, and we start to walk to the soccer field where a female soccer team waiting for our challenge.... I wanna play initially but is full liao... Haha, they trash our girls ad 5 minutes later, our gals team come out and boys team go in. Haha, Mr Goh scored a few goals. Their female team really bombastic! Haha, we, the bench spectators make all sort of noise and make Kallang Wave... haha!!  After that, they bring us walk shortcut back to our resort. On the way, we walk to this nice greenery where we take photos.  urlLink    "Nice bo? That is the greenery along the shortcut..." urlLink     Then back to our resort, we learnt Wushu from Weijie (jie) and Zijian. I am pretty enthu because I always wanna learn but have no chance... Wahaha, that's how i end my day... fun? interesting? And the whole dae, wanchoo is being chased by cats ^.^ wahaha
