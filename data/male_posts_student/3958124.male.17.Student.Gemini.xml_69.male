I reckon I'll bee back by the afternizoon on Monday.   Slightly more interesting news alert! Tonight was historic. My friend, Travis Harris, was granted permission by the powers-that-be who preside in The Commonwealth of Massachusetts... to drive! We celebrated by going to the mall and looking at video games, much like we did last week. Only, last week, Noah drove. Oh wait! The week before that, Jon drove us! And the week before that...  Less posting by me (until Monday afternizzle), sooner.
