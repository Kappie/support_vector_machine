I think if you all show up any time after 7:30 or 8:00 that will be grand and the females are welcome to stay the night while the males will be asked to leave about 1 most likely.  DIRECTIONS: Make your way to Rice St., whether it is by taking 229 and getting off at the Rice exit, taking 12th St. to Cliff and Cliff to Rice, or 12th to Cleveland and Cleveland to Rice. Take Rice east for a long, long time until you reach the stoplight at the corner of Rice and Sioux in Brandon. Take a right (south) onto Sioux... follow it for a while, 6 or 7 blocks (I can't remember which) past the cemetary you will see a street marked Chapelwood. Take a right (west) onto Chapelwood and go to the end of the first block where you will find, on the left (south) side of the street a blue two-story house on the corner numbered 209. That is my place of residence.  Additionally, feel free to bring any snacks and/or soda you wish. We will have some food here but I have a feeling the rents won't want to fork over a lot of dough for party supplies. Also, if you have movies you'd like to watch bring them, however we don't have a DVD player hooked up in the basement so they have to be VHS.  I look forward to seeing you all soon.  --Ashley M. Ludewig--  P.S. Girls who wish to stay would be well advised to bring some sort of blanket and pillow because we have a few extra but not a TON and if a lot of you want to stay (which would be awesome and you are more than welcome) we will run out of blankets and some of us will freeze and be pillowless.
