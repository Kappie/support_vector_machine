I was finally able to take it in to get it worked on this past Tuesday, and they said it was possible it would be ready the next afternoon.  Great!  I call Wednesday around noon, and they said the transmission was being put back together, then they'd take it out to test it, so please call back around 2:30 - 3:00.  So I do.  When I do, they tell me that one of the parts they ot in was bad (just a part that should've been a reject off the line) and my car wouldn't be ready until Friday... today.  So I call around 11:30am to ask about my car, and theytell me the truck with the part on it never arrived, so it wouldn't be ready until Monday.  Recap: Been without a care since Tuesday, having to bum rides from people everywhere I go.
