I have this wonderful plan to sit in the common room and drink coffee out of a thermos in there all day. Yes. I aspire to great levels.  But you can not disagree [double negative, naughty me] that it does sound awfully nice. I just need to find someone who likes coffee to enjoy it such moments with me; rain lashing down on the windows outside while we sit in drinking warm coffee watching the more misfortunate people traipse in while we are both roasty toasty.  Just sounds so very snug and yes, I do need to get out more.
