It started off boring as usual, but around the afternoon, Nat called me! ^_^ OMG, she has such this sweet and wonderful voice that definently lives up to her moniker as the Sexed-Up Schoolgirl. We talked for exactly 1 hour, 20 minutes, and 19 seconds, which was a long phone call for me. XD  And that brings me to the suckiest part of today: Nat and I's argument with Marcelle. I told Mar that I was talking to Nat on the phone (hence my "On The Phone" status on MSN), and she asks "Are you two having phone sex?" I told Nat, and us three got into a major bitch fest. This seriously made me realize that Mar is a lying whore. I mean c'mon, she even TOLD ME that she was my whore, then denied it when Nat was in the conversation. And she said some mean-hearted, scornful comments to Nat. >_> All in all, I am so glad that I chose Colleen over Marcelle.
