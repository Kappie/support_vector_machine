They go to Lan parties(they're at TGC whenever there's a tournament) and prance around and play games (and win, because the CS losers are all wussies, they would never let the only girl they've ever been within a meter of lose). They come to these things wearing see-through white t-shirts and short-shorts, and get all the CS losers to sign the shirt with sharpies. Has gaming gone so low as to have it's own form of prostitution? Bawls came in as a corporate takeover, now we need girls to come in and hint to the CS kids that they aren't as much of a loser as they really are!  If this post offends you in any way, like if you are a cs loser that likes it when those girls come and play, or ESPECIALLY if you actually ARE one of those girls, IM me, and tell me how doing this is not a toned down form of sluttery, i might just retract this statement. But until then, this post stands proud.
