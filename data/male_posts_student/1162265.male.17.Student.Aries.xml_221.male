When you black out like that, your memory just goes off, and it's like a million years pass in some abstract realm of free thought and then bam! your suddenly back in your body.  The thing is when you wake up, whatever the hell just happened makes you laugh.  For no real reason you just laugh, and then try and go about your day like normal.  Crazy?  Possible.  I was sitting here, and then suddenly something occured to me.  "Holy Shit, the world is actually moving right now!" It's more profound then I thought.  I was reading Laura's blog, and she was talking about her boyfriend, and I just felt like "Damn.  Other people." I really can't explain what the hell that means short of that now I've gone back into my occultic shell that I retreat into when I'm depressed.
