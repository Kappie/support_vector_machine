I keep playing around with my page, rather than getting actual work done. Last night I was sort of angry with myself, due to my inability to get  real  work done. I guess at least I'm "producing" something.  This page is certainly less  visual  in terms of graphics and a lot more javascript and stylesheet powered in terms of HTML. I think I might change that as right now the right hand section is blank. I was thinking of working some visuals into that column, as well as maybe some transparent gifs up top. I also removed a lot of old stuff / pics off the server. I'll be working some of those details out in the near future.  I think I'll head to campus (assuming it's open) to get work done around 2 - - I hope!  **
