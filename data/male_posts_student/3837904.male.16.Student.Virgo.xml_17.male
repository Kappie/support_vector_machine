Everyone is selling everything, not to mention that some were actually putting themselves on sale due to bad business. Running around in ethenic costumes trying to get as much customers as possible. What a pity. Also had my tamil N' level oral examination and I suppose I spoke my hearts out, the invegilators must have been so touched and just had their tamil rubbed off. Such demystifying convosation titles.
