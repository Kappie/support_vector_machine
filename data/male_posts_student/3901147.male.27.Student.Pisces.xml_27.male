I am none to pleased about this turn of events (sighs).  I also have to give a sperm sample to check and see if my boys are making swimmers properly since we are thinking of having kids in the near future.  Plus I get to continue my discussion with a new urologist about my delayed ejaculatory response.  Let me put it like this...  I can't have orgasms very easily if at all.  Oye TMI!   However, I really have nothing to hide.  Rob
