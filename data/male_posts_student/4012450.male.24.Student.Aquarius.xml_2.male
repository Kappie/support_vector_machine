Instead of working,I'm studying English,and taking care of my grandmother. She lievs alone. So almost everyday,I visit her house. She can walk but it is hard for her to walk by holding something.  She used to live with her son,but he passed away few months ago. However it's not so bad... Why?  I might tell about it someday.  And she has also lost her doughter,my mother. I'm 24years old,and have to work. But if you were me,could you leave her alone?  Now,economy in japan is not so good,I can guess easily that to get job is difficult. So I'm studying English,and I'll have a 'TOEIC'test. I have to study for that test. But I have no time to study.  There are many things that I have to do. Houseworking like wash cloths and dish...taking care of grandmother,going to language school,study for test,taking care of my petdog,and so on... I can do some,but I can't do all of them. For example,if I do housework grandma and language school,I can't study for test.  But some of my friends told me that he had to work from 9 A.M to 1 A.M.So I can't complaine,can I...  Hu,,,(sigh)
