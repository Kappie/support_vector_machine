Firstly those who thought it would be a great idea to end Friends have done so and unfortunately, in my opinion at least, not in the best way (killing off the chick and duck was unforgivable!).  So after Friends ended came a weekend of brand spanking new serieses; more than 20 episodes of old (but very funny) episodes on Friends on Channel 4 for the whole weekend....what fun.  So Friends ends and the good friends at Big Brother return for a summer of light entertainment, jilted love and kraziness..or not.  Big Brother decided to stick a politically minded / misguided lesbian, a few homosexuals, a Muslim homophobe, a few girls and guys and a questionable transexual into a pot and stir things up by getting EVIL...or not.  The tasks are useless, the people mad and boring and the TV is unwatchable.  Even the housmates are so wound up that they decided to take it out on each other in a fight that brought 'security' in and the police so we may yet see the end of Big Brother!  So we win some and lose some right.  Wrong.  Friends replacement, new episodes of Simpsons, is scheduled for autumn so a long and very hot summer of no comedy ensues.  It doesn't look as if we will ever get the greatness that is Scrubs back, and with have I got News For You being a bit off without the discredited presenter to laugh at there isn't much going on.  I watched the fantastic Hannibal for the first time and Silence of the Lambs that premiered and then the 'critically acclaimed' (by some friends as well (A.S u know who you are)) Jurassic Park 3 that is a fantastic joke if only it were a comedy.  And now the end of GCSEs and the beginning of A levels.  Hopefully we can start driving, at 17 apparently to those who don't know.  Anyway this is the end of this short rant so well till next blog.
