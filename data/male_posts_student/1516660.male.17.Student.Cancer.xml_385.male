See! Even cats and ducks should feel honored that they were featured in my dream. Okay. Not really featured. They were there. Right.  Moving on. Miss Yee's lectures were utterly boring. We got back our test. YaY! I passed with 17 over 25! I feel so happy!   Okay. Me, CQ and Gloria left PJ and walked towards Lot 1 for CIP. The library ain't open yet  We went to KFC. CQ wanted to drink Iced Tea so we accompanied him lor. Yes. We drank and talked. Yes. I forgot le.  Right. At 11, we went up. We told the counter staff we are doing CIP. We have to sign in and ayioh, wear a CIP badge! So embarassing! We were so spotted by fellow Pioneers! So embarassing!  Anyway, me and CQ did the Children's section the whole day. Well, also Recreation, Computers and Malay Adult. Anyway, we are stuck at the Children's Section for the whole session. I tell you ar. The children are very inquisitve. VERY! One cat even asked me where are 'the bullies'. I was quite shocked to hear there has been bullying. I quickly told the boy that the bullies were gone. Minutes later, he came back with a book and showed it to me, saying "Look! I've found the bullies!" The book's title was "The Bullies". I was like O.O and said "oh! good for you!"  Anyway, I am too tired to recount all of what has happened. Right. After our CIP, my group met me at Lot 1 and we went up to the library (again!!) to discuss PW. Our survey forms lor. We went down to Macdonalds to eat (well, only me).  Yeah. I am super sick and tired now. We discussed till midnight. Thus, my non-blog yesterday.    Today   Sorry. I am in no mood to blog. Because of my sickness. I just want to sleep. Here's a brief summary, in point form, of today's event.  -->Went for Mrs Tay's lessons. Very enriching. -->Went to Causeway Point to eat with Joyce. WQ came alone. -->We were 30 mins late for choir. -->I feel so sick.  Right. I gotta get going...see ya next time. TaTa! Night blog!
