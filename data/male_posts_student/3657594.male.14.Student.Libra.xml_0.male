A recent study has shown that 15% of all dairy products contain mad cow disease.  To make it easier to remember, the disease has now been classified into many parts.  They are now referred to as: Mad Milk disease, Mad Cheese disease, Mad yogurt disease, and Mad Ice Cream disease.    So make sure to boil your milk, cook your cheese, microwave your yogurt, and melt your ice cream.  We wouldn't want you to get sick.  Also, if you are a farmer, don't piss off your cows!!!
