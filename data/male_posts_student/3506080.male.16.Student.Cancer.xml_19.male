I know I should have held back for her, but I won by... a lot. I also played Morrowind for a few hours, and got killed quite a bit. My character I'm using now is called Ferric. He's a custom class, based on all weaponry. Unfortunately, I recently got expelled from the Thieves' Guild. My mood seems to have improved from earlier. I talked to Stephie, and she seemed happier, so I suppose I have nothing to worry about. May you all walk on warm sands!
