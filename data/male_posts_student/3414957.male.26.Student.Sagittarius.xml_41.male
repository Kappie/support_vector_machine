I just got finished with 2 more poems. I wasnt even trying to write, I just sat down, put on my Spiderworks CD in the server room, yes I used the Developer Machine! I am somehow angry today. I dont know if this is just part of the whole "I dont feel loved thing" i a have been going thru but I will smash it down soon. It wont bother me anymore. Damn its hot in this server room!
