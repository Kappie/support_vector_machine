I don't know what's rumors or what's true, but it's fucking pathetic. There were so many cokeheads last year in the graduating class, and they were all pricks, so fuck each and every one of them. But it's so disappointing to see people, many of which are good friends of mine, go down the same path. Please, snap out of it, and GROW UP!!!  I really, really miss the innocent days of middle school when everyone got along so well.....  :::shakes head and walks away:::
