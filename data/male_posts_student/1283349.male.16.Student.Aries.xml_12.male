This greatest hits album is riff-licious. If I could play a guitar that well, I would also rapidly become one helluva an 80s pop star. Too bad it's the..er...oughts. The mainstream music of today seems to be a whole lot of toneless heavy metal guitar static with raunchy, non too clever lyrics. Of course, there are a few who break out of the constraints of shitdom. To name a few: Flaming Lips (Not too new, I know, but at least popular at the moment) Queens of the Stone Age (They have bouts of crappy song writing, but I like some of their work) System of a Down (While the constant guitar static -is- present, there always seems to be a riff hidden in there somewhere that makes the wailing tolerable) Tenacious D (While the songs are Knock You On Your Ass funny, I've noticed that they aren't half bad instrumentally)  Feel free to point me in the right direction of musical nowness.  -Dice Squirrel Musically 80-30 Years Retarded
