If I went on BB I'd probably be voted out in week 6, the reason I'd survive the first 6 weeks is because I'd probably be a bit quiet and it'd take me a while to become myself, week 5 I'd start arguing, week 6 I'd be leaving to a vast amount of boos, but it would be worth it to meet the lovely Davina McCall. But would I leave to boos??? I mean I do tend to argue but would I be arguing in the right?            The reason arguments occur is because two people have a disagreement, 8 times out of 10 one of the arguees is in theright, the other in thewrong but the people arguing only argue because they believe they're in the right... it's a bit strange, only the viewers of the argument can come to a decision, but usually tend to keep it to themselves because if two of the viewers said Mr A was right and 2 said Mr B was right then we've got ourselves another argument... now I'm probably talking jargon at the moment but my fingers are doing the talking!            Anyway I'm off to bed now, I hope I ever a better sleep than last night. I couldn't get to sleep at all, at about 11:30 I had what could only be referred to as a "sneezing fit." I think I sneezed about 6 times continuous, I felt proper lightheaded. Anyhoot I'm going to bed.          Night Night, Sleep Tight, Hope the Bed Bugs don't bite ya little toe off!
