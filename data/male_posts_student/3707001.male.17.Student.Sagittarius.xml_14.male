So what I thought was the end was really the middle... possibly a very long middle... but one I'm happy is there.  But before I found this out, I decided that I wasn't about to let this get me down.  If I turned around and ran everytime conflict arises, what kinda person would I be?  Luckily, I did go on msn last night, and I did sort things out.  Right when the storm was kicking up again, the person who left me in the lake came back with a life saver, almost losing us both in the struggle.  Don't get me wrong.  I still am a ghost, I still go unnoticed.  I am still that drifter who hasn't found a place in life.  But now I do have a meaning, a purpose.  I again have something truly worth fighting for.  My goal in life?  To make something of myself so that when that day comes I will be ready.  Forever... I seem to be using that word alot lately.  But now I truly mean it, not that I didn't before.  It still feels as tho forever will happen.  But now I can wait for forever happily cuz I got something to look forward to:  another's happiness.  No matter what happens, just promise me that you will be happy...  To my friends: Last post I pretty much gave y'all the cold shoulder before u even talked to me.  Im sorry.  I can't say I was lying cuz I wasn't, at that moment I wanted to be alone.  And I was alone, maybe not as long as I expected, but I was.  My trust in myself, my faith in my abilites... is slowly returning.  It was lost when I started questioning myself, but that has stopped.  Why?  I'm not sure... cuz I reached a resolution I'm happy with I guess, and that has restored my faith in myself.  But when I say that I don't wanna talk to my friends, I mean that I don't wanna talk about IT... I'm always here to talk if u want to talk about something.  To my great friend: I truly do mean it when I call u a great friend.  You where there when I needed to vent... even offered yourself as a punching bag.  Tho it may not seem that way at the time, your insignificant actions can mean the world to someone.  And your's are no exception.  I truly thank you for being there.  To the source of my anger/frustration/confusion/depression/sadness/but-most-importantly-happiness (yes... 100xhappiness :D): I was not lying when I mentioned all those emotions.  Yesterday I felt the most extreme emotions ever: from anger to regret to depression... more depression... then relief and finally happiness.  But thx to you no matter what has happened I will from now on me a stronger person.  So I dedicate this song to you:  Good Man - RL   "You could catch me in the Gentlemen’s club Substitutin’ lap dances just for love, love, love goin’ home to an empty house Thinkin’ who should I call for some fun, hey   I never knew love until you, love Never thought that I’d fall in love Till you brought out of me The man I always knew I could be, baby    I can count the lovers that I’ve had                 [Hook]  And all of those relationships gone bad I wanna thank you for guiding me And showing me love I was just a boy and not a man Falling deep in love was not the plan Baby, because of you and what you do You made me a good man, oh, baby   Used to change my numbers every other week Gettin’ crazy crank calls from them freaks i'd meet  In V.I.P with a bottle of somethin’ Tryin’ hard to push on some heat  ‘Cause I-I never knew love until you, love You showed me a true love You gave me the chance Now I understand how to be a good man, oh, yes   I can count the lovers that I’ve had (I’ve had)      [Hook]  All of those relationships gone bad (Relationships) I wanna thank you for guiding me And showing me love (The love, yes) I was just a boy and not a man (Not a man, no) Falling deep in love was not the plan Baby, because of you (You, you, you) and what you do You made me a good man    Thank you for lovin’ me  (Where is the love that you promised to love and When was the love that we share, where is your love, oh, yeah)  But if it ain't you, my love’s for nobody  (Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody) (Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...)   I can count the lovers that I’ve had  (Baby, baby)   [Hook]  All of those relationships gone bad I wanna thank you for guiding me And showing me love I was just a boy and not a man Falling deep in love was not the plan Baby, because of you and what you do You made me a good man, oh, baby   It’s all because of you."
