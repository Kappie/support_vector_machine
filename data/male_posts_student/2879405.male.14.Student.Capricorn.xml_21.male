Ms Koh had to come down to give us a gentle reminder that the sec 3s are having their CA. But i failed to perform my duty as a class chairman and Mr. Koh had to come down personally to give us an unforgetable lesson to learn. The whole class was made to stand outside the class in 2s and then head for the porch. He mentioned about having the whole class to get caned. every will get 2 strokes. Councillors have  3 and the class commitee to suffer 4. He seemed damn bloody serious and thought this is the end of my flawless record and it would be broken in 8 years (i have not been caned the moment i stepped into the school). Mr Koh asked for a volunteer to be the 1st and without any hesitation Song Yuan was willing to take the 1st stroke of the day(he is a councillor). But Mr Koh requested for the biggest boy to take it. Even before taking the stroke, he weapt(NO INSULTS!!) and was sent back into the queue and Mr.Koh letting us off with a stern warning saying that if there is going to be a 2nd time, councillor will face the axe, class commitee member will be likewise, sacked. The whole class was let off walking back to class without any noise made. It was so unlike of 2I. Then, there were 2 new trainee teachers covering us for 3 weeks(Maths + English Lit). I just dont see why Mr. Koh have to resort to suspension. Gary was one of his victim. He was caught studying Geography in CME lesson and was therefore sent out of class. Mr. Qualye got to know about this and gave him a letter for a new CCA. I felt this is so unfair and mean to do such thing because he already have a bat, glove and more which i think will not be useful in the coming future. Then, Mrs.Sim demanded us to stand for the whole 3 periods and reflect on out behaviour in class. That's how bad the day can ever be. How much worse could it be?
