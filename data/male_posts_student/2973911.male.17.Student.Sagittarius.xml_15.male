When I was in High School, I would dread Mondays for after the decadence of two days sleeping till the sun is already half past the sky, I'd have to drag myself from bed, tossing and turning and groaning. Wanting to go back to sleep and yet can't. I would think to myself, I swear I won't get a morning class when I'm in college. I won't. I won't! I WON'T!!! And then what happens? Even though my classes are already afternoon ones, I still find myself dragging myself from bed, tossing and turning and groaning. *sigh* I guess I'm just a lazy bum, after all.  Rox ^_^
