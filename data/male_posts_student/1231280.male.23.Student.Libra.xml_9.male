That's gonna be awesome...seein' the fuckin' Lakers while on Spring Break. Milwaukee is only a short 9 days away. I can't wait, we're gonna have a blast. Past the 10 hour drive, it's going to be nothin' but beer, basketball and seeing lots of new bars - it'll feel so good to get the fuck out of Kansas! Then, the best time of the year begins...MARCH MADNESS! It'll be crazy for I hear we could have a few keg parties scheduled for that weekend (i.e. buying a keg and drinking off it all weekend during basketball). To leave you this grand evening I leave you with a quote form my man George Bernard Shaw: " It is dangerous to be sincere unless you are also stupid". And as my homie Jim Rome would say, "See you tomorrow, we are out."
