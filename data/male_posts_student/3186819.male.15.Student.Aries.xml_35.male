There is a short list of people I will trust, and once and for all, I will publish the list.  Mother Sister Grandparents (both sides) Myself My Doctor The administration at school My aunt  And thats the end of the list. If you didn't arrive on the list, don't feel hurt. I have a reason for not putting you on (not a close enough connection, you have proven yourself untrustworthy, not old enough to be trusted, etc.). So to those who seem to like to "test" me, go fuck yourselves.
