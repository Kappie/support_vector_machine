Work was slow, so on my lunch break I went over to the mini mall and bought  Bad Company - Jack Higgins , it's all about Hitler and the war. I read about 60 pages of it at work today so I am right into it. I love historical, war-like books. However, when it comes to reading, nothing beats Stephen King, he is my ultimate favourite writer.  Only four days until Canada Day! I'm so pumped, I love being Canadian and I am so proud to live in a country as good as Canada. I hope to go all out this year too. Canadian shirt, canadian boxers, canadian socks, canadian shorts. Trust me, I'll do it. Even if it requires a bit of shopping :)  I laughed today, I got home and checked my messages on IRC. I guess some guy had accessed my site or journal, and he leaves me a message saying  "Do you consider yourself creative and imaginative?"  Like, what the fuck is that? I suppose my thoughts don't render into his mind to well, typical "simple" minded person. It's sad when you see simple minded people trying to compensate. They try so hard to seem intelligent and witted, that it's even more of a joke to begin with. I guess it's somewhat hypocritical of me to be bashing others; but face it; they chose to have a close minded approach to everything and everyone in their lives. If they like that attitude, then so be it. Don't bring it around me.  If people could only understand half of what reality is. It's indeed frustrating having to listen and see all the bullshit that happens. But what can I do? Run a course called  "Mind Training For The Simple Minded" ? Give me a break. I guess it just comes naturally.  I wonder what  honestly  possesses a person to get a rise out of putting other people down. It doesn't make sense to me. For one day I would seriously like to be able to think like some of the idiots in this world, perhaps it could explain their foolishness, llogicality, arrogance and instability.   People that have to impress others are nothing but unstable, mindless individuals.  Anyways, I didn't intend for this whole spiel to be typed all out, but I guess it's too late to go and think of something else to type out.  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Leave a comment if you wish. And no idiots please. Constructive criticism; not impracticality. If its idiotic, I'll delete the damn thing anyhow. :)
