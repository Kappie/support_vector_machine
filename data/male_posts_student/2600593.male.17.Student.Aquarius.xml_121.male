      I loved this song before Shine Down redid it, but now I think I like it more. I just a good song, one of the classics.  Sometimes I just want to be a Simple Man, with nothing to worry about, and just me and my trusty friend the Internet. Here is the lyrics for those who haven't head it.   Simple Man By: Lynyrd Skynyrd   Mama told me when I was young Come sit beside me, my only son And listen closely to what I say. And if you do this It will help you some sunny day. Take your time... don’t live too fast, Troubles will come and they will pass. Go find a woman and you’ll find love, And don’t forget son, There is someone up above.  (chorus) And be a simple kind of man. Be something you love and understand. Be a simple kind of man. Won’t you do this for me son, If you can?  Forget your lust for the rich man’s gold All that you need is in your soul, And you can do this if you try. All that I want for you my son, Is to be satisfied.  (chorus)  Boy, don’t you worry... you’ll find yourself. Follow you heart and nothing else. And you can do this if you try. All I want for you my son, Is to be satisfied.  (chorus)
