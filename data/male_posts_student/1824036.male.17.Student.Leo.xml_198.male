Every off day that I have (other than weekends, because then I will work at  urlLink Hy-Vee ) I will go to the huge town of Livermore and do odd jobs (mow lawn, haul crap around, clean up peoples compost, etc.)    Right now we are seal coating about 15 blocks of city street. Joe (my boss) and I drive the tar machine to Algona, get tar and come back. Because the tar machine is a trailer type thing, we can only go about 35  m.p.h. . So the whole trip takes about 1.5 hours to 2 hours. It is a long journey, but I get payed for it. Then I stand behind a rock laying machine while other guys lay down the tar. I make sure the machile has rocks spread evenly, it sucks.    But thats all I have done. Get up and be in Livermore at 6 A.M. That sucks. But I get about $50-$60 a day (I make $6.50 / hour I think) Its not too terrible of work, pretty easy money, since nobody gets hours at  urlLink Hy-Vee  anymore. (yes even I have been set back)
