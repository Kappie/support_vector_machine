Nintendo DS, originally chosen as the code name, has been selected as the official product name. The Nintendo DS name evokes the idea of a portable system with "dual screens," providing the rationale for the final name. T  he hardware also has been redesigned to sport a slimmer, sharper look. The retooled Nintendo DS features a thinner, black base and an angular platinum flip-top cover. The face buttons and shoulder buttons are larger, and some have been reconfigured for optimum use. The unit includes a new storage slot for the touch screens stylus, and the speakers now broadcast in stereo sound, with or without headphones.             "The Nintendo DS will change the future of hand-held gaming," says Satoru Iwata, president of Nintendo Co., Ltd. "Dual screens, chat functions, a touch screen, wireless capabilities, voice recognition-- these abilities surpass anything attempted before, and consumers will benefit from the creativity and inn  ovation the new features bring to the world of video games."             Software companie  s worldwide have more than 120 Nintendo DS games in development. Nintendo alone is developing more than 20 titles, and in excess of 100 companies have signed on to create games for the n  ew system.             "The innovative functions make Nintendo DS a superior game device, while the chat feature and ability to detect other DS units make it a social device as well," says Reggie Fils-Aime, Nintendo of Americas executive vice president of sales and marketing. "Weve figured out the magic of what makes po  rtable game play so attractive to consumers. Weve defeated nine challengers and once again were prepared to win."                    Nintendo will announce the launch date, price and game lineup for        Nintendo DS at a later date.          Thanks to  urlLink Nintendo.com  for the pictures and information.
