The Canadian born punks, who show a heavy metal influence, have gone from sounding like metal influenced pop punk to sounding like pop punk influenced metal. Incredible drums, ripping guitars and straight up fun songs. They aren’t out to make any points this time. Their last album was full hallow ‘fuck you’ anthems, and as great as FAT LIP on their last album, it lacked substance. This time, their not out to prove that. They’re out to prove that their brand of punk isn’t out, and that they can still rock hard. This the fastest, hardest, and most serious release of theirs to date, and blows away all previous conceptions. Also included in the package is a free DVD, where the band makes a mockumentary about the fake 80’s metal band Pain for Pleasure. It also has outtakes from their latest video, which are hilarious, as they mock bands like ‘Blink 182’, ‘Sr-71’ and ‘Green Day-73’. Makes me wonder how they ever narrowed down which segments to use. Al in all, the record which the rest of their careers will be judged by. Good luck. This will be a tough one to top.
