And my previous entry was probably a must read special edition for many people. So much so that people actually gather and read it together. Pretty amusing, I would have to say. But not many understood fully how I felt when I typed everything on that day. I thank this person, because this person truly understands me. (Besides God.)  Hmm...to be honest it's pretty cool to be the main thing in conversations, but at the same time, I really dread being the center of attraction. So will everybody out there just pretend I didn't say anything? I'm trying to get on with my life here you know. It's like having a paparazzi following you day in, day out.  I wish I could be much more innocent. Like little children. And that's just what I plan to work on. To abide by the will of God, with innocence like a child's. Having an inner child of 1 year old isn't exactly a right thing you know. Some how, I think I foresaw my life now when I was only 6. Because that year, the thing I dreaded most, was to grow up. I didn't want to grow up.  "Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven." -Matthew 18: 3-4- (English Standard Version)  Second thing. I want to be a whitelighter to others in the new year. Not in the sense of physically being able to orb everywhere and appear when the call, but I want to be a guardian to people. Which I always failed to be. Because I am never sensitive enough. I cannot care enough. It probably just wasn't in my character. But people, just let me get on with life and be a guardian angel to my friends.  I need to learn about love. It is something which is so hard to grasp, yet so powerful. All I want is to love like God loves us.  "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another." -John 13: 34- (English Standard Version)  "Innocence is precious and should be treasured." -Leo-
