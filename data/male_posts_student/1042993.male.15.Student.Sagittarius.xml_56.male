Here's my review of Xanga service:  Xanga offers several different "web-community" features such as the ability to give reviews of other people's "Xanga Sites".  My only favorite feature is a service called "eprops" which are a form of rating system that allow you to give a token to a particular post showing how you value it (2 eprops - liked, to 0 - disliked).  Overall, Xanga really doesn't offer that much.  It offers a pitiful comments system, awful templates, and a horrible url system (the format is http://xanga.com/users/namegoeshere).  whereas blogger's is short and easily managed (the format is namegoeshere.blogspot.com).  When you use Xanga, you feel claustrophobic, and that's the only way I know of describing it.  People, go with Blogger -- you'll be much happier -- I promise.    Now, it's my turn to be mean (since Nick has had his  urlLink turn ).  My cousin,  urlLink Rachel , is an avid Xanga user and flaunts her disgraceful love for  urlLink it  and animosity toward  urlLink Blogger .  Xanga is for wimps.... sorry, Rachel.
