Both were originally trained in the psychoanalytic tradition and moved to more cognitively focused approaches. Both try to help clients learn to notice (pay attention to) the occurrence of maladaptive cognitions, recognize their disruptive and destructive impact, and replace them with more realistic and adaptive thought pattterns. Both are programmatic, problem-oriented, and directive. Both give clients "homework" assignments as part of the treatment.    Beck's List of Common Maladaptive Cognitions  Unlike Ellis, Beck does not view these beliefs as necessarily irrational, but rather too absolute, too broad, too extreme, or too arbitrary.   ARBITRARY INFERENCE. This is drawing a conclusion without evidence or in the presence of contradictory evidence, like believing you were laid off due to incompetence when the company is going out of business.   OVERGENERALIZATION. (Same as Ellis.) Drawing a broad general conclusion from a single narrow specific incident.   SELECTIVE ABSTRACTION. Focusing on a detail while ignoring the context--like feeling rejected because a friend who was busy didn't stop to talk, or thinking that the only things that matter are failures, which are the main measure of yourself.   PERSONALIZATION. Mistakenly viewing yourself as the source of some event that had another cause.   POLARIZED (DUALISTIC, DICHOTOMOUS) THINKING. Thinking in extreme either-or fashion.  Dualistic thinking, which we'll meet again later in this chapter, includes either-or mental habits like interpreting a mild rebuff as total rejection  MAGNIFICATION AND MINIMIZATION. Viewing that something is far more or less important than it really is.   Jumping to conclusions without evidence to back them up includes several more specific habits of thought. Among these are errors of omission, like emphasizing a detail while ignoring its larger context, and personalizing—incorrectly referring an outside event to oneself: "She's terribly angry—it must be something I did."   The Intervention Process  Beck's approach useds both cognitive restructuring and overt behavioral interventions. His test of whether a cognition is accurate does not rely on rationality so much as on testing it against empirical evidence. He casts himself as a co-investigator seeking to empirically test his client's beliefs. His style is collaborative rather than confrontational. He gives his clients homework "experiments" that involves actually finding out whether what they imagine is true or not. For instance, a woman believed that one of her coworkers disliked her because he seldom spoke to her. The therapist suggested that she view this idea as a hypothesis and check it out by observing how often he interacted with other women in the office. She was surprised to find that he seldom spoke to any of the women, and finally let go of her mistaken idea.   Therapy includes helping clients ferret out "automatic thinking." First he has to become aware of what he is thinking. Second, he needs to recognize what thoughts are awry. Then he has to substitute accurate for inaccurate judgments. Finally he needs feedback to inform him whether his changes are correct. The technique includes a problem orientation, and provides a therapeutic rationale and a clear programmatic direction.
