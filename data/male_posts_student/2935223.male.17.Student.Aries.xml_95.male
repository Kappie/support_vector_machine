Ya, so I;m pretty damn sad that beating a video game gives me the greatest joy in the world....so what?  kiss my ass!  GOD..that was such a FSKIN' great game!  Seriously, I've never played a better game in my life.  Also, for anyone that's ever played it...we rescued the princess, and the rumors are true.  I got a kool 100,000 gil for doin' so.  I will never have to ask for gil ever again!  NEVER!  Since both people who did so(Rusty and I) got 100 grand...he gave his to me!  So I actually have 200 grand.   I'll probably give it to Steve though...seeing as he's the only person on my memory card besides me...  Then I rode a camel....and saw a pony.  Ya...I'm so damn extatic(sp) right now....it rulez!  I'm gonna go waste energy....sumhow......:- Spense
