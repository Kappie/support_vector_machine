ADT kept calling, which was fun, then our phones went out. sweet. all and all, we finally just pulled the plug to the alarm and locked up the store, right around 11, finishing off my fantastic night at yogis. i just got home and im sure i smell like ass so ima hop in the shower and go to bed.  goodnight funky-t
