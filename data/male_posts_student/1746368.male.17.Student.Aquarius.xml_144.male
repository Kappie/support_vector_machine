My mom said that she would try to remember to bring it by if she has enough time, but I don't think she will and she doesn't either. If that's the case, I will just have to call Dominique and tell her that I forgot. Sigh.  Anyways, I am so bored right now just sitting here in Tech Assistant drinking my Mountain Dew (which my dad says I have been drinking too much, but I have only drinken [drunken?] two in the past three day) Anyways, hoy. I shall be going now. Ta-ta.  "John Hammond: When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked.
