(to Night) The reason I disconnected at 8:30 or w/e was because just as you said "she bitched you out?" my ma came over and bitched at me. *forces a laugh* Pretty Ironic. Like "BLAH BLAH don't you understand the rules of this house"? So I don't think you'll see me on AIM or phone for quiet a long time. Right now I dunno. Its my fault for hanging on the phone anyway and I -could- of not called but everytime my ma yells at me I get sucked into this depressed state and just lose motivation, get angry and freaked out. I dunno....she does'nt understand what I go through everyday of my life. Masking their 'true' son with a mature son. I wish I could come out to her but I just can't. I honesty can't remeber one time my mother has  been understanding with me in a loving caring emotional way. It tears me up inside, I know it. Everytime my ego gets crushed its like a peice of me dies and I get in this regressive infantile state. Its tough on me somtimes. I mean I don't got the worst home life ever but at times it feels like it. I know there are an unconsevable amount of people out there that feel the same as I do or even worse than I do. I just hate it.   Is Infantalism bad?  This question has been on my mind for a long time and finally I want to get it all out. I don't know the answear to this question but I'd like to discuss it between myslef. Is Infantalism bad? Well in one way it helps me cope with daily pressures of life. Expectations mostly. In another set it can be harmful to my social life as well as family life.    Socialy  People might think of you differently. Think you're sick or a pedophile. I learned I am none of these things but I used to think I was no good for society and that I was gonna turn out to be one of those sick child molesters like you hear of on the news. Other people usally don't understand you as an individual. I know I rip on Night all the time for listening to Eminem and 'Punk Rock' but, is that right? To hurt people's egos just because you disagree with something that they wear, do, or listen to? I don't think its right. I'm glad that Night never rips on me because I wear diapers or act childish at times. That could be something that would hurt my ego immensely. If it makes her happy to hear punk rock then i'm happy for her. Just as diapers are for me.   Family Life  This is where it gets tricky. My stepdad caught me in diapers and he thought it was just a phase. He picked me up from school the next day and the whole car ride home he explained to me about maturity and growing up and becoming a man. What does wearing diapers make me less mature or less of a man than I am. I guess this is why I fear growning up, I don't want to turn out to be like my mom or my stepdad. They scare me at times. My mother believing the world will come to an end and my stepdad just scarry. He reads books like national geographic and stuff like that all the time and likes to use facts alot, totally unlike me. I like to use fiction to a great extent. Such as anything is possible. But being this way does affect my family life. I often get into fights and I just want to tell them but I can't, because all the other times I told them anything well they thought I was messed up. My mother tried to get me a phsycoligist because she thought I was "not right" because I drew furries and that I enjoyed writing books instead of reading them. If I tell her that i'm an infantilist she'll prolly commit me to a mental ward or something. I basically think it would shatter the reality of our 'perfect family'.  But that still does'nt answear my question rightly. One thing I've noticed though is I use infantalism as an 'emotial crutch'. Everytime my ego gets 'crushed' or 'wrecked' in some way I regress. Its almost like a mechanism of some sort.  Take in example if my hand is my ego. Like example if my wrist is cracked and cannot operate correctly a 'crutch' is used. like a bolt and screw in my wrist. My hand can still operate correctly but only up to a point. If my 'hand' suffers further damage the mechanism cannot repair itself and in time will snap and break (tantrums and such). Unlike the natural tendons and muscles that can repair themselves in time (without wearing diapers and being completly normal if your ego is hurt it can repair itslef easily). Also my 'muscles' could lose complete control and rely on the 'crutch' for permently (ego is hurt so much that you feel like just being a baby 24/7 and forgeting your problems).  Also my 'hand' can only operate on a limited level (Such as I'm not so open on talking about my diapers much in RL face to face). Its almost like I don't like it or it scares people. I don't think I have come to terms, yet. Of me being who I am. But am I truly an infantilist and its unreversable? Is it not natural? Against the human grain? The human grain usually flows in one direction. Towards maturity. As soon as your born you begin to grow. You begin to get weened off the bottle and eat solid food and drink from the 'big boy cup' and you get rewarded for it. "Oh what a good boy BLAH BLAH...ect." Then you get potty trained and you get praised for that too. "Wow, you can use the potty just like daddy...ect." Then you go to school (yet another sign of growing up). Then you learn at school and take home pretty drawings and hang them on the fridge and such. "Did you make that for me? What a good boy ....ect." Then as you grow up the praise and attention goes away and ceses to exist. When you get in your teens the praise is replaced with punishment. Punished for 'not acting your age' Punished for talking with friends on the phone because you never see them outside of school. Punished for hanging on the internet.   But something happened to me that made me think different about going with the grain of  maturity .  They say with great knowledge comes great sorrow.  You begin to learn how messed up the world is at times. How you're praised for everything at first then at the end you're no long praised but punished and repremanded. This is why I don't want to grow up. I want to go back to the days when I was prasied for learning and learning was fun. When my mother actually paid attention to me.   I think it all started when my dad died. I was 4 years old, I think its amazing how I can remeber it. My mom and brother and sister came home crying and I was left with the babysitter for reasons I did'nt know. I asked why the where sobbing and of all people my sister picked me up and brought me to bed then she explained: The reason the left was because dad got in a bad car crash and died. I did'nt know what to think. She told me dad was never coming back home. As I type this I think of that day and tear up. I remeber crying in my sister's arms and she cried with me. Most of the times I talk with my sister on the phone she tells me about how dad was. My brothers andre and jens and my mom rather not talk about it but my sister likes to for some reason. Maybe she likes remebering those carefree days.  I remeber when my dad would come home from work. I would jump up from the couch to greet him. My mom was usally making dinner and by brothers and sister where often gone to my sister's track meets. I remember my dad. His tacky buisness suit he would take off his jacket thing and we would sit on the floor and play with lego block. I have a picture somewhere of this but rumaging and cleaning things I think I lost it. I try almost everyday I look for it but maybe my mom threw it away or something. She became very unemotinal after our dad died. At least thats what my sister says. She said mom used to be loving and understanding now she just is pestimistic about everything. I don't remeber my mom at all back then.  I dunno I don't blame them for me being an infantilist but its a factor I guess. I just don't know what to think anymore. I know I don't want to be one of those grown-ups that think about all the bad things all the time and be afraid of everything. I don't want to a be an uncaring grown-up either. I like to see people smile because around my house there is never much laughter unless I talk with one of my friends. That always makes me feel good inside. Also I defiedently don't want any children. Might be acward when you're dad tells ya he wears diapers. But I would like a girlfriend of wife that would be understanding in my infantilism. I've had two girls that tought I was sick but one was accepting and she often babied me. She moved sadly *sniffle*  But Hell! I might just give it up some day just because. I really don't like to be hurt much anymore. Plus its very hard to get adult sized diapers or any diapers because I don't live walking distance to any stores or anytime I go to town i'm with my parents or friends that no nothing of my infantilism.  Just get rid of the bolts and screws and go through a natural recovery or is infantalism an actual blue print? From god or...someone has instore for me. Is it against the  grain or is it in the grain? -a very confused wolf searching for the answears to the questsions -Kit Wolf
