That's why I've been a member here for three weeks and already have 62 posts or so.  That's like, a record for the most blog entries in 3 weeks or so.  So, as you probably read in another post, I'm going to open up another blog, that will only be updated like once or twice a week (like this was originally supposed to be).  So, I'm going to begin thinking of ideas for this new blog, and its going to be something original for a blog.  No, it's not going to be a blog about sex stories (ha, like I have any anyway), but, it's going to be something different.  Way different.  Anyway.  The new design at Bagel.Tech is up and running, and I'm even considering a name change on it soon...not sure what I'm going to change it to, but Bagel.Tech sounds kinda lame.  I'll keep you posted on that.  The whole search thing worked out great, and I just installed a newer comment system, which I'll also be porting over here tomorrow.  This place may be running a little funny early in the morning, but, I'm going to try and have the major work done on it by noon.  As you can see, the Tagboard is gone (it's pointless to have it), and everything looks better.  Especially at bagel.tech.  This place isn't going to get a new design, but, there are some changes being made tomorrow.  Join me later tonight for the first installment of eBay Hunter and a brand new Late Night Bloggin', which you'll now be able to find on a nightly basis!  So, until then, don't be a David, go find something to do!
