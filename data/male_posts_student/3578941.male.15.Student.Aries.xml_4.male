So I did almost nothing on Saturday morning Because my dad went to a thing and I didn't have to do chores.  That afternoon my brother got his friend Dan to come over and then took like 3 hours trying to get some of my friends to come over to go tubing and since I don't like to go tubing so I watched my friends Seth and Zach get thrown off of an intertube going almost 30 m.p.h. so that was fun.  After that we had to make a mad dash to go to like 3 peoples houses to get X-box and X-box stuff so we could connect 2 X-boxes together with two TVs but that failed miserably because we didn't have a power cord for one of them.  We just stayed up all night playing Halo and Brute Force and may I say Seth gets really personal and edgy and angry and stuff when he is playing a game, so some parts were fun and other parts would really piss me off, but all in all if was fun.  This morning I left a note to my parents asking if my friends and I could sleep in and not go to church if I read the bible for an hour, it worked.  So I started to read the Bible and found an interesting passage that I am going to share with all of my readers (all 2 of them):  And I saw the Lamb break open the sixth seal.  There was a violent earthquake, and the sun became black like coarse black cloth, and the moon turned completely red like blood.  The stars fell down to earth, like unripe figs falling from the tree when a strong wind shakes it.  The sky disappeared like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.  Then the kings of earth, the rulers and the military chiefs, the rich and the poor, and all other people, slave and free, hid themselves in caves and under rocks on the mountains.  They called out to the mountains and to the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the eyes of the one who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb!  The terrible day of their anger is here, and who can stand up against it?" Revelation 6:12-17  After that I had dinner with my family and my grandma and then we watched 50 first dates (for the second time, for me) and that brings me to now.  I have been thinking of having a Halo tournament or party so if you want in, just talk to me and I will give you all the info.  Thats all.
