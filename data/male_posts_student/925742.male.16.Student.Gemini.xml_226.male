So about an hour or so ago, I had the great idea of taking the chair and RIPPING IT TO SHREDS with my sword.  It worked out really well.  So, yeah.  It was in fragments when I was done with it.   RIP YA TAH SHREDS!  Aaaaah.... booze.  Can't a fool drink in peace?    Extra credit to whomever can flooble chat box the name of whoever said that.
