( I swear he is asian cause he can play DDR like a mofo)  I was listening to the songs and sense I am a man who enjoys all sorts of music even if it is  corny and lame I may like it.  But dont get me wrong, about 80% of the songs on DDR suck.    But I just got down listening to this one song that like blew my mind away.  It was like why the hell am I not at a rave right now?  Which makes me think,  That would be so fucking cool if the school put on a rave with good lights and good dance music.  Not the whole bump and gring to the gangsta/hiphop beats which is cool but more of the Crazy liquid dancing  music.  I would say, " Why dont they play both?" but I know the answer to that, its a very strong change and every one would just be like "WTF Mate?" It would throw every ones grove off.  I have not gone to alot of dances but the ones I went to were pretty sad excpet one at chs I went to was pretty cool.  They had like dancing tables where like people would just get on and grind.  It was crazy cool but umm the bad thing was it wasnt just a dance table full of woman, there was men up there too and the table was full and more then likly your touching some man. lol  They werent tables... that would be unsafe but like little stages just in random places by the music.  The school should do like a dance during cluture week or ANYTHING for a reason to throw a rave.  (culture week was pretty random)  They should have kick ass lights, smoke machines and a good live dj!  Someone good like dj teisto or dj doeboy or dj extacy or dj speed... the list goes on and on.  If they cant get a dj to spin and mix up some songs for the dance then get a good cd with alot good dance music.  Hmm,  I think I'm just in the mood to dance lol and want to watch alot of poeple liquid dance.  Allthough its a very strange way to dance if you think about it,  Its like one of my fav things to watch.  Every body has their style and its just fun to watch people. This is just a pointless random thought that went through my mind like 10 mins ago.  Anyways I need to think of some things to do in Texas.  Right now I have Paintball,shoot lots of guns,eat and shop.  Thats about it.  My dad wants me to come up with more stuff to do.  And can you belive that fool is going to let me drive his car while he is at work any where I want!  BWAHAHA  a car that I can drive all I want in a state away from home with many new things to do and a bunch of money.  I'm bound to get into some kind of trouble.
