Lets just start at the beginning of my absensce and work forward shall we? I went to my grandparents house in Arizona for Christmas and just hung out with the redneck kin for about a week and a half. Had lots of food. (Hmmmm.... fooooddd..) I got a new computer and a cable conncetion for christmas, and my dad bought himself a new car so i kind of inverbaitimly got the Saturn. But hell im not complaining. We got back just in time for me to go and see the Rose Parade with Sara Kaplan and her family as well as someone I didnt expect to see.     Gina Hooper, the little sister of Todd Hooper ,whom ive been a friend with since about the fourth grade,was there. Now, Gina is an 8th grader and im a Junior, so the last thing I was thinking about when I walked into Sara's house was: how can I hook up with someone three years younger then I am? Thats kind of what ended up happening though, as me and Gina spent most of the time flirting. I went home feeling happy that I had connected with a great person and that she felt similarly, but also feeling a little weird. Well, once Todd found out he was neigh pleased and made it his mission to rip my head off and fead it to a pack of rabid mongesses whenever he got the chance.  Once I got the Internet back we started talking but as some time whent by she felt her parents wouldnt approve so she wanted to scale things back. I dont know what she thinks at this point, but im always here.     My birthday has come and gone, with little fanfare, and yet again I squandered what money I was granted. I have an 88.1 percent in my Ap History class, and its only going up as we do more homework, but when ever we take a test it gets kicked in the nuts for at least 5%. Jazz band has become increasingly hard, as Mr. Witten is now forceing us to memorize scales. So far we have tested on the Blues scales and the Major scales, each test i have througly bombed worse then Dubba bombed Saddam. Monday we test on the Mixolydian Mode (Major Scales with a lowered Seventh scale degree), and I have finally had a free weekend in which to practice. My horn is in my living room and it will be superglued to my mouth all day tommorrow and Sunday. I think i can get this one down pat. All of my other classes remain the same.     I saw Mel Gibson's controversial film, "The Passion of The Christ" and found it to be one of the most enjoyable, moving experiances ive ever had at the Movies. The violence, condemmed by some as excessive is very effective at showing the inhumanity of man, and at the same thime it did not feel excessive as it was done completely in context. There are two scenes that are now eternaly burned into the back of my skull. Prior to the crucifixtion the Roman's are torturing Jesus they whip his back with a Cat-o-Nine tails that has fish hooks on the end. The Roman over-extended and rips the... well, Jesus out of him, exposeing three of his ribs to the air. Then, at the actual Crucifixtion jesus does not fit onto the cross. One of the Romans comes over and, in one of the most callous desplays i have ever seen, knocks the other two Centurions out of the way and says 'Let me show you how it's done." He grabs Jesus' arm and pulls until you can hear the gut-wrenching pop of the shoulder dislocating from the socket. All through out the movie the singular thought that appeared in my head in between the moments of horrific mutilation and dietal self-sacrifice was "I'm going to hell. Mary Magdaline is hot. And thats all I can think about as God is dieing in front of me. Im going to hell."   Sadie Hawkins is coming up and it symbolizes the second most single depressing times to be a single guy of the year (the first being Valentine's Day of coarse.). I am, yet again, single and waiting in pointless anticipation for someone to ask me. I reiterate my point from the last time I posted.  I need a chick sooooooooooooo................. bad.   Lol, o well. Night everybody and have a good time. Just remember: Jesus loves you but everybody else thinks your a cock.
