Last January, Rusty was a defense attorney who received a directed verdict in his favor.  In that case, certain of the plaintiff's witnesses did not appear on time and therefore failed to help plaintiff establish his cause of action's essential elements.  Now as a witness in July, Rusty played the part of a cardiologist for a plaintiff whose three-party trial began at 2:15 pm and ended at 2:30 am.  Although two-day cases have lasted for a greater total number of hours, I am hard-pressed to think of Big Trial case that lasted for a longer   continuous   time.  Do any Practice Court alumni recall longer stretches?
