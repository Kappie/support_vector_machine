I'm so cool because I'm in college!"  freshmen .  Fucking children. I'm going to be 25 in a few weeks. That means these kids were 11 when I was a freshman in college. I feel so fucking old. The professor seemed nice enough, but did he really have to lecture the entire hour and a half on the first day of class?..with the fucking a/c turned OFF during the first 15 minutes? I was sweating like a fat bitch in there. Grace didn't have class at that time (her physics class at Richland doesn't start until next week) so she sat through it all with me. She really is the bestest.      I finally made it to the gym after class. The Vegas trip really threw me off schedule so I spent a good chunk of the morning thinking how I should revamp my training split. After much deliberation, I decided I'm just too fucking anal to start a new routine. So instead, I'm just going to restart the cycle with chest/shoulders today, skip back/traps this week since I already worked them, hit arms on Saturday, and finally legs on Monday. I actually had to think long and hard before making this decision. I'm such a dork. Oh but I did manage to set a new pr today on the incline. Ima be a big boy.      My 5:30 government 2 class was also rather boring. Thankfully the class size was much smaller. Unfortunately all the girls in there were fugly as hell so there was nothing to keep me awake. Only kidding of course..I never look at other girls right honey? We bought our books afterwards at Off Campus and then came home for dinner and abc's Extreme Makeover. And also some sweet, sweet lovin'. heehee I'm such a kidder.
