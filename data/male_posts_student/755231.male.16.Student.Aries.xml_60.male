Hehe at least I get to play wif my nephew, gabriels, stuff :) WEEEE! A Bubble Lawn Mower. They are gone right now and I�m waiting to call Night soon. So, I�m just playing with all the toddler toys. Its pretty fun. Wow, has Gabriel grown, man he�s calling me Uncle giggles at least he does�nt say Adan or something stupid like that. I hate my name and I�ll say that time and time again. 	I�m obessed with the animation on fox and the hound. Its animation is done so the characters hardly look the same in each shot but you know its them. It just seems far more natural. Even if a talking fox and dog is�nt naturally natural. It has a lot more feeling put into the characters unlike most of the new Disney. Spirt was an ok one but its use of 3d made it seem kind of cold. I really did�nt not like the expression of the horses. I guess I�m really strict when it comes to movies. Well okies time to do some chores and maybe call Slade.  -warm wuff cub hugs -Kit Wolf  Blast in the past hehe Thought i'd post it....
