So i started Kings of Chaos age 3, adn i got caught up in that. OUT OF 150,000 players i am now ranked 9,968 so HAHAHAHAHAHAH. it was worth it. if you want to help click my link, which i will post late. each click adds a soldier to my army. my income is based on teh numbr of soldiers i have. so yAY
