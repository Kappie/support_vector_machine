Thanks to Punxsutawney Phil, for making the final dissection  if we’ll have another 6 weeks of winter or have spring arrive soon, he’s decided to put all us East Bay-ers in hell by giving us another 6 weeks of cold, wet, and depressing  weather. Too bad. Hopefully the damn thing will be wrong, and we won’t have to rely on a groundhog as our forecaster. Oh well. But there’s one thing I just realized today about Groundhogs Day. I always forget it. I mean, I’m able to remember when it’s Boxing Day, and not Groundhogs Day. Sadly, I didn’t realize it was Groundhogs day until 2. Very sad. Well, I hope my Groundhogs Day will be as half as good as yours will be.   Since it’s Groundhogs Day, I’ll try to make the effort of watching the Bill Murray movie “Groundhogs Day.” Maybe that will brighten my day.
