I keep pricing and talking and pricing and waiting for my miracle LOL. But hey, who knows when this time may come.   Well, to tell you the truth I have lots of things I want but do I necessarily need them no. I have however, driven a 1992 Buick LeSabre for like the last 5 years if not more. I have only had one true cool car and I was 16 when I had it; I am due damn it! I guess I'm just tired of driving my car around with the head liner floppin in the wind all while my radio crackles cause it doesn't work; the paint is chipping and it's full of 2000 door dings. Meanwhile the check engine light on then off then on then off as well as the anti-lock brake light and now the regular brake light dings at me. I mean how fricking white trashy can I get? All I need now are some bumper stickers and a black Def Leopard T-shirt and I have it made.   I do have the knowledge that I want too much however; and I need to get my priorities straight.. but living in this instant gratification society it's hard not to go right out and but whatever the flip I want.
