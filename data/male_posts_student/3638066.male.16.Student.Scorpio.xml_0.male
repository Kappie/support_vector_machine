We basically played Super Smash Bros. Melee and Soul Caliber 2 the whole day. Thursday, we went to Six Flags from 9AM to 10PM. We met up with the other people from Grant and it was fun. Seeing everybody, well not everybody, was fun but kind of weird because they have changed dramatically from the last time I saw them. Friday was a chill day and I'm happy I had that because if I didn't, I would be dead right now. Saturday, at 9AM, I had to go to Birmingham for the Cancer Walk thing. I feel bad that my mom had to donate 80 bucks just so I can get the 100 dollars for donations.. I hope I can pay that back to her somehow.. So then Saturday was crazy man. We had water fights, constantly really, walking, talking, beachball, volleyball, dancing on Jessica and Raul's part haha! Jeez how can they stand listening to (Jook Gal Remix and Culo!) for basically the whole night?! It was fun though.. Jessica is so pretty =)     SUNDAY   - We had kareoke and I was  so  ready to sing (Usher - U Got it Bad) OH MAN FUKIN MC man.. Right when I was supposed to go up, we were out of time. Bastards. Then we finally slept!!! OMG FINALLY SLEPT. It was around 2. BUT! Around 4:30, I woke back up because of people talking outside. And I looked around.. and nobody was around me. I was like WTF! Went back outside and found out everybody didn't sleep. I had 2:30 of sleep woot! Hehe. We went walking and talking and stuff till 4AM I think where me, Carli, and Jessika slept on the tables. Like when you sleep in class? We were sleeping like that since JESSICA had to go in her humongous tent with that guy she barely met lol. OMG I was so ready to sleep. Then I slept for 2 hours on the table then went into the tent with Raul and Stephanie. I wonder how we fit 4 people in that tiny tent!! Me, Raul, Jessika, and Stephanie.. oh man that was crazy  LOL!  Woke up at about 8:45 and we went to the ending ceremony. Waste of time but we got Icee's so that was okay. We took our last lap and we took pictures. I took a picture with the humongous panda! LOL! Retarded panda lmao. Then we all left and Shirley drove me home. Thank you Shirley!! Took a shower.. then rested for a bit. At 12:30, Yulan picked me up and we went to KFC and went to Northridge. OMG no time to rest! We spent a lot of time at the Sam Goody playing video games and the Apple Store going online for free LOL. I bought 2 pretzels form Auntie Anne's and that was  goooooooooooooooooood..  I want more! Then went over to Yulan's house and we watch the Kenshin movie and another Jackie Chan movie. And Orianna taught me how to make a turtle! It was cool hehe. Then went back home and went online for a bit and downloaded CULO!  LOL!  Then sleep comforted me.. And now concludes my humongous blog. I left out so many details. I'll show pictures later.. peace
