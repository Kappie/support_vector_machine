I'm sure my crazy antics of my everday life will either lead to something funny happening or personal injury, trust me, you will know if either happens - expect that in a few hours - lol 3. I'm starting up a security analysis company, so if you want me to scan your computer for security flaws, talk to me within the next week, because after that, I'm going to start charging people - ah yes, another benefit of being a hacker, you will never get hacked into! 4. I'm ordering up another supply of BLACK BLACK. therefore my posts should get a lot crazier 5. I'm begining to like someone, and no, it is not randomperson1. for now, this person will be randomperson2. 6. *pathetic*I may not have children in the future, because to this day I have gotten hit 3, almost 4 times.    DAMN YOU ALEC ORTMANNS! Speaking of which, I've gotten a pretty funny story about that kid. HEHE, I think I will save that for my next post!  later, bradleyJ
