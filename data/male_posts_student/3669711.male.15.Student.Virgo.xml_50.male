I'm not going to bother giving my inturpretation because whenever i did, it just sounded to weird, so i got this from  urlLink Animenfo .     Mizuho Kazami, a beautiful young woman, went to a high school in mountainous area to teach Japanese. However, she is actually a representative from galaxy association on her mission to observe earth. Accidentally, Kei Kusanagi, one of her student, discovered her true identity. In order to keep it secret, Mizuho Kazami married Kei Kusanagi and they both live together secretly. Can they keep their marriage from Kei's classmates?  Well, that about sums it all up, to see if they do keep their marriage from Kei's classmates, you will have to buy or download this series and watch it for yourself.  No spoilers in this rant.   Now, when i first started watching, i was quite surprised.  First of all, this series was not ecchi, as i had been told... well, not very ecchi.  There were a few odd moments, but nothing really serious.  It didn't take away too much from the story, except for the ova, and i will talk later on that matter.  Secondly, practically none of the characters from Onegai Twins were even mentioned in this series.  I was expecting a little more of a story flow.   On to my analysis.  Anamation - Top notch, very beautiful colours, funny facial expressions at some times.  The files that i downloaded had dual language, so i tried both.  I must say that the english was really bad.  The actors were trying way to hard to add emphasis, and their voices didn't really match the characters.  On the other hand, the japanese was excellent.  The music, meh, wasn't memorable.  I don't think i'll go to the trouble of looking for a OST.  One thing that was really good was the story.  They had subtle romance items in it that kept me going... it was really quite beautiful.  I would give this a 9/10.   Now, on to the OVA.  I was quite dissapointed by this.  First of all, it was EXTREMELY ecchi... i don't think it added anything to the story.  Not to the point of seeing "anything" but still, what was implied was pretty bad.  Next, the ending of it added more questions that needed to be answered about the couple.  Did his classmates ever frigure it out?  Was Herikawa going out with Yamada?  Uwah... so many more questions that needed to be answered.  I didn't like it much, so i'll only give it a 5/10.   Over all, i really enjoyed it.  I don't think this series would be for everyone, like Azumanga Daioh is, IMO.   In other news, i got episodes 2.5 and 3 of Nurse Komugi-Chan Magikarte last night ^_^.  I've been looking for these for a while!  Episode 2.5 was sort of weird... it didn't follow along with the story line... and there was a lot of singing.  I haven't seen episode 3 yet... i hope thats better ^_^.   Lates
