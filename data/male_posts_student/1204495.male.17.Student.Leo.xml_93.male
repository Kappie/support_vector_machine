I have no idea what to do nowadays, maybe i should just not speak to her, forget about her, prehaps i should just concentrate on college work, seems like a good idea, take my mind of her, but hmm feels like shes been avoiding me for the past 2days, ah well, what was i meant to expect?! her to fall willing at my feet, nah tis not it, i guess i should just carry on making those pointless films i always seem to end up making, i mean michael started a convo asking me if i had made any more films, so i;m guessing that he thinks they're funny, *shrugs shoulders* prehaps i should just busy myself with friends porblems *nods head*  yes thats what i'll do
