Anyways, Bobert threw another unexpected, yet amazing party to which everyone and their mother came to. One thing that totally sucks is when you dont have any money to drink and everyone has a beer in their hand and is having a good time... does this mean i rely on drugs and alcohol to much to have a good time (I hope not). Chris tried to prostitute his room in order to make profit off of overly-horny teenagers, NOT A BAD IDEA!! And another thing about not having money it makes it really hard to gamble...but thanks to some generous people i was able to get in on the action and got up pretty high. However i always give into Reza when I've taken him for alot of his money and he still wants to go... then i end up losing way too much and supporting not only his gambling addiction but his Stillettos addiction as well (your welcome Reza....enjoy). I cant wait till next weekend after i save up all my lunch money and can party hard and maybe go on a "trip" via some kind of vegetables. lol JK (or am I). Got school tomorrow and I'm goign to have to chill with my impulsive outbursts or I'm going to be kicked out of Physics by Luft... Oh well, I'll have another lunch period and an easy class. And I would take my remaining time to congradulate Katie and Darin on being accepted to colleges. Later all you smutty people...
