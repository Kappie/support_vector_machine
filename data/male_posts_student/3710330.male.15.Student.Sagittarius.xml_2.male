I woke up at 12pm (Not a very healthy option), and rushed to take my lunch of the usage vegetables and "Sunny Side up" with an extra dish of fresh fried fish, and hurry off for another lesson at my Chinese tutor's house. My Dad couldn't fetch me as he had to meet up with a client at Jurong.  Sat through the whole long one hour journey of the train ride, trying my best to absorb the words in the newspaper that seemed ubiquitous and constantly repeating itself. After admitting defeat my attempt, due to a dearth in concentration and the constant rocking of the train, I decided to reduce myself to just staring blankly at the continuous advertisements on the Mini television on board the North East Line(NEL).  Feeling triumphant about myself for being able to survive the terrifying Nel, I sauntered towards my tutor's house but no soon did I suddenly  realise the ordeal that I was about to face, I started getting all tensed up and readied myself for the battle at the frontlines.  Tuition ended with me feeling all exhausted and bleary eyed, with the words "NI YI DING BU HUI JI GE" my tutor had said, pontificating at the difficulty of me scoring well in the Chinese"O" exams, constantly ringing through my mind. How encouraging, I kept saying to myself father picked me up from her house and we went to a hawker centre to take our dinner.  The cornucopia of food at the hawker centre often attracted me to take my meals there. Food ranging from Chicken rice to Hae Mee to Nasi Lemak, simply made me my senses go wild. I settled down on a plate of Char Kuey Tiao, which came on steaming on a banana leaf, supported by a plastic plate. My father chose to devour a plate of Char Siew rice. We both ate heartily and then we drove home with an order of a fish fillet burger from the Macdonald's fast food restaurant for my sister.  When we reached home, we found out to our dismay, that my mother had just arrived home. She wasn't too happy with us not buying any food for her and my sis and dad had a bout over who should take over the responsibility of the problem. Fortunately, I mother mitigated the problem by reducing herself to eating overnight dumpling. Then it was a time of family-get-together-at-the-TV or in a  nutshell, four people goggle-eyed at the television.
