Anyway, I had an idea spawned by Dave's previous post, which was this: What is the greatest song in the world?   Place your comments now!  Also, It won't let me comment on dear Bri-y's post below, so I'll just edit this post to include it: How dare you? I am not stupid. My mind runs just as quickly as anyone elses, although sometimes in the opposite direction. Thank you.   Commenting's fine now ~Dave
