New layout, new colors, old material. Archives are evidently placed to your right, as well as links. Colored alternatives can be located at the lower pole of this blog. Profile also to your right. Keep you arms, legs, and any other appendages inside the computer, and shut that fucking cell phone off.  Many people are gone for a little while. Elise has departed for Japan. Both Amber and Elizabeth are gone, but will be back by Friday, when we shall have a fun-filled day. I hope.  Birthday in twelve days.  I tutored this morning in Algebra, and recieved forty dollars for it. My student said he had a far more thorough understanding with my assistance. I need that money. I have yet to find an occupation. Unemployment sucks.  Redid my entire room. A far more comfortable location now. Cheers.
