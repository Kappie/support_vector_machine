MEOW! i can't wait to have fun! i reached woodlands MRT control station punctually .. at 7.30 am sharp ( the meeting time) hahhaha i saw the whole groups of st john kids siting there as though waiting for their "mother" , which is hui ting.   argh! MY TUMMY cried for food!.. so i comb my bag for that pethectic coupon! god!haha i bought a turkey saugsage burger meal! YUMMY!  but no eating in mrt statioN! stupid rule! but i stil share with the kids! so gald to see them !  but 1 major problem! !!!!! SOS ! our dear "little" ze ling is missing in actioN! he was late ~! where is he? no one got his number!ai yo!  so mdm hui ting decided to wait for him while i bring the rest of the kids to red hill! ARG!  i hate that location! its the place where i have my 2 years of IDOIT NCO camp there! EEEEEEEE - bukit merah secondary school! YAK!  hahhaha phobia.... we have fun  on our journey there! was it total fun all the way? yes? no ?.... NO there was a time bomb news... waiting to explode. the timer tick slowly as time passed... that news was abt to explode. GOD ! i should have just stay at home so that i will not be BOMBed by that time bomb!...( funnny language hor) hahha  NOT FUNNY!   :( :( :( ... time passes slowly... and we are still smiling... wow. we reached the RED hill station - finaly. the air was ever pure and seems so welcoming... ... HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM so refreshing. i just want to have more of this!!! come breeze .. come to me !  " YH! i tell u somthing hor..... yesterday i didn't really sleep la.. but i was talking to someone.." said pig.   ************************************************************************************  TIPS: yesterday i called gavin to ask him abt some contacts of the people. eg hui ting. coz my hp spoil and thus i lost al their HP number. but he told mi he wanted to sleep. and didn't give mi ani contact... to mi the contacts was urgent .. in case today i was late.. at least i can contact hui ting MA!....... *************************************************************************************  " WHO!?" i raised my eyebrown.. expected him to tell mi that it was " U KNOW WHO" "who? say la.... was it her?" i said cheeckily! " it was a SHE , but not her.." he answered just as i was abt toguess which gal was it he said anxoulsly  "... its JIN LI mdm"  WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  no number of EXCLAIMATION MARKS can express my feeling!!!!   the air is making mi PUKE! somany CARBON MONOXIDE !! I CAN"T BREATH! the air is so unpure now! it is so UNWELCOMING PLACE! going to BUKIT MERAH is always BAD LUCK FOR MI! POI!  i mean on one hand , i was sad in the sense that i was disappointed. as he choiced to talk to others instead of giving me the urgent contacts. on the other hand.. it was JINLI! ai yo! i dun hate that person .. but was so call.. scare of her for once.. she ACCUSE mi of saying bad things abt her school ( green ridge)during a competition.. which i dun really remember and even if i do.... it wasn't on intention... and EVEN *if it was....( i didn't and it wasn't)  i didn't spread or shout out my comments to everyone..i was just having a leasuire converstion with my seniors! hai~!  i was to let by gone be by gone.... but .... the way hui shi and jacklynn told mi abt her was awful... they say " ORH!!!! U CHEM LIAO!! U "DE ZUI" her" ...... it sounds as though it was a hellish mistake!   BACK TO PIG!  .... i was angry! very ! very.. not so much(30%) because he talk to him but (70%) because he choose to talk on phone and refuse to give mi an urgent thingy! AI YA! I DUNNO LA! very siao now! now in the right mood! MOO MEOW!   i refuse to talk to him for the whole day.. till now loz... i even refuse to have direct eye contact with him.. i m pure angry! ARGH! ... luckily got hui ting beside mi to talk to mi.. to distract my attention. .hai~! ... the scar is still there even if u are not looking at it.....   just as i guessed... he was the duplicate of mi.... just like photocopy....( maybe for him.. his ink is too much. so balcker than mine) ... if u didn't talk to him.. he won't talk to u .... thats our policy.. i always agree on that theory .. but i always hate it when it is happening to mi! somtimes i really can understand how helpless jacklynn  get when i do that to her... KARMA!!!! KARMA !!!! now pig is doing this to mi.. hai~!....  . aniway.... the SANA course is doing well.. everyone in the hall pass.... and our JANET CHAI got the highest mark!!! SO PROUD OF HER!!! MEOW MEOW !!!!! congrates!  on the way home.... i didn't talk to him .... maybe we were waiting for each other to take the initaitive to start the topic.. but none of us do.. PARALLEL LINES DUN MEET!  but in the MRT.. i realised that for a long moment .... pig was alone..guess he was having problem with his grp of friends..... if the time bomb didn't explode ( in simple eng for gavin's sake coz i know he won't be ab;e to understand ...... if we didn't have conflict in the morning..) i would have gone there... the angel in my head is telling GO! but the  devil in my head is telling mi NO! ... i choose the devil! so sorry!....  well.. thanks hui ting again .. she was siting beside mi accompanying mi.. iw as more fortunate in the sense that hui ting was there for mi..( but 3/4 of the time i was sleeping)   but gavin was alone!  how? i m worry too!  but wat can i do?  i m a stupid fooL!  ... hai~!..... luckily i think when the train reached woodland... pig was perfectly fine with the rest.... if i'm not worng i saw them walking towards mac for lunch ? hahah i think so ba.... HUI TING wanted to go stamps in civic.. and iwantedt o go library to study... wow.. she finally agreed to accopany mi .. for 1 hour.. hahah its better than not.. haha wow! then outside the civic sentre.. we saw ZELING... moo!! he was again.. alone... watching the free sample show displayed outside.. hahaha we stood beside him.. so near that i can ever felt his sweat.. but he didn't realise that i was there.. then i sneezed..... 3 times... * it must be pig that was scolding mi .. i thnk so.. but after that.. abt 10 min or so.. he finally regconise us..... i gave him a can of coke light.... coz i can't finish it... ( dun worry .. its new cann la)_ ahaha   we went to library and sat beside a lady... we do our own stuff.. and hui ting ... as planned..... went off an hour later... THANKS ALOT! meow! hmm... i finished my MAS SPECTROMRTER notes and half of APGP.. then my stomach feel so... so so so hungry again.. so i wnet home .. god@ mum bought a huge packet of NASI BRUaNI....... so full now.. god! i m going to be fat...  oh yes.. in the library ., i sms gavin lots of time.. guess he is sleeping.. but ican't somfirm.. he might be angry with mi.. i apologoise to him ... lots of time.. hai~!..  so now here i m typing the story of my journey to bukit merah! then gavin finally reply!!!!!

BULL SHIT! its just a stupid useless character of mine... i m a nobody..  no one to him (or at least thats wat i think) ... ya.. maybe he was right . for once...  i shouldn't control him.. i actually made the same mistake that jacklynn did to mi.... hai~!.... i'm a mirror of her.... pig, dun follow my footstep ! never! just stop right there and find ur own footstep..  i told him i will not bother him in the futeure animore.. i was very depress when is ay that....... i know it will be hard on us. but its the best way for mi not to hurt him animore..   he replied ..wads the problem? can u tell mi wats happening tou ? wat dun bother with mi in the future anymore?  do u know how those words can hurt others mah?  .. ya he was right! mmmmm i was .. once agin hurting him... but i hope this is the last and final times!   yea.... i know how much it hurts him.. as it hurts mi just as much.... i really care abt him..... more than my own blood brother... i dunno la........ give mi sometime.. i maynot be in the right stead of mind now.. sorry if there is anithing ... sorry!!!!!!!!  good night blog.. its a long and teary day today !hope tomorrow is better.... right bro pig?  love, yit hann   * ps.... thanks Xiao chuan for helping mi to register the blog.. coz i m a newbi here... hahha  look at the comment !!!
