I am slightly confused at times by Icelandic-English, but I believe not as confused as you would be by my English-Icelandic, so we'll stick to English as a medium of conversation, I guess (until we all master Icelandic). It might be tough for Lars, Magnus, Vegard, et al. to give up their "primitive" tongues and learn Icelandic though (haha). Well, believe it or not, I hung out with an Icelandic girl last night. Yes, there are more than 2 of them. I couldn't get enough of Iceland, what with the sheep cheek and dried fish, so boy was I glad to find out my friend is dating a girl who grew up in Iceland until age 16. We shot the shit about all things Icelandic, from that crazy non-alcoholic malt stuff (child's play) to Thule. I exhausted her knowledge of Iceland in about 5 minutes, so I proceeded to teach her all the things Ulli (sorry I have no accent mark ` key) taught me about Iceland and life in general. So in other words, the conversation continued another week :)  Ulli prepared me well to educate her about her own country.   So, I've got my fingers crossed that this e-mail will actually send and I will not lose everything I've hitherto typed. You see, I'm still using the old dial-up modem, yeah the one from the 90s, and it's not the most reliable. George W. is off playing with laser-guided Smart bombs somewhere, and I can't even get a freakin cable modem. Blame my tightwad parents for that one, I suppose. Oh well, back to school in a few weeks. Then it's back to real studying and real classes. No more ESADE Leadership, where the essence of the course is "do whatever you want and tell us that you learned something in the end." As this is my first blogging experience, I should probably cut it short lest I become burnt out at a young age.   Tim
