Since the movie only cost around $75 million to make, I think it's safe to say that Universal will have writers hard at work to draft a script good enough to get Matt Damon back for a third installment. Yup, you heard me right - I'm calling it.  Let's look at this: "the Bourne Identity" cost about $45 million to make, and raked in over $110 million worldwide, not including DVD sales/rentals. "the Bourne Supremacy" cost $75 million to make, and in its first weekend  alone , it made back two-thirds of the total cost - and it hasn't gone worldwide or sold/rented any DVDs yet! This movie should make close to $200 million, making it simply stupid if Universal can't get a script done for a third installment in this franchise.  But here's the catch: Damon has said, as I mentioned before, that he won't make a sequel just to make money. (Which is the right attitude.) He'll only do another film if the script equals or exceeds the previous film(s). You can bet Universal is going to have writers working off their butts to get him back; if they don't, it won't be because the movie was bad or didn't make money - it'll be because Universal failed to turn out a good script.
