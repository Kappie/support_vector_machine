I call and it records a message that is posted on the site.   Now of course for my regularly schedualed rant about my life.... [music: The Weakerthans - Plea From a Cat Named Virtue] [book: The Bible - Genisis (it's for school)]  What a lazy day today. It was awesome. As Ray was saying, it is great to be able to do something and not have school hanging over my head. I still have violin but that I can handle that (no I can't) yay for lazy days Now to just get my ass away from the computer
