Drink from the company toilet Eat too many free cookies and vomit on the interviewer's shoes Fart Grope the recruiter Hire a doppelganger to pretend to be you Iron your shirt while you're wearing it Jump out the 33rd-floor window Kick the interviewer.  Hard. Lie about your criminal record Murder someone Never look him in the eye Open your fly Poison the interviewer's coffee Quit -- even before getting the offer Respond to all questions only with hand signals Show up naked Take your shoes off during the interviewer Use lots of curse words Vomit (see E, above) Wash your tie -- ties don't like that (lesson learned) X-ray your chest, and give the interviewer a copy when he asks for the resume (I'm stretching) Yodel Zip your fly.  Or don't.
