One: A totally awesome-looking movie can turn out to be mediocre. And two: everyone in Transylvania is a trapeze artist. Seriously, this movie should be more aptly titled. I suggest “Rope Swinger,” or “Van Helsing and the Amazing Appearing Ropes.” This movie is almost overwhelmingly drenched in cheesy scenes where one of our characters swings across a great expanse on a rope while the music swells to indicate adventure. Adventure? What’s so amazing? Apparently, everyone in the country is quite skilled at swinging on ropes. And there seems to be a constant supply of conveniently placed rope everywhere in Transylvania.   But enough about ropes, you’ll get your fill if you see the movie. Van Helsing is entertaining, despite the rope acrobatics. The special effects are very well done and they blend almost seamlessly with the live-action. And speaking of action, the fights are also very good. Van Helsing battles such legendary creatures as Mr. Hyde, the Wolfman, and Dracula.   However, it’s a bit confusing and mind-boggling how and why these creatures all came together. I know there was something about a plot Dracula had for bringing his children to life, and he needed Frankenstein for some reason to do so. It seems as though the weak writing in this film was further weakened and overshadowed by the special effects and fight scenes.   And that’s exactly what Van Helsing is. It’s nothing but a brief, entertaining, special effects thrill ride. There is no compelling story or memorable characters. There really is no scenes that stick out in my mind, either. Van Helsing is by no means a bad movie, but it’s not a very good one either. See it once, enjoy it for what it is, and forget about it.
