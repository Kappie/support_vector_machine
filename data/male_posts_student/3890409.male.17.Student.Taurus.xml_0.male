I managed to get at least eight hours I think, which is pretty good for me.  Today I went swimming in the neighbor's pool, so that was refreshing. Considering that it feels like it's about 32 Degrees out right now.  As for right at the moment, I'm kind of just relaxing in my room. I might decide to watch a movie. I'm not sure though, sounds a little boring.  I'm hoping to get back into Sports again.....correctiom...I NEED to get back into Sports again, 'cause I'm pretty out of shape at the moment, and I need to do something competitively, just for the thrill. I love it.  I'm done for now, nothing more to tell. I'll be back in a couple of days with another update.
