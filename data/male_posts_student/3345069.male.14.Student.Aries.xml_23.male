But basically a man in Oslo, Norway walked into a McDonalds, dressed as Ronald McDonald and started yelling about how he disapproved of McDonalds policies. He was asked to leave, he refused. He was then arrested in front of all of the people eating there which included children. Its a sad world we live in, I mean someone tried to impersonate a clown. I think that's as low as you can go. But it made for a funny story. LOL
