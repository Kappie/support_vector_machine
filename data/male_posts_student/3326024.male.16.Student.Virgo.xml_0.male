Being gone for the past two days doing things with people I know, yet it feels like I did nothing at all. Well anyways, I am sitting here listening to some Jefferson Airplane with a bad headcold, trying to enjoy my last day of freedom before school begins again tomorrow. My teeth feel really weird too, but that may be from a mixture of smoking and alcohol but who knows. I am slowly coming to the realization that I am jerk, but only when I am with people I know. In my opinion this is because I am not afraid to tell them my thoughts about them, which may come off as me being mean to them. The truth hurts I guess. Well maybe I am not a jerk, I just tell it how it is, which makes it seem that way. For now I will leave you with my most eventfull happening this weekend, set on a friday afternoon...  School was boring and pointless. I really should have either stayed home or just skipped my classes and gone to other teachers classes. The latter probably would have been the best, more fun I presume. But I just went to my classes, and of course did nothing. The weekend finally arrived and I met up with friends after school. We do this every friday, nothing ever changes, I am going to start doing more, going places and seeing things. But anyways we made a call, and got a connection to Mr. Green. After a good session, we traveled to Tanasbourne to look at things. That is as far as I can get my friends to go, they would rather just lay around a house all day and do nothing, get fat, whatever, as long as I'm there we are gonna be doing something. The border I get the more truth I speak to them which they prefer not to hear. Well anyways, after that we got together with a friend of ours, Ben, and traveled to his house. In a strange encounter, we met his parents. One of which is a German import on a work visa, who took the liberty to offer us his finest German beer. I must say that it was quite good. My friends aren't much of beer drinkers though, except for Ben. Decent conversation continued, nothing spectacular or worth mentioning. After that I presented a joint to my partners, in which they could not refuse, so we formed a circle and quickly the crayon sized J was nothing but a little roach. I then took the short ride home from my frined Tom, the whole way afraid of certain disaster, a possible wreck or pig encounter, but we made our way back home safely. Marching straight to room, I told my mother good night, and found sleep almost before I hit the comfort of my bed.
