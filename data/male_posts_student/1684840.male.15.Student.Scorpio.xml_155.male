The mornings' lessons have been great because more than half of the year have been out on a crappy Army trip that we didn't give a darn about.  I completed cube number 2 twice and Mrs. Lawley called me a genius    ICT Shortcourse was kinda boring, followed by a boring session of Geography in the library and an interesting lesson of Chemistry with Mr. Pooley.  We did Electrolysis and to be honest, I understood him a lot more that Mrs. Bond.  I smelt the Electrolysing Hydrochloric acid and it smelt like the swimming baths
