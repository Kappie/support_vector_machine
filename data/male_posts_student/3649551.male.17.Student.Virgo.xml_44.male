I'm awaiting my second rejection at her hands. You know, that's really my problem when it comes to wooing. I have absolutely no confidence in my chances of success. Whenever I've decided to try and start a romantic relationship, I've honestly never believed it would happen. I have self-esteem issues in this area. I think that maybe if I believed I'm good enough, she would believe that, too. But somehow, I can never think positively about these things. Whether or not I should think this, I don't think it will happen. There's just something about me that makes it impossible for girls to see me in THAT way. I always end up in the friend role, and then eventually I'm shafted altogether. But you know what, I'm probably a stronger person for it. At least I do stick my neck out. At least I care enough to risk getting my heart torn out. At least I have the strength to make myself vulnerable in the future, knowing full well the kind of pain I'm likely to experience. I think I'd rather experience the turmoil of rejection than the uncertainty and regret of never having tried. And besides, there are a LOT more painful things than teenage romance, or a lack thereof. I have such an easy life it makes me sick. I'm very thankful that this is the worst pain I'll be experiencing at this point in time. Because it's not that bad. I'm still awaiting a phone call that isn't likely to come tonight. I'll know whenever that accursed cell phone rings. The news isn't likely to be good. Bring it on.
