I'm goin to the movies tonight with Ashley, Daniel, and Lauryn. Well... maybe. The only one of the four of us that has already asked their parents is Lauryn. So, me, daniel, or ashley might not be able to go. CRAP. I was sposed to clean my room yesterday so when i asked my mom if i could go to the movies, she would be cool with it, but cynthia and her friend paulina (friend from canyon) came over, i got sidetracked and ended up not cleaning. now i have to clean my room today >.
