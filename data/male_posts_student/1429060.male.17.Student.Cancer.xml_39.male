I feared that the giggle resulted from my ignorance or something of that nature, but Lauren Henry and Brock ( urlLink  Bat Lord ) assured me that it resulted from my packing loads of information into a few minutes at very high speeds. My tongue is sore.  And forgive me for all the lord/vampire/supernatural shit. I am feeling like that. I think I shall make a list of what everyone would be if they were some supernatural being.  Cheers.
