I sat in my coffee shop, smoked my ciggarettes, and read the March edition of Vogue(lovely spring modes by the way) knowing that i was the best dressed person in the room...though it is in the dinkydome and i was surrounded by students so that is not saying much. poopie butt...i am a smoker again...
