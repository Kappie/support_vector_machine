It's such a small world, didn't know he is my dance instructor's friend until I found out that he gotten the Path Fiesta whole family photo (Quan Jia Fu) in his blog. I know my han yi pin yin not that good, but at least I could spell. Hehe, afterall my mandarin is not that bad. To be frank, I realised his blog to be either too long-winded or too short. Kind of unbalance, anyway I am too lazy to read everything on his blog. (Actually I am jealous of his English)       That's the family photo Keito stolen to put in his blog.    It's late now and why am I still staying awake. Because I am too scared to sleep, I watched "Resident Evil" at 10. Followed by watching "Huanting over America" half-way through because it was too frightening for a innocent kid like me. So I browsed throught other channels and stopped at Kids Central. Opps, there's no Kids Central at night. It should be Art Central, it was showing a Japanese cartoon. In the scene, I saw many guys covered in all white suits grabbing the struggling girl trying to escape. Then I don't know how did the girl suddenly got so much strength to resist and managed to free herself. So she ran at a fast speed and knock her head against the wall. During that time, question marks (??? -_- ???) were all over my head. I thought to myself, why is this girl so stupid? Is she dumb or nutcase? Or perhaps that's an accident, she ran so fast that she couldn't break in time.   If that's commit-suicide, it's a very interesting method to die. Normally in any drama or movie, the person will just stand in front of the wall and bump his head against the wall several times. Back here, the guy declared that this girl broke a record of shuttle run if I am not wrong with the timing of 7.1 secs if I am not wrong again. I think she also broke the record of being the first person to die athletically in such an amazing way.  Ok that's only just a cartoon and cartoon can die anyway they want. Enough of that crap, it's Saturday now and I still have not completed my school project. Time flies. Why does time flies and not crawls? Time always flies when I am having fun and crawls when I am bored. I am addicted to blogging and I spent more time blogging than my project. My deadline for the proposal is over, and the next deadline for my Flash project is next Tuesday.   I am going to do a shuttle-run and crash my head against the monitor. *Ouch* It hurts! *Fainted nicely onto the bed with head laying on the pillow and arms hugging the bolster*
