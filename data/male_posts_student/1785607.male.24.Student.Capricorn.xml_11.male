I know I started this blog in a totally different direction that the one is taking... I tried at the beginning just to explain my life, to explain the way I think and now I got caught in the natural dramedy of a relationship. For example, today, I'm here, at home, alone, aching for him... but when we are together, I just think how good I feel, but how awkward it is for me to be with a guy... specially when it comes to think in my family and friends...  I've lied, to friends and family... this closet case is not a nice thing to live.. but I am so afraid though... I thought that I was ok with my situation ( all before I met him ) but is not nice at all to do stuff and hide it all from the ones you care, specially when is something that makes you feel alive again with someone you start to love...   I'm proud of what I am. If someone asks me I'd tell. Is not like I am this big mystery, now, the problem for me is that I've built this friendships on the basis of, well, not  a lie, but a secret... and that's what scares me. What would they feel for me now if they known the truth about me.  Well, he is not here. I'm here alone; with all this thoughts and not knowing what to do... I even feel lonely. All of a sudden I blocked myself from everyone else that is not him... and I don't want to do that... Today he told me that he would be gone till tomorrow, anyway, I didn't make plans in hope that maybe ( and I knew it was a long shoot ) he would come today... I'm not blaming him for me being alone today, he told me about this trip a week ago, still, I want to be able to hang with him, and at the same time being free to feel secure enough of hanging with everyone else that matters to me and they knowing him, and accepting him for what he represents in my life now... But, another question: what does he represents in my life? A partner? A friend? Maybe is too soon to know, and maybe I'm just too worried about it, and maybe I shouldn't be writing about this at all, I could even scare him... Am I making too much of a deal ? aaaaggghhh... !!!! This is so hard.. If it were just me, that way I'd knew what's going on.. but in the matters of two, I could only know half of what's going on...  See how I go from being ready to come out to some friends to, where does my relationship goes...! I worry to much... Thank God we haven't had sex, I could be dying of jealousy by now. That's it...!!! I am jealous... could it be? So soon? ... Fuck, I'm a freak... that's what's been bothering me... I am jealous... fuck, fuck, fuck... damn it... I hate myself...   Well, as I know you'll read this latter in the week..   SORRY...!!! just bear with me and don't freak out...! I told you, it's been a long time since I got a real relationship... Now that I have said it, I feel better.. yes I am jealous.. and it doesn't feel good, but now, I feel free, it's not making me feel blue anymore...! So dude, Love you... And I'll see you, when I see you...!!! Kisses...
