"My heart lies somewhere between perfection and dust.  And while my soul is a sight to behold, I shatter at the blink of an eye."   The Glass Rose is associated with perfection, beauty, and frailty.  It is governed by the goddess Aphrodite and its sign is the Looking Glass, or Tenuous Love.  As a Glass Rose, you have a beautiful soul and naturally attract people to you.  Love comes naturally to you, but it hardly ever lasts.
