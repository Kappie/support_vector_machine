We know some of you might be used to our old layout, but we think that once you are used to the new design you will agree that it is easier to navigate. We have tried to make the front-page make better use of the available screen space, as well as making the most accessed areas (for example the worldmap) easier and quicker to get to.  The layout of the manual has also been improved, and lots of new information has been added, including a few new sections for you to discover yourselves!  You will also be glad to know we have added an all new exclusive wallpaper to our extra files section, which has moved towards the bottom of the main menu.  Finally, Mozilla Firefox 0.9 users will be pleased to know that we have improved compatibility with that browser, so you will now be able to login to the secure section of the site with less hassle than before.
