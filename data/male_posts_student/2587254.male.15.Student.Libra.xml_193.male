Woke up at 1130 to get ready to volunteer. Got to Masonville around 12pmish or so.    So today I did the same thing as Tuesday. I counted books left out, counted people using computers, and added ticks for every person that came in and stuff. Today passed by a lot faster though, as I was trying to catapult myself out of the computer chair I was sitting on, and was also reading a HTML book to pass the time. The time passed by really slow from 1-2, since for some reason no one came to the library during that time. Things picked up after 2 though, with almost all the internet computers booked, and also some hick singing for the kids in the meeting room. So my shift ended at 3pm, and mom picked me up around 315ish. I took out the HTML book too, so I'll have something to refer to while designing my Tenmore page =). Also I have that Left Behind book to read still haha....so yeah I'm starting to use the library =P.    Got home around 330, and quickly grabbed a lot of cookies and began eating. Then sat on MSN for a bit, and then drummed for awhile. Afterwards, mom made dinner, and then I ate somethin' before heading to the UCC. I finally got my towel grip onto my baddy raquet, and it's actually pretty cool. It balanced out the weight more so it seems easier to move the raquet now. Bottom line, I like it haha. I also played another game of Hexic with Jenn, I think I won =P.    So I got to UCC around 630 or so. Josh and Lina were already there, but no sign of Gavin or Carmen. Not surprising, since Carmen is ALWAYS late and Gavin was getting a ride from her, so I thought no biggie they'll probably show up around 7 or so. Well in the end, after calling them, they showed up at 8, and then played until 9. So basically that was 5 bucks down the drain for each of them. Carmen not surprisingly didn't play that well, as it is basically her first time, so we taught her how to play a little bit, which kind of bombed since in the end we just played normally. I got a shot straight into her throat by accident hahaha, and then later on I'd hit Lina with the bird too. I know you don't have to tell me, I got super good aim =P. I would take the credit, but yeah accident for both haha. I was surprised too that I hit Carmen, I was using my left hand to play, and I'm horrible with it, since my right arm was getting kind of tired from playing so much baddy this week. I won most of my games today, and also there was this one girl who was playing with her dad that is REALLY good for her age *she's not even out of public school yet I think.* As Josh said, she's better than half the people in high school already. Anyways, got a lift from mom home, Lina also got a ride too.    Here I am now. Blogging. Just ate some more food, and yeah I'm probably going to read tonight, and then watch some late night shows maybe.    Later.
