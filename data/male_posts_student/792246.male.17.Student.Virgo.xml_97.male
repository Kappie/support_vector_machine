My entire high school career is fucked up the ass and I will never graduate.  I told Bret I had a crush on him. He will now be afraid of me forever.  My hair is pink. And Claudia gave me crayons.  I got in an accident. And now I write this with tears sobbing down knowing I have to face my father. My mother was horrible about it as is.  Gah.
