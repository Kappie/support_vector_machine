Usually because they now reside within this fragile thing, a "lifestyle" if i were bold enough to term it one; called normalcy.   Today is the day in which millions over the globe pack their Christmas Trees into their old, crumpled, torn, soft and mildewed, brown cardboard boxes. The time when they pack the fun and festivities away and return to life as they know it. (Mind you, I'm not one to use the word "life" likely, just as various other aquaintences of mine do with thier attempt to start a conversation disguised as the common and i mean COMMON enqiry of, "So Tim, how's Life".) Screw that. I'll probablly write about that tomorrow. So anyway, It's symbolism.  Ironic too due to the very fact that the warmth of Christmas is intended to last one through the year, hauling along with it, jargon like good will towards men and the like. Instead, for some, the glow's gone the very next day. Tragic.  Odd. If I had a choice, I'd live Christmas daily. I'd bet I'd live longer too. There's this guy in England who does (as in literally). I saw him on Guiness.   God bless his jolly soul.
