It's a little dull, but not boring. School's over and done, so that's a plus. I'm going to miss some people, going to be glad to escape others, and probably never going to talk to any of them ever again. That's just the way life works. People move away, or change e-mails, or change and never talk to you again. Say what you will, it always happens.  Other news includes the 10 day celebration of all things queer here in WVa. I had no idea anything was going on because gay pride stuff is never flamboyant. I only know because Mom grabbed a little booklet at  Chef Dan's  the other night before dinner. Some of the stuff looks cool, and I think I saw a poster in the window of  Ellen's Homemade Ice Cream  for what looks like a drag show. If anyone wants to go I'll try to keep the 19th open on my schedule of moving stuff. It's the night of the 19th at the WVSU Capital Center theatre on Summers Street. Tickets are $10 at the door.  So that's what new, and it isn't about me all that much. I guess being inside and packing and hanging out with the grandparents doesn't make for exciting blog life. But I'm having fun, and that's all that matters, right?
