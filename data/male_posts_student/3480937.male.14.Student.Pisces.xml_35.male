Too many stupid problems for me to take, i am fragile right now,if u want to kick me in the face,insult me,or whatever,do it now..i won't do anything.  a fake front ish all i need to get over the year,then at least it will be better..wish the year can end right now..i can't do it anymore,i can't help anyone, noone can help me either, nort even God.  I am sinking, right to the bellows of hell, no return, no remorse, no nothing, nort even a single breathe of life emitting, guess its over now.
