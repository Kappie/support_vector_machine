I planned to do maths (or rather, copy) during lesson, which turned out to be a good idea because the lesson was REALLY silly and boring. Those who did not turn up for Thinking Skills today (you know who you are), good job! You missed a really boring lesson today. The decision to do maths early in the morning turned out to be a good decision later in the day... After that, we proceeded for maths lecture. With some time in between, I managed to complete my maths. The lecture itself was a bit boring, so we skip to Java lecture, OK? Java was quite a hoot! The lecturer was a real joker. He certainly made Java interesting. We learnt applets today, which seemed quite easy. I handed up my work which I was supposed to hand up on Friday, if not for the fact that I lost my disk. Anyway, after Java, we went for lunch. Went to Food Junction. Had sweet sour fish and drank honeydew milk tea, which was a bit sweet. afterwards, we went to ELP for some of them to do Maths. I was bored so I went to buy a pack of Mentos. Then came Multimedia Computer. We learnt how to combine sounds using sound mixing software and we had a bit of fun. Mine was a little funny but compared to the others' creations, mine was nowhere close. After two hours of mixing around, we finally met our Judgement Day, Maths Tutorial. This was when we had to hand up our Maths Homework. To my surprised, almost the whole class didn't complete their homework, so we stayed back for an extra half an hour. The lecturer wasn't angry though. At 5.30, we finally headed for home.  If that had bored you, I'm sorry. I didn't know what to write today.   P.S.  Those visiting my blog, feel free to make any comments you wish. Don't be shy! I will really appreciate it. Thanks again for dropping by!
