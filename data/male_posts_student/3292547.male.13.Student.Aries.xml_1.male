That was my purpose, but I decided to stop by anywho.  I've started a new book. It turns out I finished Eragon the next day -Sunday- in the morning. The one I'm reading right now is  This Present Darkness   By:Frank Peretti . It's a relatively old book that was Copyright 1986.  I'm not sure if it's any good yet really. I'm only on page 73. I'll get back with you. I'm falling down trying to get 1 a day, but maybe every other day will work out better. See ya later.
