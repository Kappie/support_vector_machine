My cousin has a blog.........  urlLink here  She  will  make you think about your life in a new way......  And if not, then you can't sue me because I didn't  promise  anything, and this isn't a valid legal document recognized by the California law offices...  So piss off.......  "I hope everyone is having a decent summer," I would say.  And you would go on thinking, "I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE!!!!!!!  STOP IT!!!   STOP IT!!!!!!!!!  "  So fine, all I have to say now is filler, and I don't really care how your summer is.....  Just give me until my next post to cheer up and say, "Summer is great!!! Yay!!!!!"    Good night......
