Somehow uncomfortable in a way I can't put my finger on.  4:00 - Give up on sleep, decide to face the world on four hours of it. Get up, do dishes, eat brekfast, check some blogs read some history and some other books (Amazon delivered yesterday).  9:00-10:00 - Clean out 1/2 of the garage. Apparently this has something to do with the kitchen and new cabinets. Meh.  11:30 - Leave with dad for library to copy and turn in Costa Rica forms. Waste about a dollar on my inability to work a copy machine.  12:30 - Arrive at school with forms and copies in tow. Building services guy at door says school is closed till three, I can't even go to the mail room for a second. Go to movies and catch snippets of "Stepfod Wives" And "Day After" instead ("Stepford" is a great wry comedy).  3:00 - Arrive back at school, which is still totally deserted. Call Laura, who's also having a sucky day.  3:05 - Building services lady sneaks me in to school. Get to ride in elevator and turn in forms.  3:25 - Catch bus, call mom who tells me to get off at Rockshire and head down to the pool.  3:35 - Arrive at pool, told to wait an hour for practice to end. Decide this is a bad idea and walk home instead.   4:25 - Almost home, meet some kids selling lemonade for a quarter. Awesome and cheap.  4:30 - Arrive home. Eat and drink dinner.  It's raining. Rain is good. I wish I could be a raindrop, that'd be neat.
