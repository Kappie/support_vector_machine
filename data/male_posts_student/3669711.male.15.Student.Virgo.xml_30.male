This party was a bit shorter than the last one, only one night,  but we still did lots of stuff. First and foremost, we watched movies.  We started off with anger management (funny movie ^_^)  and then we  watched X2. After that came 50 First Dates (Adam Sandler is soooo  funny), and then came parts of Gladiator. We also watched Die Another  Day, just for fun. Later, we started to  watch Gothika, but that was  bizzare, and we just turned it off. Then we watched some parts of The  Last Samurai. Thats about all the movies that we watched.   We  also played some games, but not many, considering movies are  usuallymore relaxing and fun. I brough my PS2 with me, and we played  Crouching Tiger, and Beyond Good and Evil, and .hack//infection. All  great games, althought they are all single player. Fun fun  fun.      Well, that party was fun, but now i have to catch up on lost sleep.     Lates
