We ended up goofing around for a little while, looking at random stuff. This is very good, becuase I try to pick up on ideas for christmas. Mimi bought a little western-style shirt at Old Navy. I think it is totally cute and I bought some Steve Madden style shoes at Payless for like 19 bucks and they are all man-made materials. I love em.   It's just a rainy day. I read a letter from a hurting friend. I joined a gym and that is rad!
