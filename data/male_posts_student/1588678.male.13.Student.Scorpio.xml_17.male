So, I share my thoughts about Johnny Cash and Warren Zevon.  Johnny Cash was one of the most respected musicians of our time. From the beginning of his career to his last years, he continued to make music that would inspire so many musicians today. "American IV" shocked me in a way. I'm mean, he's a 73 year old guy who's lived a rough life and still makes awesome albums. He's inspired so many country musicians and even well known punk bands like Social Distortion.   Warren Zevon, too, was an important artist. For some reason, Warren Zevon reminded me of Frank Zappa. Whether you were touched by his amazing lyrics or you put on a smile while listening to songs like Excitible Boy, Warren Zevon had a way with music. Even during his illness he managed to put out an amazing album, "The Wind." This shows how stong the man really was.    This post is dedicated to Johnny Cash and Warren Zevon for their great contributions to music.     Johnny Cash (1932 - 2003)    Warren Zevon (1947 - 2003)
