I'm having a hard time resisting the temptation to buy Ben Folds' latest EP,   Super D  . It's on sale for pre-order at  urlLink www.attackedbyplastic.com . The first 500 ordered will be autographed. Why am I not ordering it? Because I promised my wife that I wouldn't. I wish I hadn't now. I'll be over it tomorrow. I wanted to complete my set (I have  Speed Graphic  and  Sunny 16  autographed), but I won't now. That sucks.    UPDATE: The autographed copies of   Super D   are out.
