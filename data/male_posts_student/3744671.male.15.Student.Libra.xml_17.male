Also, I might occasionally review a DVD Box Set too, which will follow the same format as movies, which I will explain below! I won't review audio CD's because obviously everyone's taste in music is different, but I may review a book, occasionally which will follow the movie ratings guide!    Movies:      I score movies on a scale of 1 to 5.   Here's the breakdown of those rankings...  1 = crap, avoid this film at all costs  2 = below average, possibly worth a rental  3 = average, no rush to see this film  4 = good, you won't go wrong with buying this one (if you have the same tastes as me LOL)  5 = awesome! A must see, must buy film!     Games:  I score games on a scale of 1 to 10.   Here's the breakdown... 0-4.5 = bad, possibly a rental at best! 5.0-6.5 = mediocre, usually a rental, occasionally a purchase if in bargain bin! 7.0-8.5 = good, a solid purchase or rental 9-10 = Great! A must have game!       ------------------  Thanks,  ~Brian M
