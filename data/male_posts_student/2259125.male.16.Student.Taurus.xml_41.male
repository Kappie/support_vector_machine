I don't know why you would want to read this unless you were terribly horribly bored beyond any reason.  I am not venting because I am angry, I just want someone to hear.   Sometime this week I was driving home from seeing Anchorman with people in my car, which was okay with my parents.  Turning on a Venneford, a residential street from highlands ranch park way. I slowed down to turn left and so that my friends could wave by  (bad decision I know) well my friend who is at least 10 seconds behind doesn’t notice that I have slowed down and runs taps the back of my car.  I pull off left and she right and I could go into a huge description of what happen from then but we will just say that that she hit me and I was not happy but told my parents and got yelled and her parents agreed to pay she even said that it was all her fault.  I talked with my parents and we yelled and then got sad and we cried and everything was better. Saturday I think I went to Red Robin and that was fun but nothing too exciting unfortunately since Jessica had left.  While leaving the parking lot my friend got really sick and threw up in the grass.  Kate from RI had to drive Jessamyn’s car home (Kate only has a permit) I had to lead her home the safe way and she was going about 35 which is smart but took a while.  I don’t remember the rest of Saturday. What has happened, going from Sunday, I set my alarm for church but being the smart person that I am, I hit the off button, well I finally woke up about 9:10 or so, which for those of you who don’t go to my church, it started at 9.  I run around a drive over and arrive maybe about 9:35 or so, (half way through the service) right when worship was ending.  I the next part was listening to a sermon by the seniors, which I applaud, but (and no offense) is not as good as an intern or pastor, and are not expected to be that good.  I continued by going to the mall and walking around for a while.  My feet began to hurt and since it was around 1:45 or so I wanted to go home because I was bored and was not doing anything productive (no offense to anyone at the mall I was very tired).  I continued to go home and ask my parents if I could not go on the canoeing trip and got talked into it.  Monday woke up and started off okay, was planning on running but that didn’t happen, got called by Kate, my friend from Rhode Island.  Went over to the park about 1 or 2 or so and I stayed there for a while before I decided that I just needed to go somewhere else.  So I rode my bike (my brother had taken the car) over to Phil Fisher’s house because I knew him and Kevin Berry were over there playing video games. Well they were down in the basement so I went over to the Lauren Pagnard’s house (2 houses down) to ask if I could borrow the phone and call Phil and make sure that Lauren knew that she was invited to the park with Kate.  (Note: this is the girl who the previous week hit the back bumper of my car.)  I came in and it was her mother she laughed and joked and I borrowed the phone and told Phil to open the door. So he comes up and opens the door and I play counterstrike with them for a while. I go home and get ready for Scouts that night, I have a meeting with the Canoe trip people and that goes well except I had a huge headache and I really didn’t want to be there. Turns out at scouts the leadership was gone so it was free night, naturally I left and went over to Walgreens because Monday nights Kate Meek from church works there so I buy cards for friends, 1 for a sick friend, Jessamyn and 2 for another friend Sara.  I stood there for a while and wrote encouraging notes. Got home, and did nothing productive.  Tuesday I wake up and want to go running again but I have to make sure Shane wakes up for work so I play video games all morning then my dad says write your mission letter so I don’t because I smart like that.  Later I want to go hang out with Kate and my dad gets angry (note* my dad gets angry very quickly)(note*my peeve is when people get angry very quickly) he had the right to say no but he didn’t, thank you.  I went over to the park and hung out with Kate and friends then we went down to Teresa’s house and I watched the first 15 minutes of School Of Rock but I went home at 9 because my dad had called and said that there was an emergency.  Naturally I was concerned so I came home promptly at 9 thinking it was my grandpa or something.  Well my dad was on the phone and so was my mom and they didn’t seemed to worried, then 15 minutes later they sat me down and asked everything that had happened during the accident (going back to the beginning) I was confused as to why they were asking again.  They had told me that an anonymous letter had come in the mail about the accident.  I told them the story about how I had switched in to the left lane on Broadway in front of her and slowed quickly to turn on to highlands ranch parkway and how I had sped up to 55 at the max just because were teenagers (stupid decision and I am never speeding or racing ever again) and then told them that I slowed back down and stopped at the left turn off of highlands ranch onto venneford and waited for a car so that I could go and she would have to wait that way we would not egg each other on and she would not follow to closely, I continued to slow down was I had turned and she didn’t notice and tapped the back of my car, causing some damage which she said was her fault and she was soooo sorry. Well back to my parents and the letter, the letter had come and said (from the point of view of a student in the car) it was all my fault and Kate’s fault for wanting to slow down and I should be ashamed and was a horrible friend and Christian for not taking the blame and making Lauren (the other driver) pay. (Note: my mom has a degree in psychology and is extremely good with people and understanding them, I take after my mother in this and we are extremely good and discerning, in fact I think it is one of my mom’s spiritual gifts, it is impossible to lie to her.  My family is one of psychologists and you don’t try to deceive us, especially not my mother.)  My parents and I had a very long discussion and I got more lecturing, we then wondered who might have sent the letter and I deemed that most people in the cars would be too shy or to lazy to send a letter and only certain people knew the info in the letter.  I had narrowed it down to Jessamyn, but my mom being the genius that she is knew Lauren very well, and Ms. Pagnard (her mother) and wondered whether it was Ms. Pagnard who had sent it in order that she would only have to pay half the cost.  I thought it back and forth (and you should see me and my mom do this, it is really quite amazing how we only using psychology to do this and my dad sits in the middle dumbfounded while we are like detectives.  We narrowed it down to Jessamyn, Ms. Pagnard, or Lauren telling Teresa and Teresa writing a note (which I don’t think was very plausible so I didn’t consider it).  I was extremely hurt if it was Jessamyn because I did not want her to think those things about me since we have been friends for 12 years almost and I value that friendship a lot.  Wednesday I went over to her house around 9 am (she was leaving at 10 to go to Utah for Jr. Olympics for her sister) I gave her the get well card and asked her in her honest opinion if she though the accident was my fault.  I realized that night before I went to bed that it wasn’t Jessamyn because I remember her supporting me and she doesn’t write in cursive and that was how the letter was addressed.  She very strongly said no that it was all Lauren’s fault and that legal it was her fault and that I should not have to pay, I ask about the letter and she said it was horrible and that she did not write it. So if it wasn’t Jessamyn that left one other person Mrs. Pagnard.  She had written a letter saying mean things about me and saying it was my fault and acting like she was a student so that she would only have to pay half the costs.  We are pretending like the letter was never sent and continuing with them paying for the damages.  I was personally offended, well I get back and my dad flips because he wants the letters finished and so I write them and address I still need to send them.  I finished them so I went to brunch with a friend and had a talk with that person but it wasn’t a very happy one because they don’t me that life sucked and they hated living and that they were cutting themselves and that the medication to bring them out of depression wasn’t working (they goes to a shrink). I tried to encourage them and get them involved with a church or something but I am still afraid. I then came home and worked on packing for my canoe trip which I had all my stuff together but it wasn’t packed enough for my dad so he started yelling at me.  I then asked if I could go to the mall with Sara and Sarah and there was more yelling at me. So I packed and slept and then my mom got home and I was still angry with my dad so she got angry at me.  More yelling and arguing.  I then ate dinner, which went well because Brent and Shane were home.  I then got online and was talking people and I accidentally angered a friend (note: I hate IM because I am a person who deciphers most of what is being said by voice inflection and body language, it is the psychology thing I was talking about earlier.)  Connor kept on calling and I was talking to him but so much was going on I couldn’t keep track and I was trying to get over to his house but I first wanted to work out the problem with this friend.  I didn’t quite know what to say at first and I felt like a kept on rambling on.  Finally I got the impression that we were okay and I had to go (yes I did get the last few sentences but had to leave) I was already late by 30 minutes for Connor’s, but things went better because Ryan was there and I hadn’t seen either of them in a while, and we watched Bourne Identity. The only problem is that I have had a headache since about the conversation with my friend and over IM and it was only getting worse, I was afraid that I might get a migraine and have to be picked up.  I was supposed to be home by 11 and didn’t get home till 11:40 or so because the movie ran over, luckily my parents really don’t notice when I get home as long as I check in.  I came home and checked the blog and received a very touching apology, which I accept humbly.  I am now helping my brother pack for his camping trip and just told him about the accident and he just gave me another lecture.  It is now 1:36 on Thursday, I have no idea what I am suppose to do with this writing, I have just been talking to my computer for about and 1 ½ hours.  Maybe I will post it. Hey I still need to get those 2 cards from Monday to Sara before I leave. Good night.
