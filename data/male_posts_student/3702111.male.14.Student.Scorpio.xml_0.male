I got there assuming I would run into Scott Boileau cuz he told me he was gonna meet me there at noon, of course he never showed up. Well it was probably better off he didn't show up cuz I ran into Leo Dehabey and chilled with him all day then I ran into Todd Jolley. When I first got to the J I benched a rep then did three sets of curls only to realize I totally didn't feel like liftin, so it became a cardio day, so me and Leo ran the treadmill then used the bikes. We then went upstairs to play some bball and got a game of 21 goin with these two black guys that had the most amazing ups I've ever seen. These guys were like 5'9 and they were dunkin and stuff, I felt so...white. Well I didn't do too bad, I scored 13, I'm gettin pretty good at bball considering I play every day. Well I was all tired and hott so we all went outside and scoped out the chicks. I swear the hottest chicks in Sylvania are members at the J, it was amazing, there were so many. Well we came home and my bro fell off of his bike and got pretty messed up, I wasnt sure how it happened but I felt bad it was like a freak accident. Well we ate dinner, then went to my bros baseball game. I saw Ashley Mcnair, and Mike Anderson there, and unfortunately, my brothers team showed Ashley's brothers team a real ass whoopin..It's ok, no hard feelings. Well now I'm home and plannin to go to the J tomorrow to hang out with Gabi..My one true love..Gabi..I love you all three of our daughter's names will be Gabi. Later Dudes
