We anaways, i was just at Sharper Image and i sat in the COOLEST chair ever. Like it was one of thoses that gives you a massage and wow did it feel nice. I must have sat therer for an hour, and now im trying to get my mom to buy it. SO yea on sarahs blog, she likes saying how i turned her dog gay. WEll thats just not so. I cant help it that her dogs penis becomes aroused when it comes into contact with males. What am i supposed to do?  THE countdown is official. 12 days till XMAS!!!!! gotta love it. DAVEY
