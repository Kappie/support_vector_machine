I could only say that I had a gut feeling that losing big was a lot worse than winning big, that if I had the choice between 1) staying where I (or rather, where my familiy was) was financially or 2) having 50% chance of either trebling my income or halving it, I would choose to stay where I am even though the second choice has a greater expected value. I've found an amazing article that articulates an impressive intellectual and evidence-rich argument for social insurance that is substantially beyond what we have today.   urlLink "False Positive"    by  Jacob S. Hacker, Ph.D.   Some highlights:    Plus, conservative paeans to social mobility miss an even more glaring problem: What goes up also goes down. And, for most Americans, downward mobility is far more painful than upward mobility is pleasurable. In the 1970s, the psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman gave a name to this bias--"loss aversion." Most people, it turns out, aren't just highly risk-averse--they prefer a bird in the hand to even a very good chance of two in the bush. They are also far more cautious when it comes to bad outcomes than when it comes to good outcomes of exactly the same magnitude. The search for economic security reflects a basic human desire to guard against losing what one already has.  Judged on this basis, what my evidence shows is deeply troubling. When I started out, I expected to see a rise in the instability of family income. But nothing prepared me for the sheer magnitude of the increase. At its peak in the mid-'90s, income instability was almost five times as great as it was in the early '70s, and, although it dropped somewhat during the late '90s (my data end in 1999), it has never fallen below twice its starting level. By comparison, permanent income differences across families have risen by a more modest, if still troubling, 50 percent over the same period.  The full explanation for this dramatic rise in instability is still unclear, but two causes loom large. The first, and most obvious, is changes in the nature of work. In today's postindustrial economy, less skilled workers are much more vulnerable than when unionized, manufacturing labor was more of the norm. (Not surprisingly, instability is greater for families headed by less educated workers, though  it has actually risen more quickly in the last decade for workers who went to college. ) Workplace benefits, such as health insurance and pensions, have been on the chopping block. And corporate America increasingly relies on part-time, contingent, and contract workers--all of whom enjoy precious little security....  Perhaps the most promising idea for creating such a system is a simple proposal I call "universal insurance"--a kind of umbrella insurance policy protecting families against catastrophic drops in income or budget-wrecking expenses. Premiums would be a small share of total income and payouts would be based on the decline of disposable income from its previous base, with the share of income replaced higher for lower-income families.  Universal insurance could, in turn, be coupled with a less regressive and dangerous form of personal accounts than those advocated by Bush. These tax-free accounts would help families manage unavoidable household expenses before they reached catastrophic levels. Each year--and upon the birth of children--the government would contribute small amounts to each account. These public contributions would vary inversely with income, offsetting the regressive distribution of the tax breaks.  Universal insurance would protect Americans before they fell into poverty, lessening the burden on programs for the poor and protecting the dignity of beneficiaries. From the standpoint of income protection, what matters is not whether some are rich and others are poor, but whether all Americans are protected against precipitous drops in their standards of living. Universal insurance would depart from existing social insurance programs in providing general risk protection. Its premise would be that Americans need access to more than existing, highly segmented programs--programs that not only leave glaring gaps, but also lack the ability to respond to a rapidly changing world of risk.   Maybe I'm just another idealistic tax and spend liberal youth who doesn't trust God enough, but I think the United States would be a better place if something like universal insurance with non-regressive personal savings accounts was implemented.
