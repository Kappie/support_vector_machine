So now i have a red palm as well as a green palm in my balcony, they are quite tall about 2.5 metres.  Missed watching cartoons this morning! I went to church earlier than usual since i had lunch with some people* ( brother and his gf...). My brother has stopped going to church since he was 16 so it did not bother him to check whether we could make it. I love watching prince of tennis really, and yu gi oh. By any chance you watch them? I think the Japanese make the best cartoons. So church was the usual.  My dad is not catholic so he goes to another church with my grandmother, so he came later to pick me up and Harry, Harry's dad does not go church unless it is some event like christmas mass or passing over feast and to think he is my godfather, godfathers are supposed to guide you spiritually but i guess it is really more for the formality.  Now, the juicy bits. Lunch. I still cannot how a pathetic sod like my brother(i am delibrately making him look bad cuz i am jealous,hahaz) could actually get a girl. Well he brought her back for their term break, so she's living in his place, thats why he does not come over so often now. She must be able to cook cause he is total crap at it.  Well she's ok looking, not supermodel but funnily enough she is taller than my brother who is not exactly a 6 fter himself. Well she seams nice enough, and i wld not mind her getting married...hahaz. She spent more time talking to my dad then my brother if i had not known better i would think she was flirting with my father than rather than my brother. But i have one misgiving, she keeps calling me "baby brother" do  i look that young? or is she just stupid. When she met me and harry she asked whether we were about 12 year old? how dumb can you get, i bet even in America we do not look like twelve year old kids i think she was just being dumb. Also she loves saying"how true...blah blah." "How true,blah blah".  Ok so thats about it for lunch, dinner was fine. Then i decided to come and write this message for the blog and thats about it, it's about 10 o'clock so i wld be going to sleep soon, have a biology test morrow.  Love to you,
