All that I needed to hear from you something of value but something untrue all that I wished that I'd find within you stings when I see all the ways that you took me for granted and told me its through picked from my pockets and smiled empty is nothing and nothing is you I think I'll just sit for awhile  All that I wished that I'd find with in you something of value something untrue
