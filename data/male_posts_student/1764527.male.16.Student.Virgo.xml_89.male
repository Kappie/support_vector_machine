 Ms. Anthony's class was painful, like always.  Web Page Design was pretty good, I got a new computer in there.  It's a 1 GHz G4 eMac.  LOL, you know your computer is slow when a cheap Mac is has a faster CPU.  (I've got a 700 MHz Celeron chip.)  Enewayz, we still have to use Photoshop 6 in Classic mode for our work, rather than the much-improved Photoshop 7 on OS X.  LOL, that prolly went over most of y'all's headz.  DeSha's class was aite; nothing stands out.  English was okay, we started reading Frankenstein in there.  Ms. Conn wasn't at school today for some reason and Amber, Michelle, and I went to Ms. Filson-Staggs' room and did other work in there.  Calculus was actually bearable.  Shont and Terrance helped me and I, with the help of Robin after school, finished my work by 3:15 p.m. 
 One thing that happened while I was out that is kinda funny is that many of my teachers were also absent.  It seems like whenever I'm out all the teachers miss school, too.  I swear I'm not out partying with them or anything...LMAO! 
 Jerry is kinda pissin' me off now because he didn't get Jessica's number for me today because he said someone in band sucked right in front of that kid's mother.  I don't really understand why that prevented him from getting the number, but, okay.  I want him to get the number, Richard, because I'm chicken shit and scared to death to talk to her when I see her.  I plan on saying stuff to her but whenever I actually have the opportunity I always get scared and end up not saying anything.  Jerry has said he will get the number for me because I'm so scared.
