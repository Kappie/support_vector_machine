Well, the day started off great Baron woke me (Well him) up, We went to Bill's right after that, to cut up a tree. Fun Fun Fun. After that we went to Jonathan and Holly's to get rid of the deck that was moved by wonderful Charley. Baron threw me into the pool, later I tried to kick a piece of wood and I fell in again. So I got to go swimming twice today, fully clothed!! Speaking of this hurricane we are out of school for a week since, there is no electricity. Okay now back to my day....After that we came home (to Jean's) I took a shower and then Jean took me to my house and since then have been waiting on the computer hoping to get a chance to talk to Nicole. She is just a sweet person to talk to. O but i didn't get to tell you the best part Baron may allow me to ride with him, to Nicole's. I hope i get to go b/c i would love to get to see her.  Well, I hope everybody is doing okay, and Micheal is going to kick my butt!! LOL Bye, thanks for reading   Nicole, writing for Mike
