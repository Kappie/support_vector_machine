Sunday could have ended better, a lot better.  Things were on people's nerves, affairs of the heart were hardly appropriate.  Humans are strange.  They are the source of most of life's problems and their solutions, and always seem to get lost somewhere in between destroying and creating.  I don't trust many of them, maybe I'm cold, maybe I'm too distant.  You can't trust a creature that doesn't know what end is up, and whether going forward is any less painful than looking backward.  I'm tired from all of it.  I'll try to help him, but he doesn't trust me.
