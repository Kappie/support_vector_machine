There's only so many science fiction novels you can read before you find them tedious and pointless, I'm going for about 30, but I suppose people can start with 0 if they like...  That's life for you...  I'll leave you with this:  Why is it that when you are obsessed about getting sunshine out of oranges you are "crazy" and when you're obsessed about a person you are "in love"? :/  Go Figure...  Meh...
