It also reaffirmed my belief that there are only three types of movies out now:  1) Epic period pieces 2) Comic book movies 3) Comedies starring at least two of the following: Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, Jack Black  I am not complaining about any of these.  Bagel, don't you have some sort of insurance? In any case, you could always rent a car from Branca in the meantime...
