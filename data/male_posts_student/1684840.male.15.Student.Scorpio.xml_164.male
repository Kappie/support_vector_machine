School was really crap today.  ICT was funny because lots of us didn't know what we were doing.  Physics was good, we looked at an oscilloscope and then did another practice paper for the modules next week.  French was blood horrific - as usual.  We had Chemistry in W1 and it was really boring, and we're also going to be in there on Wednesday too... great    Food was...       ... Yep!  Terrible.  We sat there in the dreaded W1 doing a load of Shoite.  That was it basically.  We did some questionnaire thing and... yeh.  So for the longest day of the year, the weather was fine, perfect, super duper!  But the day, in my opinion...  Bit It
