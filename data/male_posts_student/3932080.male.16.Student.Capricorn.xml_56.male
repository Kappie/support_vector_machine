Having large breasts has always been one of her perks, though going for the world record seems an ultimate achievement. As international researchers looked at pictures of the woman's progress, they reported that the rise of plastic surgery use to mold busts may eventually put  Kleenex  out of business. Then they realized what they were masturbating into.  Meanwhile, a 33 year-old man in Romania announced plans to sell his penis to a victim of a genital cut this week. The man,  Constantin Dugulan , wants the money to support his younger brothers, and in the past has offered to sell his kidneys and one of his eyes. Though details are still foggy, a second reason for the sale surfaced earlier today. Responding to the most common query ("Why don't you want your penis?"),  Dugulan  said this: "I'm married; I don't need it anymore."
