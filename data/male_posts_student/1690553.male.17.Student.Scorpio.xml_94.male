See wether I could apply what I've learned in English Literature during Form 4  Form 5 in this poem. ;-)     To A Friend   An unexpected meet,  In the month of Ramadhan,  Month full of blessing,  Each a total stranger,  But together our horizon expanded   We shared joy and laughter,  Up and down,  Checking on each other  Although without face nor voice   An unexpected twist,  Of fate and time,  A wake up call for me,  To be a better person   You trusted me,  When others have not,  You tought me to trust,  When I have not   Our friendship might be short,  But I treasure every bit of it,  A true gem,  In a mountain of glass   We might part now,  Our path might never cross,  Thanks for everything,  Your time,  Your company,  Your views,  I can't never thank you enough      The writer's name is not mentioned, for secrecy perhaps? Oh well, the writer must be a Muslim, the first stanze clearly mention the month of Ramadhan. The month that their friendship begin.  The last line of stanza two -  Although without face nor voice  suggests that the friendship is thru the internet, must have been chatted a lot eh? Or at least emailed each other.   Stanza three, something unexpected happened, something suprising that might halt their friendship. But it is not that bad, the writer somehow became a better person due to the event.  The next stanza talked about trust. Ruqayyah had made he/she learn to trust and share with somebody else by trusting him/her first. Something he/she had never done before. If it's really meant to her, Ruqayyah must have been a very good friend.  Then the writer thanks Ruqayyah for their friendship, saying that she is a true friend. The words  Our friendship might be short  might indicates that the month of Ramadhan mentioned in the first stanza is the month if Ramadhan of this very Hijri year! That's only two months! Well, but the friendship had bring benefits to the writer I presume, and he/she highly appreciate it.  The last stanza, the writer says goodbye and he/she thank her very much. Don't know why they might never meet again, but it must the unexpected event in stanza three.  That's the meaning of the poem. Let us see the language side. The words used is simple, plain words composed into the poem. Simile is used in stanza five -  A true gem, In a mountain of glass .  That's all I can say, forgot must of what I've learned already. :-P Oh well, I do this analysis just to give some work to my brain so it will be ready to learn again anytime.   - Sound of  Raikan Cinta  by  M.
