Yesterday my mom and I were trying to go somewhere  but when we tried to start our car it wouldn't start. After calling some places my mom discovered that the battery was 'drained' and needed to be replenished by driving for about one hour on the highway. We drove around for a while on the highway then came home. Today we started the car without trouble but my mom insisted to buy a new battery. Why does this story have any value to anybody? Well is doesn't but I still like to tell usless stories.   I still have 62 days left of summer holidays!  I have so far had 5 days of summer vacation and not done one single thing. My proudest summer moment to far is getting my Gmail account, which is pretty sad. As for what I am going to do this summer, I plan to help out at our store, play in the Alberta Summer Games, and blow something up. My friends dad works in the United States and always brings back firecrackers. Although firecrackers ar ilegal in Canada, I still enjoy using them. These aren't your regular firecrackers these ones are waterproof and just about as loud as a .22 rifle. As for the Summer Games, it will take up two weekends and hopfully be very fun. An extremely bad thing about the Summer Games is that you have to sleep in school floors on mats. I have never slept on a school floor but can make a fair judgment that it will not be very pleasant. From time to time I sleep on my own floor but that is alot different. As for helping out at our store it pretty hard work because we I would have to do the cash register, ice creme, stocking, and firewood. I officially hate firewood! We sell about an average of 250 bags of firewood per day and have to carry each one across the parking lot. After a while the weight of the bags doesn't bother me it is the rude customers. All the customers think that there getting ripped off and think that we must carry all of them and load them into thier car. One example is when a very strong man made one of the female workers, with a borken wrist, carry a bag of firewood to his car. What a dick eh!  I am pretty tired and waiting for  The Simple Life 2: Road Trip  to start.
