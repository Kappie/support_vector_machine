I am now travelling back home with Hann's family in their car. Why, you ask. Listen.  First, let me narrate today morning.  We woke up at 9+. HaHa. I was kinda suprised that no-one woke us up. At night, I was kinda scared. Yeah. The living room was so dark, and sounds from the outside could be heard. Very natural. I can't even hear that kind of sounds if I open my windows in my home at night. The vast difference between surbudan and city environements. Anyway, me and XC woke up first, followed by the rest.  We brushed our teeth and went for breakfast at the same food center we went to yesterday for brunch. I ate yi mee. Nice.  After that, we moved our luggage and went to YH's eldest aunt's place. I took quite a while, about 30 minutes, before reaching there. Malaysia is sure spaced out.  (Oh my. My noce bled just now. I wonder why that happened. I nose bled so frequently this year.)  At the aunt's place, we watched some TV and played card games.  YH's parents mentioned that they are going back to Singapore today. YH then told me "Wanna go back, KY?" That set me in deep thought. Should I go or should I stay? I used a coin to help me made my decision (just like WanWan. Using a coin is not a stupid thing to do.....). In the end, I decided to go.  The relatives tried to persuade me to stay. I held my foot and refused to. They suspect Hann bullying me. Hann and XC said "No" loudly. I don't want to blow up the situation, and save them some face, I said they were not to be blamed.   Why? AsI said last night, I was feeling quite unhappy. The situation did not improve this morning. If I stayed, I would haave made myself felt more terrible. Knowing me, I would burst out sometime later. I rather leave now than lose my friends later. Yea. Besides, when WQ arrived, I would vent my fustrations on him. That would be very unfair to him.  Besides, there's this worry about the money factor. I am so afraid I would spend it all on Genting/Theme parks. Lame reason....  I just realized that this is my retribution. Retribution for bullying WQ. Now, I was being punished. I fully understood how bad WQ felt. My karma finally caught up to me. From this experience, I learn that bullying/ostrasizing is a terrible thing to do. I'll not do that to others in the future.  I hope they would treat WQ better than they treated me. I know they are planning to ostrasize WQ. Trust me. Being ostrasized is not fun. I've been there.   I can't wait to go back. There's about 3 more hours to go before we reach JB. See ya later.   HOURS LATER   Heya! I am back from Malaysia! What a trip! Let me continue from where I left off.  After blogging, I fell alsleep. Yit Kai and the mother slept too. Yit Kai was so cute, the way he sleeps. HeHe. I slept till about 4.50+. We stopped at a rest stop. For the next 10 minutes, I stared at the surroundings and did some calculations on when we would reach JB. I figured we would reach there at aound 6. I took out my Reader's Digest and started reading.   At 6, we went to YH's grandmum's house (maternal side). We would be staying there till 7.30, then we would set off. They said going off at 7.30 would avoid the jam at Causeway.   Me, YK and the mother went to Pizza Hut to eat pizza (Heh. They were organizing Pizzas today). I got to choose the pizza. I chose the Hawaiian Chicken. Nice! I also got to drink the musroom soup and the pepsi can. I ate two slices, the mother ate one. YK is so good at eating! He can finish two chicken wings, a cup of coup, a glass of Pepsi and three slices of pizza. Woah! Oh yeah, Auntie brought me snacks to bring back. Thanks!   We went back to give food to Grandmum and Uncle. We watched the Ben Yue till about 7.40, then we made our way back to Singapore.  It was quite a jam. Yeah. Something horrifying happened. My passport didn't get stamped by the Malaysian customs. The lady asked for my train ticket, but I left it with XC. That got me into a fix. Luckily, Auntie and Uncle helped me out, and I was cleared. Phew.... after the encounter at the Malaysia custom, we queued up to get through the Singapore cusoms. It wasn't too long before we are cleared. After that, Uncle and Auntie fetched me back to my block. I thanked them and went up.  Phew! Home Sweet home! The sofa changed. It became shorter and more cute. Heh heh. I took a bath, went online, then watched Charmed. O.o!! Charmed was nice.   I went online, and saw them online too. They interrogated me. I didn't answer much, because I have no mood to be interrogated. Wendy called and we talked lor. I told her what I went through. She listened and gave me advice. Ben soon knew what happened and went to confront them about it. I am thankful for his efforts.  Wendy told me that they were only 'joking' and also said  that she felt guilty for "bullying" me. She often joked with me and all. However, i don't feel angry. You know why? There's this huge difference between how Wendy jokes and how they jokes. The tone for example. Wendy's jokes are just for fun, but their tone makes it seem that they are not joking and is intentionally hurting me. Another thing is that Wendy knows when to stop, but they don't. Jokes stop being funny once it goes beyond more than few. It starts to hurt.   I observed the Lai family during my trip back. They seem very close-knit. Uncle kept having fun with YK and being a great father. Auntie too. However, I saw the vast difference betweeen how YH treats his parents. He seemed to regard them as aliens. He pushed his father away today when Uncle tried to play with him, and rejected Uncle's offer to fetch him back, rudely. He didn't really treat his mother that well either. Very unlike YK lor. I felt that YH was missing a whole lot on family warmness, but hey! Who am I to judge? These are just my observations and thoughts, as a stranger.   HaHa. I better go now. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
