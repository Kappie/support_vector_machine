I get to enjoy even more reading today. I really need to get into the groove of massive reading.  Well... let's see what's new with me. I got emails from Rafael, Esther, and Shanna recently which was cool. Those are all people I haven't talked to seen in ages. It was quite cool to hear from them. Heh... I also sent one of those screaming ghost things to Steff, and she responded that she opened it up and work. Hah... that must have been a funny sight! I feel bad... truly I do, but man... they made the entertainment factor go way up.  Today... I get to do more photocopying, buy some really expensive books, and read. Oh and I also need to go to the DMV to try to become a NY state resident.  In rotation lately has been  Millencolin .  ***
