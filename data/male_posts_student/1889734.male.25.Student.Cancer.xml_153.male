I'm exhausted by the constant wails about how we 'lied' about Saddam and our Iraqi actions are evil and false and immoral.  Fine.  You win.  Let's bring the troops home.  Let's leave Iraq to the Iraqis and just come on home.  Let Saddam crawl out of the shadows and assume his rightful place in power.  Obviously, the war on Iraq has brought nothing but evil and misery to the world, and we are to blame.  I'm tired of fighting against this crap.  Let the weenies win.  And the next time a few thousand Americans die, let them figure out how to fix it.
