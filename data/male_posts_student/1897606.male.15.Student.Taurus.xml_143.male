This man, of course, is Emilio Estevez.   Surely you remember him as the almost-too-manly coach in  The Mighty Ducks, D2: The Mighty Ducks , and let's not forget,  D3: The Mighty Ducks . They called them misfits, they said they would never go anywhere, they called them "ugly ducklings," but Emilio, he said, "You may be ducks-- You MAY be ducks! Sure, you might be ducks! But you are MIGHTY!" And so it went. Emilio and his children conquered the world of pee wee hockey, THEY WON THAT FUCKING CHAMPIONSHIP! No, not without determination. Not without pain. Not without the help of Lasso Boy and that fucking kid. But damn it, they did it. They pulled it out.  And at the end of the day, isn't that what it's ALL about? Pulling it out? (unintentional pregnancy is a  plague ) So much hatred couldn't put a dent in the resolve of these little people. And--ahh, I'm getting carried away. What I am trying to say is that Mr. Estevez is the greatest man on Earth, and everybody should send him a large sum of money:   Jimmy Cundiff/Cassian Elwes C/O William Morris Agency 151 El Camino Dr. Beverly Hills, CA 90210   (90210!!!!!!)  Do it for the kids.
