I am currently finishing up my second year and will use this space to tell the tales of heartbreak and pain that I encounter on a daily basis in my pursuit of higher education.  Hopefully a few of you will be able to relate and the rest of you will find entertainment in either my suffering in gerneral or just the sarcastic rants that my repeated failures incite.  Check back for updates periodically, i make no gaurantee as to their regularity as I may often be slaving away in the lab or drowning my sorrows.  cheers.  ~blair
