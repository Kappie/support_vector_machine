However it was full of people, and there was a live show going on -- a lot of very good looking girls putting on a musical. I don't think it was a real musical though, one of the songs they performed was "Love Shack".   After that, I decided to play some sort of  prank on a commanding officer. I was very nearly caught, and the entire base was put on alert. People were marching everywhere looking for the intruder, searchlights were sweeping all over the place; it was very tense.  I moved like a ninja, clinging to ledges, wall jumping, sneaking like nobody's business, and finally made it back to my tent, and went to sleep.   The next morning colonel Cathart (yah, the one from Catch-22), called me into his office. They hadn't seen me on the base during the alert, and knew I wasn't in bed. He had no proof that I caused all the ruckus, but he strongly suspected it. Instead of reprimanded me though, he shook my hand and gave me a plum tomato. He said that this kind of intense alert was very good for his men. He told me they performed admirably, and that this will be a real feather in his cap.
