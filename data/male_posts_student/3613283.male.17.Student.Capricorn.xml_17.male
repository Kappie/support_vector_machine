I have to say after almost three years,  I'm impressed by the ongoing commitment of the U.S. there . I believe that Afghanistan isn't progressing as fast as Iraq. Of course, we hardly ever hear about the situation there. There's actually a quote from Bush that says:  "This is hard work. And it wasn't easy work in Afghanistan by the way. I mean, it seems easy now that we're standing here after several years of working together with this great leader, but it was hard work..."  Bush is not the best speaker as we know all but this quote  sums it up quiet nicely .  Finally, this morning on CNN International on the European morning program 'CNN Today', one of the host was interviewing a guy from Christian Aid which is an organization involved in helping Afghans cope with their daily problems (water, security...).  He painted a somewhat disturbing picture , saying that Afghanistan wasn't safe at all and it was worsening. Listening to those comments, Allison Bell, the host, tried to get a quick YES/NO type of answer. Here's the script:   Bell, host : And quickly, a final yes or no question, is Afghanistan improving?  Christian Aid member : Yes, it's better than it was.   That wraps it up!   urlLink Channelnewsasia.com: Bush/Karzai Meeting
