But I can't bath for 30 minutes tomorrow, or else I will miss Digimon and I want to read the New Sunday Times before Digimon. I watched TV while waiting for breakfast. I ate fried carrot cake. This is becoming a ritual. Saturday eat carrot cake, sunday eat chee cheong fun. But nothing else to eat ma! After eating, watched more cartoons.  At 11.30, came online and chatted with XC, Wendy and Ben. I have to clear my SingNet inbox. All full of spam mail! I must unsubcribe to every one, just like what I did to my 60 junk mails from my hotmail account last time. It worked and I only get about like 5 per day. And I noticed a couple of SoBigF virus coming back to my inbox. I thought all erased already? I hope it doesn't escalate into the horrendous 80-100+ SoBigF mails I recieve! Horrible!!  I went to eat lunch at 12.4 and came back online at 1.30. Me and Wendy chatted about Prom Night (I was rather distracted, because I was reading articles on Wicca, and she thought Prom Night bore me). I was like having no idea whether to go or not. If I am going, my friends must go too. Wendy's very enthusiatic about Prom Night. She tried to persuade me to go, saying it wouldn't be fun for her if her close friends weren't there with her. Of course, I felt happy hearing that, but I still have reservations. I think....most probably, I would go lor. The way Wendy describe it, it sounds fun. I haven't decided yet ar! Then, I went off at 3.30 to play FFIX.  Alright! FFIX Updates! With 4 hours of efforts spent, I managed to upgrade my Chocobo to a golden Chocobo (being able to fly) and got all the Chocographs Pieces. I also found the Chocobo Air Garden. YaY! I am trying to find all the Chocograph Pieces I am having a bit of a difficult finding some. But I will look harder!   After FFIX, I ate dinner. While eating, I watched "8 Simple Rules To Date My Daughter" and "The Simpsons". After that, I bathed and came online.   I find myself listening to "Honey's End Of The Line", "Michelle Branch's Are You Happy Now" and "Hilary Duff's So Yesterday". I somehow feeel drawn to them. Maybe because of its strong content about moving on from broken relationships. I can really relate! Yeah!  I am eating instant noodles cooked by my father while writing this. I love the way he cooks the noodles. So spicy at the right amounts and so delicious! Yum! I can't bear to eat the last few strands, which are currently sitting on the plate! Ahh! I don't want good food to end!  Okay, I gotta be going now (to painfully, and not so painfully, devour the noodles). See ya tomorrow! Goodnight blog!
