(Yes, I realize that there is some irony in the fact that I'm using something along those lines)  Does this not add to the typical sentiment in today's culture of always needing the newest and most efficient product?  It seems to me that in a throw away culture where old TVs are thrown out because we want HDTV, we might want to look back and evaluate what progress looks like.  Relationships have become like images on a digital camera.  You don't like that picture?  Just delete it and nobody will be the wiser, and you have more space now to take a better one.  Back in the days where everyone used the good old Pentax single lens reflex camera you had to be careful to set the aperture and exposure times correctly or your picture would come out looking either white or too dark to make out the desired object.  The same could be said of our dependence on computers.  When people used type-writers, they had to figure out how they wanted to say it right the first time.  Similarly, we don't have the luxury of a delete button for our relationships.  We're a generation obsessed with experience, and it seems like we've become even more disillusioned when we realize that our actions have concrete consequences that we can't erase or throw away.  Let's try to recapture the beauty of the well prepared photo taken by an SLR camera in the way we deal with others!  Being fully present and incarnational in our relationships will help us to become a throwback to the cultures of old when people had time to listen and weren't interrupted by the ringing of a cell phone or the chime of a PDA.
