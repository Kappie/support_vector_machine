One half of great soccer left us 40 minutes away from a championship game birth. And for a second straight year, a lapse of concentration for no more than 10 minutes dashed our hopes. We played some of our best soccer for the first half gaining a 2-0 advantage at halftime. Our first goal came off a great pass from Josh and a simple finish from Jordan. Josh dribbled the ball down the side of the field, cut into the the box, and slid the ball in front of the goal after the goalie had committed. Jordan sent it into the back of the net with a simple instep touch. The momentum definently swung in our favor. Later in the half we controlled the ball just outside of the box. Brock took the ball and dribbled to the goal but was tripped in the process. A tactic Vine Grove would use throughout the game. At first it looked like it worked when Josh, our sure fire PK shooter, kicked it straight at the keeper. Luckily, we got a second chance because the keeper moved off the line before the kick. This time he placed in right inside that post. Victory seemed closer than ever. We were riding high and ready to send Vine Grove packing. Half-time came and we got a needed and deserved break. We were having so much fun that we didn't even talk strategy at half. No one could have anticipated what came next. Maybe we got a little cocky. Maybe we let our guard down. Whatever happened, it wasn't good. The half started well. We controlled the ball for the first couple minutes of the half and got off a few shots. I believe they were our last of the game. Fatigue began to set in and their fresh legs due to have a full roster of 18 began to control the game. Athanasis was missing from our defensive line, leaving a big hole. They had played well all weekend but it couldn't last forever. Fatigue led to mistakes and mistakes led to goals. Four of them to be exact. Nothing seemed to go our way in the second half. I guess it wasn't meant to be.  Somehow the State Championship crown managed to elude our grasp for the fourth time. I was going to blog about some the reasons I believed we lost the final game, but I decided it doesn;t do any good to dwell on the things I can't change. Vine Grove beat us. Maybe brute force and tactics that should be controlled by the refs come out on top of skill and finesse. I decided I would remember the the good things about this season and all the fun I had. Saturday is a prime example of something I will remember for years to come. The first game we played that day was easily our best played game of the season. After not seeing my teammates or playing soccer in over 4 weeks, I was eager to get back on the field. My teammates and I were ready to go. We got off to a sluggish start but then the pieces began to fall into place. Our first goal came when I picked up a lose ball, dribbled past one defender, and laid the ball off for Steve who was flying up on my right. I couldn't see him coming, but everyone else on my team could. I could have swore every person on my team was telling me Steve was making a run when I had the ball. That is how our team seemed to play all year. We play so well as a team. After Jacob slipped in goal and they scored, we took back our lead on a beautiful direct kick by Josh. In the second game, we beat our rival Fern Creek 2-0. I had a goal in this game off a great headed pass by Jordan. Jordan added the second goal after he pulled an amazing move in the back. One of the best goals of the season.   But its the fun I get to have with my team after the games that's the reason I love State Cup. After the second game, me, Jordan, Mike, Josh, Steve, and Jacob went to Longhorn for dinner. I never you could have so much fun at a restaurant. We were our usually goofy selves and our waitress played along with us. Jordan told her it was my birthday everytime she came to our table so I got free desert. Somehow during the course of the night we found out she was married, was 22 years old, was from Nashville, and was moving to Florida on Wednesday. The best part was when Jacob asked if he could atleast have a hug because they forget his food. She told us that we were her favorite group ever. There is never a dull moment when we're around. Later we went to the go-kart track for a little racing. That was a lot of fun, too.   No, we didn't win the state championship, but does it really matter? I had tons of fun this season. I met new people, made new friends, and got to enjoy a whole season with them. Now, all that matters is what I take from this season. I'll take those friends and memories and that's all that matters now.
