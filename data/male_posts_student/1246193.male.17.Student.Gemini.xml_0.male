Gregg found it funny so he wrote some of the things she said down.  Later, Ryan was reading it and she made the comment,"It is so funny you will pee." That is just one example of how very weird she is.  I decided to post some of her sayings, so brace yourself.  The following are quotes from that one girl who I don't know what to call.  ~Gypsies made my lip gloss. ~I smell crutons! ~Pie screams,"Banquet, Banquet, Fun Banjo." ~Bucket Brownies Car-Puddle! ~I thought it was a magic barrier. ~I think God is Jamaican ~My face is going to bunn off. ~Bow-Chica-Buga-Bow-Bow-Bow-Wow ~I am friggin' awesome! ~Boo-Yasimite ~Silly Gum Gunk ~I think I'm a genious. ~You're a bookcase. ~Tumbleweed Laca-Chaca Clothes pin. ~Flowers make Gumby Horny.                                                                                               Here is one of her poems: house-rock-school- grow grass grow! pie-hats-lips-car- grow grass grow! like-butt-turtle- grow grass grow! pass-clock-spork- I hate potatoes.                                                                                             And here are two names you may get called in her presence: Homeskillet Queer-tart  WOW, she is a very weird person, maybe more of a freak than Megan M.
