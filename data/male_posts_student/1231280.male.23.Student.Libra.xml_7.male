We actually got some spring break plans now too. Peiifer, myself and our neighbors (Cort and Brooks) are headin' up to Milwaukee the Friday right before SpringBreak. We're gonna stay at my aun'ts place and drink lots. I went to this site www.onmilwaukee.com and they have all these bar guides for Milwaukee. On Water St. there are 12 bars all within walking distance. It's gonna be really fun. Burlbaw came over tonight and we talked about shit, especially my automobile. Shit is cool, and we're gonna work it out - and I guess Toms hates me for some reason and is calling me a douchebag behind my back - fuck him. Well, gonna try to do some homework quickly and hit the sack.   -Sieckman
