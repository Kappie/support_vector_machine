I have been hacking lots of Ancient Chinese Ass for about 10 hours straight. My God. Let me educate you on the rules of Dynasty Warriors:  1. Hack 2. Hack some more 3. Wonder if there is anything else to the game other than hacking 4. Decide you don't care 5. Hack 6. Repeat  I swear, it really is an infinite loop. There is far too much game to this game...it has an ungawdly replay value, especially if you're one of those "100% Completion" people.  On another note, Imperian is out, I have played far too little of it on account of the DW4 and the presence of a cousin who hates text based games (and loves DW4.)  On another another note, school is a bitch, but it will relent in about...oh, five weeks or so. So until then, I study, hack sparingly, and get on the honor roll.  -Dice Squirrel Hack Jockey
