I Got My Gerbil Silver Ryan On July 14th And So Far Everything Is Going Good! On Thursday My Dad And I Went To The Lake (F'n For Hour Drive) With My Aunt,Uncle,  Cousins. Camping Now Days I 'Tell You... Camping Used To Be Setting Up A Tent, Cookin Up Hot Dogs  Smores, Fishin, And Sleepin! Camping Now Days Means You Fire Up The RV, Drive To The Lake, Unload The Boat Into The Water, Turn On The AC In The RV, Cook A Steak On The Stove Inside The RV (Maybe Over The Fire If You Are Real Daring), And Of Course You Sleep In Your Nice Comfy Bed!Now... I Will Be The First To Say That I Would Rather Stat In A RV Rather Then I Tent, Actually I Would Rather Just Stay In A Hotel/Motel And Go The The Lake In The Morning And Stay In The Hotel At Nights, And I Would Really Rather Just Stay Home And Watch TV, God... I Sound Like A Lard Ass! I'm Really Not I Only Weigh 113 Last I Checked (Around A Month Ago). I Have Never Really Posted What I Look Like.... I Have Brown Hair, I Am 5' 6-7", I Am 14, I Have Greenish Eyes, Umm... IDK What Else To Say About How I Look! Anywayz....I looked at are upcoming school calender and found out we start school on the 25th instead of the 23rd, that made me happy! I also found out that I am really fuckin tired! I really should be sleeping right not... but I'm not, but as soon as I am done with this I am going to bed! I just smacked the shit of of my lap top with my foot, Oh Well....! This weekend is our local 'Prarie Port Festival' nothing really special going on. My dad has to give a check to the 'Prarie Port Queen' for something, I guess since he is the Manager of the biggest store in this town (Wal-Mart) he just gets to do crap like that. I am not really a big fan of Christian music, but I heard 'Redemption' by Jars of Clay on the radio today when I was flippin through those wonderful stations and it was a really good song, you might wanna check it out!   I'm just about outta crap to say and gripe about... Post Agian Tomorrow (Or Today Since It Is 3:14)... So Much For My Happy Ending!
