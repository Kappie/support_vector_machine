Maybe I'll start using titles, but it's kinda hard to sum up the whole day in a phrase. And maybe if I'm wu liao, I will start titling all the other posts too.  Right. Today we went back to school to attend Maths Lecture for test corrections. HaHa. It's the first time I went to school with Janet and Gloria. HaHa! Yeah.   Me and CQ feel like extra like that. We took a different test ma. I spent the time talking to WQ (and scratching his face) and ignoring poor CQ. Sorry la!! I don't mean it one! I will talk to you, okay? :D  Okay. Friend's time. Be right back at 10.30.   Backity back! HAHAHAHA! Another 30 minutes of insane laughter! I am so enjoying Friends! Yeah.  Okay. Back to today. Me, WQ, Gloria and CQ went to Causeway Point. Poor WQ cat. We left him out of the conversation most of the time. Well, not that he really minded. He got QingTing to talk to on the train. But we felt kinda bad anyway. It's like the three of us got some kind of bond from being together for so long. Yeah.   Anyhoo, we met XC and KS and we decided to go eat Mos Burger. Actually, they decided. I grumbled about the high cost. And I ended up being the one who paid the most. Heh.   After that they went to tour Causeway la. We stopped at the steps on the 7th floor, waiting for Hann. Well, I was very quiet. Even CQ, Gloria and KS noticed. Why cannot quiet? I don't feel like talking ma. Yeah la. It's because of XC la. I am just not comfortable round him, due to that incident long ago. And you know me. When I am uncomfortable, I just freeze up. Also bo pian ar. They wanted to meet up with us de. So I just tagged along, silently.   On the steps, we witnessed a horrific incident! Somebody spilled coke. The cleaner actually made the parents wiped the floor lor. Ordering her around. HELLO! That was supposed to be his job. Like it's the baby's fault that he spilled Coke. The woman actually snapped at him. Jia you! I was actually waiting for that guy to come over to our side so I can be rude to him (Say "Haiyoh!! So rude!!" loudly). I can't stand people like him. Too bad I don't have the chance. I was actually glaring at him and seriously considering spilling my water on the floor. However, I remembered I was in PJ school uniform, so I cannot do things to disgrace the school. How I wish I was not in uniform! Sigh!   Before Hann can arrive, we went home first. Me, WQ, Gloria and CQ. Me and Gloria took the bus home. Yes.   Okay. After bathing and whatnot, I went online and conducted the course. Yes. Even courses are fun and educational. Then I went to read another H/D slash. That story was so touching! I kept crying from the middle chapters onwards. The angst, the happiness, the joys, the sadness. So overpowering! I kept having twingling feelings all over me! Such powerful emotions! Great story.  I went for dinner and all. Ayiah, that's not important. Gloria wanted the link. Well, she can't take slash that well. Heh. Well, beyond gay sex, it is really a powerful story. A great one. HaHa. Each to her own preferences la. If she's uncomfortable with it, I guess it's unlikely she can feel the high emotions the author manages to evoke out of the readers. Yeah.   I wrote Gloria's testimonial. Well. I think it sucks. I don't know. I'll write a better one next time. Yeah.   You know what? The three of us are so close that relatively no secrets are hidden from each other. They get revealed some point in time, no matter within an hour or months. Yeah. HaHa! See how open we are with each other? Very!  Hmm. See. I am jiemei with Gloria, now I am xiongdi with CQ. HaHa! Hilarious story how I winded up being both. Anyhoo, meow. :P  Oh yes! I did WQ's interview. Well, Question 3 and 4 were the same and I answered them as one. I wrote a really long answer. HaHa. I was kinda cynical la. But I was speaking the truth. Honestly, I think their group did not really looked at the issue thoroughly. Maid abuse cannot be prevented. It can be lessened, possibly. Prevented? Nah.  Right. I gotta get going. See ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!
