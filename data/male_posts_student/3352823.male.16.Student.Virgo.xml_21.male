We have the end of year assembly (great... more dancing) so all the periods are shortened. I only want ONE bit o' homework, and that's my History ISU. Aswell as my English ISU of course. Oh, and studying for my exams (in class) next week... And the ones in the exam week too. Great...   Then again, it's a good feeling; school is almost over. In about three weeks I will be able to chillax all day long. Until I find a job. Man I want a job badly. It's funny, a few months back I had no desire for a job... Now I really want one.   I have hardly anything to blog about... I think the next time I update, I'll actually have something to talk about *leers*.
