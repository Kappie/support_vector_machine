The unnamed Muscovite added a liter of petrol to his washing machine to help dissolve the stain, Itar-Tass news agency reported Monday, but the ensuing explosion wrecked his kitchen and demolished two internal walls.  Moscow police confirmed there had been an explosion in a south-eastern Moscow apartment, but would not comment on the cause.
