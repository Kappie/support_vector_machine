Maybe he'll end up buying another bike but I know he's gonna get this one, it's a Giant. No, the company is giant, it's actually perfect in size. I'm so excited I can't wait to ride that baby. Stack em to the heavens!!! Wow did this really annoying science project on asthma...and the movie "The Time Machine" just finished downloading on my computer. I have to watch it for extra credit in English and do a fate vs. free will essay. It shall be fun concidering I enjoy stuff like that. Ok ta ta, and to to too.
