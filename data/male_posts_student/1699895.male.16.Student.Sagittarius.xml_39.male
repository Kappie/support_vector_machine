Let me recap the main events of the stupendous time before summer comes (I like to call it "pre-summer")  THURSDAY: Mowed steves lawn and sleeeep  FRIDAY: Started opening up the pool!! First we removed the cover and cleaned the deck. Then we filled it up the rest of the way. Then, went to Phils to practice.  SATURDAY: Continuation of the opening of the pool.  Clean the rest of deck, and started circulating the water. Went to Phil's work and bowled two games with Brian, and then practiced some songs.  SUNDAY: Planted flowers with the family minus Lindsay and then slept some more, but ended up going to Mur's to play some Halo ^_^  MONDAY: Finished the opening of the pool!! Put in a clhorine tablet, and then shocked it, and in three hours, it was ready to go! But there was a problem that got fixed really late, so no swimming. Bob came over to do the bio.  That was my murly weekend! Hope everyone had a good weekend as well ( not really)  mur
