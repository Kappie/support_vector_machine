I’m getting weak in this game, a drop in stamina, strength, reflex and jumping height. And pretty soon, my right calf cramped and I had to drag myself off the court. Ooppss wrong move, my right thighs and toes cramped too as I moved. I can alone watch them play for the rest on the day.  It was 4pm+ when we made our way to Bendemeer shopping mall for lunch. Then Desmond had to bring up that Shuying remark on not seeing me in SP lately, as if I had some kinda special relationship with her. I kept quite… At the coffee shop, we got our seats and I was left to guard their stuff as they went to order their food. GREAT, my god sista (MuJiao) came along and so I waved. She U turned and headed for me. WHY IS MY GANG STARING AT ME LIDDAT??? She was standing beside me asking how’s life and stuff while I was sitting, well of cause I’ll ask her to sit down, and she did. THERE GOES THE STARING EYES AGAIN! And Desmond started the special relationship talk again. I got him over to sit with us and talk about Poly life. After ordering their food, the guys returned and moved away with Desmond to another table leaving MuJiao and me alone. WahLiew~ please loh, she’s attached… I’ve got someone in mind le, so quit thinking that I’m some kind of playboy or big flirt leh. I think she got kinda embarrass and left, but all those small talk didn’t fade away.   I knocked out as soon as I step into my home, all the way till 8pm. I took a shower before having dinner. Then I saw a shocking SMS on Baby T which came in which I was sleeping. TARA bought the Gundam Karapuchi set together with 11 more doreamons from the shop I intro her to. $63 on a single receipt just on figurines, such a serious collector sia. HAhahaa… She’s smart man… can even find the right shop from the ugly messy map I drew for her. Aiya, again I was chase off the com. This time I popped my head right above Lao Er’s head, and she was having a little chit chat with Tara.First, it was about her doramon collection, then it was about her grades and stuff. Stuff including not disturbing Tara.. Humhp~ blah blah blah…. zzzZZZ
