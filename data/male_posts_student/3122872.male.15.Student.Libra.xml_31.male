In respect of Jamie's various purchases, I have this for him:    *One finger salute*    *mutters* lucky b******    Ah well, I'm not to argue, the fat mess has returned, so if all else fails I have a new guy to get sheesh kebabed in my flash :)    I think I'd better go back to my own blog now, need to get the formatting fixed, and for Jamie's benefit I've changed the layout back :/    Hmm, this is the first time I've tried something that isn't Trebuchet, but I can't say much    Never trust a font that can't do colon forward slash properly...    Also (pay attention now Jamie) I've had a look at the site, and it looks pretty good, just a coupla points though    On the front page it says " company " and since when were we a company exactly?  Ummm, you guys left out the apostrophe in " we've " on the front page, just point out that spelling mistakes look pretty random...  WHAT THE FUCK IS WITH THE PICTURE OF A SURFER? (self explanatory really)  The logo at the start looks random, just a thought...  Can we please remove the "Site under construction" banner thingy? Since I'mthinking the site will always be under construction as we're adding things to it...   I know that was quite a few points, but just some stuff for our "Glorious Leader" to consider in his free time...  And when he has more free time he can go see wtf is wrong with the formatting in Life Eh?... :/    Over and out       James     urlLink Black Ghost Staff
