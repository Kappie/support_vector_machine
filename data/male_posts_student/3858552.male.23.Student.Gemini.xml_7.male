Let me introduce myself as an extremely liberal individual who is trapped inside the Republican hell of Mississippi.  I'm a college student at Mississippi State University and majoring in Secondary Education.  Now, a disclaimer to how I feel about Mississipians in general as well as the rest of conservative america, I've been doing some reading online with web polls regarding the 2004 election and as I figured, the pattern holds that the MOST uneducated and desolate states are DIEHARD bush supporters (I.E. Montana, Mississippi, Alabama, etc.) Now why do you think that is?  The republicans appeal to the poor and uneducated b/c a load of yokels down in Mississippi will vote for someone simply because they say "down with the queers."  I can just envision a truck load of idiots riding down the road in a pickup with a huge BUSH 2004 sticker on there bumper.. don't forget the truck will have tires too large for the truck itself and an antenna capable of picking up people in kentucky, wait..  I see that everyday around here.  It is a sad world when idiots will vote for someone just to protect their sacred christian values.  Religion isn't paying the bills and if you are waiting on God to help you.. think again.. it's purely coincidence that good things happen just b/c a deity says it's so.  Anyway, I wish there was some way to enlighten the yokels of how none of them gain anything economically from Republican power; as much as Mississippians in general believe that they are rich, they are no where near in the bracket with the weathly that truly stand to benefit from Republican platforms.  Don't get me wrong at the fact that Kerry isn't my prime choice for a president, but anything to get Bush out of power will do.  I also hope that people stop supporting Nader.  That is insane.. granted, I stand more with Nader than I do with Kerry, but c'mon Nader isn't going to win, he's only gonna push the vote in favor of Bush which is a complete 180 from Nader's views.  Why would the Nader supporters want to see that happen?  It just doesn't make sense!!
