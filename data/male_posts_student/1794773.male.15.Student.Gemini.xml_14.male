Oh and if you are looking for my group, on 1 of the 7 days, we will be wearing Orange tee shirts, and im gonna have an orange bandana on and orange tube socks!!! So look for the weird girl in all orange. Omg you guys, my brother found our website and hes threatening me that hes gonna look at it! I totally freaked out! AHH!! Hopefully my dad threatens him if ya know what i mean lol. Ok Orlando so far is going great!! Omg my youth leader left a couple of days ago for Orlando, and his flight got cancelled and delayed 2ce!! He said that most of the Northwest Airlines will be cancelled or delayed at least once! So maybe tomorrow wont be the best, but im sure ill have fun. I'm looking so forward to this trip. I really am gonna make an effort to find you guys! I love you guys so much! Love, Rach
