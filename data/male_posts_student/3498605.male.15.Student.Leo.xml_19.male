Well, we have tons of energy drinks and we will be so amped up on caffeine we will be like superman and have super reflexes. Hell, maybe we will even try to fly! Actually, we will play nine hours of Halo then nine of hours of Dynasty Warriors 4 with maybe one break for food. So, if I don't post anymore it is because I am dead :(. -lol. I'm just kidding, I won't die. Anyways, time for the Halo binge to start. If we are really schooling someone I can probably talk online. Anyways, more HALO HALO HALO HALO HALO HALO!  later, bradleyJ
