Here (and I don't know if this applies to anywhere else in the world)the girls are very uptight about everything...and what do guys my age want to do? Bone Girls? Well ya, but just get some...maybe even kiss? But no, not in hampton, we just settle for the old "Let's hold hands." So now I present you with a passage from the book of Nick Hornby. The book is called High Fidelity. It shocked me at how true this passage is. Without further ado.......  "Read any women's magazine and you'll see the same complaint over and over again: men-those little boys ten or twenty or thirty years on-are hopeless in bed. They are not interested in "foreplay"; they have no desire to stimulate the erogenous zones of the opposite sex; they are selfish, greedy, clumsy, unsophisticated. These complaints, you can't help feeling, are kind of ironic. Back then, all we wanted was foreplay, and girls weren't interested. They didn't want to be touched, caressed, stimulated, aroused; in fact, they used to thump us if we tried. It's not really very suprising, then, that we're not much good at all that. We spent two or three long and extremely formative years being told very forcibly not even to think about it. Between the ages of 14 and 24, foreplay changes from being something that boys want to do and girls don't, to something that women want and men can't be bothered with.....The perfect match, if you ask me, is between the   Cosmo   woman and the fourteen-year-old boy."  The truest thing I've ever head.
