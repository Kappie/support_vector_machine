 urlLink a nearby pumpkin patch . 
There were  urlLink giant bundles of corn stalks  all over the place to attract passers by. There was also this  urlLink pumpkin throne  that had a giant pumpkin as the seat back. After wandering around the place for a while, we found 6 that we liked. She was kind enough to get me a papaya while we were there. It's been years since I've tasted papaya so I'm eagerly looking forward to eating it. After leaving the pumpkin patch, we stopped at a nearby saloon for lunch. The saloon was this little rustic place with  urlLink wood tables that had been engraved  so many times that they make for a splendid sight now.
