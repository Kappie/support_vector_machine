Yes, that's right, my system still isn't done. In fact, it's a long way from done. But what the hell. I'll get there in the end.  I keep looking at other software for running the site.... all seems nice and friendly, BUT in 99% of all cases either costs money, or is far too powerful for my needs. That doesn't preclude me stealing ideas left, right and centre however. I'm at user specification stage for the site backend now, with a little bit of sample code having already been done. Chances are I'll have to do a rewrite at some point - the current system doesn't allow for templating, which is a big deal since there won't just be one blog on the site, but several (possibly as many as 10 if all of my friends want one of their own)...  Eventually I will get the site up and running. It works now, just not as flexible as I would like. Visit it, stop by our forums - we don't bite, honestly....
