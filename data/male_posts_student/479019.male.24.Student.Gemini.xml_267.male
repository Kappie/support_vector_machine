I would seriously say that insomnia is something that makes one of my flaws... the flaw of dwelling on the past... much worse. I guess it's because when you're up at 2:30 AM and you have nothing to do, your mind is left to wander. There are a lot of "what if" scenarios that come up, that I think tend to slow down the foreward momentum that life should be going at. Oh well... that's just me being me though.  I think I'm going to give sleep another shot. I need to go grocery shopping and get some other stuff done tomorrow.   **
