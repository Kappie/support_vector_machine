Not being able to choose his breakfast, and having no freedom to decide whether to eat pineapple or not. Poor Saddam. Here is an update; quirky to be fair, full of contradictions, but amazingly with a touch of grace.  "Saddam is being held in a white-walled air-conditioned cell, three metres wide and four metres long, Mr Amin said. He is kept apart from the other prisoners, who can mix freely with each other during the daily three-hour exercise periods."  "Since appearing in court, Saddam had taken to reading the Qur'an and writing poetry, Mr Amin said. "One of the poems is about George Bush, but I had no time to read it."  "Like the other high-value detainees, Saddam's day begins with a substantial breakfast, an MRE (meal ready to eat), which provides 1,300 calories. He also gets hot food twice a day, which could consist of rice or potato and broccoli, along with either fish, beef or chicken. For dessert, there might be oranges, apples, pears or plums,  but the former leader has developed a penchant for American snacks such as muffins and cookies ."   "He is looking after a few bushes and shrubs and has even placed a circle of white stones around a small palm tree," said Mr Amin, a Kurd from Kirkuk, who is the first member of Iraq's new interim government to visit Saddam. " His apparent care for his surroundings is ironic when you think he was responsible for one of the biggest ecocides when he drained the southern marshes ."   Even Saddam cares for morality, plant-life, and choice foods.
