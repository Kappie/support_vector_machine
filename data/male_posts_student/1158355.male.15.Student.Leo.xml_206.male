After school I got a haircut, went to the orthodontist and he got mad because I stopped wearing my retainer and now it doesn't fit my teeth. But I don't care my teeth are fine I don't want to go through the trouble of braces to get perfect white teeth. Turns up I'm getting more fucking braces. Not for a while though. Maybe college...or next year, well that's a major difference. 2 years, actually it's not, well for braces it is...or not. I'm sitting down in that damn chair while a little girl sits next to me. The orthondist says my baby teeth should be all out before 15, "He's never seen anything like this"...bullshit. Or maybe not. Maybe I'm just deformed. "If you got a deformed hand, close the window. Nobody wants to see that  urlLink shit ." I'm my old music on my computer...for instance right now I'm listening to CKY. Attached At The Hip. Ok I'm attached to RUSH so I'm gonna go watch some RUSH IN RIO! Woo! Cya.
