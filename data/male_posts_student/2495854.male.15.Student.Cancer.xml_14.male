RACHEL WROTE THIS POEM ABOUT OUR ADVENTURE IN SF: From Tiffany's to the streets of San Fran Going from place to place, without any real plan we were all busy stacking Our coordination, that day, we were obviously lacking The Urban Outfitters, four stories high And the matching choneys, that most of us decided to buy One word- boyfriend, two words- who cares Aby- please try not to break any more of the museum's chairs I love Luke-n, Kevin got layed I wish, in the city, longer, we could have stayed "Chu can have it!" as Carson would say So much for that rainy, stormy, freezing day Carson, this is your last warning, and step away from the bus Mardi Gras Beads- always a must The big green thing in Macy's, he's Tanya's friend We all dropped hard, from our sugar high, as we neared the end Enrique! Enrique! We love you so much! Be careful, in the museum, the walls, you're not allowed to touch "Go back! Go back! We'll come back around!" Pat and Carson yelling "Wait for us," was the only sound The chick in the Disney store She wanted to know Why Brandon, hardly had anymore Everything's bigger in Texas, so cowboys make better lovers The trip seemed like it started, and all of a sudden it was over Sorry, I'm straight And with my Jamba Juice, I have a date Actually it's silver, don't you know? Brandon came prepared, with lots of dough We got married and divorced, in ten minutes flat The birds flew over, and on us, we almost got shat No adults- unless accompanied by a child Annie took us on a speed boat trip, it was pretty wild We stole all Erik's fun I can't believe it's all done Elevators, and tic tac toe So many places, we didn't have time to go You're going down to china town!
