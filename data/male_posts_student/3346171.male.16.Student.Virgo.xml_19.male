Dad and mom went to Vit√≥ria Mall, right now they're buying a DVD. i wished so mucha DVD and they finally bought one. Well, the weekend is good so far.. let's see the end of it. When they get in home i'll go to Dolphin, it's a video store, they have a nice promotion there. 5 dvds, twelve reais. i guess that's the promotion.
