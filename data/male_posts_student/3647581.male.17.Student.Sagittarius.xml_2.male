I trust I wont be mislead and I just thought too far into a friendship but through thorough examinations of myself and chatting with longtime friends I've discovered everyone needs a buddy. I've got mine(mostly my journal and brain) and that's all they are so im sure that's all heather and josh are. Anyway all you indie rock fans out there on June 22 go to www.team-love.com for buttons stickers t-shirts and other sweet goodies from the tilly girls and boys(tilly and the wall). Check out this band world they are coming up them and willy mason hes on the TL site too. So long for now.
