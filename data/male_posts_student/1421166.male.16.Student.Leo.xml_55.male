And through the unreliability(sometimes) of Man, I've seen the love of God to a greater extend. I was hurt when Man rejected me, but then I realised how God will feel hurt when we reject Him the same way. But still, His love never fails, but endures forever. I thought I stood alone, but there are people who truely stood by me. Even when I overlooked their concern. But now I see. And thanks to all of them. Today, I was able to feel busy with God's work again. It seems tiring, but it feels good to me, it's a totally different thing when doing school work. I guess it's the knowledge that we're doing something meaningful. After that, hung around Weiyi. It was nice just spending time with him. Then went to play basketball with some YFers. It was a nice feeling exercising again. But just that I feel really unfit now. Guess I'm better at indoor stuff. Hehe... Ok...I'm happy now I guess. I just need to improve on my relationship with God now.
