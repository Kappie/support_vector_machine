The lunch is sponsored by yours truly after my client dumped a couple of hundred bucks in my Maybank Account. ;-)     [L-R]Hafizah  Azra      [L-R]Qayyum, Anuar,  Me. Why all of us eyeing the other table?      [L-R]Azra  Nad   The lunch is scheduled at noon but have to wait for Azra to settle her stuffs at Yayasan Pahang. Then have to wait for Qayyum and Anuar some more. Only at 12.40pm we headed to Pizza Hut. I made the order quickly and then we get into some chat, updating each other what's up with our friends. Which university to go is the main topic, followed by what jobs we have done and some gossiping of course. :-P Those saucy gossips is kept to us, I won't tell it here. Back to our main topic, looks like only me  Hafizah are waiting for UIA Matriculation. Nad  Qayyum will go to KPM Matriculation. Azra will go to MMU of course. Anuar? He still waiting for an offer.  All in all, it's a good meet although at my expense. After all, I don't know when would I see them next time. So better treat them this time. Ok folks, I'm off to KL (again) tomorrow evening. And good luck to all post-SPM students!
