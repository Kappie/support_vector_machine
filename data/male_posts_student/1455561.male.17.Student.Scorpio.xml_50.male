The woman asked him if it was his first time taking it and he said it was his third.  aha he is rich and stupid: i mocked him in my mind and he never even knew.  And then i got off the bus aha.  "my expectations where confounded and hence the humour arose"  i think i am arguing with a teacher from my school by the comments on robs blog.  Rob knows when i post so i can basically be as mean as i like and he knows i am only joking (at least thats what he thinks. haha).  Rob told a lot of teachers about his blog so they all think i am being horrible for real and one has been arguing with me.  Admittedly the argument has moved on to whether astronauts could beat up cavemen but its still funny.
