It's 6:30 in the evening and dinner is on the table, but to me it feels like morning, because I just got up, having gone to bed3 hours previously. I don't take naps; this is why. My sleep schedule is gonna be off for a week. Anyway, they want me down at the dinner table, but to me it's breakfast, and it's way to early for me to be able to handle it. Ok, I've had a shower I'm a little better now. We just saw Seussical! and one of the characters was so Thomas it was funny. Thomas, you are now Horton the Elephant. Then weplayed DnD until until the wee hours of the night. I was a drunken mad dwarf. It was fun. Then I got carwashed. ANd cars got washed by me, and so did the dog only not really. Ok, more sleep now. Adios! Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!
