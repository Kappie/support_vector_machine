I enjoy school because I get to be around my friends. Ok, enough with that sentimental stuff; Let's get on with news concerning school and the rpg and everythining in general.  My schedule durring the first term of my junior (11th) year of school is quete challenging... which scares me because I'm a lazy bum. I will start my day with a nice relaxing ninety minutes of Visual Arts level 3. I like to draw but usually I am too busy to so... so this will give me a chance to get my creative juices flowing. After that I will make my way to AP Government. That class will probably be hard but oh well I like history / social studies classes. Mind you I don't do very well in them... I just find the subject matter interesting. Ok... Now to my next class, AP Chemistry. Boy oh boy is that going to be rediculously hard. I only passed ACP Chemistry with a 90% mark so God only knows what I'm going to make in AP. However, Chemistry is cool. Haha... AcetoneRPG... (Lame joke) After AP Chemistry I will go to lunch. I will probably end up having something like a chicken strip basket which includes chicken strips, fries, and a honey mustard container or maybe I'll end up getting a chicken sandwich or a handburger... or if I'm in the mood a nice salad. Now, for my fourth and final class of the day, Information/Technology Services... a.k.a. CISCO I. Yeah, that's right, I'm taking a CISCO certification class in my school. I just hope that's not hard. And that's my day.  As you can see my school day will be very academically challenging... and even more so in the spring because I'll have Lit 11 ACP-Gifted , AP Chemistry 2, Algebra/Trig, and CISCO II. And also, as you may be aware, I will probably be swamped with homework. But alas, I shall still try and find time to work on my mmorpg and my sites.
