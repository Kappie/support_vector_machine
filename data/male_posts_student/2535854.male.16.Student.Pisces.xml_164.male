Two drinks at Starbucks can cost like rm20++ while Mamak is like err anything from 2 - 4 bucks for two drinks!Insane!But well..thats the price you pay for higher quality stuff and perhaps some class and stuff...haha..      Woke up pretty early..at around about 8:20 am.spent the next 3 or 4 hours helping mom  dad get ready to go to Ipoh. So in the end they left at about like 12pm so yay!I`m all free!Got the house to myself pretty much...can cause all the havoc I want and go out whenever!Sadly  urlLink Cheryl  wasn`t free so couldn`t go for Paella or something..and Sarah was at a family gathering so no coffee for her!Tried getting  urlLink Michelle to go for that long lost coffee we wanted to get and stuff...but she was to busy with her Chemistry work and stuff which is well too bad..looks like wont be able to get that drink for another month i`ll bet with how my weekends are shaping up unless....      So called up my old budddy Chaman and we could re-live our glory days or triumph such as last year with all these personal issues. Well he tried calling Mich again and she asked her mom but she couldn`t so there went any chances of her getting to call Jennifer to come or something.Didn`t wanna call  urlLink ZA  cause then there would be a difficulty in talking about rather sensitive issues and subjects.      So we met up at Starbucks at 4:30 pm or so..Appearently my Starbucks card is all full up so I can redeem now!Actually coulda just now but decided nah...Well anyway I had a Green Tea Frap. I never really liked green tea before this =) . Well we talked about how Smbb was, how Michelle doesn`t deserve a looker such as Rizal or ZA who seems to have something for Joanna?YUCK!!!!!!!!!!THE THOUGHT OF HER CAN MAKE ME PUKE!!!! Also on how Permesh dumped Temmengung and joined Syahbandar so he could get glory and with Syahbandar in the end sweeping up all the events.WTF. No wonder why Jia Liang was so proud of himself leading them to glory and crap. Lotta other stuff mentioned as well.      Then at like 7pm we got up to ciao but instead kept talking and at 7:30 pm decided to go to Pelita for drinks. rm3 only for 2 drinks! I belanja :p. hahaha..had air limau ais and then started dissing Eu Git. Need to give his phone number to all sorts of characters and stuff...teach that whore a lesson.      So then ciaoed back at 8pm past and decided to have a nice cool jog home. Turns out my hamstring isn`t troubling me as much as I though I could..Surprised I was running quite smoothly and no problems...Maybe the nagging and pulling pain isnt so severe or anything.      Anyway had pizza for dinner. Then like Went online and then at like midnight I fell asleep. Woke back up at 1 am but then slept until 5:45 am..haha..and I was still 'online' and not away!Musta gotten disconencted :p. Heh and blogged my previous entries. It says so down there biatch!
