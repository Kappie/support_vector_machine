This new film is basically 2 hours of Bush bashing, just as "Bowling for Columbine" is 2 hours of American-bashing.  Moore claims that the new documentary proves the Bush administration knew about the 9/11 attacks before they happened and that Bush has only increased terrorism w/ the liberation of Iraq.    The film won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival this past week.  Amazing!.  An Anti-Bush film winning the top prize at a film festival held in France.  How can it be?!?!    Fahrenheit 9/11 hasn't been released in the United States yet.  Disney has used its veto power of Mirimax films to stop distribution of the film.  Moore will surely find a liberal film company to release the film.  It wouldn't surprise me if it hit theaters in September.  Right before the general election.    Moore is now claiming that he has come into possession of 20 minutes of new footage from the Nick Berg beheading video.  Maybe someone could make a film about how Moore knew that Berg was going to be beheaded?
