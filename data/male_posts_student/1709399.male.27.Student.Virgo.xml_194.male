Though there is no denial that the ads are an election stunt (That money is well off spent elsewhere) , the truth is that India is definitely shining in some areas.                                         In my opinion the biggest achievement is that Indians have started believing in themselves  also now for the first time truly believe that we can become a superpower. To me that is "India Shining "and not the mere numbers .
