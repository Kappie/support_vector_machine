He is cool. We don't really know how we started talking, but all we know is that we are friends now. I have a friend in Miami, lol. I spend the morning helping an agent that works with my mom. Her name is Deb Swann. She wanted me to show her how to make her computer faster, so I showed her and her husband, and I also defraged the computer. That was cool. They have a cat, which reminds me of me, lol. Well, I better go, I don't wanna be rude to Quinn and ignore him.
