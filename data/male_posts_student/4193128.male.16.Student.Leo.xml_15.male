Jennifer might get jealous if i say that i love you guys shes my girlfriend i am so not telling her about this log so i can get all my stress by talkin shit about everything i love so i so do not blow up on them. i so hope they do not find this blog anyway lot of my good friends dont know me that well (my swim team peeps) and the people i do know me way to well (backstabbing best friend) so ill try to fill you in on a big part of my life that is extremely depressing  last year I so met this girl you know this is gonna be depressing when i start like this who i deeply fell in love with at this time i had a good friend for about 8 years we were great buddies and we were like sychic the only problem with this good friend was he has this habit of stealing girls that i liked so you cold say that he really isnt that great of a friend but I have known him for so long and were like brothers so to be cautious i specifically told him to stay away from this girl i said i like this girl about twice a day for like two weeks this was at like the end of the year so i so was sheepishly talkin to her you know the little wave hi and running away fast cuz your so nervous the hey how was your day and than acting like your a retard by tripping and hitting her with the biggest book (bio honars that book was a bitch) and feeling so god damn embaressed  so i finally was getting the nerve up to ask her out when we were talkin one day and says omg anthony i am so hoappy oh and dont be mad at joey he just asked me out as the world crumbles at my feet pigs start to fly jori turns out not to be gay mrs warfield is actually nice to scott chou luaren apologizes to david for beinga bitch mr myren comes out of retirement it seems all these odd things could happen if my best friend could once aain betray me like that I just didnt get how my best friend could do this to me. his response it just kind of happened errr that pissed me off i was like my fist pummeling your face is just gonna happen but he was my best friend and i promised myself that i would never let a girl get in between our good relationship as a friend i just couldnt believe that he could do this to me im over heather now and of course joey and heather are still going out strong it just evertime i c them kiss i remeber all the times i told joey about how much i cared for her and he just ignored it like whateva i say means nothing to him.  I hear so end my first journal and i just just remembered my password so all is good please post on what i should have done tommorow i so will tell you how i handle it and more deprressing notes on my life
