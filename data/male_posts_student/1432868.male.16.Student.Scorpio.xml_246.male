[Lies.] {The media.} Yes, another name for lies" - Mrs. Hare [Student] {Another student}    "Why is he drawing a butt on the board?" - Honors Physics student (When learning about angular velocity)  "Guys - extra help is a great place to meet girls. Of course, they're geek girls... but you're geek guys. That's how geeks meet and make little geeks... After marriage of course." - Mr. Richards   "I'll tell you which window my mother in law's is. You can throw in hand grenades." - Mr. Richards   "If I ask you for speed, what do you give me? No, not drugs." - Mr. Richards   "And when you stand, there will hopefully be applause. [Hopefully?] They will applaud. I paid a couple of people. That's what happens with your citrus money." - Mr. Levin [Violinist]    "Is the fuck- I meant to say 'Is the fuckle'- Is the fuclic that pickle? Is the public that fickle? There." - Mrs. Hare
