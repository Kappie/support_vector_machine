Those who divide everything into two, and those who don't.    Regarding change in Indonesia. I think there are two types of people. Those who care, and those who don't. Those who cares can also be divided into two ... the evolutionaries and the revolutionaries.    The revolutionaries are those who want change, and they want them now, now, now! They want to create breakthroughs, they want to  change the system . They want to throw out the president and put a new one in. Revolutionaries are usually young, independent people, full of spirit and idealism. They want change to happen before their very eyes.     On the other hand, the evolutionaries are those who want change to happen slowly. They feel secure that whatever they are doing (whatever it is) creates a difference. Evolutionaries believe that the system is good, and  working in the system  will benefit people. For them, change can happen in 10, 20, even 50 years, and it will happen. They're usually older people, who's been through a lot. They know that sudden change will likely hurt someone, and that's what they're trying to prevent. They've spent 30 years under the same president, what's another 10 bad years.     The conclusion? There are many ways of creating change. Don't be mad at someone if he doesn't share your enthusiasm for change, he may be an evolutionary. On the other hand don't be mad at someone if he creates radical changes, which may do a lot of damage. He's probably a revolutionary
