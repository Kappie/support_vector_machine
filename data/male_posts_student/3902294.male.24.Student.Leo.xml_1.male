I know this seems like a direct rip off of the Bible but keep in mind this is a rough draft and I will go back and modify it to change what exactly happened. I just wanted to get an outline down before I flesh it out.  'The "Life-Bringers", those created by the Creator, finished bringing the last of life to the land and for a time were satisifed as was the Creator.  For a great length of time,  there was a great peace  the Life-Bringers as well as all life living in the Realm.  However, this period of peace did not last as long as hoped by the Creator for a shadow from unknown source.   After the appearance of this darkness, several of the "Life-Bringers" began to talk and complain on how unfair they were being treated and soon begin crying that they deserve rule over the life and realm they created.    However, the Creator refused to surrender saying no one deserved to rule over the realm since all life in the realm were free  without a ruler, though it fell upon deaf ears.   Soon more "Life-Bringers" began to join those whole already beginning to speak of rebellion against the Creator. Soon fighting began amongst the "Life-Bringers" which broke out into an all-out war.  However, the Generals of the "Life-Bringers" were able to quickly to organize an army and fight the Rebellious Ones successfully.  On the verge of defeat, the Rebellious Ones retreated into the Realm before they were forced to surrender.  Upon landing in the "Realm" their forms changed to that of hideous horrible monsters yet the same lust for power and jealousy that forced them into the realm grew greatly.  They began to terrorize all life in the realm even attacking those "Life-Bringers" who had entered the realm before the rebellion and had taken on a form. They had no control over their emotions or actions, only the rage and lust for destruction that filled them when they fought against their fellow "Life-Bringers".  The cries of the life could be heard by the "Life-Bringers" who watched in horror as their creations suffered great pain and feeling this pain, they pleaded to the Creator to do something.  First, "Life-Bringers" were allowed to bring as much of the life on the realm to safety including those later known as the Ancient Clan as well as many others.  This was still not enough though as most of the life did not understand the "messengers" or were too frightened to leave.  Then it was allowed that many "Life-Bringers" could travel to the Realm to fight these Monsters and so they departed entering the realm.  Many of them took the form of the complex yet fragile lifeform of humans.  However, when they awoke from their journey, they were disoriented with no memory of where they had come from nor their purpose in being in the realm and were scattered across the land.   They wandered across the land and soon were by those of the Ancient Clan.  Though confused upon why they did not remember were they came from, they were accepted and allowed refugee in the Great Hall were they stayed for a time as the monsters continued to ravage the land'  Â© Roberto Marquez
