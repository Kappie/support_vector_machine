I'm willing to bet she was doing her stupid little victory dance while she talked to me. Ellen can be a little unprofessional, but we overlook it because she's good - about as good as they come. I was sure she'd do fine with the girl's parents, but that doesn't mean she'd be happy about it. So I got it out of the way pretty fast. Told her there was a complication; tried to explain, but of course she wouldn't hear it. "And there was no way you could have caught him alone!?! Greg, you moron, she could cause big waves. Suppose she goes and tells her parents, or the cops. Do you know who's gonna have to put out these fires, Greg? I'll give you a hint, it isn't you!" "Actually," I cut in, "I thought you could start on the fire thing now. We need to get to her parents somehow. You got the database handy?" "Yes," she seethed. "Same high school as Ian, first name Scarlett." "There's two." "Check the mugs. Red hair, she has a mole on her cheek." "Got it. I have tickets to a show tonight. If I miss it you're paying." Click. Well I looked at Marcus, and he looked at me and he finally said, in the stupid question of the year, "How'd it go?" "Well how'd you think it went? She's ballistic, but she'll be over it in an hour. We got anybody else on the list?" "Chip's taking care of the other guy, so that just leaves one thing." "Who? Where? I need the data man." And then he stopped walking. He looked at me in a funny way and he said. "Look, Greg, This is weird, but, it's you." "I'm being recruited?" "Yep." "But I'm a recruiter!" "Yep." "WHAT!?!" "C'mon Greg, you fit the profile. Dissatisfied with your job, but out of other options, little to no social life, --" "But I've already done this! It didn't work the first time! If this is your idea of a joke." "Greg, this is right from the top, you  will  be a recruit on this mission," he said gravely, "Here's your time and place. Don't wear the suit." And we just stood there, he and I. I couldn't believe this. Me. Recruited. Geez.
