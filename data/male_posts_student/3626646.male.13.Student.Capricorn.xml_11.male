Now, let's say a druggie (we'll call him Raul) wants to smoke some Vacuum Cleaner.  Before Raul can have some fun, he's going to have to vacuum his floor first.  It's like:  Raul has his buddies over and they're all sitting on the couch. Raul's all: "Hey man, I got some vacuum cleaner!" and Superfly's like: "Hey man, can I have some, man?" it's like: "No man, I was doin' stuff earlier, I gotta get it first!" his buddie's like: "What you gotta do, man?  Go in the garden and pick it?" Raul's like: "No man, I gotta vacuum!" He pulls out his vacuum and he puts on his apron and starts vacuuming. "Hey man, can you move your feet, man.  There's some dirt under you man!"   Just a thought!
