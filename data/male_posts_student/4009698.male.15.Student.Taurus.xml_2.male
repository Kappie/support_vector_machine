Ambrose has a 58 point advantage over Castrol Perkins Driver Steven Richards. The next Ford driver is Russell Ingall, who is on 808 points.  This means that if Ambrose gets disqualifyed, as he should have been after the Queensland 300, it would be like losing the edge over the feild. even a no result will puncture the blue oval's chances of back-to-back championships.  Look at Greg Murphy. He was right in with a shot heading into the Round 6 meet, but crashed on the first turn. He retired and therefore dropped 192 points to Ambrose.  In other words: if Ford lose Ambrose, They're screwed.
