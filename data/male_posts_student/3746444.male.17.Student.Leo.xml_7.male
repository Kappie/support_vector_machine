I don't know why God puts the nicest and most kind hearted people in this position all the time but he ends up doing it no matter what maybe it's to see if we can keep our beliefs and stay on track and hopefully he can see that no matter what life throws at us we will always stay true to what we believe. I know your hurting babe and you don't know how much I want to go over there and just let you cry on my shoulder but we can't just relize that no matter what I will always be here for. No matter what time of day, what I'm doing, or who I'm with you can always count on the fact that I will be here for.
