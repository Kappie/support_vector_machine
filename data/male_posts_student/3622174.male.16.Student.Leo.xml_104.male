Tomorrow, I have the first of my driving days, and it's going to be either a fun experience or a scary experience...depending on who's driving when.  I'm really nervous.  I think I'll do alright though.  Driving on I-75 in Ocala is something that I'm definitely just a bit nervous of.  I've only driven on a major highway like that once, and that was the Suncoast Parkway, and that's barely any traffic most of the time.  Tuesday, after drivers ed, I have a yearbook staff meeting.  Its gonna be weird seeing a lot of the people that I haven't seen in two months.  I feel so isolated, all up here in the countryside of The River.  I have a big house, why don't I throw a party sometime!  Something I wouldn't do...sorry.  The whole "my parents own two houses" thing is coming to an end, speaking of my house.  We finally sold our old house, and it closes tomorrow.  We haven't lived there for a whole year, and we had people living in it until last month, but, oh well.  Now I'll never have to go to The Town Below the River ever again.    And, that's it for now.  A storm is brewing, and is about to go right over me, so I'd better get this up before I lose my shitacular satellite connection!  I'll be back later with Late Night Bloggin' and something else, too.  Maybe some lyrics to another song.  Dunno.  But see you later!
