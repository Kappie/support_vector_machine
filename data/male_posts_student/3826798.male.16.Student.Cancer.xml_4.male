Not that i am sentimental over it, but hey! is 3re actually a need to flash the news about the death? i mean they are frantically ringing up everyone abt the Man's demise, apart 4rm ringing even publishing the fact in the News Paper.... i swear, the whole 'Rest in Peace' concept is to pieces when this is the deed behind life..   Death is inevitable for all and each 1 of us are heading for it, so its prety obvious that one of us is about 'Kick the Bucket' sooner or later, no matter how important that person is to you or not.....   i still don't get the need 4 the media hype...
