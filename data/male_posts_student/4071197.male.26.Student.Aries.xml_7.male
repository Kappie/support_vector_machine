It argues that one of the main reasons for centralization is cost reductions .  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * An example of companies that have decentralized data centers is KeyCorp. The most common approach to business intelligence is to assemble a team of developers to build a data warehouse or data mart for a specific project, buy a reporting tool to use with it, an d disassemble the team upon the project's completion. This however is like "reinventing the wheel," and such implementations can result in high development and support costs and incompatible buisness-intelligence systems throughout a company.  Some companies are taking a more strategic aproach: standardizing on fewer business-intelligence tools and making them available throughout their organizations even before projects are planned. The execute these strategies, companies are creating dedicated groups- sometimes called competency centers or centers of excellence - to manage business-intelligence projects and provide techincal and analytical expertise to other employees. These centers are ususally staffed with people who have a variety of technical, business, and data-analysis expertise, and the centers become a repository of business-intelligence related skills.  Again, cost reduction is often the driving factor for companies to create these centralized competancy centers to consolidate business-intelligence systems. Chris Amos, a reporting solutions manager at British Telecom says that standard technology and implementation practices can reduce the cost of some business-intelligence projects by up to 95%.  reference: Whiting, R.
