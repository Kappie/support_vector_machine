I remember a few years back when every week I would look forward to Friday night. I would get to go to the mall and hang out. Well, after 4 years of going to that horrible mall and seeing the same people for 4 years has done it's damage. And since there really isn't anything else to do in Hazleton on a Friday night except go to the mall or go to a movie. So here I am, at home, and content. Sad when I'd rather sit at home and do nothing. Oh well. This Friday was special. It was the last full day before Christmas vacation. Well it's about time. Eternal bliss will be granted to all the condemned children of Bishop Hafey. Well, 16 days of bliss but I'll take it. Anyway that's all for now. I'm going back to what I do best: Nothing.  Listen to H.I.M.
