Worse still, it rained. And lemme tell u, rain doesnt help to make ur mood any better. Yea, I went to pass Debbo e SS book...and hope it helps (her, i mean). Came home, dinner, and back to work. Rawr, yes, it is horrendously boring. Cheryl spoke to me on msn. Wow. Yea, it's been like...a month or so since we ever spoke a word? Yea, something like that. Maybe it's me or smth, but I can't seem to find anything to talk to her about. I don't noe...it's just...yea. Her msn nick is flowers in the window. I noe that song. She wrote me that song's lyrics once...some time ago. Yea, and things were...ok, nvm that. Anywae, a new week's starting. Yepp, at least that is something to look forwards to, and the olympics is on. Hope China does well...hehe. Yea...I guess i'd get back to work. Sign. It is boring today.
