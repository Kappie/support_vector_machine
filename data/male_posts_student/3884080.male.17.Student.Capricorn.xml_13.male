Theres nothing going on at all! i have to work tomorrow and sunday 5-11 and i dont want to, i hate those shifts, and i bet ill have to work with my bitch manager, grrrrr i hate her, she sucks.  My neck still hurts but it doesnt hurt bad so thats good. Last night everyone played a great game of lava! i was so sweaty when it was done, everyone said it was the best one yet so that was a good game.  Hahaha last night me and shane went to lustig park and saw to people having sex in the woods right next to the road and we stopped the car and i asked the guy how to get to arbys (at this point they were doing it doggy style, he had his penis in her vagina and they were going strong) and he gave us directions! haha he gave us directions while they were having sex, it was the funniest thing ever, they didnt stop or even looked shocked. haha  Im very bored so im going to go finish installing things on the computer.    I love how my life is going :)
