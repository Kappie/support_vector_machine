I dont have any tests to do, and my exam... well, I'll take the late exam. -.-*  According to the VP those who don't have tests or exams should go home and make sure they're on track. HA! Like that'll ever happen. I was invited to the movies, but I doubt I'll be allowed to go out three times in one week...  Ah yes, Sunday is Emerson's birthday party! (#1) That'll be fun! *puts on glasses and smiles evilly* Or will it?  So, on Saturday I will be going with Von and Rei to mall to get gift! (#2) That still hasn't been planned properly yet... And there'll have to be some stuff bought for international night...  *goes back one step* Yes, so you see why if I went out with friends today, it'd be three times this week. Meh... at least I get to stay home and... *blinks* Vacuum??? *sigh* lol  I'll watch X! ^-^ I might be able to finish the series... and if Angelfire is friendly today I might be able to upload episode 23 for Maureen.  Well, off to finish vacuuming! Ja ne!  -ArV    Changed the links on the left side so that they'll open in a new window.  Thinking of playing with the colours... White seems very bright, either that or my eyes are extra sensitivte today...
