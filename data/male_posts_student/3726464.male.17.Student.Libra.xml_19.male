The way I wake up thinking of you and the way I go to sleep dreaming of you  Love is... The way you look deep into my eyes and then smile softly  Love is... The way you call me, "your baby" those two words make my heart beat faster  Love is... The way you comfort me when I'm down  Love is... The way a bad day can turn into good when I'm thinking of you  Love is... The way you smile... just that, can lighten my day  Love is... The way I feel when I'm around you, I'm protected from everything  Love is... The way you kiss me... the world stops just for those few minutes of pure pleasure  Love is... The way you hug me... so warm and gentle  Love is... The way I see other couples together and I'm wishing you were here with me  Love is... The way the tears fall when I know I'm not going to see you  But at least I know I have you and that you love me  ..and that's all that matters.
