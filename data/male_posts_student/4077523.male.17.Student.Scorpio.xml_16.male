I am pretty tired, I wasn't able to sleep late like I hoped. I don't really have much to say as of now but I will try to post later. Well i'm gonna to so C-ya.     Update: Hey i'm back just got back from servicing the machines and getting a bank account. Fun, Fun, I know. I'm just sitting here watching T.V. being bored. Anywho, i'll update again later.     2nd Update: Whats up? I just got back from church band practice. I not only play tuba for school but the baritone for church. Anyway, i'm just sittin here talkin to some friends, and makin a few e-mails, so i'll ttyl. Peace!
