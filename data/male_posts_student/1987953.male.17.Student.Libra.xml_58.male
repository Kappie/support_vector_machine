Becky, the assistant manager at Wendy's (the cool manager) found a way to keep me there longer. I was trying to become a crew chief. They found incentive for temporary dedication (until maybe the end of the summer) by showing their intent in making me a crew chief when they ordered my gold plated name tags! They look so nice! I want to wear them! I also want the raises for crew chief and evaluation. I'll be at $7.60/hr by the summer! I think I'm probably going to stay and leave after the summer, which means I'll be there a year and three months! That's too long! I never meant to be there past December!  Anyway, gotta go! Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >    You Found Me , by FFH  (Read these lyrics. I'm posting the full song soon! I've got nowhere to turn,  I've got nowhere to hide,  And I've got no alibi, You've been following me,  You know my history,  And no matter how hard I try, I can't explain away The way I feel today There's only one thing I can say:  (Chorus) You, You found me. You found me and You called me from the wilderness, From my cave of emptiness, Yeah, You, You found me. You found me in the places of my lonliness You told me there was more than this, You captured me with tenderness, Yeah, You found me.  There was so many days,  Trying to figure out ways,  To explain what I feel inside, I tried to fill up my soul without loosing control,  This desire never did subside, I'm ready to give in I know I'll never win The hide and seek that I've been in  (Chorus) You, You found me. You found me and You called me from the wilderness, From my cave of emptiness, Yeah, You, You found me. You found me in the places of my lonliness You told me there was more than this, You captured me with tenderness, Yeah, You found me.  In the pit of despair, I was all alone there. I wasn't looking for You, but You found me anyway. You put Your hand on my face, then you changed my ways. Nothing can separate me from...  (Chorus) You, Cause You found me. You found me and You called me from the wilderness, From my cave of emptiness, Yeah, You, You found me. You found me in the places of my lonliness You told me there was more than this, You captured me with tenderness, Yeah, You found me.
