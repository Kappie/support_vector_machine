First, she's way out of his league, maybe he can charm her enough to convince her to give him a chance, but I'm not sure. I don't know her very well because she is afraid to talk to me because I "scare" her with my size. This leads me to believe that she's kind of shallow. Tim is as well though, so I'm not sure what to make of this. He's already asked her out to the movies, and as I see it, she turned him down lightly by saying that she "doesn't like the movies". Since this He has reportedly sent her $80 worth of flowers, and has big plans to take her out on an extravagant date. Here's the plan: Start out by taking her to breakfast at IHOP, then taking her to Six Flags for the day. At Six Flags he will pay for her admition, any food, drink, games, or souvenirs that she desires. At the end of the day the plan is to take her to a nice restaurant (ie: Gumbo's downtown) where he will let her get whatever she wants off the menu, and he will pick up the tab. Although it is a nice gesture to do this for her, keep in mind that this is their first date. In my eyes he's trying to impress her more with his money more than a charm and personality. I know many girls that would rather see how much the guy cares for her than have him blow hundreds of dollars trying to impress her. Tim, like I said, you have my full support, but please take what I have said into consideration. I hope this helps Tim, and maybe some others, listen to my words of wisdom (although I have never had a girlfriend, I've done a lot of thinking, and questioning). Till next time..... I have nothing else to say.
