Just wanted to get one last little post in before the clock tells me its Wednesday and you need to be up in 6 hours (not that I'd listen to it; who listens to a clock!?). Anyhow, I've met to cool people via this blog: Mark and Justin. Both of them are on my "Frequently Read Blog" list, and both are very cool people. Hi guys!  General "Note-To-Self" (from Justin): Look up the book "A Destiny of Souls" by Christopher Rice.
