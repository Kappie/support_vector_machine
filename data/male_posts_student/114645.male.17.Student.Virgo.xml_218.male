I got a couple new books on Saturday. I got  JackBoot: A History of the German Soldier 1713 - 1945  and  The Order of the Death's Head, The Story of Hitler's SS . They both seem quite interesting. I have read so much of  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix . I am on Chapter 23, which is good for me, being that it took me 4 months to read  The Presence of My Own Company  which is only like 150 pages.  But yeah. I should be finishing Harry Potter sometime this week then I can start  JackBoot  or  The Order of the Death's Head . I wonder how big my file is with the FBI or Homeland Security. Think about it. How much have I dissed Bush, Ashcroft, the US Government, plus I support Kerry, and I have just posted online that I am reading books about Nazi Germany. Oh well. Who knows. That is all for now.
