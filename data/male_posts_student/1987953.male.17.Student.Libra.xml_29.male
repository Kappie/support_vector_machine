We got some cool stuff for the loved ones in our lives. Somehow, I was able to get two things for Brittany WITH HER THERE! Amazing, huh? I know, you're asking, "How did you do it?" All I can say is, "I am very very sneaky, sir." (From the butler on  Mr. Deeds ) During lunch I bought one and was able to hide it and she didn't find out what it was, and the other I bought when she was away from me for even 20 seconds. (Think Britt, think!) I have so much fun being very very sneaky! Oh well. I got her four things (or technically three the way you look at it). DUDE! I'm good! I'm not being egotistical! I just know how to be honest! Comment me: How is your Christmas shopping coming? Please comment! Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >   urlLink Hear this song!  "It's the time to show the world we're strong, we won't be terrorized. Evil's not allowed to win when you've got Heaven on your side. It's for the ones we've lost that we stand up strong today, 'cause the flag still stands for freedom, and they won't take that away.  And we're standing strong as Americans, where at least we know we're free, And we won't forget the ones who died on that Tuesday morning. And we're going to stand up and see it through and defend her still today. Cause we'll never fall when we all stand. God bless the USA!" -Lee Greenwood's Sept. 1th version of  "God Bless The USA"
