Thanks to the Einstein of BB, Joel Lim, I am introduced to have a kind of useless but interesting blog to be read by everyone! If you want to remember the wonderful memories which will happen in the future that happens in 4C, the skool or anywhere, remember to look here! I hope I have time to update this... ( Joel, remind me ok? ) and well, that's all for now! See ya again!
