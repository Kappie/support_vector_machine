This is a place where I feel fairly safe, away from the constant mocking and ridicule that would undoubtably follow was I to allow my so called 'friends' to read this.  It is for this reason that this is the one and only place where I will  ever  allow my personal feelings to be told to the world. Just goes to show my complete stupidity how I could have easily kept my profile anonymous.  But on contemplation on this matter I've come to realise how much I would  really  like my 'friends' to know how much I hate each and every one of them.  So much so, in some cases that I would gladly kill them if given the chance.  It is things like the above that I will post here and here only.  I doubt any of my friends will ever find this website and if they do, who cares?  It's the truth after all.  Just a word of warning, you may find some of my ideas and opinions unusual or insulting, if so don't bother complaining to me because I don't care.  Another warning for the religious out there who may be reading, I advise you read no further, lest you find out how much of an idiot I think you are.  Expect poetry, ramblings and down right angry ranting about anything that concerns me but I can't speak my mind about to anyone other than you the reader.
