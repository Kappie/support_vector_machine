"how you feeling mike?".. "whats wrong mike?".. "can you come do this and that mike?"..  i dont know .. the dang doctors dont know anything either so once again its all in your head mike.. dont argue with me mike you arent a dr mike you dont know whats going on but i know so much more bc just bc im older and have been through it.. there is a reason you dont wanna do what the dr told you to do mike but i dont know what mike.. you have always done what the dr has said mike.. always mike you do what the dr says.. but we dont know whats wrong with you mike but youll be okay if you do this this this and of coarse this till we can try and run some more tests and do this this this and this eventually and in the mean time do this this this and this cause im a doctor this is what i get paid the big bucks for.. ..   STOP!  .. Give it time it will go away. If it comes back it comes back. I want to go back to what I know as normal. I'm sick of people asking me and acting like they're worried because  I'm  not because crap with me  always  goes away. I'm not trying to be difficult with all of this but I'm just wanting to live again. I want to go back to Six Flags... I want to drive.. all that stuff. Nothing is as bad as it usually appears in the eyes of the parents who are the first to get you checked out but at the same time hopeing nothing is wrong. I'm sick of all this so no more. People are way more worse off then little ole me so why complain or even talk about it? I'm breathing. More then some people can say. I have incredible friends..  best friends  for the first time in my life I can say that and know the love is there in return. I'm done and I don't think anything can change my mind at this point either.. Nobody get mad at this post and post anything in the comments cause there is nothing to talk about here. Period.
