I really want the following CD's lately...     Beastie Boys : To The 5 Boroughs (note: got it recently)   Soundtrack : Kill Bill Vol. 1   Soundtrack : Kill Bill Vol. 2   Soundtrack : The Bourne Supremacy  I'm listening to "To The 5 Boroughs" right now, praticularly "Ch-Check It Out". Yeah. I'm doing well as a trial member of -)RR(-. Yeah. Oh, something that  actually  that has to do with the GH: I'm seriously thinking about turning it into a printed paper. Lots of stuff has to get sorted out between all of us, especially if we're gonna recruit some people to make it easier, and if it's gonna be weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. (I personally would like to do it bi-weekly.) Um... Yeah. I gotta go. Oh, and Fred's gonna be gone a while, and Max is still in Minnesota I think. Yeah. Well, see ya. Or contact me. Yeah. Au revoir.
