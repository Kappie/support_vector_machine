There's a constant fight to gague what I'm doing in relation to how the world runs, and the more I see that I'm making a significantly pathetic difference in the scheme of things.  The most productive thing I have done for society in over a month is give a homeless man $2 to buy some breakfast.    There's an inherent pressure in the screenwriting program to produce scripts, to produce saleable scripts, and to produce four of them by the time we leave here.  I currently own two completed feature-length scripts, as well as several shorts and the beginnings of at least nine features.  I am willing to let people see one of the shorts.  One of the features is good, but it is currently in the shop getting fixed, and I'm only back to page 7 on it.    So I sit in a Starbucks, finished with my box of organic chocolate milk, sipping on a water, ready to go to Bed Bath and Beyond to look for shelving and desks, and trying to figure out how to solve the world.  It's no more specific than that...the world is broken, and I want to fix it.  The fear is that I might not.    But what is exciting is that, no matter how much I try to bring myself to say it, I can't say that  I won't fix the world .  Because I don't believe that.  I think I can.    At Showdown a few nights ago, Maggie and I talked about the post-college existence, and she off-handedly mentioned that she is finished trying to save the world, and now she's just going to try to do her thing as best she can.  Which is fair.  It's what we all do.  We go through high school graduation...the valedictorian gives a nervous speech with words like  asinine  and  conjecture , finishes it with a bit about saving the world, and then we take pictures with girls whose bodies we used as science experiments before starting off on  The Real World .    Angela Potochnik, in her 1998 valedictorian speech at Rogers High School, said something that sticks with me today:   Every year, graduates stand on this platform and profess their want to save the world.  But none have.  Let's be the ones to do it.     I sat in the bleachers, listening, dressed better than most of the people I came with.  And as the band kicked back into Pomp and Circumstance, as Dan Wearsch shunned me and Jerromy and the Daniel's for his high school friends, and as random graduates who I knew in 1997 but didn't recognize in 1998 came up to me with Kodak Fun Savers and suddenly had arms around me and lips on my cheek, I looked for Angela.  I wanted to ask her why she never gave me a chance to save the world.  I'd only had one year.    I've had six and a half now.  And I'm still working on it.
