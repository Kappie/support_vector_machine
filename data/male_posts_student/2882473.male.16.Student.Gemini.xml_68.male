I think I knew the answer to just about every question, and if not I gave a good guess. Come on A*... I got an A* in the mocks in December, so if I get very lucky... Well, chemistry tomorrow. The extension. That will be far from fun. I've barely even looked at the chemistry section in the additional sciences revision guide, so I best do plenty of that this afternoon and tonight. Of course I say that and I probably won't do much, but oh well. I'll do a little. Who wants to do that when I could be doing something much more fun like... like... errr learning Esperanto! Of course, that's much more fun! Right? Well, I think it's fun. A bit. I tried a bit last night, and I think I have a vocabulary of about 20 words, which is fairly good for one night, I think. So, I have learnt a few basic sentences, such as: Patro trinkas teon - Father drinks tea. Patro trinkis teon - Father drank tea. Patro trinkos teon - Father will drink tea. It's a nice easy language to learn, so hopefully by the end of the summer, I will have progressed quite a bit. If you're interested,  urlLink this site  is where I've been learning it from. I think you're supposed to have some sort of teacher helping you on it, but I haven't bothered with any of that. Anyway, yes, I know I  should  be revising, but that's boring.  Well, as I said, chemistry is tomorrow so I best go and revise for it soon.  That's about all for now. Bye for now.   Weather:  Nice day, sunny, a few clouds.   Reading:  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  Listening to:  Animaniacs - Nations of the World. It's actually very good. Ask me if you want it.  Watching:  Nowt  Confused about:  Current in transformers  Annoyed with:  chemistry  Mood:  About the same as normal
