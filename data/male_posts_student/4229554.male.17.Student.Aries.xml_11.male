It is so hard to not grab her, so hard to not confess: "I want To Place My Lips on Yours!" "I want you to touch me." "I want you to hold my hand." Are such things so horrendous to want, am I evil to want to feel her next to me. To slowly lay my lips upon her freckles and hear her breath change with each touch? She I fear, is the reason me and anna could not work. I fear such silly things sometimes, maybe this is nothing? I cannot tell, for I feel her looks, and I know her heart hears me. But the mind, the simple need to reason gets the best of her. I pray for a better tomorrow, one were I may understand this. This just feels so haunting, I constantly see images of her skin, each freckle, her neck...in fact it is far to much of a distraction...
