At first I didn't know how well the Cze played so I thought to myself that the Dutch could bag aother draw or hopefully a win. I was wrong. It was a 2-3 lose to Holland. But goals are goals, 2 shots went in, I'm proud. Wilfred Bouma, our first Dutch scorer did well as Ruud follows to score the second goal.
