Dude that thing was such self-orientalizing and horrible use of stereotypes. Indeed it might be satire, but having that sort of depiction of race on a channel were most viewers are retards is just scary. I really hope what they showed on TV isn't the only thing that he raps about, because if it is then he's part of the problem of misrepresentation. Anyway it's late and I'm not gonna go into a super long rant about how annoying what I saw was.  It's Xmas and I'm listening to Joe Strummer.  ***
