But now its fair because I'm bigger than everyone. Good food........ Good people.... Played poker.. took everyone's money. Just chillin and shit... I like that.  Yesterday was cool too.. spent the day with Dianne. Paul and Thuy came over to play games... we didn't play anything and watched movies. Collateral was good.. funny though cuz it extracted weird.. think the file's corruted... but i had to do it like 3 times.. and we missed out on like the last 2 minutes.. but that's ok.. Then the other cousin came over... and something happened that will change my life forever...  Ever here of Veet????? That stupid shit for shaving ur legs!!! Omg. They used me as the guinea pig... and it turned out it didn't work very well.. And my leg was all fucked up and weird.. so i had to shave it all off.... But, iono.. my legs are kinda nice and smooth now. Feel kinda sassy and shit.. HAHA!!! Don't make fun!  That's All for right now... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.
