Rants : I hate the fucking service around here. I have a problem with my net, we call the company, and they tell us “disconnect the power supply in five minutes”. That’s the remedy they have for EVERY problem. CUNTS.   Rambles : Whenever I have nothing of flavour to write, I just post characters I’ve written up. This next one is… Fucked…  Name: Roland Age: Twenty-Four Race: HumanSex: MaleKingdom: Libaterra Class: Brahmarishi of Odd Weaponry Weapon: There are those who would use a sword against you, and those who would use a bow. Roland has never liked such things, thinking them too refined for his tastes. The weapon he’s best known for is his own body, and is deftly accomplished with it. They say he can fracture walls with his groin alone (PELVIC THRUST). However, if he is feeling kind, he will pick up whatever is around him and use that. Once he beat somebody to death with an ice cube for calling him a pervert.  Innate magic ability: The Brahmarishi of Odd Weaponry is chosen once every five centuries, and this trade is one that is branded within the very blood. So, when Roland was born, they knew he was the next Brahmarishi due to his uncanny ability to make women’s bras pop open with his glance. A very notable facility, wouldn’t you say? Physical description: Roland is hardly muscular in his build, and is better called lank. Of course appearances are deceiving, and until you actually try and put a blow unto his body will you believe how truly powerful he is.  He is shaved completely bald, and is devoid of hair (that’s what bald means!) on his head, eyebrow hair, nasal hair, anal hair, pubic hair, and so forth. This is the way of the Brahmarishi, for only a true Brahmarishi could take the continuous shaving of his body.  For clothes, the Brahmarishi may only wear three articles of clothing. First there is the compulsory, black fedora hat. Then there is the towel of everlasting wear, which is fastened around Roland’s waist and can only be dropped by Roland himself. Finally there are the groovy sandals of dance that the Brahmarishi must don. These sandals allow Roland to pull off complex dance moves such as the Moonwalk. Why? Who cares? Character description: Roland thinks of himself as a living God, and he has every right too. Because of this, however, he rarely finds companionship. One-night stands, yes, but not camaraderie. They say even cats cannot stand his stuck-up attitude. Because of this, Roland is forced to find amity with items such as beer and drugs, neither of which apparently screws up his body system. Will he find friends in the upcoming adventure? Stay tuned. Background info: Roland was born in Somewhere, Libaterra. The small village of Somewhere is unknown to most people because most people are retards. Anyway, for millennia, even before Libaterra came into existence (how the fook is this possible), the people of Somewhere had always been the chosen clan to carry on the title of Brahmarishi of Odd Weaponry . There is something to be said about the clan of Somewhere however. They are a people who breed off each others. Yes, you heard me. They’re like rednecks.  Anyway, Roland was born in the Somewhere year of the Gallivanting Prairie Dog. As mentioned earlier, he was chosen as Brahmarishi after popping his twenty-year-his-elder sister’s bra wide open. As was Somewhere tradition, his sister gave her breasts to him for feeding, because Somewhere tradition dictated that whoever’s bra was popped open was the one to feed the chosen one. One note of mention, Roland’s sister is hot.  By ten, Roland had finally gotten over the whole breastfeeding stage, and he was ready for training. Unfortunately, the Brahmarishi pretty much just has to re-learn his skills rather than learn them anew. So yeh, Roland had everything figured out in a month of time. It was like riding a bicycle. So he went back to breastfeeding.  But, alas, his sister had grown tired of the constant nourishment that her brother sought, and so she knocked him over the head, threw his body over a mule, and slapped the ass’s arse.  When Roland finally awoke, he found himself in Trinity Gask. Furthermore, he found that the women of Trinity Gask liked the “suckling of the breasts” and so he managed to live very well off.  Due to a very lazy writer, we’re going to skip to recent times. When Yamoto decided to drag their foreign buttocks into Libaterra, Roland knew his calling had finally come, and he stopped with the breastfeeding.  So now he goes around in his mighty towel, sandals, and fedora hat looking to heal the world. Make it a better place. For you and for me and the entire human race. Yes, I just had to rip off Jacko.   My Service to God : Because Annisa so kindly asked, I’m going to translate Yoshi’s last blog entry to the Queen’s English. Only because I can’t go in, figure out his password, and edit it myself.  “God, we have to stay at school Friday afternoon?” That was what was in my mind when I got Annisa’s SMS. Well I tried being innocent and pretended that I never got the SMS by not replying to it but the entirety of my biology class reminded me. So yesterday I stayed at school to finish my bio poster.  It was quite fun staying with Angel, Monita, Annisa and Mike, but GOD the girls kept ordering me to get stuff from the resource room. Didn’t they know I had sore legs because of the PE class the day before? Well it seems like they just liked torturing me by ordering me to get stuff from the resource room (which, for me, seemed miles away due to my sore legs). So, after a while, I just gave up. The next time they told me to get something, I rejected their order. Well I guess by doing that I made somebody mad. After the girls tried ordering me to get the UHU glue, Angel got up and took it herself, and when she came back she muttered something about how easy it was to get something. Well, HELLO, I HAD SORE LEGS HERE! After we finished the work, I apologised to Angel, and she said she wasn’t angry at me. Oh well.
