Now I can join the league of arty photo-takers who post seemingly abstract shots on their blogs like  urlLink tess  and  urlLink jon   *grins*  . All I have to do is to find someplace to host the photos and link them to here.  Another league I believe I can officially be a part is the gadget freaks. I mean take a glance at the list: mobile phone, MP3 player, Sony PDA and digital camera...I'm practically a Harvey Norman. And one would think my level of "geek" couldn't get any higher. Guess I just "leveled" up ( *heh*  another geek reference).  Well, we can look at it in two ways. On one hand, it fits in with my future line of work in IT. I would need to be familiar with the product in order to properly advice and troubleshoot for people, and what best way to get to learn about than to actually own and use it?   And the other end is that, perhaps I will take it up as a real hobby and more time will be spent outdoors and away from my desk and computer. Goes well with my new bicycle that I just got now that I'm starting to learn how to cycle finally after all these years.  Whichever the outcome,  it's all good .
