As i rolled out of bed i seriously considered muttering a string of profanities to express my extreme discomfort. i took a warm shower,that really felt like it should last forever, was instantly cut short, remembering i had to be at work oh so soon. i finished getting ready and took of for work. it was still dark out. i was still mad. still angry. and still wishing i was at home in my warm bed waiting for my body to wake up on its own.  but then....  i was driving down brookwood when i seemingly found "inner peace" in the morning's tranquility. i was no longer upset. and all other problems that had been, even from previous days, faded and all i could focus on was the road in front of me and the dark black empty sky that continued on to forever. a total of 2 cars were on the road that i saw on my way to coffeerush. they both added to my contentment and as i passed them i imagined their own sense of serenity.   i stepped out of my car once i got into that parking lot, the air felt crisp and fresh and cool, and i felt prepared to take on the day, roll with the punches, and laugh at life's attempts to bring me down.  and now finally at the end of the day, from waking up so early, at 11:13 on a summer night, when most kids are just beginning their nights, i am so exhausted that i am going to sleep right now. but this is not a bad thing. i am excited to crawl into my bed, let my head hit the pillow, sort out the days events in my head, and drift into that place where everything just seems to fade away.    and then tommorow will begin. a new day, a new day.   g'night folks.
