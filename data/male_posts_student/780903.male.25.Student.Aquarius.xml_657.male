The last section on the page is labeled "Odd Balls."  Ignoring the fact that I believe "oddball" is actually one word, not two, I thought I'd post four of them that I found especially unnerving to contemplate:  1. My license plate says “TRIAL”.  What would yours say?  WRONG ANSWER: "Unemployed."  2. If you won the lottery tomorrow, would you still be in law school?   WRONG ANSWER: "Yes, but I wouldn't be interviewing for a job at this firm."  3. Your resume says you speak French.  Let’s conduct this interview in French.  WRONG ANSWER: "Si, senor."  4. If you found out you had 24 hours to live, how would you spend them?   RIGHT ANSWER: "Checking footnotes on a journal article."
