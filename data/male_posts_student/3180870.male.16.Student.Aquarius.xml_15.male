To start up a version of PacManhattan in Arizona. After pouring through their site, hanging onto every entertaining word I've been wondering how I've survived all sixteen years of my life without this. I'm completely serious when I say "We have to do this, now." So all of you, check out PacManhattan's website (http://www.pacmanhattan.com/) and give me some feedback so we can do some recruiting and while you're on the computer check  out this artist Better Than Ezra (credit to my broskey). At least download the songs "At The Stars" and "King of New Orleans." I'm constantly told that my entries on here are completely random, which I think is absurd, but if they didn't think that, they wouldn't read it so think whatever you want, all I want are the site hits. Just kidding.  I just set up a new blog, my photo one. Since everyone else is doing it, why not? Check out and you can get there if you go to my link section on the right and click on "my photo blog."  Ever have the feeling to write down a musician's lyrics so everyone else can read them? I've just finished listening to every Better Than Ezra song I have and in each one, I wanted to share some of this guy's lyrics. But I won't because it would be stupid to do that, so you'll just have to hear them for yourself.
