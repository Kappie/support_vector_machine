I believe we were waitin for some stupid show to come on, probably Elimidate. As you may or may not know, before the time slot that used to (and I guess, may still) be Elimidate, is a show called Wired. There was a man on the television that night. A man dressed in a suit and playin an accordion. He sang, too. Some of the most beautiful lyrics I had ever heard. I fell in love instantly with the music of  urlLink  Geoff Berner    Last night, I had the opportunity to see Mr. Berner play a live show at the Vat in Red Deer. All I could do was sit there in awe as he picked up his accordion, and I could barely pull my eyes away from him or listen to anything but the sound of his voice and those amazing words for the entire set. Great show...  Some lyrics:  urlLink   Clown and Bard     Her grandfather opened the trust fund In a Baltimore account, But she was six months in the Paris of the Eastern Block By the time it ran out. I met her in that filthy basement Where a fat man ran the bar, and she said "If you're gonna drink that green stuff, you got to light it on fire."  I guess she knew me pretty well Despite the questions that I ducked 'Cause she said, "You'll like it here, Prague is like a Disneyland For the terminally fucked. But it don't fool me cause I can see All this beauty's just a trap set to kill." Then she grabbed my hand tight, said "Let me show you the lights From the top of the hill."  I don't know why I find the leaving so hard I'm so down, Hanging around At the Clown and Bard.  Oh the water in that river's as dirty as the cops, But it shines so pretty at night, That when I held her head as she puked absinthe Off the Charles Bridge, It was a tender and a glamourous sight. We kept up the charade just as long as we could, 'Til I had to get back in the van. She said "I'd like to come with you, But I'm saving up for Baltimore Just as soon as I can..."  Chorus  When I got back into town she wasn't hard to track down, Though they'd moved her down a couple of floors. Cold and half-dead on the un-made bed, Trying to squeeze the speed out through her pores. I offered to buy her a one way back state side, But I cried, begged, pleaded in vain She said "I don't think that I have an urge to die, I really just can't explain"..  Chorus.     see, amazing     By the way, I've moved. http://t-waldo.diaryland.com
