I'm thinking way too long range, I've already got Junior year planned out. This summer is gonna suck, that's why.  I can feel it. Sure I get to see the cousins and all, but that's not gonna float me forever.  I'll come up with something to do.  Maybe listen to myself, and stop hiding behind all those jokes.  Wow, that was pure Gnostic moment.  Anyway.  Black Nationalism. Afro-Centrism.  Black Radical.  All that is the Deadprez board.  It is so seriously bad for my health to fill my mind with that type of crap over the summer.  I mean, I turned a socialist last summer from reading too much weird stuff.  Okay, I've fallen off topic.  I'd make an entry into my Gospel, but considering no one understands it, and I'm lazy right now I don't feel like writting another entry.
