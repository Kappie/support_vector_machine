They have encounter a few problems but are pretty much on schedule. The temperature in Greece at the moment is reaching about 37c during the day, basteds. Went to a "universities fair" at the UEA yesterday and just picked up a pile of prospectuses (although I still have my heart set on Kent) and some free stuff too like pens and a mini inflatable chair. Had an pocket draining few days: I was borrowing mum and dads TV in my room and when I decided to move it the aerial socket came out along with the coax, so I though ahh, and took it up to Postles in Aylsham to see if they would fix it, the gimps said it would not be ready until Tuesday (mum and dad are back on monday) and would cost me Â£25 (not including VAT) just to look at it so I came back home (after luging this TV into aylsham and back) and phoned Chris so I could use his soldering iron, that was a mistake because in the end I just coverd the hole with solder and made it completly un-usable and un fixable, so I came to the conclusion that because the SCART still worked the only choise I had was to either give them my freeview box or buy a new one. So in the end I brought a new one (which I kept) and gave them my old one and hope they wont be to mad when the get back, but they should be Ok about it as they now can just work it. Got your email: Hey guys

Hope you are well and your exams tailed off to a great finish! I've just returned from a week of sail training which was amazing. F-in hard work, really cold, force 6 winds at least, rough sea - therefore inducing mush sickness..... mmmm nice, vomit colour there! However after 2 days of throwing up, i got my sea legs and over the voyage we covered 550 miles from the west coast of scotland to Lewis, then to the group of islands called Orkney. Damn good fun and i r now a proper sailer, innit. Well, i'm now off on expedition into the Cairn Gorms, 16hours after returning from Cruise and I feel like shite. But hey, it's a hard knock life.

What have you dudes been up to latley? Since last week, the IT fuckers have completely blocked blogger.com  blogspot, so i can't even read your board till I get off campus in a week.

My exams went ok i think, I could ever be sure about Biology though, its such a ridiculous subject and you never know exactly what they want from you in an answer. Plus so much that we learnt, we weren't tested on, bastards!!! Chem was ok and Maths, the best I can hope for is not great, but I never was great with numbers. Did you know that it is official that the ability to 'count' is not a requirement for A-Level Maths! Crazy.

Anywho, must go and pack now, have 2 hours to departure and have not started yet. Take care everyone and I'll be in touch in a week or so. I go on tour on thr 5th July and return to Norfolk around the 17th. Take care all

Love R

 
The sailing to the Orkney isles sounds fantastic I'm very jelous. I also realise you probably cant read this so I suggest when you do you grab the nearest wooden spoon and shove it so far up the IT geeks dandruff covered, pale arses and forsably unblock Blogger, they might as well block Google, BBCi, Hotmail and every other popular site. Hey maybe if you don't need to count for A level maths then I should give it a go because I have real trouble with that :). I suppose its like not needing to go near a computer to complete GNVQ IT (its just glorified letter writting after all). Good Luck on tour. My brother is comlaining constantly about AHS, Proffeser Mitchel has enforced cameras in each classroom (1984 anyone?) and they say they cant even afford batteries for our precious clocks :(, well maybe that what its like Back To The Future.
Anyway laters Girls, looks likes Sams contribution of two very short posts and one comment is all he can manage(no offence Sam). Alex
