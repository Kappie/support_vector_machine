I hope we succeed and get places, and eventually get to record and make some cd's. How do you do that? say cd's or cds...tell me how...or tell me why aint nothin but a heart beat. Nothing else happened, I'm just really lazy, and I have to do my homework. I also have to frickin go to the library before school tomorrow to finish some AP Euro project. Life sucks. Bye. Actually, no bye. I just thought of an excellent idea. When I'm finally done doing this blogger thing which won't be for a while, I shall print it all out and make a book out of it for good old memories and keep it forever. Hurray.
