Today was carried over from last night's late night partying and Tyke slept until about 11:30 which really was way before Tyke was expecting to get up.  So he is pretty tired now.  He got about 9 and a half hours.  Which for Tyke isn't that much.  He could sleep much more.  When he got up he set up a bball game at the Comm Center.  Tyke, Skippy, Piggy J, DCups, Jew, Jeu, all played along with others as well.  Tyke was on fire as usual.  He owns at the comm cent.  He dominated when he tried and his team never lost in fact no matter who was on it.  Not to brag, but Tyke was playing well.  Piggy J brought his littlest brother and he played some and on one play Jew just let him drive then came up and just absolutely swatted the shot out of the air.  It was hilarious!  There were quite a few fun plays.  Tyke had another good dunk attempt.  He went up and missed the dunk but he thinks he actually dunked it.  It was like when an NBA player goes up for a dunk (or a college player like the one who missed a dunk for Kansas today) and they can easily dunk but they miss it and it bounces off the back rim and out.  That is how Tyke dunked it.  Pretty good for him.  He was excited.  Or maybe he made it.  Now he is thinking he made it.  Hmmm...he knows he didn't dunk it but...oh whatever.  Tyke's probably the only one who cares about his dunking escapades.  But it was fun nonetheless.  Afterwards Tyke came home and that was his day.  Well he went to South Cove to drop off Team Jeu and then he drove around there for a little to see if anyone he was friends with was out.  Purdy wasn't home he doesn't think and he didn't feel like calling Tina even though he saw her car outside her house.  So Tyke went home.  He watched bball and ate and played PS2 and then his dad came home with KFC.  So he ate that.  And it was good.  Tyke and Kinker played poker online at night and they dominated.  Kinker really owned though.  He was up so much.  Tyke still had about 14k in his pocket when he left.  Oh yeah, play money.  Not real.  Tyke is still under age anyway.  Not Kinker.  He's old.  He's like 30.  He's gonna need a cane to walk with soon cuz he's so old.  Tyke is listening to 'All by Myself' right now.  That's such a good song.  It is so him.  And the song isn't so much sad and whining about being by himself (although really it is) but it's just like "don't wanna be all by myself!"  Yeah, don't worry bout Tyke, stuff's fun.  But...nah, we'll leave it at that.  Tomorrow is going to be great.  Broom ball is the best!  If you wanna play and you haven't been approached to play let Tyke know.  He'll most likely let you play ;).  Ok, now people can read this (except they already read it by this point) and go to bed cuz Tyke is done!
