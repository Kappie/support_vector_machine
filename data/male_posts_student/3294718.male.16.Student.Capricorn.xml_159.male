Something important happened today, but I can't remember what.   Too excited about Lupin too post anything. Tomorrow night, I'll probably be staying somewhere else but if I am home I'll blog longer.   Worked, came home, ate at Lou's. Read, listened to "Made in NYC," which I am now convinced is the greatest song ever written.  I can hear the opening strains of the Lupin theme song already...
