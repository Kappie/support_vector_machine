I followed the mad l337 instructuons of mad leet coder dan east (this guys on par with carmack) and it turns out the PPC windows OS version for ARMs works for the Xscale, so I got Quake on my PPC.  shit yeah.  i was up all night making changes to the autoexec and h4x0ring the filez0rs. cuz im a haxor.  yeah so now it runs at like 8-10 fps.    Shut up.  i dont see *U* playing quake in geometry and english, fag!  damn right!  now everyone cranes there head over to my desk to watch quake.
