Max and Fred did, too, but I didn't include them in the bold print because THEY NEVER UPDATE THE BLOG! *hint* *hint*. Anyway, I am going to reveal the name of my social studies teacher that I really hate (you'd know this from looking at my previous blog  urlLink here ) Without any further adieu, Mrs. --- really is Mrs. O'Malley-Hicks! Yes, I said that right! Marilyn O'Malley-Hicks! Truth be told, though, she really is a nice person, and her heart is in the right place, but I think it would be best to point out that: A) Mrs. O'Malley gives out 'social studies' assignments that turn out to either be busywork, artistic assignments, or 1/2 of your grade, B) She turned two of my classmates, Stacie and Elena, into unofficial TA's, making them do all of the work the SHE should be doing (the students are not the teachers), C) She never accurately informed us of deadlines for projects, or even more importantly, if there  were  any projects assigned, D) She spent so much time yakking and handing out 'creative assignments' (artistic assignments that have almost no guidelines or parameters, yet if not exactly the manifestation of her idea of the perfect rendering of the project, were way of course and were not listened to directions [what directions?]) that the class learned absolutely nothing, and if we did, it wasn't interesting, and E) She is a complete and total loon. She too patriotic for her own good, and she cares too much about people (don't get me wrong: caring about the homeless is a nice thing to do, but at the rate she was going over to the homeless shelter, they were probably barring her from going over there any longer). During the summer, I didn't want Social Studies, because I knew it would be boring (I didn't know who my teacher was, however), but I said to myself, "Hey, at least we can look forward to learning and Europe (part of the 7th grade Social Studies curriculum) (I think Europe is really cool)". But, Mrs. O'Malley spends 170 out of the 180 school days jabbering on about the Middle East, Asia, and Oceania. When Mrs. O'Malley promises that she'll give us Europe near the end of school, it just happens to slip her mind (and she said it right before we neared the end of school) and  we go off into 8th grade without any learned material about Europe, which some High School teacher is bound to give us a first week of school pop quiz on. Darn. I really hate what Mrs. O'Malley did. Oy vey. Anyway, I saw "The Stepford Wives" with Josh and Cam, on Tuesday (6/22). Man, that was FUNNY. Seriously, they purposefully made the movie into a comedy, and they did a fine job of it. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT. Oh, yeah, on Tuesday I started a new Flash movie, which I hope to have done on tomorrow (Thursday) or on Friday. It's really funny, and it's called "The Chair of Doom". That's all I'm going to say. Actually, I'll give you one more tidbit: It's using a lot of jpegs. Not one more word about it, my mouth is shut. Okay, back to the real world: I'm going to try out for the Youth Orchestra when they hold auditions in later this summer. I'm going to play "Menuet from Divertimento in D, K.334" by Mozart (the good one, W.A.)(yes, it  is  spelled Menuet this time around). It is a great piece, the trio is a little bit hard, but I think I can nail it with a few weeks of practice (trio as in musically, not with 3 players). Piano is good; I'm playing a Bach prelude. Tenor is fine as always. And now for something completely different. Yes, I meant to take that from Monty Python's Flying Circus. I'm watching more of Monty Python now. Also, talking about sketch comedy, I'm watching some of the SCTV DVD's my Dad got for father's day. Those are great, too. I'm surrounded by comedic masterpieces. By the way, if you don't know what SCTV is, look it up: it was one of  the  best sketch comedy shows ever, so Google it. If you don't know what either of them are, you've either been under a rock for the last 30 years or you've just broken out of the loony bin. Hey, get back in there and take your medicine.  Talking about lines with "take your medicine" I just finished "The Shining" by Stephen King, and now I want to see the movie with Jack Nicholson (I know the book and movie are vastly different, but still). Now, I'm reading "Catch-22" by Joseph Heller. Great book with lots of cynicism, sarcasm, and just dark comedy. Great book. Read it. Or else. Muwahahahahahahahahahahaha.   P.S. If either Fred or Max are reading this and they didn't catch on to the 'subtle' hint at the beginning,  please   POST MORE OFTEN TO THE BLOG!!!  I am not concerned about the website ( urlLink thegh.tk ), but rather the blog. Please post. Once you get the hang of it, you can make the posts into entire novels, like I do all the time. Hey, it's fun, but don't try it at home, kids ;)! Until later, I'm outa here!
