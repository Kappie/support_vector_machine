Read this stuff, its heart warming, and since its the holiday season and all...i know its a depressing time for some, me included..read this {most is taken word for word from the email, anything with an * by it has been added} FACTS OF LIFE 1.At least 5 people in this work love you so much they would die for you. 2.At least 15 people in this world love you in some way. 3.The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you. 4.A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you. 5.Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep. 6.You mean the world to SOMEONE. 7.Without you, someone may not be living. 8.You are special and unique in your own way. 9.Someone you don't even know exists loves you. 10.When you make the BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER, something good comes from it. 11.When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look, because you most likely turned your back on the world. 12.When you think you have no chance at getting what you want, you won't get it. BUT, if you believe in yourself, you will get it sooner or later. 13.Always remember complements you have received, forget about the rude remarks. Everyone says bad things about other people, so when you hear something good from someone take it to heart*. 14.Always tell someone how you feel, then they will know. 15.If you have a truly great friend, take the time to let them know that they are great.
