Favourite line from that song - the whole thing - see my last post  Last Movie Watched - Monsters Inc  Favouite Line from the movie - so we put the kid back where it came from (throws moster behind door and you hear squelch noise.) to find a better tomorrow today!  Favouite part in the movie - The Musical at the end.  Day out of 10 - 10/10 - i couldnt have had a better day. It was really hot. Church was the most amazing thing. I was so encouraged. Cant wait till next week!  Last Site (Apart from Blogger.) - Hotmail  Most funny thing all day - The people thought we where super holy because all the flys flew away when we came near, little did they know we had loads of insect repelent on!  Most depressing thing all day - Nothing...........well i kinda miss dad........didnt think about school at all n i aint worried about it tomorrow.  Thing I cant wait to do - Go away on a Christian Outreach to Africa.  Thing i am dreading to do - Cant think of anything.  Most helpful bible book today - 1 Peter 5:7  Last Thought - I think that, that is dad on the phone.  Best Conversation today - With David Craig (no not craig david.) about mission in africa  Nicest food today - Pizza at lunch  Oh my gosh i cant believe how cool Bangor Elim church is. Some of the people in it are the nicest people that you could ever meet!  God Bless  Dave
