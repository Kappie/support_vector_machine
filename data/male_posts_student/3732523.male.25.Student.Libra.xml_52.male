Movies:    urlLink Aint It Cool News which is actually run on a really crappy server that is barely running half the time (Much like TCZ) and by an egotistical fat man (Much like TCZ) with a penchant for being very dirty about the most stupid things (Much like most TCZers)     urlLink Dark Horizons is a FAR better website for news and gossip relating to upcoming movie projects and the like. He also has quite good interview skills and his reviews of movies seem very close to my opinion. He's yet to let me down heavily, unlike Big Fat Harry from Aint It Cool     urlLink Apple Movie Trailers contains Quicktime trailers of all the latest movies coming out in a format that just blows the pants off of any streaming technologies like WMV and Real. They also have a lot of older movie trailers (circa 1998) for those who want to laugh about how bad movies used to be, way back when.     urlLink IMDB is THE definitive resource for movie information. Ever wonder who played that guy, who did that thing, in that movie that year...This is where to look.     Geek:      urlLink Slashdot is news for nerds, stuff that matters...even if most the time it's just endless debate over how horrible Microsoft is and how our rights are being infringed every day of the week! Some decent nerdly stuff comes out occasionally though.     urlLink Spiderfan.org is probably the best compendium of Spiderman related information anywhere.     urlLink Gamespot , full of reviews, previews and information on any kind of game you can think of. Requires a subscription for some of the best stuff, but I'm cheap so I don't bother     Blog:      urlLink CMON is a bunch of hippies trying to compete with the local telco (that I work for) except their business plan is very dodgy. They recently got a whack load of money to do a feasibility study to see how much of a sucker local governments are (Ok, I mean to say they got money to study whether or not their business plan is feasible...talk about a loaded study, what are they going to say, "No, this is impossible, you'd waste your money on us if we did this")     urlLink Doug Alders Blog is an old boss of mine that writes his conspiracy theories and complains about being old. I like reading it just to think I'll never be that bitter :)     urlLink Belt0033's Blog is aboob. Plain and simple. An idiot who thinks he's smarter then he really is.    This one, I like TCZ     Community:        urlLink Conservatism is full of people who espouse how great Bush is and how dumb Democrats/Liberals are. Run by a complete MORON (Belt0033) who will sooner ban you then even attempt civility.     urlLink Republicans is full of people who espouse how great Bush is and how dumb Democrats/Liberals are. Not run by a complete MORON (I think he was banned for being too much of an idiot)     urlLink Liberal is full of hippies who like to say all corporations are evil and that we should all just love each other.     urlLink Martial Art is the community I started to get people interested in martial arts. I try to ask a question a day for people to respond to, trying to get people involved, trying to learn more, etc.     News:        urlLink Rush Limbaugh , you probably know who he is. Incredibly intelligent man, always right, etc etc.     urlLink The Drudge Report is run by Matt Drudge, an internet muck-raker who is more often more wrong then right.     urlLink Media Matters takes words spoken by Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'reilly and Fox News and unspins it with information backed up with facts. Rush and Bill both respond with the "left wing conspiracy" that is Media Matters     urlLink Fox News is fair and balanced     urlLink Canada.com is chock full of information about how much Canadians hate the US, how much the war in Iraq is failing, how ahead of the polls is Kerry against Bush, oh, and sometimes they mention Canada.     urlLink Bowling For Truth is the Anti-Michael Moore site that started it all. Takes everything said in Bowling for Columbine and attempts to explain it away.     urlLink Yahoo News is good for newinformation coming off thenewswire. The message boards attached to a story are pretty entertaining too.     urlLink BBC is some kind of news show.     Comics:      urlLink Penny Arcade pretends to be edgy, but all they come across as is big fat angsty computer nerds who occasionally do really good deeds (like getting their community to donate video games to sick kids). Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, they're based in Spokane WA, which is just across the border from us.     urlLink Sluggy Freelance is THE webcomic. There is no match. Excellent art, awesome lorax humour.Worship the Comic. (The only webcomic I'd pay to get in hardcopy form)     urlLink It's Walky , which is quickly coming to a close (The author is killing off all the characters to start a new series) was pretty good for a teen angst with superpowers kind of dealio. Then he got bored     urlLink PVP Online has it all. Computer nerd, fat boss, 30-something hippy, two fat ex-jocks..All in comic form. Art is really good (although it's just copy and paste of various poses that have been drawn before). Quite funny and pretty fresh.     urlLink User Friendly is everything PVP isn't. The art is crap; it's boring, repetitive and overly nerdy. Used to be a big thing back when everyone hated Microsoft (The whole comic is basically office culture and nerd humor, much like PVP). Most people don't like User Friendly anymore, but I used to work with a couple of these guys, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.     urlLink College Roomies from Hell is drawn by a chick, and is basically the same plot line of It's Walky. Teen angst with superpowers.     urlLink Sinfest is the edgy comic that Penny Arcade wants to be. Deals with god, satan, sluts, presidents, ninjas, pigs and overbearing Christian parishioners. Love it.     urlLink Cagle's Political Cartoons is a compendium of various newspaper artists who do political satire comics. Sometimes it's better then the actual news.      I think that's enough for now. Melia's going to kill me for spamming the board again.
