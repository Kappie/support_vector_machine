Although games in the rain are fun, it is the complete opposite when you are reffing. It wasn't too bad though. I reffed two games and made 46 big ones. You are in store for some nifty gifts from Egypt, maybe. Haha. On another topic, ignorant people tick me off. There is nothing i hate more than people who open their mouth when the have no clue what they are saying. If I ever coach a team, all the parents are going to be required to read the rule books. If they don't, they won't be allowed to say anything.  By the time my game started the rain decided to stop. The field was still plenty messy though. Like usual we got off to a slow start and missed numerous chances. We really need to learn how to finish plays and get the ball in the back of the net. Anyway, we still pulled out a 4-1 victory. Now we are only one victory away from my first undefeated regular season ever. Its about damn time. Then we get a two week break and districts start. Unfortunately, I will miss them (but I'll be in Greece. Yay) but I know my team will get us into state. Then who knows what will happen from there. Our version of the Triple Crown sounds nice: districts, state, and bluegrass.   Well, I better get back to help planning our trip to Egypt.
