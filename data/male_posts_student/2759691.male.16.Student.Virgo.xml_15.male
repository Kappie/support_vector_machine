Unfortunately for President Bush, the estate wasn't as private as he thought. Irish television crews report that they caught the President on film while he was changing his clothes. An embarassed Irish government quickly declared that the film was "property of the Irish presidency" and banned it from being used.  When asked about the right of a free press, a White House spokesman dismissed the taping as a violation of the President's privacy. The Department of Homeland security has said that any airing of the tape may be a "treat to our [America's] national security."  "Either you're with us," said an angry President Bush, "or you're going to air the tape." The Irish government has not commented apart from saying that the tape was "tasteless" because of the "cheap Chinese clothes."
