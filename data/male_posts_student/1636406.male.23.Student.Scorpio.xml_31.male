So first a summary, the election is charged with a handful of hot yet mostly irrelevant issues only because they are debatable and make good news. First we have the sponsorship scandal-- Let me sum this up by saying it is over-blown nonsense. 100 million dollars was spent on a sponsorship program, it is merely some pork barreling that went to liberal friendly agencies. So they spent the equivalent of 748 thousand us dollars-  big deal more money is spent in iraq in week. The second hot topic is privatization of health care. The only reason this is an issue is because of the popularity of the conservative party that will introduce private health care elements to our economy. There was also talk of other issues like gay marriage, funding for cities- but all were really minor points.  The majority of the debate consisted of Paul Martin getting picked on by Jack Layton, with Stephen Harper throwing in his 2 slimy cents and Duceppe asking a few questions. Layton was the most eloquent, and really came off as Trudeauish, and by that I mean fruity. Harper was mostly eloquent, but didn't say much, he came off as weak (which I believe he is) and childish, if I had to place a bet he's either the youngest or only child in that family. Martin resembled a goat attempting to climbing a muddy hill, he was all over the place, out of control, arrogant, and very ineloquent. Duccepe shouldn't have even been there- he was such a waste of time but was probably considered due to cbcs marketing purposes towards the Quebec market. It would have been more interesting to have thrown in the Green Party- but the CBC wants it's little turn at trying to stir a big pot so they threw in some french onions.  So before the debate I was going to vote liberal, but now I am most likely going to vote NDP. Layton is the strongest, and best suited for the job, Martin is an out of touch old man who disgusts me to be honest- here is a man with all the tools of government at his disposal, and instead of showing them off like a kid with his daddie's gun he makes promises!? It's insane, he deserves to lose.   I think I've decided to vote NDP. I don't care if Harper gets in- and if he lasts his 4 years without getting a bullet in his head it will be a miracle! Lest we forget the spartan army was comprised of homos- if Harper pisses them off who knows what they will do... and if he takes away the right to choose beware of pissed feminists.  Its going to be tough but I have about 13 days to think about it. Good luck to all those involved- I can't say I'm very enthused to see these results... but this is politics at in its most interesting state.
