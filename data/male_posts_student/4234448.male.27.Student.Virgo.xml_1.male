The Gospels in the New Testament were not eyewitness reports.  A typical reconstruction of how they came into being is this:  In a beginning of that is cloudy to us, there was a Jesus who lived and died.  Following his death, there was a period of oral transmission for forty or so years.  During this time, folk stories and sayings of a sort were passed from one teller to the next in a variety of contexts.  Then, some writers came along and began to make this oral tradition a written tradition.  In both traditions, one can imagine that the story was told, embellished, and edited in a number of different ways as people sought to make meaning out of life.  For better or worse, these meanings were always political.  At the end of the long process of telling and writing the story of Jesus, we eventually got some gospels written in Greek.  We get the slightly muffled version of these gospels in our English Bibles today.  When ever I think about this process that created the gospels, I think to myself, "Why did it have to end?"  None of us our ever going to know what "really happened."  So why not continue in our efforts to make meaning out of life by re-telling the story of Jesus?   Why not continue in our search for meaning through the creative excitement that occurs when one's imagination works with the materials of tradition, with the materials that have been handed to us?  Who said we can't do this?
