The noise of Fang barking and heavy footsteps makes Ron stop pounding on the door.  "Fang move aside. It's bloody three in da morning, this better be good." Hagrid bellows, as he opens the door and swings it wide to see a smiling Ron looking at him.  "Ron what's wrong? Harry in trouble? He's not in the forest is he?"  "No Hagrid, none of that. I'm sorry I had to wake you but I need a huge favor," begs Ron in an almost pleading voice.  "What favor? At three in da morning, come in here and tell me what's going on." Hagrid said, ordering Ron to come in and pointing at the table and chair for Ron to sit in.    Ron explains the whole conversation he had with Professor Dumbledore, minus the Hermione part, to Hagrid over tea and his rock cakes. Oddly enough, Ron ate the rock cakes as he figured it would be the only thing he could keep down in his stomach. They were just too heavy to throw up.  "I still don't see why this couldn't wait for da morning Ron. Are you telling me everything?" asks Hagrid suspecting Ron's strange behavior.  "Hermione is seeing...Malfoy, and I want to leave before I see her in the morning."  "Hermione seeing Draco, - CODSWALLOP! Where you hear such a lie?"  "Listen Hagrid, I really don't want to re-live it. You can ask her yourself. So can I have the recommendation, please Hagrid?"  "Sure Ron, but you are making a mistake about Hermione."   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ron raced back to the Gryffindor tower to pack. After an hour and a half of silently packing in the dark, Ron had everything he needed and everyone was still asleep, even Harry.  Ron set down at his study desk; he figured he owned Ginny an explanation.  Dear Ginny,    I don't have much time so I will be brief. At times like this, you find out who your real friends are and just how important family is. Unfortunately, yesterday I learned the hard way.    I am leaving Hogwarts for the next 3 months to take a Co-op job with Charlie in Romania. I am not sure if I will be any good handling dragons, but I definitely will be glad to be away from this place. Please keep Pig for me while I'm gone, because I seriously doubt if he can fly and deliver on such a long international route. Better to use International Postal Owls instead. I promise while I am gone to write once a week to you.    I love you Ginny and I am sorry I will not be around during Christmas; it just really hurts and I need some time and space.  -Ron  PS. Keep this info to yourself, I do not want anyone else knowing where I am. That especially means a certain Head Girl.  PSS. Don't tell Harry, the back stabbing git, either!  PSSS. Keep an eye on Harry for me.      Ron attaches the letter to Pig's leg for him to deliver it to Ginny during breakfast. He performs the Feather Weight Charm to his old locker and attaches it to the back of his CleanSweep broomstick. Then he climbs down the spiral staircase for the Gryffindor common room.    However, In the common room on top of a chair near the portrait entrance, set Crookshanks watching Ron come down the stairs.    Ron at first used to hate Crookshanks but after several years, they both began to tolerate one another. As if only for the sake of Hermione, both of them learned to be friendly.  "Meow!"  "Crookshanks?" asks Ron in disbelief that anyone would be up much less an always-sleeping cat.  "Purr!"  Ron pets Crookshanks and says, "Crookshanks...I cannot believe I'm talking to a cat. I am losing it."  Ron exhales as he finishes shaking his head before adding, "Crookshanks keep an eye out for Hermione for me. I am going to be gone for a while, so it is your job to protect her. Oh, and do me a favor if you see Malfoy, claw his balls off for me."  "Meow!"   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "Five fifteen - just need to drop this recommendation off in McGonagall's office then I'm out of here." Ron said to himself leaving his broom and trunk hovering near the front entrance next to the Great Hall.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Hermione rose up early than usual after having another romantic dream of Draco and her by the lake. She could almost feel his kisses on her lips. The sensation brings a small smile to her face as she takes a shower and dresses in her school uniform. She decides to go to breakfast a little bit early today, as she has to post the new Prefect Patrol schedule along with the new dress code requirements for Prefects. Lately the school dress code had not been strict as it once was. Allowing students to wear individual apparel and personal clothing items. Not to mention how a few of the boys are looking and dressing like slobs, one Redhead Prefect in particular came into mind when Draco and Hermione agreed to re-enforce the dress code rules. She knew she had to speak with Ron about that and about skipping out of Potions from yesterday. Of course, she would have to wait until eight o-clocks before he usually get up. As for enforcing the dress code throughout Hogwarts, Draco and she would need the staffs' approval for the general student population and the next staff meeting is a week away.    Hermione strolls to the Great Hall to find a broomstick and a locker near the entrance.  "I can not believe someone, some lazy oaf, left this in the hallway," cries Hermione in the hopes that the someone hears her.  "Fine. Then I'll have to confiscate it until someone is willing to take detention for it," announces Hermione to the hallway as she pulls out her wand and stands beside the broomstick.    The old and used locker had a Gryffindor seal on it, and looks vaguely familiar to her. Then she notices the initials RBW on the side of the locker.  "Expelliarmus!"    Hermione wand immediately flies out of her hand and lands banging and rolling down the hallway 20 feet away. Now she is really mad, as magic is not allowed in the hallways after classes. She angrily spins around to see a tired and sick Ron pointing his wand at her.  "Ron, what are you doing?! You are-a-Prefect! You are not supposed to be doing magic in the hallways," screams Hermione not believing how stupid her best friend can be. "Are you even listening to me?!"  Ron ignores her row as he walks past her and jumps on his broomstick. He kicks off hovering eight feet off the ground as if to avoid her reach.  "Ron you can not fly in the hallways! Get down here this instant!"  Ron took one deep look at Hermione before saying, "I'm leaving. Good bye â€“ Hermione Granger."  Ron turns his head toward the front entrance and slowly flies his way to it as Hermione is screaming and jumping at him from below.  "Ronald Weasley, you get down here this instant! What do you mean leaving?! I have a good mind to write your mother!"  Ron clears the giant front wooden doors and without looking back, he takes off into the sunrise.  "Ron! RON!" screams Hermione feeling remorse and pain at watching Ron fly away.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  As Harry and Ginny are eating breakfast, Harry looks up and around the Great Hall before asking, "Have you seen Ron? His locker and his clothes are missing as well."  Just then, Pig flies in a circle pattern over to Ginny and delivers a letter to her, hooting in celebration. The letter brought a worry face to Ginny as she unties the letter from Pig's leg.  "What is it Gin? Is it Ron?" asks Harry really worry about his best mate, as he watches Ginny read the letter in Ron's handwriting.  Ginny's facial complexion turns to a deep red as she finishes the letter.  "He left!"
