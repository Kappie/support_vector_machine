OK so i just got home from hanging out with nicole and it was great.  We first went to the mall because she had a coupon for a necklace or something but they said NO! and she cried, well not really but we were sad.  Then i remember that today is monday, and thats snowcrab night at  red lobster  so im like,"Lets get some crabs," and she's like, "from hookers again?" and im like "no from red lobster!"  so im like ill treat.  (paraphrased) so we went and had lotsa fun. We talked about life and its meaning and how much our naked grandma is kinda gross.  So the waitress was kinda rude to use because she probably thinks we tip bad, but my sis always makes me over-tip.  So after a long meal, we ask for the bill and im like   me: Hey nicole, pass me your purse under the table  nicole: Why!?  me: Just do it  nicole: NO!  me: come on!  nicole: are you gonna take the plates?  me: no why would i want the plates?  nicole: NO!  me: (me eyeing the bisketssss)  nicole: NO! they lose their taste when you leave the resturant!  me: yesssssss!  nicole: NO!  It was good, So they waitress came with the bill and i pull out my phone because it has a tip calculator and im said i never get to use it and now i can.   ....*calculating* ....   me: we owe her $4.00  nicole: give her $5.00  me: No!  nicole: Yes  So i counted out $5 in singles and i put it in the black book thing and as i put it on the table i pulled out $1 and couldnt stop laughing.  I choked on my soda.  So we left and i told nicole and she got mad, but then was glad i did it.  We got back to my house and im like you can keep the bizkits and she's like we went through all that and now you dont want them! so im like  mom will see the evidence  and  shes like so will ryan !  So shes like take them and im like ok and as she was pulling out of the driveway, i put them on the seat. so when she was on the street, she threw the box at me (the bizketss) and it opened up so there was biskets on the driveway.  I picked them up and started throwing them at her car and kept hitting her hood and door. IT WAS SOOO AWESOME!!! I WAS ON THE GROUND LAUGHING SO WILDLY!  I could hear her as she drove off skweeling (spelled like this from now on)in her car (she was laughing) it was great.  I called her and she was laughing so much she almost died!    O i almost forgot, between the trip to the mall and the trailer-trash extravaganza at red lobster, we went to the dollar store and i got some certs..... i believe 12 packs.  I just grabbed the whole box carrier thing they were in. In the car i put 13 mints in my mouth (well i had enough to do it)!  I only paid $3 for all of them.  is awesome!  So thats it for now, ill write more later, also garrett and kat, WRITE MORE!!  look who never updates now!  hehehehhehe
