Just 2 minutes into the first period, Martin Gelinas scored his 8th of the playoffs, only for Martin St. Louis to pull one back at the end of the period.   15 minutes into the second period, Iginla scored a helluva good goal, driving the puck from wide on the right wing stickside past Khabibulin, and in off the post, only for Fredrik Modin to level it up at 2-2 at the start of the 3rd.  Overtime was when Iginla really shone through. In a long shift for his offensive line, he managed to get his helmet knocked off, but carried on playing, feeding a pass to Oleg Saprykin, who scored to finish the game, and give the Flames the chance to win the cup at home in the Saddledome. Which they should win if they play like that again.  GO FLAMES!
