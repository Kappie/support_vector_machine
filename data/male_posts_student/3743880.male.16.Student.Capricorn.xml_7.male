His outfit with the big red Sis the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the Kents found him.Those are his clothes. What Kent wears, the glasses the business suit,that's the costume. That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us. And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent?He's weak, unsure of himself... he's a coward. Clark Kent is Superman's critiqueon the whole human race, sort of like Beatrix Kiddo and Mrs. Tommy Plumpton.
