We were supposed to do an animation using whatever method we preferred (frame-by-frame or motion tweening) and so I chose to use frame-by-frame because it was the most suitable one for that type of movie (a jumping robot, which moves every part of its "body" [composed by a tin head, a tube and some sort of plate in which it stands]) and what did I get for a grade? 25! (out of one-hundred) YAAAY!  I hate Mr. Escalante he's like the most retarded cripple ever created. And why did i get a 25? because I used the most appropiate way for a particular movie. That what happens when you look too smart for [a cripple] someone. WHAT A FUCKING CRIPPLE... I wish I could just steal his earphone or something [which would be really funny, BTW]  and then, in drawing, the teacher checked out sketch-books. Oh man. you wouldnt believe my grades, they were so bad, and my art teacher thinks im retarded or something... "This isnt switzerland... how should I know it's not switzerland? I could say this is in africa, the US, costa rica, anywhere!" "but there arent any.. alps in those countries?" "SHUT UP DONT DISCUSS WITH ME YOUVE GOT 27!!!" so basically a 27 is a very low low low low low (...) low low low low low grade. >.  Stupid pothead.  Anyways, then I went to french, which was ok, then to lunch, when Max[XD] made me follow him around because he has no friends, and his popularity [his what?] comes from playing paintball [and smelling real bad] Because i had no other choice as to follow him or not, i went and read about fascism. Now I really know what fascism is, and learned that its pretty bad. Oo;.  Then in spanish, um... nothing special, boring as always. I drew a bad face and then listened to more music.  And then I... came home and ive got to start and finish a proyect for tomorrow, math homework, and uh.... thats it. ^_^  I better get to work , bye!
