Not much has happened in these months. Just before Thanksgiving I went to MIT for an annual set of seminars and stuff to make us more cultured...culture? Mmmm...yogurt... Meet the Candidates Night at school was productive back in December. That was the UberProject that Gleason assigned to us, never knowing how big it ended up being. We went to Applebee's afterwards and everyone acted drunk. Christmas was cool, I got a bunch of stuff for my car and it's all pimped out now. I got TireFlys. light-up dice, cathode tubes for the inside, and a bunch of other stuff too. Brothar got Xbox and a bunch of games from me, and that collection is growing weekly. New Year's was ok...had to work, so I was really tired and never watched that accursed ball drop. Whatever. After new Year's I had to do Fiscal Inventory, so everyone at the store was there for hours and hours :(. New Classes started a little after New Year's (Spanish, CAD/Free Block, French, Trig.), and with the New Year means new FIRST game. check it out at www.usfirst.org . My friend Brandon and I are working on an animation for it this year, and we had one almost done until his hard drive died. D.I.E.D., as in RIP. can't even access it as a slave. So we have to make a much more Spartan animation than we had planned. The rest of January was alright, and my boss Mr. Davis just left the store like last week to work at a store closer to his house. His replacement (Mr. Beaky lol) looks just like him. Scary, non? I've gotten a few compliments from the higher-ups at work saying I'm a good worker and stuff like that. I got my first promotion today...that means that instead of wearing a red "trainee's" apron, I have a blue "bagger's" apron. I really wanna move to Dairy, Produce, Meat, Grocery...somewhere but the front end, as it sucks. The robot is sexy this year. Check it out on the chiefDelphi forums... I dont' remember the exact URL but just search for Team 134 Robot at www.chiefdelphi.com and you'll see it on the top of the list. ignore the idiot's comments. Seth burned me a copy of the media form my old computer (before it crashed), and the 16 files that I wanted on the 4 cds he burned (about 2.4 GB) were the only 16 that didn't burn correctly. That's just my luck these days. I'm addicted to anime now, especially the "really sad for Americans to like" animes, like Azumanga Daioh and Chobits ;'( *tear*. I think my favorite, though, is Last Exile. Head on over to the MegaTokyo forums and there is a board where you can post your favorite animes and why. I guess that's all that there is to post about tonight. If I feel like I missed anything at all, you know I'll post it, whether you wanna hear it or not.  --Raine
