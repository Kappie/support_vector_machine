For significant portions of it I was nearly convinced that I was on Candid Camera, or one of its more meanspirited new-school MTV successors.  I got to see a bunch of good shows, and I missed an equal number.  I hung out with Norwegians.  I pulled a Sarah and disappeared for several hours.  And to top it all off, I walked fifteen miles from 2:30 AM to 6:00 AM, wandering southwest Indiana along I-74 looking for a gas station in the mistaken (yes, mistaken) belief that I had run out of gas while napping at a rest stop.  There were opossums and dogs.  Fortunately the only injuries I sustained were the blisters I gave myself by running the two miles between Lizton and Pittsboro in Chuck Taylors.  If you want anything clearer than this, you need to call me.  I do not have the energy to recount the events in the detail they truly require just now.  Oh, and then on Monday after I got back to Bloomington an 87-year-old man clipped me with his car trying to fit it into a space narrower than said car at around fifteen over the speed limit.  Then he tried to lie to a cop about it.
