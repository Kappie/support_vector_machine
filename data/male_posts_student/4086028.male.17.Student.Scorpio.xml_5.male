It's wierd how a 'small' statement can bring together things that have shied away from the frontal lobe.  Revalation seems a bit heavy - more an encroaching sense of recognition. Even more daunting are the times  a journey comes to an end. Often your first fledgling steps can appear cumbersome on hindsight, but given the opportunity would you change them? Having reached the end of the path to China my mind is unwilling to take in that there is no longer the adventure of reaching the adventure. This  is  the adventure. It's odd when you saunter back and observe just how institutionalised you can become into the life that you know. When you see that every little habit that you have has evolved from some small niche unbeknownst to you, how can you even tell what will happen when the safety net dissolves.
