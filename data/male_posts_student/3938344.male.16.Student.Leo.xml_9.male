Now, this should stand out as a poor choice of judgment on its own, but it doesn't end there.  I walked in and was immediately accosted by a t-shirt, right in my face.  I recognized the front at first as reminiscient of Maddox (www.thebestpageintheuniverse.com) 's t-shirts (and I thought it was at first) but something nagged at me.  It just wasn't awesome enough. So, I looked harder and harder, and as I was looking I remembered something he had mentioned about his logo making fun of someone named Che and how Che was regarded as a revolutionary but was really just a pinko.  So, when I got home today, I did a little Google search under "Che".  What I found was not pretty.  Not pretty at all.    Now, if you have any information about Che, you will know that he was a marxist who raised all sorts of hell in Guatemala before going to Cuba to support Castro in his takeover and later got killed in Bolivia.  This alone is beyond disturbing, considering that HIS HEAD WAS ON A FUCKING T-SHIRT IN AMERICA.  But if we delve deeper, we find that his belief was that a violent revolution alone could change the status quo in Latin America.  Now, I'm not saying at all that the dictators who held those countries were great guys who were completely innocent; they were right bastards themselves.  However, stirring up guerrilla wars across the whole continent without trying anything else is not the act of a true leader; it is the act of a cowardly terrorist.    Disagree with that assertion?  Then consider this.  At the beginning of the 20th century, the USA was not just unjust; it was extremely fucked up.  Racism, sexism, and all sorts of that shit abounded in forms we who were born in the later half of the 20th century can't even imagine.  Did we have to have a violent, bloody revolution to get racial equality? Hell no.  Those incredible activists in the days of the civil rights movement managed to get equal rights for all races and both sexes, and with nonviolent techniques to boot.  Now, you may be thinking, "BUT ANDRAS THEY WERENT UNDER ANY PRESSURE THATS NO REAL COMPARISON LOL".  (By the way, if you do think that way, there is something serioiusly wrong with you.)  Well, then, I guess it was just absolutely safe for any African-American to simply walk out in the middle of town after a nice long protest speech or sit-in, right?  Wrong.  They would probably get their shit ruined, if they weren't simply lynched on the spot.  You see, repression doesn't necessarily need to be government-sanctioned to still be repression.  This is something Communists, Marxists, and Socialists never really got, and have a tendency to ignore even today.    Now, if a minority of people in this country could bring about equal rights for generations to come (I think they're regressing with affirmative action, but we're getting off topic), then what was a majority of people in those countries could have conceivably held a nonviolent movement to reform the militaristic governments ruling them.  But then Che and his "revolutionaries" (I say this with deepest contempt) came in and completely fucked up the process for these countries.  As an indirect result, long after many of those governments were overthrown in Che's style, we have "democratic republics" there.  I use the quotes here because they're democracies only in name; in practice, they are no better than the regimes they overthrew.  Thus, what did he really accomplish? He helped Cuba go from bad to worse, and later completely screwed over the Latin American continent.  I bet at least half of the Che supporters who are reading this page are probably putting their fingers in their ears, squeezing their eyes closed, and murmuring,"SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP..." while curled up in a fetal position.  I'm guessing this because most of what I found in my search was propaganda by radical groups, the reality chewed up and spat out by a bunch of rich children who only have the luxury to be this stupid because we helped put an end to this menace to society.    Now, I'll get into the punk movement (almost like the bowel movement, but much more disgusting) later, but still, when a group focuses on someone who basically fucked up the entire Latin American area for the duration as a role model, one tends to wonder what is really going on behind the scenes.  I, as a good American citizen, have the obligation to cry bullshit on this one, not only because it is frightening beyond belief that teenagers all across the country are flocking to this terrorist hack as a role model but that it could mean a much more dangerous trend -- yes, I'm talking about a resurgence in Communism and Socialism.  I've seen it coming on over the past couple of years, and this sighting of that unholy icon on a T-shirt only reinforces my point.  I only hope that people will realize they're being dipshits before the American way is completely fucked over.
