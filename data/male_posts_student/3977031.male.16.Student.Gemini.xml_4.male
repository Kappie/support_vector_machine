Now everyone who reads The Blog (I think everyone will find this blog to be the blog of all blogs, and soon everyone will be referring to it as "The Blog.") has to deal with me and my opinions.   For now we will allow anyone to post comments. However, if comments get out of control, I am afraid I will have to limit comment posting to members of the Blog only. Comments should only be posted if they contain useful information or an interesting perspective on the topic being discussed. Comments containing things such as "u r gay!!!," "u r a fag," "u r going to hell," "u r stupid," etc. should not be posted. Firstly, they are unfounded accusations. Secondly, they are not spelled correctly. Thirdly, they are not grammatically correct. Lastly, The Blog will do its best to use correct spelling and grammar so that you, the reader, will be able to read it hassle-free, and I would like to request that you show The Blog the same respect that it shows you.
