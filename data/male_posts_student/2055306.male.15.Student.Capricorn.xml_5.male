I'm going to be courted but I don't think it's "wrong" to date. To me it is beucase i'm not going to do that, but to others it isnt. I think it has to do with convictions. My whole problem with the opposite sex is that none of them like me. Yeah sounds stupid and you'd all disagree, but the way I see it is that no one likes me. Just wanting to not date is hard enough on its own, and sometimes not thinking anyone likes me makes waiting a bazillion times harder. Things like "what if theres nothing to wait for" and "what the heck is wrong with me" go through my head all the time. Its like if I were to date, I could go out and probly get some guy to like me or something, and then "go out"and get a bf but like, i think because I am so set in my ways of courtship and so vocal about it, that no one even thinks about liking me. For me the longing for a relationship has absolutly nothing to do with the physical of it. Its totally emotional. I want to know that someone loves me, thinks I'm beautiful and I want that security kind of feeling. My mom once actually gave me the option to date, but I declined. I knew that God was calling me to something better and deeper. But its hard sometimes to hold on to that. I want to be loved sooooo badly. I have to trust so much that God knows what he's doing. And I have friends around me who date and at times thats hard. It doesnt really effect me too much anymore, but before it use to. Going back to the whole longing ot be loved thing is like, I'm learning that I need to fall in love with God and be in love with Him first. Not only will my relationship with Him grow, but in the time spent learning about Him and loving Him, waiting wont seem so hard or long. I mean, I'm going to be 17 and I don't expect it to be too much longer before God starts directing me. Though I really dont know when that will be, I have a feeling it wont be like forever. I know there IS someone out there for me. I've just gotta wait for Gods perfect timing. Anyway, I'll continue to pray for you about that Caleb cause I know how hard it can be. I right there in it with you. Dont worry, it will all be worth it in the end.
