Here's how my day went:  7:30 a.m.- Woke up accidentally.  Couldn't fall back asleep. 8:00 a.m.- Mom comes in, tells me I got chores to do. 12:00 p.m.- Parents leave and go places. 1:00 p.m.- Alarms start going off.  So I shut them off. 1:10 p.m. - Alarms go off again.  What the fuck is goin on? 1:20 p.m.- Irritated with the fact that the alarms went off, yet again. 1:30 p.m.- Shut the whole freakin' system off. 2:00 p.m.- Started watching "Torque." 3:40 p.m.- Parents come home. 4:00 p.m.- Decide to get on the bike and go learn some tricks from a friend. 4:10 p.m.- Tylenol from my alarm-causing headache kicks in, start feeling tired.  (Tylenol makes me sleepy)  And now, I just woke up.  So, my day has been absolutely boring.  In fact, its so boring, that I really don't have anything going through my mind right now.    This week is going to be the most productive that I've had all week.  Tuesday, I have to go pick up the Spiderman 2 game, since I'm the biggest Spiderman nerd in the whole freakin' town of The River, maybe even Florida.  Then Wednesday, I'm going to Universal to see the movie, and get on Revenge of the Mummy.  That should be fun.  Thursday night, I've got my Yearbook meeting dinner thing, so I'll actually see some of my friends.  And, Friday, I'm going to play Spiderman 2: The Game for several hours.  So, it's my "week of the spider," and I can't wait until it all kicks in.    In about an hour, I get to drive to the mall.  Yippee.  My brother and his friend from Michigan (I finally figured out where my brother was the whole time he was gone, haha) are going to see a movie, and my dad has a bad back, so he told me that I'm going to drive them there.  I think my fear after last week's accident is gone.  After driving about 30 miles yesterday, I think I got over the whole stupid thing.  The car's fixed anyway, so I don't really have anything to be worried about.  I just realized today that I am one of the most boring people on the face of this planet.  I'm always in the confinements of my bedroom, either playing on the computer, some videogame, or watching a movie.  On occasion, I'll be out with my friends that live in my neighborhood.  One of them has a sweet motocross track, and I watch a couple of them moto...race.  Yeah.  But, aside from that, I have to be one of the most boring people.  That's gotta change sometime soon.  Anyway, I'm going to sign off for now.  I may update again later tonight, but, if I don't, be sure to check out bagel.tech tomorrow if you get bored!  Until next time, do anything to keep yourself entertained.
