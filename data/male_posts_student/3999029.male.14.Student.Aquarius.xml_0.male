Don't ever mess with me or I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget. Stop this nonsense and don show me your fucking attitude. If you aren't satisfied with me, then tell me straight in the face, don be a coward and talk behind my back. Fooling around with me will not do you any good, it will only cause retributions.        If you ignore me and try pushing blames to me, or keeping back things that I am supposed to noe, u stand nothing to gain. It will only lead to your downfall. Do not assume that I am ignorant to things that are happening around me. I have every move to outwit you. Stop showing that attitude of ignoring me or trying to mess around with me, lest I blow up and start doing nasty things to you. Let this serve as a warning to those who plan to fool around with me.       I was feeling quite happy today when an incident sparked off me wanting to write this entry. The person who angered me happened to be one of those that I have placed great trust in. Another person from air rifle also tried to anger and incite me. I have already tolerated this person for a long time. This time he has really made me go mad. If he continues this kind of bahaviour, I may slaughter him with choppers and feed him to the pigs. So if this person is reading this entry, be warned. I am all out to kill you.       Such a joyous day spoilt with all these sudden happenings around me, I'm damn frustrated. I hope this will not happen again.
