Impact was soo amazing.. speaker was Geoff Sanfford, i think he was from minnesota, but yea he just concentrated on talkign about Humility, Integrity, Couage, Generosity, Gratitude, and Love. And they all just hit the spot in my lives. How our character is constantly being assaulted by Satan and that we need to live lives of Humility, Integirty and Courage so that God will lift us up in honor. It was really just life changing. So i was in Erase family!! WHOO HOOO go earsers! "Andale Andale mama ERASE ERASE UHOH!!" haha that was our cheer, got it from Nelly's EI. Yeahso got Andy Lee and Patty Eng as my mommy and daddy! haha That was just too cool, Andy being my D-group leader, and Patty my CSM counselor. My roommate was Jonathan Tao from WHCC, he was just the awesomest guy man, he was always so Godly and so just on track. He even reminded me about prayer partners. wow.. i'm so lucky to have had him as my prayer partner/roomate. oh! and the first day, while i was playing basketball, i played this whole game with a guy i didn't know, and yea afterwards, he was like "are you Joyce's cuz?" and Joyce being my cuz that i havn't seen in like forever, i didn't know he was talking about that Joyce, thought it was the one from church, so i was like uh.. no? lol and then he was like you sure? i'm John arn't you David and you have a lil brother Timothy, and i was like OH! yea yea yea adn turns out that guy was like my cuz from which i lyk played wit b/w ages 1-5 b4 i moved away. It was sooo awesome seeing him again, but yea.. embarassing i forgot him lol. and it turned out he was in my family too!! so that was cool, we got to catch up on some old times and hang out. ahhh but he broke his clavical at camp while playing bball, yea he's kinda skinny and playign wit those built guies.. dangerous.. and Andy sprained his ankle when he got a rebound and came down on Linda.. lol man our famiy got the most injuries award. The workshops were pretty cool, my first one was the Dating one with Jason. And he just talked about the 3 aspects of a relationships being with emotion, spiritual, and physical. And how the emotional and spiritual need to lead to the physical in a relationship if it's going to work. And how our relationships whethere in high school or in college shoudl be beneficial in our walk with Christ. They shoudl be our running partner in teh race that's around us. Life being a race, and we're all headed toward teh finish line, shouldn't be looking for someone that's still on the bleachres and hasn't started the race (nonbelievers) or someone that's sitting down or still at the beginnign of the race. Best is someone who's aorund you or even in spirituality etc. So yea.. my perspective now on dating nonchristians.. it's not wrong.. just it wouldn't be benenficial, and would never work out. And also the point of dating should be to look for our future spouse, so shouldnt' be dating just for the sake of it. er... Next worksshop was the quiet times with Danny, that was pretty cool but he talked soo much kinda forgot/lost track. But basically Quiet Times are important in that they let us go against what Satan wants, and it should be hard because it's against our norm of sinning and saying NO to God. Like dribblign a bball, if ur used to using right hand, then when switchign to left hand, takes more concentration and practice for you to be good at it, so queit times take practice as well, and going to attempt to be consisitent. Also he also talked about writing in Journals, and that when you write about how u feel, it lets you see from an outside perspective on who you really are, so i might start doing that.. if i dont' get lazy lol and the last workshop.. i was suppose to go to Honor and Obey, but everyone said it was boring as heck.. so went to Andy's workshop Civilization haha yea.. i know its wrong.. but Andy's was actlaly pretty interesting. It was like a debate where the civilians and president debating whether or not we'r going to go to War. And both sides presented secular and christian reasons, pretty cool but in teh end, haha there wasn't suppose to be a winner, but i sitll say we won.. civilians! lol so that was pretty fun, and yea there was a lot of bball playing, stefan and I beat the josh's!! oh yea! 15-8 it hink.. haha they really didn't expect that.. ah well it was prolly luck cuz i was making all my shots lol. So yea camp was awesome!! post camp rally Friday, July 30th 7:30! ok well dats it for now.. gotta go to Drivers ed.
