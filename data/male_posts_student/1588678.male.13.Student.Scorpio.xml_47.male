Sadly, someone in the family, you know who you are, did do so hot and brought in a 15 out of 24. Anyways, to the awards!  Looks like Peter Jackson proved himself, I mean, the dude won best picture with "The Return of the King." Oh, and I chose that. I mean, c'mon, everyone knew this was Jackson's year. Now that I look at it, he forked in a couple awards. Well, I must say myself, Return of the King ruled! And today shows that it really did. Anyways, Peter Jackson, rock on!  Other awards went to crappy people. Sadly, Sean Penn got a couple awards. I don't know, Sean Penn bothers me. But I gotta admit, "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" was a classic! But still, I didn't see "Mystic River." In fact, I didn't see "Lost in Translation." I wanna see that one. All and all, some awards were given to annoying and crappy actors or actresses such as Sean Penn and Renee Zellweger.   The performances were okay. I mean, you never really expect epic performances at the Oscars. But Jack Black and Will Farrell were funny. They sang a song talking about the background music when they film people that loose an award as the winner accepts it. And they were singing about how they play that music because the losers are boring. Still, it was funny. Oh lemme tell you something even more funny. Sean Connery. I mean, the guys voice almost seems like he does it on purpose. Like instead of "movies" he says "movesh" with a heavy Scottish accent. I just love reacting Sean Connery on the SNL Celebrity Jeopardy thing. It’s so much fun! “I’m the cock of the walk!” and “Surprise me you filthy bastard!” It’s funny as hell!  Well, this Oscars show wasn’t too bad. Once again, I’ll leave the clothing and red carpet stuff to Joan Rivers. Hehe. Okay, hope you enjoyed it, and well, hope you weren’t disappointed when “Brother Bear.” I know I wasn’t. Oh, as a “Part II” to my Oscars post, I’ll be posting a VERY important picture tomorrow hopefully. Be sure to check it out. See ya then.
