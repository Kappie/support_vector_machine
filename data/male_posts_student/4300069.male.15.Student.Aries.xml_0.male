I wear almost any form of black shirt, perferably silk.    I have 4 rings, one that is a full finger ring, you can see what kind it is by watching Interview With A Vampire, but it's a different style.  I have a Celtic ring that I just got a few days ago.  I have a half-finger ring that looks like some sort of dead bug, but I like it anyway, a spike goes over the second joint of my index finger, It's cool.  Last I have a ring that my ex girlfriend gave me, it's just a small band that broke a couple of days ago, but I still carry it with me.  She left me for a guy named Emilliono, some Mexican dude.  Yes I know darling, you don't like me using "Mexican" but I couldn't remember what you called them.  I wear a pendant that has three skulls one looking straight, one to the left and one to the right.  There is a cresent moon behind them that is turned 90 degrees so that it faces down.  I have 16 safety pins lineing my right cargo pocket, I did have 20 but my bro stole some.  One of them has a pentagram hanging from it.  I have 6 chains haning off of my pants, now thats what I call bondage *winks*.  No, it's just for style but I do have a chain addiction.  Other than all of this goth stuff, I am really a Renaissance person trapt in this time period.  So when I move away from Kansas, up to the west coast somewhere.  I will work in my family's bed and breakfast that is to come.  Hopefully I can drag Kasey with me when she is 15 or 16, I doubt that will happen though *cries*.  But I will come find her when I am 18 so I can at least see her.  When she turns to an age where she can leave her parents I'm going to come get her and take her with me.  If she so chooses.
