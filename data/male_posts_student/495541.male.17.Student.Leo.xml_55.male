I'm going to change my life.  I'm going to act differently.  I'm going to change it all.  Sound weird?  Yeah.  I just don't like where I'm at right now.  I'm not saying anything's wrong.  All I'm saying is I'm going to change.  Football practice today.  That was interesting.  It was a pretty quick practice.  We did quite a bit of scrimmaging.  I thought I did alright.  I thought we all did alright.  What I don't get is the coaches getting on use telling us we suck after all that.  And what I don't like is one coach telling me I'm a leader and I sucked.  Screw that.  What the hell kind of coaching is that?  I guess if I don't knock someone down every play, I did something wrong.  All I remember from the scrimmages is people on the right side of the o-line letting all the d-line guys by.  I really don't mean to put it on them, but that's really what happened.  I know I screwed up a couple times (probably more) but for a coach to tell me I sucked when I don't think I did... that's wrong.  That probably sounds dumb.  It does.  You may be thinking... this guy's just saying that because he doesn't want to look bad if he really did suck.  You're probably right.  For all I know, maybe the coach only looked at me when I was messing up.  Who knows.  Anyways, school starts on Monday.  I haven't even gone school shopping yet.  I guess I'm kind of waiting for my mom to ask me if I want to go school shopping or something.  I have a feeling if we haven't gone by now, she's not planning to ask me.  It's probably more of a financial issue more than anything with my sister's wedding coming up and everything associated with it.  I think we all know weddings cost a lot of money.  I think when I get married; it's not going to be an expensive wedding.  Why does it have to?  It doesn't.  When two people love each other enough to engage in marriage, they're not thinking about the expense of their wedding.  They're thinking about their future with each other.  So with that in mind, I'm saying I'm not going to have an expensive wedding.  By the time I do get married; my parents are probably going to be dirt poor.  I'm the last child, so all the college loans and everything they've had to go through will catch up.  Weee.  It's getting pretty late here.  I'm kind of surprised I've been able to blabber so much about almost nothing.  I guess when you think about stuff enough, you can think of anything to write.  Tomorrow I've got practice in the morning.  Coach said we'd only be on the field for about 45-an hour.  Then we'd watch tape of the scrimmage.  I hope I didn't screw up that much.  If I remember, I'll update you on how much I actually screwed up.  Maybe I'll take down some numbers on how many times I did something wrong.  You'd just love that, I bet.  Just keep in mind this if I come back to you with info about how I did worse than I said: people tend to remember things in their favor.  It's true.  That's about it for now.  Good night.
