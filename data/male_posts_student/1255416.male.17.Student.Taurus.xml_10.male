I said that a computer would be just as capable of creating a beuatiful piece of music as anything produced by a trained musician.  I was wrong.  I thought that what poeple thought of as artistic expression was actually just an imaginary imperfection placed in the music or whatever.  This isn't true.  great art can cause someone to feel something.  Bad art doesn't.  The most obvious example is acting.  A technically bad actor will most always be terrible.  A technically bad actor will also be very easy to spot.  However, just because someone is technically good, doesn't mean they're a good actor.  A good actor is someone who can make the audience feel something, be it happiness, sadness, pity, whatever.  If the audience is bored or if the audience jsut plain doesn't like a certain part of a play, then it's bad acting.  Plain and simple.  No amount of technical superiority can fix this.  I probably should have realized this loooong ago, but no matter, any thoughts anyone who actually reads this thing?  Who does read this thing anyway?
