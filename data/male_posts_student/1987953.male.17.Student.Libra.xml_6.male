Keep coming back I guess. Okay, I have a question, friends. If I got into an argument with my girlfriend's friend about how she treats my girlfriend, and I am right, and was totally honest but yet nicer than most people would be, and yet her friend keeps twisting my words and trying to get me in trouble with Brittany, though it doesn't work,  should I apologize to her anyway? Her friend thinks I should, but Brittany thinks I shouldn't, and nobody cares if the friend (left unnamed in respect) and I do not get along. Should I apologize if I am right? What do you all think? More tomorrow. Probably about a different subject.  In Christ, Mike  But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart." - 1 Samuel 16:7 NIV
