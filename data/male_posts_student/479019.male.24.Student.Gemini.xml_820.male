Apparently there are random passersby, and I know there are friends that come more regularly than others; however, I really need to have a better way of keeping track of who's lurking out there.  Now playing: NOFX - "Franco Un-American"  So I was chatting with Melissa today while I was waiting for the bus and I mentioned that I can somewhat be myself around her. That's actually half true... in that I'm one of my two very different personalities around her. I'm the crazier and more immature Albert around her. I'm more like the person I am back in California, than the person I am when I'm here... when I talk to her. This has to do with the fact that I think she can understand me, better than the other graduate students who are further along in their lives and want different things in life.  Now playing: Dropkick Murphys - "This is Your Life"  See the thing is here I don't have my  Posse , nor do I have the inspiration for my "madness" simply because my reputation didn't really follow me here. People here didn't see what I did in high school, no one was there in Vegas, nor present to what I've done at parties, witness the stage dives and action in the pit. People here see a much more mature version of Albert... a version that is perhaps not quite ready to take over control of my life.   I'm such a pussy... the real me would have gone to Albany to see  Pennywise  instead of going to Walmart.  Now playing: Sublime - "40 oz. to Freedom"  I have a lot of work to do... after Teen Titans  ***
