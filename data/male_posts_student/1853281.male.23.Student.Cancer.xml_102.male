Anyways, here it is the weekend and for the first time in probably months i have no plans...gaaaaaaah....what am i going to do, how am i going to occupy myself? well, tomorrow i am spending some time with mutti, and then Running on Empty is playing a show with Ass on sunday(for time/place e-mail me and i will let you know) and i think i will go, but i am starved fer fun. I have been good and stayed in all week, and so i really need to let my hair down....grrrr....trust me to leave things until the last minute. sixty degrees and sunny, nice launch into the weekend
