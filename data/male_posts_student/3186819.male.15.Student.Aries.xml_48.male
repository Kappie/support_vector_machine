She said "later". When "later" came she signed it. Then I told her I needed her to sign a note saying that she gives me permission to:  Drop Math and go to Applied Grade 9 Math next year (see previous post) Switch Academic Math, Grade 10 to Applied Math, Grade 10 Switch Food and Nutrition for Music  And she said she was sick of signing notes! Finally, when I said "Please" she signed it. Try please. It will work*.  *By reading this you agree to indemnify Robert A.
