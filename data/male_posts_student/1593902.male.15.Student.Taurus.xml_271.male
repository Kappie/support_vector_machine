Tell him what you need to and what you want to.   Don't hold back, there's no reason to.   Hold him and kiss him.  Do not leave something in the air.  Don't regret anything  My grandmother on my dads side loved and adored me (like the rest of the family) but I was so young i didn';t understand things well, i was liek 9 , i rather go out and play video games than hang with her.  Now there's a ton of stuff i wish i could tell her and i got SHIZNIT chances to tell her.  My other grandmother's sick, I dfound out a week ago, and i hadn't even thought about it..  this is the only one of my grandparents i truly know, and i love her, that'll be a major blow.  I still remember my mother crying over her dad.   Brandy when he leaves that house, as he's leaveing tell him this: I'll see you August 14th.  Because I know I will.
