I was cleaning up my files and found these and more.  These are the ones I thought you'd all like, or at least, I'd like.  I'll be posting much more but thats all for now...  A PS for the prom couple, I forgot to say, that is all DUCK TAPE... they are the winners of the 2003 Stuck at the Prom Contest hosted by Maco Duck Tape.  Hundreds and Hundreds of people enter each year.  Rules: Make a tux and dress of all duck tape and take a picture.  The best couple wins a $2500 scholarship... Would anyone be interested in going to the prom with me in a Duck Tape Dress?? I will make it for you, you just have to be guttsy enough to wear it and look like you're having a good time... You will forever be my hero if you agree to go with me...  Sorry Gentalmen, but I need a girl to go with me, I dont' think anyone you would look to great in a dress...  Also, if any of you know where I can get a Gnome like the one from Amelie or the one in our ANV picture, please let me know cause that would just make my day from now 'til forever...  Until later...  -Dan V
