The beautiful homie Gayle and some of her friends were nice enough to let me roll down to the ATL with them....the ride was smooth....I was privy to some girl talk which is always funny at the least....and all the ladies were beautiful so that always helps....they were staying at the Doubletree on Cobb Parkway and I've obviously slept on this place for a while....the interior is like a French Quarter style veranda deal....ballingest to the extreme...they had a jacuzzi style tub, which is all you need for the Killa to be happy....I would never leave the room....  Anyway Gayle dropped me off at the crib and I walk in and see my pops who wasn't expecting me...it was great....he's looking real good....and walking around and what not...we talked for awhile...I showed he and my mom some pictures that I had taken....Nina came home and she took me to Popeyes cuz her brother was hungry....caught up with my nigga Rashard and I got up to date on all the Westlake (my high school alma mater) news....then the homie Nile came by and we decided to see what Buckhead had to offer....  I went to the Metropolitan Pizza Bar and my cousin's boyfriend Lou saw me from outside and came and holla'd at me....then my homies Ray G'z, Will, and Larkins popped up....it was great seeing the three of them....those were three of my closest friends at Morehouse and I was glad to see that all was going well....Nile decided to dance with this big rutish looking white girl who it turns out was a power forward for Wisconsin's Women's B-Ball team....I laughed at that fool....but we had alot of fun....  Saturday morning I was up kinda early...got two slices of bacon and headed to my bank which happens to be in the middle of Publix on Cascade road....inevitably I run into someone I know....this time it was a family that my family is really cool with....the husband works for a local radio station and helps with Morehouse's homecoming yearly, being the good alum that he is....the wife is from a city near my mom's hometown and used to date my uncle waaaaay back in the day....they have two little girls that convinced  urlLink my little sister Che  to give up babysitting as a money making venture....  Then me and my dad went to the Morehouse football game....I saw some good old faces (Coach Nix, John Kelley, Officer Davidson, John Terrell, Cool ass Beth, etc.)....but the highlight was easily the people sitting about 3 feet from me....now understand I don't jock any type of movie star....but I have to say it was wild sitting next to Denzel Washington (who's son had a good day rushing the football for the victorious Maroon Tigers, 24-17, in a sloppy contest against Bowie State) and someone who I never really figured was that cool with Denzel, Mr. Wesley "Blade" Snipes....yes Shadow and Bleek were kicking it at the Morehouse game....and yes Bobby (as in Bobby Digital my digital camera) captured it all....I also got lots of pictures of the cheerleaders....rekindling my love/hate relationship with the Maroon Tiger Cheerleaders (All love right now)....  Me and pops went to the tent where his homies hang out....they all made him feel pretty special and whatnot....I think it was a good experience for him....we had a few beers and some good food....and all in all had fun....I came home....caught a nap and then the homie Rashard came by....we went to Nile's and hooked up with him, Maurice, and Playboy Reg....I'll post about the dynamics of all of that later on this week....as we were leaving we got up with the homie Cauthen and hit the liquor store....then headed to the lovely Nicole's house....  Nicole had pizza for us and we all kicked back and chilled and laughed about old times....it was great....even though we were teased by an expected, but unfulfilled visit by our friends Tiffany and the lovely, elusive LaToya.....man Latoya is on a short list with Elenda and about 2 other girls from Westlake I'd like to "run into" and catch up on old times with....anyway.....I flirted hard with Nicole....she knows I have a crush on her....she's got it going on....and she's a homeowner now too!.....oh...just give me a chance!!!  Anyway....we went to a homie of Nile's birthday party....there were alot of people there...unfortunately they all knew each other and I knew none of them....that's not my kinda thing....so I bounced....  All in all it was a great weekend....back to the Nashville grind tomorrow....I leave out at 6 in the morning....and that is 4 hours from now....better get some sleep....
