(by the by, when i say "my friend" from now on, i am referring to her; i don't wanna use her name cuz, well, i don't have permission to invade her privacy in that manner... O_o)   anyway, i figure friendship is based on our different needs from people. i'm not saying our sole purpose for making or having friends is our own personal need, it's just that, we need certain things from other people. confused? just read on a bit...  Legend: [type of friend]- [number i currently have in UP]/[minimum number i need] [description, stuffs, whatever] *note: all the left-side ones are filled in by  urlLink my one current friend , just so you know...*  the twisted tendencies friend- 1/1 me: so like, my mom says there aren't too many relatives left in her mother's side of the family cuz they were all butchers... friend: ...so, what happened? did they all fall into this giant meat grinder and come out as hamburgers??!? me: err, no, they had heart disease from eating so much pork. that was my first hypothesis, though... hehehe... my friend fits rather well into this description. more couldn't hurt though...  the basketball friend- 0/1 me: tangna dude lakas ni yao kagabi! friend: wak ka ganyan pare... lam naman natin pareho c stevie nagpapanalo sa kanila e! not the kind who yaps on and on about lay-ups and post moves and stuff like that, just the kind who watches the nba.  the obscure music friend- 0/1 me: baby when i heard you... friend: ...for the first time i knew... chorus: ...we were meant to be as one... my musical tastes are not that poppy; i like some stuff that no one else does. dati may friend akong trip din c kylie minogue, mga trance, etc. you know, stuff like that, but she was also really into 90s pop rock/grunge plus hip hop and rnb. aww yeah! sana lang talaga makatagpo ako ng nilalang na nakikinig ng mga kanta ng audioslave na wala sa radyo/tv...  the conyotic friend- 0/1 friend: my golly goshness, it's like, so grabe talaga, so kadiri nga eh! it's like, ewww! i'll never make kain that talaga! me: erm, yeah, sure. so totally. haler?! wala lang. trippy eh.  the video gamer friend- 0/3 friend: dude ano tekken tag?! me: ulul! tangna asa pa! boy bano ka naman tsong e! friend: pak u ka pare... no match ka sakin boy! no mats! oo, ganyan talaga magsalita ang mga maaangas na video gamer tulad ko. haay... kakamis!  the coffee friend- 1/1 the coffee friend has no specific dialogue; qualifications only require that my coffee friend agree to have coffee with me from time to time. hindi pa official yung 1 na yan since di pa naman kami nagkakaron ng actual coffee appointment, pero may usapan na kami, and so far, negotiations seem to be doing ok.  the trekkie friend- 0/1 me: live long and prosper. friend: that is irrelevant. i will not comply. you will be assimilated.  the RPGer friend- 0/1 friend: hail, o master of torment and irreverence! i bid thee good tidings on this most beautiful night of nights! me: hail, maiden of the moonlight! to what dost we mortals owe the honor of thine presence? perchance the land of eternal rain no longer require so great and powerful a mistress as thee?  the pure angst friend- 0/1 me: i hate my life. friend: lucky bastard. i hate the world. i hate the fact that we exist in the first place. i hate everyone. i hate myself. i want to die. me: kewl. wanna have lunch? friend: ok.  the pseudo-poet spaced-out friend- 0/1 me: oh, it's raining... friend: the rain... like angels' tears falling from the heavens, wishing our sins be purged... don't you love how it does that? how it seems to wash everything clean? how it seems to purify our souls by merely living out its purpose? i love the rain... in the end, we are all like that, you know... we are all but drops of rain... me: oh no, it's not raining. oh my! ang late na pala! andyan na pala ang buwan. friend: the moon... floating so high above us... me: ...ok, i get it. psycho.  the "make fun of everything" friend- 1/4 anyone who watches iron chef qualifies for this, but keep in mind, that is not a pre-requisite. basically, we make fun of everything.   the girlfriend- 0/1 and only 1 i'm 17 m qc, i'm a math major in UP Diliman, i will love you but good. miscol me at 09********* i'm h*t and h*rny no gays pls thx O_o *shivers* i seriously hope you knew i was kidding... you knew that, right?! God! how dense could you get??!? oops! did i say that out loud? *no wonder i'm still single... >_  and that will be all for now. if i remember anything else i might follow this all up sometime.  what have i learned? one month has passed and i'm still alone... not completely, but in a lot of ways... *screams "i'm tired of being alone/so hurry up and get here"*  completely wrong thought of the day: "i hate butterflies! i hate the sun! i hate vast grassy meadows with yellow and pink flowers! i hate little children playing in a brook with crystal clear waters! there is no joy in life; there is only pain! do you hear me?! THERE IS ONLY PAAAAAIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!" -an exaggerated thought from the mind of my friend  urlLink jam . ayan ha! andami mo nang endorsement sa blog ko! wahahahaha! yes, i know, you never asked for that, pero ala lng, andaming beses ko kasi nagamit ang pangalan mo eh... wahahahaha...
