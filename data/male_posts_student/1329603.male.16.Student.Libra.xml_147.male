Laura's been on, she's introduced me to Ging who is more talented than me, and 'prettier' than me, so I'm kind of feeling insecure there. Ohh *cries* I'm not in a good mood.  I also got hacked which has kind of made me buggered emotion-wise.  I've been given a guilt trip for not wanting to hurt someone.  Please help me. I'm not good at this.
