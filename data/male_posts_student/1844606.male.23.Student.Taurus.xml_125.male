You know what, I'm pretty damn sick of songs that constantly have whining/lyrics about how much women suck. Basically take a look at MTV's "rock" countdown and the problem exposes itself in full motherfreaking efffizzzzect.   I'm thinking of some song titled "I hate everything about you" or something really creative like that.  Band name is not important, they are all the same.  I think the "creative" process went one of two ways....  "artistic" vision  Damn, that girl just dumped me cause I suck.  Fucking bitch.  I hate everything about her.  I've got so much angst, but I just can't express it.  I hate everything about her.  Wait... (shitty, detuned song written)  "corporate" influence  Guy with cheesy ponytail talking to band in studio    "fellas.  The new record is absolutely 'kickin'  But I don't know if its reaching the key demographic of disenchanted 12 to 17 year old males.  Now, what I want is someone, you mowhawk kid you have a good enough face, yeah you'll work as the lead singer.  We need to tap that angst.  But don't do anything too subtle, we are dealing with teenagers here.  We need really literal lyrics  band members ask for definition of "literal"  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  I would also like a cool girl.  Non-neurotic, understanding funny, attractive.  It seems like so little.  The ability to wail  The ability to sing  Good paying job  Inspiration  Inner Peace  thats all for now
