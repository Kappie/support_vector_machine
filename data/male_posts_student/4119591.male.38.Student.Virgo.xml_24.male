This little device broadcasts the audio from my iPod to any nearby (optimally within three feet) FM radio. (You remember FM radio, right?)    The iTrip comes packaged with a collection of "songs" in the form of mp3 files. Each "song" is about five seconds long and contains a short burst of bleeps that tell the iTrip on which frequency to transmit. So, for instance, if you want the iTrip to broadcast on 94.1MHz, you simply play the iTrip 94.1 "song." It is really only necessary to play the first few seconds of the song to make it work... In fact, I discovered that if I played the entire song, it wouldn't work.  A small  red  LED (the manual says  blue ) provides some limited feed back on whether or not the iTrip received commands. You can use one of the songs to turn the LED off. I did this to conserve battery power. Despite what the Griffin marketing collateral says, the iTrip does have a serious impact to battery life. The good news is that it draws its power from the built-in iPod battery and can be charged while still attached.  So finally there's a station on a radio near me (very near me) that plays the songs I picked out and doesn't have a bunch of yapping "personalities" and commercials. It is bliss, I'm telling you! I really needed this. Couldn't live without it, in fact. More important than food and shelter.  Or not.
