We came in to a horribly dirty and cold house because my g-pa had left the fireplace open and a bird got in and did alot of damage. There was crap everywhere and it ate all the brownies :( but its ok because they were chocolate brownies and it died up stairs in the bathroom because of the chocolate it ate. But o well now its less then a week until BDB tryouts and im getting more and more scared because there might be tryouts for the hornline now which i had planned to do after i tried out for the drumline (my moms making me) but neways this week i have to practice for drums and horns so that i know enough. But if all else fails ill play cymbals i dont have a problem with it id just rather march contra then cymbals and if that doesnt end up working there is also aux. pit percussion or timpani but i do really want to march but ill do nething to march a corps this year.
