I also think i puked due to tha fact that im sick.ANyhow after i puked i was calm and i started thinking and well my mind came up with a Thank's fr putting up with me so here you go and so my mind came up with this crappy story plot about love,revenge,Atlantis,the sea god,Re-incarnation, divine winter witches/guardians, i have an idea of the story plot.This is what i have so far the Witch/guardian( don't have a name yet)Fell in love with the sea god and so did the sea god. The were madly in love with each other until the people of altlantis weakend and destroyed him.... it goes on so I''l just say it plainly she attacks and destroys atlantis, other  countries hear of what the guardian did and so the people threaten to go to war with them so the guardians not wanting to go to war forever decide to kill the one who destroyed atlantis, and start with that guardian from the begining.So they do, but what nobody knows about them is that wether they all die they will return becouse that's how they go on they are all the re-incarnations of the original guardian's, so wether they are killed the will be guardians forever until the end of time. Same with the sea god reborn again but not as a god. That's what i have so far im thinking of changing some stuff it sounds kinda crappy but you could never know. On some lighter subject it's the 4th of july yipee, not really it's just another excuse for people to get drunk as hell and accidenatlly burn up someones house wit fireworks, fireworks are cool but when you get outside there are alot of idiot's who do the most stupid thing's with fireworks, such as oh i wonder what happen's if i aim this to the floor ? this is not a lie ive actually heard people say this with fireworks and i'm like oh my god. Im almost temppted to go to a public place and say" "hey whose ridding the shooting star headed towards us". That's just mean but funny nonetheless, i don't know i wouldn't want to cause hysteria among the crowd.
