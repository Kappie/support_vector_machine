Yes the PGA's good ol' boy who claimed that he was gonna give everyone a run for their money at the Masters didn't even make the cut. But we can't blame John for this i mean, his wife was just convicted of money laundering and he was probably smashed by the 9th hole anyway.     urlLink SI.com - Mickelson's major pursuit ends with Masters - Sunday April 11, 2004 6:47PM
