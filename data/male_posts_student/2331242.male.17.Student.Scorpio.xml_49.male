My dad cut me off half way through, so I asked if the nice survey lady could call back in 30 minutes.... but she hasn't called yet. Why does my dad have to be so damn rude like that? I felt, for the first time in a long time, that I was  important . Oh well, I guess delaying dinner by 10 minutes when my mom wasn't even home was too high of a price to pay for the woman's convenience and my happiness.   :\
