Setting on top of the motor is a Holley 650 carburetor bolted to a Edelbrock intake. Bolted to the back of the motor is a Muncie 3 speed manual transmission, and the rear end is the only original thing on the car. For more information about my dad's car, I have setup a  urlLink website  where I can post photos from trips that we take in the car.  In about 10 or 12 hours I will more than likely be in the garage waxing the front of the car so that bugs won't bake into the paint job on the hood when we go to Idaho. We will be driving this car over 2,000 miles to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho for the 2004  urlLink Bowtie/ Late Great Chevy  International convention without air conditioning, what fun! Yep, that right, no air conditioning because the motor runs "too hot" as it is, and adding air conditioning would probably fry the thing. Get this- while driving 5 MPH in a parade our car temperature gage is halfway between C & H, however, when driving 80 MPH down the interstate in third gear the gage is leaning on H and you can smell anti-freeze. My mechanic father and I believe that the shaft in the water pump (which the fan blade is bolted to) is slipping at higher RPMs, thus pumping less anti-freeze/ water through the motor. At lower RPMs, however, the slippage is less, thus causing virtually no change in water temperature.
