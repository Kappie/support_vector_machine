Which brings me to my moral lesson of the day.    Oh, btw... moral lessons... that reminds me... Why does Jerry Springer think it is neccessary to have a moral message at the end of every show. Most of the people on that show are white trash as most of the people who watch the show are and they don't care what you have to say. Jerry Springer just needs to learn that when people watch his show they want to see fat chicks get naked and try to kick some other fat chick's ass for sucking her man off...   Final Thought this bitch.
