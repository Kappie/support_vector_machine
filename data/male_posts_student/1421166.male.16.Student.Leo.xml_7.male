Then only 16 people passed Chemistry, Mr Wong said( he didn't want to let us know the marks yet.) But fortunately, I was one of the 16 who passed!!! Praise the Lord! I'm so blessed! Actually, I'm always blessed by God. OK, enough boasting about my results. hehe... Last night, about my bill, I was surprised that nobody scolded me at all. Really thankful. Then didn't felt stressed about my paper today at all...so just kept watching TV...and managed to catch Smallville. Then there was this scene of Cloe deleting pictures of Clark and herself on the computer. haiz...somehow reminded me of myself sometime back...haiz...shouldn't talk about it. Ya, but seriously, it's quite a nice, reflective show. So can I borrow Dustin's Smallville VCD please??? hehe...Ya, missed season one. Then I came home early today again, but not to study actually, cause my sisters and ZQ were watching Harry Potter. So once again, I was distracted. But I think I'll study later. And come to think of it, I have tons of E.math homework...haiz...and tomorrow's Physics paper. After all the good tidings, I'm finally going to fail one subject. Today, decided to start reading my book again. Talking about friendship with sisters-in-Christ in this chapter. Then he said, a friendship is when two people move towards a common goal. Then start to think what common goal I have with some of the sisters. And concluded, what he said was not necessarily true, cause my jie and me don't really have common goal what (well, maybe just that I don't know) and not like we're in love or something. So I have my own stand. Yeah...so what is friendship? hmm...ok...I'll go think about it. But any opinions, do tell me k? Send to my email: han48seeker@hotmail.com  Today, was very a very tiring day, probably cause I stayed up to watch Smallville last night...hehe...but yippee!!! I can go play basketball tomorrow night, cause it's Labour Day on Thursday! Feel like watching a movie. Matrix Reloaded will be out soon, so should I watch both X-men 2 and Matrix Reloaded??? Hmm...OK...don't care...see first la. OK gotta go finish my homework on Simlar Triangles(crap topic!)
