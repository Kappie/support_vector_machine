This weekend should give me enough time to recover myself. :D Not being at your job can really make you feel pathetic in a way, but then again you can enjoy things you couldn't if you were working. Things like saying all sorts of bullshit in a virtual place. LOL!  Well anyway, I'm still on my first coffee today, so don't  try  to understand me, cuz that would really be impossible.
