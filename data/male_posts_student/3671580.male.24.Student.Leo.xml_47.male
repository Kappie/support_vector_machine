I had pretty low expectations for the film, but was pleasantly surprised in that it actually was pretty funny.    I thought the high point of the film was Jason Bateman's performance as Pepper Brooks, the color commentator for the ESPN 8 telecast of the dodgeball tourney.  Bateman perfectly captures the role of the inane commentator that one all to often finds on professional sport broadcasts.  On a different note, I was disappointed by the audience's failure to pick up on a hilarious joke involving the German dodgeball team.  I won't spoil it for anyone, but I thought it was very subtle, and well done.  I'll try to post some pics in a bit.
