Dottie took me because big Mike is out of town and mom had to come home to work on something for work. Dottie had to get somethings so we walked around and bought some stuff and I ran into a handful of people. First, right after I got my coffee I had to take a leak and as I was walking into the bathroom I ran into Coach Kincaid. Took care of business and left and started walking around. A little later, after running into Coach numerous more times, I was looking at stuff that you put in your dorm room and Sarah walked by. I said, really loud 'Hey look it's Sarah!' I guess she didn't hear me because she kept walking. I poked my head out from the isle I was standing in and yelled 'Watch out for Coach Kincaid, Sarah!' She growled, lol, and kept walking with her infamous cell phone in her hand. I think she thinks I am obsessed with her or I'm a stacker. I'm not! Just want to be friends with everyone! heh If running into Sarah wasn't enough, we got in the checkout line and Sarah's sister was walking by and she was talking to Sarah on her cell phone. Then I turned and saw, I think it was, Sarah's mother then I turned again and spotted a girl named Christy walking out of the store. I couldn't remember her name until later so I didn't yell it out or anything. Then leaving the checkout lane I think I spotted one of the Holt twins. Then it got a little creepy seeing everyone and we left. Oh yeah, we almost ran out of gas on the way to her dropping me off at my house. We got gas so it was all good. So that's all I have to say. lol I pre-ordered the new John Mayer cd today too! Can't wait to get it! I have a countdown already counting down to the September 9 release date. I bought the 'bundle package' so I get a cool t-shirt with it when it comes. Good stuff. It was a good day. Cleaned my room, ordered the cd I was just talking about, went to Starbucks, the only thing that wasn't good was Sarah not noticing me. This is going to sound lame but why can't everyone see that I'm a cool kid worth hanging out with? lol I'll leave you with that I guess. G-day mate!
