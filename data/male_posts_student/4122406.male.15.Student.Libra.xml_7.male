As they were going to be clearing the drains as well, we were asked to move all the cars off the street. So I woke up this morning to see a street completely empty of cars - a sight which probably hasn't been seen since 1930's maybe. Anyway, they're done now, but I don't see any difference. I havn't actually been down to the street yet, so there may be some things I didn't see. It will be interesting to see how long the street takes to become dirty again.
