I work at my school LSH, a private catholic school, to help my mom pay off tuition. It's an ok job but I don't get any of the money. I wish I did because there are so many things I could do with it. Anyways lets continue with the story.  I had a choice and I picked I would stay home. I don't know why it pisses off my mom so much when she is the one that gave me the choice. She has been really pissed at me lately which makes my day bad and puts me in a more worse mood. All she has been doing lately is yelling at me. Like when I woke up this morning.  I've had my mom wake me up in the morning lately because I haven't been able to. I told her last night to wake me up around 7:30 so she starts waking me up around 7:00 because I'm a heavy sleeper. That's fine I don't care but then when I finally woke up at 7:34 she yelled at me because I told her to wake me up at 7:30 and I wasn't waking up, I was going to be late to work (LOL), blah blah blah. It was only 4 minutes after I had asked her to wake me up. Come on give me a break. "Throw me a frickin bone!" in the words of Dr. Evil.  Oh well I'm up for the day. Maybe I will get around to posting more about myself....Maybe not we will see. Live long and prosper....
