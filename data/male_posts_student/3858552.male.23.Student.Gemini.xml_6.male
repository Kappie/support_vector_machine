Jade is all pissed off and hates me, I actually tried being a nice person to her like everyone says I should, but where does it get me.. nowhere.  I am so ready to be out of this horrible state and on to bigger and better things.  About Jade, I have really hated her since she started this Brian guy, she's such a bitch to me and has no intrest in doing things with the rest of us.  Maybe it's from the drug use of her's lately, but ever since Matt went to Grenada and then came back, she's a totally different person.  We all used to have fun when we'd smoke and sit around talking crazy shit together, but now we smoke and she sees how many time she can sneak a bitch remark into the conversation about me.  Like tonight, saying to jennifer "watch out, you may end up like me and then be unable to pay bills and have to move out."  Well i'll say this in response..  Who the hell does she think she is.. does she think that it is ok to bring cocaine into the house when she knows how some people feel about that shit.  At any rate, I am really ready to just get out of this lease and find somewhere else to live and I don't know if she sees that or even cares.  Anyways, I'm not gonna kill my buzz by sitting here harping on this for now.   A happier note for the day, I made peace with my grandmother after we got into it in April.
