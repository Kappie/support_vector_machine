However, instead of pants, I found this (complete with link, if you click on the picture)....   urlLink     Didn't have quite so much luck finding a cake, but it prob'ly wouldn't taste the same, anyway (what with the monitor getting in the way, and all).   So, you're old today, huh? Not quite as old as the Monkey and Bob, but still getting pretty close. Borderline "no longer a young whippersnapper." One of these days, we'll be able to call you an old geezer, too (meaning it only in the best of ways, of course). Anywho, I hope this day is everything you dreamed it would be and more. You truly are one of the most wonderful people I have ever known and deserve only the best. Happy Birthday, hon.   ~Manda
