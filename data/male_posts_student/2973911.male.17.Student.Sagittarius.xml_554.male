Although not completely patronized by the TRUE makers, it saves a whole lot of shit. I can't believe you are going to get that friggin' car through the highway. Not that I'm trying to say your a bad driver.... well... okay. Maybe I think you are. A little. Okay, maybe not so little. My point being is, I hope you have evaluated the risks you are willing to take in life. Me? I could always risk a good car ride with a friend. Why aren't you at home, anyway? Sherwin said you've met with him earlier. Damn! I wish I could've gone nitro with that car of urs.  Hey, the more I grow old, the better I realize that I live longer than I have expected.
