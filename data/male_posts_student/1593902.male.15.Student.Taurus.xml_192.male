You look in the dustbin for something to eat, You find a dead rat and you think it's a treat, In your Liverpool slums In your Liverpool slums, You shit on the carpet, you piss in the bath, You finger your grandma, and think its a laugh, In your Liverpool slums. In your Liverpool slums, You speak in an accent exceedingly rare, You wear a pink tracksuit and have curly hair, In your Liverpool slums. In your Liverpool slums, Your mum's on the game and your dad's in the nick, You can't get a job 'cos you're too fucking thick, In your Liverpool slums.
