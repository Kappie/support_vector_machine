 Damn, my cat got killed today by some damned dogs. This stray cat that had adopted our family and had become our house cat had been out for the past few days and Terry found him today injured after being attacked by some dogs. He and Mom took Thomas out to the Rivergate emergency vet clinic but he died on the way out there. Mom just called and told me. 
 Damn, what's up with rainy nights and our cats getting killed by dogs. Back in October of 2002, another cat, Charlie, was attacked by dogs pretty much right in front of me and died soon. That fucking sucked. Well, so does this, I really liked Thomas. In fact, I'm kinda surprised he got caught by dogs because he's such a nervous cat and all. Well, he was such a nervous cat. Damn, this fucking sucks. Oh yeah, like with Charlie, Mom has paid the vets to cremate the cat without allowing me to say goodbye. 
 Also, tomorrow is my last full day of high school, period. I think I'm gonna go to my room now and lay down.
