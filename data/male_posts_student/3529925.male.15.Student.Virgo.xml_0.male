I think I might start a short story on this blog or something to that effect. That could prove to be interesting. However, I'm not really planning on having people read this, becuase, of course, my main source of advertisment (AIM) has been effectively axed my my asshole of a dad (not all the time mind you, but he is being adamant in his arbitrary conjecture that my brother and I don't need AIM).Anyway..I'm up once again.
