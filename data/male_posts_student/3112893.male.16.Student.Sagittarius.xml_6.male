That's all I have to say for now... aside from the usual random bitching and whining.  Here's a sample: There's never any damn food ready around this freakin' place. I have to actually open a can of soup and HEAT IT UP!! Do you have any idea how stressful it is to have to worry about things like the dirty pan or what to do with the can once I've put the soup in the pan for heating? It's absurd what they expect me to do around here.  Also, what ever happened to respect of personal space? I mean, jeez, is it too much to ask for a 10 foot radius? Sure, I live in a 600 Sq. foot place, share it with three other people, and occupy ~12+% of the place with my furniture, books, and instruments, but shit! I need my desk cleared of EVERYONE ELSE'S CRAP... even though it's the only surface for putting things aside from the floor, kitchen or dining room tables (both of which are taken up by food and decorations. I'd put up a picture but I don't have a good digital camera.).  Further more, why is my stuff such a mess? Really, I should have a personal slave clean all this up FOR ME! Why when I work as much as I do on important problems like removing semi-useful features from Mac OS X.3.4 am I also required to clean up after myself? I swear to god other people can NOT have to deal with this! It's just rediculous.  I'm 16, I'm important and I deserve everything good that comes my way and think that everything bad is just an unjust authoritarian figure out to get me.  Ok, that was a joke. All of that was a joke. I don't think that any of what was just said is reasonable. To be honest, I'm actually feeling pretty good. Today was not as productive as I would have liked, but only I am to blame for I was the one who decided to spend most of it trying to take out ME 262's relentless drive to make sure Finder is always running (even after I killed Finder).  Well, I guess now's a good a time as any to study for those damn SAT's. I hate the College Board for everything it does, and that's not because I can't ace this piece of shit. It's that I don't feel I should have to to make my case to MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Cal-Tech, and Berkeley.  That is all.         -- Feanor
