"Yeahhhhh soooooo....what do you guys want to do now?"  They act like the silence offends them, they can't stand for it and it's just so 'NOT COOL'.  There always needs to be Action, FUN, drama, excitement. Sitting and contemplating is just so "boring" and "dull". You know what, I agree with you.  But words spoken that aren't "forced" are so much more honest, and honorable.  Have you ever had a nice conversation with an adult and hit some silence? Did either of you comment on how "bored" you are now?.....I don't think that happens so often. But why?  I don't talk a lot. Anyone who hangs around with me can easily understand this. It might change one day, but if so--it probably won't be for a while...  I've been called "boring", referred to as "the guy just sitting there in the corner", or "seeming like i'm just not there"...but I have also been called "interesting", "fun", and.. "the kid with the hair". So who am i supposed to believe?
