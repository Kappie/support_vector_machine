"Reconcillation" means reconciling, coming back from something, bringing back the trust  faith... Now, if paganism is a religion, who are they trying to reconcile with? The god of evil or another god that i haven't heard about? No offense, anyways... ^_^  Now you understand why i can't be and shouldn't be in your puzz?
