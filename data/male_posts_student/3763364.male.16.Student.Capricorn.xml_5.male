This ridiculous and perplexing fad is characterized by looking and acting gay, but not actually being gay. The fringe benefits of homosexuality, but without the anal-sex. What fringe benefits, you ask? Well, for starters, women LOVE gay men, they are polite, fashionable, well-groomed, well-mannered, in touch with their emotions and overall, just good company for women. A gay guy is the bestest best girlfriend you never had, ladies.  My only beef about this current fad is that I invented it three years ago!!!  All of grade nine I got teased for beinga "fag" and I wasn't even gay! Now that I think back, I sure as hell dressed like it, and sure as hell acted like it, but I never once dated a guy! Here the networks are, making millions of all them guy-makeover shows....Dammit.  I really truly invented it though! Ask any of my female friends, they all refer to me as their girldriend! In fact, more than half of my friends are girls. They say I'm different than any of their other guy friends, I can talk about my feelings, I can go shopping with them, I can go into the lingerie store and pick out bras with them if the need should arise! Some of them regard me as one of their closest friends simply because of the special metro-guy-to-female bond that we share.  Those millions are mine! MINE I SAY!  But then again, what if 10 years down the road, I turn out the be actually gay? Ugh, no way, men are god damned pigs. Hahah.   Does anybody watch that "Queer as Folk" show? No, it's not another make over show, it's a Showcase series about gay dudes. Now I know for sure I've been watching too much Showcase. I think it's an incredibly good take on the lives of gay men in this day and age. Unlike Will and fucking Grace. That has to be the worst portrayal of gay men I have ever seen. This one is more realistic and more down to earth. Why just last nite, this trans-sexual got beaten toa bloody pulp by some other guys. The odds of something like happen, I think, are quite real enough to be scary.  I know that if I were gay, I would be afraid to be open about it. Even in our free nation, homosexuals are antagonized all of the time. By the government, by their friends, by even just random people. Some people are so against the subject of homosexuality that to even mention it upsets them. The church views it as a sin.  There was this girl in my Career And Life Management class who was openly gay. We were having a class discussion about homosexuality, and the subject of violence towars gays was brought up. Most of the class had the idea in their head that our school was quite an open and tolerant environment, and that such opression did not occur. So then she pipes up and says "Are you fucking kidding me!? I have permanent bruises on my hips and shoulders from being punched and shoved into lockers!!!" That sure shut the class the hell up.  I bet you if I told my family, even jokingly, that I was gay, that they would disown me right that very instant.  Society itself would shun me, and I would be pushed into somewhat of an underground community with the rest of the homosexuals of this proud, proud nation. If I were to go into a regular bar with my boyfriend, hold hands, neck, ordo whatever, do you think the owner, let alone the patrons, wouldn't kick our asses or kick us out? I think we would end up at a gay bar. And there we would have to stay, in the shadows of society. Jesus, Ralph Klein opposes gay marriages. We would be even less like everyone else in that, even if we loved each other, we wouldn't be able to get married. Some land of the free this is.  I however, admire the gay community of this nation for their courage. They brave opression from damn near everyone, and remain adamant in their quest for utmost freedom. But wait, I thought they were already free? NOT. There are a lot more than laws to change before they can be truly set free. There are people. Millions and millions of people. Millions of homophobes. Millions uneducated on the subject.  Oh, and for the record,even though HIVfirst surfaced among gay males in America, that doesn't mean every homo is HIV positive, ya dumb bastards.    I'm metrosexual and damn proud of it!  *waves around slightly altered pride-flag*   Oh, and one more thing about that Queer as Folk show, ladies, there is plenty of guy-on-guy action...More than I care to see in any given day...But still.  Actually, I haven't really heard of a lot of women that get turned on by guy-on-guy action, whereas it's "every man's dream" to see two women goin at it.  Something I never quite understood....     "Life is not a lie if you believe it."     Apparently, that quote has something to with rationalization or something or other. Is life only what you make of it? What if you make it into something that it really, truly isn't? What if you're just assuming that it's one thing in order to rationalize your horrible actions. Is tofu really made out of Soy? Or is it just Play-Do?  I think a lie is a lie, believing it doesn't make it any more true (or not true)than it already is, and vise versa. Take, for example, Mr. Bush and his war on terrorism. Suppose his allegations that there were weapons of mass destruction, and that Iraq had ties to Al Queda were true, and not out-and-out lies. Then his war would indeed be justified either way, wouldn't it? Well, how about the fact that there are more dead Iraqiwomen and children because of the war than every single person that was killed in the world trade centre attack. I think he's crossed the line of justification, vindication, or revenge, or whatever you call it, and stepped into crusade territory.  Did you even see what they did to the city of Baghdad? They hammered that place with explosives until it was in shambles. What they did adds up to about 6 or 7 world trade centre attacks.  And ties to Al Queda!? So what!? All of America, and more notably, the Bush family has had ties to Al Queda for years. Military funding to Afghanistan...Transporting Al Queda officials out of the country....Harboring countless terrorists. America is as much to blame for the terrorist attacks as Iraq is. In fact, let's face it, America IS the terrorist. In every sense of the word. They have brought terror to this world.  Even if any of that bullshit was true or otherwise, a war is a war, and war is wrong. Therewas never any need to kill thousands of people.    "We criticize in others what we fear within ourselves."   However true or untrue this is, I think it applies rather well to me. I know that I'm always criticizing my friends for doing things wrong, like eating unhealthy or not excercising regularly, or not caring so much about the environment, etc. Perhaps it is because they still have a chance to save themselves from their flaws.   You know what I can't quite get over, even to this day? How the fuck did the Liberals win the 2004 election!? HOW!? I just don't get it! Who in their right mind would vote for fucking Paul Martin!? Bah.  Oh well, by the time the 2012 election rolls around, I will bea more-than-eligible cantidate.  But I'm not going to win the 2012 federal election with just sardonic wit and empty promises.  Oh, wait, YES I AM!!!  MUHAHAHAHAHAHAH!
