You know why?  Because, while I'm not getting a balanced perspective, I'm finally getting enough of one to see Europians for what they really are: fakes, thiefs, rip-offs.  Ungrateful, and often down right mean.  I had no idea how much revisionist history I'd been absorbing.  Europeans have only been the big players for  maybe  six hundred years.  The Chinese empire lasted like four times that long.  Dar Al Islam lasted almost twice that long.  But what do we learn about as kids?  The last 200 years.  The ones that involve America.  Maybe a little about Europe. I've been thinking a lot about my career plans, and I think I want to major in Medievil history and minor in theatre.  I'll probably still end up a teacher, but if I must teach, I'd rather teach history, and try and help kids get a somewhat better rounded view of the world.  Especially Islam.  If I were them, I'd be mad to.
