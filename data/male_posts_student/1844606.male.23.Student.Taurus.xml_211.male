Which now leaves me with absolutely 0 solid leads for gainful employment...Higher ed. is fab and so is the President.   I think this can sum up my current disposition:  There's a fortune inside your head All you touch turns to lead You think you might just crawl back in bed The fortune inside your head You know you're just a mama's boy Positively unemployed   Oh how JT is so right
