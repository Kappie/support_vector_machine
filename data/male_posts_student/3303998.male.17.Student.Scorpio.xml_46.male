Well, here's the deal, I was contimplating on moving in with my Grandmother, again, so, that I could finish school at Central. Well, that really didn't turn out, because she went and lied to all the people at my cousins open house and told them that, and I quote,"Andy hit me, and then he moved out." That id the biggest pile of bull. So, then, I ended up having to tell 80 different people the real story so they would quit coming up to me and asking me about what happened. Today, my mom calls me and tells me that I can move back down there with my friend, Michelle. Now, I'm just sitting here waiting for Michelle to call me after 6pm. That is when I'll know for sure if I'm going there to live or not. Until the next time I'm on. ciao.
