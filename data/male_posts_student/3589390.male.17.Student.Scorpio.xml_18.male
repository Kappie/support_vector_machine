Anyways, today after a long, extended absence of a few days from work,  I opened...and worked with this super awesome girl. She was extremely  polite, enthusiastic, smart, funny...pretty weird too, hm.. Anywho, I  thought we hit it off pretty well, but boys are fools, eh? I was  contemplating earlier about asking her out sometime, just to see a  movie, something free and simple right? I'm just not totally sure  though, she lives a bit far away, for someone who I don't think  drives...so it may be much asking her to get out to the theater,  hm..also we just met, so I'm not sure. It's just we won't be working  much together and I figured I might as well..who knows?      But yeah...that was today. La-la-la.
