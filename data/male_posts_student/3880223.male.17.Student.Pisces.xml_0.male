Just after a month, here I am, already ready to raise my white flag...  Hindi ko na kaya ang week na to...feeling ko any moment now sasabog na ako!!!  Sobrang dami ng requirements, so many teachers to please, so many people to meet, and so little time to do all of these things! I really don't know how to go on with this life...may punyetang play pa na dapat panoorin!   THE BAGOONG RICE  But anyway, what was really great about this week is our first Chem block lunch out in World Topps Katipunan. Everyone was there except for some few people (like Lovelyn) who were not able to go because of some unexplainable circumstances... But the good thing was, we had our first social bonding, and of course, the food was great. If not, truly tasty. The Kao Pad I ordered (Thai Bagoong Rice, that is) just made my day...plus I ate it using chopsticks...considering it's Thai...   WILL I SURVIVE?  Yes, I'm sure I will because this week is pretty much closing its doors...plus I get to eat more bagoong rice in the future...or perhaps I'll try there Katsudon or something...=)
