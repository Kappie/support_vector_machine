Parents getting in their face, sibling rivalries, heck, somebody I probably haven't even talked to yet is sicker than a mental picture of Rod Stewart getting it on with your mom.  (From the eating, not the mental picture.)  But my day has been okay.  Woke up, ate a little breakfast, gamed all freaking day, ate the traditional dinner, watched a DVD with dad and well, now I'm here.  I had a pretty good day.  So who pissed in everybody else's Cheerios?
