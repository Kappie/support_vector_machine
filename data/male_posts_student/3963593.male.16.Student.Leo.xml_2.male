(You may wonder why I call the poetry entries as spill, this is because I'm spilling all of my emotions on the screen for everyone to view and interpret themselves).   -MISTAKES   I'm sorry to lead you down this path,  The path with no truths,  Never ending in it's curves that trick and deceive.  Overwhelming in the untrained eye.   A missed chance, all it was,  The opportunity was there,  But I didn't answer your call.  Are jobs more important than true friends?   In a time of need,  I couldn't support one of the people that needed the most.  Instead I obliviously turned my head,  And gave the cold shoulder, without a thought.   Back in touch,  Discussion is necessary to clear this problem up.  You may not realize, but the effect is great.  To make others happy is second nature.   A mistake, that's all it was.  To forgive and forget, however,  A task that sounds so simple, is seemingly impossible.  You may not mind, but in troubled eyes, it was only a mistake.   -zack g.
