So today was by far the best day of break.  And it started out great because Tyke got up at 10.  That's right.  Tyke set his alarm and got up at 10AM so as to enjoy his day.  And boy did he.  Starting off the day was watching some good old Price is Right.  A down right well-done show.  Tyke took a nice little shower, shaved a little (really not a big beard guy if you can't tell), and then he made himself look good with a nice mix and match of clothes.  Then he got on the phone and called Macaroon.  Now listen to this...nobody answered.  It was 10:34 when he called.  And nobody answered.  Well later on Tyke called up again and this time Macaroon answered and they planned out how they were going to meet.  And then Tyke told him that he called earlier and Macaroon was like, oh that was you? i thought somebody else was gonna get it.  So this time...Tyke woke up Macaroon!!!  HA!  Take that!  At like noon Tyke got up and went to the ATM and got some money, then he met up with Macaroon at GameStop in Issaquah where they both were going to buy a game.  Tyke got ESPN NBA Basketball and that is a great game.  They went up to Macaroon's to play the two games and that was fun.  Dr. Phil Lelee came up and joined them as well.  They got hungry and tried to exchange Macaroon's game back at GameStop so they headed down there again.  When getting there Tyke saw an old friend of his from high school going to the same place so they caught up on old times a little and that was fun.  Then the boys went to Costco and Tyke got a great Hand Dipped Super Premium Ice Cream Bar with Roasted Almonds.  While eating Tyke saw the same friend from high school come by.  So they talked some more and then parted ways yet again for Tyke's house.  They played Tyke's basketball game there.  It was tons of fun.  First it was Tyke as the Sonics (with Chris Landreth on the team) against the Lakers.  The Lakers are hella good in that game though and they managed to pull out the win.  It was a good game but unfairly matched.  Tyke still lost though.  After that they did 24/7 mode which is hella tight.  They did that for hours.  And didn't get tired at all as they just kept taking turns.  After that they played another game.  It was Tyke as the 76ers this time versus the other two as the Kings.  And wow, was Peja Stojakovic ever good.  Now that Doc P and Macaroon had the release point down they were just draining impossible 3's with Peja.  He scored 63 points to lead all scorers.  But Tyke just kept getting foul shots and made 39 of 45.  That is good.  He kept it close and had a 3 point lead with seconds left.  To make it short, Peja made an incredible 3 at the buzzer to send it to OT and there the Kings took it easily winning by 8.  A great game again though.  Then the guys left and Tyke had dinner and hung out.  At 7:30 he headed up to Macaroon's where they met before going bowling.  They played some Soul Calibur II before leaving and that was fun.  Then they went to Hillcrest Bowl.  It was Tyke, Macaroon, Kinker, Dr. Phil, and Fejj on one lane and the other had Dui, Maniak, Samantha, and Skippy.  Singles versus couples.  Tyronious and Trew-fanator later came and made their own lane.  But Tyke bowled a little above par the first game.  But boy did he ever find his touch the second game.  Wow, he left one open frame the whole game, the 2nd frame he believes.  And twice (3 times maybe??) he had 2 straight strikes needing a third for the turkey but instead got spares.  He was on fire.  He ended up with a grand total of...just try and guess.  It was incredible.  203!!!!!!  203!!!!!  That is sooo good.  97 away from perfect.  His best game ever by far.  It was just a stellar performance.  The high game of the day in fact.  It said on the screen with Tyke Turner in big print.  It was funny.  He owned with that game.  Then they did a 2 losers buy two winners ice cream at Dick's in Seattle.  The person in 3rd place doesn't have to pay at all.  It was a great game.  Came down to the wire for 3rd place but Dr. Phil squeaked it out.  Macaroon blew and had to buy Kinker ice cream and Fejj had a valiant effort but he ended up having to buy Tyke ice cream.  While at Dick's they met some very interesting people to say the least.  Two guys just kept beat-boxing (or whatever it is called).  They were weird.  Pretty good but weird.  And this friend of theirs thought they were insanely messed up.  Then of course there were the "working girls" there and the homeless and the sluts and the whores and the poor and the everything (Tyke didn't mean to be mean with the "sluts and whores" but come on...).  Tyke was not in his usual environment.  He kept flexing his right butt cheek to make sure his wallet was still there.  No joke.  Dui seemed to find that comical but it was still the best idea in that situation.  He didn't want to move it to the front for fear of someone seeing that and either get offended and beat him up or get intrigued and beat him up.  Either way he didn't want to get beat up.  So then he came home and wrote an email.  Then he came and blogged.  What a great day.  Great day.
