I need Daniel to help tell me what the real words are. I got barely any sleep, track was hard, school was easy... me and Paul convinced alot of people in track that we were really fighting when it was a whole setup... WOOPS! I meen, Paul's a gay fag who likes to lick Yarmulkes and sing Hebrew songs and ties his shoes to the sound of Bahmitzfah music. LOL, we had Matt going for a while... well it was pretty believable. Then Paul missed the 3:50 and I made it... HA! I went home, went out to dinner to Panino's with my famiglia and then practiced drums and went to bed. BORING LIFE.   Dan can be very funny at times...Weerez8702: How to eat David Sunflower Seeds. Crack the shell with your teeth, eat the seed and spit the shell. Experienced seeders pop a handful of seeds in their mouth and store them in one cheek, then transfer a seed over to the other side with their tounge, crack it, then eat the seed and spit out the shell.
