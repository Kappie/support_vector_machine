I also think they know when I'm going to need them to talk to or whatnot because it seems to me that everytime I turn around and it turns out this way, they've been long gone for about a week, and then another week after I don't need them.  If you've ever had this happen to you, then I'm glad. Not that you've had it happen mind you, but that I'm not alone. I'd never want anything to happen to you (Unless you decided to never come back. Then you can die a slow and painful death. Muahahahaha!!!) *Clears Throught* Anyway, I really don't have much to write tonight. I'm halfway trhough with  The Fires of Heaven  Then I start on the 6th book in  The Wheel of Time  series. I still don't have the 8th one, but that's a long ways off. So you hope =-)  So off I go now. Bye. I really should tell you about today though. We were gone shopping the whole day. That's usually what ends up happening when my sis goes to the allergist and gets her shots.And oh well... Blah Blah Blah. I'm tired. Bye. =-P
