Remember that life initially was designed to be with or commune with God.  So by default, life was meant to be good and fulfilling, and because of man now we live a life without God.  I think one can look at this point as just a “particular arrangement of words” but I think it’s important to state that life with God, which was by design, is good, and everything in it was designed to enjoy.  I think that the distinct difference between Cobain, Presley, and Solomon is that in his own writing Solomon didn’t recognize that “all” was vanity until... When?  Not until he backslid.  Which makes me wonder why?    Interesting verse that you bring up too... When you look at the previous couple of verses it speaks of treasure in the sense of earthly “recognition” the way the Pharisees pray.  And then when you look following it talks about not being able to serve both God and “mammon” or money.  If you take into account the other parables about money that Jesus speaks of, you find that he is speaking about placing too much emphasis on money and trying to hoard it all up, save it and protect it... I think by this scripture he’s merely stating the obvious that you can’t take anything from earth with you.    I mean if you just go back to proverbs God states: Riches and honor are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.  My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.  ... “to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.” It seems clear, also seeing that both David and Solomon were the two richest kings in history... Remember too, that inheritance for your children is a large part of the old testament that was not refuted or changed under the new covenant and therefore still holds true.  So, by this we can conclude that Jesus didn’t mean don’t have any money left on earth when you die... Because it is all in vain.  Onto the other note.  I think that you make a valid point, by stating that there are cases where the lines between material “means” and when people actually begin to worship the “means” becomes blurred.  And who’s to say (without further study) that was the case with Solomon.  One thing we have to keep in mind though that prosperity was a good thing, both in the old and new testaments.  And that EVERYTHING in the house of God was the BEST.  You’re talking Gold, Cedar, all hand crafted, only the best... And this wasn’t just in the holy of holies where God dwelt... Even in the outer court yards... The alter for sacrifice, the Priests’ robes... Everything was top notch..and people get offended because they find out the church bought $100,000 worth of camera equipment, or that the new facilities cost $45 million.  Let’s not forget that David’s largest lump sum offering equated to over $145 million dollars... And it didn’t dent his bank account.   I think it’s clear that there is nothing wrong with wanting the “best” the bible says we should be the head and not the tail, the first and not the last, above ONLY and never beneath... I think that to limit that to a “spiritual” or “emotional” context is limiting God.  Also, to say that because it’s easy for us to lose track of our priorities, and that because the potential exists for us to look to money or cars as altars doesn’t justify not having them.  I mean, on that premises you could say the same thing about expensive foods, having children, reading a book, or getting married; we can’t deny that many a Christians have fallen away due to their spouses.  I think even the desire for knowledge or love could be put in the same boat... Where you want so much to know “things” know “answers” that you forget, or lose track of the most important thing... I was listening to Ravi, that cd on worship, and he talks about the void within people..and how love is only a part of filling that void... That the true meaning of our existence... The reason for being, for our creation... Was to worship God.  So we may look for love, or knowledge, or money... I think they’re all in the same boat.. For every person who wants to make three extra dollars, there a fella who wants to know “” this much more... And there’s another guy who just wants to experience a little more love... I think they’re all in the same boat and it would be difficult to say one outweighed any other.   Humbly learning from each debate, MrRee-theous.
