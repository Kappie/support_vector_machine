Just woke up now, my sleeps been all funny recently because of the summer holidays. I've got no reason to go to bed at any specific times at the moment so I seem to be having like this whole6 hours sleep/6 hours of awake going on. I'll be sleeping all day andup till 4 one night and the next I'll be awake all day andin bed at half 6, it's kinda funny really.   My internet does this thing around 12ish all night long where it just disconnects you every 10 seconds, VERY annoying. I think it's to stop people taking advantage of the 'anytime' deal where they could just leave it on all night downloading. It's bad because theres nothing to do at 2 in the morning apart from come online, most of the channels end or either just go onto some crappy shopping thing.   Going out tonight, not sure where too...probably just around town or something. I'm hoping I'll run into someone but I'll see how that   goes.... I need money! I always get hungry when I'm in town and have like a pound or something on me and can never afford a pizza or a kebab or whatever or even just some chips, so I usually go hungry.   I can't stay in town too late because I don't have a car and I've gotta get my parents to pick me up. I would take the shortcut and go down the river but theres no way in hell I'm going down the river by myself in the dark, I'll get raped the shit out of or something. Everytime I seem to walk downtown in the evening someone will want a fight with me for no reason at all or I'll get chased and no one believes me that it happens either and the other day I had to walk home cos everyone went out even though they knew I needed a lift and I got chased all the way down the common. I can't believe people who are 17 are still chasing and starting on people, You would have thought they'd have grown out of the habbit really at around the age of 12 but meh.   My gran is coming round later to pick up some washing because our washing machine is broken, it's good to see them but I owe them some money and I'm supposed to go round and do some jobs but I get uncomfortable when I'm there for a while and I get quite tired. I might go on Sunday with mum but I know they're gonna try and drag me down today, I don't wanna go though..   I better go get breakfast and shower.
