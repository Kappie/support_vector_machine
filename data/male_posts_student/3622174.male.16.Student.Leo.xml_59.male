It's better than hearing about how bored I am, right?  Well, anyway.  Be sure to check out Blog of Bagel later tonight, for the start of my "Family Guy" top 10.  Yeah, I'm going to keep doing these countdowns of my favorite shows for the rest of the week, so get used to it.  But, anywho.  Let's get to it.  Here are my top 5 episodes of Rocko's Modern Life:  5. Leap Frogs In this episode, Mrs. Bighead feels that Ed doesn't want her around anymore, so she invites Rocko over to "have him do stuff for her."  Not sexually, of course, this is Nickelodeon we're talking about.  But, anyway.  When Ed comes home to seeing Rocko in a bath robe, he feels confused because he thinks that Bev is cheating on him...with a Wallaby!  This episode was pure classic, because Nickelodeon doesn't allow good stuff like this to air.    4. To Heck and Back This one introduced the character "Peaches," which is one of the funnier, but rarest characters in the show.  Heffer accidentally swallows a chicken bone and chokes, and goes to Heck.  This episode is funny because of the jokes directed at Heffer at how glutton-ish he is.  I love this one.  3. A Sucker for the Suck-o-Matic A vacuum cleaner that sucks up the whole world?  Sure, I'll go with that.  Rocko's vaccum cleaner goes dead on him while he is trying to clean, so he listens to an infomercial and buys the Suck-o-matic, which is a high powered vacuum cleaner that plans to take over the world.  This episode was pure genius.    2. Jet Scream This episode had Heffer getting on a plane for the first time, and he was scared.  So, after the flight goes unexpected and eventually crashes into the ground head first, everyone evacuates the plane quickly, and decides never to fly again, except Heffer, who goes down the evacuation shoot several times before giving up.  This episode is funny because it resembles the first time I ever went on a plane (the scared part, anyway), and Heffer's experience in First class made him enjoy the whole thing.  Rocko's expression during the flight was horrible, since he got one lousy peanut to eat, so he decides to take the bus to get to their destination.  1. Wacky Delly This episode was PURE genius.  Ralph Bighead decides to cancel The Fatheads (a parody of his parents) after so many seasons.  The network that he produces for is making him come up with a new cartoon.  So, when he goes to his parents house to announce that, he catches Heffer playing with deli meats.  Ralph, who wants out of the cartoon business, decides that the idea is stupid enough to work.  So he hires Heffer, Rocko, and Filburt to do the show for him.  Unfortunately for Ralph, the show is a huge success, and has become a phenomenon.  So, he does whatever possible to sabotage the show, and at the end, it works, and the show gets cancelled, leaving Bighead free to do whatever he wants.  Well, there ya have it, the top 10 episodes of Rocko's Modern Life, the best cartoon I ever saw as a kid.  Now I gotta get going to start my bagel.tech updates for the day, so until later on, adios!
