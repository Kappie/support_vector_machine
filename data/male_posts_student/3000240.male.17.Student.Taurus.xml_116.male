England was really good last night, at the home of football (Stamford bridge of course) with me and Ian making the shed bar's faithful howl in laughter on regular occasions, without my knowledge it must be said (I had downed several large beverages by this point) was grand. It was great to hear them say "FUCK OF TO THE BOG MATE THEY SCORE WHEN YOUR NOT HERE" where upon everyone attuned into raptuous laughter.  Now we play Portugal, with even more booze flowing between me and Ian, at hopefully, a considerably larger volume of noise, even compared to last night.  Speaking of Ian, form what he tells me last night, He and Tracy (his girlfriend no less) and a camp fellow by the name of Jon are going to move into a little apartment in Mitcham somewhere, and Ian wants me to come stay there, to back up the presence of "hetro masculinity" (why can't he open his eyes and just see I'm hardly that stereotype am I?!?!). This has all come about due to Tracy's family are moving to Brighton, and I've wanted to meet her and talk to her about young Ian for quite a while now (as has everyone Ian, if you'd just trust us poor folk). So I'm caught up at a crossroads to see whether I want to grow up overnight (in Mitcham of all places), or to just stay in the tried and trusted Molesey. I just have to mull intensely for the next few days me thinks.  Thomas seems to be getting more and more adorable by the day, and I think I really like this one, so I might play it not as casual with him from now on. I really want it to work,  even  God must know this by now.  There is sweet FA to do for the next half an hour until 2 and a half hours of super duper Keith man philosopher takes us on another adventure of deep thought and provocation, so I guess I'll just read the times until then. Ciao. xBuBzx
