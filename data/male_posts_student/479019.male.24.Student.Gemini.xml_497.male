I had at least 6 shots of tequila and 2 shots of wild turkey 101... in addition to some beer...  The Alkaline Trio show was whatever... that's to the fucking security stopping mosh pit action and tossed people out for it. WTF is up with that. Security should be there to make sure brawls don't happen and people don't get hurt; however, they shouldn't be fucking fascists and take away any sort of action. They were worse than the Galaxy in Santa Ana.   Also Alkaline Trio played almost all new stuff, which many of the fans didn't know. There was a total difference seen in the crowd based on their reactions to old versus new stuff. I mean... when Private Eye hit... people got crazy. The energy went up several notches despite the fucking security guards. They didn't play good shit like Armageddon or Clavicle. One Man Army was good, but the crowd wasn't into them and again security ruined it. We missed the Start and Paris, TX.... oh well.  Man so tired...  ***
