It shows why you should not let three ex-convicts use a hose, bucket, and two brooms in order to clean a Subway station. It can only lead to the worst. They were all wet for god's sake. I tried to pass by politely, but no, one of them had ot spray me in the ass with water. I hate them! After the sexual assault I left to the opposite side of the station and took the train home. I hate the MTA
