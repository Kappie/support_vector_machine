It's such a wonderful movie especially because that main character guy says Rascal like David Parr. David is really cool and he's got a damn sexy run. Anyways after doing that we had to go give Ms. Doyle our money for pizza on Friday (which I just remembered I won't be here and payed three dollars for pizza I won't be eating) so we went to third floor and Kirsten told me that she just got there so I go PERFECT TIMING! Now that was not Ms. Doyle. It was some lady I have never seen in my life so I was quite embarassed. Then we saw a note on her door that she was in the auditorium with swing choir so we went down there. I gave her the money and then we left because we had to hand in our movie money. See on the last day of school we get to go see the third Harry Potter movie. I can't wait!!!!!!! Then we had to go to first hour. I got a hundred percent on my test!!!!! Oh and Mrs. Thompson gave all the band players a slip for the drawing at the end of the week and everyone was pissed. I got more pissed when Chelsey asked if she was going to do the same for the chorus concert and she replied with, "No, I never really was a chorus person." What a fucking bitch. That is so rude! Second hour Mrs. L didn't say one nice word to anyone. She insulted everyone pretty much. I swear if she insulted us one more time I was going to get up and leave. In math we did the same thing we've been doing for the past week. It's fun though because we dont get any homework. In health we watched a video and talked a bit. It was boring but whatever. During lunch nothing really happened. It happened to be one of the most boring recesses of the year. Chorus we got to sing with the seventh graders. I don't mean to brag but we are really good. I love singing so much. It's one of the best things ever! In gym we played softball again. I caught a pop fly and got the runner on second out. Oh yeah! That's the best I have ever done in my life (in softball). Then seventh hour, English, we watched the very end of the Anne Frank movie. It was SO sad. I'm sitting there and I'm like... I'm not going to cry, I'm not going to cry. I didn't cry. Then in Social Studies we watched CNN. I read my book the whole time though because we don't have an article due. It's extra credit. I'll probably do it anyway. After school I had to babysit the Netzle Pretzels! They are fun. Actually they are really well behaved and devoted to their school work. Audrey worked on her report the whole time she was with us. I got thirteen dollars for babysitting. That's an odd number really. When I got home I ate some food. It was pretty good. Then I got on the computer to check my email and talk with my friends. Just so happens that Mr. Flanagan emailed me back... I don't think I told you I emailed him because I still feel awful about giving him the silent treatment. It was so stupid. Anyways he emailed me back and it was like, "I don't have any hard feelings.  To me, you were just a young girl acting like a young girl.  People mature over a year's time, and you're probably growing up a lot.  Keep in touch over the next few years." I showed Kirsten that and she's like OH MR. FLANAGAN AND EMILY KEEPING IN TOUCH! It was hilarious. Then I got off the net and put some of my magazine pictures in a binder because I want to get rid of all my older magazines. Now I'm back on the net typing this. It's pretty fun.
