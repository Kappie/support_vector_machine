The fantastic evening started right from when we picked Evan up he was hypo - which is always good. We got there and Pirates was was sold out. At this point Ingrid and Tiffany ( I love the name Tiffany) turned up. They were seeing Legally Blonde 2 so Even and I saw that with them. It was another exponential comedy - started off not funny but by the end you were in stitches. Anyways Evan had told his parents to pick us up at 11 something but Legally Blonde went for an hour shorter than Pirates so Evan Ingrid Tiff and I chatted in the food court and it was HILARIOUS. All I can say is; badger b-bang kuh-jah and *slaps table* SEX! I think that was the best night I can remember. I made a conscious decision to write this before I read anyone else's blog because I KNOW that this good had to cause someone else something bad...  1up 'shroom: Evan, Tiff and Dingo, some truely great people.  Poison shroom Minis for being too expensive
