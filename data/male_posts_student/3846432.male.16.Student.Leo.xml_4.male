I do have football practice tonight for two hours but that isnt what I really want to be doing with my summer, ever since school has been out and even while it was going on I have been prepping myself for the upcoming football season and I can't wait for it but all I seem to do now a days is be tired and and lift/condition. My grandparents did come visit last week for a couple of days but we didn't do anything out of the ordinary except eat out at ruby tuesday's on thursday but that wasn't anything new.  Although for not feeling like I am doing alot I have done a good deal of work this summer: mowing 3 yards which consume almost 17 hours of my week, working on our newly aquired land about 5 hours a week ( and all I do is clear brush, weed eat the drive path, and cut up trees ), then I spend sunday mornings and eveninings at church which is fun prolly about at the most 4 1/2 hours a week, and then out side of all that I go to lifting/conditioning for football for about 2 hours every evening. But really it's not that bad because I get paid for the work and the lifting pays off in the end but I want more time for the movies and hanging/partying. Finishing thought right now is : I really want to learn to ride a horse and I cant wait till I can be in ROTC!
