I'd go back to sleep right now, but there's no point in even doing that.  Checking my quarter/semester/final grades and first day of work occur tomorrow.  Those are just things that happen.  There's no excitement to it, there's no Bob Costas coming out of the walls to give an interview pertaining to said events.   Being at home three days in a row pisses me off like none other.
