It was right along with Scripture, gives the human/God aspects of Christ, and gives honor and glory to Him. Mel Gibson was SO good with this movie. My favorite actor, I guarantee, will be Jim Caviezel, the man who played Jesus. He was so good. We didn't see him, but instead saw Jesus Christ. He is also a Christian. I quickly started looking up to that man. It is a movie that, if you see it, will renew your senses of God, give new understanding to the suffering and death of my Lord, and revive your Christianity in a new and wonderful way. If you have never seen it, I urge you to see it. Treat it like a church worship service and prepare your heart. God will bless you.   Anyway, I gotta go get ready for driver's ed now... blog ya later! Probably tomorrow. A lot more coming tomorrow.  In Christ, Mike >
