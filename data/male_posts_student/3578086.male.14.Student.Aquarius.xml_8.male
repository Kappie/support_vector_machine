When you are at school(now this is directed at anyone between the ages of 10-18) do you feel like there is the "cool" Group in your school? It has been this way at my school for ages there has always been one boy (who is usually good at sport) that has dominated my school. I wont post any names up here. Well this "cool" guy at our school it seems what he wants every one else in the his "cool group" do the same. Well I don't think he has anything against me but all these people just seem to avoid me like he does. And this hurts me a lot. And before this guy got really cocky i used to be quite good friends and then I found my self like falling in love with him which always happens to me. And now I feel they r avoiding me and because the are "cool" they have an effect on the whole school so everybody apart from my immediate friends avoid me and give me weird looks.  Well so is life Alim
