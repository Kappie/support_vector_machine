The gist of the job is that they proceed into the bathroom ahead of the star to scope out the room and empty it of people, if necessary. Then they guard the room while the entertainer, well, you-know, goes poop 'n' stuff. No word yet on if wiping is part of the job description...  And you thought your job was crappy!
