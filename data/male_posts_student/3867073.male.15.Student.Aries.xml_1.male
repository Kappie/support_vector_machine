It played long and hard even though we weren't playing from the tips, mostly because it was still over 6500 yards and the long par fours were relentless.The only one under 350 was the eighth at 320, and every thing else ranged from 355 to 445 yards. The par fives were relatively shorter, but that was no consolation as I played the four of themat nine over. So now more about me. I shot a 90, which netted me 25th place in a field of 60 posted scores. The greens were super fast down hill and somewhat slow uphill, and that threw me off for 39 putts :(. I probably would have been more confident with their speed if I were used to the greens, but the practice green maybe threw me off more than helped me. I finally had a birdie, the first time in a while. One the eighteenth I had a pretty good drive (a 370 par 4) and a eight iron which with the help of a good kick rolled to two feet below the pin. five pars complemented the round ending birdie, but two doubles, a triple and a four putt quad threw those out (compared to bogey golf). I started both of the nines well, going par-par and par-3putt bogey on 1,2 and 10,11. Five greens in regulation for the day, all of them coming when my drive was in the fairway (or a par three). It was also obvious to me that when I one putted, my score on the hole was lower than average (one under), and three putts hurt the average (worse than double bogey golf). I had an epiphany about dealing with bad drives. If, on a par four, I have a bad drive, lets say a two hundred yard hook into the left trees, If I can advance the ball and put it in the fairway, I can then put it on the green and two putt for bogey, not a bad score for havinga drive in the trees. I used that theory on a couple of holes to scramble and it worked well. The eighteenth hole at winnetka might be a prime canidate for this mindset. To recap, 90, 39 putts, 25th place out of 60, I am okay with the results. A few final thoughts: This was my last tournament of the year, so I had no IJGA tournament rounds under 90 (Al McLean I shot 86). I am having a lesson with Dolph tomorrow before I head out to california to play some golf but more importantly relax at the beach. And the local rules sucked, calling OB a lateral hazard, allowing only two minutes to search for a ball, and calling stones in bunkers movable obstructions. Shame on them!
