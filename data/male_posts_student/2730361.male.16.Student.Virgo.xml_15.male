This of course meant that it took me half and hour to figure out where to put my links and how to get the comments where i wanted them but thats what you have to live with. Dont you just love technology. Well its almost a week till i leave and go to gainesville (sorry if i spelled it wrong)and i dont have to deal with my sisters for two months. But i will, unfortunately, miss band camp. So thats what im doin for the rest of the summer everyone who reads this leave a comment tellin us what your gonna be up to so the whopping 2 or 3 people who read this blog will have something interesting to see.
