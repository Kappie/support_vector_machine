What a load of bullshit, I'm 100% sure it was him. Ok this morning I didn't wake up until 7:30 because there was the pep rally and school didn't start until 8:15 or something, Dan C drove me. In English I got an F on a quiz for accidently calling out. Woops. I had a huge headache today starting at the end of 7th period. Then I started saying "gay" and "fag" alot and Heaton told me to stop saying it concidering the Gay Alliance will beat the shit outa you... I stood up and screamed "COME ON, BRING EM TO ME, BRING ME A WHOLE GAY ARMY, I'LL TAKE THEM ON SINGLE HANDED, HEADSTRONG I'LL TAKE GAYS ON!" I think my head starting hurting because I yelled alot, but I always do that in lunch, maybe it was something I ate. THE SPICEY CHICKEN IS DEADLY. "The spicey chicken is pretty good." - Huge lunch lady that has a extremely low voice. Ryan G always cracks up when I do that impression of her. Nothing else happened in school. Now I'm home, relaxing, reading a bit of Nintendo Power, chatting on the compy, and I have no clue what's going on tonight. My mom and sister just left for a night and morning Brownies trip to sleep at the aquarium...don't ask, I wouldn't be surprised if the tanks broke and they drowned. Ok, that's basically everything, bye.
