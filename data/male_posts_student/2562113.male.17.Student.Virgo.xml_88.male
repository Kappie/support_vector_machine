Bigah... i dont care. xavier scored some major awsome points with driving, gettin the brew, pickin up jesus, the coolest person in the world, and so on. i know there was no point to this blog, but if you think about it, is there ever a point? we are always so bored or so wasted that we actually spend time reading these things ( at least i do :( ) oh well im mad hungry, im going to eat. good bye my friends  stimpith j.
