I was curious to know how far I was walking in a day, how far I went during my physio training, etc.  Just pure curioustity.  In under 2 days, I have made 15 656 steps! :|  This totals to 14.40 km.  Now, if you are saying, that's nothing!  I f*cking hate you!  I have not been physically active what so ever for about a year.  Then, once my knee surgery was completed, I spend 2 weeks at home, sitting on my ass doing absolutely nothing!  Muscle atrophy my friends... my left leg (operated knee) looked... still does... like a 5 year-old's leg.  The right calf looked massive compared to my left.  I mean, I know my legs are not big by anymeans, but still.  Amazing how you can lose muscle mass so immidiately.  Something that I have learned and taken from the knee surgery, other than the information I had studied, is that do not take things for granted.  I have noticed to not take my legs for granted.  Broken Foot = 2 Weeks On Crutches = Hell... ACL Reconstructive Surgery = 2 Weeks At Home = 5 Weeks On Crutches... F*ck was it ever nice to walk again I tell yeah...
