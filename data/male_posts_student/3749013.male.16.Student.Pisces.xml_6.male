I slept at 3am yesterday, typing the previous blog. I slept with a heavy heart, due to the incident yesterday.  I went to school in home clothes today, slacked through the lesson, and left the geog room. Because after my class was her class' lesson, I got the chance to bump into her, WITH HER SPECS ON!!! Apparently, her contact lens were spoilt during our wild wild wet outing. I was mesmerised by her, but only for a while before she enters the geog room. Then, I went to Funan with friend D to buy Logitech cordless mx duo, which is so damn cool. I now actually enjoy typing more than before, as I can now sit further from the screen in order not to spoil my eyes. Then, I went home by bus 61. On the way home, I thought of her today with her specs on, of how pretty she was with her specs on. Suddenly, I had an biological effect on my *ahem*... After I reached home, I immediately set up the cordless mx duo, and enjoy typing. Then, I went to sleep at around 4pm, until 8pm, then slacked in front of my pc until 1.30am, then I left home for cycling with friend T. We cycled to Hougang, trying to find out where she stays, only to realise that we don't know which block she stays. I had messaged her earlier at home, asking if she had slept, but she did not reply, which really disappoints me. After failing to find where she stays, we went to grab some bite, and then rested at a bus stop to chat. I talked about her, and he talked about his girl. Then, he told me that there's still something else that happened at wild wild wet, which may be my 3rd rejection of that day. He told me that she said something else that day during the slide up partner incident. She apparently threatened to walk out on me if we were to partner each other for the slide up ride. Luckily, I did not hear these words that time, or else I would have left wild wild wet right away.  Of course I felt very upset about her words. I would never have thought that all those words had came from her mouth, but since it had happened, I'm glad that I'm not kept in the dark. Now, I feel that she's a little too harsh on those words, but since she dislikes me, why should I continue pursueing her, knowing that I do not even have a single chance? I can't stop thinking of her, I'm afraid that I would break down anytime soon, and flop my 'O' Levels. How can I just forget the past 3 years? I've been thinking of her since I met her. She could be my morale booster for my 'O' levels. But I should try to wake myself up from these dreams, if not I would really flop my O's.  I'm now pretty sad that things have gone to this stage, a stage where I do not even have a chance in pursueing my one love. What have I done to get this treatment from her? Why is GOD against me? Am I destined to be a failure from start? WHY DID GOD ALLOW ME TO LAY MY EYES ON HER???!!!
