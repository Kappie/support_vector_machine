This class has been challenging and beneficial both to the church and to me as I have put the lessons together.  This week we continued our look at the gospels by looking at Mark's Gospel.    This gospel has long held a special place in my heart.  I love Mark's presentation of the life of Jesus.  I chose to focus our discussion last night on the Mystery in Mark.  Who is this man Jesus?  Do YOU believe He is the Messiah?  Will YOU follow Him?  This is what I love about Mark.  His gospel is SO evangelistic...he pointedly writes, asking, "Will you believe?"  And the best part of Mark...no one in the entire gospel gets who Jesus is until the end of the gospel.  Mark's gospel is the only gospel that shows everyone, including the disciples, to be completely oblivious to who Jesus truly is.  The only person to confess Jesus as the Son of God is the Roman Centurion standing at the foot of the cross in chapter 15!  Of course, this does make sense when we remember that Mark is writing to a Roman Gentile audience.  By having the centurion be the only one to confess Jesus, Mark is making a strong connection to his audience.  It is as if he is saying...see, this guy gets it, do you?  I think the reason I love this gospel so much is because it puts the modern Chrisitan in the right place.  It helps us remember that the ones who "get it" in our time may not be the leaders in our local Baptist, Methodist, or Church of Christ churches.  The ones who "get it" may be the local prostitutes (who may know, very personally, more leaders than we will ever know); or, maybe it is the men down at the local gay bar; or, maybe it is the homeless person standing on the corner selling today's paper.  I hope that we can all read Mark's gospel and allow ourselves to forget the ending.  Read it without thinking...I know who this Jesus is.  Instead, read it like Mark writes it...full of questions.  If we read Mark this way, the final chapters are blow-you-away powerful, and I believe they will cause us all to question if we truly believe in this man, Jesus.  God bless.
