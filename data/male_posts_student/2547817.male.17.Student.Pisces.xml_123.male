You try to run from it, but the more you run, the deeper, more terrible it grows behind you, its edges yawning at your heels. Your only chance is to turn around and face it, but it's like looking down into the grave of your love. Or kissing the mouth of a gun, a bullet trembling inside it's dark nest, ready to blow your head off.  I opened my eves and everything slid into focus. I was hurt, my crime, was like a hungry pit behind me. I had to run, get as far away from it as possible. It was past the point of no return. The fatal choice already made, and it would get worse before the end. The past is a puzzle, like a broken mirror. As you piece it together, you cut yourself. Your image keeps shifting and you change with it. It could destroy you or drive you mad. It could set you free.  You'll see the choices you didn't know you'd make, like staying at work late to chat with a friend instead of hurrying home to your family. Kissing her, I think of the cold laws of cause and effect. I am afraid, but I start again from the beginning, trace my steps to the scene of the crime. I had to be punished for what I had done. "Like brother's caught on opposite sides of a civil war".  Something in the night felt like a door had been opened. An echo of the past, an old monster snapping it's eyes open in the depths of my brain. Closing your eyes forces you to look at the darkness inside. I hadn't slept in a long time. When I did, my dreams were nightmares. In a nightmare, every choice you make is a wrong one. I would wake up at night afraid that day was a dream I'd forget.  When you're waking up, the world is a blur. What was clear in a dream suddenly makes no sense. No surreal rescues, no magic way out, but you ARE awake. Fraternising with the enemy, I had stepped over the edge. The cartoon moment waits for the coyote to realize his mistake before taking the plunge.  The things that I want- by Tim W. A whiskey, a smoke, for the sun to shine. I want to forget, to change the past, my baby back, unlimited ammo and a license to kill, but right now, more than anything I want her.  To kill those who were trying to kill me, the bullet, real or imagined, lodged in my head, routing my synapses. Driving me on. But surely, as the bullet rips through the victims flesh, organ and bone, it shatters the image of the man who pulls the trigger. This is what I see when I look back. The moments, blinding as snow, they kill you, change you. You die and live again. Remade.  The genius of the hole. No matter how long you spend climbing out, you can still fall back down in an instant. You come to, amidst the wreckage of your own making. You stay there, eyes squeezed shut, afraid to move, hoping you'll bleed to death. Or do you crawl out, help you loved ones, make sure the fire doesn't spread, try to fix it?  All this time, we got the fable of sleeping beauty wrong. The prince didn't kiss her to wake her up. No one who's slept for a hundred years is likely to wake up. It was the other way. He kisses her to wake himself up from the nightmare that's brought him there.  There are things in life you cannot choose. How you feel... I had lain at the bottom of the pit long enough. Too long. The only true reason why men fight wars is love. Death is inevitable. Our fear makes us play it safe, blocks out emotion. It's a losing game. Without passion, you're already dead. It's all a matter of perspective, tied to time and space. Love and friendship, life and death. Everything is subjective, choices, answers, good and evil.  Einstein was right. Time is relative to the observer. When you're looking at the tip of a blade, time slows down, your whole life flashes by, heart break and scars. She was beautiful. I hated her for making me feel this way. I didn't deserve to walk away. There are no happy endings. The illusion comes afterwards when you ask, "why me" and "what if". When you look back, you see the branches like a pruned bonsai tree or forked lightning. If you had done something differently it wouldn't be you. It would be someone else looking back asking a different set of questions.  The past is a gaping hole. Your only chance is to turn and face it, but it's like kissing the lips of your dead love. Darkness waiting in the hole of her mouth. We are willing to suffer, to die for the things we care about. For love, for the right choices. Because of her, I had solved my case. All of it, who I am. It's almost morning. Waking up from my dream. She has brought me here. To this moment of clarity, where time slows down and I choose to look back, to see myself.  And in that moment of clarity, in that act of seeing, I am reborn. I had a dream of her. She was gone, but it was all right.
