Its best to have your screen resolution set at the highest, because you need to be able to see a lot of web page and it isn't scroleable. I dont' know if you understood what that last part ment but I think you will if you check out the site. Don't go if you haven't seen the movie.  Well again, goodbye.  -Dan V
