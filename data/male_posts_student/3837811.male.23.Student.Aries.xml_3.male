On off today, so there's no lunch at home, had to da-bao.. By the time i wasgoing out, i was feeling really hungry, so i rushed out, put on my  slippers  and rushed down the stairs.. And the front part of the left sole came out!!              OMG, if this happened at the kopi-tiam, i might as well come home bare-footed..           Heng sia, it came out at the stairs near myflat andnot at the kopi-tiam, i cant imagine what will i do if it came out at the kopi- tiam.. lol.. Oh well, one lesson learnt, change ur slippers if its in danger of splitting!      Current Mood: Wise      Current Music: Andy Hui  Evonne Xu - Lian Ai Pin Lu
