Can't wait to have a little chat with him about it.  A few minutes ago, I decided to go downstairs and spend a little quality time with my family. I figure I'll watch a little TV and make them think I actually like them. I only made it 2 minutes. They were watching the bloody new show Whoopi, which happens to be  insanely  racist. In the few minutes I saw, they insulted just about every race (except black people, of course, because they don't allow THAT on TV. I get so pissed off about this crap. Don't even get me started on Oxygen or Women's Entertainment. I can't wait until there is a WMET: White Men's Entertainment Television. I will die a happy man.
