I took Jamin back to his Grandma's in Middleport, and then came to New Haven.     I took four pills at once, it was good. I feel alot better right now, it's about time. I've been taking those damn antibiotics for about 3 months.    I'm really happy right now, although you probably can't tell. Anyway...    After New Haven, I took my darling to the fair for her band concert. She did exceptional. She's so cute, I love her so much. We walked around the fair for a few minutes, then went back to her house.     She's incredible. I'm telling you, I'm in love with her so bad it's not funny.   It's 2:30 AM and all I want to do right now is hold her. She's my baby.     Oh, and I'm actually watching TV for once. I just don't watch it  all  the time, like some people. :) I don't feel like watching Futurama. I feel like watching you.     Hmm... now what to say. I'm really bored. Brice is snoring beside me. Argh.     I might as well go to sleep, there's nothing better to do. I've thought about you since I left you, I should probably stop. Don't get me wrong, I'll dream about you.     Today's  Songs  to Illegally Steal from Kazaa: "Poor Places" by Wilco and "Wildflowers" by Ryan Adams.     Poor Places for the fact that it has the most kick-ass guitar part in history, right after Tweedy sings "I'm not going outside". Yeah, just ask Jamin; he knows.     Wildflowers is beautiful. Ryan Adams, once again, breaks me.     "Cause tonight she's sleeping alone... without him."     It makes me think of you, and how I long for the day that I don't have to leave.  I can't wait.  I'm so in love with you, Jami.      Keep cool my babies, I'm out.
