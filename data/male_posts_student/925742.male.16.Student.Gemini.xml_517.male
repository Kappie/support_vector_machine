At least Heather, the HOT NEW MANAGER was there.  She looks like a blonde Tina Fey with bigger tits and my God, HOT.  She was there today, as well.  I mowed with Rod both days.  She's gonna be with us every Friday.  Awesome, because she will lie for us to Gary.  Muahaha.  I'm prolly gonna get myself a dvd and a cd and extra money sometime soon as a belated gift.   While I wasw mowing, I saw the biggest butterfly I have ever seen, and in itself, it represented the beaty of nature, pacified.  It was as large as my hand and more colorful than a kaleidoscope.  Delicate and yet, great in size.  I have never seen such a thing in my life and probably never wil again.  It is sad to think when you want to take a picture, to remember the image, you can't....
