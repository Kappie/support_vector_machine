Sometimes when I'm talking to people, I say things that I instantly regret and think, 'wow, what a stupid/inappropriate/unneeded thing I just said.' But then later I feel better.  I doodled some things today, and I like them. I need to draw more often, cuz I love it.  I really did intend this to be longer...
