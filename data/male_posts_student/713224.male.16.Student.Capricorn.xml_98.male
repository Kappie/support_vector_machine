The main thing that pushed me over the edge to make a decision was the wealth of fans There is a 2 week free trial where all you have to do is cancel within a 2 week period, and so i decided to take it. I haven't gotten any DVDs yet, because I onlny signed up today, but the first ones on my queue ship on Monday. After about an hour of browsing and getting used to the system, I had 200 DVDs on my queue. I decided to narrow it down, because there is NO WAY i could watch all though movies, so i narrowed it down to 100, which I won't be able to see in the 2 week span, but i'll try and get close.      The browsing works just fine and the adding of the movies works very well, for the most part the recomendations are great, and how I found most of the movies, but some times stray from the catagory, like figure skating olympic finals is produced when i look for recomdendations for a skate video i just added to my queue.  Stay tuned for the next 3 parts of my netflix adventure.
