I am extremely sorry for not blogging for the past 3 weeks.To use cliches,this was due to-   a)I had no  urlLink time .  b)My  urlLink computer  was experiencing some never heard of errors which rendered it impossible for me  to do anything with it. (Exun members note-The IP address mysteriously vanished from  urlLink Network  Connections and repeated attempts to enter a new one completely failed.End result-I had to change form Sify to Hathaway) Since summer  urlLink holidays  are here(finally),I will now find enough  urlLink time  to blog properly.  But first,something which is eagerly awaited(sarcastic laughter),an account of the past days.    April 28,29  Days where I took some much needed  urlLink time  off from  urlLink school  to prepare for the SAT.How I wasted them is another story.    April 30    Day where to my surprise and amazement,we finally got to go to a GSP.The bad  urlLink news  was that we missed the funnest periods,Chem practicals with Da Owl.Also had an appointment with Mamta "Teapot" Sharma,who flatly refused to "counsel" me unless I paid up Rs.200.Another instance of the school's highly devious money-making ways.    May 1    Day I turned sweet sixteen,the busiest birthday of my life. Here's a look at my day- 7.30 a.m- Started from my Noida  urlLink home  for the SAT  urlLink test  venue,USEFI. 9.00-12.30a.m- SAT exam.Went of very well,unlike most others.Left me expecting a perfect score. 1.20 p.m- Reached Fiitjee headquarters in Sarvpriya Vihar. 1.30-5.30 pm- Managed to endure 4 hours of classes.     May 2    Highly exhausted after another 8 hours of Fiitjee,I went into a deep sleep between 6.OO p.m in the evening to 8.00 a.m in the morning.    May 3,4  School  urlLink holidays .Completed mounds of past schoolwork,studied for Monday  urlLink Test  and to my disbelief,managed to solve a lot of Fiitjee questions.    May 5   Day of the third phase of elections,with most exit polls suggesting a hung Parliament. After Monday  urlLink Test ,went to meet Siddhartha Basu to pesent him with a copy of the quizbook manuscript and bully him into  urlLink writing  a preface. Accompanied by one of the zillion Headmistresses of Da Factory,Deepa Raghavan,who incidently hails from the land of Laloo.She and Abhinav got along famously,discovering a lot of mutual  urlLink friends  and relatives.We landed up at his  urlLink office  in East Of Kailash,one of the worst residential places on this planet,only to discover that he was busy in a busyness meeting(misspelling intentional).Spent some  urlLink time  chatting with his wife, Anita Kaul Basu,who happens to be my mother's collegemate from her Miranda  urlLink House  days. Anyway ,he did manage to emerge from his meeting and was quite impressed with the quizbook.He showed us his quizzing  urlLink software  ,which he wanted to sell to  urlLink schools .Quite cool.What was cooler was that his team made questions in the same way as I had done,facing the same  urlLink time  to  urlLink time  problems that I faced with their lingo and structure.So now there is another alternate  urlLink career  just tailormade for me,in case I ever want to take it up.  Ran into another friend of my mother's,Rupin Dang,her classmate at Airforce  urlLink school  and son of the Principal.Also into our quizmasters of the CBSE quiz-Aditya Mubai(a cousin of my favourite teacher from Somerville ,Anita Raina) and Kunal Savarkar. This is indeed a small world.    May 6    Day Da Penguin became berserk,asking us to write both a matrimonial and obituary for her.Was she thinking about dowry deaths?????     May 7     Another day of berserk teachers.At the stroke of Twelve,Da Sardar first gave us a horrible mnemonic-BB ROY Of Great Britain has Very Good Wife,then tells us that it is not right ,as he has yet to meet a wife that is good. He then finished a 2-litre  urlLink water  bottle,and then had the temerity to say-  "Beta,itni choti bottles se mere jaise sardar ka kuch nahin hone wala"  He also managed to convert his  urlLink single  35 minute period with us into hold your breaths,115 minutes of 3 consecutive periods.  This was also where we discovered some new names for Odoyo Ki Maa.While some of them were Black  urlLink Beauty ,O/O form and The  urlLink Horse  Whisperer,the one which we found most apt was, of course,  PATALMATA  .This is due to her completely unique combination of orange  urlLink hair  on black body.Accompanied with her hanging biceps from Babylon,she presents a frightening picture ,reminding one of the rakshasinis of mythology.  Savadhaaan!!Patalmata padhaar rahin hainnnnn!!  Also overheard -Sumanlata discussing her  urlLink holiday  plans for Goa with Vandana Marwah. We already know that she is a national level  urlLink basketball  player,just visualise her playing beach volleyball.    May 8,9    Another Fiitjee weekend.Need I say more?    May 10    Fourth and final phase of polling.Most exit polls predicting that NDA was inching towards halfway mark.
