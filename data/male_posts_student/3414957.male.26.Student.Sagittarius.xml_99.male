I have lots of new poetry but I don't want to rush putting them on my website so they will wait until tomorrow. I think I can work it in my schedule if I am not too busy at my work. Now I am just surfing the web, thinking about nice things. I want to get rid of this monkey on my damn back. My idea was to just "get away" but that will never work. Where would I go? There are people everywhere. I need to make a new front. The neutral front that I show to the everyday common folk. That way, I will blend into the background of everyday life. That is exactly where I want to be, just observing. That is also what Lao Tzu teaches in the Taoteching. Smart, very smart.
