I spent some quality time on the market the other day so today I'm ready to dispense this recipe upon the world that is commonly known in Italy as "pasta con broccoli e panna", pasta with broccoli and cream. You need one Teflon-pan (the big ones) and a large pot for the broccoli and the pasta. Fill the pan with water and bring it to the boiling point. Add a bit salt and throw the broccoli washed and chopped off the thick parts. This is the critical part, I'm not sure about timing but you should check it out every now and then to see if it's soft enough, don't take it out too soon because it might be hard to make the sauce if its too hard. My estimate is it has to be at least 20 minutes but I didn't time it. Once taken out put new water to boil for the pasta. In the meantime you should be making the sauce. At first put some olive oil, and chop some onion in it and leave it on fire until it gets some color, you can add some garlic that you can later take out. Once the broccoli are done add them to the pan with the cream, add some white and black pepper. If you think it's hygienic put some of the water in which the broccoli was boiling (the bit rich with broccoli peaces and color) inside the pan, it'll buy you some time until the pasta is done. Once the pasta water gets boiling, put salt as desired and put the pasta in. Once the pasta is to your taste, pour it out, and either put the pasta in the pan or vice-versa. Stir a bit and serve. Don't forget to make a salad as well, it's healthy and your body will be grateful.
