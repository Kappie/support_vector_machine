Plots have begun already, as in, first lesson, and mostly involved Bishop making himself look stupid by suggesting nothing that is physically possible.  On the good side, I did reasonably well at badminton, and beat my way through the group stages of the doubles tourney, despite splintering one of ma toenails, and its double PE at the leisure centre tomorrow! What a skive...mwahahaha. I...mean...won't that be 2 hours of reasonably hard work which will be challenging and intelectually stimulating. Or maybe not. Oh, and I have my 'Post 16 options interview' tomorrow. I mean 'Miss 10 mins of English discussing some random load of nothing in particular with my History teacher'. So...a nice relaxing day of nothingness. What a nice change. Ahhhhhhhhhh.
