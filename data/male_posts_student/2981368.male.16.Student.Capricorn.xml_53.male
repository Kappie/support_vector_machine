Thats 2 - 0 in the playoff series   We'll see wot happens in New jersey   But if boths sides win their home games then Philly will win in the 7th game   game 1  -  Philly   game 2  - Philly   game 3  - New jersey   game 4  - New jersey   game 5  - Philly  game 6  - New Jersey  game 7  - Philly   Thus making a score of 4 - 3 philly   But thats unlikely to happen
