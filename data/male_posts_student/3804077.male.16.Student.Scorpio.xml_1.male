"The Last Samurai" and "50 First Dates". Don't wonder if they were good or anything, BECAUSE THEY WERE! >_> Erm.. Yeah... But they were great man... If you ver happen to watch "50 First Dates" imagine me being Adam Sandler. When he falls in love, not lie to tourists though. >_> If this thing doesn't put dates on them, then I'm going to have to... By the way, this is my first blog thing. Thought it would be cool to check out. Ya know, you could use a blog to write stories about something, I just realised it! Your own fanfic or something you created, and instead of posting it on some other site, you could blog it. And all your friends can read about it without having to go through a bunch of crap... or something... >_> But ya, later.
