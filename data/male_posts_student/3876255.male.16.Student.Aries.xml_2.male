I go to a school where just about 78% or more of the kids smoke, I live in a location near a paper mill, and I stay cooped up in my room all day.  Lots of bad particles enter my nasal cavities, and I have to get that stuff out one way or another.  It's just my choice to stick my finger up in there and dig it all out.  Don't get the wrong idea, though.  I'm not a public picker.  I just do it in the privacy of my own home, and other places where I (hopefully) can't be seen.  Sadly though, the life of a nose-picker can be a harsh one.  When I was in first grade, I was ignorant and I was stupid.  I didn't know about so-called "tissues."  All I knew that day was that I had something in my nose, and my fingers were small enough to fit up there.  The class was lining up to go home for the day.  I was breathing normally, until I felt the pesky little nuisance clinging to the inside of my nostril.  I didn't know that picking was wrong because I was home-schooled in Kindergarten, and I hadn't yet faced the dilemma of how to react to a booger in a room filled with twenty children.  Because of this, I just reached up and * cringe * picked my nose.  Along comes teacher.  " What are you doing, Matthew?  Get a tissue right now! " screamed Teacher.  I thought to myself, "What is this?  I'm being scolded for taking care of my bodily needs?  How passe!"  But I am generally obedient, so I reached into my backpack and retrieved my pocket-sized packet of Kleenexes.  I took one out of the pack, opened it up, placed it around the top of my finger, and stuck my finger back up my nose in an effort once again to remove the dried nasal mucus.  Apparently, Teacher was still not satisfied.  Was it my fault I couldn't properly operate a tissue?  I think not.  " Matthew, if you don't stop picking your nose, I am going to send you to the Office! " exclaimed the angry female staring harshly at me from what seemed like miles above my head.  I had no idea as to what I should do.  I was in a room packed with vicious pre-teens ready to rip me apart for any non-cool thing I did, I was being yelled at by an adult who controlled my grades, and I was being assaulted internally by a wad of mucus unwilling to cease its tickling of my nose.  I decided to just forget trying to pick my nose in favor of getting on the bus and going home.  Later that night, I consulted my mother as to the proper use of a tissue and I learned the wonderful technique of nose-blowing.  The psychiatrist bills mount ever-higher.
