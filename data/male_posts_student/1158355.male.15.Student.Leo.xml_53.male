At least we'll get a longer vacation in a couple of weeks. Nothing really happened today except my computer was acting all bitchy. I did homework, read some greek mythology with a labyrinth and a dude flies and his wings melt and he falls into the ocean, watched Men In Tights, played drums, talked online, listened to music, ate ice cream in a waffle bowl and then fell asleep... well I'm doing that now. Good Night. Oh yes, people remind me tomorrow to use my Linkin Park cd to check out the web site maker. Thanks and Good Night.
