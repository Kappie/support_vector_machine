Mr. Thompson remarked that it was "excellent" so I'm hoping for a nice grade. I even managed to shove in some humour. Go me.  As if it wasn't guessable I've been thinking about someone a lot today... for minor suspense (minor being the key word (oh so intentional pun), as I think this is work-outable) I'm not saying who in such words but I'm just going to say I'm thinking about them a lot and leave it at that. That.  Actually, while I think about it, I haven't been in the computer room at all recently. Heyhey, hello computer room.  If you don't mind, I'll repost later... if you do mind, then I'll still repost later, albeit against your will.  Quote of the day: "I'll pretend that I'm kissing The lips I am missing, And hope that my dreams will come true. And then while I'm away, I'll write home every day, And I'll send all my loving to you."  From The Beatles'   All My Loving   Love, Jon Roskilly
