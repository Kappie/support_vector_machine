Yes, we will gather and play until twilight.  Until it is high moon (clever isn't it?) we will grace the pitch in the pitch black.  It actually starts around 9, but it will end at midnight.  I will write about it most likely tomorrow.  Today's practice was anything but epic.  Four of us showed up.  We played the crossbar game for about a half hour and played cheap baseball for the rest of the time.  My mum I got a lot of stuff done for Italy today.  I got super sexy shirts that will have the Italian ladies on me like white on rice.  We also got cameras and an Italian dictionary and other stuff like that.  Tomorrow is Italy Eve.  Man, I am just so excited.  I can't think right now.  The Chicago Fire return to the place where the dream season ended in a nightmare.  They go back to the Home Depot Center to face the Los Angeles Galaxy live on ESPN 2 at 15:00.  That's 3:00 PM if you don't speak European.  Last year at the Home Depot Center, the Fire lost to the San Jose Earthquakes 4-2 in MLS Cup 2003.  Let's hope the Fire can overcome this field of nightmares.
