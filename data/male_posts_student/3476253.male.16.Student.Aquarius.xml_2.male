I think I spent way too much time playing video games last night (till like 3am), but I don't really regret it.  I'd rather run when I feel like it (which would be after I was fully awake).  Anyways, something really really sucks.  My parents told me today (2 days before my summer vacation officially starts) that they signed me up for community service.  While it isn't anything too hard (all I have to do is mess with some schools computers), not only am I using up my time and not getting paid (I know I know, that's what community service is), but I had no choice in this matter.  My parents are tired of me sitting around on the computer or xbox, doing nothing but sit there.  Even though that's something I love to do, and it should be what summer is all about, they're forcing me to do it.  They got inspired by my brothers Senior award ceremony, where a lot of scholarships were given out to people for community service.  My dad said "If you want to go to college, you have to do this".  I'm not happy about it, and I hate it when people make me do things without even asking me if I want to do them...but I guess I have to live with it.
