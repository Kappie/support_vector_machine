Dr K:ARRRGGGHHHH STAMPHER... STOP YELLING IN MY EAR JA?  Dr K: I am to torture you if you dont do it [open the car] Bond: Do you have a doctorate in that too? Dr K:Ach nein, zis ist more of a hobby.........but im very gifted.  anyhoooo  I cant believe I left MR POXON off the list of legends   yey i got through a blog post without mentioning the 2 exams i did today and how my hand hurts cos of them.   Peace Out !
