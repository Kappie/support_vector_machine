Well this book isn't very big or thick and is about all of the stupid laws that people had come up with since like a long time ago and then just forgotten about just like I did with the book.   So from now on I am going to have a new post each day ( if I remember) about a few really stupid laws of the world.  just to give you a taste here are a few that I thought were particularly funny (btw don't bother asking me where a lot of these places are because i don't know): 1. in california ownership of a gerbil, hamster or ferret is illegal!!??   2. in colorado it is unlawful to throw shoes at the bride and groom at a marriage ceremony.   3. in australia it is law for taxicabs to carry a bale of hay in the boot.  4. the penalty for masturbation in indonesia is DECAPITATION!!!!   well there you have it jst a taste of some wierd and cooky things that people have conjured up to suit there needs in their particuliar time. who knows someday the thought of giving birth naturall could be illegal in the future!!?!?!?
