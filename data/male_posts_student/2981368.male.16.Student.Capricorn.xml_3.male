At lunch, Tim punched me in the nose trying to get that damned balloon *arrrgh*. And asshole of the century Bishop not only stabbed me repeatedly with a compass in History, but elbowed me in the face in hockey.  But somehow...it was a good day! I got loads of chocolate off some person who I don't really know, had lots of supply teachers, and managed to recruit a grand total of 0 people for badminton. Lazy old... *grumble grumble*  More when I can be bothered to type it.
