At least i thought of something exciting to tell you all...  *~_-N E W S  F L A S H-_~*  Today it emerged that Lou's bottle of coke had been kidnapped and is being held to ransom at an unknown location, by a terrorist organisation who call themselves LoZ. It is not yet clear how much the group are demanding for the bottles release, but estimates place the number at about 5 and a half pence. Police have found few clues as to the whereabouts of the bottle but say they are hopeful of recovering it.  Below is the letter sent to Lou, demanding the ransom:   Dear Lou,   We are a terrorist organisation. We have captured your bottle of coke, and if you don't pay us at least enough to get a chomp bar from the corner shop, I'm afraid that we will have to burn your bottle of coke alive. You have 48 hours in within which you must comply with our demands, or suffer the consequences.  Sincerely, A. Terrorist   Prime Minister Blair, who by the way had a firework thrown at him today, has sent her a message expressing his most heartfelt sympathy for the bottle and her.    In other news...  My teacher at school has confessed to reading this blog. I wonder if those mis-spelt comments were from him? He now knows some of my thoughts on life, and I'm not sure if that's a good, or a bad thing :lol: I guess it depends on the thoughts...  While we're on the subject of school, we had another maths test today... not sure how well I did, but I think it was >80% =]  I'm going kayaking tonight! Yay!  I've also discovered that a house that I deliver papers to, has two numbers... And I thought that delivering papers was easy!  I'm off now, got some stuff to do...
