Usually I'm in a rush so I don't bother, but today I decided I might make some scrumalicious Belgian waffles.  What's that you say? They won't fit in the toaster? Yes. That's right. THEY DON'T FIT IN THE TOASTER. Belgian waffles are the square ones that are really thick and puffy, but this company decided to make them  extra  thick and fluffy. Thicker than the slots in my toaster. So I ended up having just a regular apple for breakfast. I might pass out today, but at least I can sue when I slam my head on a desk or something.
