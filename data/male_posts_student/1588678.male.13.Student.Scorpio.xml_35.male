I know you all are pondering what kinda gifts I got so I’ll tell ya:  The New Scarface Box Set,  The Best Of Jimi Hendrix CD, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City for PC, Guitar magnets, Framed record covers of The Clash’s London Calling, The Beatle’s Abbey Road, Jimi Hendrix Experiences’ Smash Hits, and Cheap Thrills’ Big Brothers  The Holding Company, A new CD player, A clock radio, 2004 Guinness Book of World Records, A Homer Simpson Desk Lamp, and A pool table (only about 3 feet long and 2 feet wide).  Oh yeah, you know everyone gets clothing for Christmas, I got a jacket. It’s nice, cuz its not bulky like the jacket of a shoplifter. This Christmas, I got the best presents than any other Christmas. The only downfall to this Christmas is that I can’t run Vice City on my computer cuz my computer is kinda screwed-up. I’m so bummed. Everything thing went great and I hope it did for you.   Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!
