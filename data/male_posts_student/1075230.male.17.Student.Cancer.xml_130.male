We were on a narrow mountain path - not steep - and some guy raced past me saying something like "I now beat you in everything!" (something similar to that). I found that it was someone from my first school - st.john fisher - named michael mele. Anyways, we kinda raced to the bus, and found that it was at the bottom - while we were still high on the mountain path. There was a mountainside on the opposite side, so it was like "\_/" where the bus was at the bottom, and we were at the top left hand side. He slid down, but when he go to the bottom, he tripped and fell. I think i was like grinning, and he said something similar to "why don't you try and come down?" I wanted to, but for some reason i didn't. A bunch of people were sliding down the hill, and one of them - perhaps sliding too fast (on the left side) - went up the opposite side (the right side), and then went thru the air back to the original side (left side) and slid back down. So it was like a loop-de-loop. Which is weird and impossible in real life. There may have been more, but that's all i remember. Exeunt Emerson.   So.. it was an interesting dream which i didn't really find any meaning to, but never-the-less an interesting dream.   ~Chronos
