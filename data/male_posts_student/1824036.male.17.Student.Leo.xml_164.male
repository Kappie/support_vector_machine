Phooey; there es one thing that every hippie wanna-be fears: THE DREADED SHEARS OF A BARBER!  Actually it wasn't that bad. I usually go to  The Regal Barber Shop  on main street, but I decided that they cant cut hair worth a crap. So I decided to venture up the main street hill to Dakota City and try out  Roffler Family Hair Center . That is a hair cut.  I think the difference between the two is  Regal  cuts your hair more or less with pretty much simplicity. Straight edges all the way around. It kinda makes you look like  urlLink Captain Spock .  However, At  Rofflers  they actually "texturized" my hair. And the guy that cut my hair actually told me what he was doing to it. Showed me all this neato stuff that he could do and all this other jazz. I felt more like he knew what the "F" he was doing.  I think that I wil be going to  Roffler Family Hair Center  more often in the future
