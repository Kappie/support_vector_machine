Gorged myself on brownies last night while watching "the Scarlet Empress" starring Marlene Dietrich, than curled up with a book and a pot of chamomile tea. Still was too jeezled to sleep until well after midnight, have got to get back to earlier hours. All sorts of pleasant ideas about gardening are filtering through my head, have to get my landlady to let me have some ground. still no cigarette, quite an accomplishment, if I do say so myself. Three days now. Pretty good for me, usually I break after two. Think I might have a glimmer of a soul left, I just have to cultivate it assiduously.
