"A close encounter of the second kind is an observation of physical evidence of extra-terrestrial visitation. Footprints, heat or radiation damage to terrain and Crop circles, though controversial, are all examples of close encounters of the second kind." (copied from some website)  the book itself is a kind of autobiography of a math professor, who also has a  preference for writing (fiction that is). Since he mixes the two, I am never sure, what is fact and what is fiction, especially when it turns out that the part I thought was fact is actually fiction but then again pretty much fact because he only changed some small details to make it fiction....  nevertheless what do i get out of it: Mathematicians can write nice, easily readable books, so why shouldn't economists be able to do so.... And second, never be an arrogant snob with regard to your academic position, it could prevent you from having sherry with Lord Rothschild (at least I hope that this part was fact not fiction..)
