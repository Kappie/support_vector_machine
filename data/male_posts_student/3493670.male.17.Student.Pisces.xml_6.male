I am sorry that you felt the need to apologize to him after bashing and slandering him on the net for everyone to see.      But I am not sorry for hating you. Hating you with a passion that yes, if I do see you, I will hit you with a fucking sledge hammer with such delight that I will make Clint Eastwood look like a girl scout reject. I am not sorry that I am writing this letter. I am this mad for what happened to my boyfriend and I believe no amount of apology from you can make him forgive you. Suffice to say, you sealed your own coffin. You once had my sympathy, now, you have nothing but my hatred.
