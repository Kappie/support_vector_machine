As much as I'd love to stuff both Tim Robbins and Sean Penn in a deep dark hole, I usually enjoy their films.  They continue with their strings of fine work with this one.  Mystic River was directed by Clint Eastwood, who continues to demonstrate his outstanding ability to craft films.  What struck me about this one was the pacing - the story can get quite convoluted, and at 2 hours and 15 minutes, it's pretty long.  But all of the details, and all the development never escaped me.  I never once had to stop and think "who is this guy again?  What was his name?"  It flowed along like a great novel, and when the tragic inevitability began to loom in the distance, I could see it while still hoping it could be avoided.    Like House of Sand and Fog, the characters in this story are all flawed, and essentially aren't bad human beings.  An argument can be made about Sean Penn, but I still found him sympathetic - a man living by a rough code, doing what he sees as right.  Everyone has a big jagged piece of glass in their soul here, and the pain propels them along in ever tightening circles, leading to mistakes that can't be undone.  The only weakness is in the Kevin Bacon character...not in Bacon's performance, but in the way the story manufactures his own little subset of pain that really has little to do with the story.  Maybe some of the meat had been cut from the film, but as it stands his issue should have been completely removed.  I would recommend Mystic River with the same enthusiasm that I recommended House of Sand and Fog.  Films like this work to return my optimism about cinema.
