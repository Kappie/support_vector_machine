Though the book's title sounds like a Self-help Personality development book , the Book is about GE in the 80's  90's and how it transformed itself from a Colossus to a nimble warrior.Here are the six golden rules of Jack Welch for doing business :   1. Control your destiny, or someone else will.   2. Face reality as it is, not as it was or as you wish it to be.   3. Be candid with everyone.   4. Don't manage, lead.   5.
