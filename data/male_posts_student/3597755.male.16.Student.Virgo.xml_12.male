Let me give you some examples:  Spiderman (1): I am not trying to say that kids believe spiderman is real. (although in Turkey some kids thought they could survive jumping off a building and win over gravity just like Ash Catchem from the Japanese cartoon PoKeMoN.) But what does annoy me is the love scenes in the movie. Short summary: Peter Parker gets bitten by a radio active spider, without further explanation he gets spider ability's and he takes spiderman as his alter ego. Peter Parker has a crush on a girl called Mary Jane. She plays the role of stupid whore who happens to be the crush of the superhero and who happens to get caught by the evil guy. Spiderman saves the day. Ofcourse he almost lost. And ofcourse MJ almost died as well but everything ends well. What is wrong here? a) good always wins. Bullshit. b) Near the end of the movie MJ confesses her love to Parker. Does love always get answered? NO! I wouldn't be surprised if kids would get the impression that love always gets answered and that when the opposite happens in their lives they can't handle it. If you want real, pure, perfect love that's answered the same way you might want to kill yourself in the hope that you can experience it where you come afterwards. It is very rare on this planet. c) How the hell are parents supposed to explain their kids afterwards that mary jane is bad. That they shouldn't try it...?  Same counts for movies like pirates of the carribean, star wars 6 and top gun. I'm not saying you're not allowed to like these movies. (well, except top gun. If you like that movie, you might want to consider checking in into a mental institutions) I'm just saying that these movies, these kind of movies are far from real (yeah, guess you're all pretty surprised that 'pirates' and 'star wars' weren't real). In your movies, you always let me die...
