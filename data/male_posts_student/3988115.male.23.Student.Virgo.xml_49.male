I respond sarcastically about liking being the go-to guy for school info, and she acts like she doesn't know what I'm talking about. What a b*tch!      Anyway, this is a cool place. I don't work for any of the Irving libraries but I seem to know a good amount of people from there and what's been going on.      It's kind of nice out here because it is cloudy.      Hey, you ever notice the word "believe" contains the word "lie?"    Ah, my back itches...          (Yes, I am trying to make fun of the typical blog entry.)
