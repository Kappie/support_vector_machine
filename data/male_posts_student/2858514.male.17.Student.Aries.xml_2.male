I have done many past paper and discover that I'm very weak in Biology. Well, Bio isn't in my consideration list of S. 6 subjects, so just let it be...  Study with friends is really a good thing. When I have any problem, I can ask them. Puzzu and Aries are very smart, they helped me a lot. So, I'll try my very best~  I've done a lot of MC. My average result is good, but not good enough. 8-9 wrong questions at average for Chem and Phy. Next time I will do Phy Paper 1, Phy is really really important...
