I know I'll see most of my junior friends again next year, but it's just that the end is so near, it's like everyone is gonna go their seperate ways and I'll be there alone in a whole world. It is what is scaring the shit out of me!  It's just being alone!  And next year, everyone will be so busy, different classes and shit, not being able to do a lot of things. Man it's killing me! Fuck, and I don't want to go to India now, last 2 summers were so fulfilling meeting so many new people, it was great.  Basically I hate saying goodbye. I don't like saying it, and it is just that it is so final! I didn't even feel like then when I left El Dorado behind. It's just I want to accomplish so much and it feels so far and distant now. I'm just going to miss everyone!   All of a sudden I feel so alone....I hate ends...
