A bewildered and confused waiter asked him what the hell he  just did, and the panda stops and says "I'm a panda. Look it up". He (the  panda) tosses a badly punctuated wildlife guide over his shoulder.  The  waiter finds the relevant entry, and reads: "Panda. Large black and white  animal from China. Eats, shoots and leaves."
