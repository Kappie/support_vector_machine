Yesterday, my parents made us clean the back room(which i admit, Does look nice now), but they were freaking out when it took me more than a second to do something, or come to her, or finish my fucking sandwich she said i could take a break to have. And then today, i come downstairs and my brother is just standing there lookin at the microwave, and I asked(quite nicely i might add), "Whatcha doin?"  He replied in a really surly jerk-ass voice "Standing..." and I was tired of always taking shit from him so i said "i know you're standing, what are you DOING standing there? Are you waiting?" He goes "YES!!! God!!!" and I said "then why didnt you just SAY THAT YOU WERE WAITING, and i wouldnt still be TALKING TO YOU!." and my dad gets all indignant on me! He says "Jesse, dont be mean to your brother!" and I say "but did you HEAR him? hes been like this for forever!"  GOD my parents are like fucking BLIND to my brother latley, they let him mouth off to them(ok, they do say "dont talk to me that way," but they dont do anything about it), not make him cut is hair so he doesnt look bad, GOD they would take away my EVERYTHING priveleges if i was that much of a jerk!  Yeah, and other than that, my day sucked.  Once again, if my brother stops being an ass-hat and gets his hair cut, this post is goin down.
