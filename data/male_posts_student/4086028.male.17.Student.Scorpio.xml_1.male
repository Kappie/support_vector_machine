Unfortunately there's no alias, pseudonym, and low and behold no AKA in the name Daniel. I'm just not that cool.  Four weeks from now we'll have been through Beijing and have settled into the 'cosy' flat that will embrace us for a year. That is to say we've been updated to the role of teacher, transitioning across the great expanse that is the void between the teacher and the taught. Now weigh yourself down with the slight discomfort of only being able to say hello, ni hao.  For the next three weeks I'll be living whereI have been for the majority of my life. Muswell Hill, London. In terms of bags, we're talking the mutts.  Waigouren in Zibo simply refers to the status I will adopt on stepping foot in China. Quite simply, you are different. You are a foreign Devil.  This may be my first and last post, but I'm not generally one for computers.   I hate to see you go, but I'd love to watch you leave - Nick Cage
