It was alarming, to say the least. If the stats are to be believed, 40% of four-year students who enter the 9th grade in that district don’t graduate out of high school. Yes, you read it correctly - 40%! Of those who do graduate, only 7% have enough credits to be admitted to the state university or U.C. systems. The numbers are even worse for African-American students -- only 4% graduate with enough class credit to attend college. Of course, whether or not those who are able can afford to go is another question entirely.   School officials say the number-one problem is lack of reading skills, with many students not reading by the third grade. In case you don’t know, students in the Oakland Unified School District are primarily African-American. No doubt, this same poor scenario is being repeated in numerous inner-city school districts nationwide.   These new statistics further confirm a belief that I’ve held for some time now -- that we are, quite simply, AT WAR.   Not with another country. Not with foreign terrorists. Not with Muslims, Anthrax or dirty bombs. Not against the SARS epidemic, MonkeyPox, snipers, Mexican child-abductors, gang members, mad cow, african bees, medflys or any other fear inducing topic or group that the U.S. media continuously spooks us about. No, the real war is being waged right here at home by the system against us -- against people of color. That’s why it’s now more important than ever to reject bullshit that’s fed to us daily as truth and stay focused.   Focused on what, you may ask? Focused on each other. Focused on goals, achievement and education. Focused on progression within our own communities. On enlightenment. On the collective good of all of us. On the come up.   We are taught to fear each other, act ignorantly (as if ignorance = ghetto -- it doesn’t), be distrusting of all that is black and accept our faulty condition with a smile. So very little is now expected of us as a people that we often fail to aspire to achieve at all. This must change.   When asked what career goals they had, the majority of students questioned in the above-mentioned report said they either want to be rappers or atheletes. It’s a sad fact, but it’s no surprise, really. A good portion of their parents had the same aspirations. Besides, they seem to be the only career choices for us reinforced by the media. But remember that it’s parents, not teachers or the media, that should play the most important role in children's education. Every black parent ought to insist on academic excellence, and they must combat the perverse view among many black kids that serious scholarship is "a white thing." Remember that millions of people in this country survive and succeed in life in professions outside of music and sports. We all can’t rap or play ball -- it’s not for everybody.   But that’s the power of the media and entertainment. White-owned companies dictate our tastes through art and sell an often unobtainable dream to us everyday -- the $400,000 cars, the genocidal diamond-encrusted jewelry, and the lavish multi-million dollar homes -- all supposedly the rewards for bad behavior through “music.” But what they don’t tell us is that it is a lie more often than not. Many of the homes seen on “Cribs” and “How I’m Livin’” are rented by record companies to give the audience the impression that artists are doing better than the really are financially. Cars are leased, and the oh-so-fine sistas we see in the videos parading around half-naked are rented from model agencies. Don’t believe the hype. In an industry that supposedly values “keepin’ it real” they are the most plastic of all. And sadly, rather than protest and demand more ownership and money for what they create, many artists would rather front and play the role of affluence. Damn.   It is all a part of a very elaborate and well-thought out plan that emphasizes and glorifies our self-destruction. More mature and dangerously-influential artists (in the eyes of white companies) like myself are effectively prevented from reaching the people with messages that would surely enlighten. Instead, these companies opt for the young and dumb, with “anything goes” imagery that severely affects black youth negatively. Don’t be a statistic. How many advertisements for the military do you see while watching BET? While reading The Source? It’s no secret that the U.S. military recruits many college-eligible black men -- men that, in this day and age, end up being cannon-fodder for war-mongering rich white folks. And while it’s true that many black teenage boys start out as bright and disciplined pupils in elementary school, they often begin to drift toward mediocrity -- if not delinquency -- by the time they reach junior high. Nationally, only 34 percent of black male high school graduates go on to college. Add to this the disturbing trend of racist whites and self-hating selfish house niggas like Clarence (Uncle) Thomas and Ward Connerly to repeal affirmative action legislation and the picture gets grim indeed.   So what do we do? Well, we have to get right. The answer really is simple. Each one of us has to take the initiative to positively influence those who need direction. Sometimes parents are ill-equipped to handle the task, so it’s up to other individuals to set the correct example. Even though college is dismissed as being “white” or “uncool” by many in our communities who don’t know any better, it’s no secret that higher education affords more opportunities to those who have it. We must not allow ourselves to be excluded from the game out of the gate because we don’t have the proper credentials.
