I'm never going to do a montage for Girl's Camp ever again. What a waste of my precious time when I could be lazying around doing nothing whatsoever! I'm waiting for 4:00 to come around so that we can start our Ward Pioneer Fun day. Whatever that is. Ergh. So what's new in the life of YOU?! Yes you! that's who I'm talkin about!!! I feel so selfish using this. Quick, someone else post...........................NOW!
