What was this (stenciled) tag you ask?   None other than Lacan's Graph of Desire (version 1). Is this what urban warfare has come to? Can the tagger, if he is reading this, at least explain to me what the fuck the Graph of Desire attempts to illustrate? Che vuois?   Maybe Seen went back for post-doc.
