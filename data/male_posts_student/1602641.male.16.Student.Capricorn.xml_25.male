They had Ben Stein talking about how it would be political suicide for the Democrats to act like the capture of Saddam Hussein didn't matter (which, on New Year's Eve, is relevant how exactly?) They had the Amazing Mind Reading Kreskin predict that Bush would win big in '04 (and that it "didn't take a great deal of insight" to know that). They had the damn patriotic music and the God Bless America and Bloomberg hugging that Iraq POW with a tear in his eye and all the revelry and the GLAYVIN. It was like a big rehearsal for the Republican convention. How terribly irritating.  Oh, and didn't you just love what Rep. Chris Shays said about it? Priceless. Just priceless.
