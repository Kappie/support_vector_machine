Turns out, its a  urlLink pedestrian bridge  build alongside the Provencher Bridge in Winnipeg. Not your typical pedestrian bridge, the Esplanade Riel provides for restaurant space smack in the middle of the bridge. Unfortunately, piping water and sewage to the restaurant cost in excess of a million dollars (the bridge itself went spectacularly over-budget), and no entrepreneurial restauranteur is up to the challenge.    urlLink    The stunning Esplanade Riel urlLink     Harper's mockery has cast a fair amount of negative light on Murray, a "star" Liberal candidate, who rushed to defend his "signature project." Murray's philosophy concerning stewardship of the public purse is  urlLink well known :    Every once in a while, as fiscally prudent as you have to be, you also need a little extravagance to get people excited," Murray says.    A little extravagance to get people excited? How "excited" does Murray think Winnipegers get paying their property taxes, especially when they know that it will likely be flitted away on the mayor's current fancy?  Murray's Conservative opponent, Steven Fletcher, was fairly insightful in noting that, "Glen Murray and the Liberals deserve eachother...They both waste our money on unnecessary ventures." Exactly.  Also: As was pointed out  urlLink here , Murray was not always such a strident proponent of bridge construction. Things are getting rough for the Liberal star in a  urlLink riding  that was a classic example of vote-splitting on the right in 2000 [the combined Alliance-PC vote here in 2000 was roughly 20% (!) more than the winning Liberal candidate's share of the vote].   By a great coincidence, I am leaving to go to Winnipeg in roughly three hours. Hopefully I will have time to scope out the Esplanade Riel, and (if the conditions are right) utilize its million-dollar fixture.
