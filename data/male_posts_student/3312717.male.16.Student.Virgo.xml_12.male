Just thought I would post that because Mattson was wondering why he stopped posting. It is fun to leave anonymous comments there... Worms... What a strange game...   Anyways, back to Goat Strategy. In order to find out how to most effectively kill a goat I searched on Google for 'How to kill a goat.' I found this handy list http://www.capcas.com/50%20Ways%20to%20Kill%20a%20Goat.html . Although there really are only 34 ways, there are some important messages in here. "12. Let the goats into the corn bin." That one there obviously is very pertinent to HALO. What it means is "If you want to kill Goat, let him get into your flag base in Blood Gulch then blow the hell out of him." Here is an even more obvious one: "27. Run a panicked kid over with a 4 wheeler or a car." Obviously this is talking about us 'Hogging it up. Another good is here: "19. Drop a 1500 pound bale of hay on a goat." What this means is U.S. Bomb that baaaaaahhhitch.   Obviously, there are going to be more than one way to skin a Goat, but those are some of the more common ones 'cause they were on Google. Personally, my favorite will be the shotgun to the face. Nothing is more satisfying than seeing a blob of Goat lying on the ground after being shot with a high powered shotgun. Not only do you have the advantage of being close to him when he is dead, you can also easily squat him.
