That XC ar! Made me wait for him for so long!! An hour you know. Just standing there and waiting and waiting. 30 minutes passed and I can't see him. I started getting fed up and stormed here and there. I was thinking of doing something drastic, but it was against my better judgement to embarrass myself. Sigh....so I just cursed and scolded him till he arrived. So late!!  Hmm...we sat down in the foodcourt in CauseWay Point and discussed la. We discussed what to do, what to eat and the checklist. Ayiah. So much disagreements. Me and CQ saw the maximum amount we can spend there, we got kinda scared le. Our parents only giving us S$200, which is around RM4220. Yeah. Sigh. I think we have to scrimp and save and not waste money. Meow!!!  Hmm...after all the discussing and photocopying, we went down to go home. We stopped by Wendy's workplace to exchange pleasantries. The male colleage who is standing besides Wendy looked at us weirdly when we called for her. She told me that he think it's funny stupid that we would do that. O.o! She was kinda tired, after handling so many customers. Poor thing.  Hmm...after that, nothing really interesting happened. Heh. I am kinda excited about the trip, but also a bit worried. I am worried I would be homesick. Last year, just barely two days outta home, I got very homesick already. What about you, dear blog! I cannot update you le. Oh wait. There's a computer with internet connection at YH's aunt's place. Maybe I can go online to update you after all. Meow!!  Hm. I think I end this le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
