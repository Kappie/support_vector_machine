Jessica Simpson of course. lindsay asked why we werent going to see her. i laughed. lindsay asked.."No seriously..why arent we going to see her". It was then decided we would go, come hell or high water (is that the saying?) to see jessica simpson in concert that night. and we did. it was so random, but one of the best days of my life, not just this summer, but my life. i had so much fun, i laughed so hard, and jessica simpson, yes she is pretty awesome. she is a great performer. she radiates a warm, genuinely awesome feeling and you feel it in you. women, children, men, grandparents, all alike were all together just havin' a good time with jessica simpson. oh a bonus for me and lindsay. when we got there we were like, oh our tickets are all right..probably be able to see her...with big huge binoculars. turned out we were about 6 or 7 rows from the stage. we were about 10 feet away from jessica simpson.    but it's cool, cuz she is our best friend after all. she tried to hangout with us afterwards, but her agent said she had to do some sort of meet the press type thing. it's all good.    i'm going to leadership camp for the next few days. i think it'll be a lotta fun, i'm really looking forward to it.   i'm sorry i think this blog post probably let some of you down. but again..tonights post is a self-post. because i had the time of my life at jessica simpson's concert and i would do it all over again in a heartbeat. i am comfortable "in this skin". yes jessica, yes.
