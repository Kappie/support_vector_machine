Today I did.....nothing, just like its been for the past two weeks. Oh what fun =) Well Chadwick told me that I shouldn't need an invite. I should just invite myself because we're all that close. That made me feel way better about everything. Other than that, I watched Big Fish with my mom in the morning, then I watched Euro Trip with my parents (not a good idea kids!) Those nude scenes were great, but whats not great is getting a boner in front of your mom! Haha, yeah embarrasing but that movie was ok. I'm still sick with Ryan and Felix's never ending passing of the dreaded cold. Seems like I contracted the stuffy nose part of it. Two days ago I had a soar throat. Damn you Ryan! Well rather..damn you Felix (he started it ;) Tomorrow I'm planning on going to the beach with the crew. The twins and Sam cancelled at the last minute. Whatever forget them. My mom doesn't want me to go, but isn't the beach good for your sinuses and whatnot?? Well should be an interesting day. Peace in the middle east.
