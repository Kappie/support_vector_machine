One of the reasons is that the idea of a God is used throughout history as something that manipulates people, and so it is better not to believe in God. So then could it be said that since rocks are used at times to kill innocent people it is better not to believe in rocks. At least this line of argumentation that atheists use does not hold.  So this weekend I went to a socialist conference and it inspired me in a weird way--working toward building a community, but not just any community, an anarchist community. They have existed in the past, not too long ago and I would love to have that kind of community in my life. I am going to my organization's conference in a couple of weeks and am very excited to feel a sense of community for at least the weekend. It will be a small gathering of revolutionaries, but at least we will all be sharing a common dream and strategy to achieving that dream.  That is all for today.
