I went to the cinema yesterday (well, the 22nd) with a girl I met from the net called Lauren, and a few friends. We saw the new Lord of the Rings movie, it wasn't so bad, heh. The graphics were amazing, but I have to say, it was a bit too long at 3 hours and 20 minutes! Lauren and I spent the day sniffing these funky asstissues, so obviously an amazing day was had. Oh and just a few hours ago, a girl I like told me she liked me! Won't mention any names just yet though. I'll just say she has been mentioned in this diary before...
