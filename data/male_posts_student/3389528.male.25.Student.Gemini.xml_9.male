I have to clean my room, like CLEAN it; move my refridgerator over to Elenie's room; do laundry; pack; get checked out of my room; get my pants fixed (don't ask); get a new phone; and a bagillion other things.  Good grief.  Then we're driivng to New York, then to Ohio, and then to the Village.  yah right.
