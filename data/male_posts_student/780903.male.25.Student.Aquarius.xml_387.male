To the tune of "Be Our Guest" from "Beauty and the Beast"  "Choose my Class"  Choose my class! Choose my class! And I promise you will pass Large enrollments get me tenure, please Oh it'll be a gas  Come sign up Here I am And I'll cancel the exam Skip the plaintiffs And defendants I won't even take attendance  I will dance I will sing For the stuff tenure will bring So please come and help me reach critical mass  Go on and rank my course I promise no remorse Choose my class! Choose my class! Choose my class!  Want free food? And free beer? You sign up, I'll have them here Need a break? I can make Required readings disappear  I want you And your friends All before the sign-up ends Won't be gloomy, no complaining Cancel classes when it's raining  I tell jokes I do tricks Won't you help me with this fix I need monster-sized enrollment So I stay  And when I call on you I don't care what you do Choose my class! And you'll pass All the students I'll amass Choose my class! Choose my class! Choose my class!
