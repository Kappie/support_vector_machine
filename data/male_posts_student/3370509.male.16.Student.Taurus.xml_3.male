I am failing English and I might go to summer school if I fail this marking period, so I have to bring my grades up.  Hopefully I dont fail so I can go to Europe this summer. So I have to work all night.  For some reason, my whole body was soar today.  I dont know, but lately I have been active in gym.  Maybe thats why?  I kicked ass in hockey and basketball for 2 days straight.  Thats never happened to me before because I am always on the bleachers sleeping in that class.  I was as surprised as they were.  Exams are coming up and I might fail those. Heh.  Ill try to make it to next year though.  I want to graduate in '06.. Thats my year. :)  I have been slacking off on music lately.  I was supposed to give Melissa's CD to her last week on this day.  I never did.  I put it in my CD to see if it worked and it didnt, so I would have given her a blank CD anyways.  I guess I have to remake it.    Sorry babe. xoxo. ;)  Yea, well, Im off.  I might update it some more later.
