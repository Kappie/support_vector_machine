Thank you for that. One of the most important gifts that you gave me was the knowledge that I am completely and totally unprepared for being on my own. That I can be confronted by a complete stranger who tells me that he wants to talk to me--someone he's never met before--because he wants to take his life is scary to me. And what did I do? I ran back into your safe arms, back into the bubble where things like that don't happen and people like that don't exist. Do I have some growing up to do? Hell yeah. Am I ready? Hell no. There were plenty of good times though: staying up until 2:30 in the morning discussing religion, philosophy, life, and  Star Trek  with my kick-ass roommate; laughing over the rise and fall of the Hip Hop Empire with a group in the dining hall; playing a cut-throat game of ping hong in Gregory Gym. You and I got along pretty well, although your classes left a bit to be desired. I won't hold it against you...actually, I will, but we won't talk about that right now. Grâce à leaving your best at my disposal, I've seen that your schoolisn't exactly the place for me. Would I go there? If no other on my list accepts me. Is that a bad thing to say? Since when have I cared ;-) Despite your endless attempts to shove UT down my throat--and yes, I understand that that was your job--I also understand that you couldn't mask inherent problems I have with the school. Thanks for the food, though. It rocked.
