Anyways, now that I'm done with my irony for the day, I am really bored.  My dad doesn't get home until 7 or 8 tonight. Take that however you want, good or bad. It matters not to me.  I am going to homecoming next Saturday (18th). Girls confuse me sometimes. I won't get into the details.   Let's see, what else exciting happened, is happening, or will happen? You guys should know these things. Of course, if you did know, then you wouldn't need to come here, now would you?   8th grade. I was 13 years old. My brother was 17. Chris is handicapped. I don't know if I have told you guys about him or not. If I have, humor me. If I haven't, sit on the edge of your seats. Chris is a wonderful person. He is very social, but he doesn't talk. Very active, but he doesn't walk well. Older, but shorter. He is a contradiction of almost everything human-like. He is a gift from God. Chris has shown me to have love and compassion towards everyone, and I really try to do that. I try to be accepting of everyone, and only occasionally does someone rub me the wrong way.   In 8th grade, Christopher stopped eating. He used to be fed by an eye-dropper from my mom (not into the eye, mind you). One week, he just quit eating. I was very scared. Here, my older brother, my best friend, might die and we would never know the cause.   We took him to the emergency room, but they didn't know what was wrong. He doesn't talk much. The things he does say are very minimal and do not really convey his feelings. He can sign, but again, it's very minimal.  Our next door neighbor, Patty, is a trained special education teacher. She is another gift from God. One of the days that week, she came over to our house and asked my mom, "What if Chris just wants to feed himself?". That was the key. Christopher was tired of having my mom feeding him. So, the doctors suggested that we changed his diet from milk-based to juice-based.   The season in my life was the scariest one I have ever gone through. The mere thought of Christopher passing on honestly brings me to tears. I cried a few times last week because I was afraid of what would happen if I lost him.   My mom has always told me that God and Chris have a very special connection. God gave us, gave me, Chris on purpose. He knew what it would do to my character, and he wanted someone like me for the kingdom. God will always have me. Chris means a lot to me, and there are very few people who mean as much.   One of those people, will probably never read this. I will never forget her, no matter what happens. I don't  want  to forget her.   The "Site o' the day" is one I am sure Steve has seen. It is all about God and science. Showing evidence from science, that God exists. Not proof mine you, evidence. You can't entirely prove God exists, and you don't want to either. If you do, then it's going to feel like you have to worship him. God doesn't want that, and I don't want that for you guys.  Good night everyone. Take it easy.
