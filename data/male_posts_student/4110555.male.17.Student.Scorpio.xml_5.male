Now, I know that when pressure is lowered, the boiling point is lowered, but I have relatively little to no idea by how much it is lowered.  Well, after a bit of research I know more.  Apparently, the temperature at which water boils on top of Mount Everest is about 150 degrees F.  The pressure at that point is 30 kPa.  Pressure at sea level is 101 kPa.  So, in order to be able to use only solar energy to boil water (we are talking pure water here, not salt water), we would need to produce a pressure near (or below) 20 kPa (this is just a guess on my part... it might be lower).  Now, if we were to use other sources of heat (wood burning), we could get by with 30 kPa, or higher.  My question is, how hard is it to get a pressure of that magnitude.  I really have no idea.  I know how easy it is to add pressure.  For example bike tires are inflated to a pressure between 300 and 500 kPa.  I would suspect that in a rigid container, it would require the same amount of work to remove pressure as it does to add pressure (according to the physics equations, it should be about the same), so in theory, we should be able to produce near vaccuum like conditions (maybe sub 10 kPa) fairly easily.  I will continue looking up information on this to see if I can take the abstract idea of 10kPa and compare it to something more concrete.  Once we get back into school, we should start working on some proof of concept experiments.  I envision pumping air out of a rigid container (maybe something made out of glass) partially filled with water.  Once the air has been pumped out, we will test for either the time it takes the water to boil, or the temperature at which the water boils.  The hard part will be to create the low pressure system in a classroom situation.  Maybe we will machine a part to get a tight seal and use a hanheld pump.  We shall see.  -Ben Salinas
