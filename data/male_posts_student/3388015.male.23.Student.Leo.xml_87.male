We got a late start, since we stayed up so late the night before, but we got there around 3, walked the strip (a bunch of businesses selling stuff for cheap) and I got a 99 cent piece of pizza, a $3 bag of fresh kettle corn and I bought a keychain.  We laid on the beach for a couple hours but then headed home.  Traffic was awful and it took 2.5 hours to travel 60 miles.  Wow.  Here are a couple pictures.   urlLink    Venice Beach Strip   urlLink    Venice Beach  We got back to the house, watched Starskey  Hutch (a week earlier on DVD than anyone else ;) ) and then went to bed.  Tiring day for sure.
