Our neighbour, who is a brilliant landscape architect and alumnus from Norm's alma mater, insistentlyoffered her services to us. She drew up a beautifulplan, recommended her contractors and told us that she would be willing tosupervise the whole project... All this, free of charge. I was already imagininga breath-takingSpanish courtyard with airy palms, sprawling bouganviellaand a cool, relaxing fountain.Unfortunately, she bailed out one month into the project.So, the landscape challenge begins.    This past weekend, I was on a mission to get the best deals on planting materials. Costco had Queen Palms as their featured seasonal item. Norm managed to load upourSUV with four 15 foot tall palms, in the wind and heat. Actually, never mind the wind and heat - our poor SUV. Dirt and soil scattered everywhere.There we were, two Filipinos and four palm trees in a SUV, slowly driving down the streets at 20 mph with our blinkers on, and me trying to hold the pots from rolling around the trunk. Can we be anymore ghetto? The following day, we borrowed Dad's pick up truck.    This evening I strategically designed our plant layout in preparation for tomorrow. We willbe laying sod, preparing the planter areas and planting trees and flowers. We could use Uncle Roger's help right about now.    Inspite of all the minor set backs and working without our initial designer, I think we pulled through and came up with our own backyard vision. I can't waitfor the final results!
