So... having combed through my archives:   urlLink Exam Thoughts 1: All about outlining... the monster exam advice post    urlLink Exam Thoughts 2: "Yes, outlining's important, but you should do practice exams"    urlLink Exam Thoughts 3: "What about study groups?"    urlLink Exam Thoughts 4: "But the exam is only worth 100% of the grade!"   And some lighter exam-related stuff I stumbled across:   urlLink Top Ten Registrar Mistakes  regarding 1L grades   urlLink Twenty-five things  not to do the night before an exam   urlLink "The Twelve Days of Finals"  parody song
