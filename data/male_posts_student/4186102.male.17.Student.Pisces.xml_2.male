Everyone out at pine like might be sad... but also maybe not. talking about killing yourself kinda makes you think... why do i want to die... but once you think about that you think "why do i want to live" and they both have their pro's and con's. its an evenly balanced scale "should i or shouldnt i?". i've been talking to my friends resently and they keep saying the same things... "dont just think about yourself... you think killing yourself over a few things would b best?..." like really you dont know what i'm going through and what kinda stress (theres that scapgoat again) i'm under. i know a few people that would gladly kill me, no because the dont like me.. but because they know the feeling, the feeling of being alone, of not living up to your parents standerds, of not living up to anyones standerds.. not even yours. everyone you talk to about killing yourself will tell you not to, with good reason... but sometimes you cant see their reasoning. and some how you still want to, eveything just doesnt add up in my head. i also just realized another reason i would want to die, "thinking about others befor yourself" i've been doing that for ???? i dont know how many years but its just getting to me.... making them happy befor me? why... that makes no point in you excistance then to make your self unhappy and others happy?, you just never know who will leave or who will care.. thats why i'm going to hold back for a while, hoping someone can show me the meaning of life.  ttfn Cody
