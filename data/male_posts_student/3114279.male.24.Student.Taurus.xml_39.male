      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn. I'm posting when I have nothing to say, so expect boredom. Last time I was in the computer lab I got scientifically drenched, so here's to hoping it won't happen again. Man, today it was blunder of blunders when my cellphone went off during class. I am usually good about turning that thing off, but today I fucked up. Drat. Apparently giant fucking spiders are invading our house. You know, although I don't like spiders on me or appearing suddenly when I don't expect them, I kind of like them. I definitely won't kill them, because of spider karma. I mean, anything that could possibly eat a roach for me isn't all bad. Which is why I like my cat Xerxes. Anyway, I'm boring today.
