One of his songs "Tum to Pyar Ho Sajni" has always been one of my favourites. In fact when I was young , I had this Taped Chitrahar cassette which had these songs Tum to Pyaar Ho  Pankh Hote to ud aati Re (I understood very little Hindi then !!)  I  was very fascinated by the music.                                           Its sad to note that he is a forgotten man today.
