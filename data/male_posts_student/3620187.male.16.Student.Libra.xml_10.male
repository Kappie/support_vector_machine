Hey, i just thought this would be a good thing to share w/ yall. Its my personal strugle with being the odd man out. Im sure there are many other stories out there that are probably ten times worse then mine but hopefully this one can make a diffrence in your life. In Junior High I was teased alot, and back then I didnt know how to take it very well so every little thing hurt. And I dont know why they chose me to pick on. I might not have been as "cool" as them in there eyes but did they have to point it out in front of everyone else? Anyways, the next year came and it was the same story just worse. They always seemed to some how know the one thing i was strugling with at the time and pick on me about that. Even though i was never put through physical abuse, the mental abuse was enought to make an impact on my life. So then the next two years were came and the teasing became less frequent to me, but more frequent on others. But even though they stoped picking on me as much, i still had the scars from those first two years. My self-estem level was killed in those two years and i've never been able to recover it. So im very self consious. Like one friend will blow me off one time because there busy and I'll automatically assume that they dont like me anymore or that they never liked me, they just pretended to. And this has destroyed a couple of my realationships with people. Also, its held me back in life because i just cant seem to get past what they told me i was in those two years. Its like something is always in my head tellin me im not good enough and theres always someone better. Which stinks because I know if i keep this up ill never amount to anything. Right now im considering going in to counciling to try to work this out so i dont have to deal with it the rest of my life. Now this isn't ment to be a guilt trip for those who have ever made fun of someone, but as just a reminder of the how u can hurt someone with an "inocent" little joke. ---Anonymous     With that said i think that its safe to say that...Ya Joking may not get to You yourself to the point to where itll make you self conscious about yourself...but everyone has there presssure points...And i believe everyone out there has at least once in their life felt self conscious...or just flat out hurt by another persons remarks thrown at them...You may be like me and just joke around with a friend and say something that u didnt mean seriously at all... but sometimes people do take it the wrong way and ya...they may not show it up front....but back at home or wherever...it hurts....so ALL of this to say....YEa its cool to have fun and joke around but ya theres always a limit ya know...just always keep those in mind...and hey...maybe try Building someone up every once in a while...I know thats something i need to work on like a motha....or a fatha....or...nvm....but ya...thats it for today....  PS:just BE REAL tomorrow...thats what people want...to be real with them...no wonder REAlITY tv is at an all time HIGH right now...cuz people are starving for people to just be REAL...so...be yourself...haha...its more fun that way anyways...
