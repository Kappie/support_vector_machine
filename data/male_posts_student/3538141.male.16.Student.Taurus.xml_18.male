My Monday-Friday routine looks like this:  7:45-8:00  Get up 8:00-8:45  Train 8:45-9:15  Shower, Breakfast 9:30-5:30  Work  Then eat, and train for another 1-2 hours.  Saturday morning is reserved for sleeping, the afternoon for training and I can socialise in the evening.  And Sundays are currently crammed full with socialising.  Speaking of which, Li earned the Sam Wilkin Quote of the Week on Sunday, with 'Giles... doesn't have tiger written all over him' (I  told  you I'd post it Li).  As a result of all this, I'm bloody knackered.  I've just got to keep thinking of the money from work and the benefits of training twice a day.  Still, work isn't so bad... I'va laready mentioned the abundance of Jaffa cakes at work, and quite often the boss is out, leaving me alone to take payed breaks playing games on my mobile phone.  Still nowhere to sleep though.  The really annoying thing is that when I get home I no longer feel tired.  Very confusing.  But the 3pm slump really hits me hard.  Anyway, I've had the morning off to collect the Spanish Prize at school on the last formal day, but I need to get to work now.  Let;s try to stay awake.
