Put clothes on the floor 3. Put clothes in the washer 4. Put clothes in the dryer 5. ONLY take those clothes out of the dryer when steps 1,2,  3 have been done with a NEW set of clothes, thus forcing the clothes in the dryer to move to the couch so as to make room for the clothes needing to be put in the dryer.  *WHEW* and I'm SPENT.  so step 6 basically is me watching the pile on the couch grow to the point of distasteful living.  The rest of my apartment, well, it looks pretty damn clean.  Then there's that God-awful mountain of whites and colors and cotton-blended, JCrew, Banana Republic, GAP, T-shirt, 2(x)ist Underwear, sock and jean.  This colorful mountain that always tempts me to lay in it.  Something about a huge pile of clothes is, to me, much like a pile of leaves to a 8 year old. I just want to DIVE into it and possibly take a nap.  My dog would, why can't I?  Don't be fooled, however, because there IS indeed a system here.  I don't simply live like trash.  It works quite well actually.  It's almost like the pile and I live via survival of the fittest (somehow that makes sense coupled with the explanation to follow, not sure why).  You see, as steps 1 - 6 get accomplished, the pile doesn't exactly grow exponentially because at one point or another, I need underwear.  SO, I go to the couch after rolling out of bed, and I dig through until I find some underwear.  Same goes with socks, a shirt, and so on.  Basically the couch is my closet right now.  Though the system "works" I'm still embarrassed by it.  I refuse to let anyone inside my door.  The UPS man was probably even surprised this morning when he woke me up pounding on the door and caught a glimpse of the "pile" over my shoulder.  (I throw the term "morning" around freely as it was in all actuality 1:15pm when I rose to greet the world  the UPS man).  Now is the point where I set forth the goals.  The goal is to get this mountain of clothing into its proper place and once again fill my empty hangers and empty drawers.  The goal is to do that by tomorrow or at least find someone who will.  The goal is... oops, the dryer just beeped that it's done, gotta go (see step 5)
