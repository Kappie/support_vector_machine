But why am I such a dork?  I hate e-bay... thats why.  Every time I try and get Pokemon Ruby for my newly acquired GBA, I get outbid at the last second.  Im thinking that it just massively sucks.  And I dont want to pay $45 for it because I am very very poor, so hopefully Im trying to not blow the bank on this one... ANYWAYS...  Yeah, today was a good day.  For the first time, I got out of clinicals and didnt want to blow my brains out or drink myself to oblivion.  No one came up to me begging to die or for me to kill them today.  We actually had a shitload of fun.  Me and Shelly (another CNA student) were lucky enough to be sent to Activity Time in the "not-so-bad" Alzheimers unit today.  People were friendly, laughing, smiling, holding conversations, and just thrilled to have us as company.  First, we had to watch Oprah, because some of the women would get pissy if you turned off their Oprah to do activities.  So we did that until about ten.  Then we played ball for a good hour.  Its just one of those really light plastic bouncy balls that you can get at target for a couple of bucks, but the old folks were having a blast.  It was sweet.  A few went off to the other activity part where they were making brownies (special ones (just kidding)) and then the rest of us kept playing ball.  Soon, there was a crowd of people playing ball.  This one old man would whip it at everyone else, but he would bounce it, so no one ever got hit in the head.  And also there was this blind lady, and every time I would put the ball in her hands so she could play, the old man would grab it from her, and just whip it at someone else.  So anyway, the activity lady came back with a set of trivial persuit cards from probably the 60's (as there were very few I knew) and I would ask questions, and if they remembered them, they would say the answers.  So good times were had by all, and we were sad that we had to go back to the other side of the building.  So then lunch time rolled around, and there really wasnt anyone who needed helping that I hadnt had yet, so I waited and was just walking around, talking to those who could respond to me, and I helped one of my favorite residents to walk around the hallways for exercise.  She even got to go outside the security doors, which is huge, because they live in such a small area, it was good to get her out, and she was so excited.  SO excited, she peed herself.  Oh well.  Whatcha gonna do...  All in all, it was the best clinical day I've had yet, and it gives me hope that my job will not always be so horrible and depressing.  That, and it taught me old people rock at playing ball...
