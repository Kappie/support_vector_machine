But now the Twins win, and it works fine. Clearly, there's a higher force at work here. Lets just hope that Blogger continues to work from here until November.  The game wasn't on TV today, nor is it tomorrow, so it's a fine time for Blogger to start working again, when I can't even really write about what I saw anyway. *Sigh* Perhaps this blog is doomed...  Back tomorrow (hopefully).
