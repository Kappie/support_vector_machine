Can you guess where I got it from?). I decided that a "Topic o' the day" is much better than a "Site o' the day". Much more interaction. If you want to speak out on the topic, you may post a comment at this post, and this post  only . It will be much easier to keep track of. You can always remain anonymous and need not answer anybodies questions. These are your thoughts and believes. I will not let them be violated here. I will not start with the topic and let someone else who wants to. I think it will be much easier this way. Remember, the topic is abortion. Guys, please, speak out. I know a lot of guys don't have opinions but I want to hear them.  My day has been going great. Although this computer I use occasionally freezes whenever I am typing and someone is IMing me. I think I am almost ready to go back to my old one. I hope everyone is having a great day today. That is all for today. Um...Goodbye. Err...Erm...Adios.
