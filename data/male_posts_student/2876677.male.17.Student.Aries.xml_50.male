Just so everyone knows, I am against war.  War entails having people kill people.  I am against murder. "Thou shall not kill" does not have a wartime clause.  Turn the other cheek.  "What about protecting our rights?" you ask.  We have no rights.  Jesus was killed and he did not fight back.  He did not allow his disciples to fight back.  So a dictatorship might not be the best political-economic system.  That is alright.  I am against trying to pacify madmen.  I am not a pacifist.  Non-violent resistance.  If they win, they win.  So we have no rights.  Do we need the freedoms to be Christian?  No.  So quality of life is not the best in Communism.  The church flourishes under great persecution.  Think church at Smyrna.  Night.
