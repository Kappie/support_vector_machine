But I was embarrassed during one of the p5's lesson, Why? Coz I told them that we will compile the results with the results of the cookies.. And the best ting is, one of the girls said :"But Teacher.. We are not baking cookies..." Then i realised that i said someting wrong, DAMN MALU sia! And the manager from my company was sitting behind observing everything.. GONE! But he seemed like a nice guy, hope he didnt mind, LOL!  Oh well, in the mid of the lesson, a cockroach came out, and the kids were running around, lol. The form teacher, who is a lady, seems scared at that time, but she took out a tissue and tried to catch it, LOL. But b4 she can reach the cockroach, xiao qiang ran away to my side and im already armed with two tissue papers, so i caught it easily. I practically crushed the tissue paper in my hands and the kids said :"Teacher, dont crush it can? So cruel.." WTF, theres SPCA I know, but now theres SPCP (S'pore Prevention Towards Cruelty to Pests) ?   Whats with this sudden love towards pests nowadays? A few weeks ago, i caught a lizard in my room and i threw it away, and my fren said :"Aiyo, why kill it?".. I still rem that a long time ago, people always smack pests with slippers, newspapers, etc. And now? Crushing a cockroach/lizard in a tissue paper is cruel, so is smacking a mosquito on ur arm cruel? Mosquito is also a pest rite? Ermz... someone enlighten me please?  Ok, seems like a lot of ppl commented on me typing my current underwear in my blog, Im sure some ppl are interested to know rite? LOL. So to make everybody happy, why dont u vote for it at  urlLink http://www.funvote.com/fun/underwear/  Excercise your power to vote! (*For Ages 21 and above please)     YES?      NO?
