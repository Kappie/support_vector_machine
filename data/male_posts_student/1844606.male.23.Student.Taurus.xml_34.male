So now, every year, not only do I sit back and think about the monstrosities that occured in DC, Penn. and NYC, but I am also reminded that Grandpa isn't around anymore.    And I know that if he were here, he'd be watching the Cubs game with me.  But maybe he's still watching, just from a better seat.
