But, I barely had the time to read today with all the occurences.  First, my day was very typical. Got online, and my good friend Brandon was on. After a while, my other friend Bob got on and we played a few games of Starcraft (Online/Offline PC Game). Then, my day started to pick up. I eventually played some basketball after eating uptown. I noticed to girls riding their bikes, one of which I knew. I debated about inviting them swimming, but didn't. I drove around town for awhile, and ended up running into Andy. I talked with him a while, and went and picked his brother Scotty up to play some basketball. Dylan was skateboarding, like always, and we conned him into playing. We were sweating half to death it seemed, so we ended up going swimming. By the time we got ready, however, we were dry and no longer hot. Thus the pool felt freezing, and we only swam for a mere 11 minutes. Perhaps I have gone in too much detail of the events so far, but I guess it is better this way. Well, I loaded my bike in the back of the truck, which I might add is quite the choir since I have a bed cover, since I decided that riding my bike was a good idea. We ran into dylan again, and we rode around. Sarah and a girl (who I couldn't recognize at the time) were oustide and she said Hi to me, how nice. (only took three times of riding by, lol) Scott and I were playing some basketball at the other park, when some girls walked by. Considering the way they took, I got the feeling that one or both of them might like us. They starting swinging, and that (to me) gave it away. I couldn't help but almost laugh a little. I didn't say anything to them though, at least until they left. I said "later", as if to at least acknowledge their presence. We rodeour bikes by them a little while after, and I think one of them side Hi, but I can't be sure. Scott pussed out (ironic that we are both named Scott, I know) and went home at some point. I however, wanted to keep riding my bike for a little while. This, turned out to be a good thing, at least so it seems. Some girl called me by name, and I replied "what?". "Come here" she commanded. I thought about it for a second, and did go over. I knew the girl, her name is Calista, and might I add she is annoying. She introduced me to a girl named Laura, and informed me that she thought I was hot. Gee, how nice. I would myself be pissed if one of my friends did that, but on the other hand, if it didn't backfire, my anger would turn to joy. She (Calista) kept bugging me about various things, all regarding Laura. Quite annoying she is, but she served her purpose yet. Truth be told, Laura is quite pretty. She is only 14, but... oh well. I feel that I took too much of a shy approach to the whole situation. I did talk to her, but not that much. She is staying with her cousin, but she leaves tommorow. Hopefully, I can catch her before she leaves. And this time, not be so damn shy. If not, all is well. I can get her phone number from her cousin. Sorry about rambling, but there was just a lot to tell.
