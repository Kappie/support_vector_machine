So me and a couple of friends decided to go see I, Robot. We get there, and one of us hears ahissing noise. Turns out one of tires is flat. So we go in, because we're gonna miss the movie. We come out and realize that we must exchange the tire on the car for the pure rubber "donut" tirein the trunk. Well, we get four of the bolts off, but the last one just WILL NOT MOVE. So we waited, called parents, waited some more, and finally, after four hours, we(three of us and our dads) just decided to leave it there and tow it in the morning.
