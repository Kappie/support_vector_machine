It was three artists, dont remember their names but who cares, i mean, they sucked! ok lets rate the painings:  Annoying. The guy just grabbed a brush, dipped it in his six color staedler kids paint, splotched a bit on the paper and "there you have it, its a volcano!" bleh. and then he folded the paper to make a "visual effect" on the art. on the volcano. i mean, come on,  the paintings sucked .    ok now the wooden things. its basically a piece of wood that has een shined out. then you make three little holes: the boobs, and the stomach. then in the holes put a stone in them and it looks like a pregnant person. you know what the worst part is? that  every single wooden carving had the exact same shape ! Then there was this piece of wood that had like writen "ove, love, lo ve, lo ve?" written on it. then there was a dick right below it. this was probably the worst thing in the WHOLE exhibition. i mean, i think the guy who wrote this crap really wins the prize.    urlLink http://www.funfreepages.com/prize/yourock.jpg   So what the heck, i realy wrote that on the guest book.    uhm now there comes the glass things. ok its pieces of pearlescent crushed between two glassplateswith different colors. it was generally a triforce with different colors inside a circle. if thats art, well good riddance.    some of the sculptures were cool, but they  were all the typical "girl coming out of a rock" thing . there were about 5 of these. if i was gonna make a scuplture, id make batman climbing out of a stone with a hotdog in his hands and name it "scotch tape" and it will have a better name than evryone else's art. and i will become leader of the world and paralize you with my lazer beams.    but thats just me.
