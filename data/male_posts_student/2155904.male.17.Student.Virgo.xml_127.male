This year has not been that bad.  Tyke's work ethic has made it not that bad but after last year, this year has been something of a breeze.  Sure, Tyke thought at the beginning of the year his classes were easy enough to get a 4.0 in and yet he comes out with below a 3 for the first time ever, but hey ;).  Back to the current though.  Damn, Tyke's skinny.  Tyke just looked at his left arm and went (literally) "Damn!  I'm skinny."  Tyke is 5'11.5" and weighs 132 pounds.  But he is an animal playing basketball so watch out.  Again, back to the current, although technically that last rambling would also be considered skinny unless Tyke is dead.  He could be dead to another world in a far off place.  If you look at stars for example, many (all??) have already blown up but we just see them in the past.  So yeah, Tyke is most likely dead to some other thingy out there.  Tyke does believe that there is other forms of life.  If you think of how many galaxies there are in the universe then the probability of there not being life has to be so minute that it is just...wow, mind boggling.  Yet again, back to today.  This time for real though.  Tyke got up at the 6:20 hour.  And was quite tired.  After his shower he came back into his room to pick up his cell phone and shoes he is going to wear for the day (which lately has been his And 1's as he wears those for wt train and it is easier to just wear them to school everyday).  When he got in his room he just about collapsed on his bed cuz he was so tired.  He really wanted to just let his body fall forward from where he was standing and let it go where it wants.  But that would have been painful as he was about 5 feet from the bed so he would have smacked hard into the end of the bed with something he most likely would not want to have smacked up against anything.  But he didn't do any smacking.  Instead he did some snacking.  1.5 Chocolate Chip Kudos bars.  He just can't eat breakfast very often.  He is hungry and knows he will be later on but he just can't force himself to eat enough to constitute a healthy breakfast.  His mom and him actually talked about that at dinner for some reason.  But Tyke had a very slow day.  1st period was a group test and that certainly didn't wake him up but it did allow him to try and showcase his intelligence.  He did to an extent.  But 2nd period he was dead.  3rd period also dead.  He and Purdy were supposed to work on a gov thing but he could hardly focus on anything.  Not even her ;p.  And certainly not the material as it was some stupid diseases or bureaucracy crap.  Won't matter in the end.  4th period he sorta started to wake up.  By then end of the period he was pretty awake as he had been doing his "Scroggmentations" as Amed coined.  Tyke thinks he is pretty good at them.  He at least gives Amed a case of the chuckles so that is worthwhile enough.  Tyke took the Avalon out with Dr. Phil and Amed to Mickey D's.  Decent enough.  The rest of the day wasn't much fun.  When Tyke was tired he sort of seemed like he was in a bad mood.  Maybe because he was tired but maybe not.  Hopefully because he was tired.  But probably not.  Not because he was tired.  Not not because he was tired.  Maybe because he was tired.  But yeah, that's about all on that.  After school was some more Tyke-Tyke time.  He just played some ESPN and the usual after school activities with himself.  Then he ate some Chinese food with his parents and talked about his heart and chest and Halloween costume and 70s pornstars and the weather.  Ya know, what everyone talks about with their parents.  Well, tomorrow is going to be good because not only is it Wednesday and semi-good weather time but Tyke is going to fill up his car with gas in the morning (meaning he will be awake and pumped-get it??-for school) and the Decathletes will be back from their conference thingy as well.  So Dotti and Haras will be back and Tyke will enjoy that thoroughly.  That is one great thing to look forward to about this Wednesday.  Hmm...what else???  Oh yeah, SLEEP!  Another thing, after school Tyke went with Skippy and Macaroon to Ted Meyer's after school for some "shopping."  Man, there is some funny stuff there.  That monkey was insanely cool.  Cats don't deserve that toy.  Humans do.  Waaaaaahhhhhhh-waaaaaahhhhh-aaaaaahhhhh-rreeeeeeerrr!  Damn, Tyke forgot another thing about his day.  In 5th period today he had a substitute.  Boy was this cool.  Tyke left at 12:29 and walked a little bit before meeting up with Mandy in the halls for a nice hug and a little chat.  Then he met up with Macaroon and they went and listened to a song and got their butts and backs heated in Tyke's car.  They just went out to the parking lot and chilled there for a little.  Macaroon then went back to class but Tyke kept walking around.  And around.  And around.  He finally came back to class at 12:52.  He grabbed a few Zingos (like Altoids) from Macaroon and then headed back out without notifying the sub for some more adventures.  This time he left at 12:53.  He still didn't find anyone to talk to though so he ended up just walking around the entire school multiple times and 7 times past Ritzer's class cuz he knows a lot of people in there and wanted to see if anyone was coming out.  But nobody did.  So Tyke just kept on walking and walking and walking.  He and Macaroon figured he walked more than a mile after he returned to class at 1:07, only 2 minutes before the clean-up bell.  So he was gone for 37 minutes.  69.8% of that class period he was outside walking the school.  It was just great.  But damn, Tyke's legs are tired.
