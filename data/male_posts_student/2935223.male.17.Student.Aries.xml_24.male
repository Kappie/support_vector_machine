I really don't have anything to talk about, besides the fact that Steve and Ervin spent most of the day at my house..and it was kool. I'm kinda worried about the party, tomorrow....and i know why.... because lately there has been sum contention between sum people*not saying who* and it firghtens me that the party could take on a negative nature because of this...I know it's not my party, and I really shouldn't kare, but I am anyway.....oh well.....see most of you tomorrow...or today....depending on when you look at this... Peace!  Spense
