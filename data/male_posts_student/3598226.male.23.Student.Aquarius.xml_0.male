And it seemed like the later in the week it got, the later I was staying up at night - which is not a good thing when you've got to get your ass out of bed by 5:30AM.  The people in the class made it all worthwhile, though.  They're a great bunch of kids who've got solid blocks on their shoulders.  I liked em all and they'll be great at their jobs.  Are ya feeling warm and fuzzy yet?  And I've been (re-)introduced to  urlLink Friendster  this week.  That's an amazing little place.  I never knew that I knew so many people!  And to see all their cute, sexy, crazy, funny, phreaky pictures really satisfies my oft-neglected voyeuristic tendencies.  Oh, who'm I kiddin - they're not oft-neglected.  I'm a friggin snoop!  These are some of my favs:      This is a great picture - she looks like she's at the beginning of a good laugh.            Ho-Ho-Ho, shave cream styl-ee!           I love you Mimi!!!
