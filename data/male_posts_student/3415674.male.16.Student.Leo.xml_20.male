(nameless)   Packing memories in suitcases And throwing them into the ocean Leaves me free to be opened and broken I say I wont let them get to me anymore But I know its too early I have the awnsers to their questions But I wont let them know the truth disconnected, for what I shouldent be   Numb   Everyday is colder, my body is growing numb I've never felt like this before It feels like nothing can be done I look at all the photographs Of summers that have passed and remember all the memories and all the times that we laughed but then the clouds came again and I wish that it would snow and I wish that you would be mine again but this game is growing old.   Gone   I see through you Like you see through me We play this game but we never leave All I know is that I can't control My soul inside/I'm letting go  Look away cause I'm not here Insignificant for many years The shell is strong The love is gone So I'll stay here like I always have but I wish I could reach out and destroy the past  Ink stains the hands as a reminder of the past toxic like the memories I wish I didn't have.
