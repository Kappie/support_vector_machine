At this point I decided: "Screw Open Source software deployment as a job. I'd rather make good money codin' for microsoft" Ya know some of this code is reeeeeeeeeeeeeaaally good. Impresive stuff. Other code is just freakin' stupid. The hack apon hack (There are so many comments saying: // *HORIBLE, BAD HACK*) Heres one of my fav. quotes:  File: private\windows\media\avi\verinfo.16\verinfo.h:       *       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      *       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      * !!!!!!!IF YOU CHANGE TABS TO SPACES, YOU WILL BE KILLED!!!!!!!      *       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!DOING SO FUCKS THE BUILD PROCESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      *       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      *       !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
