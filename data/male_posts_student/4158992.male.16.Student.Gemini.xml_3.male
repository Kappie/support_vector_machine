I don't like BBQ, it's a litle barbaric i think, just roasting meat on a fire, just like our ancestors did thousands of years ago, and that may sound like fun, going back to our "roots", but i dn't like it. I love my comfort too much, and comfort and BBQ don't go together for me. Another thing i don't like on BBQ is he fact that it is something that you do  outside , and i really don't like the idea of sitting in the sun. So right after lunch, i fled inside, after my computer, with the excuse is was doing some research for one of our guests about  psoriasis . Three hourrays for Google! The rest of the afternoon was so fuckin boring, i don't even want to describe it here...  Now i am watching a documentary with my parent about  Asia after dark . I think  bizarre  is the word that fits best for this kind of docu. A lot of sex, Japanese fetisches and other weird things that happen there. You must have seen this to believe it really happens.
