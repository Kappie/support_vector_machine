It's about how to treat our life, as follows: " It's not about what happened in the past or what you think might happen in the future. It's about the ride, for Christ's sake. There's no point going through all this crap if you're not gonna enjoy the ride. And you know what? When you least except it, something great might come along. Something better than you even planned for. " It's a very good apocalypse, right? 我看了一部電影,叫做" 遇上波莉  裡面有一段對白我很喜歡,講的是怎麼樣看待我們的生活,它是這樣說的: " 過去發生了什麼,或是你覺得未來會發生些什麼,那一點都不重要.正如同耶穌所說的,重要的是那一段過程啊.如果不能夠把這些亂七八糟的事情都放下的話,又怎麼能夠感受到生命的意義.你知道嗎?當你跌到谷底的時候,某些好事可能已經悄悄的發生了,甚至還會超過了你的想像. " 這真的很有啟發性,不是嗎?
