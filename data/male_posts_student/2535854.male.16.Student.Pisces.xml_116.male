NOW.Stuff came up and I missed Rodgers and Hammerstein!Gurhg.Then another thing came up which left my blood boiling and sizzling more than the sizziling steaks at the Collesium!  Then!.Impatientness.Urgh.No point in writing it out.I`ll just be a bigger bitch.  Then I scolded away at the Jahiliyah fella.called a guy a bastard is public and regret NOT saying it out LOUDER than I already did.Gurgh.  Gurgh.So much high BP and so little cures.Gurgh.Much more here done but i`ll leave so it aint bring em back to my mind.And I grabbed my gloves and busted away at everything I can..punching bag,rolled up carpers..Yikes.Sounds like I need help.I have a burning spot on my right elbow and a slight wound on my right ring finger knuckle and I was wearing gloves!but gloves were alright..haha..  *HISSSSSEEESSSSSS AT THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!*
