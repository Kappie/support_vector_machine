Viewer discretion is advised ;-)  *********  I never expect to come down to Austin and learn something, yet every time I come, I do.  Spending the last couple of days here with my grandfather has been wonderful, to say the least.  I was quite a bit reserved at first simply because I haven't stayed with him in over a year.  Apprehension was expected.  Nevertheless, this visit has been a wonderful opportunity for me to rediscover just how awesome--and we're not talking about  the warped, hideous teenage "awesome;" we're talking about "awesome" in its truest sense--a man my grandfather is.  I will never be able to understand how he, at 74 years of age and fighting a losing battle against pancreatic cancer, can remain as active, positive, and upbeat as he always is.  It's all about his attitude.  He never hesitates to talk to people; he's a born socializer.  He has the ability to make friends with the prescription-taker lady at a downtown clinic, he can joke around with the waitress at Red Lobster and make her crack what is perhaps her only real smile of the day, and he can express such an interest in my life as to make me feel for the first time in a while that others do have a real and vested interest in me and my future.  I write this only because this, as I said before, has been an incredible week.  Last night, my grandfather (or PaPa--pronounced paw-paw--as I like to call him) and I went to the Black-Eyed Pea.  Few were around, and even the restaurant staff seemed exhausted and uninterested.  After I engulfed one delicious chicken fried steak (and believe me, that's quite a compliment to BEP) and took a few pokes at what were supposed to be mashed potatoes, PaPa began asking me questions about where I want to go to college, what I plan to major in, and what my career interests are.  My automated answer began as I gave him my laundry list of colleges and my schpeel on where I stand in terms of career prospects.  However, he didn't stop where most people do; PaPa wouldn't bePaPa if he had.  Instead, I was treated to some of the best advice I've received in a long time.  My grandfather's a religious man, but he's never tried to force his beliefs on me (which has saved us from mashed potato fights at the dinner table).  Instead, he's been a strong force in encouraging me to find my footing spiritually and emotionally, which, as he says, will allow me to begin to separate what I want and like from what I don't.  The way he said it was so much more impactful than I just did, but it left it's mark, for sure.  I have seen just how far-reaching his influence is.  We attended a Tuesday-night worship gathering at Bethany United Methodist Church where Crossfire, an awesome local Christian rock band, was performing.  I usually stay away from worship en masse, but it was quite an enjoyable experience.  The best part of it was seeing so many people come up, hug my grandfather, and then proceed to tell me how lucky I was to have such a great man as a grandfather.  If only they knew how much I know that.  To make a long story longer, he and I went to Red Lobster today to meet a fraternity brother for lunch.  We did so because PaPa is determined to connect me with every person he knows who can help me, which is something that few people have ever done for me.  In fact, earlier this morning, he connected me with a certain Dr. Hill, who is a leading force at UT-Austin with whom I will now be meeting in July to discuss admissions, et cetera.  That wasn't enough, though.  PaPa wouldn't be PaPa if it had been.  I was able to meet a prominent Austin business man, Vice President of Global Supply Management at AMD, and the aforementioned fraternity brother who gave me some great advice on college and breaking into the business world after college (and post-MBA, which, thanks to him, I am now set upon getting) as well as a nifty business card that will allow me to remain in contact with him throughout the coming school year.  All right, at this point I know I've driven off everyone, but that's okay.  I needed to get this off my chest.  My grandfather's a great man, and it is my sole desire that he be alive at least one more year so that he can see me get accepted into college and see me walk across the stage and get the diploma for which I have been working so hard over the past thirteen (well, by  then  thirteen) years.  His warmth, love, wisdom, and compassion have touched not only me, but others.  The day that he dies is a day that this planet will have lost one of its greatest human beings.  Many will be strongly impacted by his departure, but few more so than myself.  He has been a source of inspiration, courage, and determination for me since I was old enough to comprehend just how influential he is.  Although I despise and hate to use the word "witness," he, if any, has done it.  I can only hope that he will be dearly rewarded for it when his time finally comes.  *********  You may now return to your regularly scheduled programming :-)
