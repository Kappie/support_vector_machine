We play CS until 3AM. 8:00AM we wake up, unpack and unnetwork our computers.  We drive to Burger King, eat breakfast, and then go to Thunderbowl.  There we tell Logan Yard and Alex Franz that we ain't bowling, but going lanning.  We finally arrive at the LAN, network our shit, and Chris Parker comes in.  Woohoo!  So us four are in the corner for eight hours on CS amidst 40 other people paying Quake 3, Warcraft 3, Starcraft, and Halo.    Then 150 bucks worth of pizza comes, Zach wins the Halo tournament, and its finally on the CS tournament.  Since stats showed that Kyle, Chris, and I were in the top 10 (me being number 2) we were bumped up to automatic 2nd round.  We mauled our competitors and it was down to us and the college kids/organizers.  Of the 2 maps and 40 some rounds we play, we only won maybe 10.  And 3 from me.  So they won.  And we got no money prize.  But they told us that no one ever wins more than 5 against them, so I was really happy that Kyle, Chris, and I are the Best CSers in town.   And maybe of this region.   Well, maybe Kyle Bouerly could do better.....  Naaaaaaah.  Mmmmmmmmmmmm... 12 hours of CS-y goodness.
