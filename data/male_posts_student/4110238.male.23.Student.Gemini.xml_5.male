Before I sat down, that thought passed through my head--then I realized this is a  blog ; it's not about what happens to you.  All that matters is what you say!  Blogging is  performance !  So, that being said, here are today's contributions to the information superhighway (or, as  urlLink Jillian  puts it, the Internerd):  1)  Since the end of summer draws ever nearer, I need to retitle my blog (not because the current title sucks): you can submit your suggestions in the comments section, or  urlLink email  them to me.  Is it lame to come up with titles related to things I've read in books?  2) Talked to Jillian for a while tonight (see link above); disappointed her because I cannot play hooky at work tomorrow and go shop with her in Dallas.  Oh if only I could!  Northpark is definitely a place that makes me happy.  Plus there's the  urlLink Lacoste  store...  3)  Did a really bad thing and bought some cookies tonight...Chips Ahoy!, which I don't even really like.  Bad, bad me!  Then I started to compare myself to other guys, and I said to myself, I says, Tim, just put down those cookies.  Just back away from the cookies.  Just throw the cookies away...  I mean I only weigh 160...maybe I am anorexic (see earlier post)...  (timtheta looks over this post and realizes, man...what is going on in my life that I consider  this  newsworthy?)
