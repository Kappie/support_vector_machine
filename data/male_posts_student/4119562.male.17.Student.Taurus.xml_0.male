Well Ladies and Gents.....last night was awesome, it was like old times. Steph, Bek, Hannah, Jon and I went and ate at panera then saw shrek 2 at the nova 8....the food was good, I had already seen the movie. I'm not a big fan of nova 8, but hey i got to be loud and obnoxious and it was fun.       Despite recent "problems," things have been going great for me. I've got to hang out with old friends and I've been able to make new ones. My senior year is about to start soon and I am ready to graduate. There are other reasons things are going great to.....maybe ill talk about those next week sometime, so keep checking back.      Contrary to popular belief, I am not funny all the time, I do get serious some times. It's awful to have people hang around you and talk to you just so you can amuse them. I am not some monkey. I'd like to think I am a pretty well rounded guy who is fairly intelligent and likes to have fun, but some people are like..."yeah we can have an intelligent conversation.....later....now make me laugh." Hey if you only know the funny side of Kratzer, then you only know half of me. Oh well.....life moves on....      Btw....If you read this reguarly....let me know...leave a comment                There is no defence, against pointed arrogance.  You've got want it, Youve got to want it......                        -Geddy Lee
