In modern society, some consider the first date to be an acceptable time to "go Dutch" - each person paying for their portion. But if you're looking to impress, pull out your cash or the always impressive Platinum card and pay for her. If it seems like she is trying to order the cheapest item on the menu or orders a salad and water, politely let her know that she should order whatever she wants...let her know there are no limitations. Even if it breaks your bank and the date is already outside your budget, if you care, you'll pay for whatever she wants. NOW - if she jumps from water to champagne, dump the gold-digging bitch!
