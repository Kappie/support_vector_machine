At about 3:30ish I went upstairs to take a nap before work. I took a shower at 4:30. Got to work at 5:02.  Work was so boring! Worked the grocery order from 5-7:30. I then took an extended break till just before 8 and faced the store.  It was the after-work stuff I remember. As soon as I arrived I checked my blog to see an interesting comment. At midnite that person came on and we chatted. It seems that he believes that what I have said is impossible. Well I hope to be the first to prove him wrong!!! Wait... well I don't really want that to happen unless... well nvm. Her happiness is the KEY. My purpose is merely to see it happen. A or B... it's all good. But even if A was to happen, thats not 100% happiness either cuz I know that some1 else out there isn't 100% happy. Nothing = 100% happiness. It's just a question of how close u can get. And the closest I will ever get is knowing that she's at the closest she will ever get.  100%... No, but I will be 99.9% from A or B...  And keep striving for your dreams. They're urs if u want it...   Someone else on msn made me realise me fickleness. I promised my heart to the first person who seemed like they might take it. Then again, I always knew that I would do that. I knew that if I ever "loved" someone who "loved" me back then I wouldn't hesitate to commit... Ya, the single life is not for me. Then again, it's all I've ever had, so I dunno any better.  What? Wondering what's wit the "love"? Cuz it's such an abused word, everyone uses it when they dont mean it. That's why I hesitated to use it but did for lack of a better one. Have I ever known love? I dunno... but if this isn't it then I never have... and it seems like I've made it so that after this I never will.   Today (Saturday)  I was SUPPOSED to be at work at 9. Well I woke up at 8:20   Yo, I got time....   **Returns to sleep**   Ah ya... nothing like that extra 5 mins sleep... What time is it?...   **Checks time**   8:50!!!! Head buss....   (Excuse the slang)  Well, I jumped outta bed and took a shower. I was out at 9:10   Meh, I'm late so I might as well take my time   **starts Usher - Confessions**   Woooo.... Usher's too good!   **sings along**   I got to work at 9:22... I said sorry to my manager and he said it was alrite. Then I took out some bread and dropped the top "shell" right on front of him What a way to get more hours huh?? Anyways, after bread, ice, and the sugar my friend came in...  I JUST realised that I forgot to fill the water. My manager is in tmr morning and will notice that too. Wow I struggle...  Well my friend who I go "church hopping" (lol that sounds so nerdy) wit came in as usual. We talked some more and he told me he got the job!!!! YAY!!! But I wont see him at UTSC next year... O well, can't have everything. But I am happy for him!! He told me that he set the bar for his pay so high that he thought it guaranteed that he wouldnt take it. Guess he didn't set it high enough...  There are some decent sales at Dominion this week:  Beatrice OJ - $0.99 - down from $2.19 I think...  McCain Pies - $0.99 - dunno whats the reg price...  NO!!! They are not paying me to say this!! ò.ô.... jks  These are the sales I took advantage of today. I also got hooked up from my bro's friend at McDs... sweet. I spent less than $5 today and got soooo full. As usual I told him what I've been up to lately. He said I was "pimpin it" again and I said "hahaha... no". We're reaching another church tmr. A mainly black dominated "revival" church. (No offense to u black or revivalist or read this... aprrox none)   After falling asleep on my bed I went to run some ball. As soon as I got there some strugglers asked me to play. Wow I was straining, missing open jumpers and such. Then one of urs rolled his ankle (I know how that goes) and some lil kid subbed in. My immediate thoughts was "wow well we lost", but this kid was decent. He even popped a few nice shots. He doubled dribbled and travelled alot but he was still decent for a lil kid. Well finally I popped 2 clutch pull-ups in my man's eye to seal the game.  Then my friend came and the strugglers got scared off. Well not really but they did leave. For a while my friend and I shot around. He told me how I sucked at sc and what i gotta do to get better:  Dl 10 reps of each matchup (3 in total) and study and learn em all, then train for a solid month and u'll be good.  My reaction -----> ô.ô (surprised yet intrigued)  When the court was completely empty my friend knocked over a garbage can and stood on it to fix the mesh the somehow was installed on a rim. He felt bad afterwards for the garbage so he put some of it back.  Hmm... then some1 came by and I fooded em both twice in "Around the World" 3pt style. Some weed smokers / drinkers came by and one of em came on my team to run 2v2. SOMEHOW... we won... but it took some clutch plays on both of our parts, tho I did get shook hard and jayed on...  My friend who was still mad that I won in a shooting game challenged me to Horse. I won there too. Then I lost 2 games of 21 cuz it got dark and my vision just died. I mean the rim turned into a thin black circle against the whiteness of the backboard and the lights. Yes... I am blind.   After ball I got home msned for a bit and took a shower. The rest of the fam got home and ate some good food leaving me to fend for myself. Luckily I got something going in the oven rite now ^.^ Hmm... besides the msn rite now that was my day.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   What?? Oh the title. Well after some serious thinking I realised that this is the promise to end all promises. How?... dont worry.... :P... well cuz Matt, Ada and Martha are gone... that only leaves Will to read this... and I'm sure you know how that makes sense so there's no need to explain.  .................  Ok, well here it is anyways.  My promise from a msn convo:   ... i told her that if it wasnt her then it wouldnt be anybody...    Well there are 2 scenarios:  1. It is her and there is no need to make any promises to anyone else!! ^.^  2. It's not her and a God sent womancomes along. What do I do?   I would keep the promise, as much as I hate to defy God I will not abandon the promise, tho I made it while my emotions were wild and tho she may (what am i saying, of course she will) want me to move on, i cant, cuz a wedding vow is a promise too, no use in breaking a promise to make another rite?    (me from another msn convo)   Yes... no more promises to make for Warren ^.^ What an easy life I've made for myself rite??   Well, Matt's leaving too now, guess it's just me and Will... :(  (no offense Will :P)   So ima miss u 2 Matt. Take care and Have Fun!!!  Warren   [11] [8] [12]  (u figure what's to who...)
