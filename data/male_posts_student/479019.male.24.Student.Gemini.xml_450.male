I've done some jogging in the morning, which I've been able to do since I'm still someone on eastern time. Then I started working again on Tuesday. It's great to see familiar faces and do new things like learn about the new market. I also got to go to a meeting at the Marriott. I also went out drinking Friday night with a bunch of friends in Costa Mesa / Newport. It was cool, because I never really got to check out bars in OC before. Well I got home a little before 4 and then went to work at 9. After a brutal day of work from being tired, I pretty much went straight down to SD with Brandon for a BBQ at Andy's.  So it was a good week. I had a lot of fun.  ****
