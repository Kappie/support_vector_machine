I am no longer the kid that I knew of myself the previous years when I would just be enthusiastic in sharing and serving. It is as though I have come into my very own 'spiritual desert' as many people described.  But thankfully, with an increasing excitement for the Word of God and Christian Literature, it appears that God is leading me back to live in His presence. But a problem I still encounter would be my lack of prayer and the experience. It is as though I am on the excess of the Reformed Movement and the lack of the Charismatic Movement. Not that the other extreme is better, but based on the 'oscillating pendulum' theory, a balance down to a middle in between would be the best and eventually narrowing to the point of accordance with God's plan which would come on the Day, where we would all be perfected in knowledge as well.  "God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.", said Jesus in John 4:24. So may we all be able to worship him with full of spiritual experience and also with clear and sound knowledge concerning the Word of God, worshiping in spirit and truth.
