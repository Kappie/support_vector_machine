School doesn't have that, it just fills me with an empty feeling at the end of the day, which subsides by the next morning in school and only returns at the end of the day when I realize I have to come back.  Okay, fuck that, straight up.   More interesting things.  Tommorow that weird punk concert is (the grammer is based off of my Chemistry saying today "Glue-all-like").  I normally wouldn't go, considering I have two songs that are rock related on my computer (not counting the other 4 limp bizkit songs), but Samone (Monie?) is going so hey camp friend! Maybe I can convince Allie to come as well, so I don't feel like a total geek (even though I may as well be considering half the shit I listen to is rap).  So I guess that I'm looking forward to that, I really wish I could take some pictures, but alas, I'll need to buy a disposable camera, and will that be easy?  I don't know.  Maybe I can barter some money off of mi mama, para que es un problema porque ella me querara trabajar en la casa y  I don't like trabajar en casa.  Robles was talking about that today..... But whatever, I should leave with some deep analysis of my favorite Nag Hammadi Book.  Light and Darkness, life and death, right and left, are brothers of one another. They are inseparable. Because of this neither are the good good, nor evil evil, nor is life life, nor death death. For this reason each one will dissolve into its earliest origin. But those who are exalted above the world are indissoluble, eternal. -Gospel of Philip  This one is equally disturbing and uplifting at the same time and reflects a HUGE portion of "traditional" , if such a word exist, Christian Gnostic thought IMHO.  This essentially, in reference to the fixation most Christians have with dying, reflects how dying doesn't really gain you much.  Heaven and Hell aren't very far apart, and achieving either one of them is no accomplishment if you can become exalted above that.  Why would you want to worry about Life after Death, when you could simply transcend life-and-death?  Essentially, the entire universe is a circle.  Everything exist within the circle, but there is also  something  outside the Universe.  Even more this then ties into the theme of the world we percieve with our five senses to be a complete lie.
