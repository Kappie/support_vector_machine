But it wasn't all bad: I was on express for a while, which was good... Meh.   As soon as I got home, I ate, then jumped on the phone to Kieran. I'm still on the phone to him now. I can't wait till I go down and see him, but SHIT! I am so scared about it.... What if he hates me, or thinks I'm ugly... He says he's not like that, but sometimes he does act like the stuckup populat boy stereotype.  But Meh, I love him to bits and I don't wanna lose him. (heard that before?)
