There is Brock and Elise and Becca and they are frozen in time as they dance at a Violent Femmes concert. Look there immediately or I will smite you to the core of your being immediately for disappointing my fanatical mandates!     This is how you spell power, my fellow mortals. If you lack the Memphis Commercial Appeal, visit the site and look at the article concerning  urlLink Concerts  and feel the utter power of being immortalized in a picture that represents kinetic motion to the max.  I apologize for the extremely random behavior I just engaged in. But it was fun. You must feel the power now. Go and see at gomemphis.com.  Cheers, fellow human beings.
