The luck that your got a flat tire and Mr. Perfect actually pulled over for you. Fate is the fact that you lost your job,  so  it must have been fate, besides you hated that job ,right. Fate is your boss telling you that to stay after work and on the way to your little (piece of shit apt.) you find miss perfect asking you for directions. So you could look at it from any perspective you want, fate and luck are very much alike. I belief in the mere fact that if is going to happen then it will happen,and you can't change it. There was a movie that came out not to long ago that was about brilliant scientist that lost his wife right before his very eyes. So he constructed a Time machine. Every time that he went back to try and save her, she died. Later he realized that he could not save her no matter the what he did. This is fate.                                                    P.S. Thanks "le ducth"                                                   I do believe in fate
