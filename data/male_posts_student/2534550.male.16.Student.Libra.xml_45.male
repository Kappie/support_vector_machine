I woke up kindof angry mainly because I was wakin up by my dear grandpa because I had to take my car to the shop. Im so tired of that car but I love it so much. I think tommorow I'm going to wash my car and wax it just because it hasn't been cleaned in a while....awww *tear realizatiion of the fact that my car will be in the shop until tommorow hopefully I can drive up to my grandma's house to help with preparation for Christmas. But after I rested for a while I decided that I wanted to do something so I busted out the roller coaster tycoon jk actually I did do that, but I also talked to my good friend Leilani and we decided that we both needed to get out of the house and go on a little excursion so it took a little planning on my part so that I could get a car so I borrowed my g-pa's car (not fun too much work old stick w/o power steering) so we decided to go to good old Baskin Robbins 31 flavors were I went in and dominated the ordering because I used to work at Baskin Robbins but after that we sat down and had a long awaited conversation it felt so good talking to her again just because we haven't got to sit and talk for a long time. Then I went over to the chinese food place and my credit card didn't work because the gas station charged 11 dollars when they should've only charged me 6 something so that wasn't a good thing to find out about when your trying to by something. But the good thing is that carma came in and Leilani's little sister Vilma paid for it and it was really cool. I really wish I had enought time for a job because money is sparse nowadays. (wow that was a tangent) but yea all in all it was a very productive day better than some worse than others but I had fun.
