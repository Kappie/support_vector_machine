I also spend a lot of my time on the forums: http://www.suprnovaforums.com where I can be found as kier. Anyway, I have recently been looking around and playing with Photoshop and have made some quite nice banners (in my opinion) here are some of them:  urlLink     urlLink    And my current Suprnovaforum Sig:   If you want a free sig, feel free to email me (djcrazymonkey@gmail.com)or leave a comment. I like to leave with a question, it's like my thing (from now on anyway). So, what do you think of filesharing? Is it good, bad or don't you really care? Something for you to think about. Leave comments on your thoughts.
