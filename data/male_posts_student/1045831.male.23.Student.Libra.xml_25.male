I was supposed to go see Jason Boland and the Stragglers with Toms but the band decided that a little snow on the ground was too extreme for them so they canceled the show.  So instead we got drunk and went to Last Call, which is a new bar and will probably be cool once people start going there..  When  we were going in were were the ony guys in the place other than the bouncers, yet they still question my id (22 fucking yrs old)...  When they have decided I'm old enough they let us in a we just hang out and play a new golf game PGA open or something (Toms like it a lot more than me even though I still beat him by like 2 strokes)..  then we decided to go to the sandbar at like 12:00..  at this point I am pretty drunk..  When we get there they question my id again..  I give them another form then they decide they can't let me in...  They have a scanner and just don't use it..  dumb bastards..  so me and toms go to meet his girl at Brothers..   this saga continues but I gotta run to class real fast and then I will complete the tale...
