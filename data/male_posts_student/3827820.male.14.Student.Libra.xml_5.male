Nothing more than functions, permutations and combinations, this Maths Test covers no more stuff. However, studying and preparing myself well enough to passs these topics is really *phew* tiring!  Yesterday night I spent 2 solid hours just studying Maths with my roomate, but my panic today morning left my brain totally blank! Luckily my rusty brain do rang some bells during the test, so I can have something to fill up the aweful spaces...  Today's assembly is a fun one - our dear principal, Mr Hon has reduced the number of ace points from 20% to 15%, which made us feel more comfortable!  I've been noticing that violent objections and debates around the ACE Point gauging for the year... and at last, everything is settled. So, I can pay more concentration on my ACE Points!  Kenn Siang just bought a new Apple laptop and during the night he accidentally came across a wireless network provider which actually allow blue-tooth users to access the net without any cost!  Hope that ACE Points help me to ACE in my studies!  Cheers, Teddy-O-Ted!  *Tips of the day - Try to recycle more aluminium cans as possible! You know why? Coz by recycling each can, you can help the Earth save up to an amount of electricity which would keep the televisio running for 3 hours!
