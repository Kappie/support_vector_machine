Till i found out what she does. There she is trying to hide this from me. Now i know what i could not see. My heart is falling to pieces. Yet her beauty still shimmers and glicens. I can not bare to except what is. So much pain running through my head. I wish to die and forever rest in bed. But then she has won. Forcing my feelings, i must go on. What we could have shared with eachother. It would have been a relationship like no other. If she could only see. What she will be missing. Someone to truly love her. A person to love her, a person like me...
