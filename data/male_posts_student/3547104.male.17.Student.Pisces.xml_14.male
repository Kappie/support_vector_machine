Haven't seen her in like 3 years or something.... hopefully Kim, Whitney, and I shall be able to spend some time together and film  Arma-get-it-on  (A film we planned but never recorded.) AAAAHHH!!!! I'm still high from our five minute forty-six second conversation. I     Held up so high, on such a breakable thread.....
