They think they are doing people a favor by advocating  against  suicide of their fans.  I think they missed the memo entitled "the problem" and subsiquently skipped that "against" part.  On the plus side, now they're gonna be inundated with letters from 14 year old girls telling them how that song saved their life litterally.  We'll see how they deal with the pressure.
