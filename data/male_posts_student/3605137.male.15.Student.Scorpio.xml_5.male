As for me, I felt my life was miserable and I really hated myself for the past and for what I am .The past is the past no one can change it. It took me hard to accept it .Well if there were a time machine I don't mind going back to the past and change it.. hehehe    Well my advice to you is to look at life in a different view a positive view and enjoy life take care !!  -kev-
