Just because a person dies does not instantly mean that they are or ever were perfect.  You don't respect a person who is an asshole to you, why should you respect him after he dies.  I am not speaking of anyone specific, just in general.  I have been told that you shouldn't walk over dead peoples' graves or yell in cemetaries.  Why?  Do you honestly think the people that are dead are going to care if you are walking on the ground above them?  I don't care.  I went to my grandparents' graves yesterday.  They are buried in Anderson Cemetary.  We were there about eleven-thirty, at night.  We met some nice guys from Chicago, Bethany offered to sleep with one of them in their Mustang.  Anyway,  I'm not saying you shouldn't remember the dead.  Just remember that they were people and they weren't perfect.  Why do some fear dead people?  Most of them were nice elderly folks who would give you candy.  Then they die and suddenly they are someone to be feared.  Even if they did come back as ghosts or spirits why would they want to hurt you?  I know that somewhere in the bible it says that ghosts are sent from the devil but . . . I don't know. . . God can do whatever he wants, he can send ghosts.  Everyone that sees angels says they give you a calming feeling and that ghosts make you cold and uncomfortable.  How the hell are we so sure that the ghosts aren't angels and people just don't believe in them, they fear the unknown.  Why would the devil's ghosts appear to people in churches, the house of God, it doesn't make any sense?  Don't get me wrong, I believe in God, I just think that . . . well, you know, the bible is a book to be interpreted.  We, as humans, have made our fair share of mistakes, let's hope we haven't misinterpreted the Bible too much.  I had no intention of offending anyone, just expressing my opinion.  By the by, if you are going to leave a comment about how I need to "find God and be saved and understand the bible", don't, I know where god is and the church, catholic that is, doesn't believe in being saved and you are full of it if you think that you understand the bible so don't waste my time.  That sounded kind of bitchy, it wasn't the idea I just don't feel like reading it right now.
