I think a contemporary and professional global bussiness should practice more legitimate methods in their trade.  All a terrorist would have to do is create a numbered, anonymous account filled with millions of dollars and their little friends take what is needed.  Thanks to friends like the Saudi royal family and every damn African country, these people have free run to create fear.  I wish the American people would unite, regardless of differences (not unlike post Pearl Harbor) and crush the enemy before they move again.  Time is on their side, not ours!  It is definitely not this administrations, nor the sex-filled admin priors fault for anything happening, they are bound by our own laws protecting the terrorists.  We should seriouslly re-think our form of law, at least for the time being to protect our future.  Yeah, rights will be lost, but they are only "rights" not "lives".  Which is more important to us?  I would gladly suffer any inconvieniences imposed just knowing that those people are feeling the same squeeze, making it harder to do their "jihad"    Fuck your jihad, I'm Rick James bitch!
