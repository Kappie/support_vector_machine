I was trying to buy some more school clothes and stuff but theres no money that I really have to spend.. We'll just see what 40 dollars can get with a 30% discount on clothes already marked 50% on sale..  - I need polo shirts.. and t-shirts.. maybe some of those CRB tee's I saw for 7.96... (sorry, i'm just thinkin out loud.. typing*)  So, I work at 12:30 till 4:30, so i'll prolly find somethin I like and put in on hold till I get back up there at six.. I'll go bug somebody like  LoGan  or  JeSsIcA .. BTW I havent seen  JiLl  in a while.. Anyways.. (It'd be cool if we all went to the movies or somethin.. theyre all pretty cool ppl.. Fun fun.. Besides I need more friends.)  I guess I'll be stayin at my cousins house b/c I have no way of getting to the party otherwise.. (it's starts at 4:30)  No licsencse yet..
