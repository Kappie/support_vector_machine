Also, im awatching the very first rocky, man, what a classic. No wonder its on AMC  . Today was your average day, went to go see if ican go get these custom prescribed (sp?) goggles for my trip to the bahamas. My theory: "Why should i have to walk around squinting the whole damn time, not getting the full enjoyment of things, when i can get goggles, and use them time and time again". Hopefully ti works on my parents.  By today i mean June 16th (its past midnight, but i still consider to day, the day before, get my drift?).  Today today (said it twice because i mean june 17th) im getting my new bike. Haro X1 Backtrail. Yeah, my last bike was a GTI hand-me-down from my older bro. Lasted me for a very long time, but tis rusted and at its worst, hence why the new one.  So, thats that, i will post again later.
