I think I am the only one who tagged (keys doesn't count, he's too short :P). Duncan and Ben are still playing with  urlLink Terragen,  a terrain generator, which takes FOREVER on the school computers. Oh well. Umm. It's Friday, and suprisingly, I didn't see Matt yesterday, so I couldn't scream things almost like "Happy Birthday" at him. But it's Friday, and since it is Friday, I'm not gonna do any work in CAD class. Hey--doesn't that sound like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,  and  Thursday too? I think I may be seeing a pattern here. Ben is going to be a narcileptic now, just to see whether the teacher, Mr Duquette notices. I wonder if he does... Over the past few weeks, I have acquired more and more students from Duquette-san, and I have been teaching them the masterful art of Visual Reality.
