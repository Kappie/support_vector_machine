I had to drive for an hour to get to the theater because only three places in the area were showing the film and the other two were sold out for the weekend (!)  So after about two hours of IMs and phone calls and traffic, I made it to Orchard Park.  There were several interesting notes not involving the film, which include:  --Meeting STEEVIE STEVE for the first time --The jackarse who wouldn't shut up the entire movie (was he the same guy at The Passion?) --The lines to get in (sold out like all the other showings) --The cop stationed next to the ticket-taker --Going to Louie's Red Hots after the show  At Louie's, STEEVIE STEVE got feta cheese for his hot dog.  It was a lot of cheese.  Meanwhile, I concocted that the movie  Super Size Me  accurately shows how John Kerry wants to make us fat.  Burgers at McDonald's most often have ketchup on them, and Heinz is the largest producer of ketchup.  John Kerry is married to an heir of the Heinz family fortune.  Don't you see?  Kerry is an opponent of Bush because Bush is from Texas, the center of the burgeoning salsa industry.  The salsa market is growing phenomenally and directly threatening the Heinz/Kerry family fortune!  There were connections in  Fahrenheit 9/11  that almost seemed that far-fetched, however, it never went that far out.  I would say that not everything in the film was true, but nothing was false.  It was the funniest film I've seen this year, but didn't show me anything I couldn't have gotten from The Daily Show except for a little extra research.  As our buddy Dave said, the movie was propaganda.  Great propaganda.  It didn't have to rely on lies like Goebbels did but simply the humanness of its subjects.  George W. Bush is a moron and I could have told you that in 2000.  Still, there's nothing like seeing him and his administration in all its "nucular" glory.  And that thing that Wolfowitz does with his hair . . . disgusting!
