I mean, I walked into the men's bathroom here at work today and we had "fresh peach"-smelling soap.  Now what guy wants to walk around smelling like "fresh peach?"  C'mon...that's almost as bad as when we only had vanilla-scented shampoo at home (and that was the better of my two options - the other shampoo was frescia :-P).  Give me some Lava soap or something - you know, the kind that just about takes your skin off (especially when I need to wash my hands after checking my oil...).  Saturday was definitely the best day of my weekend.  Mortar Board was helping build a gym-set for a community center in Ravenna, so we headed down there about 9:15.  There were actually a lot of people there to help (about 15 or so, not including our group of about 12), and the guy who was in charge of the build (from the gym-set company) had a Bobcat with an auger (a necessity for this kind of project...I bet he dug 15-20 holes 2 ft. in diameter by 3 feet deep - not something I would have wanted to do by hand!).  Our group was first given the task of putting together the "Power Tower" (or something to that effect) - you know, one of those contraptions with the center pole and the rings around the outside that you can climb.  That took about 2 hours or so - the fun part for me was being able to climb about 12 feet up on this ladder (on uneven ground) to put in the bolts at the top, and finding out after I was done that the ladder was structurally unsound! :-D  Then I got to start doing the stuff that I love to do - straight-up manual labor, i.e. haulin mulch, mixing concrete, pullin boulders out of the ground, etc.  I had almost forgotten how much I love to do that kinds of stuff, especially when it's for a good cause - I swear that if I could do that for a living, I would.  Everyone else in my group left at about 12:30, but I stuck around until 3:30 (in yet another episode of my social alienation, no one had wanted to drive down in my car with me...which was fine with me :-P).  There was a group from Computer Associates there, so I pretty much helped them put together the main set.  It had been pretty warm out all day (although it got a little colder as the day went on), and the mist / rain that had been falling all morning had made things pretty muddy.  I loved it!  Needless to say, if there was anything that we needed to do where someone had to get down in the mud (which actually happened quite a lot), I was the guy...by the end of the day I was so caked in mud and concrete that I was just hoping it didn't mix with the water and dry on my clothes or in my hair :-P  Anyway...when I got home I called up my folks and arranged to go to Hudson's football game.  They were playing in the first round of the playoffs against North Canton, so since Danny is on the team I wanted to go and support them (plus, NC was supposed to be pretty good, so maybe he would get in if Hudson got way behind).  Of course, as usual we were a little late getting out the door; the game started at 7:00 in North Canton, and we were leaving Silver Lake at 6:30 :-P  But at least I got to listent othe end of the OSU game...I just don't know how they manage to make EVERY GAME so close and still win!  So after the OSU game my dad turns to the Hudson game on the radio (of course, the only station we could find with it on had to have the worst North Canton announcers on it...but at least we got to hear Hudson fall behind 21-0 in the first quarter :-P).  So then we get down to North Canton and my mom turns to my dad and says, "Are you going to tell me where to go?" - of course, having not said anything before we (meaning everyone else in the car) had assumed that she knew roughly where she was going!  In the end we ended up getting to the game by about the middle of the 2nd quarter (by which point it was 28-0), getting into the game, and promptly watching just about nothing happen on the field.  The game pretty much went downhill from there; the final score was 49-0 North Canton, and Danny didn't get in.  But I think I might have gotten on TV! (at least the camera was pointed right at me...I swear I probably looked so somber, it was a frustrating game).    Anyway...Sunday was interesting.  Went to church - we had our new Transitions Sunday School class, which was cool, but I didn't know half of the people there!  LOL...Dave (the teacher) asked everyone to try to be consistent about coming, but I already know I won't be there at least 1/2 of the time (between video and parking and nursery).  Ah well...c'est la vie.  Came home from church all rarin' to go with my schoolwork...and promptly got sidetracked.  Four hours later, still hadn't started...and THEN I find out that we have virtually the entire family comin over :-P  Of course, being the relatively anitsocial person that I am, that didn't bother me too much (I still read my "Politics and the American Economy" while everyone was there), but it still would have been nice to have some forewarning! :)
