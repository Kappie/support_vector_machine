This brings to mind the concept of settling, who put such a premium on ambition?  I've oft heard people say to another you could do so much better or that if only they'd be great.  What's wrong with taking what comes, aiming low, contentment, station if you will, if happiness is the only premium.  How many find themselves empty after a lifetime of striving, all the time lost, all it takes is a few pauses.  So worry not, absolve the stress, take solace in your friends, toast to health and to sunshine.  Breath in the air, smell the flowers, cheers to the birds and put one foot in front of another and take whatever comes your way with a smile.
