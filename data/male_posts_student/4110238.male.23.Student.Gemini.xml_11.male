It's what happens when I don't get enough sleep: laughing uncontrollably at things that have little to no humorous value. It's remarkably similar to drunk Tim. It was so bad today the guy I work with, Edward, who hasn't seen me laugh much (let's face it, sheriffs aren't exactly the funniest guys in homeland security), had to ask me if I was OK...at which point I pretended there was some confusion over my assignment. I don't even remember what was so funny...  Tonight was the Ari Hest concert at  urlLink Stubb's . Allyn and Leslie are totally in love with him... You can see pictures  urlLink here  and decide for yourself. Dude is amazingly tall. He only played for about 30 minutes. It was great, but so hot! The venue at Stubb's is outside. There were a lot of people there, to see the act Ari was opening for: some middle aged guys known as the Finn Brothers, who are apparently from New Zealand (counterintuitively: I was hoping for some hot Finnish techno). There were lots of "kiwis" there; who knew there were so many in Austin. I guess it makes sense though...that sort of quasi-hippie vibe is probably pretty strong in both places. More proof that New Zealand is totally a "thing" right now. I swear the ghost of  urlLink Jerry Garcia  was there to check out the show...  Quote of the day* (in two parts):  Allyn: Yeah, that's my favorite job, putting things in my mouth...  Leslie: Yeah one time I got paid $75...  Me: Uncontrollable laughter.  *Like all good quotes, these lines are taken completely out of context.  PS: Leslie told me I have a svelte body! OK, she didn't really say that...but that's what I heard.  Out of nowhere:  *This weekend at my parents I found out I only weigh about 160 lbs (assuming their bathroom scale is right). Does this make me  urlLink anorexic ?  *I need to get tickets to  urlLink Austin City Limits , because apparently everyone I know is going.
