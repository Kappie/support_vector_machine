But fuck it for tonight.  Tonight, I am drunk.  I drove out to Schulenburg, Texas (population 2699), shot some film for my documentary project, came home, took a dirty nap, watched an episode of Cheers, and went out drinking with Denton Heaney and Jennifer Girdish (last line mandated by the two so when you search their names on Google, they get more hits).    I'm moving to California this summer.  Two months.  I don't know where I'm going to live, or what I'm going to do for a living.  I don't know a soul out there.  But shit...I love the coast.  And I love meeting new people.  I am very lucky that I know so many quality people and have so many quality friends.  Maybe I'm selfish in that I want to meet more people and see who else in the world is just good.  A few months of getting tan on a beach, waiting tables, walking in the park, and not being afraid to start a conversation with the hottie in the bar should be great for the writer mired in self-doubt and questioning his ability to write a coherent screenplay.  I'm lucky that I can take the time to do this.  So I'm going to.  Fuck grabass.    If anyone wants to come, you're more than welcome.    Harr is an EXCELLENT powerleveler.
