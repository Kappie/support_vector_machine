Well, for those of you who know (and will probably give me no end to the picking) me and what I'm about, you probably know that this blog will not be updated well nor cared for very much.    Anyway... I'm a gamer, first and foremost...secondly comes non-gaming related computer stuff...then probably skiing....guitar....white water rafting...and the list goes on...  I'm random and head-trippy at times...  I use the (...) a lot!  ...  The bottom line about me is that I love to fix things.  If I'm not working toward fixing something, be it a computer or a person, I'm not really happy.     I'll talk about me for maybe 2 more posts then I'll get into my thoughts and feelings....that is if I have the dedication to keep this up and while the gay-whitesville ping pong nutsack lovers don't bother me about it.   Three words that come to mind when i think of myself (damnit I can already tell this is getting stupid!)  1. Stubborndumbasspainintheass 2. Ladykiller 3. Passionate  if you disagree with those choices.. you can either post a reply to my suckmynuts blog or you can eat me... either way I don't care    Hold it, control it, and BUTTONS! C'mon let's see ya scroll it!   -Steve
