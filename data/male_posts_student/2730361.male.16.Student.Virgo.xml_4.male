While driving back from the local mall we had turned on to the country highway that his house is off of and while we were driving down we happened to see a very large plane very close to the ground. We decided that the plane was likely to crash. So what did we do? We GOT THE HELL OUT OF THERE!! Now when i say a very large plane i am reffering to the fact that it was a Jumbo Jet that means thatit was a Boeng 747 jet or larger. To give you an idea a B747 is about two football fields long with two jet engines on each wing. And when i say close to the ground i mean that it was about ten thousand feet up and dropping rappidly. Now i know ten thousand feet seems like a lot but not when the plane was probbably dropping at about 600 feet a second(that is amazingly fast) we were lucky enough that the pilot of said plane must be a genius when it comes to well piloting planes because they were able to recover and fly off while slowly climbing. To emphasize how unusual this is we live in Middle of Nowhere USA there is not an airport that can support a Boeing 747 for at least 40 to 50 miles. This experience has given me more than enough excitment for the next couple of weeks.
