Sorting between the one-hit-wonder trolls, the Christian Fundamentalists with IQ's that would make an Irish Setter look intelligent and then there are those of us who hang around, add a some-what valid contribution and see juvinile some behave when they have a poster who is mature enough not to sound like a 14 year old.
