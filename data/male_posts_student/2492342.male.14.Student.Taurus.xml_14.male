I mean, he was a horrible person who's gonna rot in hell for what he did to us(iran), but he was the only hope for the middle east, in a time when the US is controlling more and more of our lives. so yeah, its sad that they captured one of two epople who dare oppose the US, cause the crappy arab leaders kiss americas ass.  anyways. Bertha brought some girl from LA that I knew long ago..She's hispanic so she cant be that bad. Umm..i havent seen ehr yet, she sin shower..and i need to change and take shower..i dont wanna look like crap when i meet her. Oi...
