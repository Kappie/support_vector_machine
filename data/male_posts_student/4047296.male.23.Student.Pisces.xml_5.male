Because that is what i am. But Low is bringing back down. Down, down, down. Relaxation. Count to ten backwards. I have always thought that God is pleased with music. I often wonder if music, when played from the heart, out of humbleness, can be perfect. Perfect in the sight of God. Like its the one remaining perfect thing left after the fall. And God is pleased. He smiles and listens. Do you ever get shivers up your spine when your praying? Those goosebumps that come when youre humbled and focused on Him alone. Like youre touching God's face. Ever notice that music can do the same thing? Brilliant.  I am happy right now. Homework done, got Low, got nothin but love, got net. And imagine this...i dont have much to say. (Read what Mark A says in the previous post about that.) I would like to say that i was privileged enough to play my drum with Kate V and Case M the other night.  If either of you are reading this...thankyou much for letting me play.  I think i touched God's feet a few times then. I love playing with them. Kate is amazing. Case is too, but ive known that a long time. But the other night, when i was playing with Kate, it was like we were on an abandoned island, just playing. No hurry, no pride. Just music. There was nothing but the music flowing. It felt like i could have played forever, and i think God was pleased. It was all emotion. Our hearts were playing. Thats one thing about music that words lack at times. I cant always express myself with words, but with music, it works. One can dance with music, with words its hard to dance. One can close their eyes with music, you cant very well close your eyes when reading. And if you do, you use your ears. With music, there are only ears. I used to ask people the question: "If you had to choose to be blind or deaf, which would it be." Ive always said blind. Most everyone says deaf. Frankly, i dont know what their problem is. I guess they dont remember when Jesus says, "if your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out" Never once did He mention jabbing out your ears. *Thought: A good t-shirt would be, "Only fools jab out their ears"* I would wear it.  I'm glancing at a picture i have posted on my wall. It appears that it was taken from a helicopter. Its a picture of two men, on top of a snow covered mountain. It looks to be about 20 degrees where they are, yet, they are mooning the sky. My good friend Nick Sh. Gave it to me. What a pal. Its funny, because when ever i see it amongst the hundreds of other pictures scattered about my walls, i am always sent deep into thought. My thoughts now? Its time for bed, i have a big day tomorrow...And im looking forward to brushing my teeth.  Blessings and Peace
