Apparentally it's supposed to pull my jaw up, but all it's doing is pulling my fangs out.  Now I know how Dan feels.  Anyway, I reinstalled Half-Life and have been playing Natural Selection. Not that any of you would care, I just thought that I'd point that out.  I'm supposed to Mow the lawn, clean my room, AND do 2 hours of driving stuff today. I doubt that'll be able to happen.  This is so retarted...
