I love my bacon.  It is quite amazing.  My book bag also cheered me up.  You see, there is nothing in it due to the lack of school days that is slowly creeping up upon us.  It was a good thing it was almost empty because Shane had previously locked it to a desk and I had to cut a strap off to free it.  As I am still a little sore from previous events, whether they are physical or emotional, I played my depressing music to get me motivated for the day.  Let's just say it helps to calm me down and make me my sweet and sexy self.  Finally, I made it to my bus stop.  This cheered me up significantly because Lomas was dressed like an Amish person.  It was quite amazing.  He had everything from tight pants to the straw hat.  He's a pretty cool guy.  Chemistry:   Chemistry was surprisingly fun today.  That was probably because it was the last day though, except for my final tomorrow (yikes!).  We got to do a crossword puzzle which was fun because it had a clue and you had to match it to the person in the class.  I didn't finish it, but I was amused to say the least.  The only other entertainment that I had was cutting the rest of my book bag strap off and using it for a whip.  It was cynical yet slightly pathetic at the same time.  Gym:   Gym depressed me.  We had to get dressed, but it was the last day.  Give us a break for Gods sake!  We did have one option however.  We could either play kickball or walk the track.  What went through my mind was this: I'm damn lazy and I'm to screwed up to be active right now so I'm going to be a lazy bastard and walk in circles, but first I'll climb a tree.  The tree climb was amazing, but I scraped my arms so it looks like I'm a cutter.  Oh well.  Walking the track turned out to be fun though.  I hung out with Boon and we made fun of people.  We even picked up a piece of wood and made people limbo so that we could be entertained.  Then Boon got tired of walking and went to play kickball.  That bastard.  I will get him.  Then he came back to me, they always come back.  After forty-five minutes, I was allowed to go inside.  That's when the horror came.  I had to clean out my wrestling stuff, Bill's wrestling stuff and my gym stuff.  Let me tell you something about my gym stuff.  I donâ€™t wash my clothes.  I bring in new clothes to replace the old so I had accumulated quite a bit of smelly clothes.  I finally got everything packed up into my book bag (previously empty), my wrestling bag and Bill's wrestling bag.  It weighted me down considerably.  As I tried to escape the wrestling room, my coach caught me and weighted me in.  I'm surprised he didn't hurt me since I gained ten pounds since the season ended.  Oh I'm sorry, wrestling season is never over.  Java:   Java was boring today.  All I did was read out serial numbers so that Daub could take inventory.  It truly sucked.  I am pissed though because Daub called the tech guys and had a lot of our game sites blocked out.  I can get around firewalls, but that leads to suspension and effort.  Neither of which I want.  Spanish:   I don't want to talk about Spanish because I hate it and it should die.  It should die........................  Math:   I love my math class.  It's so easy and fun.  Shane should us the movie that consisted of him, Hassan, and four cartons of eggs.  I enjoyed it immensely.  My teacher gave me a seashell which I will tell you about later.  It was for good luck.  Social Studies:   I hate Ms. Williams and she is a horrible teacher.  My grade is going to suck because of her poor teaching methods.  Today we reviewed for the final.  It included questions about rappers.  How in the fuck does that help me with remembering facts about Japan?  I wish I was never transferred to her class.  She should get fired.  Cisco:   I have been a captain for jeopardy every time this year, but she wouldn't let me today.  It was the mega-jeopardy!  How could she?  It ruined the game for me and everyone else.  We lost by over a thousand points because my captain is a dumbass.  Grrrrr!  I am going to fail that final.  English:   English is by far my favorite class.  The teacher is amazing and I really enjoy it.  Today I won a crazy award for like ten different things.  Shane and I are quite the trouble makers in that class.  In fact, he even showed his egg footage again.  It was good.  After School:   I went home and ate until I was completely full.  Then I studied for chemistry and math so that I don't fail them.  I was interrupted, however, by Bill and Joe who were at my door.  We ate pizza, played on the trampoline, and then went to Joe's house.  Joe's House:   Pool time fun.  I had a lot of fun throwing people into the pool, having water balloon fights and playing Frisbee.  Top hole mate.   Aside:   I still like her so much, but there's nothing that I can do about it.  She doesn't feel the same way and I really want her in my life.  I want to be a friend of course, but I can't help but want so much more.  All I can do is wait.......................................
