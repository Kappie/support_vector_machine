Factor in that I have been playing  urlLink Max Payne 1  2 , in which good things like falling in love is made bad and the bad things made, well...worse, it’s a wonder why I’m so hyped up.  One of the major reasons is, of course, that  urlLink Matrix Revolutions  opens in less than  urlLink 22 hours  and counting. Finally the best movie trilogy to come around since  urlLink Star Wars  comes to an end. And I’m pretty sure that The Matrix will have the same impact on future methods of storytelling and on pop culture that it had.  Other factors include, the shiny new floor of my room. No more decayed looking carpet and thus much more travel when rolling from end to end in my chair. It also helps to improve the acoustics of the room and as a sound guy, that’s something I can appreciate.  I have also recently finished a   short story  , my first one in years. It’s been a really long time since I’ve written anything but it kinda came to me one night last week. After much prodding from some friends in  urlLink Second Life , I finished it in very short order. Right now, I’m looking into adding a page to this blog to host it, so look for it when it’s officially up.   All in all I have to say it’s been a pretty good week. Just wish I didn’t have two tests waiting in the wings of next week, otherwise I could start another short story, poem or fictional story universe. The writting bug seems to have bitten. At least I don’t have to worry about my reservist call up, I got everything already packed anyway.
