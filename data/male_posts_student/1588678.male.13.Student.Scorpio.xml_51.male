That's why I've been a long time listener of Live 105. They play all rock n roll stuff, so I can easily say I like them.  Here's my story. In the past couple of years, as rap and newer rock bands came to be the radio stations changed, including Live 105. Last year, they really crapped out on me. They played bands like Blink 182 and Good Charlotte, regularly. That’s what really pissed me off. But, then, a miracle happened. This year the owner of Live 105 said that last year, 2003, they experimented by playing newer stuff. And they realized that there was less listeners. So he decided that Live 105 should go back to the roots of rock n roll by playing classic alternative and punk stuff like Nirvana and Social Distortion. I was like, “Right on!!!” I mean, they’ll be playing The Ramones on my way to guitar lessons. How cool is that?  And this is cool. This morning, I was listening to Howard Stern on Live 105. Around 10 A.M. when it was over they started playing music. The first couple of songs they played ruled! They were playing stuff like Nirvana’s “All Apologies,” Verve Pipe’s “Bittersweet Symphony,” and even Temple of the Dog’s “Hunger Strike.” How friggin’ cool is that?!   I gotta tell ya, Live 105 has changed. And this time, change is GOOD, VERRY GOOD! Well, if you live in the Bay Area listen to Live 105 if you like the same music as I do. Especially if you hate all those crappy bands. Thank YOU Live 105 for realizing how much better you’re doing now that you play to good stuff.
