Granted, I'm  not , but that's a minor detail.  So I'm done, taking a five minute break before I dive into another funfilled hour or two of work.  Today I did nothing but work. This may not seem unusual, but this is me. I woke up at 12, and worked essentially nonstop on my paper for 10 hours. And I feel strangely non-exhausted and ready to move on to my math homework, followed by an unspecified amount of time studying for my kanji quiz.  I think I'm broken. In a good way. Like, since when was I まじめ？  Whatever.
