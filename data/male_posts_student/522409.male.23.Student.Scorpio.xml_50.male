The pain is like this undercurrent that almost sustains me... it's as though it was the energy that keeps me going.  I'm exaggerating a bit.  The pain has sort of subsided on the issue I'm referring to... just every once in a while I flirt with the possibility of going back to the same old situation... it's like the movie  The Shawshank Redemption  and how they characterize the people who get out of jail after spending decades in it.  They are afraid to live outside those walls, outside their security blanket.  Well, for a long time now, that fear and pain and insecurity has  been  my security blanket, and I feel a bit like those freed men who wonder in their freedom whether they're better off where they were in the first place.  So much is going well right now, including this girl I'm sorta getting to know.  I worry that maybe the fear of trying something new (i.e. non-painful and reciprocated) might be causing me to subconsciously sabotage it.  That sounds familiar.  I think maybe I've done that once or thrice.  This girl, she's adorable.  If adorable were a person, adorable would be this girl.  She's just the sweetest person ever.  And she has the greatest away messages and profiles.  And the same two favorite books as me.  Crazy.  And then there's the other girl... who just doesn't go away.  It's not her fault she doesn't go away, it's mine.  Hell, I wonder if she even knows she's back.  I wonder if I'll make her stay around or let her go.  I guess I wonder a lot of stuff.  The new Hyannis disc is ridiculous.  Ri.  Dic.  U.  Lous.  I can't even describe it.  It's just some of the nastiest stuff I've ever heard.  24 days.  Lord help me.  So much is happening between now and then.  I hope I make it through relatively unscathed.
