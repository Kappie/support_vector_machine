Al Gore isn't really worth talking about, he's just gone off into another planet, the Michael M. Franken planet. Al Gore is like your little pesky brother that won't go away even though he loses at everything and then goes crazy in front of your parents. Some statements in his wacked off tirade.  "They dare not admit the truth lest they look like complete fools for launching our country into a reckless, discretionary war against a nation that posed no immediate threat to us whatsoever,"   "So when the bipartisan 9/11 commission issued its report finding 'no credible evidence' of an Iraq-al-Qaida connection, it should not have come as a surprise. It should not have caught the White House off guard."  Accused Bush of abusing his presidential powers by invading Iraq without a war declaration from Congress, allowing Americans deemed "unlawful enemy combatants" to be held without being charges, and authorizing "what plainly amounts to the torture of prisoners."   I liked this line by the AP....  Still popular among Democrats , Gore is an important ally for Kerry because he  can criticize Bush in harsher terms than Kerry , this year's Democratic presidential candidate. Aides said  Kerry must temper his critiques of Bush to avoid alienating the independent and swing voters who will influence the outcome on Nov. 2
