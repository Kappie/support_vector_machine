Went to the Troiano's...that's my cousin's last name. We did stuff. You know, stuff. Watched Family Guy. And when Jenna's boyfriend came over he brought his tape of him and some other dude in a Jazz Ensemble drum-off and Matt owned the other kid. It was cool. Gets me psyched for next year if I ever compete in a drum-off. Jazz Ensemble I shall do next year. So, uh...what else. That's basically it for the Father's Day. Oh, my dad got a cooler. I forgot what happened yesterday. I don't remember much. Well I'm sick of the news always having shit about the hostages. Oh man, I'm sick of these towel covered bastards, why doesn't America stop being so cuddly and nice, find those mother fucking pussies, and torture them all to death and tape it and show everyone. I mean, what's with the covered faces, they're the biggest pussies ever, they can't show their faces to America. I mean if we're there in Iraq, for godsake do it for a better cause, stop bombing innocent towns and go find some of those hostage holding pussy inbred son of a bitch monkey sucking ball tapping bastards and kill em.......did I say ball tapping?
