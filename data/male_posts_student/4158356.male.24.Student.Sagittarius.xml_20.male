Knight Shyamalan's  urlLink "The Village" . I was tired from finals and so on and I fell asleep about halfway through the show - Raymond and Tomoko seemed very freaked out afterwards and there were lots of screams from the audience so it must have been pretty good. :)   urlLink    Raymond and the food of the gods ("Guay-Teaw Pad Kee Mao" or the "Drunken Noodles")... notice the insane amount of red pepper!  urlLink                   urlLink    We also got the food... soooo good!  urlLink      urlLink    Close-up  urlLink      urlLink    At the movies... sorry the pic is a bit blurry it was kinda dark...  urlLink
