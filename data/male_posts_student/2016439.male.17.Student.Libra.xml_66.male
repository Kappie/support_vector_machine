Crappy servers.  They suck.  I don't know, today's just been a really blah day.  In fact, the only period I can say I was really happy in was newspaper, but I'm always happy in there.  Every other period and part of the day was the pits.  Sometimes I just get these bouts of semi-depression for no reason, so I just chalk it up to hormones.  I can't wait to put these teenage years and emotions behind me, hehe; after all, it's only a matter of a couple of years now.  It's crazy sometimes to think that in a little over two years from now, I will have hit my twenties (Big Guy willing), but that in itself is exciting.  To have lived for two full decades!  Haha, compared to those lived by my parents and grandparents, I've still got a ways to go and live.  Wait, what am I saying?  I have many stupid projects due this week: memory work due in English tomorrow (guess I should whip out the book to find out what I'm even supposed to be reading), an extra credit project in English due Wednesday, a major BCIS project due Wednesday, and a history extra credit project due Thursday.  Throw on top of that making up two quizzes in Spanish from last week, a math quiz, and taking two math tests by Thursday, and you begin to see just how much this week sucks.  Wow, and I thought the end of the year was supposed to be a happy, stress-free time of year.  So much for that.  P.S.  I'm just glad prom's over.  I don't think I could've taken it much longer.  I didn't go, and to some degree I'm glad, but...I don't know, there's just a lot of bad feelings associated with that right now.  Where'd that come from?
