[Why didn't Jonah post it?-Marten]   The Squid3188:  I'm going to copy and paste a story I just told Marten cause it's funny The Squid3188: I heard these two black guys talking in the bathroom today The Squid3188: and the first one was taking allergy pills The Squid3188: the second was said"man, whatcha takin' those for?" The Squid3188: and he was like, "Allergies, man" The Squid3188: "Well, what you allergic too?" The Squid3188: "Grass and Weeds" The Squid3188: "Man, how you gonna be allergic to weed?" The Squid3188: "Not marijuana, man.  Dandelions and shit" The Squid3188: "Oh.  I feel you, man.  I feel you"  Okay, even though this thought completely warrants a new post, I'm going to splice it in here. I saw something that almost sent me in a seizure right in the middle of the commons. Something so terrifying and evil that I almost screamed when I saw it.   Mrs. Howard was at LC.  I don't know why.  [incoming freshmen-Marten] I don't know how. [she can drive-Marten]  All I know is that she was there, and she scared the hell out of me. The Betty-one looks drowsy!
