Well today was another day of Tyke playing with himself (yeah, he meant for it to sound dirty even though in reality there is no reason for it to sound dirty cuz it wasn't dirty).  He did nothing with nobody.  It was pleasing to just sit and watch the silent snow settle on the bountiful landscape.  It just assuages the wishful moods that are muddled in Tyke's tormenting mood.  Whatever.  Actually it makes him more pensive so it has an adverse effect on him.  But for some odd reason he likes to torture himself on these topics.  Yeesh, this isn't a great start for tonight's blog.  He is hoping to actually be able to post this blog before the clock strikes midnight.  By the way, Amed is gay because he won't let Tyke see when he is typing which would make their conversations easier.  So Tyke just had to let everyone know that Amed is stubborn.  Anyway it was cold today as everyone knows.  Still very cold.  In the low to mid 20s right now.  It is fun to play in the snow but Tyke hasn't done that for years really.  He used to make jumps at his old house in the huge backyard they had and he and his brother would have a blast spending hours just getting air and then crashing into the woods and hurting themselves.  The days used to be so much simpler back then.  Tyke seems to recall already saying this in a previous blog but they really were.  He could have fun easier.  Now he is too obsessed with the opposite sex and his desires (not sexual) regarding them.  But as is life.  And at times life is a bitch.  But for the most part life is something that you cannot get caught up taking too seriously.  Just live life as it comes and have fun.  Don't always take shortcuts either.  Sometimes you need to get dirty and pave yourself a new route.  But other times just stick on the road you are on.  Let yourself be the best judge.  Heed others advice but don't get bogged down in it.  Tyke sometimes heeds the advice of other too much.  He doesn't let himself pick his own path, fearful of mistakes.  That is why he was so proud of himself for telling her how he felt.  It was an accomplishment that he can't overlook.  But also, he feels it most important that you don't overlook your friends who have helped make you the person you are now.  That is so very important.  Because friends will not always stay friends.  People change.  People will get angry and not feel the same about you forever.  Keep your friends close.  Don't let a new person in your life become too much of your life.  Because this person hasn't been there for you your whole life.  Now Tyke feels that he must not be a hypocrite and if he is given the chance to be one he must not crumble and fall like so many before him.  Stay strong and stand tall.  Oh yeah, and Britney got married.  First Jessica Simpson, now Britney!  Who's next?!?!?!  Could it be HER?!?!?!?!  Nah, not unless Tyke is the one.  But oh yeah, another thing.  Tyke has realized that hope is not all its cracked up to be.  Sure hope can occasionally be great.  But in most cases in Tyke's life it just causes immense pain and torment.  It is the cause of great evils.  Hope keeps dreams just what they are...dreams.  In order for dreams to become a reality, action needs to be taken.  So remember, action over hope.  Bye.  Damn, didn't get it done before midnight.
