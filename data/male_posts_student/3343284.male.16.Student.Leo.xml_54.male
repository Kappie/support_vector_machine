     
      i went out to Marine Bay at abt 2:52pm and was suppose to meet my fellow classmates at Marina Bay MRT Control Station @ 4:00pm sharp... but... i over-estimated the time (i estimated tat the ride from Yishun to Marina Bay would take abt 45 mins to 1 hour but in the end... the ride was onli 40 mins long...) and was there since 3:30pm (a 30-mins long long wait... :x )  luckily i didn't hafta wait for long b4 my classmate starts arriving by groups... den finally we set off 20 mins late off our schedule time...  took a bus to get there... den after choosing over some restaurants to eat at... we managed to settle at one...  the price range was this:  -Adult $12 -Children $5  there was live crabs and prawns but i'm allergic to both of these so i nv eat a single one of them...  den our OGLs starts to come... PK arrive at around 6:00pm plus followed by Gary... he came at 7:45pm after everyone cannot tahan the food liao...  oh yeah i forgot abt it liao...  we also celebrated Michelle's b'day... (her nick's in IRC is dRaGoNLuV...)  den i and soon poh head to superbowl for 2 rounds of bowling... the 1st round was a joke... since i always took the 1st round as warm-ups so i did only a 99 for the 1st round... den 2nd round is back to my former self... 142... i thought my 1st round i lose form sia... but got a double at the 10th frame so i could get 99...  den we all play a round of pool... for $2... which continues on and on and on... qiqi, xiao qin and bobby are quite skill in their pool... but i'm more inclined towards bowling so i always lose to the three of them (btw... my victory over bobby was sheer luck... he wanted to hook the ball but it hit the black ( 8 ) ball and it went in... otherwise i was trailing him for like 4 balls...)  after that we went home...  !!! HOME SWEET HOME !!!  okay tat all of my updates... i too tired to type anymore... so...  i'll think of something else to write later after i finished watching Euro 2004 Semi-Final 2: Greece (Surprise !!!) versus Czech Republic...  my personal opinion is tat Czech will win this one... but den again... if Greece managed to snuff our their numerous attacks and could score via counter-attacking... den compact their defenses... den Greece will win...  (my guess: Greece 2 - 3 Czech Republic)  but i'm against soccer betting so i nv bet for this nor other matches...  cya...
