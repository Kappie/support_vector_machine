They articulate feelings and information for people who do  not have these kinds of communication skills. If you can  think, you can hear your voice. If you can hear your  voice, you can write. Writing is a simple extension of  your mind to your fingers.   Do this exercise:  Open a blank page in your word processing program. Let  your fingers hover just above the keys of your keyboard  and close your eyes. Now clear you mind and let it fill  with silence. Into that silence, let your thoughts begin  to focus on what you instinctively know you can do well.  Things you excel at. As each thought rises, type it.  Baking, stained glass, gardening, restoring classic cars~ write until the well runs dry.   Now open your eyes. Like magic, before your eyes, here is  a list of topics for potential ebooks!  There is no price that can be placed on your unique  knowledge and experience. The trick is to draw from the  well of that knowledge and use it to create an ebook.  Internet businesses are hungry for information about how  to turn their websites into profit-making machines.  Whenever an entrepreneur first starts a business, he or  she lacks the patina of experience that comes from many  years of working in the trenches. If your ebook can help  rocket them forward in time by providing them with your  invaluable business know-how, you've got a topic for a  beneficial and successful ebook.  Ebooks are one of the most powerful marketing tools  available in the world today. They can be sent out as  attachments in emails, offered for free or for a fee on  your website, or sent out on discs through the mail. They  can be marketed by your affiliates through links on their  sites and in your ebook. You can offer your ebook through  an autoresponder, thereby capturing email addresses and  building a list of potential customers. Or you can use  your ebook to build an opt-in email list ~ by sending  email only to people who want it, you differentiate your  messages from spam and increase the value of your list.   The ebook format is one of the most versatile on the  Internet. You can use it to create brochures, newsletters,  courses offering advice and information about your goods  or services, training tools ~ all for a profit. Using  ebooks correctly and with business savvy will direct  quality traffic to your website and generate potential  sales. Ebooks can educate your visitors about your  products or services, and teach them about new procedures  or techniques. You can use free ebooks to reward visitors  for filling out a customer survey, which in turn gives you  invaluable insight into customer motivation and habits.  Giving away your ebooks for free helps to build solid  business relationships and keep your customers coming back  to your website. Ebooks will help build your reputation as  an expert in your field and make your business a known  commodity.   If you want to write about Internet Marketing, you will  find a mountain of ebooks about this subject. You must go  through them and locate what is missing. You can market  ANYTHING on the Internet. What about a book about  marketing a business that trains bloodhounds as search and  rescue dogs? Or a book about marketing a business that  grows organic herbs and mushrooms? Figure out what you're  passions are and then turn them into ebooks!   Ebooks are a road to personal fulfillment and financial  success. They are fairly simple to produce and the cost is  minimal. Your ebook not only has the potential to create  profits, but it may very well transform you into a  celebrity. In turn, your value increases along with your  profits. Like a tree lush with leaves, your ebook will fly  across cyberspace, shedding its seeds of knowledge. And  those seed will bear the fruit of new clients and  opportunities for many years to come.
