One year, he and I would stay up late, smoke cigarettes in the Cline openway area, talk about whatever there was going on in the ether, and just enjoy the way the other person turned a sentence, or made a movement.  We were such good friends that we decided to room together the next year.    Our close proximety was probably an issue, as I do a poor job of keeping my space clean, but Nick's not known as a neat freak by any means.  We still hung out, albeit now we were sharing space, and I'm sure there was bitching done by me regarding him, and likewise...friendship does not equate roommates.    And it wasn't one day...everyone wants an example, a specific...but they're so rare to find...something will happen, and you won't like it, but you don't think much of it, because hey, it's something small, who cares about this...but the small things just keep happening, and you start to notice them more and more, but you still don't pay too much attention because they're nothing big, and you can't really get upset about something small.  But now you are, because they've kept happening, the small thing you didn't like before and now you can't stand, but you still can't put your finger on it unless you really concentrate.    And then there's nothing you can really do if you're the person who is doing the thing wrong.  Now your foible is part of your makeup to this other person, one can't exist without the other, and rather than enjoying friendship, you experience saturated awkwardness, dangling barbs, and as much avoidance as possible.    When I first met her, I had no problem with her.  She was energetic, that was cool.  Pretty young, yes, but you can't condemn someone for age.  There was an excitement about her; she was interested in doing things, seeing things, being a part of what is out there.  And that thirst for world exposure is a great attribute.    And an attribute that I no longer see.  Unreqited exeuberence is replaced by a requirement of situation control, and a lofty cynicism for things she does not enjoy.  The energy is still there, now a tool of agitation rather than a device for accomplishment.  Fun comes at an expense, usually at someone else's, often someone that she doesn't know, sometimes not.  And I'm more bothered when the whimsy comes at a random stranger's expense rather than mine.    She wants to be her boyfriend, who is one of the coolest people I know.  But she's not.  And what she picks up from him and uses as her own are some of his lesser attributes, commodified and mass-produced in her overbearing actions.  She doesn't know who she is, but she sure thinks she does.  And whether it's who she is, or who she thinks she is, I would rather not spend time with either.    I would like to take the blame.  My conscious acknowledgement of dislike came about after a lunch date, where we walked to my car, and she and the beau made fun of several fat people trying to squeeze by us into their car.  I thought it too, but I didn't say it, probalby because the windows were down and they were right there, and maybe because I didn't find it appropriate there.  But they bellowed their amusement with the overweight car jockeys attempting to circumvent my Civic and gain access to theirs, within feet of the situation.  And the pompous regality that they spoke with, taking pleasure in the misfortune of these folks...  I forgave him immediately.  That's easy to do; the friendship is strong, and I know his strengths well, so the weaknesses are easy to forget.  But her...I can't.  I don't know her.  And I really don't care to get to know her now.  I'm sure she's a fine person in her own regard...good for her.  I've lost the interest to invest.    --  Music sounds contrived right now.  I'm picking out the choices made, the basic interludes, the flippant structure employed.  This requires a switch from the hard rock I playlisted into classical, a synergy just as abused but not as known to me.    I'm in a shitty mood.  Funny.  Yesterday was glorious for so long, and the days prior just as much...this was a great week, albeit with less work done than I had hoped for.  It's what makes life envigorating, that the minutae can take over instances and render you complete to their outcomes.  Anxiety turns into enjoyment, and then excitement, and euphoria, and the feeling of being on the perch, overlooking the metropolis of feelings that lead to exaltation, only lasts until you somehow, against your volition, fall from your place, and begin downwards before you dig in and start the climb again.  You don't get it all.  And it'd be no fun if you did.
