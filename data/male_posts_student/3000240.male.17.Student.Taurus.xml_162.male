Anyway the day has been quite alright as days go, and as far as days go in the last couple of weeks, its weather refuses to deteorate.  According to Mother and Father, I can being a friend along at new years to  NEW YORK  damnit! I should love to bring Anna or IAN! Yes Ian and myself kicking the yanks arse would be a site to behold.  Anyway that's it as far as today went.  Tomorrow I'm of to the movies with Megan and to get this top I've wanted for ages (God if I don't sound gay there, then I never will *sigh*) - should be fun. xBuBzx
