ACL Music Festival...should've bought tickets months ago when they were just $50 for the duration, but $70 to see these shows is great as well...and I'll get some tannage going on most likely.  Who am I going to see?    Liz Phair - Friday 3-4 The Mavericks - Friday 5-6 Steve Winwood - Friday 7-8 Al Green - Friday 8:45 - 10 Endochine - Saturday 1:45 - 2:30 Los Lobos - Saturday 3-4 Abra Moore - Saturday 6:30 - 7:15 Lucinda Williams - Sunday 2:30 - 3:30 Yo La Tengo - Sunday 4:30 - 5:30 Ween - Sunday 6:30 - 7:30 REM - Sunday 8:30 - 10  NOTES:  I could trade Al Green with Dwight Yoakam no problem, much relating to an Al Green concert I attended at the Del Mar Fairgrounds in San Diego about eight or nine years ago.  Nothing against Al, but it seems like most of his songs were decent covers of other artists.  And at a festival like this, you never know if he'll break out the love ballads outside of  Let's Stay Together .  I could probably miss all of Saturday and not be too upset...Los Lobos are fun, and Endochine is critically-acclaimed, but it's got none of the draw power that Friday or Sunday do.  Phair, Mavericks,  Winwood on Friday, Williams...Tengo, Ween, and REM on Sunday?    Robert Earl Keen is left out, trumped by Liz and Winwood...Steve Winwood is one of my favorite musicians (though his new album isn't too hot, IMHO), and Liz Phair is super hot.  Kind of sad not to see Lyle Lovett making an appearance.    You're welcome to try to convince me to go to  urlLink other good musicians , but make a strong and valid argument.  And don't even bother telling me to go see Spoon or Ben Harper...I'm just not interested.     ADD - Rainer Maria, a famed Indie/Emo band, is coming to Emo's on September 24.  And I've already got plans to see Guster on October 18th at Stubb's.  Woot!
