LoL! i dunno-but i can't continue eating like this..it will backfire, so i started my diet again today! yes, i know....20 carbs a day is like death. i was going to stay with my g-ma this weekend, but i decided not to, b/c my step g-pa was going to be home...and i dont really like him lately! plus, i couldnt if i wanted to, b/c i have a hair appointment @ 4, and she gets off work @ 3:30 (in san ramon), and she already hits all the silicon valley traffic, so i just told her another time would do. we were going to plan my senior trip. ive decided to only invite 2 other people, and i already have (tim and nicole). it should a be a lot of fun if both of them go..even if just one of them can go, im sure ill have just as much fun! so, my g-ma was kinda "iffy" about the whole maui for 10 days trip...but i told her that's what i wanted. she really wants us to go on the cruise to the mexican riviera for 9 days though (goes to cabo san lucas, acapulco, and some other places), OR fly to the Victorian Island in Canada and stay there for 10 days..its near alaksa, so there's lots of whales and glaciers..but i wanna have fun (hehe)! so, its either the cruise or maui..and they're both going to be about the same price, so ill be happy (but i really want maui hehe)! then, im planning a trip to cancuun for spring break next year! i dunno how im gonna pay for it (dad will prob just kick down the scrills), but if i go---OMG its gonna be really fun! so...thats my life right now, just planning. ive gotta get the tickets for my senior trip by the end of july though--cruises are booked so bad right now, and it would prob be easier to go to maui anywayz. then, like i said, ive gotta decide if i want to go to the Republican State Party Convention on August 2nd and 3rd in San Diego--another trip that seems like fun (and i would fly--thank God)....then, i have to decide TODAY if i want to go to Denver for the weekend in July. as you all remember, i wanted Maui, but they were booked to the fullest...so, Denver?? i dunno--kinda stupid out there. soooo im really obsessed with this CD that Tim burned me! LoL! nicole is obsessed with hers too! she's even asking for more..im gonna miss her this week ("blow up doll compliments of stephanie tabor"--you've been replaced nicole! LoL!)...its got all these cool songs, and its all ive been listening to! its really cool. dunno what im doing this weekend. dad's going away to our other house tomorrow morning, and i dunno if gabriel or simon is gonna go with him, but reguardless--im gonna have some fun! not sitting @ home hehe! but since i dont have my cell for a while, i have no one's number AHH! ill live. tim will be there LoL! jk hehe but yeah. ive gotta run though, haircut appointment in about an hour...."gotta make myself look good" hehe byebye
