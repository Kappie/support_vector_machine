I thought i didnt have a ride to the beach cuz jon had to go to practice, but david saved my life...THNX HOMEZ!!!...so when we got there, steph told me that theyre not commin til 2:30, and it was 2:05, so i asked her if we could go to her house...so yeah...when we got there she said we have to go back to the beach, haha. so me and david went back to the beach and when we got there, we were waitin forever, then steph and them showed up around 2:40 or so, but they had to pick up jake aswell so dave dropped me off, and then they all finally got there, hehe. So we jus walked around the place and didnt know where to go, so we decided to go to jakes house...paulina was so paranoid that her mom was gonna see her, and her mom has a white van, and we saw a shit load of white vanz and jake kept on pointin them out, so that was funny. Then we made a pit stop to this one park place and we rode the swings, i havent rode swingz in a long ass time, and then when we got to jakes house, we turned back cuz it was almost time to go...haha. So then when i went to the parkin lot where david was...i asked stephanie out...and she said...YES!!!...hehe, so now im really happy...so that was my day so far...and that closes episode 3 folkz...the saga was basically devised cuz it was basicallhy the search for that special somebody and the search for happiness...so i guess the saga is basically...done...i have found the road to euphoria...and im takin it head on...later on
