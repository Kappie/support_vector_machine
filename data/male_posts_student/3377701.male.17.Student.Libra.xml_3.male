The walking distance does not matter anymore and the cold weather is not felt anymore. But it is getting colder everyday though =P its reported at about 6 degrees today. Brrrrr!!!Classes are good so far. Coping really well and there isn't reallymuch homework.Even if there was ,the lecturers wont bother to check it. So its pretty relaxed i'd say.  Two days ago we helped our friend move his stuff. He was shifting because he didn't have a proper place to stay before this ( He was sleeping at the friends' living area ) Had to carry his bags for about 20 minutes walk. Caused me a shoulder ache ( Oww ) But oh well , good deed has their rewards - he treated us dinner. How nice of him. Ohh and last night , kafaii's sis cooked us bak kut teh. Obviously it wasn't as good as back home , but who cares ? Its BAK KUT TEH !!! SYOOK!!!!   Tomoro's weekends again..... wonder wat to do ?
