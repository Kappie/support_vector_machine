To have everything I have always dreamed of having? Never shall I have that.  I am feeling so alone in this world.  I need the love of a gracious angel to come and touch me; I need to sense it near me.    Death, my only remaining friend, can you hear me screaming? Or are you gone, like everyone else?  Please do not leave me, please, I need you, I need you to keep hold of my sanity, please, donâ€™t go away.  Please don't go my Savior.
