My internet has been going extremely slow so I had to reconnect about four times.  Now I am talking to one of my friends and she is telling me that she heard a "bad but true story" (hmm...) about me that shows exactly how much of an "a-hole" I really am...that's almost funny...although, she is sworn to secrecy not to tell me the story or who told her.  And she just said that the other main person is the true a-hole in the story and not me, after she thought about it.  Hmm...I want to finish watching The Craft, but I am too tired to watch the whole thing with the commentary without passing out less than five times.  You know, water doesn't really keep your breath fresh.  I wish we had central air in this house...it becomes quite humid at points and the air flow is almost non-existant unless you were to knock down the entire front wall.  I wonder if the gas prices are going to go down and I DON'T think that the power is going to be handed over to the Iraqis by the deadline.  That new Coca Cola (C2) is kinda good.  It has half the carbs and half the sugar...although it contains phenylalanine, which is the fake sugar in diet products that causes cancer in lab rats... до завтра!
