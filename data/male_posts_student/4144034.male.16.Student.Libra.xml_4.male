I've already got a journal thing going at  urlLink deviantART , so no one really knows how long i'll be patient enough to keep this thing rolling. Probably not very long, but we'll see. I guess i'll just be copying my posts from there to here from now on. Shouldn't be too hard...should it? Hmmm, we shall see indeed. If  urlLink jark  can pull it off for 5 years, i guess i'm capable of it for 3 months....but then again he's one sex machine and i'm just some flusie. Did i just say that? Erm, okay.  So...news...news...give me some news... I'll be going to an FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America) BBQ sometime tomorrow (more like today since its almost 5:30 AM) so i guess that might be fun.  I'll probably end up getting drunk or pissed afterwards...mmm, thats news alright.  More to come after the BBQ.   urlLink
