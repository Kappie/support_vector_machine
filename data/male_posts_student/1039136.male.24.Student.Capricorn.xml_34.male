This is directly related to the fact that i lift so i can look really good for wrestling. I treat lifting like a religion. I'm a meat head anymore..and i like it. Getting involved in lifting is one of the most productive things i've ever done. I love how i feel when i get done lifting...I love the compliments..i love people calling me "the hulk" or "a beast" because it actually means people are noticing my hard work. Lifting is life right now. To the big picture...Wrestling. You're reading this, so you're going. Its May 2nd at the ZOO in WB(wilkes barre, PA for all you jersey pricks). If i know you, youre going. Its only 8 bucks. The new TEEN ICONS will be debuting against The Hardcore Mafia. Its gonna be a great tag match and I hear the Teen Icons are something you just Don't want to miss. If youre from ESU..yeah its the start of finals week, BUT give up a few hours and come see me do what i love to do.  Most everyone i know well at esu, i have given advice to and help..now this is your chance to give back to me.  I'll put a link to a good flier in my profile once its available online and my away message will tirelessly advertise the event. Wrestling is something i've been waiting to do again for well over two years. There's no better time to re-debut than the Debut show of the Valley Wrestling Alliance. You're going to see wrestling like you've never seen before.  If you love me..come get an autograph. If you hate me..come yell shit at me. I dont care..just be there.  Now to close this crappy entry, Tony asked me last night if i would rather lift or have sex. The truthful answer to that is lift.
