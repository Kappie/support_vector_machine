When we got there, we were at my grandparents house for a while, and I was asleep for most of the time. Then I went to my uncles house and watched tv on this big screen tv until everyone went to bed, then I played Yuri's Revenge with eek until 4 in the morning. The next day I went and got a 25' crossover cable so I could play xbox live on the big screen t.v. I got set up, and no one good was on xbox live. Crap. So then I went and was messing with the html of my blog template. I added the two banner ads (in black) at the top and bottom of the page. Those ads make me money. When people click, I get paid. Then it was time for the 4th of July party, and some family came and we ate and then people started to leave. Then me an my dad watched t.v. till about 9 when everyone went to bed and I had the house to myself. I waited till about 11:20 for Becky to get back from some party she went to so I could talk to her. I did, but we didn't talk for long. She had to go, leaving me all alone with no one to talk to and no sign of eek. So then I went to bed. I was about to fall asleep, when all of a sudden, my aunts dogs start howling. "Wtf?! Maybe they'll stop...ok, there not stopping...I better do something" I think to myself..."Hey shut up in there!" I yell to the dogs. Everything quiets down. I lie awake for a while. Listening for anything that could of made them howl. I can see the flashes of lightning in the distance through the window. I check the weather. Nothing unusual. I got up this morning and ask everyone if they had heard the dogs. No one had. My aunt said it was common for the dogs to start howling. If I would of known that when they started howling, I wouldn't have gotten all paranoid about why they were howling. Looking back now, it's kinda funny.  The trip to Williamsburg was relaxing and it was a nice change of scenery, and my uncles computer pwns. I woulda stayed, but Becky, and the rest of my friends are here in Rockville.  ...Good times.
