Anyway, I have to say, if your a well-off person, Whistler in the summer is the place for you, and if you're a rich person, Whistler in the winter is the place for you. Let me elaborate: Our suite cost $200 a night for our stay in the Pan-Pacific Lodge; that same suite in the winter would have cost $800 a night! (though we have to take into account $1 CAN is equal to $0.76). Anyway, I'm sorry this is getting posted so late. I won't be able to post anything next week (neither will Fred or Max) because we're going to Camp Burton. Oh, yeah... back to Canada. While I was relaxing in the hot tub and later the steam room, I met these kids from Belgium who were on holiday in B.C. Belgium people are cool. That's all I have to say. On the way back from Whistler, I read a bunch of Stephen King short stories, like "Children of the Corn", "The Last Rung of the Ladder", and, "The Man Who Loved Flowers". One word describes both Stephen King and the stories: weird. Well, that's all for now. Until later, au revoir.
