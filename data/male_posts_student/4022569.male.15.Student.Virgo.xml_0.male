Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone. Our minds collide, natural tendencies grow. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone.  I want you sow bad but I cant have you. IM not there's anything I can do. You have no idea what I'm going through. Is the a way to make it work on my own?  Please don't hang up the phone. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone. Our minds collide, natural tendencies grow. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone.  Alone, alone, Alone, alo------ne, Alone  Please don't hang up the phone. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone. Our minds collide, natural tendencies grow. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone.  For to long we talked on the phone. I know I need you cause the loneliness is gone. Please don't hang up the phone. Tonight's not a good night for me to be alone.
