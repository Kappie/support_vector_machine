I really don't think any act or legislation is going to do much to improve the human condition. The only changes that will make a difference occur within the individual. If we weren't so concerned with AIDs in Africa, we might realize that our nextdoor neighbor has a drug problem, is considering suicide, and doesn't know Christ. If we weren't so troubled about oppressed Iraqis, or whether or not our nation should be helping them, we might realize that just spending time with someone at home can make a difference. Worrying about people across the world isn't noble: it's an excuse to get you out of doing something of worth for someone you DO know. And despite what the theories of democracy would have you believe, your one vote only really counts in the sense that you're making yourself feel involved. The only people that can convince large numbers of people to vote a certain way are the politicians themselves. They have financial backing. You don't. You're just part of the mob. I'm not against voting or caring about political issues. I just don't think it's as important as people seem to think. If we started caring about things that we can fix, we'd make more of a difference than voting a certain way ever could. Christians who become highly passionate about politics need to realize one thing: Jesus wasn't a politician. He never preached about the political situation in Rome or the civil war in China. What He did was meet the needs of those around Him. Maybe if we sincerely tried to follow Christ's example we wouldn't be such useless windbags.
