I think it is going to be a blog, that everybody can use, much like Blogger.  But I have some good ideas that is going to separate it from all the others. Only 1 more week until I go to Florida! Sun, Sand, and well, and PS2! I might be going and getting a bike tonight. The last new bike I got was when I was 6. Sad almost. I am currently download 10.8 MB worth of blogging software, so I expect to be on the interent most of the day. Yipee! I'll keep you posted.  Mike
