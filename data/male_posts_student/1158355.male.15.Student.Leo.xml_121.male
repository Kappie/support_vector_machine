It seems the only good news is the sports section or the memorials and recoveries of past horrible events such as 9/11. I'm sick of war, but not only in the fields, but in the streets also, upon ourselves. Damnit you wanksters, save your money, leave those clothes you wear to act cool for the fools who are in the real gangs, the ones to be shot by cops until their brains are spattered all over the roads, blood fill our cities. Mothers killing children. Drive by shootings, terrorism just keeps flowing, innocent people are victims of these random murders. Does any of it make any sense? You have to ask yourself, "where is the love?"
