I asked for this almost a year ago, and didn't get a very positive response, so it was quite a pleasant surprise to see this.   However nothing is planed for WMA support.   The post was made in a thread started by an iPlayer owner to enquire about support for WMA on the iPlayer. The subject of Vorbis support was brought up after about 10 replies, but some quite correctly stated that more devices support WMA than they do Vorbis.  In true "me" style, I pointed out my confusion as to how, if natural market forces were at work, WMA became supported in so many players. Although that's kind of rhetorical because I think it's painfully obvious why. I could be a successful politician if only I could lie well.  So, in conclusion, iPlayer = html + mp3 + mpeg2 + email + ftp + dtt, and in the future +  ogg vorbis .  Hopefully in the not too distant future, but  this is Netgem  so typically there are no dates given.
