I think our commercial society has finally figured out the price for a human being. Propaganda.  Why do I write this? Yesterday I heard that my favourite radiochannel was probably to be kicked off the radio soon. The radiochannel I'm talking about, Kink FM, is in Holland the only channel that only plays modern alternative music. The only other channel who did that before as well is getting more and more mainstream. Why must Kink FM be kicked off the radio? Because they don't make enough money. They could better be swapped with yet another your-favorite-hits-channel. Another reason is the fact they play alternative music. Marketeers would find it great if alternative music was to be banned. Because then everybody will have to listen to mainstream music at some point. Then everybody will be a mindless zombie when it comes to music. They have turned half of the world already into hilary duff/britney spears/usher fans, the rest of the world will have to suffer that at some point as well.  There is something else about alternative music. It's free. It has a mind of its own. It breathes freedom. People who listen to it and appreciate it are likely to avoid the propaganda of the world. (listen to free*land - we want your soul) Commercial organisations don't want that. They want to have the opportunity to make everything EXTREME, everything has to be SUPER COOL and FANTASTIC. Because mindless zombies will get exited if they hear that the EXTREME, SUPER COOL AND FANTASTIC new hit-single of Aeger Avarus is available in stores NOW! But when they hear that the new single by Aeger Avarus is released they couldn't care less.  Back to more general, abstract terms. I have probably quoted fight club before about marketeers. "Marketeers makes us work jobs we don't want to buy shit we don't need." This is exactly my point. If it were up to marketeers we wouldn't have thoughts anymore. Marketeers are trying to make everything as futuristic as possible but at the same moment they want to pull back time 20 years. If it was up to me most marketeers could join the line behind mainstream music fans to talk to Pluto (people with the name Orpheus who like mainstream music can come for a nice talk to me). They make me sick. So tell em, dear marketeer, how many advertisements buy a human being?
