Time and time again the Angry Left tries to occasionally qualify their protests against Bush by saying "Oh, and Saddam was a bad man", but the statement is sounding increasingly hollow.  Their opposition to Bush becomes inseparably entangled with support for Saddam, and they continue to blur this distinction through their universal refusal to condemn the evidence of mass graves and other atrocities we are finding in Iraq.  By toppling a statue of Bush, as a symbolic gesture of payback, they establish themselves behind the proposition that Saddam should still be in power and he was removed unjustly.  They may deny that, but where are the placards and signs condemning the murders commited by the Saddam regime, or denouncing the recent bombings in Turkey?  Why is it so difficult for the Left to say "We don't agree with the war, but at least some good came out of it."    Their hatred has driven them into the arms of the enemy of civilization.  I wish them a long life, so that they can one day see their errors.
