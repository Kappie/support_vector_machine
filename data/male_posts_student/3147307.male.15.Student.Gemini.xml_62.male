KE pt people looking so hard for f ACTS  and others it was a  REVELATION . Some were in a  JAM, ES pecially since the names of the books were not capitalized, but the t RUTH  finally struck to  NUMBERS  of readers. To others, it was a real  JOB . We want it to be a most fascinating few moments for you. Yes, there will be some really easy ones to spot. Others may require  JUDGES  to help them.     I will quickly admit it usuallly takes a minister to find one of them, and there will be loud  LAMENTATIONS  when it is found. A little old lady says s HE   BREWS  a cup of tea, so she could concentrate better. See how well you can com PETE .  R elax now for there are sixteen names of books of the Bible in this story.  Enjoy! (post a few at a time if you can't find them all)
