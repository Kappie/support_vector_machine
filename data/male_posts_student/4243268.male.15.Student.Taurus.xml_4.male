In it I used Matt's line from one of his improv shows about the coffee and the bagel. Only the cult would understand.  I got to talk to Kat today which is awesome. She thinks all the guys at the camp are jerks(or most of them at least) and she says it's a lot of walking. This is because her classes are across the campus from where she sleeps. Pre SAT camp is one thing I wouldn't be caught dead at, but if Kat were there I'd quit anything to go(if it were only in PA).  Band tommorrow. Dandy.  This one time at Pre-SAT camp...
