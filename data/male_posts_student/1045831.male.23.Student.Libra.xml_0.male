Guiness is replaced with a stylish cosmopolitan but until after I am done being on the trendy "South Beach Diet."  No more watching of Cartoons, Porn or CNN, only reality shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and MTV.  I will still attend Willie Nelson's Fourth of July picnic but I will do it wearing an A cowboy hat if they make them if not I will find a womens cowboy hat and wear that.  The Journey will be long and hard but I'm sure I can make it.
