Someone probably has said that at least.  Hopefully it is true in this case.  So today was a total change from every other day of break.  Nothing at all like his various escapades of the past week.  He went outside his house once the entire day.  And that was to check the brake fluid in his car, which was fine by the way.   But Tyke is getting ahead of himself.  He has to go through his day in order.  He got up at 10 and this is where it got kinda slow.  He really didn't want to wake up.  He just wanted to keep sleeping but he knew he shouldn't cuz he will already have enough problems trying to fall asleep tonight.  So he turned on the tv to try and keep him awake.  Well, it worked but barely.  He just closed his eyes and curled up a little bit and stayed really warm and totally comfortable.  He actually managed to stay like that, on the verge of sleeping, for an hour.  And then he finally got up because his dad had made pancakes.  But after eating the pancakes he went back downstairs and showered.  That was a nice shower.  Last one of break.  So Tyke watched TV for just about the entire day.  The big tv was on for really about 12 hours.  Tyke watched the Celebrity Mole marathon that was on.  The first season of that show was really good.  Then the rest haven't been as good but they are still definitely entertaining.  Nobody really watches that show other than Tyke though.  Or at least whenever Tyke has brought it up nobody has said they liked it.  But thats ok.  Tyke really loved just looking outside today and opening (but not going outside) the downstairs door.  It was really nice out and it smelled great.  It smelled...fresssshhhhh.  And it was pretty warm too.  A tiny breeze as well.  Just a great combination.  Well, Tyke wasn't really feeling like talking to people online for almost the entire day.  So people would message him but he didn't really feel like talking.  So he didn't.  So that is why.  And he didn't really want to hang out either.  At least with guys.  But really, he didn't want to hang out at all.  Instead, he took his merry time doing his homework for the whole day and of course hardly did any of it.  Just a little government and he read this one thing for english but didn't do the questions, which are probably more important anyway.  But the reading was easy so he skimmed through that.  And he already read the play in 9th grade so it was just a refresher.  He watched quite a bit of basketball today too.  And of course he shot around downstairs.  He has to keep himself primed for the next time the Sly Lioners want another game.  And they probably will sometime soon.  Tyke and Kinker should find another 3rd for that game.  That would make it interesting.  Three different players, three consecutive wins.  It would be like a great dynasty.  Keeping a great core of players around for years and just interspersing the rest to keep a balance.  That is how it has to be done.  Well, that is pretty much all of today's happenings.  Other than discussions had online later at night.  Tyke talked pretty much only with Dr. Phil and Amed.  But those were the good conversations.  Tyke and Dr. Phil Lelee have some really good talks.  Almost exclusively about girls and Tyke's situations but they are very informative.  Tyke learns something about himself almost everytime.  Like why he is feeling empty.  And about projecting feelings onto someone.  And just subjects that are constantly flooding Tyke's mind but he doesn't really think about them in a way that solves anything.  Not that Dr. Phil really solves Tyke's problems but he assuages the "crisis" a little.  It makes it easier to bear and makes Tyke more aware of everything.  Basically, it soothes Tyke.  Which is a really good feeling.  And Tyke's talks with Amed are just wacky.  They are just really entertaining.  They are deep and shallow at the same time.  But now it is getting a little late.  So Tyke is heading off to do other things.
