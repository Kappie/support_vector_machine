Or maybe my scheme should be "random words."  I dunno yet.  I'll decide later.   I'm really sorry that I can't go with you guys to see "Pajama Game."  I'm really very upset about that, but I'll be in Iowa for a poopy soccer tournament....Comstock boys - do great! Today in choir our student teacher said that we sounded like chickens when we sang which got me to thinking (which isn't necessarily a good thing)....what if my choir and I happened to go to a farm or someplace with a lot of chickens and then started singing and the chickens were attracted to us!!!  "OMG THERE IS A CHICKEN HUMPING MY LEG!!!!!!"   Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...
