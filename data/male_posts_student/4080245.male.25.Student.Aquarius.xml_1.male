Of course, running errands consisted of dropping off a form to the EI office, returning something to Canadian Tire, picking up shampoo/conditioner/deoderant at London Drugs and wandering around the mall looking at cute girls - who, by the way, I think are much too young for me now.  It was a productive trip around the mall though as I made mental notes of where to drop off resumes when I go job hunting next week.  I don't really want to work retail anymore as the pay is not great but it would be a great way to meet girls and I could always do it until something else comes along.  Hopefully I won't want to slit my wrists after the first day.  I've started to have serving nightmares again since I started thinking about doing that job again.  Those of you who've done the job know what I'm talking about.  Mine usually consist of not being able to reach a table in time or forgetting a table or where my section is.  It's the only job I've ever had nightmares from - kind of like post-traumatic stress disorder perhaps.  Picked up a new book today - John Ralston Saul's "Voltaire's Bastards".  I read another of his books, "On Equilibrium" and found his ideas fascinating so I figured I try this one out.  It's really fat, about 500 pages so I'm sure it'll keep me occupied for a while - especially since his writing is the kind you have to reread sentences several times to understand.  I also enjoy (and find frustrating) his references to other authors and ideas as it gives me another avenue to explore and another book to read.  It can be frustrating when you don't understand the reference though but he usually explains himself quite well.  That's why I'm looking forward to school - to be able to learn the language to express my ideas and for the mental journey.  Heading into Vancity tonight for a short stop at Tonic to see a friend and then up early tomorrow morning to help another friend move from Kits to downtown.  Maybe to a rave tomorrow night in Chiliwack.  I've been invited but I'm not sure I'll go as the idea of staying up all night and doing drugs has limited appeal.  I know (I think) I'll have a good time and it's been a while since I've listened to that kind of music.  That's all for now, I'm hungry and it's time to cook dinner - steak with grilled vegetables tonight.  Oh, and before I forget the best part of my day so far - finding $50 in a pair of pants I haven't worn in a year.  I can't remember if I left it there on purpose but it was a nice surprise.  I must leave cash in my pockets more often.
