Now, that is kind of interesting to me, considering that I have seen much bigger blogs than mine and that everything still posts fine. Maybe they are having a server problem. I hope everyone is having a wonderful day today. Just thought I needed to get that out before I burst open. That is all. Okay, you can't stop reading now. You aren't listening in the slightest, I can tell. Stop reading now! I urge you to quit. Ok, you asked for it, it's your funeral.  HA! You found my secret message. Not so secret anymore.
