I don't have a digital camera phone, but I am going to put up picture that I take with my digital camera. I know I know, lots of digital camera pictures are on the website. I am going to put up the misc ones thier that I don't have time to go through. Even some that will advently appear on the site. Well I am busy trying to get the archive section of this blogger account working. Stupid thing. I guess I will have to turn to blogger for help. I just transfered it over to the new domain, instead of the Bright.net account. I am getting their day by day I guess.  Thanks all I have to say for this Blog.  As always, ((Eric))
