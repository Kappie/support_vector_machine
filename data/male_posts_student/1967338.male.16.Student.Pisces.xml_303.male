Ohhh Yeah...I'm really inclined to give you a reason.   I have one guess however because you're always online. You are playing games on the internet and never care enough to post on a collaborative blog.   Yeah I'm saber-rattling. I'm extraordinarily jet-lagged and am not in the mood to be screwed with.
