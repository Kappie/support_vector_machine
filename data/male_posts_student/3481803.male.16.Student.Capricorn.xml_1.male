It just started as a small leak in her tub, but now shes going nuts and demanding a whole new shower! Not to mention a new toilet and sink we've yet to put in...  We head to Lowe's to get some caulk so we can... caulk up the shower I guess. Somehow, we get up on a conversation about what construction vehicles my dad's operated over the course of his life. He tells me that he's "rode just about everything you see on the side of the road". I'm looking around: Doghouses? Trees? Garbage Cans? What the hell was he smoking?  Anyways, we're putting the doors on the shower and we realize that they're too big to fit the shower. So, my dad's stuck in the shower because the doors cant slide enough to make a big enough opening to get in/out of. I fall out laughing. Smokes pouring out of my dad's ears, like the demon he is, and i'm laughing my ass off.  This evening, the folks are off to some lady's birthday party. So, i'll be here alone. Again. On the computer all night. Eating cold pizza.
