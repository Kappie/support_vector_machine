[+] sometimes if i want to talk to people (which isn't terribly often, but it happens) they're engrossed in one of those stupid 10-people group conversations in which two people talk and everybody laughs awkwardly then the same two people talk and one person jumps in here or there but they don't really get involved in the discussion and so the people with nothing to talk about stare and try to look like they're enjoying themselves so if someone sees them it looks like they're part of a big group. it's always the same. or even if someone's in a small, sensible group of 2 or 3 or a thousand, why bother them? yea. [+] i want to do homework because i've been taking up calculus (which is challenging and FUN and presently my favorite subject, please shoot me now) but the library's always full and i want solitude when i work. yup. i'm impossible. [+] some days a big group thing like basketball is fun, but they SUCK when it's the same three, four, whatever people out there playing every day. only when it's organized and a lot of people play and the game's relaxed then it's worth it to come. and we haven't played basketball at all this year. [+] club meetings are worthless, as are basically every club (no offense to you officers out there). why colleges even care is beyond me. i've spent long hours cleaning the house, helping my dad do chores, showing dedication and responsibility but schools don't give a shit about that. only if it relates to extracurricular activities...blah blah...  oh well, so yes lunch sucks. anyway, mandarin's alright if only because i want to speak well and howell (who nonetheless assigns more work than...um...a lot of teachers) is better than the white demon crack-infested hyper fiend from hell that is mr. miller. art is COOL. cory's like an ideal teacher, he's knowledgeable, he doesn't mince words, he doesn't condescend to us (except to assume we can't draw lines), he thinks of some interesting projects, his classroom is relaxed, and he can TEACH. only thing i hate is how he is madly in love with notetaking from videos older than he is, when it serves no practical purpose whatsoever.  what else, today afterschool me alex cheryn and joanna went to jack in the box to eat, the girls only want me and alex just so we can carry their stuff. maan girls are so violent, cheryn slaps hard...well actually she didn't, but she says she can. damn alex beat me in fantasy football...i was up by 20! oh well. we went back to school and kevin met us and we had fun with cheryn's water bottle. again. college night tonight...go go go go everybody.
