I believe Emily (as I speak this word, a dove flies free from my mouth) said it best and I will do my best to paraphrase: "No, I wouldn't. I believe memories sculpt us into who we are." Or something to that degree. Methinks I'll take that up a notch. God sculpts us through our memories and events. I love the idea that everything I do or is done to me is like a Godly chisel scraping away a piece of marble from the sculpture of my life. Emily was completely charming, as usual. Our conversation after the movie turned and twisted all the way to her driveway. Oh, yes. And there were cookies. Girl Scout cookies to be exact. The tasty screams of still recognizable Samoas echo in my tummy. I regret not giving some to my date though. That was rude. But even with that, it was a   night.
