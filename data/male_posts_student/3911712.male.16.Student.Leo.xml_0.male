I've been watching a lot of babylon 5, which is Such a great show. I didn't write anything in the blog yestarday because, well, I was watching babylon 5, and now that I've written one log each day of the first week, I feel I'll only write when something interesting happens. And well, now,  I write, 'cause I figured I should tell ya'll (all you people who read my blog, all 0 of you).  I miss my girlfriend so much..  I don't think she misses me, she has other things on her mind (she's in england, good for her, bad for me :p).     oh well, till next time, tata
