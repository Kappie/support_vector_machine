He doesn't do his chores when he is supposed to, and when he finally does they're done half-assed. He doesn't give a damn about school, he spends nearly all of his free time with online role playing crap or watching gaming stuff on G4TechTV or crappy anime on Cartoon Network, and he's rude. I can be rude to him sometimes, but that's only because the only way he'll listen to you is if you get in his face and yell. Plus he doesn't do well with self-care. Tonight Mom was dishing out the haircuts and Josh needs his done because he has hair like Shane (Dad) and he's got a birthday sleep-over party tomorrow (thank you God!). But no, he doesn't want it cut. He said it's fine. It isn't. It's all scruffy-in-a-bad-way and he looks like a burn-out punk. And tonight Mom realized that he has no deodorant. So guess what? He gets to have the one I just got tonight at Wal-Mart and I can "make do" with what I've got left 'till we move. Like Mom's gonna have time after we move. Good grief.
