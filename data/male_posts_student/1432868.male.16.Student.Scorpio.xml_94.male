I am praying, and anyone who wants to join me, to smite Pat Roberson and the leaders of the christian colition. They are not in touch with the majority of Americans. Futhermore, they are a danger to the american people. They need to "retire" permanently.  Tomorrow begins day one.   anyone like the name "Operation Christian Freedom"?
