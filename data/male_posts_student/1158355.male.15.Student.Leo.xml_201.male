All started when I had to do this English memoir on 2 important events but I need you guys to help me figure out what the best day of my life was. You guys have better memory than me. Screw that I'm gonna go play some CS while listening to Rush. That's become a recent habit at night for me when I'm alone. Rush just keeps pleasing my sole more and more. This Rush concert is gonna be a concert for Gods. I've said this already. Yesterday (the 24th) I hung out with Dan, Matt, Heaton and Jimmy and we played some homerun derby. Then went to my house. I gave Heaton one of my army hats and $10 bucks for his birthday. Matt and Heaton went to Quiznos for a bit. Dan and I jammed to this new song we're making that's gonna be long and have lyrics that has a story in it. LIKE RUSH! I'm obsessing over them. I dressed up in my old thug clothes and wore some rosary beads I found and this necklace that can now fit my wrist, I grew(=. Right now I'm listening to Since I've Been Loving You By Zep, great shit. I'm staying up late because last night I got 10 hours of sleep and if I sleep too much during the weekend I can't fall asleep Sunday night. So we all had another baseball catch, then everyone went home and I biked with Heaton to his house because he couldn't carry his model he bought so I did. I came back then went to Friendly's with my cousins and our parents went out to dinner. I hung out with Britt, her friend Danielle and Alison and watched Panic Room. Now I sit here. Half asleep. Retarded. Still wondering if I should play CS...Nah. I'll play tomorrow. I mean tonight. Ok, now it's 6:24 PM and I'm updating today's entry. Band practice, sorta...we didn't get anything done but instead hung out at Pat's. We watched The Fairly Oddparents Movie, it was funny, especially the muffins guy walking up the hill asking if anyone wanted muffins in his funny voice. When I got home which was like 2 hours ago, I just finished my English homework which is a memoir about Jackbutt...I think I already said that in thsi blog but I'm not sure. Anyways, I'm digest from the pizza while CS'ing and then drum. Dag.
