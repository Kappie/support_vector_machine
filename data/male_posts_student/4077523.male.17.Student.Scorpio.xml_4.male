Worship is:   Your mind and heart's affection.  Responding appropriately to Him.  Your posture should be appropriate in worship.   Yall probably think the last one is a bit weird, however if you think about it, it could distract others in worship if you are too laid back or something like that. 2 Scriptures that you can look up are Romans 12:1,2 and Psalms 42:1,2.  Today was an overall good day, I am not sure how I will make it through Chemestry though. I already have a project to do and it will be very difficult to get some of it done. I got out of school before lunch today and ate at Pizza Hut for lunch, then went and helped out a little at the church. After that me and Jarrod (who isn't moving by the way) went to get something and I will tell you more in about a week or less. Well, i've got to go, Adios!
