Feel so happy to have friends around.After the meeting,my world turns quiet again.During the time,I was thinking of my loved one....feeling sad.guilty and ashamed to face her and her family members.  Planed to call my loved one's parents tonight.Hoped to get their excuse for being irrespect to them...  Suddenly,felt that heavy metal is a very nice music for the person like me.Who always feel lonely and unsecured .....  Heard from my friend that there's a quite dangerous job, need to climb to 5 level height building with only stand on an I beam.. However, the salary is good. I still hoped that I cna work for it after my graduation.  No matter how tough, I wish to work for the few years and earn my capital for the future.   Hoped that,as my birthday wish, my life will never alone in the future...   Dated 22th May 2004 6.06 PM Lonely Man
