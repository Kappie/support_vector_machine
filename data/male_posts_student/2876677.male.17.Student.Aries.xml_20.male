I had the WORST dream I have ever had!  I am not exaggerating.  It frightened me.  It was not a horror dream.  It was a normal day...with twists.  Awful, gut-wrenching twists, that tore my soul in two.  It was like a premonition of today.  I am really hoping the dream is not foreshadowing what is to come.  If it is I will throw up.  I spent from 2:00-3:30 thinking about it.  At that time, I thought it was the yesterday, and I was sickened and just could not go to school.  At about 3:30, I realized that it could not have been a Monday in my dream and that it was "just a dream".  I spent the next half hour or so praising God that these people I had dreamed about had not said the awful things they said and done the awful things I thought they had done.  I was so thankful because in my dream I was shocked these people were doing all these things.  People I respect, People I trust, People I look up to were all doing horrible sin and everyone was participating.  It seemed like everyone was ignoring me and no one cared what I was saying about God.  I left in disgust.  Only one person left to follow me to see why I just walked out as if he could not understand why.  I told him I could not believe he had just said the things he talked about.  I could not believe he had sunken to the levels of my peers.  With sadness in his eyes, he left.  I rejoiced thinking he had repented.  I went back to talk to him more only to see him back doing the same things.  He looked at me with hate and told me never to come back .  It killed my heart.  The dream was so intense so real.  I pray it doesn not happen.  It has already been four and a half hours and it stills feels real and personal.  My hero feels shattered and broken.  I do not know if I can face him.  I do not know if I can go and look at him and think of him the same as before.  It was not him.  I know it was not him.  I know it was a dream.  I know he did not truly say the words echoing in my head.  I know he did not do the things seared into my memory, flooding back across the screens of my eyes every time I close them.  The suffering was so intense, the debauchery so real, the hate so painful-it was real to me.  I hope I can get over this dream.  I know everyone was awful but for some reason even in the dream he is the only one that seemed unnatural.  The only one I truly could not believe was sinning so grossly and profanely.  The one who initiated it.  I pray I can concentrate today, but my heart still hurts from my wicked imaginations.  I wish I could wipe this dream away.  Only I know that the man I saw in my dream is real.  He is inside my hero, inside you,...inside me.
