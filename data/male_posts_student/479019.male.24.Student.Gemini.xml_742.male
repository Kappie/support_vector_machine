Today in class, Utku said that we shouldn't mind Foucault's ego in his interviews, because we can still learn a lot from them. The funny thing is that yesterday he tore the Ellis piece apart due to her ego. I mentioned this to Utku and he laughed.  Another academic irony is that I saw a link to a "What kind of postmodernist are you?"   urlLink quiz   on Crystal's blog. I took it and it said that I'm a theory slut. Haha... I think I am much more theoretical than empirical. That's probably why I'm a sociologist and not a historian; however, I still have a stronger affinity to history than sociology.  I'm gonna pay the Ale House a visit later.  ***
