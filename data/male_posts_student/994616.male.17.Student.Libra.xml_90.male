Marioparty later at deons place, wit luke should be very cool, sorry for no long interesting sentences or chains of thought but my mind was used up when i was trying to figure out math. can anyone explain to me how to diferentiate tan^3(x/3) ? or was it 3/x either way i dont get it. if it was just tan(x/3) it'd be easy. i probably should have paid attention in math.   lots of good notes tonight, and here's another i might be going to krispy kreme tomorrow, mmm krispyliscious...this time though i shall get two boxes of plain - they're the best.   1 up shroom Censoring for audiance - i feel like FOX 'News' and i use the term news loosley  Poisoned shroom: *insert name of clash crush who isnt quite gone yet* damn flash crush remnants
