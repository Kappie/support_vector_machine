Then he talked about work ethic and how everyone hasnt work hard enuff...yeah i know i havent worked to my potential and i know i can do better, im jus worried about my teammates mentality cuz i want our team to b successful...then he started talkin about pplz drama and stuff, mostly from the girlz team. I dont give a shit about the drama that the girlz team have, i dont give a shit really about drama period...its a stupid thing that everyone goes through, they jus have to build a bridge and get over that shit. Anywayz, we did some run-through drillz and a couple of ppl got coach-on-onez and a lil bit of hitting. My hitting is suckin hardcore, so i need to work on that once finalz r over cuz i have to study so i can keep the grades that i want or get the grades i want. Well tomorrow is probly my tuffest day for finalz, so i best get to the studyin...the saga continuez
