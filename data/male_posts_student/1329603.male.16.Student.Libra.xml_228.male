As a result, I'm taking it off my about bit, but still. Patrick, I dunno whether bringing other people with me would be a good idea because I'm looking for a single person shot. If you want people with you to make sure I don't rape you or anything, fair enough =p. I know you don't like certain 'chav' spots, but unfortunately the better areas of Cheltenham happen to often have chav inhabitance. Unfortunately. For example, Sandford Park. Beautiful place but with a serious chav prescence. Up to you I guess.  Had my last EVER maths lesson today. Words cannot describe how good that felt.  Love, Jon Roskilly
