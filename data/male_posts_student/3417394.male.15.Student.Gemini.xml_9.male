    
       Today I went to Relay for Live with my mom and met up with Chaley. Her and I walked back to her house because we were gunna swim. Chaley's boyfriend doesn't want her talking to boys and most of all me. So she was a little worried. But we were swimming for awhile when the dog started barking and Chaley's boyfriend can out the back door. I couldn;t do anything but laugh I thought it was really funny but apparently not her boyfriend. So though it'd be best to change and leave so I did.
