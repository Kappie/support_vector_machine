We already know he was immature, but the very fact that he had not THOUGHT through his column before publishing it is further indication of his emptiness.  If you take the time to write an opinion piece, you should be darn certain that you actually stand behind your words.  Otherwise, why are you writing them?  And if he really does believe every word he wrote (which I suspect he does), he should stand behind what he said even in the face of the outrage.    Words mean things.  Use them with the care they deserve.
