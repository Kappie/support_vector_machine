NOT! its a pirate show at treasure island where a ship of muy caliente women aer seductive pirates and capture a man pirate (ha that sounds funny....man pirate...) and then the man pirates ship and crew try to save him and junk like that....honestly, i dont think any of the guys were watching the man pirates ship, and non of the women were watching the seductive peoples ship....but hey, its vegas what do you expect...i also witnessed some firsts, for example, i saw 4 different pairs of lesbians (very ugly women if i may say) and also, you know how guys usually take those bad magazines? well i saw a woman take one. "CRAZY TALK!" YOU ARE SAYING...well its true...oh also i saw a man with no arms or legs, and i felt really bad for him, i was gonna put money in his lil basket thingy, but i didnt have any...poor guy...anyways i need to eat before i die ok? byebye
