We'll win some, and lose some, just like a real team.  Anywho, the team we played were abunch of asses....Mainly a player in the #11 jersey, he yelled and crap at almost EVERYTHING we did....So did some parents...Thank god the ref was fair (unlike the ref at Los Alamitos....jerk), because there was a lot of tension between the teams.  I knocked a few people over, but in the first half I was taken out by one of those jerkoff players...injured my left knee.  Can't put weight on it for awhile either.  Hopefully it'll heal up before Monday.  Well, as for me now, I'm bushed, I'll see you all on the flipside...Ta.
