Then I got back home and let   urlLink Melissa   crash at my place. The silly girl didn't realize that her dorms didn't open until today, so she was homeless. She, as a source of amusement, was once again a target for me and my Sharpie pen. I wanted to write "homeless" on her forehead, but she woke up with only "ho" written on her. I'm such a good friend huh?  Anyway I managed to get some writing done for my paper on Hong Kong. Writing about diaspora is complicated stuff. For example the fact that Hong Kong and Taiwan are the result of complicated migrations of Chinese people in themselves, it gets even more complicated in regards to cinema. The production of Chinese movies in these places were very much affected by Chinese populations in Southeast Asia and the United States. So I'm trying to capture the ephermality when it comes to the idea of a "national" cinema, for a borderless population. I guess that's why there are whole books on writing about diaspora.  I guess this brings into the question of identity for immigrant populations, which is something that my friends and I have been talking about lately. As Rey Chow writes, a way of dealing with diaspora is, "to  unlearn  that submission to one's ethnicity such as 'Chineseness' as the ultimate signified." (page 25 of  Writing Diaspora ). Chow doesn't say that one's background is to be ignored, but at the same time she doesn't think something like being Chinese is an all encompassing and total experience.  Anyway... I'm thinking of reworking some of the CSS on my page. So that my representation of self in cyberspace is changed a bit. We'll see...  ***
