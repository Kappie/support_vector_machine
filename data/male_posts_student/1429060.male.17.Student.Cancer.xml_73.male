Those movies seem to have such an odd effect on me, despite the enjoyment I perceive whilst watching them. And no one is on IM, it appears. Bloody hell. I need to talk to someone. Forgive this small paragraph. 'tis all angsty shit.  You know what? Telemarketers have secured our fax number and  they are sending us fucking faxes for products . Does that strike anyone as, say,   illegal   to the maximum it possibly can be? I mean, indeed, phones are oft used as a telemarketing tool, but the telemarketers are paying for the damn right to call me/us/whoever and preach about a product nobody wants. And that is legal. The no-call list may be argued, but it is nonetheless legal. (Damn our luck.) But faxing! We pay for the fucking paper that they print their shhhhhhhit out on! That is our paper! Is this not some subtle act of - perhaps -  THIEVERY ? (quote the American Heritage Dictionary:  thievery   n.  The act or practice of taking by stealing; larceny.) Are we stating that they are now common criminals? Because this is bullshit. Bed enough that they call, now they make us pay for their fucking sales practices that we want NO part of.  My apologies to telemarketers. It is not thee to whom I direct my anger. I am irked by your occupation. Because if there is one thing on earth that is hell-derived, 'tis the concept of telemarketing.  Cheers, mortals.
