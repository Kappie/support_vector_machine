The program wasn't really controversial, actually -- the SGA would provide signs for faculty and staff interested, and those signs would designate their room a  safe place , or somewhere where no one would feel any sort of trepidation because of their lifestyle or beliefs.  The controversy was about the money somewhat, and the impact mostly.    The first naysayer was expected.  Carolyn Morris, a senator lucky to make her way back for her senior year, brought up the financing issue...we were going to pay $150 to get about 200 of these things printed.  A big printing cost.  She said she could go use her sorority's copier to do it for a lot cheaper.  Dawson Taylor, the SGA president who had relinqushed the chair to me for this debate, said he wanted it done right...often things get said and then never done, and if they budgeted for it, he would be sure to see it through.    It was the second person who surprised all of us.  Zach Vaughn, a proactive senior senator with a wife and child, who took an interest in politics in only his senior year, asked about effect.  Would this really make any sort of difference?  Shouldn't this money be allocated somewhere where it would make a difference, rather than for some posters that people won't notice.  He spoke well, and Dawson was too impassioned on this debate to offer more than zealous unrefined speech.    So Zach ended up with a few followers.  Leif Sherry, Matthew Philbrook, Justin Kirkes, Drew Sutton all fell in line...the SGA could do something great here...why spend the money on the posters when we could do something else.  Something far-reaching.  Posters was a waste of our time.  That, in conjunction with the more traditonal frat-minded senate members, made the vote a close call.  Quite a close call, actually.  Of the 20 senate members with voting rights (I, as acting president, was not voting), the vote was split 10-10.  Which meant that I would be the tiebreaker.  This was my third year on the senate, my first in an executive council position.  I was often the most prepared and the most well-spoken of the senators, but in the popularity contest that was SGA, my contributions were cheered but not remembered (whereas Danielle West sat on her ass and won the Bullet Award, but I digress).  What I prided myself on was voting what the students I represended thought (I never felt like I represented my grade...I instead felt like I represented the non-fratsters, non-athletes), and if it was an issue of value, I'd vote either by the rules dictated by the SGA, or if the rules didn't say whether the vote was germaine or not, I'd vote conscience.    This was a conscience pull...we were doing something for the students, there wouldn't be any protest or interest for that matter from the students...so it was up to me.  I was going to make this sink or swim.  Pass or play.  Man up or man overboard.    And I wanted to vote with Zach.    I liked the idea of making a difference, doing something great...promoting diversity, using educaiton, all the cliche bullshit that sounds incredible when you're 20 and haven't seen its failures yet.  We could do something more.  Why stop at posters?  What good had posters ever done.    But when it came to me, I quickly voted in favor of the resolution, and relinqushed the chair back to Dawson.    Many thought it was politics, especially after I told Leif and Zach over a few beers that I agreed with their point, yet voted otherwise.  I gave several reasons to them...first off, it was just $150...for all the money we had, to float it for this seemed quite worth it in relation to other expenditures.  Secondly, it was Dawson's pet project, and Dawson was kind of my boss.  The last thing I wanted to do was get on the wrong side of my boss with a convincing vote.    In the end, though, it wasn't about politics.  It wasn't about the money, and it wasn't about playing kissy face for the power god of Centenary's SGA.  It was about my ability to do more.  And I didn't have it.  With a bill passed, we had some posters, some signfiers to show support for tolerance and embracing diversity.  Maybe I wanted to do more, but in the end, was I really going to?  If this was what someone who was passionate about tolerance was pushing for, who was I to poo-poo his idea?    ---  And now we get to the present, and what will probably be the end of the Screenwriting MA Script Readings.  We don't get a lot of help from the department regarding our professional lives...at least we don't get as much as the MFA production kids do.  They get a Hollywood Showcase, and we don't.  And yes, we don't really have a medium for showing, but because the program does little to aid screenwriters in finding directors to shoot their work, we'd like something at the end of the day to walk home with.   The plan, as I blogged earlier, was to take our scripts, get some actors, and stage readings somewhere like The Hideout.  Do it over a couple of nights (playing one up as the main event), get some publicity, maybe get some industry folks there (probably not, but think big), and celebrate ourselves as writers, because chances are few if any of us will ever have a night like this again.    It was Denton's baby, but I became the spearhead on it, as I often do with things...not because I want a power trip, but because I take charge of dormant situations.  Denton wanted to do it, but I've led things like this before.  So we drafted up an idea of what we were going to do, and after several whittles and cuts of ideas, came up with giving everyone the opportunity to do this.  I sent out an email at the beginning of the week.  No comments until tonight, when Tripper brought up location and length...who pays for a rental of a location, and how do we make this prestigious if everyone gets to read?  Can we get audience for three nights?  The email wasn't accusatory, but did little other than question issues that are really unanswerable...he's right about his thoughts, but it's one way or the other, and no one is charging to do it the other way.  So I answered him back.  And then Andrew chimed in, and before I even opened the email, I fucking knew he was gonna shit on this, and he did, asking what the point of the whole thing was, and taking his script out of the running, which isn't a good thing suprisingly, because the domino effect could take hold...Tripper goes, then Debbie and TK, and it's me and the DH's rather than the department.    I understand that they want this thing to be good.  Fucking hell, I do too.  I want to make every motherfucker happy, give everyone a sense of accomplishment, and get everyone read to an audience.  Maybe reading Debbie's script gives it the life it needs, and someone hears it and really likes it.  Probably not, but hey, it's read, and she has the memory of when her script was performed.  Same for TK, me, everyone else.  Does it have to be for anything else?  It's a celebration.    It might not seem like a big deal, these emails and all, but it kind of is.  They're offering nothing, just questioning what is there.  I ask them  come up with something better , and they would not...they might think about it, but when it's go time they're not going to have done it.  And that's not saying anything against them...it's just how it is.  We've all been there.  But when I'm working my ass off to organize something that will benefit them, no matter the shape it is in, and they just question it, and the questions cannot be answered to satisfy everyone, and it delays the proceedings to the point where we have nothing...and then it doesn't happen.  And no one gets their shit read, and that's that.  Bureacracy at it's finest.
