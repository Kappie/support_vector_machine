TALK about shock!!!   it was supposed to make us appreciate our dress code. lol  holly cried and wouldnt stopeven after he told us it wasnt serious, 40 mins into the class. we're having some vote tomorrow on it, but they wont take the results as final, only a suggestion.  I swear I'll switch schools if they brong uniforms. everyone else said they would.   lunch...multi-cul club....  math.....im horrible. i dint really get what he was explaining, but i still talked to becky the WHOLE time(MEXIHO!) AND HE GOT PISSED AND SAID 'some PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING THIS whole TIME, AND IF THEY THINK THEYLL GET HELP ON THIS AFTER SCHOOL, THEYRE WRONG!" (whoops caps lock was on) and he said this because i had said id idnt get it earlier..lol  then i went home......at 2...i had free last and mom had to go to TO for meeting or soemthing..   Brighton was rather happy. She had a pretty pinkish dress on, a change from depression.   I didnt see yana...i have to ask her what breeana is wearing to the dance....  hm.......................................... i had horribly odd dreams last night that i cant say. i woke up latish because i didnt liek the song that went off on my alarm and just turned it off.  at 2 AM in the ngiht i woke up all disoriented and jumped out of bed, afraid i was late for something and worried. i went to the bathroom and was afraid i would jump into the shower like i did a while ago.   mhm...  the new shower cap scares me. it shocked me when i turned on water this morning. ill take a shower later...
