Eddie George, who was on Madden 2001 , failed to break 1000 yards and Tennessee went 7-9. The Curse came again when Daunte Culpepper, who was on Madden 2002 missed 4 games with injury, threw for 1300 less yards and 19 less TD's then in the year before. Minnesota's had its worst record since 1984, 5-11. When Marshall Faulk was on Madden 2003 he rushed for 430 less yards and had 4 less TD compared to the year before. His worst season since 1996. The Rams scored only 16 more points then their 1996 team who had Tony Banks at QB and Lawrence Phillips at RB. And last Year, when Michael Vick was on the cover of Madden 2004 he missed the first 11 games with a broken leg. His QB rating, comp pct, and yards per attempt were all down from 2002. This year with Ray Lewis on the cover of Madden 2005, the world will have to wait and see if the curse is finally over.
