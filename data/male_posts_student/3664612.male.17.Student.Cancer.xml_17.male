It came as a surprise for me since i didnt know she was coming here. The day she arrive my mum said "you dont have plans tonight right, because we're eating dinner at a restaurant." Being me, i love to eat food so i said, sure why not. Just before we left my mum said to wear nice clothes. But hey anything that i put on will look nice matter what, since im sooooo good-looking xD  Anyways by the time we got to the restaurant my mum mentioned that Annisa's family is coming. I was like "what the F**K!" why didnt she told me sooner. Maybe its just the shock of having one of my closest friends coming to Canberra, since its been 6 months since i last saw her. What i hated most from that dinner was how my sister acted towards me. Since i used to date Annisa and my sister cant get over it, and always kept mentioning how we're 'made for each other' A load of bullcrap. But the dinner went smoothly. I forgot to mention that the dinner was with a lot of the embassy workers. This is because Annisa's father is a high ranking government thingy, i dont know what he does but i know that his ranking is high. Anyways the food was great it one of those fusion restaurants with cuisines from all over the world.  After the dinner and after all the workers said goodbye and shit like that. On my way back home for some reason i cant stop thinking about how i used to feel about her. I have no idea why it happened that day, since when i last saw her in Indonesia, there was nothing....and now theres that thought. Maybe thats why the title is 'Laughable'. I guess its just one of those things ill have to learn to forget.  On the plus side since she is here i could give her the present i was going to give all my friends, if i get to see to her again before she leave and i dont have presents for all of my friends then i gotta remember to give her my red hat to christina and my old NY cap to her and maybe something for Damien
