Brazil had no idea until he started meowing at the door.  Sam escaped through the sliding door a few times; the first time Brazil didn't even notice it seemed, the second time he ran right underneath where she was sitting and hissed, but as soon as I picked him up and threw him back in the other room, it's like she totally forgot he was there.  Maybe this will work out...  Here's the only pictures I could get...  they are no good, but I couldn't get anything better because Sam does not sit still for more than a second.
