I want to just be free once, and let the fuck loose, not that im uptight or something. I don't mean some normal party or something, all it takes is sometime when I am enjoying myself greatly. We definately forgot about our water fight we were supposed to have! Shit Sara I needa call you because I will not let this not happen. Oh and it's more fun when you're in normal clothes because then you feel like you ruined something.  Dont you wish that there was music playing all the time. Wouldn't life be better if your memories in your mind had some sort of music attached to them. It's like when you listen to the radio or something and then you're thinking and its like hey this song goes. I htink it'd b kool if there was music playing like there is in movies. Sort of to add to the emotion and feeling in life. It would be cool.  I had like 3 relaly weird dreams the last 2 nights. First last night I dreamed I had been in a sort of Day After Tomorrow incident where there was a big flood and there were these HUGE waves and we got stuck inside and then everyone was scared to go outside because of the unknown. Then I had this dream that we were playing soccer in a gym except whenever I would look at the goals it would be grass on the floor and regulation sized goals but we were still in a gym. And we won the game, I woke up all happy because of the plays in that game. It was like the kind you would want to be a part of in real life. And the other was like this really scary dream. There was some sort of science horror killer on the loose and she like ate people and shit. And so like we were all in this one room of the house but it had a front door and stuff on it and it had a dead bolt. And we had like gathered our stuff and then we forgot stuff. And the lady was in the house and we had to rush to get this other stuff and my sister like got in the door and we locked it as she came up the stairs and she just went back down and later there was this lttle girl at the screen door (dunno why the big one was open) and I told them no its a trick she just wants us to get out of the room. And she ended up being upstairs and she just rather easily ripped the door off its hinges and came in, but she didnt attck me or my other sister she just came in and looked around, and I was doing all I oculd to suck up, you know how it is in the movies and your dreams. And then the dream ended, but I was scared out of my wits for somereason. I always like to have the off scary dream.
