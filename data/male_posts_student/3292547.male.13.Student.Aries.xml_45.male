That means, for any circle, you can divide the circumference (the distance around the circle) by the diameter and always get exactly the same number. It doesn't matter how big or small the circle is, Pi remains the same. Pi is often written using the symbol  and is pronounced "pie", just like the dessert.   Because Pi is known to be an irrational number it means that the digits never end or repeat in any known way. But calculating the digits of Pi has proven to be an fascination for mathematicians throughout history. Some spent their lives calculating the digits of Pi, but until computers, less than 1,000 digits had been calculated. In 1949, a computer calculated 2,000 digits and the race was on. Millions of digits have been calculated, with the record held (as of September 1999) by a supercomputer at the University of Tokyo that calculated 206,158,430,000 digits. (first 1,000 digits)      Pi   3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105 82097494459230781640628620899862803482534211706798214 80865132823066470938446095505822317253594081284811174 50284102701938521105559644622948954930381964428810975 66593344612847564823378678316527120190914564856692346 03486104543266482133936072602491412737245870066063155 88174881520920962829254091715364367892590360011330530 54882046652138414695194151160943305727036575959195309 21861173819326117931051185480744623799627495673518857 527248912279381830119491298336733624    If you don't understand any word of this, then join the millions of people who don't (or I like to think who don't) I really did have much to say today, so instead I decided to post on  Pi . I got this calculation using the  Power Calculator   urlLink here .You can find lists with thousands of digits on the net- Just search in  urlLink Google . This isn't even icing on a cake. =-)
