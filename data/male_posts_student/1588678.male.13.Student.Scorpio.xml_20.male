This means you can look forward to viewing pictures, downloading media, and never having to look at an ad again (unless Seth starts selling ad space!).    Thanks to Kimmy at Blogger for upgrading the site for me while Blogspot's online ordering was down.  And congratulations to Seth on moving one step closer to adulthood!  Let me know what it's like to be a grown-up.  I'm still not sure.  And while I'm at it, Seth and I both wish our brother Adam a happy birthday.  Stay away from open flames, man.
