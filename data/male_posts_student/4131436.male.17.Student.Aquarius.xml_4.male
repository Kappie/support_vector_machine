Nothing much today.. Except today during recess.. Chammon ram the soccer ball into the heads.. Yes heads! Of marching St. Johns recruits.. When the ball struck their heads.. Guess what.. The girl was like drunk man!! Hahahaha!! Rayner, Yan, Jonathan, Nashir and me was laughing our ass out man!! Hahaha! Kinda funny though.. No matter... During DT today, I cut my finger.. I wanna drill a hole on my metal piece and the thing suddenly got stuck and the metal piece turns like crazy cutting my finger along the way... *OuCh!!* Got it washed and plaster applied.. Kinda painful man.. Not being petty ok?! Just telling the truth.. Ok.. After school, Nashir, Mas, Justin and me headed to KFC to have our lunch and as usual... We laugh our ass out again man!! That Nashir and Justin.. *SiGhZz* They like to burst my stomach man.. It was cramped just now..Mas jaws are cramped.. Hahahaha!!! Anyway.. Reached home and did nothing.. Sleep all the way till dusk.. Woke up.. Bath.. And here I am!! Haha!! Ok.. Sms Cheryl and had some intimacy through the phone.. Hehe! She's just adorable man.. I think she likes me... Just a thought.. Hehehe! We get kinda deep just now.. Not so deep though... Hehe! She's not in school today.. And I miss her.. Haha!  Peace Out!!!
