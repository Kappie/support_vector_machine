I don't really wanna talk much about it, because people feel that if I spend too much time thinking about it then I might screw up the other more important things in my life. Not that I believe in that...  I beleive that this is my biggest strength rather than a weakness... But yes, I am willing to listen to other this time, simply because I don't want them complaining that I didn't listen.  I am not in a position to commit, nor do I know what the future holds for us... I just know that I want you to be happy...  Wonder what they mean...  Some day I will know... Salvation in 22 days... some may agree, some may disagree, none can ignore..... Someday looking back at this post, I will wonder why I ever put this online. today I'm just glad that I am doing this. If you are reading this and it doesn't make sense to you... don't worry, it's not meant to be.  This is me all alone....
