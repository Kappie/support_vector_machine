Let's face it - a wedding can single handedly divide any relationship in two seconds flat.  It still bewilders me how what should probably be the most beautiful, romantic event in a person's life can bring out the fangs and claws.  Underneath the Cinderella gown, crystal tiara and photo perfect makeup application is a terrorist attack waiting to happen.  Seriously!    Ah well, but after all the confetti and icing sugar settles, we'll all be back to being just regular people who love each other...or at the very least stand to be in the same room with each other and all those disagreements and misunderstandings will be forgotten.  Cheers to marital bliss and tons of champagne to go with that.
