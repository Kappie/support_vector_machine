On ebay, they're a little cheaper, around $40.  I'm not that anxious to connect my laptop up to my 15 cents/min cell phone, but it would also allow me to backup my contacts on my cell and install new ringtones.  However, while searching ways to connect a laptop to a cell phone I came across a guy who lives out of his RV and decided to build his own rudimentary connection system.    Take your phone off the hook (The phone that's only plugged into your modem) and grab a cellular headset. Take the part you press into your ear and tapes the earpice to the mouthpiece of the phone, then take the microphone part of the cellular hands free and tape that part to the hearing [speaker] part of the phone.  Then dial your local access number [The one you call when your own your home computer]  Try to hold the earpiece of the handsfree up to your ear. As soon as you hear that terrible screetching noise click DIAL CELLULAR, the laptop will then wait 2 seconds and send out the calling tone that the internet service provider is waiting for.  Before you know it it says connected and you will be happy as can be.  This guy is fascinating!  He actually hooked up a handset to his computer, taped the earpiece of a headset of a cell phone to the phone and got his computer to connect.  His only downside: when his wife vacuums, the phone picks it up and disconnects.  I'd try it, but I think I'd rather buy the cord than waste money on a project.  There's cheap Luke poking his ugly head out again.
