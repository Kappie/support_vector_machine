"mozell mozell...good things". yeah...i didnt get anything, b/c i couldnt find the shoes that i wanted, but thats ok--im just gonna hit up nordstroms again later and see if they have some more in stock. we came home, and im not supposed to be using the computer b/c my mother said that i have been "disrespectful" or some crap like that...really mom? wow, thats interesting--im DEPRESSED. i dont give a crap what ppl think i'm like around the house. if i don't feel good....WHO CARES? sooo i've been like "satan" in my house since yesterday morning, which is fine with me...whatever. tomorrow is another family function...and im bailing. i need a partner in crime, otherwise im gonna go shopping by myself or just walk around the mall aimlessly and visit ppl that i know at work or w/e. screw this crap--i'm out.    p.s.-- congrats to sarah rodrigues on her new marriage....allie's up next (GASP)...suzy, hope you read that one ; )
