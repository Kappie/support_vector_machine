My feelings for him are growing and i don't know how to stop it. It's like its alive in me and we're still alive, knowing that we're done with that relationship. With everyone else, friends is enough and I can't nor want anything more. This time, I want more. I want it from him. He's the one I want. I go crazy every now and then just thinking and letting it through that its over. But what do you do when you have all the love and care in the world, but you have no one to give it to? What do you do when the one you want doesn't want you like that anymore? What do you do? My friend Tinka said this should have been our song or my song for him. It's k-Ci n JoJo's CraZY   "I can't think, think about this crazy day I lose sleep just to daydream about you babyyyyyyyy I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just to thinkin about you lately (crazy baby) I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, just to thinkin about you baby (I don't know  what to do) I'm going crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, thinkin about you lately (crazy, crazy,  crazy) I'm going crazy, crazy, (crazy, crazy) when I can't touch you Crazy, crazy (I'm going crazy) when I can't hold you Crazy, crazy, (I'm going crazy) when I can't see you again (Said I'm going crazy"   Today makes one week of our break-up. I've built the illusion of us still being togeter. The reality of it being over hasn't fully sunk in nor will it for a long time. He's not jsut someone where i can buy something and think to myself it's ok forget about that like it was nothing. This was something that retail therapy isn't going to help at. There isn't enough stuff in the world to buy to make me forget about him. I guess the fear of the unknown and the what if's are what's keeping me going. What if i wasn't so naggy? What if i didn't listen to everyone around me about how i treated him? What if we gave up and this could be what we were looking for; What everyone in life looks for? That someone where even if you feel and look like shiet, they'll tease you about it and tell you that your still good. The feeling of knowing you can count on someone more then friends...  it's 8:42 A.M and I'm going to end this post. I'm going to go through my memmory box i have of mines and his. Maybe just like death, i should celebrate the relationship and the fun we had and not mourn over it ending.  Maybe it wasn't ment to be...............or maybe it is and we're too young to realize.
