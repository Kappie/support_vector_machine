I'm just posting this as I sit, munching, on Viet food, spring rolls, noodles, and fried rice @ a comp in my cousin/best girl-friend's house. (Note that this friend is a girl.) .......    *24 minutes later*    ....sorry just came back..left the post unfinished, strangest thing is, I was here tonight to mourn the 49 days after the passing of my best friend's grandmother's death.    We were praying, and I had my head down. When I raised my head to look at the picture of the deceased, I started to have a uncontrollable nosebleed. Strange enough, the bleeding subsided after the prayers were done, approximately 15 minutes later...I don't think I'll have good luck for another year or so....cia0....^_^
