This is about a friend of mine that I met while looking for Modest Mouse fans on blogger. She's really funny, got a head on her shoulders, a cool person to talk to, and most importantly for most of you, taking after it's author, her blog is really cool*. Perhaps a little too cool for her own good o.O. Her name is Christina and a link to her blog is here:  urlLink  Orange Ink    Seriously, if you're not gonna check it out, you better have something better to do than just go look at someone else's blog (even the rest mine)... Like paint a picture... of a guy... with a big knife... or playing some hot lixx like "meedley meedley meedley meedley meedley meedley meedley meedleeeeeyy" or something productive like checking out  urlLink  Strong Bad E-Mails   But even if you do these other great things like paint, play guitar, or watch e-mails, I think you really should check out her blog on top of it all :-).  That is all. -- Feanor  * In my opinion
