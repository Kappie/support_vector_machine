Track, we had to sprint a mile. Then I had to practice the relays with Ron York, Robert Ball and Kevin McLoughlin. We were running the 4x100 along with Shawn Kreiger, how ever you spell that, Nolan Porker, some dude that doesn't talk much and Chris Fletcher. Obviously they won. Kevin and I just stopped to find out they had already finished while I hadn't even gotten the hand off yet. That was gay. Oh, I forgot to say Mr. Shelley loved my bullying essay on somebody. IM me if you wanna know who it is. I got home today, got that new Linkin Park CD, Meteora... then copied it onto my computer for Joe Tringali. I played alot of drums today, gotta stay good for the band. One more thing, I made a milk shake.  For now on, I want everyone to know, I'm not going to explain the quotes I put on. I'll leave that up to you. Most of them are self explanatory and vague... ya you'll understand   most of them but some of them are hard!           ONE MORE THING, I'm obsessive compulsive so I must repeat this everytime. For now on, new subjects won't skip a whole line, for now on, I'll just hit enter and hit spacebar 10 times (tab) to be in paragraph form. Right now here comes the bus to school! CRAP! Later Pe...
