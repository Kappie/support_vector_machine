(I think that’s it’s spelled…) He’s a web designer. Their kid is Robert he’s like an anime with funny impressions and Josephine’s sister is Rosy. She is really funny. I’ll tell you some of the things she does later. Her daughter name is Terrah. (Say it like Terra from FF5) She’s really different. Quiet and fun. On Monday we went to Liberty Island. (Where the statue of Liberty is) We couldn’t go upstairs to the crown but I still had fun. (I’ll post pictures later). I tried talking to Terrah during the boat ride there she’s quiet. It was my first long boat ride. I had been on boat rides but there weren’t that long. That night in my aunt/uncle’s apt I tried talking to Terrah. We talked and told stories she’s really cool. I kind of like her but I don’t know + she’s leaving on the sixteen of this month. So forget about it
