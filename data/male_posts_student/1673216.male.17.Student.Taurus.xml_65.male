A relatively small and eternally quarrelsome country in Western Europe, fountainhead of rationalist political manians, militarily impotent, historically inglorious during the past century, democratically bankrupt, Communist-infiltrated from top to bottom.    -William F. Buckley  There's always something fishy about the French.   -Noel Coward  (heh)  How can anyone govern a nation that has two hundred and forty different kinds of cheese?   -Charles De Gualle  Boy, those French - they have a different word for everything.     - Steve Martin  Frenchman have an unlimited capacity for gallantry and indulge it on every occasion       -Moliere   (!)  The French complain about of everything, and always.      -Napoleon I  France has neither winter nor summer nor morals - apart from these drawbacks it is a fine country     -Mark Twaine  France is the country where the money falls apart and you can't tear the toilet paper.   -Billy Wilder     That's all of them , haha
