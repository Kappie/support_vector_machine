Next thing you know my car is all scrunched up in the front and my head light is hanging by a thread. So who do i call first? The one person i know with the most car accident expirence alive, my sister. Rory grabs the phone from me and tells her "Robert got in a car crash and im in a world of pain." So naturally she freaks out and starts cyring and says she wishes she was there to help me, but eventually i calm her down. So my mom is pissed, my step dad is pissed, i am positive that my car pissed.  Now i have to find out how much its gonna cost to fix and pay half. This is all fine by me, but of course in ym life nothing is ever that simple. After years of escaping confrentatin my dad and Rustyt can no longer avoid it. AND IM IN THE MIDDLE...AGAIN. But life isnt all shitty these days for me. There is a certain special someone, someone who got me to start this so i could leave notes and his. Even though i crashed my car im not down bc i still get to see cullen tonite!
