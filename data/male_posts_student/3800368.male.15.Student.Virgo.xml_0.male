Its started out bad cuz I overslept til like 2:30 when I had plans with Tim at 11:30 to go to the local EB games and the bike trail. But, we did get a chance to hang out like 5 mins after I got up, lol. but we didnt go to EB but we did go to 7-11 which was kinda worthless cuz we got this wanna-be surge drink that had a messed up after-taste. but it was cool. I did this awesome tailslide while riding off the trail to test my new diamondback, woo7. And, the rest of the day was just boring, I had to babysit my mom's co-worker's son, but   honestly I didnt watch him, i just went back in my room and watched T.V. and yea the next couple hrs arent important so...yea, but now I'm on the phone with Kevin and Maria which I have been for a couple hrs now. Kinda funny how you can stay on the phone for so long and talk about nothing. Hah, being a teenager is confusing experience.  piece.
