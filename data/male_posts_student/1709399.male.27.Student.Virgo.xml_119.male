Feel like a Iceman inside an Igloo wearing three layers of Clothing  Socks inside the apartment even while asleep . Its very difficult to get up early in the morning and the whole biological clock is going for a toss . The Outside Temperature at daytime is 12 c compounded by occasional drizzles  chilly winds. The night time temperature has dropped to 5c . Its been a few weeks since I have seen Sun's rays and now I understand why the westerners get excited on seeing the Sun.
