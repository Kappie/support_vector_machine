Otherwise,technically and tactically should be alright~ Trying out "soak and strike" tactics currently tho i dun reallie noe how to start it~ juz trying it out je~ But seems morale pretty low wif low attendance and stuffz~ hope it goes away b4 league wif gd attendances on sundayz~   Hmm...wad else ehz? been a long tym since i blogged~ haiz~ boredz i guez~ no life currently~ juz work,floorball and comp~ NO movies no fun no nuting~ lolz~   The emptiness surrounds me lyk a fog, blinding my vision of the pastures beyond, Beneath me, only a dim shining light guides me along, through a path strewn with trouble meant to pull me down...  Argh! can't even string lines together!! the noise from my sisters shouting,the wretched life i lead on~ haiz~ If this is stress, then my life is a jackass~ zzz~
