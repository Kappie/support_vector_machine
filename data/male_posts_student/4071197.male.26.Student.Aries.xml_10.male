As an example, it discusses how Wal-Mart, on of the larges companies in the world, utilize a centralized IS.     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Some will argue that being locally sensitive while running a centralized information system is impossible. They will their standpoint with tooth and nail claiming that running the IS decentralized is the only valid option for a large, global company. Contending that view is Kevin Turner, Chief Information Officer (CIO) of Wal-Mart, who in an interview with Abbie Lundberg talks about how his company copes with global growth in spite of a commitment to run IS centrally. To Understand how large Wal-Mart really is, consider these facts: last year the company generated more than $256 billion in global revenue, managed almost 5,000 stores in 10 different countries, obtained the services of approximately 30,000 suppliers, and operated 1 (o n e!) information system. According to Turner, “running centralized IS with homegrown, common-source code gives Wal-Mart a competitive advantage and helps the company maintain one of the lowest expense structures in retail”.  Nevertheless, in the article Turner recognizes the difficulties of balancing the advantages of a centralized system with the disadvantages in local flexibility. Therefore, three fundamental philosophies govern Wal-Mart’s IS strategy: “The first philosophy is to run a centralized information system for ... operations all over the world, and ... run that from Arkansas. The second is to have common systems and common platforms. The third is to be merchants first and technologists second.” By keeping the processes and systems almost the same no matter of geographic location, Wal-Mart has managed to drive down costs, become exceedingly efficient, and minimize downtime and start-up time during transition of people. Furthermore, to ensure local flexibility, the company has come up with a model of decentralized decisions but centralized systems and controls. This model bestows people in local markets with a great deal of flexibility, so that they can perform their jobs in the best, most effective way.  Lundberg, A. (2002, July 1).
