I spent most of my lunch time staring at the sky. Now for some people this might seem weird but to me its really relaxing. The last couple of days I had a lot of things in my mind eg: school, grades, future, relationships, family, assignments and hotchicks xD.    Anyways while I was staring up to the clear blue sky ofCanberra I had a think about everything that has happened in my life past and present. I realize that the past and the memory I have with all my friends in Cita Buana means a lot to me. I guess I never knew how I love being in CB. When I left for Canberra I didnt know how much it meant to me. Only now i realize why. My friends and my memory of CB gives me a reason to smile each day. I dont know why the memory of CB and my friends make me smile i guess its justmy happy thought.    Besides thinking about my past i was also thinking about what will happen to me in the future and shit like that. Now ive notice that a lot of people stress about University and what will happen to them after they graduate. A lot of people have asked me what i want to do afterwards, usually i just say " i have no idea ". To me i dont really think of the future that much. Reason is because people now are too anxious to reach their destination whether its getting rich before 25 or just finishing University. But to me i like to just sit back and enjoy the ride life will offer me. I dont care if i go to a top notch University or if i go to some community college. And its because i will enjoy myself every step of the way, till the very end. i dont regret anything and i'll never will. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, its my motto.    Now while I was reminiscing about everything else in my life, I completely lost track of time and I was 15 minutes late for Oz lit. o.O    Here's a great joke I found in :  urlLink   www.jokes.com          A little old lady sits at the luncheonette counter and orders a hamburger. The huge guy behind the counter bellows, "One burger!"   Whereupon the chef grabs a huge hunk of chopped meat, stuffs it in his bare armpit, pumps his arm a few times to squeeze it flat, and then tosses it on the grill.   "That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen," the old lady says.   "Yeah?" says the counterman. "You should be here in the morning when he makes the doughnuts."      Funny stuff xD
