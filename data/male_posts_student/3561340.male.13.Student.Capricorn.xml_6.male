Most of you that are reading this probably know Mike so I'm not going to bother telling you about him. All I have to say is that Mike is awesome. I think that really describes him. Hes getting recruited to Hun for basketball because he knows hell miss me too much and because North guys basketball sucks. Anyways today was pretty much exactly like yesterday so there is no need for me to tell you about it. So thats it. Peace
