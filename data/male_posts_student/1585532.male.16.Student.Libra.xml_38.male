After receiving some post WWII era Macs (no pun intended, seriously, they run 33mhz at top speed), I think these might have been the Nazi Party's secret weapon.  And think about it, its genius!  To develop "boxes" with TV screens and an advanced recording system that somehow plays a series of scenes on the TV screen, fooling the user that they actually bought a working computer!  After a while, the user gets enraged at this machine since it does absolutely nothing.  Also it has eye-burning colors that just suck.  After repeated attempts to operate the Nazi TV Box, the user becomes angry and punches it in the screen, which would electrocute him and he would die.  Now all the Nazis had to do was mass-produce them in a wide variety of colors and sizes, and then to put them onto the market at reasonable prices, and you have the Macintosh corporation.  Pure genius....
