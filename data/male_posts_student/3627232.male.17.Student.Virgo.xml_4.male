Although it wouldn't be anymore boring than now So why do I keep on resisting this urge? Because I pride myself in this little accomplishment Or maybe I'm to tired to sleep Perhaps staying awake will help me dream Like rest for the imagination The longer I'm up, the better the rest And then my dreams will be full and vibrant Not like this very dull reality Or maybe I'm wrong.
