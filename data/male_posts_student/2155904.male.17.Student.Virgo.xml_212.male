He ate breakfast and played a little MVP but then got a game of basketball going up at Cougar Ridge.  Tyke joined up with Maniak, Amed, Tyronious, and Macaroon for some bball and actually some 4-square as well.  But Tyke dominated the basketball games.  He won the 21 games, him and Maniak won the 2 v 3 game, and Tyke won every game but one of bump.  Then at 4-square he did pretty well but it hurt his wrist to hit the ball so much so he retired quickly and went back to shooting around.  Then he and Amed retired to the Russian dwelling to edit the English masterpiece they filmed at Tyke's house on Saturday.  The editing involved a lot of yelling with Amed and his dad, some moments where nothing was going right, and just a lot of tries to get it right.  But really it went pretty smoothly.  The funny thing for Tyke is that he knew some of how to use this software because of his work at KING5 and all of the time he has spent there.  The stuff Amed has is a downsized version of what is used at the station so Tyke had a little hands-on experience with it already.  And thus he was able to do some stuff pretty well.  It was a lot of fun to do and they made the video innumerably times better than it already was.  It was just adequate before, not even all that funny, but now it rocks.  Just sickness.  And it isn't even due until June 10th.  But you should be dying in anticipation to see this.  And now that Tyke has built it up way more than he should have, it will suck.  But that doesn't matter.  Making movies will now be much easier to do.  Especially once Tyke gets his software too.  After editing Tyke met up with his parents in Factoria for dinner at Applebee's.  It was nice and tasty.  And after that they went to Tyke's mom's work to drop off Tyke's brother's car for he is getting back from San Fran (at least that's where Tyke thinks he's at) where he was at a friend's wedding.  Tyke loves driving his bro's mobile.  It is fast, has tinted windows, a sub, good speakers, and is much more comfy than Tyke's car.  Tyke even likes the smell of it.  But now he is back to driving his own car and he has to fill it up tomorrow which means dropping like 25 bucks.  Of his parents' money that is.  Once Tyke got online he was reminded that he is going to a concert tomorrow.  Dashboard Confessional, that's gonna be good.  Of course with Dotti and Purdy.  Tyke was going to go to the Mariners on Wednesday but he sacrificed that in order to go to the concert.  His mom keeps pressuring him about homework and such so he had to play it safe.  It will all work out in the end.  And this week is just going to be so much fun.  School, concert, running, school, speech, school, speech, school, yearbooks, check-in at hotel, prom, laser show, hotel.  Damn, so much to look forward to this week.  Let's just hope it doesn't get too crazy.  Yikes!  This is gonna be cwazay!
