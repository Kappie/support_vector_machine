I answered the call and the conversation is as follows (ill call the telemarketer "clown"):  ME: Hello  CLOWN:Hello ME: Hello  CLOWN:Hello im calling from the xxxxxxx company and i would like to know if you would be interested in our latest offer.  ME: Ok. (being such a nice guy)  CLOWN: Do you own a handphone?  ME: Yes  CLOWN: do you have a prepaid?  ME: Yes  CLOWN: Our company has a new plan. You can get a Nokia 3XXX(forgot the number)camera     phone for free.You know you can take pictures with it.(duh if not why would it be called a camera phone??) All you have to do is pay $29.90 a month.Thats all you have to pay a month. No regis.. bl bla bla bla blaa kukublaaa. You can keep the same number you are using. All i need is your particulars.  ME: Sorry i cannot accept your offer because i have reloaded my phone.(LYING)  CLOWN: But sir we can let you keep your old number.  ME: look im really sorry but i cant accept this offer.  CLOWN: Ok ill let you speak to my supervisor to confirm about this offer.  CLOWN'S BOSS: Hello my name is blablablababalbaaa.ballablabakukublallkukujiau.  ME:Im really sorry but i cant accept your offer.  CLOWN'S BOSS: But you can keep your own number.  ME: But i just reloaded my credit so this offer will be of no use to me.  CLOWN'S BOSS:Sir, your payments for the first three months will be credited.  ME:Sorry but im an international student so i will have to consult with my parents first.  CLOWN'S BOSS: Your an international student??  ME: Yes.  CLOWN'S BOSS: Hold on  The supervisor hands the phone back to clown.  CLOWN: So sir your an international student??  ME: Yes.  CLOWN:So sir are you working??  ME:No  CLOWN:I see. Are you over 18 years of age??  ME: No  CLOWN: I'm sorry sir but it seems that you are not elligible for out offer. So sorry for bothering you.  After this pointless conversation i head down to the bus stop realizing that i just missed the bus by a minute or two.And me being impatient and also due to the fact that the next bus will only pass by 30 minutes later, i decided to walk to the shopping mall. And i tell you that walk lasted me 30 minutes. This all the fault of that silly telemarketer. If that brainless person would just have checked with the phone company for particulars or something then this stupid conversation would not have taken place. But one thing is for sure this clown sure is relentless. He would probably do anythig  to sell his products. Probably would burn buildings down and sell his own family just to sell his junk.Well the lesson learnt is just say "NO, Not Intersted!!" and hang up the phone before he drags you into a pointless conversation.
