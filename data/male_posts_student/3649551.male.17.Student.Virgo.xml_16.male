Don't you know, if it's not on KLUV or KLOV or whatever it is, it's not Christian music? God cannot be praised with distorted guitars and any amount of bass! Neither can Christian music focus on anything other than how wonderful and holy God is. How about singing about our struggles as humans trying to be like him? What about directly and honestly addressing topics of sin through music? You know what it is: it's that mistaken modern Christian stance of isolationism. We'd rather not think about the lost or anything unpleasant about life. Forget real struggles. We'd rather pretend that everything is all right, everything is great, everything is perfect. 'God will take care of us.' And then we act surprised when people doubt God's purpose because he allowed them to suffer. Hello?! If we convince ourselves that God is going to step in and protect us from all suffering, of course we're going to be pissed when he doesn't rescue us from the normal pains of life. At times like those, we like to forget that we all have free will and that our suffering is due probably to a choice of ours, or a choice of another human. We like to forget that if God stepped in and prevented every wrong thing from happening, we'd be mindless zombies who simply exist and obey. We also arrogantly assume that any suffering we go through will not be outweighed, in the end, by good. Growth does not take place in comfort: growth is always uncomfortable. It's like working out at the gym - it really doesn't feel good when you're sore, but you know that you'll be stronger for it. We also forget that we have no idea what we have been protected from. Think of it this way: for every bad thing that happens to you, there is an infinite number of bad possibilities that  could  have happened to you. We simplydon't knowwhat we've been spared. There's a lot deeper material to discuss when it comes to suffering, but I'm feeling far too lazy to do it any justice. I think I'll leave it here for now. I hope people read this stuff and think about what they believe on the subject. These posts are worthless unless they inspire some thought in readers. Don't be so foolish as to think that I've got my crap together on these subjects.
