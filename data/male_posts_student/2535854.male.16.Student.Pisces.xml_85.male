Anyway lost my Beruang shirt..bloody hell...at least I didn`t lose my boots like Farouq the other day...And hahaha those Harimau marchers have to wear some weird skirt like thing made from Tali Raffia...heh...hahaahahah 1Selandand(farouq),1Beruang(me) and 1Helang(sharil) were doing a Harimau`s work..Heh we were opeing up the string and also making it into smaller strands during the last period of accounts since it was so boring...learned the part being taught in Francis already...hmm hahaha the whole class rearranged again for Sejarah and the 'hardcore' students..muahahahaha Zainul hardcore..hahaha..I passed..66 I belive...my paper was the 1st on top when I went to get one of the papers distributed that I didn`t get...How ironic..and there was also a chemistry test today which I`ll faila nd be lucky not to get Zer0 if I get higher than that!  Anyway no regarding the title of my entry..its about hmm Raimie and Alia...they broke up on Saturday according to her...I suspected something had happened cause Najat posted up some bullentin board notice and included Alia in the contents at the bottom about 'a shoudler to cry on' but didn`t state the reason for it...anyway talked to her...She said he was bored or something and left her for another girl appearently and I think I know who...He was the Assunta Leo Club IU Nite with a girl..Suwannee..from Sri Hartamas...I belive shes 1year older..very pretty..has a nice smile and a nice voice..Dumb idiot raimie...he told me he was bored like 2weeks ago of the relationship and wanted to break up but I didnt think he was serious and sitting next to him at Assunta and seeing him and Alia smsing eachother they seemed to really love eachother...I feel a bit guilty cause when I told her abt he wanted to breakup earlier she said I shoulda told her and she said she`d have told him off...but I dunno...me and Rai go back a long long way..he`s one of my oldest friends that I still hang around with and still mix or contact around with...Though how long ive known him in comparisen to Alia is at a very big difference...I can`t understand this...real jackass...he really made ehr think he was sweet and blah..I need to have a tlak with him..I`m Disgusted.  Disgusted,Riz.
