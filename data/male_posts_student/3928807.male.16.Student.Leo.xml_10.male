Still good to study it though. Last night, I went to Max's house - a bunch of other people came too, and we smoked Darren's weed and then AJ bought a shitload of weed but they smoked most of it after I left, because I had to go at 12:30. It turns out Taylor has a job at Starbucks. I really am the only person who doesn't have a job (besides my brother). I hope I get a job at Earl Bales. That would be pretty nice. I havent done anything today except eat and listen to music and read the guide, but it's beengood- it's been relaxing.   I was just wondering earlier if Sam is actually a big enough asshole not to tell me if Earl Bales leaves a message on his phone. I've been thinking and I think he might be. He's a spiteful and jealous bastard.   Tomorrow, Darren may come over with his good pal Mike, whoI actually like hanging with. Or he might come over on Sunday. I'm home alone with my brother all day so that leaves open lots of possibilities... possibilities revolving around alchohol and drugs. I don't get to partake in these things often, so I take an opportunity when I can get one. I have to go take a shit now, so maybe I'll post again tonight.
