Today, I avoided my math teacher such that I'll probably have this test that I might have taken today (that everyone else took yesterday) tomorrow instead, or maybe even Friday.  I made it so I could take this French test, which my class took yesterday, on Friday.  And here's the kicker, the big tamale, the shiznit (which reminds me, Graham was pretending he was gonna act gangsta to the judge at the state championship trial, so he was like, "Yo Hona, would you be down if I entered this shiznit?"): today I sweet-talked my way from a 49% final chemistry grade to a 95%.  Try and beat that.  The rest of today is looking pretty sweet too; an all-new Mock Trials, an all-new The O.C., and an all-new Law  Order.  Wednesday is officially my favorite day of the week.  And now, for your reading pleasure, the following is the short story I wrote for English.  The assignment was to write about us looking at someone's hands, what they suggest about the person, and have them say something to you at the end.  I don't know, ask Ms. Kranes where she gets this stuff.  Oh, and at the top is supposed to be our initial, separate description of their hands.  Enjoy.    Ideal Cogs    His hands are effeminate, thin, and bony.  A pale yellow covers them uniformly.  They have long, narrow fingers, with nails that extend just a bit over his fingers, with scarcely any tips.  His skin is smooth and soft, hairless and without much muscle.  He has two scars, one on each hand, small but visible.  	I sit in my history class, trying to force myself to think about World War I.  Ms. Heidlage has assigned us to work with partners in preparation for the test on Monday.  She paired me with Loren, next to whom I sit every history class, with whom I have talked an average of five times a week for the past two years.  Good job, Ms. Heidlage, this will really get me thinking about the Great War.  	Glancing up from my teacher (who is ordinarily a fantastic educator)'s vague study guide, I look at Loren, who intently regards his own sheet.  Grasping it with his left hand, he scans the document with his right-hand index finger.  His digits are long and thin, typical of his entire body.  These fingers are not made for manual labor; they are made for schoolwork, bureaucracy, business - suitable for the business-law course his mother decided he would take.  I notice two scars on each of his hands, minor, boyhood scrapes indicating that school has not vanquished all remnants of his playful childhood days.  As he turns to the back side of the page - gently, delicately, using only what force is needed for the task at hand - I notice the effeminate smoothness of his skin.  Roughness finds no place here; neither do the hair and muscle characteristic of large, masculine hands.  Loren scratches his nose, and I see that his fingernails extend just beyond the ends of his fingers, with practically no white section, serving their explicit purpose with no need for addition.  With his right hand, he scribbles a reminder on the side of his paper, and I cannot help but note their color, pale but distinctive yellow.  The fact that he is Asian, Chinese (though he hails from New Hampshire) is impossible to neglect; so are all of the cultural and disciplinary differences included therein.  	Loren is a student, this is clear.  The look of his hands was for the most part predetermined at birth, but they still reflect his status as the product of his environment.  Loren, though not unknown to revelry, has been shaped by his family and by his schools to become the worker they desired.  His hands, tools to him like he is a tool to his society, show aptitude for accomplishing just the job required, yielding the maximum result with the minimum deviation.  Loren's genes may have determined the structure of his digits, but his world decided what they would be trained to do, what instincts he should learn.  We are a people that values efficiency and dexterity in this modern age over the ruggedness and creativity held so highly in times of yore and glory.  We, the people, found ideal cogs for this system in Loren's hands.  Inevitably, I compare his lot to my own, wondering how much this has proven true in my case.  	Loren puts his paper down onto his desk, setting his pen beside it.  Seeing that I am looking at him, he takes this opportunity to ask something we may have to know on Monday.  	"Alex," he questions apathetically, "I forget.  Who was Mustafa Kemal again?"  	I say to myself, back to the drudgery of school, back to this place that produced the very same cycle in which Loren is trapped and in which I may be doomed to fall.  	But dammit, who the crap was Mustafa Kemal?  [THE END]
