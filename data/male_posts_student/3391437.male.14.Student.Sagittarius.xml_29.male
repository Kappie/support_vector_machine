If someone wants to be a better person, he/she should believe in themselves, should do what theirs hearts tell them to do, should be loyal, responsible and disciplined. To be better you have to do better work. Hard work is the only answer for progressing towards being a better person. Suppose, if you are doing poor in school you should try to do your best. If you try hard, the title “better person” will come flying toward you.
