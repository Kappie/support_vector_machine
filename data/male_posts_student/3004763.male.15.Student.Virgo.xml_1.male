I mean its great to have them but I want to take them online. But here is the upside I have a income tax check coming in the next few week and then I will be on line and I will be the happiest person in the world. I mean what is the best way for me to sit in my room for eight hours and talk trash to some one in New York I mean what else would I want to do. Well I gotsta get rollin
