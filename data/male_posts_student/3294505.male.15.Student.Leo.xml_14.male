Check that out  urlLink here.  Anyways...I hate the guy. Joe, that is. He's a dipshit ignorant asshole, always lying. Not that kinda liar where it's like, slanderous, but, like, the kinda guy who's like OMGWTFBBQOLOLZ I SAW THIS GUY LIKE HAVE A HEART ATTACK AND HIS HEAD BLEW UP YOU TOTALLY BELIEVE ME...... Yeah. And you can never tell when he's joking and when he isnt all "olol anus". So Jonny better not believe Joe.  Anyways, again, I'm just sitting here, bored out of my mind, with music on. I saw SLC Punk today, and its already one of my most favorite movies ever. That shit is so fucking hardcore. You hafta check that out.  I'm totally Heroin Bob.     He never did drugs a day in his life, but he's still such a stoner.
