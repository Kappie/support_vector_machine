I ordered chinease food I was home alone and had about 30 bucks from yesterdays trip left over so I used 9 dollas exactly.  I called and the lady asked me where I lived (of course a chinease lady) and then she said near CMW high school and I said yes and then she was like "okai" in her little chinease voice then she paused and said okay so you live in the high school?  I was like laughing at that point and said no and she said do you want it delivered to the high school?  I said no lol. So she finally said so you live in a hous....right?  And I told her yes after about 5 minutes of debating weather I lived in a house or a school she finally said have a nice day and hung up then after 45 minutes of sitting there starving the guy came, he smelt like old feet....I didnt give him a tip.  I forgot sorry.  Then I ate and enjoyed my food, tomorrow is OBX it is going to be ausome. I cannot wait. Cya.
