I just wrote what ever came to my mind. =P  Sarah, Warren, Paun Ying, Patsy and I. We went to NUS today. To interview Professor Hew Choy Leong. Oh man, he's one cute man. lol~ He commented that i was too serious. =P Ya. Squeezed out as much information from him as possible. Grabbed a few magazines and stuff. He even gave us a VCD! Gonna watch it later. Ya. To think we bought only a cup for him. =P Oh ya. Paun Ying and I rehearsed and rehearsed b4 our interview. lolx~ It was great fun.  Hhmm. Gonna catch some sleep.
