    
       Because of popular demand, I have transcribed my journal from Tanzania, and presented it below.  Enjoy.    Tanzanian Travel Journal: Abridged Version    June 26 : It was build-up day today, at the Charlestown Boys  Girls Club.  The rest of the people have been generally alright.  I’ve managed.  I can tell that the trip will be annoying --- my mother has to bring more stuff tomorrow and my pack is already stuffed to capacity --- but somehow, I’ll get by.  In fact, the only thing (other than that Californian woman) that’s really bothering me is that I can’t quite remember Melody’s address, other than that it’s on Anthony Rd.  For her postcard, I mean.   June 27 : I am in better spirits today.  We left the Boys  Girls Club, “trekked” to the T, and departed from Logan.  Last night’s sleep was nebulous; it represents the primary object of my pessimism for the month.  That, and the group meetings, which waste  much  more time than they ought to.  Otherwise, things are going well.  I wish, though, that one of my friends had come; the others are alright but there’s no one with whom I particularly want to talk.   June 28 : Again, I am writing from a plane.  There’s so much grandeur in flying.  True, airplanes are just as big as they need to be, and most of us have plenty of experience riding in them.  Nevertheless, the sweeping, penetrating sensation of lift, the views of miniaturized civilization below --- in this case, Nairobi, an unstructured yet continuous sea of lights at night --- and the spectacle of the ascent through the clouds, has few peers.  The only thing that compares in terms of stark, yet majestic, impact, for me at least, is that caused by Melody’s beauty.  Which reminds me: every time I travel with groups from North, I always seem to end up sitting next to girls I like.  On the way back from France, it was Madi; on the way back from Orlando, it was Steph (the result of  mutual interest in cards and other parlor games); on the way to Nairobi from Zurich, it was Sarah.  It’s sort of weird that I was made to sit there by Wilson, who wanted Charlie to sit next to him, and what the situation turned out to be.  Even so, I was asleep or lethargic for most of the flight.  Despite the ship’s having sailed, I still feel as if I squandered, or at least failed to capitalize upon, an opportunity.  Well, I have a month, though the only thing I accomplish may be to satisfy my own inconstant desires.   June 29 : We arrived in Dar es Salaam last night, and today we took an eight-hour bus ride to Moshi.  My health has been less than perfect, and Christine has been a real bitch.  Discomfort is proving the scourge of this trip, though.  Not to sound whiny, but sitting in a stuffed, cramped city bus with sixty-pound packs and my limbs contorted to impossible positions in fantastic humidity, is not my cup of tea.  There have been a few rewards, however.  The mountains jutting out of the flat Tanzanian landscape into the clouds provides a natural complement to African culture and poverty.  I’ll have to focus on these things if I’m going to get by.   June 30 : Today was very cool.  In the morning, I hung out with Marisa, Kathryn, and Meng on the hotel balcony.  It was relaxed and fun, and my opinion of all of them improved.  That’s what vacation should be like --- just sitting around, chatting, watching the quiet bustle of an exotic area.  Later, I had an extraordinarily long discussion with Tim, a physicist/med student from Iowa.  He was koolio.  We talked about  everything , from health-care reform to the Pentateuch.  In the afternoon, we took the bus to the Primary School Kimbushi outside Moshi.  The sights were certainly worth seeing.  The strange style of a rural African village resembled nothing I’ve encountered in the past.   July 1 : It was fun again today.  We played with the kids here at Kimbushi for six or seven hours.  Tiring, but interesting.  I played frisbee and soccer --- very intense.  I talked to some kids, and longer to this twenty-one-year-old who wants to become an accountant in Uganda.  I think Wilson knows I like Sarah.  He said that he could picture us together.  Whatever, it doesn’t matter anymore.  And who wouldn’t like her?  She’s such a sweetheart.   July 2 : Today, we did some cement stuff for the school.  Later, we took a tour of the village --- fun.  I rapped.  Wilson got mad when I used the word “nigga” in the Biggie part of “Runnin.’”  Not much else to note, other than that the twenty-one-year-old’s name is Dominic (I taught him to play Bataille Corse), and this kid gave me his address for pen pal business.   July 3 : Another alright day.  We did some work (a lot of heavy lifting).  I’m on budget now, with Charlie.  It’s fun.  I lent my watch to this kid who wanted to keep track of football --- big mistake.  I still haven’t found him, unless that boy lied to me.  It’s weird how little kids crowd around me whenever I want to sit down.  Otherwise, last night (after I wrote in my journal) had that Rockport-at-night excitement.  I saw Mt. Kilimanjaro for the first time; it was very impressive.  Laura and I joked that the two of us could just hang out at the bottom for a week, playing cards.  In the tent, Ben, Josh and I made couplets about are team members.  I promised I’d write them down, so here they are:  	Alex hates our leader Christine. 	He says she’s a bitch, and she’s just plain mean.  	Wilson won’t shut up about the BBC, 	Maybe ’cause he gives it to Mokriski.  	Up in Kimbushi is where we stayed. 	Meng wanted sushi; instead she got laid.  	A thousand shillings is worth a buck. 	Yesterday, Sarah Blanks was able to fuck.  	Josh was mad about his sleeping-bag liner. 	Sarah’s fine, but Melody’s finer.   July 4 : We left Kimbushi, and traveled by Land Rover back to the hotel in Moshi.  Last night, I had an hour-long discussion with the girls “while washing dishes,” during which I revealed who I thought was pretty on the team (Maggi, Julia, and Sarah), and it slipped in that I liked Melody.  I also recited the rhymes from the night before.  The guys were mad at me, but whatever.  Tonight, we went to a barbecue at a country club.  Sarah, Ben, and Mr. Jobe are awesome at ping pong.  After a chili contest, we watched the European Cup (soccer), which was Greece vs. Portugal.  I was rooting for the latter the entire time --- I always root for the red-jerseyed players --- but Greece’s defense was just impenetrable.  I’m also sick, by the way; I have a sore throat.  Plus, I wrote a long letter to Melody today.  Awww.  Off to bed.   July : I saw Tim again in the bar, but we didn’t have much time to talk.  We went by bus to Longido, or maybe this place is called Arusha.  Damn, this pen’s running out of ink.  The campsite here is really African-looking, but it still has fairly definite boundaries.  I hate having boundaries, be they physical or mental, like having to do homework or whatever.  This trip is one big boundary.   July 6 : Now I’m using Charlie’s pen.  It writes too fatly.  In any case, we walked to a Maasai village today.  On the way, I had this big damnable nosebleed.  Sucked.  The Maasai were alright I guess.  The smell was annoying, and there were flies everywhere.  I really miss food.  Hiking up Longido and then Kilimanjaro is going to be such a pain.  I didn’t mind the ionized water before, but now it bothers me.  Bitch bitch bitch.   July 7 : We hiked from the campsite to another one on Longido mountain.  Another damn nosebleed in the beginning.  Christine isn’t actually  that  bad.  The hike lasted several hours.  It was tiring, but I could get through it.  Lunch (cashews and bread with peanut butter) was very satisfying.  I use the verb “to be” way too often in this journal.  Even so, I had serious second thoughts about climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro.  I keep going back-and-forth about it.  True, we’ll go slowly, take lots of breaks, and carry only our daypacks; but the altitude presents an enormous problem.  Supposedly, you run out of breath every ten steps, and it feels like you’re wearing a pack when you’re not.  Man, I want to go home.   July 8 : We climbed Longido.  It was very long and tiring, but it wasn’t really too bad.  Especially since after my daily (fucking) nosebleed, the porters helped me with my stuff.  Wilson got mad at me, but whatever, fuck him.  I wonder if that could be a medical excuse to forego Kilimanjaro.  Again, back-and-forth on that.  Then I went up ahead with one of the guides.  That was nice, but again, that fucker was angry with me.  Christine was distracted, though, by Bailey.  From what I gather, she was hyperventilating and couldn’t feel some of her limbs.  On the truck thing, Christine used the EPIRB (Emergency Positioning Indicator Radio Beacon), and we’re sleeping in these rooms in Longido.  I taught Maggi this meditation thing I do, and later we discussed politics at dinner.  She’s cool.   July 9 : Leader-pen.  We went to the Maasai market in the morning; I got a statue thin of a seated warrior and a small shielf for $37 and $5, respectively.  I think the statue will go in the dining room and the shield I’ll hang from my wall or door.  I’ll probably get a necklace or something in Zanzibar for my mother I’ve gotten pretty good at haggling --- you have to explain how shoddy the item is and how awful their price is at every step.  I did big budget bottom-line and redistribution stuff on the bus; that was satisfying.  A lot of this trip is really nice, especially the scenery.  It’s the hassle that irritates me, evidently.  Tonight my leadership began, and I’m hoping I can prove myself (but I don’t know how much I can do sitting on a Jeep looking at animals).  Two-week mark!   July 10 : We went on safari at the Lake Manyara National Park.  The Jeep group was OK (especially the food part), it was moderately cool to stand up and look out the top, and the wildlife was alright.  The most interesting were these little monkeys we saw at the end.  They use their hands so much as we do, so humanly.  Anyway, I did prove myself --- to be a crappy leader.  I disagreed with most of what people said during the critique, though.  They wanted me to know what was going on but didn’t like when I asked questions; they wanted me to make announcements but didn’t listen when I did.  One thing was said with which I completely agree, however: I didn’t care about leadership.  I don’t care about this team.  That’s not why I decided to do this.  Teamwork sucks.   July 11 : Safari at the Ngorongoro Crater.  Lots of animals --- elephants, zebras, hippopotamuses, wildebeests, etc., but truthfully not more exciting than an Omnimax movie (like the Australia one).  People in the group, especially Maggi, were angry with me at dinner tonight because of my apathy.  Too bad, I’ll enjoy what I want to enjoy and whether I care about teamwork is nobody’s business.  She (Maggie) apologized a few minutes ago, but then I heard her changing her mind to Wilson.  Moving right along, today is the halfway point of the trip!  Below is a list of things I should do when I get back to Newton so I won’t forget:  -cut my hair -watch “Garden State” -go to Rockport -develop film -watch “Spider-man 2” -birthday party (combination) -listen to music -watch TV -eat Bertucci’s pizza -talk to friends (incl. Richie) -play “Super Smash Bros.” -get school supplies -do AP US Ids -study Spanish -eat teriyaki chicken -bathe -call Melody -update blog -get new watch -iBook? (library) -cut nails -watch “Attack of the Clones” and “Gladiator”   July 12 : After an indoor “picnic” at Lake Duluti at which I saw cute cats that reminded me of Hanne, we returned to Moshi.  I had an emotional confrontation with Wilson and them.  I think I’m just sick of being around these people  constantly .  I need some time to myself.  I got a little today when I was reading a magazine in my room.  I think I’ll be able to stick with it for another two weeks.  Never will I buy into the phony World Challenge ideology, though.   July 13 : A fairly relaxed day in Moshi.  I spent a combined total of forty-five minutes at an internet café adjacent to the hotel, e-mailing George and Richie (responding to their e-mails) and updating my blog even though only really pathetic people will read it.  I’m considering asking for an iBook for my birthday (in addition to a replacement watch) so I can do more homework at the library.  Adam Katz, a world traveler staying at the hotel, said it was useful, and his is really light.  Anyway, I thought of things about which to think on Mt. Kilimanjaro: improving the house, social structures of my family, and my own work habits under my upcoming Reign of Terror.  In the evening, the guys pulled a prank on me, pretending I had left the key in the room, the hotel had locked it, and that Ben hurt himself getting in through the window.  I could have figured it out in retrospect (there were a few aspects that didn’t make sense), but it was alright and they said I proved myself in “caring for the team.”  Exactly two more weeks.   July 14 : After some brief uniform/Will Woodstock business, we bussed to the Rongai Gate.  I got a bunch of snacks: enough for eight biscuits, one Snickers, and some Twix Miniatures each day.  I’m still unsure about the climb; my daypack is now much heavier than my big pack, I’m not taking Diamox, and it’s already somewhat cold (although it  is  nighttime).  I’m also very bad at forcing myself to drink water.  So far I’ve drunk as much as 1.5 liters in a day, and we’re supposed to have 4-6.  I’ll just have to wait and see.   July 15 : Day one of seven on Kilimanjaro.  Very easy climb; just three hours.  The only annoying thing was having to bear the weight of my daypack since I have to carry the rope.  Also, I could only drink a little over a liter of water.  I don’t think I really need it that much; so I gather from certain bodily indications.  Snacks are a lot more useful.  I haven’t followed through with my plans for that about which to think; I’ve been too drowsy to think anything but songs (mostly Phil Collins) and snack/water distribution.  I did have one idea, though: I should e-mail my parents in Zanzibar telling them to order a certain watch so I’ll have it when I get back.  Anyway... that’s it.’   July 16 : Day two of seven; three weeks in.  Another fairly easy climb.  I’ve started to have very slight headaches.  It’s unbearably cold at night.  We played a fun personality game.  It was revealed that I see myself as a koala, cute and humble; others see me as a lazy, funny, happy-go-lucky lemur; I would through away the “Styrofoam cup” of marriage; I would deny death as a reality; and I would ignore sex and keep going.  I don’t know how much weight to put on it; it’s just entertainment.   July 17 : Day three of seven; ten days left in the trip.  Yet another easy climb.  Today was supposed to be our “rest day” (you have one every three days), but I don’t see how the hike was any different from the others.  Still no altitude effects other than very, very slight headaches; and I was out of breath a couple of times, but they weren’t too unusual.  The food prepared by the porters is largely the best food I’ve had on this trip.  I’m stockpiling Snickers for the summit day and the day after.  Man, the summit day’s going to be a bitch.   July 18 : Day four of seven.  An easy climb again, except the acclimatization hike was awfully steep.  I’ve successfully hoarded my Snickers such that I’ll have two per day for the next (and last) three days.  Food really helps on hikes.  Gatorade powder also made the water a lot more drinkable; I have to remember to get some of that tomorrow.  Although trekking is tedious, there have been rewards.  The stars, especially those in the Milky Way, are clear, bright, and beautiful.  Better than Rockport.  I anticipated seeing the cloud cover from above, but it amazes me every time I notice it while hiking.  The experience of being able to see it when I’m on the ground is like nothing in my past.  It makes up for all the hassle of this trip, such as just now when Christine lectured me about joining in with the rest of the team.  I held my own.  I didn’t say it (I didn’t want to aggravate the situation), but after twenty-three days of living in poor conditions with fifteen other people and virtually no time to myself, and with a few of them trying to be brutally offensive to me most of the time, I am not going to make an effort with these kids I can’t stand anymore.  And no, I doubt I’ll regret it.   July 20 : Day six of seven; one week left; Jonny’s birthday; thirty-fifth anniversary of the moon landing; summit day!  Two nights ago, I was chosen by popular demand (the alternatives were Meng, Kathryn, and Marisa) to be the summit leader.  After a long, so-so trek to the Kibo Huts and Steph, a Briton with World Challenge who went on the training mission in Connecticut, we had a three-hour “nap,” which served only to tire us yesterday.  We awoke at 11:00, and Charlie had to enter a hyperbaric chamber because of dizziness.  Then, we had a hellish-though-freezing and oxygen-less (my first major damage from altitude) for seven hours in the dead of night.  We went to Gilman’s Point, then did a fairly easy walk to Uhuru Peak, where I lost a mitten.  The summit was not at all satisfying.  Just the fact that I climbed the highest mountain in Africa.   July 21 : Day seven of seven.  Finally, back to civilization after an extremely tedious hike down (around eight hours).  My lips are seriously chapped.  The tops and bottoms are brown and they hurt when I move them.  I hope they’ll heal soon.  At least we’re back in the city, in Moshi.  Tomorrow, we’ll take a nine-hour bus ride to Dar es Salaam, then a two-hour ferry to Stone Town in Zanzibar, then a who-knows-how-long transportation to our hotel, the Shehe Bungalow.  I had better be able to sleep on the bus; wake-up’s at 4:45 AM.  Just a few days of rest and relaxation, then it’s back to Massachusetts.  Oh, and I noticed something on the bus ride to Moshi: we were under the clouds again.  Somewhat constricting, somewhat saddening; but I wouldn’t want to return up there any time soon.   July 22 : A day taken up almost entirely by transportation.  Some of it was, admittedly, interesting, such as when a bird hit the bus windshield and it shattered and fell in.  While we were waiting for the ferry in Dar, I felt strong anger against the team and longing to come back home as soon as possible.  However, now that we’re in a really touristy part of Zanzibar, the last three substantive days might not be so bad.  I wish I could do more of my own thing than what Charlie and Wilson and them plan to do; like visit the internet café, change money, and buy gifts/souvenirs (or as this hotel calls them, souvigneers).  Even so, the Amaan Bungalow is very nice; I think I’ll be able to survive the last little stretch.   July 23 : Today in Zanzibar was fairly relaxing.  Beside meals, we walked on the beach for several hours.  It is picturesque, but not too enjoyable.  It’s times like this, when it’s supposed to be really fun, that I miss my independence the most.  I did get to hang out by myself in a few instances, though, such as a total of an hour at the internet café (I e-mailed my family and updated my blog), and a while of reading The Economist while eating bread and Nutella.  Which reminds me, not only should we start making crêpes at home, we should also make smoothies using yogurt, bananas, orange juice, and ice.  We’re going to Stone Town tomorrow; I hope I’ll be able to find some good gifts.  Otherwise, I think I’ll buy a necklace and perhaps a bracelet from one of the Maasai stands here.  So close...   July 24 : Last night, the assholes bound me to my bed with duct tape; since then I’ve been thrown into the ocean and pulled a prank on in which I was tricked into thinking I had drunk an alcoholic daquiry.  The last one was alright, but the others make going home all the sweeter.  It was actually pretty fun in Stone Town today.  I bought the rest of my gifts.   July 25 : I wrote a rap about the trip; I think it’s pretty good, especially compared to my other stuff.  Today was our last full day in Tanzania.  It was nice.  There was a fairly brief argument about whether the adults should get a cut of the extra money, but that didn’t spoil things too much.  At dinner, Christine delivered a speech about how we were growing and transforming, and gave us polliwogs, along with our Kilimanjaro certificates.  Kerry chose Edwards!  I’m so happy, but that probably happened like three weeks ago.  I miss the news.  Well, I won’t be without it for much longer.   July 26 : This will be my last entry in this journal.  I am writing on the plane home, from Dar es Salaam to Nairobi to Zurich to Boston.  Earlier today, we took a brief flight on a “puddle-jumper” from Zanzibar.  The flights so far, as well as the bus ride and the nine-hour layover in Dar, were calmer and less irritating than I expected.  Back in the cabin, I have the feeling of the return from Orlando of the (semi-)victorious Newton North High School Mock-Trial Team.  It’s as if nothing has changed since May.  On the other hand, this expedition has satisfied me.  Notwithstanding its overwhelming annoyances and deprivations, the trip had a net gain in terms of enjoyableness and exposure in exciting, alien situations.  The most amazing physical and visual experience --- and that about which I have the most opportunity to brag --- was climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro.  Otherwise, the culture and people of this developing country may have served to give me new political, economic, and worldly perspective, or not.  In any case, I did learn a few new principles, and not only a different method of halting bloody noses.  One: a standard for determining my attraction to girls.  I noticed a while ago that whom I like is largely determined by whom I’m near.  In France, for example, I swooned over Madi since she was the only girl I liked and was with on a daily (more or less) basis, even though I still theoretically liked Sarah and hadn’t ruined my chances with her yet.  After that, since I liked Sarah more, I naturally went back to her (the “Fog of War” fiasco), though the Madi situation was left somewhat ambiguously.  Yet, on this trip, when I was with Sarah (whom I still like, though admittedly not as much as before since the ship sailed), there were instances when i was made aware of her cute behavior, but these times, it was different.  For in each instance, I wasn’t simply attracted to Sarah; I noticed Sarah and immediately thought of Melody.  I thought of how Melody, in the same situation, would be cooler and more “voluptuous” (the word she’s fond of using).  In other words, every moment I was attracted to Sarah, I was attracted to Melody more.  The reason for the lack of this Melocentrism during the France trip must lie in my general repression of thoughts about her while she and Loren were (officially) together.  It’s not that I hadn’t “discovered” Melody then; I remember talking to Steph about it before that.  I’m unclear about this because, as a result of the repression, “records from the early days are incomplete.”  So, this could mean two things.  First, that I’m really in love with Melody despite something of an effort to cease it.  Second, alternatively, that I have grown, and this attraction-without-proximity is a sign of my increasing monogamy.  Nevertheless, this is not to say that my relationship with Melody cannot continue as it has been: non-romantic.  Anyway, on to the other lesson.  Two: I have come to understand the true value of my independence.  By far, the most infuriating aspect of this trip was the team, as a team.  I am not, nor have I ever been, a team player.  I am a human being, and I refuse to consider the fifteen other human beings with whom I have lived for the last thirty days as any single, invented entity.  When I am part of a group, I lose some part of myself.  This makes itself evident by the tangible, actual inconveniences I have suffered throughout the month.  When I cannot decide my own path, the path inevitably leads the wrong way.  Forgetting the messages of history, the fundaments of democracy, civil rights, and the free market, I have learned for myself that without determination of self, what’s determined is hell.
