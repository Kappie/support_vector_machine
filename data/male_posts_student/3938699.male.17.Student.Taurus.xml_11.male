Cooper, Thompson, Hartman, etc.  The only insult for cooper is poopers cooper, which was uttered by Alice McDonald, only because everything she says needs to be accompanied by one.  Because all she says is s**t basically.   So this big black lady goes, 'hey bryan... uh, honeycomb?  Uh, honeysomething?'.  I hate myself.  And i'm putting up all these clothes that belong to people with freaking awesome last names.  I'd give an arm and a leg to have names like some people have: Valore, Machines, Terranova.  Freaking awesome names.     I am forced to live in perpetual angst and self hate...
