He's one of those snooty New York types who looks down on middle America.  Scroll down to the second piece to see the specific Passion comments.  Here's his review of the Passion, and it is full of anger and hatred for the movie.    "I saw "The Passion" at midnight last night in Los Angeles, since neither Newmarket nor Gibson's people would accommodate me with a press screening. Never mind, though, it was far more interesting to plunk down $11 at the Hollywood ArcLight and see "The Passion" with a big group. "  Mr. Big Shot had to see it with the massess since Gibson is ignoring the Media Gods, who would shred him even if he offered them his hand in friendship.  Good job, Mel.  ALWAYS make the media pay.  Have you noticed that any media clips of the movie are grainy?  Gibson isn't even providing clips to the media.  They have to go film scenes themselves, up on the screen.  I wonder if this is piracy?  "But the real problem with "The Passion" is that it is graphic beyond belief, and unrelenting. How anyone will be able to sit through this thing is the real mystery. There is blood, blood, everywhere. The violence toward Jesus is sadistic and grotesque. Basically, the entire second half of the film is spent watching Jesus endure physical torture never before seen in a movie. By the time it's done, actor James Caviezel's body is a map of bloody rivers and lakes with craters of flesh excised from his torso."  So now he objects that the crucifixion was brutal?  How can anyone object to the level of violence in the film?  Again, it's like filming Saving Private Ryan but making all the injuries in the Beach Landing superficial, and everyone lives happily ever after.  Or like the lack of pain, blood, and wwounds in the entire LOTR trilogy.  Plenty of people were crucified by Rome.  This is a fairly accurate account of how it was done to VIPs at the time.  I don't understand the objections.
