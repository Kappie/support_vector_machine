School Clothes Shopping Was A Nice Little Challenge, I Started Looking At What Kind Of Stuff Places Had And It Was All Either Gay Stuff, REALLY Preppy Stuff, Or Gansta- I Guess Thats Whats In, ICK! While We Was In Old Navy (Where I Usually Get Alot Of Clothes) I Was Looking Around And Found Jack Shit, One Employee Came Up To Me And Asked 'How Are You Finding Everything Today?', Lets Just Say My Reponse Wasn't Very Nice! All They Had Was Jeans  Crappy Shirts! After I Got Done Shopping For Clothes At The Mall We Went Over To Kohls (Probably Not Spelled Right) And I Got Some More Clothes! After That We Headed Back To El Dorado To Go To Wally World! At Wally World I Got Some Undies (Box Briefs And Boxers For Those Who Want To Know), Socks, And Some Basic School Supplies! It Is Kinda Hard Shopping For School Supplies In HS Since You Don't Find Out What You Need Until The First Day! I Ended Up Just Getting A Notebook, Mechanical Pencils, And Pen- I Already Have A Binder  A Calculator! After That I Came Home, And Here I Am Typing To You! GoodBye!
