(anyway, it was MT, and as you know, i always heck care about my MT teacher) what shock me even more is i got a destinction for my oral... i thought i had screwed up my oral... of course, there were lots of friends that was not satisfied with their results... i hate the feeling when some are glad while some have to be disappointed... especially for those who had put in great effort but still they did not did well... i felt that i do not deserve the A1 sometimes because others had been so diligent but i can say to had done last minute studying and yet pass with flying colours... i hope that they will consider over about retaking at the end of the year and score... shaun they all are strong, i wonder what will i do if i did not got my A1...  k... forget about it, i got a A1 and it's over... fullstop... the feeling of success is always a split of second... now i have to forget about my result and study for my coming Os... by the way, i'm having EL O Level Oral tomorrow... i'll be meeting up with joyce and kellyn later to try to minimise the mistakes that i will make and to achieve the maximum marks that i could...  by doing well in each subject... i a bit closer to my goal... to my promise... whahahahahaha... tomorrow also pam's birthday... get to see her again... but wonder if i'll get to talk to her... we don't seem to have similar topic beside school work... haiz, so sad... "awwww", i can imagine lay lay saying this already... haha... tata~!!!
