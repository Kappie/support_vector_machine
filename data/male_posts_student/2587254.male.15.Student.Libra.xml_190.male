Even though I spent most of the day napping, and just sitting around, it's sometimes good I think to just sit down and just reflect. Today was one of those quiet, reflecting days. So other than sleeping, I still went to church, and then came home, napped, and then afterwards just reflected, ate, then watched some TV. But yeah today I had some thoughts while reflecting/doing my devos that I guess I'll scribble.....er......type out....    Today I read Romans 8 for my devos. While reading it, especially when I read the final few verses, it just really hit me when it says that we are all heirs and co-heirs with Christ, as long as we are his children, and that is obtained through living by the spirit, and not by ourselves. Also in this passage, like much of the New Testament contains, is the constant reminder of the fact that the Holy Spirit is always with us. That is probably one of my most favourite parts of the Bible, the fact that God keeps reassuring you that no matter what, no matter how wrong things can go in this world, that He is always, as the Holy Spirit, in you. Reading this passage today also got me thinking about the serving masters thing that we learned about in HYPE a while back about how we can't serve both God and money. To me it kind of relates, since in the passage it also speaks of how we can't be pleasing in God's eye if we live by a sinful nature, and how we are Spiritually alive when we live by God's ways. So yeah....I guess today was one of those total linkage days in my mind ehehe....    But yeah, that was a lot of my thoughts jammed into one for today. I guess it also goes with the sermon about serving we had I think may have been last week. Definitely wasn't today, as he was speaking of being a "well-watered garden." But yeah, today though wasn't an amusing day, I still enjoyed it, as like I said, I don't mind having some days when I can just sit down in the quiet and think.    I'm not really going to blog about yesterday, as I'm too lazy too, so I'll just say Dave finally paid me back the 15 bucks he owed me from my bus ticket blackmarketing, well not really, and also the wedding reception dinner wasn't bad. So the trip to Toronto wasn't that bad.    And onto today.....    I woke up this morning at 830, got 5 hours of sleep in total last night, and quickly got ready for church. Ate a light meal as I was still sleepy, got dressed and stuff, and then headed out. Picked up Lina, and Jason at his place was still sleeping, so went to service without him this morning.    I had to to the slide shows, since I didn't exactly have them in pristine order, so I had to jump around a little bit with the presentation. Dave Butler led today, and our congregation was probably the largest in weeks.....with approx. maybe 20 of us hahaha. It's so quiet without the UWO students here....so basically just the HYPE kids and a few other people. As mentioned before our topic today was being a "well-watered garden," with the sermon focusing on Isaiah 58.    After the service, headed downstairs, and chatted abit before me and Rebecca helped out with Sunday School today. It was Carol Ma's last day at teaching today, as her family is moving out to Toronto, since Joseph got a job at York U. But yeah, she did do a lot for the CSS, she was probably the person that organized it to it's peak that it is at today, as back when me, Josh, and the others were in CSS it wasn't exactly the best time of our lives. But the kids seem to really enjoy having Carol as a teacher, and she did do a lot for the church, so I'm sure she'll be missed by many of the kids. Today coincedencially with the topic of my rambling before, their focus was on serving today. So the kids learned this through a lesson, and also then through two games. One with ice cream, where one fed the other, and the other they had to put on one another's shoes. Me and Rebecky had to scoop the ice cream, well more of I did the scooping ( Rebecca: "SPOON MY FACE JOE..."   hahaha jokes)  and then me and Rebecca frantically finding a way to put all the ice cream in the fridge without crushing them *we did twice* collasping our pyramid *multiple times,* so in the end we shoved it all in the freezer until the kids were ready. Eventually I'd have to volunteer to be a partner with one of the kids since they had odd numbers, so I partnered up with Andy. He wanted to win, so he sacrificed brain freeze for large gobs of ice cream being shoved in his face, we won that game =P. But for the shoe game, we lost haha. Then while they were cleaning up, me and Rebecky had a conversation on the whiteboard, but yeah.....anyways....hahahaha......yeah........that was pretty much my experience today in helping the CSS =P.    After church, came home, ate, then slept from 3-5.    I was then woken up at 5 from a doorbell. Since dad was downstairs watching TV and couldn't hear the doorbell, I had to grab the door *ugh....loss of sleeping run.* Gavin's dad was at the door and he came to pick up the tents from us, since they are borrowing them for next week when their family and Josh's go camping. So after giving him the tents, I went back to sleep, and then woke up at 7.    After waking up at 7, I did my devos then, and then headed downstairs to eat. Afterwards, chatted on MSN for a bit, ate, showered, milled about, and here I am now....again haha.    Think I'm gonna go watch TV now. Argh....summer's goin' by so quickly. To think that 4 weeks ago we planned the Wonderland trip that is to be next Saturday. Wow...in another 4 weeks, it'll be September....oh well.....enjoy the summer sun while it lasts =).    Anywho I'm out.    Later.
