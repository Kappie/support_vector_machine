People from all over Singapore and Malaysia came for this event. My father decided to drive up. It was the first time that we drove up to Malacca. It is because usually we take the bus.   We left around 1 and arrived at Malacca  around 5 plus. My uncle and cousins also followed us in a different car. Driving along the highway in Malaysia is very nice experience. Seeing all the beautiful scenery-the mountains, large plantaions and forested area. We stopped over about twice. It is because we dont get to see much natural beauty in Singapore  Once, we arrived in Malacca we checked into the hotel that my uncle had booked about month ago. We went to temple later. The next morning, we went to the temple early in the morning. Alot of pilgrims were already in the temple. Slowly, alot of people filled up the temple. People keep on leaving and coming. This event is spread over three days. All of a  sudden it started to rain like cats and dogs. It created a bit of havoc outside the temple. It rained for about two hours. Then, suddenly it became so hot. The weather was even hotter in Singapore. About 37 degrees. Thats damm hot. Can feel your feet burning? We went window shopping at night. Some things in Malaysia are quite expensive especially the branded stuffz. Only the food is cheap and good. The roti john damm shock. The popiah even better. The chendol the best. One of the best chendol i ever tasted.  On the final day, we went to temple for one final time. Said our prayers and went back to the hotel to pack our stuffz and put our stuffz in the car. We relaxed in one of my uncle's room who was leaving on sunday. We left Malacca around 5. Along the way on the highway leading to Singapore, my uncle's car stalled. We were all very worried. His car was towed away to the nearest exit point which was Yong Peng,Johor.The car had to be repaired. My uncle told  my dad not to wait for him and to take his children along. We left him and his wife there to repair the car. We arrived at Singapore around 9.45pm  Overall, the trip was fun as i learned alot of things. I found out that Malaysian drivers are very daring. They like to change lanes,cut here and cut there. They are risk takers.
