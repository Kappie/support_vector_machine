Ricky Williams has never been a conventional NFL star, he wore a wedding dress on the cover of a magazine with Mike Ditka. He is just a little different. Williams has great stats and has a great contract with the Miami Dolphins which would keep him well paid for a long time. So why retire at such a young age ? Why give up the fame and fortune ? Why do something that everyone else says is stupid and waste of talent ?   Because Ricky Williams is human. He wants to spend his time doing things that he enjoys and loves. If he doesnt enjoy playing football, no matter how much it pays him, then he shouldnt play. Its that simple. Its not some complicated difficult decision. Do you want to play ? Yes or no. If yes, then play hard. If no, then go do what you want to do. It is rumored Williams never liked the demands playing in the NFL put on him nor the restrictions on his personal lifestyle. Williams is an admitted pot smoker who has been fined by the NFL for testing positive for marijuana. Last december he tested positive again and was set to incur more fines in the coming months. But Williams made his decision, shaved his head clean of his dreadlocks and boarded a plane for Asia. Williams loves to travel and thats what he is doing.  Now there have been plenty of sports buffs saying that this is a terrible waste, a great young talent who was the heart of his football team. Williams was the most important piece of the Miami Dolphins. And there will be plenty of people, sports fans or not, who will say "Williams is stupid for leaving all that money." or "He cant do anything else, he is best suited for playing football." But the fact remains that he doesnt want to play anymore. Whatever the consequences are of that: living a less lavish lifestyle or not being on TV every sunday from fall to spring; he doesnt feel the desire to play.   I for one admire Ricky Williams for his strength. It takes alot of courage to do what he did. Now I dont agree with the timing of his decision, he really did put his team in a bind because now they are totally screwed. They dont have a decent running back nor do they have time to find one. Had Williams given them some warning maybe the Dolphins wouldnt be so mad bout this. But like i was saying, i applaud Williams' courage to do what everyone else said was a bad idea, or stupid, or a waste. He made a decision and stuck with it. He wasnt going to be talked out of it. Regardless of what any of his friends or family thought or said he made his decision. Now some would say it was selfish of him make a decision despite his loved ones' protest. But how does that make him selfish ? He is entitled to make his decisions and not everyone is going to agree with them. If his mom or dad, brother or sister, friend or girlfriend thought it was a bad idea and Ricky did it anyway therefore he is selfish  ? It doesnt make any sense to me.    Ricky Williams retirement from the NFL is a perfect example of a person doing what they thought would make them happy. Now whether or not Williams stays out of the NFL remains to be seen and if he is truly happy one can never tell. But like i said in an earlier entry happiness only exists in the present. You cant tell yourself that once I get to this point in my life then i'll be happy. You must find happiness in your everyday life and if you cant, then get some place where you can find everyday happiness and peace. Williams was able to escape from a life that was not making him happy. The millions of dollars, fame and Sportscenter highlights were not things that kept Williams happy. Now maybe for some of us this would keep us happy. Everyone is not going to understand his decision but everyone isnt supposed to. It was Williams decision to make and live with.   I think we all try to live our lives with the idea that we want to be happy. But we perceive expectations from those around us of what type of job we should have or how much money we should make in a year. The fact is that those things are irrelevant if you arent at peace with yourself in your heart. I look at the rich and many of them are drowning in anti-depressants despite their endless money. Prozac, Xanax, and Flintstones Chewable Morphine are all just ways of chemically inducing peace of mind.  Im hoping to find peace of mind without them. I would trade all the money and fame in the world if i could guarantee my peace of mind. I hope I can be strong enough to do what I want without worrying about what others' expectations are of me.   Congratulations Ricky on escaping from a life of meeting others' expectations.  Hook 'em !!
