I have lots of friends that own blogs, their all over the country blogging on their websites, i was talking with my friend Alex who owns a website and we have come up with the idea of a nationally syndicated blog with many different writers, kind of like a newspaper. We're basicly brainstorming now but we need a good name for the website, Alex says "Scattered Brain" would be a cool name, but send me and email with your suggestions.
