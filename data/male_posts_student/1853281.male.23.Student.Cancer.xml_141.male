Totally and unabashedly.  Enough said. Still sad about 12 rods....so here are the Lyrics to a favorite tune of theirs. "the time is right(to be wrong) when you're bored  go steal a bike or two  inhale some gas or glue  freak out your parents  when your lips turn blue   noone will ever know  if you sell all the things you stole  skip class and smoke a bowl  or switch your gender role  cuz don't you know   the time is right (right)  to be wrong  the time is right (right)  to be wrong  feels so good  kinda like it never should  the time is right (right)  to be wrong   kick somebody's ass  then run away real fast  plunge through a pane of glass  rip off your braces  saw off your plaster cast   cuz you're never too young  to make a booty call  or tag a sign or a wall  or even make your enemies  fall, fall, fall   the time is right (right)  to be wrong  the time is right (right)  to be wrong  feels so good  kinda like it never should  the time is right (right)  to be wrong   defy the weather  stay young forever  don't you know you're never gonna die  you know you're never gonna die  don't you know you're never gonna die   so hack into a government mainframe  and launch a bomb  always be where you don't belong  go make yourself a drink  and make it strong   the time is right (right)  to be wrong  the time is right (right)  to be wrong  feels so good  kinda like it never should  the time is right (right)  to be wrong   the time is right (right)  to be wrong  the time is right (right)  to be wrong  feels so good  kinda like it never should  the time is right (right)  to be wrong   the time is right (right)  to be wrong  the time is right (right)  to be wrong  feels so good  kinda like it never should  the time is right (right)  to be wrong
