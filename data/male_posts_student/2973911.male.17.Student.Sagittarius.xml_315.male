They may look financially stable  such (a decent way of living) --- but 3/4ths of America is morally rotting. THey have become so complacent that they have forgotten how important it is to be what makes us different from humans  animals. Respect, Love, Courtesy,  other basic values have been decimated to an "I don't care about you--- you mind your own business" attitude. From my workplace alone, there is no sense of humanity than just thinking of how to make money. Not that I was looking for tsismis, but there was something lacking. Working robots. I say, working robots. That is why  if I had the right amount of time, knowledge  capital, I will not hesitate to move back to our country and start a small business there. It's not about cultural bias but how we most Filipinos, even though we're always suffering from hardships and all kinds of turmoil, know that there is more to life than just material things (Not to say that Americans are--- but most of them do). That's what most of us battle-scarred Filipinos make a rare breed of moral  stable integrity.
