Hope I havn't stopped growing at 16 year old :-O Damn  blast- I need a shave but the batteries are out of charge in the thing. And theres nothing else!  Oh well. If I dont go to Alistars after, I'll have a post right here at 1 AM! I think it's meant to finish at 12:00. 7-12 I think. Meh, who cares...
