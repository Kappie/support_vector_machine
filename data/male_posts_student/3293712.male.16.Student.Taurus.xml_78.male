Me + Chris + Erik continued our search for Wesley Willis CDs, I got a copy of Erik's band's new EP and we went to  Dodgeball . I wasn't expecting much, but I felt it justified my decision to spend $6.50 on it.   I saw a 4 megapixel camera at Best Buy today for only $250, and that struck me as good enough to buy. Four megapixels is actually pretty good. I don't particularly care about technology specifics, so I didn't find out anything else.   Everywhere  we went today seemed to be packed with friends and acquaintances, be it Best Buy or Nisswa or the movies. Hobe and Houley decided to go to  The Terminal , which sucked because I wanted to see that at a later date. Houley didn't want to see  Dodgeball  and it didn't fit with Hobster's precious notions of maturity.   Some jock asshole tried to pick a fight with Chris today at Subway. It was funny because Chris made him look totally stupid. First he said, "I'm going to kick your ass," and Chris said, "What is that going to prove?" As he walked out he called Chris a "fag" and Chris asked him if he was homophobic.  The blog has been boring for the past few days. I don't know if it has been because Jeff returned, or what, but we need some  excitement .  ADITLO to me is kind of a recap of my day, kind of a place to think out loud, and kind of a place to say things that I said during the day but no one was around to hear.  So twenty-ish days have passed this summer, what have we accomplished? I tend to look at summer as kind of a 90 day long version of the movie  The Breakfast Club , where we do things and suffer from some self-identity problems, but at the end we realize we are alright. Tons of fun, but no changes, as far as I can see.   Yeah, but aren't we always on the verge of discovering some important self-truth? It all boils down to when we discover that we either are or aren't alright. If you discover that you  aren't , chances are that you've been listening to too much emo. That is a facet of the complex and shining gem that is my life philosophy. Deep down, chances are that you're cool, and I hope you're cool with that. I know I've beaten the "Do your own thing" deal too much, but it can't hurt to say it one more time. Do your own thing.  I don't have many future plans for this summer. Actually, I am going to write a list right now: Continue to spend money frivolously Attend Warped Tour, heckle sellouts there Keep the fashion revolution rolling Be nicer to my mom (well, I probably won't) Stress the importance of free will and music in my long-winded, self-important blogs Sleep 12 hours a day Heckle sellouts in my hometown and in close towns and townships (i.e. Nisswa, John's house) Get matching "the Casualties: NYC Punk Rock Chaos" lighters with Chris (his white, mine black), start some sort of Casualties Army superhero team where we light them, hold them together, and say "Jorge! Grant us the power to fight sellouts and Guard Dogs!"  Attend other concerts Help bring down the already self-destructing Brainerd Lakes emo scene Remember that every day is historically and personally meaningful, regardless of what I do (or don't do)  I bet I sleep at least 43 days out of the summer. According to the office calculator, 43*24=1032 hours.  So me and Chris started this blues-rock band the other day, with me on "vox" and Chris on harmonica. Basically, Chris riffs while I sing about having the various veneral-disease related blues. It was quite funny, until Erik took the harmonica and threw it in the lake because we were playing "Junk-rot Blues" while he was talking to his girlfriend. Oh, and Chris skitched behind Erik's car while playing the harmonica before this happened.  I was going to say something about the mall, but it is probably too long to post tonight. So I'll get to it some other time, and those who want to comment on the mall can gather their thoughts.  Why are flags still flying at half-mast? Didn't Ronnie's week of mourning end a while ago? I commented on this to the lady at the bank and she gave me a sucker.    Fahrenheit 911  starts playing next Friday. Of course, it won't be playing in Brainerd. I asked the nice Rastafarian fellow at the ticket counter why not, and he said that it wouldn't pull in enough money, and I claimed that the owners of Movies Ten were fascist pigs, and he said that they probably were. When the revolution hits full speed, I'll let him be in charge of movie booking.   I know Michael Moore is a showman who is hungry for attention, but he  is  quite a clever filmmaker. The "Sewer Gremlin," as Chris calls him, brings up valid points and makes entertaining movies. Also, it seems like a long time ago  Stupid White Men  got me into political activism, so I feel in debt to him.  I'm done. See ya tomorrow, or the next day, or in three weeks.
