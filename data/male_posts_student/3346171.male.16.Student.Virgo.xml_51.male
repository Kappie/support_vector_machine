Did i mention that my aunt is coming here today?!! My dad went there(minas gerais), to see her family, and now 3 aunts and a bf of one are coming. VACANCY!!!!! (You guys know what it means. Who doesn't, send me an email), I guess my aunt will have to amput her arm. I feel so bad and sorry, but i'm praying for her to be good and there'd be no need for that.
