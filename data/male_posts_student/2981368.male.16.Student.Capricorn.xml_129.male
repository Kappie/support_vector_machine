He is a legendary little blue bird - have you ever played FIFA 98? where he randomly jumps out on the start intervals and either waves or demonstrates a degree of football control that i did not know was achievable by a small bird.  There was a mascot for Korea japan????? why didnt anyone tell me??? they are typically japanese  i.e. about 10000 years ahead more advanced than anything we came up with, i mean everyone else is still using organic mascots. Go SUPER COOL AWSOME FIGHTING ROBOTS!!!!  HAHA Lativa!!! they they actually dont suck, held the germans to a draw. anyone see the Italy/ Sweden game? 1-1 although the Italians played better, Maldini missed more headers than a 2 inch, headless, deaver form the pharoe islands! Now Italy might not go thru! GO SWEDEN!! GO DENMARK!!! GO BULGARIA!!!  On a slightly more Peruvian note, i went on a bit of an expedition shopping spree and bought lots of drink bottles and assorted tubes, also a waterproof cover for my bag and a nat style bandana (minus the pirate symbols) I have been experimenting with the best way to wear it (there are many) my favorite so far is the "west African malicia fighter" - I named it myself   ~ Adios
