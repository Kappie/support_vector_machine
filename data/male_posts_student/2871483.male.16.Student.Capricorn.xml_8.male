I don't want to be negative, but I think this won't go on for long, as it needs to be a highly collaborative project, and with one or two people slacking off, it'll be more reliant on the few people who do actively post. The crevice will get further larger, until we all forget about this.    But the future is bright and all etc. etc.    I was going to end my first post with my highly offensive and politically incorrect assessment of all races of the world, but I was forbidden. Impedement of my free speech.    Since when was thisthing aFASCIST STATE? HM?
