Many changes occurred, and looking back on it. I dont think i've had such a busy, eventful few months in my life.  This week alone was crazy. During this week alone i did crappy on 2 finals, stayed up for 24 hours straight, got a girlfriend, got dumped, got a job, got drunk..what a week. Though this semester was fun filled, i'm glad its over. Its time to go on vacation and do nothing too productive for a month while I recover from this semester.   I need a break from people. Here at school, i'm around people almost constantly. I need time to step back from everything and everyone to just think...time to myself.  Life is ever changing, i just havent had the chance to catch up with it yet. One of the largest changes came a week ago when I left ZBT.  I have been wanting to leave now for over a month. It was a decision i had made awhile ago.  Basically I did it because I didnt see eye  to eye with what it represented.  Though i was in a position to change, I didnt think it was fair to force the change on a bunch of guys who liked it the way it was, so i stepped out.  A few other guys decided to leave too, but they did it on their own accord and for their own reasons.  Unlike what most people think, it wasnt some evil plot to sweep the feet out of the organization.  I left because i needed to. There was never a point where the group of us sat down and said "lets kill ZBT". The most that happened was me telling Kevin the prez to get rid of me because i couldnt do it anymore.  I guess its like putting a city boy on a farm and saying, "have a ball." It just wasnt going to happen. ZBT and I were two different worlds So we broke up. LOL sounds like a relationship and in many ways commitments were broken like one. But its over now.  Here I am, a few hours before I leave campus to return to my house, where I will sneeze and cough wayy too often due to my allergies to the damn dog. That little thing is sooo retarted.  I start my new job on saturday, which is great. I need money..as does EVERYONE else. Should be a fun experience.   I really dont have much thoughts right now going throug my head to spew out to all of you. So heres one that just popped into my head: --Every decision, even the smallest ones, alter your future. No matter what decision you make its affecting either your life or someone else's life in the future, so be careful of what you say and do. Though you never know the results of any of the choices they make until they happen, you should take care to make sure you are making the right choice. Life is unpredictable, uncaring, and unloving. We shouldn't expect it to treat us well. Life is what it is, it owes us nothing.  The only thing we owe to it is living.
