How would you like one more? 3.Would you like to come to a party in my toolshed? 4.(my favorite) How about you and I go back to my place and get out of these wet clothes? 5.Is your last name Gillette, it must be because you are the best a man can get.  6.I need a little help with my Calculus, can you integrate my natural log?  7.Pick a number between 1 and 10. Shit you lose now take off your clothes.  8.Do you rent or own? Those wings, you angel! 9.(Look down at the crotch) It's not just going to suck itself.  10.Come on. We're leaving.  11.Does God know you've escaped from Heaven? 12.Is there an airport nearby or is that just my heart taking off? 13.Is that a keg in your pants?
