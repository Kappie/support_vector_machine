Besides my PAWS teacher saying to come see her tommrow morning for something I have no clue what, my history teacher get mad at me for answering too many questions, and a kid dropping my iPod in math. You so just want this day to be over. Then tonight I had to study for my history test which should be a cake walk, and my Geometry test which should be ok. I also had to finish my German project because my partner never got online like he said he would. WinMX is ok. DOwnloaded it last night but its just a thing to hold me over until someone gets another P2P system up. Got some songs off there to put on my scratched iPod >:(. Well tommrow is another day. I just wish I know what my PAWS teacher wants. Really not that happy about being left in the dark about anything. Well bye bye.
