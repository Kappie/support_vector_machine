" why did you make me this way?  how does this benefit anyone?  why do i feel this way, Lord? "  and i know its a stupid question.  i am the way i am because it is a test.  its a reminder.  Paul in the Bible often refers to a "thorn in the flesh".  no one really knows what this "thorn" was.  the most likely theory was that Paul had poor vision.  but Paul asked God 3 times to remove this "thorn".  God declined... he told Paul that this "thorn" was there to remind him that he was human.  that he must have faith in God.  in our weaknesses God is made strong.  my weakness... my anxiety.  all the worrying... all the stress... this is my "thorn in the flesh."  it took me 2 years to realize that.  ha... talk about slow.  but now i know that where i am weak God will be there to make me strong.  in Him i feel strength.  honestly... thats what keeps me alive each day.  God's love.. and His strength.  the love of God... the most awe-inspiring thing ever to exist.  my eyes water just thinkin about it.  goodnight kids.
