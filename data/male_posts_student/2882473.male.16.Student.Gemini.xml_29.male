And I did the first one of two business studies practice exams I had to do. Fairly hard, mainly because it has loads of questions requiring long answers such as 'Describe the business objectives that Peter might have for his family's firm' (8 marks). That test took ages, probably much more than the 90 minutes it was supposed to take. Stupid subject... Oh well, not long until I never have to do another busiess, geography, english or german test ever again. Only about 10 weeks and the exams will all be over. 10 weeks.... *drool*....Wow. That time went fast. It's been 5 years since I joined the school in year 7, and in 10 weeks it will all be over. 10 weeks... That's worryingly not much. I REALLY need to sort out some decent revision process.  Not much else to say.... can I think of anything...? If I don't keep writing this, I haven't really got much else to do on the computer, and if I haven't got anything to do on the computer I get very bored. And I'm not doing any more revision as that business test exhausted me mentally. Oooh, I could read Catch-22... yes, I think I'll do that. Ta ta all.   Playing:  Had a game of solitaire on the computer earlier today...  Listening To:  'The Hedgehog Can Never Be Buggered At All'  Watching:  'Hawking' last night was very good  Annoyed With:  Business Studies (again)  Confused About:  Market Research strategies  Mood:  a bit hungry
