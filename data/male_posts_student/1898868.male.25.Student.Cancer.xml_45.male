I recently purchased a few small house plants, an antique potting bed, and some moss.  I took these and put together a pleasant little ensemble.  I know this sounds really soft, but actually I found it relaxing and enjoyable.  If I won the lotto, I would buy four things after taking care of friends and family.  A restaurant, a golf course, a flower shop, and a gym like Average Joes.   Ok, who am I kidding?  The gym would be way more extreme than Globo-Gym, except without the supplements and plastic surgery.  And also with way more shiny vests (Jack?....Joel?).
