Although i guess there isn't very much good to let in lately. I'm hoping that'll soon change. While on this little walk of mine i wondered what i'm going to do with myself in the future, other topics i wondered about were Prom, Graduation, and my last year to improve my marks so i can get into a university. I really dont know i'm confused about alot of things, mostly of what i've written in here, i just hope that Karma will soon be on my side. I've had alot of Bad Karma lately, and well i just want to have something good to happen to me. I'm getting sick of everything else thats been happening. I've got to much bad and not enough good! and it's beginning to get to me, and unfortunatly i think my "friends" have been noticing it. I've found that i can only be my real self on line because i'm to afraid to show me for what i'm truly for, i guess that's why when i'm online people can actually relate to me, because i'm showing my true self, and letting my emotions loose. Scary thought Eh?...I've taken to writing alot too, although none of my works have been completed there can always be something to add to them. I'm currently working on a fiction/non-fiction story of my friend and I's life and how we became good friends.  I think i'll go to my special place now. I feel the need to get away from this reality....
