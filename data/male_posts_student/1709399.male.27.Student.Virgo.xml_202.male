Well the answer is I will be doing what I used to do before I knew something called V-Day existed. Love is a private emotion  the hype just paints shame on such a wonderful emotion. I remember reading a Ghazal by the Great Sahir on Love  Taj Mahal :   ye chamanazaar ye jamunaa kaa kinaaraa ye mahal ye munaqqash dar-o-diivaar, ye maharaab ye taaq ik shahanashaah ne daulat kaa sahaaraa le kar ham Gariibo.n kii muhabbat kaa u.Daayaa hai mazaak mere mahabuub kahii.n aur milaa kar mujhase!  (Translation : Known throughout the world as a symbol of love and for its beauty, the Taj Mahal, in Sahir's opinion, is an insult to the love and aspirations of the millions of common men and women who live their lives quietly, toiling,sweating, ceaselessly working to scratch a living, and amongst all that, still finding the time and optimism to love. They don't have the wherewithall to proclaim their love by building something as grandiose as the Taj Mahal but that does not mean that there love is any less than that of any emperor.)
