A priest, who works at a parish down the street from A.  He begins to run into A every once in a while, being in the same neighborhood, and A becomes a sort of confidant.  Eventually it comes out that the priest, who is around 30, no longer believes in God.  Furthermore, there is an armed robber plaguing the northside of the city.  There are ads up with rewards for information leading to his arrest.  This robber has been seeing the priest weekly for confession.  As the priest does not even believe in what he is doing, he finds solace in revealing all of this to A.  This then presents A with the option of calling the cops and telling them about the criminal.  He does so, but the robber has a feeling about it (because he sees the priest talking to A one day), and so the robber does not show up to confession when the cops are there.  This makes one more character who is after A (but may eventually be caught and present the money necessary for A to give to C to pay back the debt-collecters...)
