WHAT WHAT?! Tim, you can totally live in CV now LoL hehe...anywayz, we watched like hecka movies..here are the ratings out of 5 stars:  1. Mean Girls: 3 stars (some parts were stupid, but ok overall)  2. The Notebook: 5 stars (awesome movie--im gonna see it again)  3. The Perfect Score: 1 star (guess i just watched it 6 times b/c i had nothing else to do)  4. The Day After Tomorrow: 3 stars (a little boring, but action was sick)    so those were the movies that we watched...all in all i had a fun time. something funny happened--me being in oakland, it being like 4am in the morning, a car alarm goes off. ok, now we all now that CV ppl can't hang in the ghetto, but i had done it before...but i just started flipping out! i thought that some guy was gonna like bust through the window and like shoot me--but lately, i've been having weird thoughts about someone with a gun shooting at me or ppl that i care about. i really need a vaca, huh? but....we hada good time! LoL--good quotes from some of the movies! haha but you have to watch them with ME, b/c im just such a cool-i-osis person (straight ghetto). yeah, but that's a no. nicole, hope you're having lots of fun over there at good ol' Georgetown University, and that you get back safely. Goodbye to Ariel Malliaris who is leaving for camp on sunday! dude, ariel, you'll have lots of fun--but take music, like i said--you won't want to talk to everyone EVERYDAY! LoL! i'll def be up to visit you soon! **No bananas before/after/during work, got it?** and, let Alex give you a few pointers about working in the kitchen. ask her to teach you about Rachel Carlson's technique of making your feet feel better--or just ask her sister, Sarah Carlson, kk? soo have fun, and i'll see everyone later. going to berkely tomorrow i hope--if my mom doesn't flake. well, ttyl byebye     Ashlee Simpson--Pieces of me (excerpt)    I am moody and messy  I get restless and it’s senseless  And you never seem to care  When I’m angry you listen  When you’re happy it’s a mission  And you won’t stop till I’m there
