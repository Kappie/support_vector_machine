First you check some sources to find some random statistic such as rape or murder or something...  Then, while with friends, you casually ask, "Hey, what are the chances that dude wants to rape me?"  Then they take some guesses which are, for the most part, ridiculous.  After a while of humoring them, you need to exclaim "Wrong!  This experiment further proves my hypothesis that you suck at life.  The chance that that man will rape me is 1 in 12...  For example, for those of you that don't understand probability, if I lined up 12 men, the statistics say that 1 of them should want to rape me."  This game is great.  I haven't tried it yet though...  I will soon
