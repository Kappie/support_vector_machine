So anyway today chase and I were moving things around the house to help get unpacked. Moving is not fun...At all, so of course we complain. And today that toilet over flowed and the rug got wet. I was not informed of this. My mom told me to pick up the rug, I said its just wet from the shower. RESULT: EXPLOSION! Chase came up stairs to defend me because mom didn't tell me got dirty water from the toilet. And then a huge argument ensued that resulted in chase leaving and then mom ranting about how much everyone sucks and then she turned on me for a second. I decided to go look for recording equipment online to keep out of my moms hair.            The rest of the day went as follows. We went over to Craig's to watch Resident Evil which was a relatively good movie. After hanging out there I had a bunch of people to bring home so we went to Weeza's to split them up into smaller groups. We left after about a half an hour to bring nick home and then head home our selves. Now before leaving Weeza's we decided that chase would drive because he's 18 and it was past curfew. So of course we get pulled over for careless driving right in front of my house. But, thanks to god I was not driving, or I would have gotten the 94 dollar ticket, and an 88 dollar curfew ticket. We haven't told my mom about it yet we thought that was the last thing she needed today. And that leads me right up to this post. So....dat's it....No more.  Kramer, Out!
