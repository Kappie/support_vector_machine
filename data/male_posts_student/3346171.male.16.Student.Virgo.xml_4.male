There was a championship - sorry the spelling but i'm not in the mood to check this word in the dict- at the beach today morning, it ended about 10 minutes ago, the team with blue t- shirt and red boxes won... GO BOYS!!!!... i think that was soccer, MG! how can they do it? plat soccer for hours under the sun, and in the end they don't even get a coin as cash.. poor people! why don't they stay at home watching " All about comets " ? At least they would get some culture, i ain't saying that soccer is not culture, well.. it's not!!!  Today i got a thoughtfull email... please check out fellows: Necessary and superfluous some want cars, some just want to walk some want a nice watch, some just want to have a wrist some want a promotion at the job, some just want a job some want a better life, some just want a life some want the best house, some just a house some want the superfluous, some just the necessary (Chico Chavier)  Wow, that's so true. Chico Chavier, was so wise. He died couple eyears ago, he was a telephathic.  Tenga paciencia, the internet is down, and i'm writin' all this in wordPad, the lady said that they are improving some things. Did they need to "turn it off" to improve themselves? At times I agree with a friend, she gives support to cuminsm - this girl is crazy-. She can't understand that i like reading books in english, and she hates Mc'Donald's, well, i don't understand why a 2 slashes of bread a thin piece of meat are so expensive. With eight reais - the price of cheeseburger, big cock and big frenchs in Brazil- everybody could buy kilos and kilos of salad, or even buy 4 or 5 kilos of potato and do themselves kilos and kilos of french potato...Did i mention that i ate 800 g of ice cream last week? I'm so embaraced, i ate and ate, that was damn good, and i paid almost nothing - wednesday is the descount day of a ice cream factory here in my naighborhood-.  I've watched " Sex in the city" everyweek, -laughs- that's funny and the theme is showwed with no vulgarity, ok ok ok a little is vulgar a woman tells to her "fuck" that she can't suck him because his cumming tastes like garbage, but they say it so natural that it become a show for the family... actually, i wouldn't let my niece watch that...maybe because , when she's 8 or 9 she'll know more about sex than me, not bropping the subject , the last episode was named " Secret fuck". Carrye just went to her first date with Mr. Big and when she got in there she met an old friend of hers, and this friend didn't introduce his date to Carrye. he didn't because she was too ugly to be introduced to someone - Jeses, what a jerk- and walking in NYC with Mr. Big, they met a couple friends of Big's and he didn't introduce Carrye to them, she started to think that she was like her friend's date, but not too ugly to be introduced to someone, in the end of the episode, she found out that Big didn't introduce her because he couldn't remeber the name of his friends - what a lie-. In the other side of the city Miranda was at the gym, practicing boxe or a wrestle else, then she kicked her teacher, and of course her apology finished on bed, on his bed - GO GIRL!!!- and she found a videocassete, titled "Spake me".. well.. you fellow know where, And she made a joke with the spanking thing - laughs- and he didn't like the joke at all.. poor Miranda. I'm still thinking if i'm ugly enough to not be introduced to somebody's friend.  This week at school, my friend told us a story that really made me laught. She was telling to her mom about a book she read, a really good book, and the leading part of the book is a woman called Regina, and my mom's friend said " Regina, how many centimetres has your vagina?" hahahahahahahahha... i laughed so much that i cried. Her mom is old and really serious. Then we started to talk about parents and sex, and she told us - us= me and lorraynne- that she heard her dad and mom doing it, ew ew ew ew ew a thousand times ew. I and told them - them= lorraynne and carol- that i heard the same... i was in shock.. ew. Who says that teenagers has nothing in head, well, look our talk, it has quality. And who says that an adult can't be a teenager's friend, it's such a big lie. Look me and Joe, we are friends and his is an adult and i'm a teenager, and the same with me and Rose- Rose is a friend from the english course, she is 32, 2 daughters- we rock and when we are together, she always takes me to the bakery - this bakery is heaven, chocolate all around- or to Mc'Donalds to eat banana pies after the english course, she pays all, of course, she has a japanese restarant- sorry the spelling again-.   I'm feeling bad about the Math teacher, but he's a terrible teacher, he says something and then he said that he was wrong, it messes everybody's mind. Last week a girl delivered at everybody's desk a petition, asking us to sigh our names, if we get lost of sighs the head-teacher is going to talk with him.  I feel sorry for him, maybe it's not his fault if we didn't get good grades and all of us are going to have to do the tests again, maybe he was getting divorced and couldn't get focus, maybe his son has a serius deciase and he could pay attenion to himself, or worse, maybe his puddle died and he was hurt inside. I sighed my name, and i don't know if i did the right thing, and somepeople gave me as exemple " bla bla bla the math teacher isn't good, look, till André will have to do the test again, André" as if i was Da Vinci.   Well, voir vous demain école, or even today when i got back from gym.   P.S: i don't speack french at all, i have a little help from the PC's dictionary.
