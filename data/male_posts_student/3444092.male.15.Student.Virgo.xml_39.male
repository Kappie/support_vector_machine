Today was boring, I didnt do much except watch  Edward Scissorhands , (I'll share my thoughts later) and play  KOTOR . I really need to find the funds to get a new game. I'm really looking forward to  Spider Man 2 , I like the fact that game designers are deciding to use actual cities in there games, I know  The Getaway  did it, but its based in London, so who wants to play it? I'm gonna thoroughly enjoy swinging over the Hudson river, and seeing the mob dump a body in the river.  As for eddie scissorhands, I have seen it a few hundred times, and it is by far my favorite Tim Burton movie. I kept getting the thought that it was like a modern day Frankenstein deal, and Ive never thought of it like that. Wynona Ryder is also really hot in this movie. I also like how they did that 50's-esque crap. Yeah its a great movie.
