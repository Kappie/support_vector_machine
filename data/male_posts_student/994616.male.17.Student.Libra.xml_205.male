Tonight:  Me:Oh my god that was STEVE.  Jess: Steve? oh STEVE!   --- Yay STEVE!!!!!! (if you're reading this, call me, let's do brunch) --  Unrelated Sigh. I need to get some new friends, there are less than few people who i would describe my relationship as 'close'.  Hell you could count them on one finger. I think i way too similar to Lance Arthur. He is exactly what i will be in 20 years. He only just got his first relationship. Read about it  urlLink here  Now damnit! He's witty and insightful and what not. It's like me in that it sounds like he doesnt really know how to have a relationship (i'm not just referring to romantic, im talking about any).   Sigh im breaking my rule of no blogging after 11. You can see why the rule exits, i get whiney and incoherant. I can't be that bad if i can still say "incoher- inco- IncoHerAnt" Damn.
