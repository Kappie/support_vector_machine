A:I don't know that one but I do no its not to sit around asking questions, now get out there and make your parents happy.  Q:Why me? A:Why does every one keep asking me that?  Q:Why didn't you answer my question? A:Cause I didn't know the answer and I wanted to avoid it.  Q:Why do we have school? A:So we can all learn something new, go to college and learn something new, then on to work where you will use your learning to help everyone else learn something new and tack Dilbert comics and Dave Barry Quotes to your cubical wall.  Q:Why is the world against me? A:Its not its like a Jedi Knight Academy Free For All Battle, 2 people gang up against the little dude then they turn on each other after the dude is dead.  Q:Why are people cynical? A:Hah, what a stupid question. What do you think I am an overgrown monkey?  Q:...My life sucks what should I do? A:Live with it!  Excuse me if offended any evolutionist...I find the monkey thing funny, now if you excuse me I'm going to get a stick and eat some termites. Ok not really I'm just being stupid and ranting.  Ya like I was wandering around in Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy on a map I downloaded called the Real Jedi Academy. Its so cool its the full map from the Jedi Outcast game except for the fact that there are no but holes in the floors and the walls. Anyway there is the room where they have big blocks that you and Force Push, I was so cool I could make the bot get in back of the rock then crush them...Ya that was satisfying.
