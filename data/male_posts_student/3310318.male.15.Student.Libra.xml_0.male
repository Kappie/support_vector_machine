I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  We all begin with good intent Love was raw and young We believed that we could change ourselves THe past could be undone But we carry on our backs the burden Time always reveals The lonely light of morning The wound that would not heal It's the bitter taste of losing everything That I have held so dear.  I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so...  Heaven bent to take my hand Nowhere left to turn I'm lost to those I thought were friends To everyone I know Oh they turned their heads embarassed Pretend that they don't see But it's one missed step You'll slip before you know it And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed  Though I've tried, I've fallen... I have sunk so low I have messed up Better I should know So don't come round here And tell me I told you so... [2X]  "Possession" by sarah mclachlan  Listen as the wind blows from across the great divide, Voices trapped in yearning, memories trapped in time, The night is my companion and solitude my guide, Would I spend forever here and not be satisfied?  And I would be the one to hold you down, kiss you so hard, I'll take your breath away and after I'd wipe away the tears, Just close your eyes dear  Through this world I've stumbled so many times betrayed, Trying to find an honest word, to find the truth enslaved, Oh you speak to me in riddles and you speak to me in rhyme My body aches to breathe your breath, you words keep me alive,  And I would be the one to hold you down, kiss you so hard, I'll take your breath away and after I'd wipe away the tears, Just close your eyes dear  Into this night I wander, it's morning that I dread, Another day of knowing of the path I fear to tread, Oh into the sea of waking dreams I follow without pride, Nothing stands between us here and I won't be denied  And I would be the one to hold you down, kiss you so hard, I'll take your breath away and after I'd wipe away the tears, Just close your eyes dear  "Building A Mystery" by sarah mclachlan  you come out at night that's when the energy comes and the dark side's light and the vampires roam you strut your rasta wear and your suicide poem and a cross from a faith that died before Jesus came you're building a mystery  you live in a church where you sleep with voodoo dolls and you won't give up the search for the ghosts in the halls you wear sandals in the snow and a smile that won't wash away can you look out the window without your shadow getting in the way oh you're so beautiful with an edge and a charm but so careful when I'm in your arms  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com:: 'cause you're working building a mystery holding on and holding it in yeah you're working building a mystery and choosing so carefully  you woke up screaming aloud a prayer from your secret god you feed off our fears and hold back your tears  give us a tantrum and a know it all grin just when we need one when the evening's thin  oh you're a beautiful a beautiful fucked up man you're setting up your razor wire shrine  ::Chorus::LyricsCafe.com::  {repeat chorus} Taxi Ride by tori amos  Lily is dancing on the table We've all been Pushed Too far I guess on days like this you know who your friends are Just another Dead Fag to you that's all Just another Light missing on a long taxi ride taxi ride  And I'm down to Your last cigarette and this "We are one" crap as you're invading This thing you call Love - she smiles way too much but I'm glad you're on my side, sure I'm glad you're on my side still  You think you deserve a trust fund Just because you Want one Sure you talk the talk when you need to I fear the whole world is starting to Believe you Just another Dead Fag to you that's all Just another Light missing in a long taxi line taxi line  And I"m down to Your last cigarette and this "We are one" crap as you're invading This thing you call Love - she smiles way too much but I'm glad you're on my side, sure I'm glad you're on my side still  Lily is dancing on the table We've all been pushed Too far today Even a glamorous Bitch can be in need this is where you know the Honey from the Killer Bees +I'm glad you're on my side sure I'm glad you're on my side sure I'm glad you're on my side still  Got a long taxi ride Got a long taxi ride  "Don't Tell Me" avril lavigne  You held my hand and walked me home I know While you gave me that kiss it was something like this it made me go ooh ohh You wiped my tears, got rid of all my fears, why did you have to go?

Don't try to tell me what to do, Dont try to tell me what to say, Your better off that way  Better off that way I'm better off alone anyway   "My World" avril lavigne  Please tell me what is taking place Cause I can't seem to find a trace Guess it must have got erased somehow Probably cause I always forget Everytime someone tells me their name It's always gotta be the same  Never wore cover-up Always beat the boys up Grew up in a 5,000 population town Made my money by cutting grass Got fired by a fried chicken ass All in a small town: Napanee  You know I always stay up without sleeping And think to myself where do I belong forever In whose arm the time and place  Can't help it if I space in a daze My eyes tune out the other way I may switch off and go in a day dream In this head my thoughts are deep Sometimes I can't even speak Would someone be and not pretend I'm off again in my world  I never spend less than an hour Washing my hair in the shower It always takes 5 hours to make it straight So I'll braid it in a zillion braids Though it may take all friggen day There's nothing else better to do anyway  When you're all alone in the lands of forever Lay under the milky way On and on it's getting too late out I'm not in love this time, this night  Can't help it if I space in a daze My eyes tune out the other way I may switch off and go in a day dream In this head my thoughts are deep Sometimes I can't even speak Would someone be and not pretend I'm off again in my world  Take some time, mellow out Party it up but don't fall down Dont get caught sneak out of the house  Can't help it if I space in a daze My eyes tune out the other way I may switch off and go in a day dream In this head my thoughts are deep Sometimes I can't even speak Would someone be and not pretend I'm off again in my world  Can't help it if I space in a daze My eyes tune out the other way I may switch off and go in a day dream In this head my thoughts are deep Sometimes I can't even speak Would someone be and not pretend I'm off again in my world  vertical horizon Echo  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...  Everywhere I go There's something I really need Everyone I know Is someone I want to be Even though I don't really know me  I better pick it up Before I let it slip away I better stick it out Before I take another day Into mouth Everything I say fades out  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...  Can I open up your eyes? Only when the clouds break? Can I feel the light? Even though the world shakes Every night, You're my quiet satellite  Can I hold you close? Do her out of focus And everything I know I don't even know this It all falls through I'm here and I hear you  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...  Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Cause I need to, just to reach you Do you hear me? Coming clearly? Am I hollow? Just an echo  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo... Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...  "Shackled"  For so long my life's been sewn up tight inside your hold And it leaves me there without a place to call my own  I know now what shadows can see There's no point in running 'less you run with me It's half the distance through the open door Before you cut me down Again Let me introduce you to the end  And I feel the cold wind blowing beneath my wings It always leads me back to suffering But I will soar until the wind whips me down Leaves me beaten on unholy ground again  So tired now of paying my dues I start out strong but then I always lose It's half the distance before you leave me behind It's such a waste of time  ::Chorus:: 'Cause my shackles You won't be And my rapture You won't believe And deep inside you will bleed for me  So here I slave inside of a broken dream Forever holding on to splitting seams So take your piece and leave me alone to die I don't need you to keep my faith alive  I know now what trouble can be And why it follows me so easily It's half the distance through the open door Before you shut me down Again Let me introduce you to the end  ::Chorus::  Though you know you care  ::Chorus:: And my laughter You won't hear The faster I disappear And time will burn your eyes to tears
