However, Dad asked me to mow the back lawn, as well (which is no small feat, considering our back yard is about an acre of grass). I complied...but only for a short time. The 'ol Murray was having trouble running.  We had had this problem before and we wrongly assumed that replacing the fuel line connector did the trick. So, Dad proposed that we buy some Super gasoline from Speedway and replace it with the gas in the mower already (he thought that the gasoline may have been mixed with water). That didn't work.  So we tried taking off the air filter, as it was considerably dirty. Nope, no effect. It must be the carburetor, right? We sprayed some Carb Cleaner directly into the carburetor...nothing, it was still idling hard and would sputter and stall. Next, I drove over to KMart to get some fuel injector/carburetor cleaner and we put that in the gas tank. Did it work? The damn thing wont even start now. I have no idea what's wrong with Murray. I'm frustrated as hell, though.  Anyway, I did get around to starting my book for AP English next year. I have to read  Man's Search for Meaning  by Viktor Frankl. Ever read it? Good, don't. It is so boring, I was about to fall asleep reading it, and I had just woken up. It's a damn psychology book...and we're reading it for English...go figure. Oh well, it's fairly short (under 200 pages). I'll just have to suck it up and drink some Sobe or something.  News on my car: Dad said he saw a blue 2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser for sale at around $6,500. However, it had 98,000 miles on it. No way, I'm going to keep looking. My friend Chris said that he is going to sell his 1991 Chevrolet Corsica LT and buy his relative's 1997 Pontiac Grand Am GT. Now, I wouldn't mind having a Grand Am...oh well, I'll just have to find something better.  My mind changes so often about what car I'm looking for. As of now, I want a Dodge Avenger, or maybe a Chrysler Sebring (as they are practically the same car). I love the way the Avenger looks, it reminds me of a love child between a Viper and a Stratus. Plus, a 2.5L V6 with 163hp isn't too bad. It's probably the most I can afford (price of car, gas money, insurance), while still having a cool car.  That's it for now. Talk to you all later.
