Liverpool cos they broke my heart when they sold Robbie Fowler to Leeds and his career took a downfall.So when i checked it out at 6,i was well chuffed.We are gonna face Boro on the opening day!Generally,Newcastle fans hate Sunderland(they had a monkey for a manager at one time) and vice-versa but as we all know,those suckers are at the nationwide cos they are well crap!so we only have boro,who we also hate but not as intense as the Black Cats(now you know why they got relegated?).Anyway,i think we are gonna tonk boro real bad cos they still livin in their fairyland of winning the carling cup.big deal!Besides,they are facing the kings of the North East,pride of Tynecastle:newcastle united!i reckon the scoreline will be 3-1 in our favour.bellers will be in the scoresheet and so will al shearer since it is his last season.Hope Woody(my fave)holds the defence tight and drop bramble cos he is a misfit!in the end of the season,we will lift the trophy high up in the sky!a run in the FA Cup is not bad either since we won it six times already.Long live Newcastle!
