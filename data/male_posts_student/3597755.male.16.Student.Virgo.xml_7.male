You just read it? - good  Do you write that way - Please consider if you're life has any meaning. Is the answer anything else than 'no' then you are wrong. period.  1337 5p34k, or in regular symbols 'leet speak' is writing words with numbers in it. Some letters can be swapped. According to the people who use it anyway.(e.g. l - 1) Or syllables can be swapped with numbers (wait - w8). This is about the biggest hint you can give somebody that you're galactically stupid. w8 is not a word. w8 is nothing. Perhaps the name of a highway somehwere but not a word. You must have lost all interest to think if you write that way. Serious, how hard is it to write 'ait' instead of '8'? Will your fingers fall apart if you just type the complete word?   Another sign of complete idiocy is using words like 'rite' instead of 'right'. Even people with a mental handicap write better than that. I will confess, I wrote like that once upon a time as well. I was a child. Ofcourse, I'm still not an adult yet but way more mature than back then. Only if you're in a hurry you have the right to write 'right' wrong, 'rite' for instance.   If you still use 1337 5p34k then you might start moo-ing too because you're a cow. Don't feel guilty, master writing.
