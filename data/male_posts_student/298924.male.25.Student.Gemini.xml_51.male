On a completely different note, it's funny how I equate everything to lines from movies and songs....anyway here is another....I'm taking a note from vintage Ralph Tresvant...."I gotta do what I gotta do".....of course here is not the proper place "real" matters of the heart.....but I suppose it is therapeutic for me to state my intentions here first and then I can't back down from them at a later time....  I've started to read  Violets Are Blue  by James Patterson, a continuation of  Roses Are Red , the latest in the Alex Cross series....this is coinciding with a sort of artistic revival within me lately....I've been writing poetry lately....I have given additional thought to my screenplay with the homie Corey....and I even thought about starting my book....I'm well on my way to Harper Stewart-dom and multi-media mogul status....or maybe I'm regressing to sophomore year me....we'll see soon....  Anyways time to hit the sack....
