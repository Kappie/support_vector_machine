I have two classes with Matt and one with Emily but that's all that I know of.  I'm gonna take my anger out by being a jackass in school and maybe vandalizing something just for the hell of it...hehe i love insurrection.   I went shopping today and got like 3 pairs of pants and 2 shirts.  Now I have something to wear!  Goody!  OOH, this catchy kinda upbeat music with a hint of techno (and a dash of paprika, hh) was on in Goodys (where I was shopping) and I was being stupid and strutting in tune with the music and doing hand motions and head bobbing, half way to embarrass my Mom.  I came to an intersection where the little tile path splits and there was some big advertisement there and I went around it, and this kid was going all out like it was a disco floor with his arms flying and feet moving.  And it wasn't like a little kid...he was a probably 10 or 11 redneck looking kid and he just stopped really abruptly when he saw that I saw him and I just started laughing to myself cuz I was just acting stupid and that kid was doing so much more.  Oh, and I heard "Another Postcard" by Barenaked Ladies while I was there and that's funny because it's a kinda funny song you wouldn't expect to hear there.  I finally finished To Sir With Love and I guess it was ok but it wasn't my kinda thing.  I read cliffnotes (spelling?) for Siddhartha and that seemed much more like a book I would have liked to read all the way through.     I found another artist that whoever's reading this needs to check out: Shinedown.  I've only heard the song "45" but it's really good and it's been stuck in my head.  That's like the first good artist I've heard of on MTV...well it  was  the rock countdown though, so I guess there are more decent artists on that.  That's about all for now...later.
