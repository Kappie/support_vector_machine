The Principal herself made the anouncement. Luckily no one have been stung.   After so many years I finally received a posted mail. These days I usually only received emails. The letter came from Ibrahim, the boy I meet during a Ministry of Education program. Although short it still fun to read. He's very proud of getting number one for his exam and said so in his letter. I don't know why but I decided to reply at once, maybe the charm of written mail. The letter is now already on it's way to Kuala Sleangor. I hope to receive a reply soon!
