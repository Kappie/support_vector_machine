My thoughts are something that I have "invested" a lot of my time and energy over the years. They are the only solace I find in times of distress which I find myself in quiet often. Especially after reading books like Siddhartha, The Alchemist, and The Prophet; I realize the importance of thinking things through and understanding sequences of events which are sometimes called life depending on who you are talking to.   I have come to learn to that we cannot understand everything that happens in our life. That somethings are beyond our comprehension and we must settle with not knowing why this or that happened. As painful as that can be, it is also the beauty of life in that humanity has not solved everything there is to know through mathematical equations and scientific formulas. If that ever happened I imagine life would be awfully boring and sold as text books for every person to decipher.   Although I am pulled to get back to my political work once again, there is a part of me that is resisting with all its might. I suppose it can be described as the battle between responsibility and nostalgia (I am not sure if nostalgia is the correct word, perhaps it is simply heartache.). I am anxious to get back to organizing but I am preoccupied with myself most of the time, reflecting what has happened over the last three years, thinking about her and what life will be like for her in the years ahead. And to be honest I am afraid too, for I do not know what life will be like for me. So many plans and a world centered around her and I is now just left with me which is a lonely feeling.   Then there is the part of accepting the fact that this has happened to countless men and women--broken hearts/ lost loves. It is partly my own fault for feeling the way I do. I am too idealistic and romantic about my life--wanting everything to be tale for the ages. I need to learn that all lifes, including my own are amazing adventures regardless of what happens. But I have conditioned myself to expect the unexpected and the unbelievable, and now I am paying the price for it. I have told this myself many times before but have yet to understand my own words (which shows how far from being wise I am):I have come to value so much again that I had forgotten in my political/ activist days. In the rush to stop two wars--one against Afghanistan and the other Iraq, I forgot all the details of life.... Before I go any further, I think that the following will explain things much better than anything I can write. For whatever I am writing right now is from my heart's memory.   Instead I will post something I chalked for this girl on the campus she goes to. It explains things much better. The point is that for me, my life took this path of love to show me how important everyday events were as well, the trivial things like finding happiness in doing the dishes or cooking dinner, or doing laundry--that is one thing that touched my heart when I met this girl was her joy for life which I have not seen in anyone else. It was something special which I do not know if I will find again... so anyways here is what I chalked.  Once upon a time there was a girl and a boy  They were both lonely  They were both young and looking for someone who could understand them  As fate would have it, this boy and girl would meet on this very campus  At first they were both shy and would meet once in a while to talk about life, family, and their dreams  As time went on the boy and the girl would talk every night   As the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months the boy realized how beautiful and amazing the girl was  She would make him laugh and she would bring out the best in him  The girl found herself realizing the same things  They would meet at cafes and would talk for hours and would look into each other’s eyes with a longing that neither have felt before  The boy would look into the girl’s beautiful eyes and it would speak to him of a world that he wanted to live in   The two would spend hours talking to each other, learning all the details about each other’s wants, desires, and dreams till the crack of dawn  They would share in each other’s fears and hopes…  In their conversations they found a flame that never existed before..  They found love of a type that transcended anything they knew before…  One summer night, also a long time ago…  The boy told the girl he loved her while they were sitting on a park bench.   It was a perfect night..  The reflection of the stars were on the lake and their dreams were painted in the night sky. The wind played music with the girls hair and the stars danced in her eyes.  They boy knew that night this is the person he wanted to live the rest of his life with  The girl said nothing that night to the boy But days later she too, in a letter the boy still holds dear, told him about her love for him  He remembers the first lines of the letter:  “You are the sparkle in my eyes, the shine in my hair, the life in my breath…it is your voice that I hear in the whispers of the wind…”  And they both made vows never to leave other’s side no matter what happened—both knew that long and difficult days were ahead.. both knew many things in the world did not want them together…  But they dared to love one another no matter what the price… even if it would be their own hearts…  The boy and the girl found themselves in a love and in a world that escaped all the horrors of this violent place we call earth  They shared in each others happiness  Borrowing one other’s happiness in times of sadness  Time would go on and the ever growing world watched as the boy and the girl fell deeper in love and vowed to love one another till the end of time…  But sometimes the world is crueler than the saddest pictures of hunger…  The world became jealous of such love… and began a plot to tear their love apart…  Wars were made and a mother’s love was lost  And the boy found himself drawn into the sadness and violence of the world…  He fought to make a small difference, hoping to stop such violence and sadness….  He fought everyday… with both eyes on the world… as it bled in the day and wept at night…as children went hungry… and women lost their children… and fathers their families…  The boy found himself lost in this world trying to help everyone he could running away from his own sadness  In the meantime the girl found herself growing further away from the boy  The boy did not know.. and could never tell at times.. for he was lost himself for a long time… even the callings of his love were not loud enough on the what appeared to be the deaf boy..  He always thought the only world to fight for was the “out there,” never realizing that the world in his heart was just as important  Over the course of months and months the boy and girl tried so very hard to fix things…  But the relentless world would not stop with its plot..  It kept plotting and conniving to keep the two apart  First with the girl’s family who hated and despised the boy for all that he was  And then with the community that did not understand their love  And then the saddest moments happened when the boy’s mother passed away…  Instead of finding solace in their love, the boy ran to fight all his demons against the world…  The boy forgot the most important thing of all… their love… and left it in the hands of the girl…  She did her best to carry the burdens of two loves in her heart.. but she was only a mortal… and time would take its toll…  Eventually she too would falter.. .as the boy did long ago…  No one is strong enough to carry the their own heart and another’s, even if it is their loved ones…  After some time the boy and the girl went their own ways… deciding that neither could endure the heartaches anymore  At first the boy did not understand… even as he listened to the tears of the girl  But as time went on… the boy realized what he had lost…  Not just his love… but his dreams and his hopes… his commitments and his vows.. his happiness and his sadness… he had lost his love….  But the boy could not forget what this girl meant to him… and promised himself not to give up so easily…  The boy learned much about himself while he was alone..  He learned how much he loved this girl and what he would do for her… how he would love her… and much he wanted to love her again.. and crown her his princess again…be her pagla again.. if only she would let him  The boy learned he could not save the world, if he could not save his own heart…  The boy felt inside the girl still loved him but was only scared of what might once again be a broken heart.  Inside the boy knew this time that he would give everything for this girl and be happy… if only the girl could see his heart…  The boy found himself longing for the girl’s love again… for her companionship… and her care.. her smile… her smile and her honesty… her happiness and her sadness… for all her perfections and imperfections built like a queen  The boy knew the girl needed some time on her own and he was willing to wait.. but he wanted to let the girl know that his heart is still hers and that he would wait for the girl to return it to him if she ever wanted to see the boy again…  The boy knows how brave the girl has been in the past… and he asks her to be that brave once again so he can take care of all the hurts he has caused her heart… and so they can forget those hearts and live their dreams together…  The boy used to chalk to stop a war and now the boy chalks to stop the love of his life from leaving forever…   --------------------------------------------------- And since I am a (bad) poet, I am gonna throw in my poems in this blog to, so for anyone that is reading this, they are gonna have to suffer through them.  I have seen and felt many things. I have felt flowers on my fingertips and thorns in my heart. I have seen darkness in man's heart and the dawn of beauty. I have felt the sun on my face and its burning fire in my passions. ...  ---------------------------------------------------  I feel I don't have to carry the weight of my thoughts on my shoulder after I blog...
