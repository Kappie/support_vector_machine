Hiding it is not going to do anything.That's one of the main reason's  why I made this blog.The other one is because I was bored.I don't hide  the truth.I don't use excuses to hide true facts.Don't be a little bitch ass homo and say shit like"I didn't mean to" or "It was an accident."That won't make a diffrence. If you kill someone, It won't make a goddamn diffrence if it was on  accident or pourpose.They will still arrest your ass no matter what.
