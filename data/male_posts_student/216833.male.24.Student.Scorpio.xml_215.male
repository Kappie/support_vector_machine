I spent the last few waking hours of the oh three drink some booze with some new friends and joking about the accident i was a part of the evening of dec 31st. New drivers, I got banged in the ass by this 19 year old guy. Oh wait, I mean a car accident.   2004 should be interesting. Not as much crazyness, but I will find some for sure. This has been a swell group of holidays.  I wish all my friends in Tejas a HAPPY NEW YEAR!! I miss you all, and sorry i didn't get to see all of you. We need to hang at tea house in the big SF reading passages from hip books and seeing all the bueaty and art and wonder there is to life.   I wish all my friends in Cali a HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! You are all hella the sickest! :)  Read a good book and then write it out in steam from your coffee cup.
