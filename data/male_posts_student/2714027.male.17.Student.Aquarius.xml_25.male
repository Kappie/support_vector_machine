I should be revising for a test I've got tomorrow and I could play a game, but I can't be bothered. Don't ask me why, I just don't know. I'm sure everyone has these moments where they've got stuff they could be doing, but instead choose to just waste time not being bothered. Then you think "GET UP AND DO SOMETHING LAZY!" and eventually you'll move from your seat and sit around somewhere else. And eat. Then sleep. You know, that's what a hamster's life must be like. You wake up, you eat a bit, then move around the same old cage, then sleep. That's it.  But then again, would you really want to be a hamster? I mean, you only live a couple of years and you never get to play  Halo  unless you're especially gifted. You probably wouldn't meet any fellow rodents and about 66% of your life would be spend asleep. Better than koalas though, they spend  22  hours a day asleep. Quite an achievement really.  Enough writing for today. I'm going to go and do something other than sit around because I'm not a hamster or a koala and I can.
