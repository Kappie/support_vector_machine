Regrettably, the one thing I wanted the most for my special day did not come to pass - some sort of natural disaster that wiped the California electorate into the sea before October 7th. Nope, the Big Man Upstairs couldn't seem to manage it. And now Arnold Schwarzenegger is the freakin' governor of the FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.  But never mind. I have made my peace with it. As Donna Britt said in her Washington Post column, "The people of California will get what they deserve." How right she is. Hehehehehe... The ignorant have sowed the seeds of their own doom. And that's just fine with me - I, for one, voted for the smut peddler.  Or at least I might have.  Anyway, it doesn't matter terribly much - my commentary is just meaningless jabber at this point. I've stopped trying to find any rhyme or reason to anything that occurs anymore. Existence is just a chain of random events that keep the universe from standing completely still. It is nothing more. Justice does not exist. Just ask the Republican Party. They drew the long end of the stick in this sick, twisted carnival that we call life.  Oh, and go see School of Rock. Its heart warming.
