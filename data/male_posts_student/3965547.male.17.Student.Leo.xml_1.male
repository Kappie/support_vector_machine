In the 11 years they've been in the public-eye as a rock band, they have obtained the title of "Best British Rock Band" in the eyes of the many hordes of fans they have. They've produced 6 main studio albums which they've gone on to release. The first of these was "Pablo Honey" in 1993 and the last full album released was "Hail to the Thief" in 2003. However, their most widely acclaimed album probably has to be the 1997 release "OK Computer".    The underlying thing that can be said about Radiohead is that they are one of few bands to achieve the status of greatness they prevail on. Their music has characterised a generation - much like the music of other rock greats such as Guns 'n' Roses and Metallica, though it wouldnt be fair to put Radiohead against such bands because its a rather different mix of music. Although still rock, Radiohead are a lot more electronic than the hard rock guitar of Guns 'n' Roses.     Radiohead, however much longer they stay around, will always be remembered as one of the Great British Rock Bands. For that Radiohead, I thank you.
