Life there was indeed terrible, imagine there's no high-rise building, the road made of soil and sand, a few shopping mall, no public transportation like MRT or bus, dusty and polluted environment, high crime rate, unhygenic dishes and aweful food.  For now, I shall not go into detail of how's my life in Cambodia. A lot of things have happened there, some bad and some good. It would take a whole lot to dump my thoughts and comments in this post. I would cut it short and sweet.  First of all, I want to apologise to you guys that I didn't buy any souveniers or gifts over there because there's really nothing special that takes my glance. And it's a bit costly.  Quite disappointed that when I am back, my MSN friends didn't take the initiative to chat up with me first or they didn't even notice I was in overseas? Nevermind. In case you might be wondering why it takes so long for me to update my blog, it's because I am too busy to blog those few days. My time is fully occupied by many activities that I got to do, like PC maintainance, Internet stuff, etc...
