I've been looking forward to another Neal Stephenson book for a long time, especially after the masterpiece 'Cryptonomicon' several years ago.  'Cryptonomicon' is one of those books I would hand to anyone I know at the drop of a hat.  Hysterical, gripping, fascinating, and just a damn good story.  Hopefully, Quicksilver will be a worthy follow up.
