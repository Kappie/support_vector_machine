I was kinda mad about that, but I can't stay mad at her. She's my boo. She made up for it. She called me around 12 this afternoon and talked to me for a while. I talked to Josh pretty much all day, as always. He's my baby. I love him so much. OMG.. The Simple Life 2 premiered tonight. It was so funny. Paris Hilton and Nichole Riche are the funniest people ever. They are so dumb. I went to my friends house and watched it tonight. We had a craving for Chinese food, so we went and ate at Janbo's before it started. Overall, I had a nice night. I got home around 9:15 or so tonight. I called and talked to Josh for a while. I have to wait till Monday to take my driver's test. It sucks so bad. Well, I'm gonna stop writing now so I can go and talk to mah man. I'' catch you guys on the flip side. Later.
