Nothin' serious, may haveta just pull it out, which I hear is inhumanly painful.  In any case, we're goin' to that whole skating thing tomorrow, and you know what that means! It means everyone gets to see just how ragingly incompetent I can be. No big deal, I'm gonna try to get used to it as much as I can, and maybe I'll get down some basics. Comforting to know I'll have some company, tho, seems the General is about as incompetent as I am, but he's probably better, anyhow.  Let's see how much fun the rest of you can have, tho.     Black Sabbath - Sweet Leaf (First two verses)  When I first met you, didn't realize I can't forget you, for your suprise you introduced me, to my mind And left me wanting, you and your kind Oh yeah!  I love you, Oh you know it  My life was empty forever on a down Until you took me, showed me around My life is free now, my life is clear  I love you sweet leaf Oh yeah!    I'm Deadinside, 'till later  "The mark of the beast seems clear now, but I just can't tell"
