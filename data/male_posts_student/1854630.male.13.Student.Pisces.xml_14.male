The thing is, most of their material IS from other magazines. I'm not exactly sure how that all works out, but I enjoy reading it because its the best of the bunch each time, the best from each magazine.  Or something like that.  They had a large section about street art, such as graffiti and stenciling. They had a guide on how to make a stencil, and I made the ninja-type thing in the picture above.  There were quite a few stencil/graffiti pictures, including one I loved and was able to find a picture of on the internet.     In other news, we had a yearbook meeting for next years yearbook committee after school today. I tried out a few months ago and made it, which may or may not be due to the fast that I know most everyone on the yearbook staff. The meeting was mostly about advertisements and the theme of next years yearbook. No one was saying much, so I was contributing as much as I could, even though it was generally garbage. I did have one idea though that I thought was pretty good. We could have the yearbook be a computer. You know, each page could be a window, and there could be other computer related stuffs. Yet the idea was shot down. Oh well. Anyway, I think the yearbook advisor hates me already, and the next school year hasn't even started yet.  I'm going to start taking a lot of pictures. Not just for yearbook, but for me. There's an art of taking photographs called  urlLink lomography , and from what I understand of it, its taking pictures everywhere you go, not even always looking through the lens. Making photography a part of your life. Not stopping to make sure you have the perfect shot, just firing away at the landscape, at whatever object you want to memorialize in a photograph. About a month ago, I went to their website and read about it. Ever since, I've been looking at things and thinking "Wow, I wish I had a camera with me." My dad is bringing home the digital camera from his office tomorrow, and so shall the reign of lomography begin.  (Yeah, I know that technically lomographers are supposed to use a special kind of camera, but I don't think that's really the most important aspect of lomography anyway. Lomography. That's a weird word to type out.)
