Although I found it amusing when my mom walked outside (where I was reading) and saw me having my head half off the table and half on it asking if I was awake. It kind of scared me, but I was awake. It was the best way I could think of to read. I am going to try and get out of the habit of editing my posts and just add new posts for each time I post (ack, I tried to think of another word for post...now I know, entry, oh well). I think that today was a 7 on Colin's scale of 1-10. Although the reading brought up the score, I really didn't have anything else to do. I need to find some way to show you how I am feeling for each post short of just writing it. Like some kind of emoticon that will stay there. I want to get Livejournal, but I only know one person who has it and he already gave out his code. I could pay $4 a year, but I'd rather not. If worse comes to worse and I start really liking this I might buy the ad-free version of blogger, at the very least.   Dominique comes back tomorrow! I have been so bored this week and I finally get to talk to her. Eh, nothing much more to say on that subject. New paragraph.  Well, I have just about nothing else to say. Hmm...there is a strange red mark on the back of my middle finger's knuckle and I don't know how it got there. I usually am subject to writing long accounts of my day, but this is about all I did today. I went to Safeway, got some food there (good food). Things will start getting considerably more interesting in this journal when my next door neighbors come back. Who knows what I will do when they are home. Well everyone, goodnight. When you can't sleep at night, ask yourself this: Why are there millions of laws to enforce the 10 commandments?
