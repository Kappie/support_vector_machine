My little brother was mostly the one that celebrated the 4th of July, because I was inside enjoying spider-man 2...*hush* *hush*.  Then Monday I finally started going to school again but I got there late.   And Tuesday which was the most important days of the whole summer, I overslept and missed the final test!    So today, even though I knew I had no chance of taking it again, I went to school and found out I have to wait until November.  So that was it, and my mom had left already. So I first went to the restroom then walked around and ended up outside in the front of the school. It was around 8:00 and the morning was very hot and humid and there was very little shade. But I waited until 9:00 and finally gave up and called my mom to pick me up. Cause I was not about to wait until the usual time she picked me up i.e. 10:00.  Anyways a very  funky  feeling started coming up around my stomach...yes it was the diarrhea. So now it wasn't just waiting in the hot sun, but a race to go to the toilet. [i think it was the orange i drank in the morning]  Okay that was alot of info, maybe even too much. But that was my morning. In the afternoon I started watching the 10 episodes of DBZ I downloaded off a torrent eps. 11-20. Then after I finished I started downloading 21-30 which I'm still downloading right now. Which technically is already Thursday, well until next update. I think I'll check for that episode 90 of Naruto now.
