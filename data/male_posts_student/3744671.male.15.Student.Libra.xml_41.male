It's a book about two guys (who's names escape me for the moment) made Doom, which turned out to be a mega success for them. It's a great book with lots of backstory and everything. Definitely an interesting book! Highly recommended! The only problem is I've went to book stores like Chapters and Coles to look for Masters of Doom and had no luck, but I was able to buy it online from Amazon luckily.  If you're interested you can buy the book  urlLink here if you're American   or   urlLink here if you're Canadian   Not a bad price either considering it's a hard cover book, plus books in general like this are usually more elsewhere.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
