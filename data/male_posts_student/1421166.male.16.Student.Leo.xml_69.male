In my face. I was kinda sad. Sigh...I almost cried. I think it was then that I really felt that I needed God, thatvI felt really sinful. I really hope to change. Especially after yesterday's message on 'In the world, but not of the world'. The passage is John 17. My life mission is to be salt and light for God, and to extend His kingdom. I think I really have to keep that in mind even as I go about my daily life.
