Last night, I became rather fed up with my words being misinterpreted, mistaken for insults, and made fun of, so I though that I'd stop talking. I knew that something this rational wouldn't last very long, so I planned it for only a day.        Well, that didn't work either. Two hours into it, I realized two things:        a) I was feeling much better than I did last night, and    b) it was getting increasingly difficult to imagine not talking to my friends for a day.        Oh, and my away message sounded extremely childish.        Now, certainly, I have managed to go for nine days without talking to friends online, but when it's pure choice, and the computer desk also occupies the rest of your day as your drawing space,  you  try ignoring the world*.        So, around ten o' clock, I gave in, and joined the world of the online once more.        I'm going to see Dodgeball tomorrow with Aubrey. It's not the top choice for a movie to see together, but hey, it works. I've been thinking through all the possibilities of what might happen... I might get popcorn in my face... I might choose the one seat that has no cushion... it's endless. And highly amusing.
