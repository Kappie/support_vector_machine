Imagine this: someone makes a movie like that about Kerry...He gets his ass sued off and then all the Democrats mob him and then being typical americans we blame Bush and impeach him.   The other side: Someone makes a movie about Bush...He makes millions and people praise him and being typical americans we get pissed at Bush and impeach him....  Oh boy this is a win-win senario...I swear how the hell does this work. I suppose you all are patriotic enough to even get pissed at Reagan even though he's dead and he was republican. I can't beleive all of you, you have no sense of pride in your country. Damn democrats...You hate Bush so much you don't have time to hate Kerry or think about what your doing and where you live. Heh now Garrett is going to post some heated comment under this and ya, and all of you are going to riot and kill me and I'm going to have a field day fixing the blog. So for the remainder of the time none of you are admins cept for Steve cause he couldn't mess it up if he treid and I trust him.((Yes all of you were admins and no offense Steve but you couldn't and you know it))
