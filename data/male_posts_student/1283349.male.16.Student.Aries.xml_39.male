Bug collecting is in full season at Jesuit. 50 freakin' bugs...way too many to ever be in one place at one time in one reality, if you ask me. I think there should be three bugs TOTAL. Despite this looming grade, I still manage Imperian up the wazoo. The lil bugger Rasca's really taken a grip on me. He's sooo fun to roleplay...to be honest, in Joe's campaign I could do with a lot more roleplaying scenes and activities, and a lot less combat. I -would- RP all the frickin' time, and I keep on trying to nudge him into my direction of playing, but I haven't had any luck so far. And to make it worse, I hardly get the chance now! We enter into combat before anything significant can ever happen! Aieee! Woe is me.  And if I -were- to have this much combat and not go insane with my lack of rocking-ness, I would have to play as a combat-centric character. But here's the catch 22: I'm beginning to really really hate making new characters only to have Joe declair them overly godlike and kill them in some really gruesome/annoying/dumb way. This is supposed to be a heroic game, damnit, not Aunt Jemima's Country Style Real Homemade Marmelade. Fuck.  -Dice Squirrel Admirer of Aunt Jemima
