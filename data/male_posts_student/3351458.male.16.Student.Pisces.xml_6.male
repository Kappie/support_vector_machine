Looks like the five of us are going to see the library a lot again next week. That library will always be remembered as a second home to me. We practically live in it. We know how to check library books out using the comp system, we know all the passwords to everything, we get access to the librarian's exco room.... We get to do all the stuff even some librarians can only wish of doing... (snicker!) Back 2 the debate. I managed to make a fool out of myself, which is nothing new really. Got mad on stage, swore in Chinese, Hokkien, English and Malay for a full 20 seconds after I finished my speech and then set my mind to muddle their third speaker up, which I didn't successfully do either... But anyway, who cares? We won! Who cares if we had to spend the next three hours doing nothing waiting for the results? Who cares if some dumbass teacher was so intent on telling a whole crowd that I was stupid for arguing the way I did in my speech? (Course, I wish that teacher the worst of luck in his Salehhudin debate competition. May his team lose in the first round so I can snicker some more!) It is a pity that Euro 2004 is going on now, coz I can't seem to stay awake long enough to watch matches anymore. How I wish to be able to stay up until the ungodly hours of 4am again! I've read that wives have divorced from husbands because they felt ignored thanks to football. Hmm..........let's just hope my future wife is more patient than that...  Well, here's to me debate teammates and to Yoke Teng, who has been kind enuff to do a  LOT  of things for me even though I don't really know him that well...
