Rather amazed they actually came out wif this game lol. Our starting pt was pasir ris and end at east coast park. We get to play some gamees or rather a challenge at every station we go lol. Though our grp lost in the end, I'm rather happy coz I get to noe more pple in my grp lol. Though we have different interest, (as in they were like shopping about toking bout movies and ps games lol) at least I noe them better lol. Haha. Then went to east coast park then somehow slack thr coz all the activities are not carried out as planned lor, due to last minute changes. So the committee actually gave them free time till the bbq in school lor.   Had a tok wif the yr 2 BOD today. It's like everyone's voicing their opinions lor. And i truely think that we the bod need to be more bonded lor, and like what zhen yi said lah I should realli be more outspoken lor. I assure it's a challenge I'll accept and try my best to overcome man... Rest assured I will...   Had a tok with wei jie and pei ching at the beach today lor. It's when we realli voice our opinions out lor. Wei jie actually said that the B.O.D announced is not realli confirmed and some changes might be made. When I knew tat I was like oh my... better not let tis happen man coz it's like bringing u to the top of the ladder and making u fall lor. I admit I can't realli bond the grp lah, but isit realli my fault lol. Haiz. Like what zhen hui said lor it's like tat initially lol. Hopefully ba... haha. Yah lah wat wei jie said might be rite lah. He and Vivian actually contribute so much to eclub but in the end didn't get a post, so haiz... No wonder they not realli happy lor...  Things turned out better during the bbq. Though I'm not in the camp committee, I actually helped out lor to start the fire, serve food save food 4 teacher etc. I realli wonder whether my hard work is like recognised lor. It's like all other camp committee except a few were like enjoying themselves playing ball games and oso other games in their own grps lor, so it was like no one is acually thr to help with the bbq stuff lor, except 4 a grp of gals lor. Haiz... What to do lor. So damn tired today lor, walking around serving food and drinks to various grps, help clear up the stuff and pack the leftovers into boxes 4 pple to bring home. Kept asking around but no one wants lor, so I brought it home and it's like curry lor. When I reach home the box containing the curry actually leaked lol. Sian....  Did so much 4 the club, but is it realli recognised? Juz hope that tis will give them a better impression of mi ba... A way of bonding... I nv expect anything in return lor, juz hope tat they'll accept mi lol   Anyway i'm used to doing such things liao, coz sec school oso like tat lor.  So happy that i actually managed to noe more faces and chat wif them after the camp man.  No matter what happen, no matter how hard the road ahead might be, I'll never give up man... (strive high~)  3 cheers and 3 cheers 4 the eclub camp man... Though it's not realli as successful as expected, all the hard work and effort u guys had put in can be seen and recognised....
