That's all to it.  However, this seems to be a different case with this blog. All I ever seem to talk about is music, music and more music. I anticipate some protests about me continuously talking about music, so I'll promise to lay off it for a while, ok?  By the way, if anyone has anything to say to me but is too lazy tocomment or think it is not related to my topics, just put it on the tagboard. Thank you.
