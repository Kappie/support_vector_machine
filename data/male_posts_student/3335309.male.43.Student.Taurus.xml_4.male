The underpinnings of the theory of Qi goes something like this:  in the beginning, there was Qi (invisible) energy.  As time passes, Qi energy begins to organize itself in 12 distinct alignments (chronologically, in order):  Lung, Large Intestine, Stomach, Spleen, Heart, Small Intestine, Urinary/Bladder, Kidney, Pericardium (muscle around the heart), San Jiao, Gall Bladder, Liver.  In time, the invisible Qi develops further into the physical realm, creating the vital organs to facilitate it's own processes. Yet the energy of the particular organs extends throughout the body on specific meridians.  Some energy systems connect from the hand to the heart, other connect from the feet to the head.  I suspect that one could spend a lifetime perfecting these relationships.  But I am only 6 weeks into this and my eyes are wide open.  *SP6 refers to a specific point on the spleen meridian that helps to activate energy blocks that might exist in the genitals.  Since most of us are always looking for ways to enhance our sexual experience, this is a must know for everyone.
