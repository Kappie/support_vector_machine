I went online to meow at my friends.  Hmmm. At 11.30, we met to go to Orchard. HaHa. They want to walk around. Joyce, PY and KS were at PJ consulting teacher cats, so me, WQ, CQ and HM went ahead to Orchard first. So meowful. We went into Popular to wait for them to come. How meow meow.   They came after some time (I don't know how much time elapsed. I am too busy reading Sabrina. Heh). Some cats wanted to go eat Sakae Sushi in Orchard, but majority of us want to eat that in Causeway Point. Dinner hour is at 3, so we got lotsa time to spend in Orchard. We went to HMV at the Heeren to look at some CDS. I listened to Beyonce's Dangerously In Love, and I absolutely fell in love with it! I want her CD, along with Dido's and Evanescence's. Meow!! They went to the arcade to play some meowing games, then we went back to Causeway Point.  Hmmm. Sakae was meowing. So much Jap food. I hate the Miso Soup, but I like the egg-thingy. So sumptous! Hmm. I ate until quite full le. Hoyce's brother, James, joined ua halfway. Meow moo. It was a real tight squeeze. Squeezy squeze. Even the watermelons and the sushi meowed at the ducks.   After that, we walked down. We met that KH halfway. I then rushed off to meet Wendy, just muttering a hasty "bye". Actually, I didn't go to talk with Wendy just to avoid him. I originally made plans with her already ma. I went there to talk, sometimes with Ayu. Meow moo meow! We chatted till 7+, when I have to go back home to watch TV.   Hmmm. I came back home, bathed, watched TV and came online. I registered my JAE le. I put PJ Sci, YJ Sci, YJ Arts and PJ Arts, in that order. Yeah. Only these 4. With my 12 points, I am sure to get into PJ de lor. If not PJ, then YJ. Meow moo! Even ducks will agree.   HaHa. My mother just helped catch a thief at Shop N Save. She saw him taking a plastic bag off Counter 4 (empty tonight) and going towards the bird nest section. She alerted Pek Chu, who alerted Vincent. They saw him taking 2 boxes of bird nest, then jia jia look at the batteries, then went out. Woah. PC and Vincent chased after him. HaHa. They managed to catch him (and lotsa cats were watching). They let him go in the end (bird nest taken back of course). Hmm. Mother reckons that PC is gonna get scolding for letting that guy go. Hmm.   Oh well. I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
