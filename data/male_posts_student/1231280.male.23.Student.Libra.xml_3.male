Zeke was completely wasted at the time and doesn't remember a thing. He then proceded to ram my car into a cement wall and fuck up the radiator and well as some other shit.Zeke then left my car somewhere and walked back to his fraternity. I called the police and filed criminal charges against him. Got the car towed today, and I'm gonna be without a car for 10 to 14 days. (Thanks alot, asshole). This just goes to show that absolutley all of us drink way too fucking much and only about 15% of us can actually control ourselves when we drink. If you think I'm wrong about this, you're fooling yourself, your family, your friends, and need medical help. Other than than all of this shit that I have to put up with now, I just sat around today, drank beer and watched college b-ball. Tomorrow I work and then come home to snow and no car. What a bunch of fucking crap!
