Then amplitude came out (Sequel game to Frequency) and I got more interested in all the artist in the game but garbage had something more appealing (I don’t remember exactly) anyway I went to their site and got quickly hooked. Then I was in Sam Goody and their was Beautifulgarbage and I thought what the hell. And bought it and loved it. Later I got more into old garbage songs and I liked them even better. (The old songs are great!). Garbage is making a new album working title “Hands On A Hard Body” I’m defiantly buying that when it hits stores.
