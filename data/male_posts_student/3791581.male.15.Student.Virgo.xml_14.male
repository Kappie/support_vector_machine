It had been a very long time since all of us were under the same roof, let alone the same time zone.  Somewhere around that kitchen table, we found a natural curiosity for each other and realized that we had lost so much with the passing of time and that we hardly knew one another.    It is here where we can share our feelings and thoughts with one another. You'd be amazed to see how much you can learn about a person when you open up their journal.  Hope you will enjoy this as much as I do!  Much love!  On a more personal note, my family and I are soon about to make some changes in our lives.  We're moving...again!  Wish you all could be closer to help us slug boxes.  And I'm not kidding about that!  I'd put you all to work.  Hee!  I'm sad that we have to leave our friends and NY family, but eagerly anticipating the new adventures that lie ahead.  Please keep us in your prayers.
