Heh, a lot of people hated me. Well, they mostly still do. I guess it's because of the whole "WOW ADAMS A HOMO OH NOES!!!1111111111111!!!omgomg!!!!1".   Heh, from a comment: "[We don't like Adam] Cause he's a fuckin smartass, and he's gay". Lovely, no? I'm shocked at the feverity (sp?) of what happened there. People were going at it like rabid... Err... Boys :P  Geez. And they're still not over themselves!
