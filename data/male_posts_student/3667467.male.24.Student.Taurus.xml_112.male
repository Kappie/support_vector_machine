That's what's so wonderful and magical about being a substitute teacher: you never know if you're working that day, UNTIL that day. Today at 7 AM I got a call to work, but that was too late; I can't get in on time unless they call between 5:30 and 6:30 in the morning. (Gee, I recall the nights when I used to go to bed at that time. They were two months ago.) So that call failed. An hour later, another call, this one asking me to teach, I mean "teach," middle school gym. Seeing how I majored in History in college, and played basketball twice in those four years, well, I didn't take that one either. And then, an hour after that: "Are you available to teach elementary school?" Oh heck. Colors, clocks and the numbers from 1 to 20? I can barely do that now! Darned if I can walk down the halls in a straight line. In conclusion, today is my day off, and I haven't slept well.
