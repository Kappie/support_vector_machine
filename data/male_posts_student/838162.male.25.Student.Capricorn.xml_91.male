Decided that a good first step would be to try to make the place compliant with the HTML 4.01 Transitional standard and eventually work towards XHTML transitional compliance. So that means removing some tags and replacing some with another tag that basically does the same thing. It’s a good thing because I intent to keep this site around for sometime and even when I do move to my own web host, it’s going to use some lines of code from here as a reference so it’s good to start planning for the future. Besides, I need a reason to practice what I learnt during my website creation module earlier this year, although all I really learnt was focused on XHTML and just a little bit on scripts using  .jsp  and  .asp .  Speaking of website scripts, I’ve added some links to more blogs as well as removed some dead ones. One of the new blogs, is from  urlLink Beverly , who is one of the few females I have come across who is a wiz at the  Perl  scripting language. I know I’m generalizing but there doesn’t seem to be many females who are good or even like to code. I know I have met some in  urlLink Second Life , and I’m sure there are a fair even share of female graduates from computer based degrees that can code well, but to actually like it? Now that’s rare I think. And brings me to the question:  Why can’t I meet more girls like that??!! .  It’s saddens me to think that while I do know  C  and  C++ , I can’t say that I’m good at them and my frustration at the whole programming process is sapping any joy that I used to derive from writing code. That being said, I should learn  Perl  as well as  .Net . Maybe I should ask  urlLink Beverly  the best way to get started on them.  Another blog, I’ve added is from a fellow “ practitioner ” of the fabled art of    urlLink Palm  Fu  ,  urlLink Gordon . I actually know more “ practitioners ” in the  urlLink group  I used to run around that  urlLink Gordon  is also a part of but I seem to have lost touch with them. Oh well.  urlLink Gordon  is a fun and loud character to trade “fixes” with but he does have his soft side as seen in his blog.  And lastly,  urlLink Tamara . I have lost touch with her many many years ago and it’s a testament to the usefulness of things like  urlLink Friendster.com  to reconnect with long lost friends. In this case its especially meaningful cause  urlLink Tamara  did play a signification role in a point of my life. I guess I can call her a   Childhood Sweetheart  . She’ll probably smile at that. But now she has far better things to smile about for she is recently engaged! My most heartfelt congratulations to her and to her husband-to-be.
