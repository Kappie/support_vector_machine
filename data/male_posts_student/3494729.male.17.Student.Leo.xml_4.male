Then you call all your friends as if theres gonna be some awesome sunday afternoon party going on somewhere. Then you just sit there with your keys in your hand watching TV for hours so it looks like your just waiting to be called back before you leave for somewhere important, even though no one's going to call you. Eventually you just go someplace pointless by yourself for no other reason than to get out of the house.   Yea.... me neither...  -alex
