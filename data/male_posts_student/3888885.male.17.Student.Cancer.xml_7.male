Feeling of fondness, it never denied,  yet it cant wholeheartedly decide,  did it really want to bloom for me?  or did it bloom cos i made it be?   in the end, return it i did,  to the wild to which it belonged,  and i wept, and wept, and cried, and cried,  for the love i lost, for which i mourn.   and i'm leftalone again,  walkingwhere the withered petals lain,  and to this day, i'm left in pain,  regretfuli maynever love again..
