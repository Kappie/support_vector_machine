It has come to my attention that I may wish to attend your university, so I thought that it may be polite to offer my services and presence for next year. In exchange for my attending your university for my undergraduate and postgraduate studies, I offer my acceptance of any form of scholarship that you are willing to bestow upon myself.  My services to the university will include postgraduate research in the areas of philosophy and mathematics, the promise of work of a very high standard and a future commitment to ANU. In the fields of logic, number theory (including the Riemann Hypothesis) and epistemology, I am willing to attribute all findings to the universities own research teams.  Please do read my offer with utter openness of mind and depth of thought, as my services will not be available for too long a period.  Yours sincerely,  Christopher R. McMaster
