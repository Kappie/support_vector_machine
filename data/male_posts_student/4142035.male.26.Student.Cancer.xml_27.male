They're tested on things like what "FF" means on a VCR, what day the abbreviated "Thurs" corresponds to on a calendar. Shit like that. And the higher the language level, the harder the test. There are 10 levels of intro ESL classes before you can take English 101. For the higher level students, they gotta know what it means when their medication bottles say "Take one pill by mouth, twice daily" and even tougher things like reading an analogue clock. Twice a quarter, they have to take these TWO HOUR tests, once in the beginning and once toward the end of the course. And they have no effect on their grade or placement into future classes. However, if students, overall, are not passing the tests adequately, the state can sanction the school. The lady who I am volunteering under doesn't even teach the material.  "Welcome to education," she says.  I have very little patience for that kind of crap. More tolerance will come with experience, I assume. But damn. What a jerk-off session tonight's class was. Most of them couldn't even figure out where to put their name because they use fuckin' scantrons for the damn tests.  If the state really wanted students to learn how to use a VCR or how to read a the directions on a prescription med bottle, they should make a multi-lingual book and give it to them at the beginning of the quarter. There. Problem solved. In the four hours per quarter that students have to take these ridiculous, asinine, pointless exams, they could be taught enough English to do all the things that the test wants them to do. Or, they could (gasp!)  figure it out for themselves.  Or even (no!) ask somebody they know! But no, that would be WAY too rational an approach for the educational administrators in the this state. And, as George Carlin said in his lecture about the impossibility by eliminating sex crimes by simply outlawing religion,"We don't have time for rational solutions."
