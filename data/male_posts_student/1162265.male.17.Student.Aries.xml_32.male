I'm so happy about that, that I can look into the future and smile just as much as I'm smiling now.  Now if only my NHL would arrive everything would be perfect.    Clay told me today, they didn't accept me into FNL because they would have had two short skinny black guys, to much confusion.  I don't know how I'm supposed to take that.  I think, I'll just read "African World Revolution" that'll clear my mind for awhile.  I wonder why it's not spelled all Assata Shakur like (Afrika), oh well.  I don't really care.
