Decided to bounce on over to the Vesbar to commend my grey matter for such effortless work by dousing it with some grey-cell exterminant: alcohol. My immensely talented brain however, knew that this was the exact course that I would take after each and every exam, so it decided to lower my immune system just a tad bit, so that a very sneaky cold could sneak in, and immediately get to work. Thus, thwarting my celebratory plans of a chilled vodka cranberry. What it didn't anticipate was Plan B... cough medicine.  Cough medicine? At a bar? Sure, codeine is a great trip and all, but what kinda bar sells that shit for real? Nopes, my concept of cough medicine consists of a huge dose of brandy, some hot water and a slice of slightly squeezed lemon. The brandy warms you up instantly. The hot water is exactly the opposite of cold water. And the lemon slice contains a fair amount of Vitamin C. Also, if there happens to be any around, some honey... the sweet stuff in jars, not chicks, although they would be greatly appreciated too. But I dare not ask the bar staff, as I fear they would not extend their gracious services unto me anymore.  Speaking of Absinthe, was watching Nine Inch Nails' "Perfect Drug" video for the nth time today. Finally decided to do a little research and reading on the history of Absinthe. Like weed, there's a bit of paraphernalia and preparation methods involved. Also like weed, the stuff is supposed to spark some real creative shit off. And even more like weed... it's green. Most surprisingly, a glass of Absinthe (just recently legalised in Switzerland, home of the best Absinthe) can be purchased at the Vesbar. So, that's now my post-exam agenda for Thursday... brain-permitting of course.
