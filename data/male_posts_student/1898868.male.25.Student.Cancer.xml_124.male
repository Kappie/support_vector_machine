Most of my posts have focused, rather predictably, on myself, my escapades, or my travails during the previous/ upcoming weekends. Today, I will abscond my largely hedonistic and self-indulgent posts in favor of a well organized political treatise. And so it begins:  The recent debate regarding the Federal Gay Marriage Amendment is of particular concern to me. I am completely in favor of legalizing two-person marriage in all forms: women marrying men, men marrying men, women marrying women, and transgenders marrying each other.  In 1996, a Republican Congressional Majority passed the "Defense of Marriage Act" which had little policy implications but placed Democrats on the record on the subject of gay marriage. Barney Frank, an openly gay Massachusetts Congressman, encouraged Democrats who faced close elections in November '96 to vote for the bill (contrary to Frank and the LGBT community's interest) because it was designed as a "wedge issue" for Democrats. Republicans used the DOMA to retain their majority in both houses of Congress.  Fast forward to 2004, where the issue of gay marriage has raced to the forefront of our social consciousness. Massachusetts is again playing a large role in this tale-- its Supreme Court threw down the gauntlet and effectively legalized gay marriage within the Commonwealth. This drew a swarm of criticism from Republicans across the country, and spurred the party of Lincoln to take a drastic measure: the proposition of a Federal Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage.  One steadfast common characteristic of most Republicans, especially those living in the Western states, is their distaste of government intrusion in their lives. They value liberty in the true sense of the word: lower taxes, less gun regulations, less constraints on their livelihood. Classical liberalism is especially attractive when you look at how it comports with the American ideals of individualism and self-reliance. However, the social conservative wing of the Republican party has been slowly driving the party to a less consistent ideological view. The new majoritarian Republican holds a strange concoction of differing and sometimes conflicting ideologies. For example, the "moral" wing of the party rails against the right to an abortion while at the same time assailing government gun regulation.  In defense of this line of thinking, I don't think consistency is necessary in political viewpoints. I also don't think classical liberalism has been the center of the Republican Party's ideology for quite some time. But I do think that any vestiges of social classical liberalism to which the Republican Party was holding on have now been cut by their extremely virulent opposition to gay marriage.  The Gay Marriage Amendment was spearheaded by first term Colorado Congresswoman Marilyn Musgrave, a social conservative among social conservatives. Along with other gay marriage opponents, she uses "the sanctity of marriage" as an  a priori  claim against the practice of gay marriage. She claims that marriage is "only between a man and a woman."  To me, this is total, unequivocal bullshit.  Some opponents of gay marriage argue that if we expand the definition of marriage to include gay marriage, there will be nothing to stop us from granting marriage licenses to polygamists. This argument has two problems. First, it uses the faulty "slippery slope" argument, which presupposes little or no discipline among actors. For example, we have (un)successfully limited marriage to a man and a woman for 225+ years. It is irrational to assume that we cannot limit it after expansion only because of the expansion itself. Second, polygamy is fundamentally different than two person marriage. Polygamy is fundamentally grounded on a power relationship rather than love. Men often take wives younger than 18. and some wives are as young as 14. For an eye-opening study of polygamy, see Jon Krakauer's  Under the Banner of Heaven,  which details the foundations and consequences of polygamy.  Other opponents of gay marriage, including Dr. Laura, buttress their views by citing Leviticus 18:22, which condemns homosexuality as an abomination.  To me, it does not make any sense to interpret Leviticus literally.  A widely circulated e-mail that can be found here:  urlLink http://www.laughparty.com/view.php?id=946sort=2  demonstrates that Leviticus also prevents eating shellfish and promotes the ownership of slaves.  But why, then, should we support gay marriage?  From a philosophical viewpoint, I think that the US government would not be  granting a right  if it legalizes gay marriage. Rather,  it is presently preventing a right  from being actualized. This is an important distinction: as a country, we are denying a natural right to our citizens, one that is included in our core natural rights of life,  liberty , and property. Any Millsian liberal (and one does not need to be a classical liberal or an offshoot of a classical liberal to advocate gay marriage) will recognize that we should not curtail another's liberty if it does not curtail our own. The Right's promotion of the supposed "moral good" does not justify the gay marriage ban because even if Musgrave's neighbor is a married gay man, this surely does not curtail her liberty.  Second, I believe that it is morally incumbent upon our society to grant the LGBT community the ability to marry. It comports with every fundamental overriding ideal in both our moral and political world: right to contract, tolerance, individual freedom, and love. It does not comport with one blurb in Leviticus. But if you look at the message of every religion, every faith, and every moral code, the base ideals of each support the ability of gays to marry.  So what to do?  Now that the Gay Marriage Ban Amendment has been defeated- not soundly, but defeated nonetheless-- we should look to engage the American public in this debate. This is a good first step in the process, because if we get people talking, and expose them to both sides of the debate, we will surely win. So my immediate exhortation: Start talking about this with your friends, neighbors and family, and encourage them to talk about it with others. We can start a groundswell of public opinion that will overtake the Marilyn Musgrave's, Tom DeLay's and George W. Bush's. We can and we will.  I have long characterized the fight for gays to marry as the biggest fight civil rights fight of our generation-- the generation that grew up in the '80's; the children of 10 Yard Fight, Super Soakers, and Garbage Pail Kids. Our parents took sides in many fights: they were either supporters or or opponents of Vietnam, and they were either supporters or opponents of the civil rights movement. I'm sure our parents have subjected us to different versions revisionist history. All of them (according to them) were on the correct side of the Civil Rights movement, and all of them found it outrageous that more wasn't being done at the time. Both my parents have told me that they were on the right side of the Civil Rights movement. My father has even told me stories about him sitting in a room with Jesse Jackson at the '68 convention. This makes me enormously proud; I have absolutely no doubt that my father's story is true, and I'm sure everyone has heard stories like this from their parents in one form or another.  My point is this: We can either sit on the sidelines and watch the right to marry get trampled by a motivated but incorrect minority. Or we can engage, organize, and get our hands dirty.   History will certainly judge our generation on our fight for or against the right for gays to marry. We can either send a message of tolerance or one of exclusion. We can either win the battle or stand on the sidelines. I, for one, would love to tell my children that I fought the good fight.   You could rally for change in your neighborhood, in your church, or in your battleground state. Or you could just do this:  urlLink http://www.fthevote.com
