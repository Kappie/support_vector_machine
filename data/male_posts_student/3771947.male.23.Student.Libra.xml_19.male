Actually I know the reason but you would think that with only four hours of sleep I would be dead tired, but my mind is in a million places.  Thursday we stopped at Myrtle, got a hotel at Broadway and went out. I got really drunk and tore some sign off a building and got chased, Andy picked up some girl and got a hand job.  Friday we got to the island, went out Friday  Saturday night to Charleston, nothing to exciting except when Andy drove the loaner car drunk into forty barrels on the side of the road - messed it up pretty bad. I did meet a Georgetown alumni who invited me to a party at his house in Georgetown on the 27th. He is really well connected at the school and I can't believe my luck in running into such a cool guy.  All in all it was a good time, I needed to get away. I drank way to much, but that's what vacations are for right? I was a COMPLETE angel, and I still managed to get dumped as did Andy. I had a bad feeling about this trip. I guess I am looking for a girl who will one day go on vacation with me. I am so sick of the "single" life, Andy can't understand. The only thing that really sucked was I dropped my new phone in the ocean and they wont let me get insurance on it.  tomorrow is court, it is not going to trial. I had to call all of my witness' and friends to tell them not to come. I guess the DA must be plea bargaining.
