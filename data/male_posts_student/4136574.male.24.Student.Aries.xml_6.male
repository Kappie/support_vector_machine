She is a door closer, and me a door opener.  Once we shared an open house, but it wasn't like Elissa to be that way, she was just giving in for me.  After 3 years she decided to shut a door.  Any attempt by me to clean up that area was an attack and she has hated me for trying to help since.  Even before we began dating we were falling in love and becoming closer.  I relate to people by looking into them and finding out who they are.  Lisa says I see into people's spirits.  That is pretty much what I think but with a different label.  Anyway, Elissa was in love and letting physical or emotional ties bend her.  She's always let things bend her person.  She became what she thought I wanted her to be for a long time.  When she started closing off sections of herself again, and I started trying to help her open back up with the person she said she loves, it was viewed as an attack.  She became defensive and started to lie.  Suddenly the room was closed for termite inspection.  Later she told me it wasn't closed, it was removed and that was really just a back door.  The lies began shrinking what we had together.  After 3 years, as both friends and lovers, of roaming around together in that emotional house, I just didn't understand.  I tried to get in and fully love again.  I tried to get to her problems and fix them.  I was met with lies.  Now that we're broken up, I am still me, pushing away.  There's still that comfort for me between us for some reason.  But no more lies.  She's open to hating me for it now.  That book is closed and I need to stop reading it.  It's so hard when she's sitting there saying she's lonely and has nobody to talk to, then yells me head off for doing exactly what she needs.  I need to stop pushing open the doors of truth.  Because I know she won't start opening them again.
