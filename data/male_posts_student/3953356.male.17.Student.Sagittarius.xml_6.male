Well, me being me, I continued to question said Sean about the exploits. And it seems our not so great friend had told a few porkies. This Sean boy told me they had only kissed. No titties were shown and no bulge was felt.  However this may be his efforts to hide the humiliation of having had an intimate session avec "she's not that great" girl. I have put acroos both arguements and are letting you decide your story. On a lighter note, Simon Sladen walked past me today in Currys. Seeing as he works there that doesn't seem like a coincidence!  Also, my badge collection will be building as I will be recieving a 'Camerai' badge! I will be 'Camerai the Guest Relations Manager'! Thank You Hilton! Anyway. I shall allow you to continue with your lemming lives. Chow Chikidies!
