Yeah, had one of those today - got a little misty, for a second I thought I was lose it in the utility room I was painting :P  When am I ever gonna get that girl out of my head...?  Anyway...if anyone wants more details than that you're gonna have to ask, 'cause that's definitely all I'm putting about that on here. :P
