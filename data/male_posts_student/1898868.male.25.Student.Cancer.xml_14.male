Not a big deal, but maybe one of you could copy and paste them from the e-mail (assuming you haven't deleted such priceless stuff yet)?  Thanks, bros.  And thanks for getting this up and going, Joel!  Oh yeah - here's an idea: Joel and I were talking about all those crazy celebrities who just "love" the Los Angeles Lakers (like Jack Nicholson).  Obviously nobody takes those guys seriously, and thinks that they really give a shit.  So it would be pretty funny if when the Lakers lose one of them kills themself!
