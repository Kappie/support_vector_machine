That day will never leave my memory. I haven't felt the heat from the sun in a long while.  Now is now.  I would have spent the rest of my life with her.I would have married her. I would have had kids with her. I would have grown old with her. I would have died for her. I would have died next to her. I would have done whatever it takes. I would have gone to any lengths.  I did whatever it took, I tried as hard as I could, I stooped to a level lower than I should have, and still, I failed. To this very day I have not been with the one that I truly love. I haven't experienced it. I have barely experienced love. Do I even know what love is? I figure I do, as every human experiences love. It is universal. To not understand it is to not be human. That does not change the fact that I have not experienced it. I haven't.  Who was the asshole that said "It is better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all"? Hm? Do you know where I stand, I stand horridly in-between. Dancing hopelessly around the equinox of that famous statement. I have loved, yet I have not really experienced it; I'm in love right now, but I am not with her. In a sense I have never loved at all.I have lost, too. I have lost people I have cared about, I have lost heart and hope. I have been deprived. That's damn close to losing, don't you think? Now...Now I feel I am truly losing. I feel I am falling apart, that I've become cold and indifferent. For fuck's sakes, I actually considered packing up my things and leaving all (or, the few that I still have) of my friends. What kind of shit is that?   It feels like April again. It feels like it is happening all over again. That day, when I saw her face the way it was, It changed me forever. I can, I will, never forget those eyes. I do not even understand what they meant to say. But no, it's not April, Simply close to it. The eve of April. Soon the showers will come to wash away the malice. Or drown me one more time.
