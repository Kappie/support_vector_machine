I basically did nothing in the morning, around 6, I went to Keith's and then we went to Sports Plus which was completely boring because there was nobody there. We saw Garrett Berger, jesus he changed...if you ever see him again because he said he's coming back in 11th, you'll see how he changed. Ok, then I slept at Keith's, I beat Keith up. Hah! Then we woke up obviously...haha I spelt woke up like whoke up but I corrected it. I'm so dumb, either that or my hand slipped. I don't think when I type, my hands go on their own. Anyways, we played Halo, well I played Halo alot, we had some bagels, went in the pool and invented the coolest pool game ever with pool floats, then went in the hot tub. Then the rest was torture as we walked and ran about 10 miles. Originally our destination was Ashley's house from Hauppauge but we had no time because I had to go at 4. We went to 711 (KEITH YOU WON THE BET!) I bet Keith there wasn't a 711 on Jeriko, but I was talking one that was close by, this one was a million miles away but we finally got there. THERE WERE NO DAMN SLURPEES! haha I spelt damn, damb. I'm thinking of dumb...oh god I'm confused. Ok, so we had to go all the way back another way and by the end I was dead. My stomache was killing me. I don't know why, I'm so out of shape these days. We finally arrived back at Keith's and in perfect timing, my mom came a few minutes after we got there. Then I bought the new Alien Ant Farm CD, and then went to the Ducks Game as a family. We had to leave early because tomorrow is SIX FLAGS with my awesome cousins! Then, the next two days I'll be in Montauk with my mom's friend and her family. I'll be back Saturday night probably. And on Sunday I'll probably be hanging out with Pat and Dan since a long time. Good times...I hope it starts again. Ok visitors of this lame site...I have to play with the matrix.com and hack into secret binary hexagramic codes to see secret not yet released trailers of The Matrix Relovutions...ok bye!
