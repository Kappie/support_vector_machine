Every small detail, the houses I see, faces I should remember, the valiant pen fights with Stui, how I felt when I saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the first time. It's a tradgedy you never remember the small things. That's what I hope this diary will help out with, a vague recollection of events, enough to recreate a small world. They say that your life flashes before your eyes just as you are about to die. I personally think that's a little unfair, you've lived x amount of years, and for all those years, millions of hours, billions of seconds, you get a mere flash of your life? Or is it a Hollywood style moment when the world around you slows, and a million life times could fill that very second... And, if it is true you see your life flash before your eyes, is it a chain reaction of neurons sending off bursts of messages?  *phew* Babble babble babble...   School  Got a Distinction for computing... Oh, yay... 96th percentile of state... Oh, yay... Proves nothing worth knowing...  I should be getting skipped forward for computing studies anyway. Doing some online training courses, which should turn out useful.  And yep, still staring at my crush... Staring staring staring =P (and a theory has been proposed to me that I will never be "on the inside", but I rebutted the theory stating that I have never had an aim of being on the inside, and anyone worth discussion on the inside is therefore abducted out of it =P)  I also started on a map today, of a purely fictional world called Enanami. Quite amazing what a few random squiggles and ideas can turn into, a world full of rogue continents, Aganthean trading oceans, a single mine spanning over continents and the everpresent threat of the trade ships being raided by pirates =P   And now...  Now I'm up, with my mum sitting in the next room waiting for me to do my homework. Hmmm... I've finished memorising Latin (takes like 2 minutes), but, well, the rest'll take a while =P It's annoying, she's staying up of 'her own free will', and later dad will blame me for keeping her up. And she just said I have ten minutes. Ten minutes. I guess she doesn't know I stay up till midnight  every night  then. Neither does my dad. Just a hint for any adults reading out there, putting a limit on a teenager is like wrapping a noose around your own head, not smart nor suggested. I do go to bed at midnight every night, I know what my body and mind can take, yet they don't trust my own judgement.  No time for creativity tonight, but I think the map did the same task pretty well. Oh, and last night, while up at night drawing, I came up with the idea of a small figure (tribesman, and small meaning two inches) who religously sticks a fork into a 240V socket =P They believe that they are electrocuted by the mighty deities for a job well done on earth, and that the smoke rising from the steaming ashes/corpse is the soul finding it's final resting place =) Well, it's good to dream...  Anyway, fare the well for tonight, I have to work my way around parents/homework/music... It'll be fine though, it always works out in the end.
