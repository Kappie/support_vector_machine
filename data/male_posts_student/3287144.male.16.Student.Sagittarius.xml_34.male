I mean I spent all my money yesterday and I don't have a job which leaves me with nothing to do as I can't afford to do it really as I don't want to use money from my guitar/camera fund.  Oh well, enough of my troubles; Today while hopping around channels I discovered on BBC4 was Brian Wilson [of The Beach Boys] doing a live performance of the Pet Sounds album with his new 10 piece band...  wouldn't it be nice  if he could still hit those high notes, which he unfortunately can't and so I ended up flicking over to the ever-reliable 'Bid Up TV' - as the name suggests its an auction on TV but it is one of the funniest things ever!  The average presenter is a bit of a flop and that’s the only reason why they are working there is because they aren't really top quality but they do work their hearts out on it all. However the presenters are nothing compared to the audience; despite selling all manner of rubbish, people ALWAYS bid, and this is the odd part; it costs £1 to bid, so instead of putting in a safer high bid, at the start people will bid the minimum £1. I have  never  seen anything go for £1, so why do they think today should be any different?  Poor misguided bidders... speaking of which I hopefully will be bidding on a camera on eBay. Poor misguided me.
