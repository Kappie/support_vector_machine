Anyway, here it is:  Have you seen or heard of the movie "Sweet Home Alabama"? It looks reALly stupid, but when translated into contemporary Allish (in which whenever there is an "a" or an "l" you add an "l" or an "a", respectively, so that it becomes Al) it reads "Sweet Home ALALALBALMAL"!  I hear "The Tuxedo" is out. I have plenty of people who I could see it with, but I don't know who I should invite. If anyone reading this blog wants to go, tell me.  It's officiAL: My least favorite class is French. My teacher is reALly evil and a little... off. I can't wait until next year when I don't have to have her anymore.  I got my pocket Constitution! It's reALly cool, and I can whack people with it! Go Republic (that statement does not imply my support of this government, this Administration, AL of our laws, AL of those rednecks, or AL of those stupid, commercialist, naive, Republican, or New-Agey people)!
