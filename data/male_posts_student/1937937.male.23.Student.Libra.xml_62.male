There are like seven channels on cable devoted to spreading ways in which we might get attacked.  That's so pathetic -- why don't we all go out and eat a few McDonald's hamburgers and forget about it.  I'm so sick of this bullshit.  Our Fear-Driven Economy: three out of seven commercials on one break during the Rush Limbaugh show suggested we'd die young unless we bought some product.  "Cortislim: The Scientific Centerpiece of your Healthy Exercize Regiment".  "Today, Iraq will be reborn".  "Farmer kills neighbor in property dispute".  "Insurgency".  "Iraqi Military".  "One pill a week can help reverse bone loss".  "I'm in a seven-forty fizzai".  What a country.  Yet I reap the benefits!  Yet, what are the benefits?  What makes me happy?  A nice place to live?  A computer?  A job?  School?  God is sufficient in disposal of affairs.
