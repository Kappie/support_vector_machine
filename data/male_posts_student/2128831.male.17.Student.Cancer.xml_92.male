Sticks and stones may break my bones, blah, blah, etc. One of my work pals told me she discovered that she isn't as straight as she thought. After looking up the word "queer," she determined that it really did suit her. I now consider myself in good company. Way to go, Whew! When I sat down to think of a catchy name for this blog (mind you I have not one creative molecule in my body), I couldn't shake the concept of zen as it relates to the transition in achieving one's potential. Then the notion of queerness arose and I thought, "Shazam! A perfect example of lifelong transition!" (One never stops "coming out.") You see, there's been a controversy in the gay community for decades, centering on the notion of deliberately referring to ourselves as dykes, fags and queers. As the argument went, reclaiming those terms would eventually remove the concomitant stigma when said terms were flung by detractors. Well, I've never understood how [what amounts to be] self-deprecation could dull the razor-sharp pain of being called something that dictionaries categorize as derogatory slang.  However, popular notions of what it means to be queer have flexed with time. In the U.S., "queer" in the 30s or 40s meant "odd" or "strange." It only recently became synonymous with homosexuality and, because of that association, I always shied away from using it. On the other hand, there is NO ambiguity about "dyke" or "fag." [Remember grade school?] My journey then, is ... Queerly Zen. and even if I weren't a gay, I'd still call myself queer.   [w]ri[t]ers on the storm-   I was standing between the highway and the ocean in light rain, with puddles and rainbows all over the asphalt. Elbows on the metal guard-rail and students all over the scene. I close my eyes and I'm so close to the ocean that I can hear it but I open my eyes up and it's just the endless stream of traffic. I open my eyes up and instead of surf hitting sand it's rubber slapping puddles. Manufactured metal bodies speed by and they never once wander from their trajectories, like bullets set to flight. They roar, grandiose like nature, and we don't hear the ocean anymore, just commuters. Some lady who looked yellow all over who gets on the bus on the Bedford highway, who makes a silent fuss and blocks everyone's routine. Some boy with thick black dreads for hair and dressed all in blue looks sullen and blank, looks perfect for a bus stranger. Yellow blocks blue and sets his head spinning with brown buildings and intersections. Yellow gets off a minute later, chomping gum like she's trying to graw on the air. Blue mumbles and figures it all out and when he gets off the bus he runs across the street to try it all over again. (I know because I was there and I wanted to open my mouth but the smile wouldn't come and he just ran anyway)    Top ten reasons why Will didn't Blog lately…   10.
