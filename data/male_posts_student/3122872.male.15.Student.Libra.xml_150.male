I'm not sure why I'm actually writing this at all, but I might as well, since there's nothing better to do...   Monday   Half 5 wake up call as we were leaving at half 6,  took another arbitrarily long bus journey to Washington DC...  We've been lucky so far in that everytime that we've got on the coach, it starts raining, and when we arrive at our destination, the weather suddenly turns sunny...No idea why, but it happens...:/  Unfortunately, as soon as we set foot on the Lincoln Memorial, the heavens opened  and decided that sprinklers were out, buckets are better for disposing of water...  This continued on for the rest of the day, you'll see what I mean when I get back home and upload some pictures...  Back to the hotel after that...   Tuesday   Got up at 4 AM...not exactly the most fun I've ever had..  No... wait, not 4AM, 3AM...  The alarm clock in the hotel was an hour fast...  No idea what happened for the rest of the day, wandered about in semi-daze...  and suddenly I'm back home again...  Meh...
