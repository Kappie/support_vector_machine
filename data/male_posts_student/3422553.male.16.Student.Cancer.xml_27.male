The one that affects da sox the most would have to be shipping away Nomar Garciaparra in a four team trade getting in return first basemen Doug Mientkiewicz and to take Nomar's spot on the field, Orlando Cabrera.  Da sox defence has been killing them as of late and General Mangager Theo Epstein thought that it would be wise to ship Nomar and his contract that ended at the end of the season somewhere else since he already rejected at the start of the season an extenstion to his contract.  Da sox also aquired a speedy outfield by the name of Dave Roberts who has thirty-three steals in thirty-four trys, not bad.  The Sox will have little or no problems with out Nomar in the lineup and look ready to win the World Series!
