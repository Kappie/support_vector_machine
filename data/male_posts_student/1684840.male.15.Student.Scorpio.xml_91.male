School has been as boring as ever, apart from that day where the class had to disect real organs from farm animals.  I nearly puked that day!  Or maybe the day when Mrs. Humphreys locked us all in the cooking room and kept us all back for no reason.  Maybe it could have been that time when Checketts fell over the whiteboard (daft cow)!  So maybe it was an eventful 23 days since my last post after all.  Beagle is lost on Mars, while the NASA Spirit rover is on a rocky hospital bed while it is being operated on (techno. surgeon and patient being 104M Kilometers apart of course).  Opportunity lands tomorrow!  Poor Beagle eh, the Brit's one big chance to hit the limelight and they've blown it... or have they?  They have one last chance on Monday, then it's classed as Lost!!  Freak weather conditions forecast for next week... (YESS!!!).  School may be cancelled if they shut down the motorway... Ha! In a million years.... :o(  Heavy snow and temperatures of -14 are expected!!!  Hopefully this is enough to cover England a few thousand feet hehe.  Snow tunnels for all!
