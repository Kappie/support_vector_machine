I've been offline for two days thanks to my marvelous Internet company that I'm leaving in a few days. And damn glad about that.    I've spent the day at home but at least it didn't turn out into a depressing day like last Sunday. I've been packing some of my things while listening to Belinda Carlisle and watched tv for a while [why summer tv is sooooo crappy??!!] I'm going out tomorrow, or at least that's what we've planned. My friend Fran has invited me and Julia to go to his pool tomorrow. It's gonna be fun, that's for sure. We've gotten closer over this month cause the rest of our little group is out of the town, so we meet every day to take a long walk around the city while we talk about anything and share a Coke or eat candy.      Oh, I have to tell you about yesterday. We were at McDonald's because Julia wanted to get something to drink. Everything was just fine until I saw *him* standing on the door. It's hard to explain who's that *him* in a few words. Basically, he's a guy I "met" in school and I've been fancing him for two years and a half. He's handsome. He's tall. He's intelligent. He's gay. He's single. He's a friend of my brother [not a close one, but they have some mutual friends] Sounds great, uh? The sad part is that I've never had the guts to tell him about my feelings. The people who know about him keep telling me that I'll always regret about that, and they're absolutely right. But I guess that everyone has acted like this with their first serious crush, right?    As you can see at the top of the post, I've started a countdown. I like countdowns [yes, I know it's weird] and I'll make one every time I have something important to wait about. I'm also listing my favorite song[s] of the moment. Just for the sake of sharing.    See you,    Santi
