So, due to my recent bout of insomnia, I foolishly went to Michael Moore's website and what do you know...the blood started boiling! So he has this list of what he says are "facts" (and I use that word VERY loosely) that are presented in his so-called movie Farenheit 911. Anyway...so here's the first fact he has listed:     FAHRENHEIT 9/11:   Fox was the first network to call Florida for Bush. Before that, some other networks had called Florida for Gore, and they changed after Fox called it for Bush.       Todd:   What? I'm sorry what's that you say? Why yes, last I checked the news networks didn't decide who is elected to office, the people do! What a shocking surprise!    Let's continue down his list, and mind you that was just the first one.     FAHRENHEIT 9/11:   Gore got the most votes in 2000.       Todd:   Can someone call hell and see if it froze over?! Michael Moore got something partially correct. I'm more than willing to tell you that Gore won the popular vote, but Bush won the Electoral College, which is the deciding factor in United States Presidential Elections.  So get over it! Life's too short to hold grudges.        So back to his "facts"    FAHRENHEIT 9/11:   “On the day George W. Bush was inaugurated, tens of thousands of Americans poured into the streets of D.C. They pelted Bush’s limo with eggs.”    Todd:   Could this be a new trend? Now, can someone explain to me why Michael Moore would choose to include this? All it shows is that Democrats are sore losers and very disrespectful to the President. Can you imagine how the Democrats would react if someone threw an egg at John Kerry's limo? All hell would break loose. Such hypocrisy. By the way...he states as his fact (see above) that "They pelted Bush's limo with egg s ." Notice that pluralness on eggs. Now let's take a look at the facts HE PROVIDED to back up this statement:      “Scuffles erupted between radicals and riot police while an egg struck the bullet-proof presidential limousine as it carried Mr. Bush and wife Laura to the White House.” Damon Johnston, “Bush Pledges Justice as Critics Throw Eggs,” The Advertisers, January 22, 2001.      AN EGG! AN EGG! Michael Moore caught in ANOTHER LIE! Will it ever end??!!?!!    Ok well Im beat so I'm going to bed now..but rest assured there is more to come...    Todd
