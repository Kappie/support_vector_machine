He said that we could do the homework if we felt like it, it's no big deal.  He played music during class and George calls him a hippie (he had him for stats last year).  Jonny and Jacob Fleming are in my class; I'm surprised at how little they've both spoken (with Jonny's nerdiness (no offense) and Phlegm's sassmouth).  I have math in the same room as last year, but for some reason the chalk squeaks now (I wrote my answers to a problem on the board) when it didn't before.  My English class seems pretty average, in terms of room, assignments, and teacher.  My teacher, Ms. Kraines, says we'll be doing a lot of analysis... ugh.  Why can't we just read books without dissecting?  I've had one essay so far, 2.5 pages.  Banjo's in my class, by the way.  TV Production (teacher: Ms. Rossman) looks like it'll be fun and educational without that time-consuming.  So far we've talked about different shots and the politics of the media.  It seems like I'm the only one raising my hand in that class.  It also looks as if I'll be able to work from home since they have the latest Mac technology (yay!).  French was OK.  Ian and Ostrogoth are in my class.  The work looks ordinary, like last year.  The only problem is that my teacher, Mme. DeRobert, talks very softly while the air conditioning is running loudly; Ian didn't hear a word she said (which was a problem since he didn't hear the homework assignment).  I'm not sure whether she's French or just of Frankish descent; she hasn't said anything in English so far but all French teachers do that on the first day.  History was good too.  My teacher, Ms. Heidlage, is Charlie's mother.  It looks pretty much the same as last year except this time, the teacher seems to know about history and we might actually learn in class instead of just from the textbook.  Loren's in my class.  Chemistry, I'm not so sure about.  Ian, Richie, and that British kid Matt are in my class.  The teacher, Ms. Srikanth, has been nice so far but I have a feeling she's going to be strict.  Our class is mostly juniors.  I was miffed because on this homework sheet we did based on this "Safety Contract," some of the questions weren't covered on the contract and required a knowledge of chemistry to answer, like "True or False: Never clean up an acid with a base."  I haven't taken Chemistry before, how am I supposed to know?  Overall, it looks like I'll be doing homework all day (I've already had two essays and the equivalents of two more).  But I'll manage.  You're reading the words of a writing master.
