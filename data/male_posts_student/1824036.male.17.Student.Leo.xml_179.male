I have my guitar in my lap and I am pausing to play every now and then.  My fingers are getting really callused over big time and they hurt really bad... ISN'T IT GREAT!!!  The other day I was at the local coffee shop getting a mocha and  urlLink Jody Hawkins  came in and played guitar...I was amazed. He can play it all. Ive heard him play rock and roll, but he was playing classical and jazz that day. He is a stud and a half...  It would be awesome to be just like him :)
