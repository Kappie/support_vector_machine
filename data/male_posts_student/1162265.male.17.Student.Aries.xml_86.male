After school (and Gaia), I walked out towards Rite-Aid, when my Aunt drove by and picked me up.  She asked if I wanted to go to Kings and I was like "What the Hell".  So I asked her why she doesn't go to PathMark and she says because she needs a rest after work.  So, we go to Kings get her stuff, and she starts arguing with the Cashier.  That was slightly funny, but she was annoyed because she didn't want to be treated "black" by a black woman. Oh well.  Got my camp pictures.  No pictures of any girls!  Dammit! Oh well.....   So today I noticed something, and am like "Well this is the end of that...." That's cool though.  I can deal with that the problem is previous obligations.... I can deal though.  I'm a happy person.  Why the hell does this crap always happen in the Spring?
