When we arrived, it was pouring with rain, but luckily we were prepared with long trousers and coats. We met our guide and had a short break before setting off in the coach. The mountain was an hours drive away, in quite a remote area. At times it was raining so hard the road was like a river. I was a bit worried about the coach getting swept away, but we arrived safe and sound in the end.  Wrapped up to the eyeballs in waterproofs, we made our way to the entrance. We were packed into a large cable car and started our ascent. The cable car took us up about half way, which was just above the cloud line. The view here was incredible, and above the clouds, there was no rain... Perfect!  We first walked up to our hotel (about 1500+ metres up) where we checked in and put some luggage in our rooms. After a quick lunch, our tour guide started to take us around.  I really can't describe the mountain in words, everyone will have to wait for the pictures. From about 2pm to 6pm we were climbing and walking to various points. There was one point where there was a vertical rock on the top of a small summit. We were able to walk to the top, i was very scared because there was a small handrail between me and a sheer vertical drop into the clouds. The view was truly spectacular, even though i was practically frozen to the spot in terror!  At the end of the day, we climbed up to the top of that mountain where the highest point was 1800 metres up. From here we could see all the points we'd visited earlier below us. After pausing for some pictures, we came back to the hotel where we watched the sun go down under the clouds while we ate our dinner.  Fantastic :)  (very hard work though, and there's more tomorrow)  oh, and unexpectedly, i have good mobile reception up here - so i can continue my diary after all.
