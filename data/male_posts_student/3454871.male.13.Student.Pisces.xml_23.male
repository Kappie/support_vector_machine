He's really fun to hang around with and when I do I get really excited. Sometimes Winnee reads to me. About stuff like tomatoes and beets. Those are my favorite things to eat. Beats make me sneeze a lot so recently I've cut off eating them. I was so sad when my mom told me I couldn't eat them. I just started crying and crying. At one point I thought about killing myself but* that all changed when mommy brought home some wingdings for me to eat. They are really quite yummy. YUM YUM YUM wingdings. I have a major crush on Hitler. He's such a sexy beast! You so sexy man!"
