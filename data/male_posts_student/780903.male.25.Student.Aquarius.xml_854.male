You're welcome.  To the person who found this site by googling "obese husband" -- I don't what you were thinking of.  Maybe try match.com.  To the person who found this site by googling "identify pill T7" -- I'm sorry, I don't know what pill T7 is.  You probably shouldn't take it until you find out though.  Go ask your pharmacist.  To the person who reached this site from the domain "PaulBunyan.net" -- I would have had something funny to say, except when I clicked on PaulBunyan.net I realized it was just a phone company.  Oh well.  Enjoy.
