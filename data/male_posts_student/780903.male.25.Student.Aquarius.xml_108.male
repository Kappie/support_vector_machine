Someone had told me "never take the Orange line."  Now I know why.  No, seriously, it was nothing.  But clearly this place had never seen educated people before.  It was full of middle-aged drunk people with beards (even the women) and plaid shirts.  I don't know what that means, I'm just trying to paint a picture here.
