Coll lay asleep at my feet, shivering with cold.  while awake, he had insisted that i take our only blanket.  i was suddenly almost too exhausted to move, watching him chatter his teeth and curl up to block out the cold.  it couldnt hurt for just one night, i thought blearily as drowse crept onto the edges of my mind, it couldnt hurt to sleep.    *                             *                                         *      I almost did it. i almost relaxed enough to fall asleep beside him, curled under the shelter of our one ragged excuse for a blanket.  that showed a lamentable lack of control on my part.  it wouldnt happen again, however; in the morning i would be gone.  he could pull out his stitches himself."  -if you want more, just ask!!! oh and btw, im not really back.  im sitting in the library typing this up right now.  still no internet at my house, but im trying to get some service. -book of the week: the course of honor by lindsey davis -song of the day: i am a highway by audioslave -bye all!
