I need about $188.00 to fly to Manitoba...But without taxes, surcharges, fuel fees, NAVCAN, Airport Improvement Fees, and Security Charges it would only be $144.00. AND THATS A BIT MORE AFFORDABLE!! I don't suppose any of you reading this would like to borrow or donate to me $50 or $100 or $150??? No? Worth a shot, eh? But seeing this really makes me think, why is travel so expensive! Why don't do better research and find CHEAPER ways to travel as opposed to expensive ones. Bottom line, I need money. Problem with that! Mom can't afford it, there's no money in dad's budget for it, I am not allowed to get a job because it goes on her income tax, noone wants to hire someone like me as a babysitter, and professional services for many household duties and computer repair are very affordable if you find the right place. So what am I to do? My grandparents can't fly me out because they are already finding a way for me to get back! If anyone has any suggestions (OR MONEY, MONEY IS GOOD) please tell me.....I'm, what they call, desperate.
