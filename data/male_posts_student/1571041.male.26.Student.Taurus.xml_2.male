Tonight is the wake, and tomorrow is the funeral.  Sucks that these funerals are coming in a flurry this past month or so.  Well, today woke up all nice and late.  But, got to holla @ Mario once again, but it was to try and get ahold of ole Troy.  Well, didn't happen.  So, I call up Mrs. Adams.  We talk around for awhile and she's got her drama going on.  Not only that, but everyone else has their things going on w/ them too.  Maybe if I was still @ SIPI, things might not be how they are, or maybe they might be worse.  Anyways, things are how they are both @ SIPI, and here @ home:  nice and drama filled.  I decided that I won't even touch, or work on the NHH site for awhile now.  I'm most likely looking at either July or maybe even August to get things going again.  So much has happened, and is going on that I don't have the time to be reworking the layout anymore.  Sucks, but life happens.  Last night was a long night, or I should say early this morning.  It just so happens that my nephew was heading back over to the coast, and my cousin drove a li'l over half way to meet him.  So what happens?  I'm the chauffer that is volunteered to bring li'l man over yonder.  Well, I had nothing better to do, other than wonder what else is going on, and check out ole Direct TV for the rest of the time I'm awake.  Well, I take off around 1:45 a.m. and get there around 3 a.m.  The drive was pretty uneventful since ole boy was sleeping the whole way.  Maybe for the better though, because I didn't mind the time to check out the new cd's I made.  Then, on the way back, stop by ole Wal Mart, and hooked up them gars.  Black N Mild of course.  Got home, lifted weights, and went to bed around 10:00 a.m.  My bro is supposed to be coming around for the funeral, and probably soon, so I'm gonna cut this short and get ready.
