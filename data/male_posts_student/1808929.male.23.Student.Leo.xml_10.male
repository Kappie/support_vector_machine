On Friday night I had a small party at my apartment with about 6 people and we had a lot of fun. We were all really tame though. On Saturday I went to the Fort Worth Jazz Festival with 2 other people. On saturday evening I drove up to Denton where our family got together to celebrate Papa's 80th birthday. We had the party at my cousin David's restaurant at Valley View where I ended up having a very good grilled chicken salad for dinner!

However, there's a lot of stuff going on with my mom's side. I don't really want to get into the nuances of our extended family relations, but it's enough to really stress Mom at times. Being away for four years was great, but I'm glad that I'm able to help her out now that I'm closer. It's odd 'cause I always try to live with the idea that any relationship can be repaired, however times like these really make me see how some people cannot help but grow apart over the years, even if they're sisters.  ["You and Me," Tom Petty, 2002]  This week I will be applying to become a member of the Tarrant County Medical Society. For some reason I have an interest in the "public grievance committee." I have no idea what it does, but I'm hoping to find out soon. Gosh, it would suck ass to be put on a committee that really blew. I need to talk to some people about it.  ["Reasons Why," Nickel Creek, 2000]  In the last week I've talked briefly with a number of my friends from Duke EMS, including Steve Barmach, Jake Woods, and Jen Farrell. I don't have a lot of time to talk usually, but occasionally I do, and when I do I really like keeping in touch with them. It seems to me that the squad's been going through a turbulent month. Those kinds of times really bring out the best and the worst in an organization. I'll be seeing Steve the second week in October, so we'll have plenty of time to chat about stuff.  ["Suite: Judy Blue Eyes," Crosby, Stills, and Nash, 1969]  Gotta sleep now. Gross anatomy starts for me this week!
