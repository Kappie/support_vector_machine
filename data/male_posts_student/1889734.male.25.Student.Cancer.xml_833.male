Time is lessening the impact, but it would be foolish to say that it doesn't mean anything to me.  While I don't feel a constant sense of loss, I do recognize that the person I am now was fundamentally formed in the few years after his loss.  So it has had a tremendous impact on my life, just not a constant, persistent presence as it was so long ago.  I still miss him, and I know there are so many things about today's world he would have loved (especially the net).  But he made a choice, and it can't be undone.
