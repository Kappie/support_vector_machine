Not only can you blog to your hearts content, you can now blog alongside your trusted friends and companions!  Isn't that right  Nick ?  For previous readers of our blogs ( Nick's "Go Ahead and Read This If You Dare"  and my  "Punk Rock Editorial" ), you know that, by reading our blogs you are able to catch a glimpse of our lives.  Well now you get the best of both worlds.  Now, not only are you able to follow the important events in our lives, but now you'll be able to see the contrasting ideas, the different points of view, and the life of not one person, but two!  Well enough advertising the "grand opening" of  Nick and I's  dual blog...I must confer with  Nick  about future topics worth bloggin' about!
