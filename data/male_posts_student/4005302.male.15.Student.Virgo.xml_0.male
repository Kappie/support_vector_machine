Al Gore was one of the speakers, his job was the voice of experience after "losing" (read Michael Moore's "Stupid White Men" if you don't know what I mean) in 2000. He was pretty typically. . . Al Gore. Which basically means he got his most applause when mentioning Bill Clinton. . . Jimmy Carter was very aggressive without bashing bush, but definitely had some deep stabs at Bush, especially atBush's military "record". Clinton had a very good speech, which far outclassed anything Bush has uttered in the last 4 years. Democrats are looking very good, my faith that they can win this next election is rekindled!!!
