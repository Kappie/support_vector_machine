I love that line... "It's war against the classes, the priveledged few against the masses... a Proletarian Hop that just won't stop."  So last night I heard more about the debauchery that went on in Vegas from Stephanie... heh and I relayed some of it to Cissa and Mike on the boards. I also chatted with Laine last night too... I hope her dog is doing better. Hmm... I sure was talking to a lot of Canadians last night.  Let's see... tonight... I'm gonna go to the VizCult workshop, do some photocopying and maybe watch a NetFlix movie.  ***
