She had the audacity to tell me that I am sinning against God and quoted the Bible and told me I was going to hell for being gay.  I am like ‘hello,’ I didn’t choose to be gay at all, it happens!  It is like my eye colour I didn’t choose it.  I have hazel eye b/c that is my eye colour.  Jeebus, she gave me a frickin’ headache!  I swear!  I am soo pissed.  So, I took some Napyrson and a little nap at Sam's and went home to talk to Jared. He is sooo comforting, another great qauilty of him!  Wow, I feel sheepish: is that a word? I hope so because then I would appear stupid if it wasn't...  I don't care what Frau said. You know what?  Watch out world here comes a flamer!!! I am gonna fall asleep early because I had been up for 44 hours and I was tired as shite.  Shite isn't that a type of Muslim? I am so sexually frustated right now  ... I wish to f someone's brains out alas I can't because I am home from school because I am and tired and don't have the person I wish to have here with me so I will wait until Januray.  *wink, wink, nugde, nudge, tap, tap (smiles)* I a gonna go right now I will write more soon though... I will add more later!!! Much heart to Jared!
