Guess (at least over the past few days) it hasn't been as daily as the title says...  2 exams down, none to go :) -- All I have to do from today (actually yesterday) until tomorrow is just show up at school for any periods that I have a class. No exams, but we have to be there for attendance purposes. Today I have my Computer Science AP class; I think we're watching  Harry Potter and CoS  for the two hour exam period. At least I'm taking my Xbox and that DVD up to the school with that intent. My guess is that 5 kids out of our class will show up. Granted, that's an extremely high percentage when we only have a little over 10 anyway, but we'll see.  Another baseball game tonight, and no one thinks it is important enough to tell the trainer when it's time for the bus to leave. 5:00? 5:30? 4:00? I've been told all those times, all by different people. My guess is somewhere between 5:00-5:30, so that's when I'm showing up. If the bus is gone and I get in trouble for it, it's not like there was ever a consensus on when I was supposed to show up. If I do end up going, it will be close to 11:00 before I get home (game ends ~9:30, 1 hour drive home, then cleaning up the stuff and actually driving to my house).  Well, I guess that's about it. Time to entertain myself for about an hour and a half and then leave to go up to the school.
