By the way I've just been fired...'Good heavens why?' I hear you impatiently ask, well its as simple as this - it was my eighth shift and I had not yet brought one customer to the crap consultative that is Anglian Home Improvements. May I just add that I'm over the banana bright bloody moon that I did not get a customer to be conned into some shabby conservatory...Oh yes and for the record, everybody in Great Britain has double glazing, all except Dafydd Jones who lives in a wee one bedroom 'cottage' on a blooming hill in fecking Pontypridd, but good luck getting his number as he only gives it out to the neighbouring farmers who simply have to be avid listeners of BBC Wales!  Fair enough I went a little over the top there, but I mean who needs double glazing these days? Everyone has it! Try and sell some people four inch thick armoured glass...Now there's a seller!...Bloody terrorists...Anyway, back to meeting my friend. I had just nipped into WH Smith to pick up the paper...The Sun newspaper that is. Well to explain the look on my friend's face would be to explain why dolphins don't fart...well at least not to my knowledge. Horror, that's a good word, yes it was definitely horror that was strewn across her face. 'The Sun?!....you...read the...Sun?!' no, actually I don't read The Sun, I like every other man buy The Sun for only one reason and that's to open up that newspaper and stare in awe at.....the daftest bloody responses to peoples problems I've ever heard in my life! Honestly, Deidre Sanders must have it coming to her, she is the silly-est old bint I've ever come across, for example:  Problem - "my boyfriend wants me to have a threesome with him and his mate but I don't                 know what to do, I mean its just so unorthodox"  Advice - "oh I don't like the sound of this, this can only spell trouble, sex always               spells trouble, that's why I've never had any, I don't like trouble me!"  I mean for crying out loud! How can this woman deny people their fun! The bloody woman reels me...and that's why I read The Guardian. Now The Guardian newspaper is a reliable one, good facts and figures, fancy language and its guaranteed to give a giggle - none of these qualities do you find in The Sun.  In any other case I would never had debated the credibility of a newspaper because simply I find most of them a waste of paper - watch the bloody news for crying out loud ! If you watch it on the BBC you get a short Welsh man with a daft accent dictating the doom and gloom in the world, or if you happen to be a poor old sod and have to watch it on ITV then you might just see some exhibitionism in the weather report. I do love the Welsh, they always give me a giggle
