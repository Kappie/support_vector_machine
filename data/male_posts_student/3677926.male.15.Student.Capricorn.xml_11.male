You see, I have been given the task to write a 350 word essay so that I won’t impose Miss Raja’s wrath. The only ideas that came to mind for me were all circling around discipline as that would be Miss Raja and Mr. Yong’s favorite subject matter. Anyway as I was browsing through some of my favorite web pages, I finally had an ideal subject matter that would probably interest the majority of the Seri Surians. ________________________________________________________________________   Young people today, are they selfish and irresponsible?   Before I start my expressing my humble views, I would like to tell you what young people are. The terms “adolescents”, “youths” and “young people” are wrongly used by the majority of people as they think they all signify the same thing but they don’t. Adolescents are aged 10 to 19, youth are aged 15 to 24 and young people are aged 10 to 24.  Now, I strongly disagree with the view that young people are selfish and irresponsible, I am saying that because I as a young person myself believe that young people can be responsible and unselfish. Sitting in front of my computer and writing this essay for the school magazine makes me a responsible student.   Adults have a choice. They can either regard young people as problems or welcome them as partners. Young people themselves assert that they are part of the solution at the World Youth Forum. I quote from a statement taken at the event:  “Young people can and should be a part of the solution to the problems in the world. Youths are not obstacles, but they are invaluable resources for development.”  But sadly, adults chose to regard young people as problems. By the time adolescents face life’s decisive moments like saying yes or no to sexual activity, they are showing great maturity and responsibility when making that decision.  Young people have stamped themselves in the “eye” of the world by voicing their opinions in a step to exterminate problems like HIV/AIDS and sexual matters among other problems facing the world. If that is not showing responsibility, then I don’t have the faintest idea what will?  And I don’t think that young people are selfish. I think that adults are even more selfish than us. Adults show greed, for one. Adults have been known to be involved in corruption, murder, rape among other sinful deeds. What drives them to these despicable acts? Money, sex and power and I don’t believe that young people face these problems.  If the minority of young people is indeed labeled “selfish and irresponsible”, then I believe that it is the fault of the older people. Why do young people rebel? The answer is blatantly simple and easy. It is because older people like teachers and parents don’t show us respect and other values that an older person deserves. Just because we are young, does that mean we don’t deserve basic human rights like privacy and respect? As far as I can see, teachers and parents treat ys as children that don’t know a single thing. I am not trying to say that we know it all but let us learn on how to live our lives for ourselves. If we fail, too bad, we have to get back on our two feet and try again. Like the proverbs say,” failure is the mother of success” and “experience is the best teacher.”  But what can we do to change the mentality or mindset of the people who think that young people are irresponsible and selfish? I can’t say or tell as no adult will take our views seriously as they will think we are just trying to be macho and since most of us just reached puberty, adults will think that our testosterones are beginning to kick in.  With this composition, I hope to change the mentality of certain people and all I can say as a conclusion is that young people are not irresponsible and selfish. People who say that young people are irresponsible and selfish are really “squares” and they obviously have not seen the bigger picture of things.
