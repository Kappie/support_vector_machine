We don't do anything in this class anymore because the AP test is over, and there is no point in doing anything else.  So I have made a decision, i have decided that I hate emotion in general. I wish that humans were more like robots, I mean, when was the last time you heard of a robot who was overwhelmed? it doesnt happen! they are robots! But no, humans have EMOTION, humans have to go around complaining about how life sucks, or go around skipping about how life is great, making the people whos lives suck grow a third arm. Emotion screws everything up, it makes everything complicated, emotion is the reason that we no longer have time.  a poster just fell on my teachers head...  Yet if we didnt have emotion, things would suck even more, except we wouldnt know it... if we didnt have emotion we would never be happy, and although we would also never be sad, it would suck to never be happy. So we lose either way.  YOU LOSE!  I guess I wrote this in light of Brad Duren, he started crying when i told him that he has a rare form of excess skin syndrom in his left neck-area.  current status: tired as helga current blog point: end
