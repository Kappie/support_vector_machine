There are over 4 billion websites included in the Google Search Engine and yet I CANNOT find one single Fan Site for one of my most reverred and respected heroes, the brilliant politician and politcal speaker (Oi! No laughing in the back rows!) that is Mr. Ian Duncan Smith. It is a terrible, terrible tragedy that such a marvel, a pinnacle of human evolution such as IDS does not have AT LEAST one fan site! Hence this blog, I invite all of you HTML programmers out there (well not one of you... eeewww... not YOU!! EEWWW!! Contamination!!) to submit a design for a purposeful and worthy website of our great hero, Ian Duncan Smith.   urlLink     urlLink     Have Fun Ye All, Martin J.  PS: This is a highly serious venture, should any uncontaminated HTML programmer find their way across this Blog of Royalty then I would ask you to submit the design for your website to either my own (Marineena's)  email address or Steph's (Captain Howdy), both of which *should* be found in our profiles. Should we find a design worthy of the great political genious that is IDS we will endeveour to create the website to the best of our abillities (please note, however, we are not rich and as such will probably be begging favours for bandwidth :P)  and will consider adding the designer of the site to the list of members to this Blog... but please be aware, this is only a suggestion and you would have to go through rigorous training, not have an afro and also wear socks.
