Prety normal sister stuff but the amazing thing is shes only barely 3...What a SIS!!! The other component thats irreplaceable is my brother.Hes turning 2in like 4months but he is one tough dude,seriously im not the bully type but he sure is.He'll take anyone on.I dont know where he gets it but he'll stare my mom down and shout right bak.Although he doesnt say anything coherent but still.And god forbid you ever get in his face, he'll just stare at you and like hypnotize you with a little smile and you think hes gonna give you a hug or a kiss but BAM!!!!!!!!!!! outta no where he swings a blasting left handed punch to the side of your head! its not powerfull hit my no means but it comes fast and unexpected~! although hes done it, it doesnt go unpunished,he gets his ass yelled off by momsy..Even though he seems like a tyrant not in a million years would anyone not absolutly love him.Which I do! I'd do anything for the stinker. But one of the worset things about being the older brother whos loves them and does everything they ask for well, if EVER you get ticked or pissed off,and raise your voice at them,well then your gonna be the one in trouble.I had to tell my sis not to stick her fingers in the VCR like a year ago and I yelled cuz she wouldnt stop, so she turns to me and takes her hand outta the Tv and ran away crying..it was truely heart tearing.she wouldnt even look at me for days,until someone else made her cry:P:P i cant wait till i have my own kids:D
