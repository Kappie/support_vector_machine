Jeff then has this incredibly  urlLink pithy observation:   Well, the good news is that health care is a subject that damned well needs tackling. It's shameful what's happening in this country: millions uninsured; people trapped in the wrong jobs just because of health benefits; money wasted on exploding insurance bureaucracy; doctors' time wasted with insurance time-wasters; proper and necessary care withheld from the sick; costs skyrocketing; malpractice rates driving doctors away.... Oh, Lord, it needs tackling.   The bad news: If Moore does as blunt and bad a job of it as he did with war and politics in Fahrenheit and gun control in Columbine, it ratchets-up and dumbs-down the debate. What we don't need is more polemic and preaching to the converted and the sick. What we do need is intelligent, well-researched, strongly argued media that will set and change the agenda in both parties. Once upon a time, I might have thought that Moore could contribute to that debate. But that's my real problem after Fahrenheit: He merely seethes and it's too damned easy for the other side to ignore the slob seething in the corner.   He's absolutely right. MM has served a small purpose, that of stimulating debate. However, the approach and tone he takes is so off-putting to some that it just makes it easy to pass him off as another fanatic (which is precisely my approach). While MM's approach is powerful for the believers, it has the exact opposite effect for those he is trying to convert to his side. MM preaches to the choir and the missed facts, the arguments that try to have it both ways ("we shouldn't have attacked Afghanistan" vs. "we didn't send enough soldiers to Afghanistan") are things that get overlooked by the people who generally believe the same things as MM. However, if you disagree with MM all you see is a rabid fanatic who you shouldn't even bother trying to debate because all he'll do is just shout you down (halfhearted! Oil!), and froth and seethe some more.   What he chooses to attack isn't the problem - it's the methods. Some of what he has to say may in fact be valid, but it's the zealotry that makes it so unpalatable.   UPDATE:  Others are saying  urlLink basically the same thing .
