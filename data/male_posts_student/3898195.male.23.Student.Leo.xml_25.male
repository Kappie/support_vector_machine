The author don't seem to bullshit around and go straight to the point.  I felt like something is going in my body again... something inspiration is happening again! Coding is fun. I dropped coding for more than six years now, I'm sure there are many new things and it's going to be hard for me to pick up everything again... but I'm up to the challenge!
