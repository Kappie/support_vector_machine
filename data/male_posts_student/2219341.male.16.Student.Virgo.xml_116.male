Veronica, L, and i sat at a table and talked bout OCD!  aww man it was funny!  and then on the way back we pretended like we had OCD and we couldnt walk on the lines in the floor and if we did we had to go back!  oh man!  lol...we would some pretty stupid OCD people!  hehehe!  lets see...then after school there was a rehearsal for our Orlando trip/competition.  ha.  it was nice to have a decent guy section that could sing!  finally!  for once it didnt sound like i was singing by myself!  course im not really lookin forward to goin on the trip.  i dunno.  it doesnt sound like its gonna be that great....mainly cuz we have some musical theater "cliques" coming.  i know that sounds kinda negative...and yeah it probably is...most of the musical theater people are really nice...but there are a few that are really stuck up and think they're just sooooo cool.  it drives me nuts.  like i said...its only like a couple of them...not all of them.  but it bugs me...specially since some of them used to be my friends.  its so funny how quickly they forget you.  aww well.  it happens.  anyways...so im not really jumpin to go.  but hey might as well.  yes.  well.  im as confused as ever.  and im frustrated cuz im confused which is probably my fault which is probably what i deserve cuz im really stupid sometimes and half the time im a jerk and GRRRRRRRR!  ok.  yeah.  like i said im frustrated.  so im gonna go and do i dunno what...adieu...
