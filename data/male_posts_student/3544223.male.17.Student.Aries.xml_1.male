It is as though i am near my death date. Ever since i declare to step out of Atrina life, i have many doubt about lots of things. I some how regret patching up with her, even though that time when we patch back i told her that i would never regret but i can't pretend that i don't have any feeling about it at all. The feeling inside me was like very chaos. I don't know how to describe it. I only know that i can't help but think of her everytime but at the same time sort of had this feeling of wanting to tell her straight that i hate the thought of her treating me like a toy. It is like a ghost who can only come out at a certain time of the day, i am just like the ghost. A certain period of the year, she will come finding me like crazy like that then after that it will be like a cold war though out the year already. Just like a season like that. *sigh*. I don't know, i just hope to forget her as soon as i can. I myself know that it is hard to get ride of this feeling but i really have to get ride of this feeling and forget her totally before i can move on in life to do greater things. I am now hinded by her face, her feelings all these. I really don't understand what way i am no good to her?    Every where i go is just like a dead city to me. I am always like talking to ghost, walls, zombie, air whatever. I feel like i am getting away from girls and not the other way round. I some how don't trust what girls says. I rather don't believe in them or just don't feel like talking to them. What my friend told me was, " forget about her, she isn't worth the cost to be so madly deeply in love for her! You should go out to find a better girl, sure you can get somebody better than her ten times, twenty times." say is so easy but done is not. I have to face up with so many obstacles in front of her, while on another hand i have to make sure i do not bring my emotions into my study at all. *SIGH* I am very confused now, what i hope to do was to get out of the school and go into poly so that i won't get to see her forget in my life again. I hereby swear to god that i won't return after i have taken my result at all cost. No matter how she is going to plead me i won't go back to her anymore. I hope what i swear, i am not going to regret it my whole life.
