This is about 3 weeks earlier than last year, which is either a testament that the new online grading system saves heaps of time, or just means people weren't so darn slow this year grading exams.  But I had a hunch that if they were saying they'd be up tomorrow -- they didn't give a time -- they really meant today.  So I checked.  They're not up yet.  Oh well.  I can wait.  I can wait a while.  I know they don't matter.  But I'd be lying if I denied being curious anyway.
