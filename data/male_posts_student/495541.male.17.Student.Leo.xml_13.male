Today's song of the day is: Coldplay - "Don't Panic" from their 2000 release "Parachutes"  Excellent song.  It really sounds great but it's sort of short at only 2 minutes and 16 seconds.  If you get the album, you'll really like it, believe me.  Popular songs on the CD include "Shiver", "Yellow" and "Trouble."  Later.
