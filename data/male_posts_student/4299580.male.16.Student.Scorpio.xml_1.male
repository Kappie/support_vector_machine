(Most of them have blogs...didn't want to be left out :p) Hehe, Now...How shall I start this significant Post? Ah okay, i'll talk about today then.  Today, I had a CYA (Changi Youth Ambassador) meeting today. I didn't go, despite multiple notices. Why? Maybe because I was too lazy...or i was glued to my bed. Then wan (ridwan, my best friend) annoyed me by calling me up, and trying to persuade me to get my ass up n off my bed.  "Hey, you bitch! Go cya ah!"  "Why?!"  "Cos...I'm your Friend(kerpal). No lah! Cos if you dun go then i got no fren lah, just go lah bitch!"  "Dun wan lah, f*ck."  "Aiyah you idiot...ah okay bye."  "Ah."  Sigh, so with the rest of the day free I had to do something, so I called up Kelvin and decided to Go DOWNTOWN! lah lah lah lah lah.(sorry, coulndt help it :p)  We went to bugis, parco around there. Played at the arcade-Ate-Played LAN-Ate-Plated Arcade again-ATE...OMFG! Kelvin sure eats alot! Jesus! we ate 3 times in less than 6 hours! first was Yoshinoya...then Delifrance...then Chicken on a stick...then Thai Beefkwayteow.  So after our last meal, we took the train home...and we we're talking about bastard(ing) people, blah blah. Kelvin started doing moonwalks and we were chatting about dance moves, then the train came. We boarded..and much later the voice announced next stop kallang..  Shit, we took the wrong train! haahha we were so caught up in talking about dance moves we took the wrong train towards changi side!We laughed so hard at our mistake.  god dammit...  Next Episode  I will introduce the very first bastard plan on this guy named Jeffery! who is sec 1 this year in Ang mo kio sec! muhahaha stay tuned ppl.
