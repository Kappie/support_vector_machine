I never told my frens bout' this b4 as I noe they will probably laugh cus I haven been passing my Chinese for quite some time already. So paper 1 was normal, as for paper 2, I juz dun see myself failing. I dun think I can get an A2, I'm juz hoping to get at least a B4 rite now. Haha, but it's over at last! Finally...  I made my way home to rest and chill awhile b4 meeting my fren. We went to Jurong Entertainment Centre to play pool for bout' 2hrs. It was so relaxing man, finally no worries again. Haha, but I didn't haf much luck. It was still enjoyable though none the less.  We went to KFC for dinner den made our way down to this Cash Converter shop. My fren wanted to buy a joystick for his pilot game, so I juz accompanied him to explore the place. I spotted a BenQ 2.1 Megapixil Digital Camera, which looked totally brand new. It had no scratches at all and it was shining brightly. Furthermore, it cost onli $135! OMG! I haf to get tt man, it's so small, slim and compact too. I'll find the money to get tt sooner or later, hopefully sooner. Hehehe.  We went to Popular next, juz to waste some time b4 heading home. So it's like 12:00+am now and I'm still awake typing this entry. I haf no activities for tomorrow at the moment, hopefully I get to do something. Haha, anyway my injury seems to be getting betta day by day. So no worries anymore. Cya guys around! =]
