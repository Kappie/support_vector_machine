I mean, I've spent hours just sitting here, on a couch, at a lan (if you had read my previous posts you would know im at a lan). I mean, I have been amused about 10% of the day, which i've spent; walking to the quick-e-mart and back, playing Sven-coop with DilyX, watching naruto ep 90 (Which so totally owns btw). Also, today my mailing service fucked, www.portalen.no is currently fucked up, so I can't recive or send e-mails, which is quite fustrating concidering that i dont know if the e-mail i sent to my girlfriend ever *got* sent or not (again, there are just 3 other posts so far, just go read em..). Nor do I know if she has replied saying something in the lines of either "Fuck off shittard" or "miss you, love and kisses". I spent 7 minutes drawing today, 'cause i figure i should draw stuff atleast once a day. Today i drew a whale in OC, shaded in photoshop. By the way, about 4 of those 7 minutes where spent figuring out wtf i was going to draw..      oooh well.. let's hope something happens tomorrow..
