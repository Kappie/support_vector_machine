But the wind quickly erased whatever my heart composed. I suppose riding my bike again, I will run into those lost words, and I am sure they will be a little different than the ones that first came to mind.   At work, everything came together. The children worked hard on the projects my teaching partner and I assigned. We laughed and talked about so many things besides school. It felt like a small community even it was temporary.   In the evening, I hung out with an older revolutionary from the 60s and as always, it was an amazing night, talking politics and life with him. Besides getting drunk, he eventually sobered up and drove me around the city. We went through the ghettos of Detroit and Highland Park and saw prostitutes, pimps, little children riding their bikes at 1 in the morning. He showed me the memories of a city long ago hidden in abandoned crack houses and empty lots--the homes of famous revolutionaries from what seems to be so long ago. But I was quickly reminded that those people were not from ages ago, but a living reality as my friend had known many of them such as Ahmed Shawki, General Baker, and others who were involved in the revolutionary struggle in Detroit. It was a beautiful ride through the city. While much of it was asleep, there was still much restlessness. The wind as always carried scents of past struggles...  I had the weirdest dream this morning. I imagined that I traveled back in time to the first days that I met my love and lived those days again till the day we went our different ways. And then I went back in time and lived those days again and I kept doing that till I was very old. Eventually I met my love in the present and she asked where have you been and I told her that I was with her the whole time. The dream ended there... I do not know what it means, except that it left me with a feeling of sadness...
