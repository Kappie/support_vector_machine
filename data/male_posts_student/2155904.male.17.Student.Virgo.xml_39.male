It is one of those things where you just can't lose.  Unless you die.  Then you lose.  But anyway today was pretty cool.  After school Tyke and Skippy went to Teddy's and got like 750 candy canes for gingerbread houses tomorrow.  Then they went home.  Upon arrival of Tyke into his home his madre told him that he got a call from KING5 about his mentorship thingy.  To cut the long story down to make it short, he is doing it there.  So...cool.  But really the story of the day involves a very large man and a semi-large but really normal big sized man.  Anyway coming back to lunch today Tyke walked into the commons and Dean (BIG) and Sweeney (Macka) called Tyke over to talk to them.  BIG told him he should come to the Senior Trip meeting tonight but Tyke told him he was unavailable.  Then Macka started talking to him about another issue.  He said that Tyke should start going out with Tina.  Then he said that he should start to rub it in the face of Kram.  Then when Kram gets mad at Tyke, BIG and Macka would have a reason to kill Kram.  Thats right.  Not just beat up but kill.  So Tyke was like, ok sweet!  Then they saw Tina so the guys told Tyke to go talk to her so he was going to anyway so he did.  Then Kram walked by and just kinda walked right by sorta and then Tyke kept talking and then when Tyke left Kram came back over to Tina.  This was one of the greatest/funniest moments ever!  It was incredible.  Haha...so now Tyke has people on his side for him and Tina.  Now he only needs Tina.  Eh, damn that is the hard part.  LET THE OPERATION BEGIN!  Oh yeah and also today...Tyke went to his soccer party and he got some sick Superman outfit that is for little kids and he put on the shirt and it fits enough to be worn but it is insanely wickedly tight on him even.  So then he put his cape on and his headband and took some pictures of him flying.  Yeah, that is gonna be cool, Commander Cool.  Kinker, Macaroon, Tyronius.  Good names.  Haras, Purdy, Mandy, Dottie, Tina, Amed, Skippy, Dolores, etc.  Good names.  Go people!
