I'm normally up around 9:00 or so. So yeah it felt good. We went to Friendlies with my nana for lunch. She's home from the hospital and it's good to see her back. I had a cheeseburger and then chocolate ice cream with gummy bears. Man, I couldn't feel my stomach after that. I think I gained some weight, which is a good thing. I could use a few pounds here and there. I was on the computer for awhile when we got home then I went outside to the pool and trampoline. It wasn't a particulary exciting day but like I said, it's summer. The days will get more interesting when school starts. I'll probably also have a lot to talk about when we come back from Seaside next week. We're leaving this coming Monday and coming back Thursday. It's not as long as originally planned but we're planning on going to Hershey park in the fall. That will be fun. Oh hershey chocolate. My stomach is groaning at the thought. That's what 5 big scoops of chocolate ice cream right before you get on the computer will do to you.
