I am not smart, nor dumb. I am not nice, nor mean. I am not the best, nor the worst. I am not strong, nor weak. I am not happy, nor sad. I am not good, nor bad. I am not fun, nor boring. I am not fast, nor slow. I am not rich, nor poor. I am not the winner, nor the loser. I am not sweet, nor bitter. I am not old, nor young. I am not short, nor tall. I am not black, nor white. I am who my destiny has formed me into…   And really we are who we meant to be! Although what did happen to our will?
