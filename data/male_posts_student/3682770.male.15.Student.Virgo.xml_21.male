First, mom became nervous, she called the management office,  and of course, a tecnician. From her eyes, and her behaviours, i knew that she panic.  Sis gotta leave home early in the morning the next day, so she wondered whether she could bath or not. My father was calm at the very beginning, but then, as time goes by, he became unpatient as well.  All these did annoy me. I said loudly, "Just calm down," yeah, and it came under control.  In our life,  sometimes, we will panic. But bear in mind that you should calm thyself down. After that, everything's gonna be fine.  Now, the problem is solved, temporarily.
