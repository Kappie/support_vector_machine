( im guilty of this crime but nvm abt tt). i mean theres more to gym than just tramp rite.....n wld it actually hurt to try something new? ( ok dont answer this because i think its rhetorical). u see right....im alredi retired frm c div n b div tramp. so i come back and just fool arnd on the bars(which is more than what most of u can do so there)and my main comment is laughter! ok so it sucks....so laugh...but at least i did sth right? ( laugh summore)  c'mon maybe u realise tt gym isnt just 1 thing; its a sports which encompasses so many different things, brought together by the main heartstrings of beauty and inner strength. n tt's y gym development isnt being good enough in a compulsury to get a medal back; its abt reaching as far as u can go anywhere in each n every discipline. hmm i shld be going off nw. think abt it b4 u start laughing again, n ask me didnt i say just nw 'lame comments aside'. (if u really dont wanna listen to this or think its utter garbage, u cld at least treat it as a first update in....a week?)lol.
