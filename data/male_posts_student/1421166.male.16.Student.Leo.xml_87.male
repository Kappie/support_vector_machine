I just never dare to try out new things and never have any self-confidence. And what makes this even more real is that I do create fantasy worlds where I'm supernatural or something, which coincides with the description for this disorder. I didn't need a test to discover that. Oh well...but the test is quite true actually. For me at least. Maybe it's just coincidental. So far I'm the only person who isn't totally surprised by my results. But I am very shocked by some other people's results. I mean is scary to see someone get High or Very High for everything. Yes, it's not accurate, but if you look at it relatively, comparing to the results of others, it's really scary and terrible. Sigh...  It's morning now, definitely hope it'll be a productive day.
