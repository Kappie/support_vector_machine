Basically today for the whole afternoon I was at the library, surveying how many people use what at the library, and then cut stuff again.    Some good new for today though, I called Graham, the youth pastor at WLAC, and he seemed to like the idea of a coffeehouse between WLAC and LCAC. Him, Josh, and I are meeting tomorrow to discuss more into detail. Pray it goes well people =).    Then I came home, ate, SCed, and then now I go watch Conan O'Brien.    Bye.
