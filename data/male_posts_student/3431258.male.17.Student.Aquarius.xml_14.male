After playing a bit of Jumper (See  Interaction With A Jumper  for more informations), i checked the link to see directly where it came from. After few researchs on the owners website, i discovered http://www.neave.com/. I must say it's one of the most original website i have seen in ages. i also found some cool stuff on it. He as a game section were you can play them on the site, download them to windows or Mac, or even apply the flash code to your website! To name a few : Pacman, Asteroids, Tetris, Simon Says, hexxagon and snake. They are hand coded by him and are of great quality. Try them!   Neave game section  (All Free)  http://www.neave.com/games  I think i will sleep a bit more, my mom waked me up to open the computer so she can access the internet.I still can't wait for July, it's gonna be such a great month!  Regards,  Zephyr
