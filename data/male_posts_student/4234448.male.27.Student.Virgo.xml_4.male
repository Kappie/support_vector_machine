With words, I will profess my love of Blogocracy and Bloggers everywhere.  In this hollowed ground, I dedicate myself to the oath of Blogdom: "I, Rebel Clearwater, promise to blog in the anarchist spirit of resistance to the Great White King and tender care toward fellow bloggers."  All those who cherish freedom join with me in creating the heaven of Blogdom here on earth!
