He asked if i'd ever felt like i really wanted to be an actor, and then we discussed it on and off, i REALLY wanted to discuss it but yeah. Sigh. I don't know what i want to do right now... would it hurt for me to take a year off uni and try acting scool? I'd probaby go to  urlLink  the ensemble theatre's school  because they teach based on the method, from what i've heard. I think that wouold be best for me, a nice developed system. It seems interesting, and -woah - my drama teacher went there (Mr O'brien if you're wondering) hmm... I'll think about it. I don't see how it would hurt to take a year off. *ponders*
