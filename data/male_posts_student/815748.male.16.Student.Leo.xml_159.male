We placed twelfth, which is the best any Massachusetts team has done since 1990 - and that time it was Newton North too.  Stephanie was right; this was an awesome experience.  I can't think of much to say that doesn't sound formulaic, not that what I've already said hasn't been so.  I have so much to do; luckily I have a week to do the big Liberia essay, and who knows how long to do the commentaries.  I thought I was going to get so much done, and I didn't do any work.  Even so, I don't regret it.  I also wrote another short story, mostly while on the plane (and you can tell).  I don't know whether to post it.  Tell me if you think I should.  South Carolina's opening statement began with "All roads lead to Rome," and they went on to say that all roads led to the defendant, for she was the murderer.  During that, Josh, one of our lawyer-coaches and technically the state coordinator, wrote that additionally, Rome wasn't built in a day- but the prosecution's case was.  Later on, at the banquet, Ben Hodes said, "All roads lead to my ass."  Josh also told this really funny joke while we were at Disney's Typhoon Lagoon (where we had to remain fully-clothed for some reason).  I'll tell it if you want; it has to be spoken out loud.  At Typhoon Lagoon, part of the group - including Gaby - were separated from the rest when we were going to leave.  Elliott was wondering where they were, and Ben said, "Gaby is probably on her knees right now."  Elliott scowled at him, and he added, "... praying  that she'll find us in time!"
