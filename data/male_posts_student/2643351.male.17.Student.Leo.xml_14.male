You must be the real reason for global warming.”  “Is there an airport nearby or is that just my heart taking off?”  “If I could rearrange the alphabet, I’d put U and I together.”   "Did it hurt...when you fell to Earth from Heaven?"   Do your feet hurt,... cus you have been running through my mind all day
