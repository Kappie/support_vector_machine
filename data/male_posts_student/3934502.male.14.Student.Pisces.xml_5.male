I managed to pass up my project on Graphs to Miss Peh on time (7:25 am as promised) this morning, though I was working late into the night the day before - I think I was still doing it at around 1 am? Anyway, my class (entire Sec 2 level in fact)had our Chinese Oral Test today, and I most probably failed, since my command of the Chinese language is ba-a-ad. I couldn't even speak a single fluent sentence! Think about it, three components and I didn't even have a single good point for any of them. I guess I got pretty stressed out in the classroom while waiting for my turn... Ah well, so much school, and so little time... Oh yeah, forgot to do my homework again... Cya!
