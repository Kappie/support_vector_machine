We listened to this old guy who was a monk for 30 years talk about Buddha's teachings. It was really interesting -- he said that all other religions require you to pray to a god, and he said that Buddhism isn't a religion, it's a way of life. You treat your mind as a god, I suppose. He went on to say how Buddhism is peace orientated, and because there is no "truth" (like in Islam and Christianity), there is no fighting about which is more right (like Islam and Christianity).  Anyway, I think it's got a lot more going for it than Christianity.
