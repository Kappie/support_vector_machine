A Game of Thrones was an interesting and very entertaining read. I've become hooked on Martin's form of writing and the story he has created. It is amazing; the good guys do not always win, there is much violence, and it is an epic.  It was crazy what happened to Eddard Stark, I knew it was going to come because of Martin's reputation but it was still surprising, he was an extremely important character. I also like Jon quite a bit. I have a feeling that he is actually the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna and will somehow hook up with Dany to rule the world. :p  More to come later....
