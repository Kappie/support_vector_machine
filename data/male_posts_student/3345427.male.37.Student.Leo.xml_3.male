We’ve been together for 24 years and have never cheated on each other until last night. Should I tell him? ***********************************************************************  2) I’m 22 years old and in my 4th year of college at Alabama State University. I think I’m gay. How do I know and what should I do? I’m totally in the closet and my father, the pastor of the biggest Southern Baptist congregation is Alabama will probably disown me. Please help!   ************************************************************************  Dear Cheater...  I wonder why you went to that bar in the first place. Were you out for libations, or were you out to feed your sexual appetite as well. You say you have a Lover of 24 years, I gather that your frequency of sex may have fallen to an all time low, as it seems for some couples that sex does wane when the years mount up. Did you mean for this sex act to go on, or did it take you by surprise. I think that you wanted to cheat, and the excitement of getting caught was just the right fuel you needed to take that step over that imaginary line, I like to call "CHEATING!"  You know that you should not be in a relationship, if you have to go outside of the one you are in to satisfy something that your partner cannot give you. If your partner finds out will he A) kick you to the curb or B) forgive and forget, and will you ever tell him to begin with, or will you add this secret to the many that you keep locked away in your "secret" diary??? OHHH, bad little boy.  If you cheated here, how many times have you cheated already and did not "Get Honest" with the man you should have had sex with. I hope this does not become habitual. Be careful the decisions you make, they not only affect you, but may fuck someone else up for life. If you make the decisions about screwing around, then please release your partner of the guilt he will carry thinking that it was his fault that YOU decided to cheat on him.  Cheers Mary Advisalot  *********************************************************************  Dear Alabama Virgin,  They say that when we enter University that the goal of the instiutution we are in is to change the way we think and feel by the time we leave. I see that that is true for you. 22 And not know what to do..Ahhh decisions, decisions.  Daddy is Pastor of a Baptist church you say, well, I think you need to find your way into the world. I like to say that There is NO MAN on EARTH who has God's Ear... so if you listen to man, you will always be disappointed. Listen to your heart and follow what it tells you. In my belief system God Loves me for who I am, not for what I am not. Therefore my young man, take your time, talk to as many people as you can.  The more knowledge of the world you wish to enter, the better off you will be in the long run. Labels do more harm in separating humans than they do to unite them. I suspect that your first step in coming out is find someone you can trust to talk to, find a place you can live and be yourself. Young Man, Coming out IS a LIFELONG process, which is not to be taken lightly. It is not just a one day " throw open the Doors and SAY "HEY WORLD I AM GAY," kind of event. This will begin to shape every part of your being, and mold you into the man you will become. Take your time. Trust only those you MUST and love those you can, while you still have time.  People in our lives exists with us on a need to know basis, and Does DADDY need to know everything? no he doesn't. Gossip kills, so does homophobia. Be careful what you let loose into the public forum, because the implications of success will be determined by the support you have. Coming out is a big step, and the loss of family and friends, allbeit, for a little while, is a very high probability, that is why i suggest you find people to stand in your corner as the news gets disseminated. AND on YOUR terms as well. Not theirs...  Church folk are strong in their convictions, but you should stand up and be the man you were meant to be. I would be saddened to read years from now that you are divorced and have young children, and the reason you left your marriage was because you realized that you were really GAY to begin with.  Wasted time is Wasted time my young friend. Time is a precious commodity, once wasted it can never be regained. So young soldier, what are you going to do with your time now???  sincerely  Mary advisalot.  My name is Jeremy I am 36 and live in Montreal. I spend most of my nights here in front of this little box, doing this - what you read above. I spend my days in classes at Concordia University Majoring in Religion and Minoring in Interdisciplinary Studies in Sexuality. I've been a member here since September 2003. My words and posts speak for themselves. Some more bio-info. I have been HIV + for now going on 12 years, and I am still alive. One of the few POZ members on this board. I am ( 2 1/2 years, clean and sober) and i volunteer my time at a drug crisis center here in Montreal. Not to mention the hours I spend at my computer at night talking to the masses around the world every night. I am involved in a relationship that has had it's ups and downs, and I've been to hell and back, several times. The best thing us "elders" can do is share a little insight with others. Getting the message out and helping another person is what we should do every day. It's all about sharing pearls of wisdom. If we don't all of our secrets will die in the grave we will eventually lay in.
