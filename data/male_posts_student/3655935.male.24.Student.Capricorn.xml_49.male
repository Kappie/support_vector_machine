It should be quick to load, not using a lot of graphics.  Notice that there isn't an ad at the top of the page as well?  Pretty nifty...  I decided to remove the "Click here to read more" option.  It was nice, but it was more annoying to see it when I there wasn't more to read.  I'll try to be a good blogger and keep my posts short.  Bear with me as I work all the bugs out of this...  Let me know what you think of the changes!
