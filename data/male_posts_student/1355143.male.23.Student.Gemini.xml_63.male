Does "og" mean "and?" The Chinese cities truly are impressive though, aren't they? Skyscrapers like none other, and I live in the birthplace of the skyscraper. Do people take you for an American often? Have you found yourself a nice Chinese girl to settle down with and have card-carrying, chopstick-toting babies? I, too, was pleased to see Barca's success. Saw a kid in a Barca jersey the other day, and I started humming the song of the Gent del Barca. And you'll have to ask Ulli about the Owen-Kluivert deal. I'm sure he's found a website that tracks the daily activities and phone conversations of all of Chelsea's foes, Premiership or otherwise. Glad to have your input to the blog, Vegard. This blog gets to seem like a bit of a threesome at times, and when I think threesome I don't think Adam and Ulli.   Cheers, Tim
