When I walk naked, I can't feel the cold.  The best part about it is the other people.  The thing is, you can see  them  naked too.  But you have to look them in the eye.  It's hard doing what I do.  I do it every Friday from 7:15 to 7:30.  I can only do it on the east side, where it's quiet.  I walk real slow--real cool, like I know something that no one else knows.  And I'm beautiful, and dangerous.  It's easy to snap out of it too.  You can't smile, you can't think about anything.  You have to feel yourself, watch yourself.  Think about that.  No one else can see you naked, unless they're naked too.  My eyes are halfway filled with tears.  That's what happens when you walk around town naked.  When you feel yourself, you want to cry.  You can see the tears welling in everyone else's eyes too.  I don't do it 'cause I want to, I do it 'cause I have to.  It's like looking at your eyes in the mirror, and suddenly becoming so aware of yourself that you get scared.  Don't be scared, the bridge is creaking under your weight, but you haven't fallen.  Appearances are transparent; you are beautiful, and dangerous too."  That literally poured out of my brain and onto paper on a train ride home tonight, I think it is really good.
