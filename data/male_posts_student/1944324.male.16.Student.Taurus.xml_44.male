You know what Marten and I meant...and I thought your story about your loveseat was quite entertaining.  lol just kidding...but it reminds me of a little couch I had when I was younger...it was blue and you could pull off the seat and it was a toy box!!! it was the coolest thing ever!!!  I loved it!  My dad bought it for me...but the fact that my butt got too big for it, plus the fact that I didn't play with toys anymore caused me to sell it.  Memories.    Anyways, back to whatever.  I just want to read interesting stuff...not stuff about these girls you like who I don't even know.  You know?  I mean...I could write about all the guys I flirt with in a day...and you wouldn't know half of them.  So would you really want to read that?  I didn't think so.  So...there.  lol see you tomorrow! SQUEE!
