It is true that, "vengance is a plate better served cold", i loved the revenge theme the movie had, and the way she is gettin her revenge. I dont know why i didnt see this movie before, i cant wait until aug 10 and rent Kill Bill Vol 2. I greatly admire Quentin Tarantino's taste and style of making movies. He has such a great vision on his project and he know what poeple want to see, well at least he knows what i want to see and how i want to see it. Ill never hesitate to see a Quentin Tarantino film ever again.
