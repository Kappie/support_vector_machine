She was awesome, but the stress of our store got to her. I liked my job before this asswipe of a manager started working there.  Last night Katrina, Josh, Katie, Mike, Tony, and I had all sorts of bad things to say about the new manager. We basically all wanted to beat the guy up.   Anyway, Katrina, Jan, Josh, Amy and I went to Taco Loco last night and then wandered around Laguna. We checked out the various galleries, snagged some free wine, and the museum.  After that, Josh and I met up with Andy in Irvine. Then we we hung out with Ryan, Helen and Margaret.  Lots of names huh? Yea, yesterday was a long and busy day.  I've got to go work with that fucker of a manager in a few minutes.  **
