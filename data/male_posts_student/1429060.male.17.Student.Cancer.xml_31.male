I really think that I may have some chemical imbalance, because this feeling of general worthlessness occurs far too often for my liking. No, I wouldn't say worthlessness. Just...nonexistence almost. Like nothing means anything. Well, perhaps, a bit of worthlessness; I've been feeling lately that I really am of no value to anyone. What are my purposes? Learn language and play music. Like that ever helped anyone. Shit. Maybe I am just crazy.  I feel like screaming. But I can't. Nowhere to scream.  Perhaps I take things far too seriously. I don't know, a friend of mine was angered at me today - pretending, I know, she was simply imitating anger. But maybe I unconsciously took it as a reality. Or maybe it is just watching those sad type movies, like Lord of the Rings (I know...initially, what is it but a bunch of fat hobbits? But the concept is rather upsetting if you truly grasp it). Perhaps that rubs off.  What in hell is wrong with me? I don't think I have mood shifts. A whole bunch of depression lately has been crowding in. I need to talk to someone.  I can't sleep now because of too many dreams. Remember that late post about no dreams at all? I wake up dead-tired because my brain has been dreaming all night. So maybe I am just tired. Or stressed. No, scratch that, I haven't had any work this week at the educational prison.  Bah. Human nature sucks.
