I saw  Hellboy . It's not out in England for another month. Nyah. It wasn't great. It didn't take itself too seriously though, which was nice. Anyway, upon arrival in Antananarivo (known as Tana, to keep it short) after a fairly boring stopover in Johannesburg, we were met by our guide, Lalayna (phonetically), a sober young man with excellent English. After changing our money and fighting off hoards of porters, we were driven by our driver Lala (no, really) to some place about 50 km away. Observations:       Many people are on foot.     Everyone is making bricks.     There are paddyfields everywhere.     The drivers are maniacs.    It reminds me most of what I've seen of Brazil on Geography case studies mixed with China.      After sleeping in a nondescript hotel, we drove to Ranomafana (Rano = Water, Mafana = Hot) the next day. It is a rainforest. There are hot springs nearby. It rained a lot. Constantly, in fact. We went around the forest three times. We saw:     Lemurs.     Chameleons.     Leaf geckos - They look  exactly  like bark on trees.     Moss.     Trees.     Bamboo.     Rain.      Then we went somewhere else, I don't remember where, then to Isalo. It's a national park filled with weird sandstone shapes, carved by the wind. Neat. We walked around there for a day, then we went to the seaside, near the Spiny Forest. It is a forest, in which everything is spiny. Someone showed us the uses for all the trees and plants. Then we flew to Tana, looked in one of their tiny museums, and then flew to an amazingly posh hotel. Imagine those ones in the movies of brilliant Caribbean resorts, but even better. The waiters hung around, refilling your glasses, which was annoying. They did have some good books there, though. I recommend  urlLink Tom Holt , and I disrecommend  urlLink Janny Wurts .   They had a variety of nice things to do. I failed miserably at waterskiing, saw fossilised lemur skulls, and went swimming a lot.    Er... then to another rainforest (getting a bit boring by now), and home. Saw  Shaun of the Dead . Pretty good.    Please note this is by no means complete. There are huge chunks missing, and I'll elaborate on any aspect that you like upon request.
