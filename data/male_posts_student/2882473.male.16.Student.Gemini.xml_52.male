Even though I had seen a small section of it before, I still decided to stay up past 01:00 with school the next day (or the same day, if you want to be clever). If anyone doesn't know, it features a group of kids from Japan (yes, it had to be a Japanese film didn't it? Only they could make such a sick film) who have been put on a deserted island and have to kill each other by any and all means neccessary. Each is given a random weapon, and if more than one person lives at the end, they all die. And each person is wearing a neck collar that explodes if the disobey. And it was in Japanese, with sub-titles. Very graphic. Lots of blood.  Had sports day today, they made me enter for the 200m sprint and the 100m relay race. Managed to come an ok 5th out of 8 in the 200m and our team of 4 came 7th in the relay. Sports day was very dull, but hey, we missed an English lesson. And a games lesson, but we were doing sports anyway... But as I haven't properly sprinted for about a year (last sports day in fact, where I did the same races) I am very unfit, and my legs will probably be aching for a week, well, they did last year anyway. I hate sports.
