(more on her later)  Ropes Course training was a blast.   i jumped off a 30 foot tall telephone pole.  Yeah.  I'm a bad ass.   Anyway, the team here is great.  Training is hard, but I'm so glad to be here.  Why I was considering doing something else?  I have no clue. So it's probably blatently obvious that I miss Elenie so much that it hurts.  I went from spending nine months straight with my best friend in the whole world to nothing at all.  Sad.  I miss her.  More later..... time for church
