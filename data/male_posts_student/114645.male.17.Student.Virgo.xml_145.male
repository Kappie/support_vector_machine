I told Stefani I was gonna do the questions for History and I never did. She got hella pissed off at me. Then I had to carry at least 90+ pounds home with all of my notebooks.   My final in Physics will be difficult, but easy, since we can use our study guides. French is worth 380 points, which is a lot. Keep in mind that each question is worth 4 - 6 points.  But yea. I better go study, so I will write more tonight, before I go to bed.
