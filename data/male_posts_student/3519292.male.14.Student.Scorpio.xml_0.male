You thing anyone cares what I think?HELL NO!Anyway,I'm at the store looking at video games and cd's and shit like that.Then some lady start's bitching at ME because I didn't stop HER SON from doing something. She's like"WHY DIDNT YOU STOP MY SON FROM THROWING THIS??????HE IS A VERY TROUBLED YOUNG BOY!!!!!HE MISBEHAVES ALL THE TIME AND HIS DAD DOSEN'T PAY CHILD SUPPORT!!!!" When she stops bitching I say"He's not my problem so i'm not worrying about it.If you were a good mom you would take care of him and not bitch to other people about your problems.So stop complaining and shut the hell up." She goes away then 3 minutes later,wal mart people tell me to leave the store and I say no.So they go away.Nearly got banned all because of her and her damn kid.  The lesson:Shut the hell up and don't complain.
