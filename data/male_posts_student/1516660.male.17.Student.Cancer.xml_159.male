And I can change the date of posting. Oh...cool features!   Ahh...yes. Coming to today's events. I woke up at 8.30 in the morning and took a bath. After the 20-minute bath (oh! improvement....or not?), I went online while waiting for Mom to buy breakfast (fried carrot cake. I ate that 2 days in a row!). While online, someone went online. Why I want to tell you leh? Everyone comes online. But ehh....this person is KWQ, who had blocked and deleted me from his contact list. Why did he add me back on again? Now I am utterly confused. Does he want to talk or what? Why, oh why, did he add me back? I was doing fine you know....until he came online and threw me into utter confusion. I don't know whether this is good, or bad. There are some good (obviously.....), but there are some bad too. Er. I am "one confused cat".  Okay, after breakfast, I watched cartoons. So many cartoons on Saturday! After cartoon-watching I went to cut my hair. Oh! I was so hoping for a nice barber. Nice defines into "not rough, not crude and not insulting". I have enough of barbers saying something about my height! The boss ar, recongized my mother and me! BUT! BUT! He thinks I am the youngest and asked where "my older brother" is! And Mom didn't straighten that misbelief! The barber I had was okay, but he was very meticulous. Very zi xi...go through every detail. And the way he uses the cutting thingy, like so scared like that. I think he's a newbie la. But it was boring watching him being so careful. HaHa!   After that, I came home, washed my hair twice (it's been a habit to shampoo my hair twice after a haircut....yeah!) and ate lunch. After eating lunch, I went for Wendy's house to study for Sci Prac and tuiton her. But first, we are meeting in Popular to buy our CD-R to burn songs.   I went out at 1.30 and took 913 to Admiralty Station. Met Wendy in Popular where we brought the 10 CDs. My mother lent me her Popular card to use, so we got 10% discount ($1). We used that $1 to buy two ice-cream cones from Macdonalds. We then walked back to Wendy's house.   We completed our studies for Science practicals. Well, actually, I did. Wendy seems quite unsure of her work, so I am teaching her tomorrow. After that, we are burning our CDs. YaY! Can finally have more CDs to listen to, instead of listening to Jay all the time. No no...not saying that Jay is lousy...but it does get boring after a while. Okay, after studying, we spent time reading books. She read her Condor Heroes book while I read the Teen Witch book. Then, we went out to watch her eldest brother play FFIX. He tuaght me a few tricks....ahh! Must remember ar!  We went down to buy food and drinks back for her brother. She wanted to get the Sour Cream and Onion Pringles, but I don't want. She insisted, and I let her buy. Hey! It's her brother's money after all! We then brought Roller-Coasters, some chips and Vanilla Coke.   Back there, I ate the Pringles. Can you believe it? I tred into "forbidden" terriotry! It's not so bad after all! I almost ate half of the chips there! I watched her brother level up his characters (he's trying so hard to find the turtle monsters to level up - we call it "wu gui wang ba"! HAHA!). Wendy called WanXin because WX smsed her. No no...cannot disclose what they are talking about. Privacy rights being invoked here! But I do realised that Wendy really makes a good psychologist! So expert in this kind of stuff...giving advice ar and all that. Woah! Her advices were practical and straightforward, and it is the best policy for everyone. Right Wendy? HaHa!  After her call, Wendy wanted to Chocobo Race with me! HaHa! You can say that this master lost every race to his student! She used the Bahamut wor! So expert sia! White Mage is naturally slow against Bahamut, but hey! At least I come in 2nd/3rd! Once, i used Bahamut, but I still lost! Sigh! But never mind lor! See the student I taught! So good at her games! This means that the teacher is REALLY SOMETHING to begin with! A-ha! Good teacher naturally produces good students ma! HaHaHa! So, no losses for me la! I am proud of my student ar!   Okay, after that came back, bathed and ate dinner while watching Simpsons. Then, came online and gave Wendy my mp3s that I wanted to burn tomorrow. Wendy recieved her present from her angel also ar! Her angel really creative, creating another email add to send her a poem. That's cool! She thought it was me, becuase the poem sound like me. HaHa! I find that hor, everytime she reads a poem. she thinks it's my work. I think she read too much of my work! HaHa! She says she's decorating the poem and printing it out (okay, I print for her).   Okay, I think i am ending this le. See ya tomorrow! Goodnight blog!
