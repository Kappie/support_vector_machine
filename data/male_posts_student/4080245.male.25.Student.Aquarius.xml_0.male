There were five of us to move - Mary, Marnie, Sabrina, Darcy and I, so it went very quickly, all in one and a half trips.  One and a half trips because the first time there were two truck loads and the second trip there was only one load in my truck and it was a light load at that.  The part that really sucked was moving into the apartment through a few doors and up the elevator.  Reminds me of all the other times I've helped people to move.  One of these days I'm going to call in those favours.  Props to Mary for buying a great lunch at Calhoun's and props to the counter girl who gave me a veggie sandwich and then a free one when I asked "Where's the meat?".  Two paninis and thai noodle salad with an ice tea on the side hit the spot.  I finally got rid of the ancient exercise bike that had been sitting in the back of my truck forever today although all I did was dump it behind Mary's garage in the hopes that somebody will take it, but I doubt they will.  I may have to make another trip to pick it up but I hope not.  I almost inherited an old dresser and rad leather chair in good shape but I figured I really don't want to move it in a few weeks.  As it is I have a set of snow tires for a golf in the back now.  Anybody need winter tires for their golf - cheap?  Their BF Goodrich's...  Had a great idea last night for a comedy movie - Will Farrell as America's first male aerobics instructor.  I think it has potential.  Hopefully now that I've written it here no one will steal my idea.  Got to head out now and mow the lawn, a.k.a. "pay the rent".  Stay classy...  p.s. one of these days I'll figure out how to add pictures
