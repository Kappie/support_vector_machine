Have of the shit on that test I don't even remember our teacher going over it! I felt sick when I saw that test and now God forbid if I fail, I might have to go into remedial math. In other words, I'll be in "stupid math". My theology final went well considering Mr. Barbier made all the questions easy to answer. At least I have today off. I'm going to the Yankee game tonight and maybe I just might bring back some pics to show you guys. I'm out for now.
