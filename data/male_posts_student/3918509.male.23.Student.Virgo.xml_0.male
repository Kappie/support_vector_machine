Evidently, the tomb held an inscription that matches Luke 2:25.  The inscription reads "Simeon who was a very just man and a very devoted old (person) and waiting for the consolation of the people."     The AP report mentions that the tomb may also belong to Zachariah, the father of John the Baptiser.  Very cool.
