So if  anyone  can let me stay at their house for 10 days, i would be  much obliged . Anyway, our pool is coming along quite well. They are filling it up with water, and i can't wait to just jump in. I've been working everyday this week to earn enough money to buy tickets. My brother Ian is going to take me to the concerts, if i find a place to stay, so i have to buy him tickets too. And pay for gas money....damn...that doesn't sound very good on my part. Oh well. I just got my crappy dial-up internet turned back on at my mom's house. It is by far the slowest of the slow. I'm connected at like 1 kbps right now. We can't get anything else out here in the boon-docks. Anyway....I'm going on a diet everybody. And i'm burning 1700 calories a day. I've been on it for 2 days now. I've replaced 2 meals a day with cereal. So i only get about 500-600 calories a day. Which isn't healthy, i think. But hey, the weight should leave fast. Welp, i'm gonna go. Farewell everyone.
