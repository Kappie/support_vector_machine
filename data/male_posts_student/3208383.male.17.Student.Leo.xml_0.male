People always say"if only i hadn't this hadn't that" there is no point doing so now.. Damn it.. JUST DO GO AND CHANGE WHATEVER YOU CAN CHANGE NOW!!! GO REVERT THE SITUATION LAH!!! Thats what I thought lah.. But now i realise that doing so i damn difficult. He doesnt even wanna tok to m.. what can i do.. I was blaming Farzana at first lah.. but after some thought i realised it's all my fault damn it.. Know that she is feeling bad la.. but dunno whether can tell her that.. :( hope that he can forgive me. dont think there's a chance for that. gonna go talk to him asap.. but can i stand the feeling of getting hurt if he reacts in he manner i expect him to.. :( haiz.. Life.. Gootta do so.. though both of us were like so close for only 7 mths, i felt like i'e known him for the whole of my life.. really treasure this friendship.. but he says it;s over.. how to revert the situation? Hmmm.. I really dun know.. First time i cried because of friendship that day.. Damn remorseful.. if only i hadnt came out with a lame excuse.. if only i had told him the truth.. if only... too many if only to say.. too many.. yet wat will happen in the future.. he isnt gonna bother abt me.. I'm like closer to him than to anybody lor.. even my parents.. I am NOT BLAMING ANYONE FOR THIS.. just me.. can anyone tell me what can i do.. have seen him angry before.. took him like dunno how many months did he take to forgive the people who incured his wrath.. will it happen to me? or will it take longer???? Hope he noes that i really treasure this friendship.. Gonna find a way to apologise soon.. oh one more thing.. know she is going to read the messages..  MJC concert on monday: was not very good..
