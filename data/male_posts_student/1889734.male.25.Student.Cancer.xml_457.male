I haven't decided exactly what I'm going to do, but one option was graduate school here at Western Michigan.  I don't know if that is the way to go, but I began researching it recently.  Well, I found out last night that they have a Masters of Fine Arts for Creative Writing, which is exactly what I want to do.  It looks like a good program, meeting my needs.  Unfortunately, they accept applications only once per year, and the due date was 2/1/04.  D'OH!  But what is even more amusing is the 'gatekeeper' for the Grad program.  She has great power in deciding who gets in and who does not.  To borrow a phrase from Mike, she is 'Sauron' here at WMU.  I must appease her.  Well, in reading her bio, I discover that she is a PhD in feminist and ethnic literature.    Hah!  I'm going to sit across from her and tell her that this white boy wants to occupy a slot in her program to write science fiction and fantasy?    So I think my chances are effectively doomed.  DOOOOOOOOMED.
