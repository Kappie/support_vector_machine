Oh, although, I have to say, before yesterday I was going to commend my commenters for not just resorting to having a conversation on my comments system. Well, you ruined that, didn't you, ye big feckers? I ask you.  Quote of the day: "If you fall, I'll catch, If you love, I'll love, And so it goes, my dear, Don't be scared, you'll be safe, This I swear. If you only love me back."  From Sonata Arctica's   The Misery   Love, Jon Roskilly
