Yes. so brighton wouldnt tell me why she was mad, while remiaining mad. shes saying now tho..what is she syaing....  hmm. -censor- was right. but i shouldnt write why here. itd be mean. This is sad tho. My first night is spoiled by that. By that flower being ripped. AHH i dont know why that one image depresses me so much. But it does. And i cant get it out of my mind. But at least aria wasnt mad at me. She got a mr wonderful doll from lindsey(it was so sweet) cause her bf broke up with her after 3 months ....it was partially my fault :P   but the doll said things like 'how was ur day at work? want me to rub your feet? and 'the football team is not important to me. I want you to have nice shoes." lol..it was really nice of lindsey.  And yanna gave me chocolate. i felt bad i ahd nothing for her. im getting her something in january. im workng out 'issues' with brighton..lol  i didnt go to kimberly's. shes sick!  degrassi was good. craig got screwed, the bad way, in the end. i love manny, even if she is a slut. tobey's family is jewish. this is the first show ive ever seen where there are more muslims than jews. It's good. Instead of just ignoring the existence of Islam like every other channel does. :P  I liek this thing. I mena, i know its detrimental caus eim posting thoughtsabout people for them to see, but its like talking to a friend. lol. yes. Its fun.  anyways  Much Love!  peace  ~alex, the unloved, hated, and by one, loved
