It is under maintenance right now so I guess I wanted to make an online journal I really have no idea what I am going to write in here and what to do now but I will have to get some pictures and such of what I am doing on Gaia.  Well other news not having to do with Gaia or anything on the internet, I have three books to read before next Wednesday and I am on page 12 of one of them. I should have planned things out a little better for the summer but whatever I enjoyed myself.
