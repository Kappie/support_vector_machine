I do agree with the author’s views to a certain extent but nonetheless feel that this is an insightful analysis on the current world situation.  	 I agree with his view that the US has to reduce its “missionary enthusiasm to shape the world in its own image.” Governments around the world have adopted democracy to varying degrees, from Iran to Switzerland, and the concept of democracy varies from country to country. In this sense, democracy is contextualized and that there is no one universal model being adopted. I believe that the context, in which democratic models of government are being formed, is culture. 	 The Asian subservience of Singapore calls for a different model of democracy, than say, a relatively liberal society such as the US. In this respect, I believe that a policy of cultural relativism has to be adopted, modifying what’s deemed as “pure” democracy and applying it to varying extents to better serve a particular culture, rather than changing a particular culture to fit into a supposed “exemplary” model of democracy.  Thus, I believe that unilateralism in the political re-construction of Iraq would be particularly ineffective. It would be much better if different countries take part in its political re-construction where many models and interpretations of democracy is being put on the table and is discussed extensively. Only through such dialogue and planning would a democratic model which better serves the Iraqi people and its culture be formed. Only if the association between democracy and the Stars and Striped is diminished, will the Iraqi people view democracy not as a form of political or cultural imperialism, but simply, a socio-political system worth considering and adopting.	   However, I do not agree with the author’s view that democracy in the context of elections would obstruct the fight against terror and on foreign policy as well as the view that these issues should be best left to the “experts”. Such a view, I believe, would prove especially dangerous in terror hot-spots such as Indonesia or Saudi Arabia. The mandate of the people in these places would be essential to combat terror as terror organizations prey on the dissatisfaction, poverty and ethnocentrisms of the people in these places. 	 Through rhetoric, even if few people join the ranks and file of these organizations, ordinary citizens would most probably turn into terrorist sympathizers. And for the terror groups, half the battle is already won. By trying Abu Bakar Bashir would simply mean dismantling the mechanism for terror but it would do little to weaken the will of the JI. I believe that Governments have to tackle the problem of terror ground-up, and democracy meaning “power to the people”, is especially essential. Terrorism has to be fought on the grassroots and the governmental level, if the battle is not yet won on the ideological front, the war against terror is far from over. 	 In conclusion, I believe that democracy should be tailored for the people, and not the people tailored for democracy. How the war against terror is won, or lost, hinges on how democracy is adopted and implemented.
