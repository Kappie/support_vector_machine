Let me quote the email: "The Projects (aka Zespy's) 17th  Jackson by the self storage units and Shakespearience Audio)."  Translation:  inside the self-storage units.  Cutting to the chase, the bands involved this evening were:   Pash , a one-girl band from Portland, OR (originally Minneapolis).  The Dirty Projectors , a one-boy band from Portland, OR.  Anna Oxygen , a one-girl band from Olympia, WA.  [[[VVRRSSNN]]] , pronounced "version", a one-boy band from Portland, OR.  The Blow , a one-girl band from either Fargo, ND, or Portland, OR.  +5 scene points to the first person to guess  urlLink which record label  most of these people are on.  Okay actually only two of them are, but they all may as well be.  Despite a marathon set lasting from 9 PM to nearly 2 AM, I think I can dub the show a reasonably good time.  Pash was up first.  Stylistically she had a lot in common with The Blow, in that she generally performed a capella or with simple backing tracks.  When she came on, she had the audience (I almost said "class" for reasons you will discover immediately) lie down on the floor as she attempted to evoke the mood of naptime in preschool for the purpose of one of her songs.  I can understand where she's coming from, I guess, but the floor was cold concrete and pretty uncomfortable.  She did succeed in making me remember a lot about kindergarten, though, principally how much I hated being forced to do the Hokey Pokey.  As a child, I regarded Mrs. McGrath's fascistic insistence that all of her young charges do the Hokey Pokey, and other related activities, to be immensely humiliating.  I hate the Hokey Pokey and I am entirely convinced that being forced to do it and subsequently being held up for ridicule when I did it wrong scarred me for life, in particular making me incredibly self-conscious about having to dance in public.  Pash (her real name might have been Katie, I couldn't keep track) was however a far nicer person than the fanatical Mrs. McGrath;  all the performers seemed by and large to be nice, friendly, decent people.  This as near as I can tell is well in keeping with the overall philosophy of contemporary K Records acts and releases.  All the acts save one performed mostly vocal music with minimal instrumental backing, and the point of their lyrics seemed in general to be to embarrass the hell out of themselves with honesty.  At any rate, midway through the first song I started to get really dizzy and uncomfortable from having my head flat on concrete, so I sat up, bracing myself to be called out for breaking the K Records sockhop rules, but thankfully I never was.  Pash and Anna Oxygen, who played some fairly energetic synth-poppy stuff akin to a G-Rated  urlLink Gravy Train!!!  (but not as shouty) were both heavily reliant on what I would call an extremely invasive approach to audience participation.  In Pash's case we have the requirement of particular postures for listening, in Anna Oxygen's case the audience was expected to engage in some fairly heavily choreographed dance moves.  I sat quietly on a sofa in the back.  I don't really know what to make so much of that kind of expectation of your audience.  Part of me, whenever I acquiesced to the demands for handclaps or snapping or humming or whatever, expected to be denounced from the stage for being a lemming and falling for the performer's ruse along with the rest of the audience.  Even putting that concern aside I feel like maybe it's an attempt to force a cameraderie with the audience that doesn't really exist and feels sort of fake.  It's a nice gesture and a nice idea, certainly, to want to connect with your audience, and appealing to everybody's (or at least most punk kids') sense of "let's-all-put-on-a-show" is certainly one of the least cynical senses to appeal to;  it would be nicer if it would just happen naturally, instead of making people uncomfortable.  I think one of the reasons I felt uncomfortable (besides memories of kindergarten) was that I knew nobody there.  I think that if I, like the rest of the audience, were in a situation where the people who would see me just abandon a part of my decorum and start acting silly were friends instead of strangers.  The Dirty Projectors (aka Dave) didn't go in for choreography as much, although there was still a little crowd participation.  He had two kinds of song:  some really neat, innovative hip-hoppy stuff which was apparently remixed out of a soundtrack or score he had written, and later on some acoustic material in which he demonstrated a strong similarity to Morrissey (in a good way).  Second to last was [[[VVRRSSNN]]], known to his dentist as Adam.  The original email I recieved says that he is ex-Yume Bitsu, which holds absolutely no significance for me whatsoever.  I met him outside before the show and struck up a conversation with him;  I was disappointed to learn that he was one of the bands and not from Bloomington.  There followed an amusing exchange in which his pronunciation of the word "syncretic" as "syncratic" led to his thinking I'm a moron who doesn't know what syncretism is.  I just wanted to know what "syncratic music" was.  It sounds like a neat idea, doesn't it?  Like some sort of antihierarchical model of improvising or composing.  I guess I may as well lay claim to it.  Misunderstandings aside he seems like a real nice guy.  His set sounded exactly like  urlLink the Durutti Column  (the band that gets continually made fun of in  24 Hour Party People  - I had the misfortune to buy two of their albums before I realized that the first one I bought wasn't just a fluke and they always sound like that).  It lasted about an hour.  I almost fell asleep.  Still, nice guy.  The last act was the Blow.  She's pretty fuckin' good and I recommend you take the opportunity to see her play should it present itself.  Apparently she was in Madison last night with the rest of the bill, which means that that probably won't be for a while.  Her act was the epitome of anti-rockstarism.  She mostly talk-sang, either over prerecorded backing or accompanying herself on the nylon-strung guitar all the bands were sharing.  Thematically she kept pretty much to the "honesty and embarrassment" covered previously but less skilfully by the other bands.  People.  Whatever.  I won't dork out by attempting to get too musicological on this one.  Overall it was a good show played by a group of truly swell human beings.   P.S.   Pash closed her set with a cover of Kelis's "My Milkshake", which for my money is one of the best eight or nine songs ever.
