Made it in 20... but it woulda been more fun to jus go by strolling instead of having to whizz past some old ladies.      I jus found the worst pun in my About section thingy... I feel so bad. But it's a good song, so I guess I can let it slip. I sure would love a car though. One that I could drive legally. One day I'll have my hott lil sex car... CD player on full blast as I fly down Ventura w/ no traffic @ night. Wishful thinking I guess, but I can dream.      I wanna go to the mall and just sit on one of those couches... observing people. I just can't think of very many other places where so many different people come together peacefully (most of the time.) I'd love  to drag Aaron along and have him and I do a duet for chump change next to JCPenny.  I'm sure gonna miss you, man. I hate to make it sound like some evil, permenant... thing, 'cause it's not. I'll jus stop here so I don't go into a whole "bye for now" speech.         I'm thinkin of changin my temp. I wanna go back to my old one. I liked that one, 'cept this time I wont add so much crap. Like that stupid guest book. I had like......  4  people sign it. Eh, Im off. Getting sleepy.
