I highly advise you take a look at the glaring factual inaccuracies that many people in the media are picking out.  It is disappointing that such an "important", as described by certain Moore activists, movie is made irrelevant because the man can't seem to grasp the idea of fact checking.  I am not taking any position on quality or the talent of Moore in making movies, as I have yet to see Bowling for Columbine, something I plan to watch this weekend, and I probably will never see his newest endeavor given its factual misgivings and its virulent view of the President.  In my short 10 minute search for legit sources listing Moore's fictional escapades, I even found this  urlLink Wall Street Journal editorial  that hammers Moore's facts in for his Columbine movie.  I don't know about you but this devalues the legitimacy of the movie when I watch it.  Every scene regardless if it a good scene or if it makes a telling point, in the back of my head will be "is this bullshit?".  I guess what I think matters little as I suppose most people, who see the movie, will sadly swallow Moore's claims.  Nonetheless, I give Moore credit for his latest movie.  He knows the average American is highly uneducated on foreign policy and lazy; thus, most of the liberally oriented people who actually see his movie will accept his version of the facts wholeheartedly.  He wants to affect the election as he has so frequently claimed. What better way then releasing for intents and purposes a anti-Bush propaganda piece that he has characterized as "political satire" in the guise of a documentary.  I also have heard that Moore is reposting aticles on his own website but editing comments that mention his critics.   Maybe I'll check that out and get back to that one later.  (edited:  I checked, yes he did edit out references to the two websites listed at the bottom of this post.  My response: lame, the article is praising him too, very sad.  )  That is pretty sad.  I have enabled comments, so feel free to chime in.    Some places of interest I found   urlLink moorewatch   urlLink moorelies
