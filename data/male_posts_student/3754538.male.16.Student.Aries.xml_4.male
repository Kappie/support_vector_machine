Everyone's always against the Empire because they're the " bad  guys." But think for a minute. The " good  guys" are the REBELLION. Some key words in the that are REBEL and REBELLION.  re*bel - To refuse allegiance to and oppose by force an established government or ruling authority.   re*bel*lion - Open, armed, and organized resistance to a constituted government.   Let's get this straight. The "good guys" are in opposition of the current ruling government? The "good guys" have a dying religion on their side, that was and is persecuted by the ruling government  making the ruling and established government the " bad  guys."   Looking at what we've found out it becomes obvious that the names need to be switched. The "good guys" should be the government in power. The "bad guys" the rebels. Just like in the middle east. The (good guys/ middle eastern government/ empire) are being attacked by the (bad guys/ raical terrorists/ rebel alliance).   P.S. I dont want to hear any Star Wars history lessons proving my arguement wrong. I'm going purely off the three older movies and ignoring everything else.
