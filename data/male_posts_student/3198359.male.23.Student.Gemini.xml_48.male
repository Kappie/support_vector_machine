Today, The browser with the identity crisis has a sleek new interface, modern features, and is blowing the doors off its competition... and this is putting it mildly.   My take: great improvements to the browser, however, what I am looking forward to is the completion of the nslTheme so that widgets used in forms are native, in otherwords, when I'm on MacOS, the widgets are Aqua, *NIX they're GTK2 etc. etc.
