Whatever! I almost froze in there, and some guys of the other school were throwing us some cups and we threw them back.  Last night was great! WOWOWOWOW!!! But no details here, my life is a book , but i didn't get this far yet.   When i was coming home - after school- i got a ride with my dad, and he bought another cell phone, and i asked him what he would do with his ex- cell phone, and he said " why? Do you want it?" and i said "Yes", i think i'll get a cell phone, awesome!!!!! I'll give you folks my number, but this phone is a card phone, you buy cards and call people. but it's for a few time, so, prepair yourselves , buy some calling cards, because you'll have to call me. There is a site, that you can send sms for free, however it's in portuguese, no worry, i'll teach you all. Hope my luck to not change, things are going well so far.
