I finally got this desk into my room, beat Legacy of Kain: Defiance (really good game), watched movies that have been over-watched (Spaceballs, and the Austin Powers Trilogy) and am in the last chapter of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This Morning Rhae called and we talked fer a few hours. And that was fun cause I got to talk to her. thats about it besides me talking to other people... and playing over-played games.      Checked by  urlLink Rhae .
