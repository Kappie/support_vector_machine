Thankfully, and unknowingly, a friend of mine had warned me about a certain part of the movie, that I definitely would not have wanted to see.  I kind of guess from the situation that that was where the particular event would occur... so I averted my eyes until I heard the slashing sound and a cry of pain from a man's Achilles tendon being severed.  I very much agree with the same friend on the movie.  I think it was very well written, and the characters were developed very well, but it was like I was looking at a painting... something people say, "That looks nice" and "I love the (insert what you love here)."  I haven't seen many of Tanatino's movies, but I've heard that he really likes to show movies out of order (in a sense), and I know that other movies that have been like that I have sometimes had a difficult time following the plot lines.  But in Kill Bill, I often found myself going, "OOOoooHHhhhh..., I get it."  I was a little sad that Lucy Liu's character died in this volume, I would've loved to see that Nurse chick get it in the stomach, and let Liu live on to the next movie.  It was a good escape for a couple hours.  I can't wait for Volume Two!
