Perhaps it has to do with the fact that I've been in Perth since February without going home -- but that seems to be a rather pathetic reason, considering it's only been a few months, not a few years. And it's not like I've not been away from home for a whole year before -- I did it in 1999, when I was studying in Sydney. Still, I've been having dreams lately about being at home... and a couple of months ago, my dog died while I was here, which makes it  two  dogs in two years who've moved on while I was away. I dunno. I'm just in that kinda mood, I guess. Hopefully this will pass soon.  Anyway, onto brighter and cheerier topics...  *strains hard to think of something* ...   Tonight I have rehearsals for a friend's recording project. Y'see, he's an audio engineering student, and his assignment involves recording and mixing songs; so he asked me to pen a couple of tunes for him. So yeah, tonite we have the entire band practice  with  a mini orchestra: four violins and two cellos -- and I have to play one of the violin parts, in spite of my better judgment. I used to study playing the violin, for just four years...so my playing isn't up to much, and it inevitably sounds like cats mating whenever the bow hits the strings. Heh. Still, I guess practice makes perfect. And I've played the violin (badly) during church services. The congregation always seems more prayerful when I do that. I wonder why.  Anyway, here's a photo of me, my housemate Judi (right), and my dear friend Berni, taken sometime last year. Until next time!
