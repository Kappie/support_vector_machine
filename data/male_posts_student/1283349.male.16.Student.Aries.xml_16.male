On iTunes: Debussy- Clair de lune On PS2: MGS2 Mood: Shagged out after a prolonged squawk  It's been too long since I talked about what keeps me goin' day after day, project after project, Algebra class after Algebra class: Rollin' some dice!  Let's start with some history, shall we?  My mum played the earliest known D known to mankind in college; she didn't use rulebooks or anything. Gygax didn't get a frickin' penny. Once upon a time in 4th grade, I was home sick. Whilst in bed, I became quite bored, and to entertain my malleable young mind, my dear old mother taught me the game that would become my...HOBBY. Of course, it was an esoteric and arcane version of the rules, but it caught my interest immediately, and after she ran me through a dungeon or two of devious traps and foul monsters, my imagination was fraught with Power Gaming schemes...already. So, I continued playing this butchered (perhaps more elegant, perhaps not enough dice involved) version of D with some school chums. Then, one day at an innocent outing to my grandparents' house for some brouhaha, I was talking with a favorite cousin of mine, Danny. He was some bit older than me (Just a teensy tiny decade and a half or so), and had a semi-regular campaign. He suggested I buy the Player's Handbook. "The what-a-what Book?!" I gasped. He repeated his last suggestion. I gasped again, then bought the book the very next instant I could. I greedily devoured the entire 300 page tome of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons goodness in a single night. This was, mind you, 5th or 6th grade. I was quite the bookworm, as it seems. Heh, I still am, to a larger degree even. So, I made my first ever character...the illustrious Neutral Good Elven Ranger, Delebar Silversword. And so it began...  The next thing you know, I'm the 11 Year Old WonderRanger at all of the cons around Dallas, hacking it up with the best of'em. Young Caleb and Young Delebar progressed through the ranks of Hack-Jockeys faster than most, and it showed...Young Caleb won all the role-playing awards, quickly chalking up points in the RPGA, while Del racked up the kills, piling on the treasure. Before you know it, Caleb is in the top ten at every con and Del is pushing...-=10th level=-!  Good times.  More of the continuing saga of the Dice Squirrel later.  -Dice Squirrel From Wee Hackling to Mighty Hack-Jockey
