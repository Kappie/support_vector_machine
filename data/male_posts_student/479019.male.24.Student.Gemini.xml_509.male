I saw 30 year olds with disney cartoons. It was interesting seeing goth and punk folks too. I thought the coolest thing was seeing a pretty hardcore looking dude with tats all over and a Jim Neidhart goatee and his matching wife with their kids.  I was actually totally planning to get a tattoo this summer, but with the lack of hours... I dunno if I can afford it.  ***
