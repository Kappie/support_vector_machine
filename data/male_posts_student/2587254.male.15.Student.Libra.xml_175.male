At last I'm done my history and stuff...and now all I'm going to be doing is cramming for math and biology exam. WHOO HOO! Yeah school year is coming to an end...I'm so excited. Gr. 10 was such a quick year. In no time I'll be in university...kinda scary when I think about it =S. Oh well...that's for another time...right now I got other things to do.  This morning history presentation I think went well. We had locker cleanout, and Christian showed me a 2000 yearbook of our school. Apparently we had a golf team. Hmm.....I didn't have much to clean out so threw out a few papers and that was basically it. Oh yeah I also got my timetable for next year:   Day 1 -gr. 12 bio -Gr. 11 chem -Music -Gr. 11 Law  Day 2  -Physics -PAS -Math -English   Civics....lost election =( lol.  And now to summarize the rest of my day since I gotta cram for bio:  Math...review programming...slacked off practiced for music after school....solo tomorrow =S bus ride home...slept on bus, traffic jam from a car accident up ahead then went to Library volunteer orientation  Hmm apparently at the library thing.....I saw Melody....and this girl May Tang I think Carmen knows...and someone that used to be on my MSN list. Wait I think she still is on...but point is I've never met her lol.  Anyways back to studying for bio.  Btw...need prayers for exams haha. Thanks for those who are prayin' for me=P.  Later.
