Well first I guess a definition - or better yet, let me link to you to a survey of definitions  urlLink http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=townies=1 . Well apart from the fact that my college is infested with the little fuckers, the sell-out craze as I like to call it (when townies in an area increases) is in full throttle there. I have a messed little theory that pre-townie, the devil (ie older teens who are already townies) tempt them just like Jesus was in the desert, and the majority of the time they give in (the girls especially think they look more attractive putting themselves across as good time girls rather than people with any sense of morals or values).   Anyway at college at the moment there is this party coming up, (which I think my friend Rachael is going to i'm not sure) and as always the townies have made it an R'n'B infected event, with no sense of real or decent music involved I'm afraid, but they seem to be ecstatic about the whole cherade, and are weeks into there preparations for it. Anyway, I'll discuss this issue tomorrow in more detail . . . xBuBzx
