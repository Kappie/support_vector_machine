State investigators Tuesday asked Knott's Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain to each shut down one roller coaster equipped with a restraint system that has been the focus of investigations in two recent fatal accidents out of state.  Both parks said they would comply with the request, which comes as amusement parks enter their peak season. State officials said it is the first time they have requested safety improvements based on accidents outside California.  With those cases in mind, officials from the California Department of Occupational Safety and Health on Tuesday asked Knott's Berry Farm to close Xcelerator and asked Six Flags Magic Mountain to close Superman: The Escape until fixes can be made.  "We've asked them to modify the restraint systems to enhance the safety of the rides and keep the rides closed until modifications are made," said department spokesman Dean Fryer.   In the past, the state has ordered changes only on rides that had accidents.   Fryer said state investigators have not issued an official order to shut down the two attractions because the parks agreed to comply. Both parks previously had said the equipment was safe and that the rides did not need to close.  Six Flags officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday afternoon. The company has said it has begun changing restraints on some of its other attractions, including the Superman roller coaster in Massachusetts.  Susan Tierney, a Knott's spokeswoman, said the park voluntarily closed the Xcelerator coaster while park officials decide what to do. It's unclear when the ride will reopen, she said.   O-kay.  Yup.  Because we all know that Xcelerator and Superman:  The Escape have  horrible  track records.  I mean, look how many people have died on them!  Oh wait... NOBODY HAS!   Seriously, why the fuck do we need to go and change something when it's doing just fine.  Hell, I've felt safer on Xcelerator than Jaguar!  I really love how overly safe we are.  God knows that we can't  BLAME THE RIDER  for what they did.  Oh no, it HAS to be because the ride or the park did something wrong.  God forbid the person was a fucking idiot.  Nope, because if we admitted that, OSHA/DOSH would be out of a job.  Here guys, come and fuck up our rides.  Lets make them overly zealous when it  comes to safety!  Even though they haven't killed anyone, lets go ahead and make it super ultra not fun and safe.  Hell while were at it, I think Knott's should take even  FURTHER  initiative and do some more modifications...  Rollcages on Timber Mountain Log Ride:  God knows the logs could magically roll over and kill EVERYONE on board.  Over The Shoulder Restraints (OTSRs) on Kingdom of the Dinosaurs:  Safety is everything here, who knows when someone could be dragged under the amazingly fast 1/2 mph moving vehicles.  OTSRs on Jaguar:  Oh those banked turns are so dangerous.  Who knows when someone could fly out!  Roll Cages and OTSRs on Calico Mine Ride:  Those trains are sure old and dangerous, lets make sure nobody falls out and is dragged under.  Wheeler Dealer Bumper Car speed reduction:  That 1/4 mph speed right now is just TOO fast.  Lets knock it down to 1/12 mph.  Safety Cages on Supreme Scream:  Just in case you suddenly fall out, you'll land in the safety cage.  Spin reduction on Hat Dance:  Those lateral G's are just  begging  to toss someone out.  Lets stop it completely.  La Revolucion swing/spin reduction:  Oh no!  Someone could surely fall out!  Lets make it swing 10 feet up in the air and have it spin at 1/2 RPM.  OTSRs on benches and chairs:  Who knows when you might fall out while feeding your god damn fat face!  Ugh..anyway.  In closing.  Fuck DOSH/OSHA.  Fuck KBF.  Fuck SFMM.  Fuck fuck fuck DOSH/OSHA.  Fucking bastards.
