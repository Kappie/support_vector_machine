We lost the toss for fielding, we batted but to no good results.We managed tohold them down to a 0-0 tie for the 1st  2nd inning.We hadalot of confidence after all these good job, but soon became the opposite when some morale sinker came in the 3rd inning, where they hit my stamina-weaken pitch for a 2 run.All that nonsense came just after that very incident. 11 runs were brought in, we were feeling helpless about it, as more and more of us make mistakes. Nothing could help my stamina improve in the game itself, as my pitch became slower, nice for them to hit. This inning ended with a pop-fly to Jia Yuan. the game ended, with a scoreline of 12-0. Everybody performed very inadequately, i am not excluded, If only i had more stamina to pitch like what i did in the 1st and 2nd inning, the game would be some 0-0, since our fielding is not very good especially 2nd base, with nobody to fill that gap. I am looking forward to the game against PeiCai, hopefully we can beat them. Together with RI, i hope that they both get eliminated in this very stage, i really want a national position.  Is my blog boring? Tell me what i should add in my blog, or maybe give me the link of the others which you think it's nice
