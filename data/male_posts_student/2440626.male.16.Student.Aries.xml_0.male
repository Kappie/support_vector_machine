I got a plethora of cool/nifty things including but not limited to: A huge-gantic culinary encyclopedia, an alarm clock radio, clothes, and  ALIAS SEASON 2 DVD (most important).  Also, a shoutout to R and Abby.  Hope you enjoyed the cookies.  I am now just going to enjoy the rest of my Christmas vacation.  Signing off.
