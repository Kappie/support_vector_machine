Not even the excuse of being cut out from the Net due to my Internet router failing and having to be replaced sounds good enough.  That being said, I'm totally enjoying the new router that I picked up today. Heard alot about  urlLink Netgear  products but never had the chance to try because of their much higher price. But nowadays prices for networking devices are so low that they are all about the same level anyways. Best thing is that it came bundled with a laptop wireless card, which I passed to my mom, for only a small sum.     >    It's deep into assignment/project time here in my 2nd term at school. (heh, not only is it my 2nd term of the year, but it's also the 2nd last term of my course). Of which I have completed a presentation and a programming assignment. These two have been the reason for my lack of presence here as well as my lack of sleep, all due to pretty last minute crunch time work done on them. Thus next time, for the remaining assignments and projects, I'm going to start early so as to hopefully prevent another similar occurrence. But with all the due dates close together, as well as the amount of study and research needed to even attempt them, I foresee future sleepless nights.  Still, no excuse to repeat another 2 week long blog absence.
