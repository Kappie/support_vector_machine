Then u read this article which dates back to 2003. topic: homosexuality. below are the ASTOUNISHING CONCLUSIONS drawn by researchers.  1)when males and females are exposed to a loud noise, they blink in somewhat different ways -- except that   lesbians   appear to  blink like    men  , not like women.  2)An  identical twin  of a   gay person   is about   twice as likely   to be   gay   as a fraternal twin would be.  3)50 to 60 percent of   sexual orientation   might be  genetic .  4)some studies show    most gay    men have a larger isthmus of the corpus callosum -- which may also be true of   left-handed people  . And that's intriguing because gays are    39    percent more likely to be left-handed than straight people.  5) a male is more likely to be gay if he has older brothers; for each    older brother    he is about   33   percent more likely to be gay.  Then, i saw a paragraph that goes like this : O.K., these theories are potentially junk science until the studies are replicated with much larger numbers. ( i felt cheated)  BUT THEN, the next line .....  "we also SHOULD NOT ignore the accumulating EVIDENCE."  What shall we do?!!!?? is there anyone in our class who fits in the description???
