If you are not running a firewall (hardware or software) chances are your computer could become infected with a virus or other malicious software.  That virus then can be transmitted throughout your Local Area Network (your home or SOHO) and even back out onto the internet where it can cause mass chaos.  That's how a lot of spam emails are sent from your own email address without you even knowing!  Today I am showing you a  FREE  firewall from Zone Labs for home use.  You will be able to determine what can and cannot enter or exit your computer.  You will also be able to block certain applications from going out and keep viruses and hackers out of your system.  I would take advantage of this nice product even if you are on 56k it will still keep your computer safe.
