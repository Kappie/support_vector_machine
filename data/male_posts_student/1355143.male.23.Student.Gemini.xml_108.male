I dont know how many of you were at Walkers place that day we tried to make it a little funky but the boy fought!!!! Constance is going to bring her camera to school in the next few days to take a picture and we will be getting that kind of evidence soon.   Another thing with the new look every user has a profile so please click on me to see what it looks like and if you want to make your own you can do it on the dashboard.   Later,  Ãšlli
