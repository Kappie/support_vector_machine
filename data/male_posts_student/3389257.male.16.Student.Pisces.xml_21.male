I have siblings of two in number, one being male and a twin, the other a smaller sister. The names of both children concerned is little business of yours. In other related articles (being about me)I am moving to durham soon. many people think it is good, on balance, many think it is bad. The change in scenary from the usual happenings of bradford may be refreshing. I hope it is. I wet the bed also.      I'd like to take this oppotunity to say goodbye to many of my friends properly: Booth...You large gay object you (its funny coz hes small and straight). Gornall...you've been a large factor in me coming out of school unscathed. Luke P, god bless you man...for you make me chuckle a wee bit. Tother luke, you make me chuckle slightly less, and you probably will never get to see this. Hollie, Goodbye, good luck next year, stay cool.Squeet, You are rather swell, I will miss you alot much. Simon, my bestest jazz loving beatle's playing "daddy". Lucy, you've been a rock, and although we lost touch, and only just got back in, i feel i can trust you, you shall be missed, you to alyce. Jade, what can be said, you are not so good at drawing, but the friend thing you have down. Lamis and Laura, you will probably never see this either, I hope you do, you have been kind to me, if we ignore the taunting, i love you both goodbye. Thanks to everyone who has touched my life at my school..that is most people. I Will never forget any of you. Stay cool. I will regularly keep this site updated with my ongoings life.
