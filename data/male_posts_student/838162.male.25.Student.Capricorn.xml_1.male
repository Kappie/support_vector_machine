I have an idea of what could be increasing the feeling, but I refuse to allow my mind to dwell on it. Because if it did, it may actually believe it to be true and that would only drive my whole being into a whirring pit of despair. And that would not be nice. For me or the people around me.  Heh. If my dear Agony Aunt   MichWng   were to hear about this, she scold me for being “antsy” again and lovingly bite my head off. Hope she’s not reading this. If you are Mich, I’m sorry, don’t hit me! :)    I’m feeling much better now than in the afternoon. Had a somewhat bad day at work again so I think that’s adding to the depression. Many thanks to   Dex   for ICQ chatting with me. It really made me feel much better.  I have been trying to write out a new technical article to put up here but I seem to keep pushing it back and back again. All I seem to be doing is random postings that reflect the not so calm that my life is in right now. Frankly I don’t think a lot of people would like to read it. Anyway the article I’m planning to right is some tips and hints for new Palm OS PDA users. I mean there are so many articles and reviews about which Palm to buy but after to do get it, than what? How do you make sense of all the programs out there and what programs would make the most of your device? That’s some of the questions that I hope to address. If you would like to read it, let me know. Some aspiration would be really good to get me off my a$$ to finish it.   >
