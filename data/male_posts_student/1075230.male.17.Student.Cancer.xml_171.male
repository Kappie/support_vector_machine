I sneaked out of the house at 1 to try to see the Perseid Meteor Shower, but noticed it was too bright. Upon re-entering the house, I looked it up and found the best time to watch would be 5 am, so I hope to wake up then (I really want to watch, but the last time I planned to wake up for a celestial show did not work too well =P aka too tired).   Oh, btw, it was a miracle neither parents woke up (they're light sleepers), because I had to turn off the alarm and chime, and turn it back on. That makes some chirping noise. Also, the main door is kinda squeaky.    Ok... so anyway, the week started out with my mom adding 2 two-page chinese letters to my relatives onto my workload. Fun. So I was like... "must remember to search this blog's archive sometime to see what I've been up to for the past few months".    A few weeks before that, I had an idea of searching for my old trivia questions (we had 3-4 trivia questions to do for gifted, it was our "homework") to put on my site. Kinda like a database for random, fun facts. I remember copying the more interesting trivia questions onto a piece of paper before dumping the whole pile (yes, pile... I took the trivia homework very seriously and ended getting first place for points... but that's beside the point).    So... after some restlessness, I decided to start searching my room for the trivia questions. I ended up not finding them. I could bet almost anything it had to do with my mom's interference with my orderly mess (oxymoron there). It makes me really angry when she fools around and misplaces everything, and I end up not finding the items I want back. It's even worse when she blames  me  for losing those things. Um.. getting off-track here...   The point is... it made me feel like I lost some part of me. A memory of sorts. I worked really hard on the trivia questions, and they bring back memories... Agincourt library... the old man with white hair that always helped me (he's still there, and I'm wondering if I should go up to him and thanks him some day)... my prize for getting the highest marks in trivia (which got stolen then returned... another story)... and I guess that sheet of paper was kinda like a physical item to represent all that. It would help me remember when I had forgotten...   ... like some other items in my room that helped me remember other stuff... grad photos, math contest reviews (not a happy memory... my dad put so much pressure on me to do well, I remember crying before the contest), printed photos (thanks to my sister's improper use of her school's laserjet =P ), outline and pictures of a story which fell flat... etc   Oh, and back to that letter-writing and archive thingy I wrote about near the beginning, I found that the archive was down. Another part of the past which is temporarily or permanently lost.    To some people, the past doesn't matter. I have at least one friend of that opinion: never look backwards, waste of time. I find that that's not a good idea... your past makes up who you are, and one should always try to understand it. Some other people, like me, spends a little too much time looking into the past. Well, I guess it isn't that bad, as long as it doesn't hinder your progress in the present. I'd hate to think of what'll happen when I grow old... probably spend my days living in the past =P   Sorry for the long post, anyway, I should get some sleep. I want to see the Perseid Meteor Shower at 5am, it could be something to remember =P   ~ Chronos
