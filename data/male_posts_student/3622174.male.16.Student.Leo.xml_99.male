So, I'm here to share some of the stories that happened last year and even the year before.  I've got two stories today...and they're both about my good ol' buddy Courtney.  Here they are:  -2002 Camp Story: Courtney Meets the Pool- Courtney is hilarious.  Very unpredictable, you never know what she's going to do.  Me, her, and Melissa were all hanging around the hotel one night, and Courtney all of a sudden got really quiet.  So, we came up to around the pool, and all of a sudden, Courtney walks off and starts circling the pool.  All of a sudden, she stops, stares at the pool, and just plops in.  I looked at Melissa for a second, thinking, wow, is she crazy or something?!  Turns out, yes, she is, but a good kind of crazy.  -2003 Camp Story: Courtney and the Broken Dishes- This is how it all began: how the 2004 Yearbook Staff became so clumsy.  I was the original klutz on the yearbook staff, and something happened this past year, and we had a bunch of them.  Alright, so, the first night of camp, they had an ice cream social thingy, where they gave out free pizza...eh, I mean, ice cream, obviously.  While the rest of the staff sat around eating ice cream, I got up to put my dish back up on the tray that they had set up for dirty dishes.  It was a pretty high stack, and I thought I would definitely be the one to drop the dishes.  I put my dish down, everything's fine.  I didn't realize Courtney and Elizabeth were behind me putting their dishes down, and all of a sudden, CRASH!  I'm thinking "oh shit, what did I do now?"  But, it wasn't me.  It was Courtney.  And Elizabeth.  Broken dishes and melted ice cream everywhere.  All of a sudden, there's this huge crowd of people from our school and other schools with cameras surrounding them, taking pictures of the whole thing.  They just sat there laughing while hotel management came to clean it up. At the end of the workshop, they showed this slideshow of pictures that were taken during the whole week, and Courtney, Elizabeth, and the broken dishes showed up...and we all expected it.  We have some pictures of that, and, if I can snag one and scan it in through the yearbook room, I'll do it, but, not until school starts.  Yeah...definitely a good one.  The second story was better than the first, but, oh well.  I wonder what kind of stories will come out of this year... dunno, but, there's only 4 more days until we leave.    Later tonight, Late Night Bloggin' returns after a 4 day hiatus.  As for Digital Lust, I think I'm just going to shut it down until I come back from the New York State.  Maybe by then, the interweb will have more stuff to see.  So, until then, bye!
