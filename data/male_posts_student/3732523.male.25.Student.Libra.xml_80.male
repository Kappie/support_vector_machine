But until then...  It's hard to believe, I take posession of my house a week from this Friday.  Go me!  I'll have to take my cam and take pictures for everyone to see.    Shit.  There's so much work to do.   I think I'm going to dig up something for lunch.  I'm starved.  I've got a potroast in the crockpot and that's not helping much either, cause it's starting to smell goood.  TTFN.
