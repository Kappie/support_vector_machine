But wait, it seems the God of Abraham has been playing a few tricks on us people of faith lately.  As you may recall from your notes, Al Qaeda wants to kill us in the name of God.  It seems like we are in bad shape if the terrorists have The Big Guy on their side.  But hold on!  President Bush says God is with him!  Now we have a conundrum.  Does God just like messing with us and having hideous atrocities carried out in the name of God?  Does the "do not kill rule" only apply if the crime is not carried out in God's name?  You would think that loop-hole would be included on the tablet.  "Thou shall not kill in any name other than Mine"  So who will be victorious?  God or God?  Which one is acceptable:  Death to America in the name of God, or Death to Al Qaeda in the name of God?  Perhaps one side is misinterpreting something, then again, maybe both are.  Why is the "thou shall not kill" commandment so flaky?  Jesus gave it to us again in "love thy neighbor," but neighbor must not apply to everyone.  Why is the Almighty Deity's code so hard to crack?  In the end, who will be tossed in the Lake of Fire?  Now that Good and Evil have some gray areas, how do we know how to behave?  When will God step in and shout, "For the love of Me, you people are nuts!"  Now don't get me wrong, I support defense.  I don't want terrorists killing me and my friends for being a citizen of the United States.  Go troops!  But, I don't like how this has become God vs. God.  Can't we leave it at I'm Going to Kill You vs. Please Don't Kill Me?  Thank you, and may God bless America.
