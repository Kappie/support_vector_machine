We can consider this my new toy for the time being.  Don't expect me to be interesting or entertaining or even worth your time.  That's not why I'm here.  In fact, you probably took a wrong turn and found your way here.  Best be on your way, you don't want to be late.  My name is Charles, aka Darkmyst.  I'm 24, I live in Florida, and I'm currently engaged to be married tp a beautiful girl named Margy.  She constantly claims I'm not evil, but I've just got her thoroughly brainwashed.  I'm one of those unfortunates who got lost in the real world after highschool, but thankfully this fall I'm finally getting my life back on track and going to college.  I'm already a amateur programmer, but with some school I'll fill in the gaps and get the paper to back me up.  I intend to leverage the additional skills I accrue in my mission to take over the world.  Wish me luck!  Anyway, let's see if I continue to use this, eh?  Darkmyst
