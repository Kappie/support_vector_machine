She told me no cause she says she has to 'grow up". I don't quite buy it. I think she's just using that as cover instead of telling me something that she knows might hurt me. But I really can't do or say anything that would change her mind so I guess I just have to move on. Bringing me to Monday. Boring day, all I really did was sit back and be a freakin bum all day in my PJ's which are just shorts. Anyway's Monday kinda just rolled on and I felt miserable all freakin day till Crystal called. Once again she cheered me up. Always does. Now yesterday, Tuesday, I go to my ROTC thingy in the Manzano Mtns. Its not all work or anything, we got to climb those fake walls which I set a 34 second record on, very cool, pick apples and eat them, very fresh and tasty, and we also got to swim. Well on to my point. Later I was in the pool and this girl Shawna, I still can't spell her name, got in with me. We were just talking and they started playing some music, she swam over to me and we just started dancing in the freakin pool. Super cool, cause she's a uber hottie, like hot enough to make the sun look like a frozen ball of ice. Asian-Hispanic with green eyes that seem to glow sometimes, that perfectly complement her slim light brown body, large breasts, and perfect heart shaped ass. Anyways, I danced with her at Military Ball and she told me then that I was "incredibly hot" and that she really liked me. I told her then wasn't a good time and she completely understood. But yesterday she wrapped her legs around me while we danced and then she asked me out and leaned in to kiss me, I turned away and told her "I can't". I think its cause I still feel bad about Lauren, and cause I feel kinda like I'm cheating on her if I do something. Anyways she blushed and let go of me and left. Her friends told me she went to the girls restroom crying. I felt pretty bad. She called me up last night and said she wanted to talk. So I went and we talked. She asked me out again and I told her "I couldn't yet." And well she started crying again. Right in front of me. She just started telling me hoe she'd never liked anyone this much before and how she has dreams about me, and lots more. I told her she really doesn't want to date me and that well, she'd be better of with someone else, she just shrugged, and said she had to go home and left. I felt really horrible for hurting yet another person. I always have hurt everyone around me. My friend Priscilla says me and Crystal are meant to be, just a matter of when, but she knows it'll happen. I doubt it, and even if she and I were to get close enough to date, well I wouldn't let it happen. She deserves a lot better than me, and well everything her mom went through I don't want to end up putting her through, which knowing myself would happen. I'm just a stupid jerk.   I have so much crap running through my head right now my brain cells are sponatneously exploding. Nobody will shut up about me still having feelings for Amy and Markita. For the last time fuckers, Its feelings of FRIENDSHIP no more, maybe less. I care about them like I would care about any other friend, nothing else.
