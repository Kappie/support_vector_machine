It is so weird that every single semester is a different 'theme' of sorts.  I have noticed that this trend has been present since day ONE of my college education.  Without fail, I loose a friend, or gain a new friend, or have a different path of life each semester.  I have a large life issue, obstacle to overcome, or big exciting event each 6 months almost like clockwork.  The whole environment changes for me each semester.  Things will even be going along just as they were the previous semester, but without fail, it will change by the 3rd week of the new semester, if not much sooner.  ODD really, odd.  I wonder what this semester's theme will be.  Hopefully closure as I leave the state, and a lot of good times.   I really want to strive for meaningfulness in my life.  I'm not sure why, but lately I just have really desired to have meaningful times, people, and events in my life from here on out.  I think it's possibly because I am entering my last semester at Oklahoma, and I want to make it count.  Not so much in the ways I always want to "make it count" with grades, etc.  Of course I always want to and have wanted to have meaningfulness in my life, but this is something different.  As I grow older, I find it harder and harder to want to entertain anything else besides true, honest, caring, sound friendships.  I also want to give of myself more in my surroundings, to people I care about.  I want to be able to open myself a bit more to those that I care about, and feel secure with those individuals.  I want to take advantage of my surroundings, do things that I want to do, etc.  I want to better myself.   Oh, I don't even know what I'm trying to say.  I need organization. I want to pay off each debt I have, streamline bills, reorganize my life, establish relationships with the people I want to take with me when I leave OU.  I can't physically take them with me, so I want to make sure that they are an important part of my future.  Yay, new beginnings are fun.  Who knows what the theme to this semester will be, but I am hoping that it is one of substance and fun.
