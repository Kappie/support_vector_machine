I think it is easy to catch the hyperness around Tiffany. I have never talked so much before and we were able to talk to each other the whole time. And if you are reading this Tiff, Your AWSOME.     Today I just got Road Runner (high-speed internet) YAY, it is about time I finally got it. I love it. Well anyway, i'm gonna go surf some more, c-ya! -Fly with Christ
