(No I'm not doing a conservationist thing here).  The human system can handle only a little bit of poison before it starts to shut down, yet in the west we live amongst car fumes, pesticides, drugs etc. and we think it is normal !?!  What can we do about it?  Well first of all we can look at keeping our bodies clean by avoiding heavily processed foods.  Secondly we can Detoxic regularly by ingesting substances with anti-oxidants in them (Blackcurrent juice is good).  Thirdly, try moving to a small town with trees.
