I'm going to ace the final I can feel it but I'm still praying that my mind can become some what at ease when I actually sit down to take it. I'm worried about chemistry too just because  no one  knows what they are doing in chemistry so it should be funny. Well that's all for now. I had a spear minute so I thought I would post something. The poem, if you want to call it that, was what I felt at the time of when I wrote it. I already got part of what I wanted for Christmas man and that was to get one of my best friends back and before I turn into the big crying baby I become when I think about certain things I'll say talk to you later guys!
