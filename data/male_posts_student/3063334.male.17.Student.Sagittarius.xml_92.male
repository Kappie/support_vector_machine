Are you going to write the scholarship paper for the book Thomas? I think it's due on April 15th. I think you should also add a link to fastweb.com, maybe some people will find some good scholarship opportunities to write for.  Do you have that list of 100 recommended books from collegeboard.com? I have "Candide" next on my list; let me know how good the book is.
