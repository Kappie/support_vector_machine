This is not in Mecca of course, it was at my school during our Hajj Simulation for Islamic Education. I hope one day we could really take picture like this in Mecca one day InsyaAllah.  By the way, I had found again my long lost senior thru her posting at eNovel. She had followed the eNovel since series 1. Good to see you again  urlLink Kak Nieza ! I'll also will be starting my drving theory lesson tomorrow. I know, it's a little bit late but last month I've been out of town for 17 days out of 31 days! So can't even find the time to arrange the class. Wish me luck!  - Sound of  Al-Hijrah  by  Raihan  -
