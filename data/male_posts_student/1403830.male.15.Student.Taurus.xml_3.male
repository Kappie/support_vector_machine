     
      I am beat.  Like falling over beat.  And I am nowhere close to the finish line.  I am stumbling.  I am there, I am waiting.  For who?  For you, the one that called me tonight.  You spent the night, but not at my house.  Understandable, judging from our conversation.  "Oh, but I would..."  No, you wouldn't.  You don't give a fuck.  So quit your masquerading, take off your mask.  And turn away.  Walk away.  And come back when you need me, lord know I'll be here, for you or not.
