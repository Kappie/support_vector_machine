I can see that I love you, and that you love me too.  Your in my dreams, my love shows through. Your in my heart, and I need you.  Come and take my hand, I'll take you to this place. Where love lasts forever. Where there is no shame. I can see it in your eyes, that this is no game, and I can not deny, that our love is the same.  Chorus 2x*
