Kanina was the debut of Lenin, my cousin, and moi was part of it, of course...I was part of the so-called 18 Man Dance...who are roughly 18 guys who were pinilit to join and wear this blue polo thingy and dance with Lenin...  It was kinda fun...throughout the process...i.e. weekend nights of practice...I got to know people, basically they are all connected to Lenin...there's of course some neighbors, Lenin's former classmates, Ninel's (Lenin's brother) classmates/friends...etc.  so there...the debut was fun kanina and Lenin and I had to do the script thingy for the hosts, just last night, and since we were both bangag, we were really exagerrating stuff...  I'm sleepy but I have to write some more...  On another note, Doc Pes gave us another paper and, in my case and that of others, some minor revisions on my thesis statement...which I am planning to do tomorrow...  Still, I'd rather try and do the A-problems in our Calculus book...and I have some stuff to arrange pa tomorrow...man, I have a lot in my plate...sobra, college life is fun, but there are so much responsibilities to handle...shit! It makes me freak out, and time IS wasted in me travelling for at most an hour...if I'm not gonna stop at the mall...  I wish I was a dormer...then, again...I absolutely can not wake myself up...I wish we lived near Ateneo, yeah, that is better...Hah...I have a ton of stuff to do, and I have this feeling that our next long test in Math 21 will be on Thursday...Doc Mara will arrive on Tuesday...  there...now are you happy? I hope you are...me, at this point I am...but there are just a plenty of things to do...shit! fuck! damn!  ...what a closing...
