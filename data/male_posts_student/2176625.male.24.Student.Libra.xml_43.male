It is a very real possibility that in 8-9 months I will have to deal with these issues. I had to stop at Macy's to buy my sister a baby shower gift and with out thinking I bought one for her and one for Les. I am ready to have kids I just wanted to be married first. Les and I are not even together anymore. This is not how I wanted things to be but if it was meant to be then the baby will be mine. In a way I want it to be because what if I don't get married? What if this is it? But then I know the right woman is out there and I don't want her to worry about another woman's child. I don't know what to think but I need everybody's support in this. I'm going home next week and I'm going to tell my family. Les and I have already discussed this. She thinks I should wait until she has the baby to tell them. I don't want to take them by surprise that way. I need to let them know what the situation is because I need their support through this most of all.
