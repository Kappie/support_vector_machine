Brokaw: I know that you and others like you are grateful for the liberation of Iraq. But can't you understand why many Americans feel that so many young men and women have died here for purposes other than protecting the United States?  Allawi: We know that this is an extension to what has happened in New York. And - the war have been taken out to Iraq by the same terrorists. Saddam was a potential friend and partner and natural ally of terrorism.  Brokaw: Prime minister, I'm surprised that you would make the connection between 9/11 and the war in Iraq. The 9/11 commission in America says there is no evidence of a collaborative relationship between Saddam Hussein and those terrorists of al-Qaida.  Allawi: No. I believe very strongly that Saddam had relations with al-Qaida. And these relations started in Sudan. ..."   Maybe Tom should have taken the time to actually read the 9/11 commission report.     With al Qaeda as its foundation, Bin Ladin sought to build a broader Islamic army that also included terrorist groups from Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Oman, Tunisia, Jordan,   Iraq,   Lebanon, Morocco, Somalia and Eritrea. Not all groups from these states agreed to join,  but at least one from each did.  With a multinational council intended to promote  common gooals, coordinate targeting and authorize asset sharing for terrorist operations,  this Islamic force represented a new level of collaboration among diverse terrorist groups.   Why does this lie that the 9/11 Commission found no link persist in the media in the face of numerous statements in the report that al-Qaeda and Saddam WERE cooperating.  They had not yet launched an attack on the US, but they were in the process of sharing resources and capabilities.  That is clearly in the report.  The Left seems to be hung up again on the lack of connection between 9/11 and Saddam.    Does the standard of defending ourselves still require us to accept the first blow from our enemy?  Were we to wait until Saddam and al-Qaeda got their act together and killed a few thousand Americans before the Iraqi was was justified?  The Left still seems to want to treat Terror as a law enforcement problem, confined to waiting for a crime before we can take action.  Can we afford this?
