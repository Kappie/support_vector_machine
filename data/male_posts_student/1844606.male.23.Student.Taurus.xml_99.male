I couldn't stand it.  Called the non-emergency number yet again, but this time decided to speak with an officer.    The music stopped, she came upstairs and told me how absolutely pissed off she was at these two down there.  The dispatcher has their names and I guess any more noise problems result in a hefty fine.  Good to know that the system still works.  And I can try to get back to falling asleep before 2:30 AM without being woken up.
