       
      Every weekend starting now I will post one long post containing a bunch of comments from people who read this blog. The way it's going to work is: You  urlLink e-mail me  with the subject of your e-mail as "blog comment", and the e-mail containing your comments. If your subject is NOT "Blog comment", I may decide not to show it on the site. You've been warned. Example: If you wanted to comment on something, you would put your e-mail's subject to "Blog comment" and then say something like "Good idea, dipshit" in your e-mail. You can leave your name and e-mail if you wish, or you can ask not to have them shown. Then at the end of the week I compile your comments (leaving out the pointless or stupid ones) and post them in a blog on this page.  Simple? E-mail your comments to  urlLink streak@playcs.com .
