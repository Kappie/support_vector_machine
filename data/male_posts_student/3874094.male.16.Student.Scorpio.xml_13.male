At the ending of the entry before this, I mentioned about samurai x. This is a pic taken from the cover of the soundtrack. In case that you have watched samurai x the series, just wanna let you know that the OVA illustrations are so much more beautiful and detailed, which is why kenshin looks different here than in the series...
