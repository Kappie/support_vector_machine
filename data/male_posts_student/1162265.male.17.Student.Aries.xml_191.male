Most poor people are kept from revolting because of work being so stressful.  Most of us in school are too involved socially to actually be as serious as we should be scholarly.  It's like humans evolved from things that eat, sleep, and have lots of pointless sex.  We built a building around this primative stuff (called Civilization), and we go to the highest floors, hoping to stay as far away from the stuff at the bottom.  But at the same time, the stuff our civilization is built around, is what we most love.  So strange.
