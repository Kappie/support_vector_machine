He's the kind of guy that if he was older, you wouldn't want your girlfriend meeting. forget older, you just wouldn't want your girlfriend meeting him. unless your a gay woman, but even then, it has been known.   well I think we're moving around the 10th of July......aarg...me no want to move.   your storms will break me, you'll send me out to sea, maybe you never existed I don't know, I'll wake up someday is this real anyway? if I do wake up I'd want you to know ,   that these were the best times, and this was the best day,   Your lipstick on mirrors, your perfume and kisses, maybe I never kissed you I don't know, your smile it beats us, is this up to us? if I do wake up I'd want you to know,  that these were the best times, and this was the best day,  that this was the best day, and it makes me think of summer, that this was the best day, and it makes me think of summer, yeah you make me think of summer, yeah you make me think of summer,   have a great summer everybody, i will miss you all.
