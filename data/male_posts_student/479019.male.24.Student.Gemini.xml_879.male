Inhye is doing a talk at a  urlLink conference  on campus this morning, also  urlLink Melissa  is doing a dance for PAL's Barrio. I hope I get a chance to take a nap this afternoon.  I have to do some reading for class Monday and I also want to get to work on one of my papers (which I will ultimately be presenting at a conference in October).  I'm looking forward to seeing Brand New next weekend and I'm thinking of having the potluck next Sunday... or perhaps the following one. Not sure yet. Who should I invite? Then I'm really looking forward to the Bouncing Souls show. That'll really rock. I'm gonna keep pestering people to go.  ***
