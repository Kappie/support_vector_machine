Today it was wake up, decent shower, coffee, and email checkage.  The kids are coming in today, and I've got stuff to do, so there's incentive...but is that it?  Or can I pull the next five weeks on the same schedule?    Probably not.  Don't mind if the blog slows a bit, or becomes politically-oriented again.  I'll get back to talking about shit.
