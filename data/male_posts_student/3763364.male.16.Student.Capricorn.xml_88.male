His cryptic voice behind those ravaging guitars. It haunts me, you know, but I love it, and that is the very reason why.  The sun will rise soon. I wonder what color it will be today. Maybe red. British Columbia burns to the ground, and that stained the sun red once before. It was pretty, devastating, but pretty, a lot like most things.   I will live to publish this. It's like the diary of Anne Frank, except I'm the bloody nazi.
