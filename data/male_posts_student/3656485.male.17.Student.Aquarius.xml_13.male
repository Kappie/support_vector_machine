Upon inspection of my inner self during a conversation I had with Jennifer tonight, I find myself to be more shallow and introvertedthan I had ever imagined. Have I nothing better to talk about than the goings on of other people? Where is my life? Lost in the limbo of peer comformity. In an attempt to mingle with the crowd I have given up my own morals and identity. I find myself to be moreover, cynical of others attempts to find themselves while I sit back and neglect my own needs and desires to become an individual. Props to all of those who found their way allready. I think I have a long road ahead of me. But not all is lost. Now that I've realized a small piece of my discontent, I feel that what was once ano-through sign is merely nowayeild to oncoming trafficon my way out of this parking lot of self doubt and worthlessness. And Yanni, I believe that one day we shall both learn to love others as much as we love the music.  I would also like to apologize now to all of those people I've made fun of in the past. My bad guys...  "Gee,I have great thighs!" - (Thanks, Pavel)
