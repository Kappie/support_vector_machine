(god i might be gay) but i looked so weird walking home... i was wearing skater shoes, white jeans, white T-shirt, 2 "punk braclets" on the left arm, a gay braclet with them, 3 peices from a sink on my right hand, a pinky ring on the other hand, a chain neclace, big ass earphones, preppy "cool" sunglasses, and a backwards hat with a pink flower in it. thats weird... i just wear what is comfortable. yeah i'm going to look like a total fag, but i dont care.  ttfn Cody
