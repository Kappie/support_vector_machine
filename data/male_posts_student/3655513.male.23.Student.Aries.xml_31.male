I spent the weekend out west, and that was more than satisfying. The town of Summerland in the Okanogan Valley was hot and tourist filled, as I personally discovered. Good times on the lake, and too much food (thanks to my hosts) made for an enjoyed visit, if not rushed.  Coming back to the booming metropolis of Calgary, I found the temperature 15 degrees lower, and that I felt rushed and harried in all aspects of my life. Needed to get this done, had to work on this, have this coming up, etc.  With impending deadlines and pressures building, I've found myself neglecting some of my more standardized daily disciplines, and have set today as a starting point to reorder my time and get those disciplines back on track.  I have been occupied by worry a little as of late too, which is odd for me, as I am definately not a worry-wort. I have a friend in Mississauga who is trying to get her life together, and while I offer her all the encouragement and help I can, I worry for her and the outcome of her efforts.  I have another friend who has had a tough couple of years (in the previous 2) and is returning to school this coming september. I worry for her, and pray for her, but am feeling more and more unsettled about her situation as time goes on.  Finally I worry about myself. I worry that one day I won't live up to all the things I need to. That I won't be there for the people who depend on me, or I won't be able to give all that I need to, or come up with the finances I must find time and time again, etc.  I guess I'm just a little short on peace lately. If you have a little to spare, drop me a line.  Rooster
