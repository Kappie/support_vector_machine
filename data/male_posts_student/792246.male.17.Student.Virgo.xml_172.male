I love you all. Except those of you I hate of course.  Haha, I'm such a loser. I'm bringing my iBook with me. And I'm justifying and being all like, "Well, we can watch DVDs in the car!" LOSER!  Plus I'm bringing 5,000,000 DVDs with me, and I'm not really sure why. Oh well.  Wish you were all coming(でもシランさんじゃない。＾＿＾）  -אריק
