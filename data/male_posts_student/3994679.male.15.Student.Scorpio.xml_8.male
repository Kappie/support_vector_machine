If I do or not, you can decide, but some of this is pure truth and some of this is pure fiction. Which is which is for you to decide]         ::The lights dim red and goodbye forever rings throughout the arena as the shadowy figures of Joe Warner and Josh Cohorst appear at the top of the stage. They both make their way down to the ring. joe and josh are both wearing Team Fear the Mullet T-shirts. They pose for the crowd to snap pictures, and joe grabs a microphone.::      JOE : Lately, there's been a lot of talk going on in the Raw Deal world about what team is the best, who is the strongest, and all kinds of bullcrap. You know what I've mainly heard? A lot of random pointless bullshit that really doesn't mean anything. These jabronis from teams like Dark Tower and   Team Evolution have been ranting about how all of the best teams come from the northeast, but Team Fear the Mullet is here to change that. In the Raw Deal world, it may be suprising, but there are good players outside of New York, New Jersey, and Arizona. Barron Vangor Toth may not want you to know this, but it is true. There are several other states out there with some of the top unheardof players in the country.        ::The crowd starts booing and chanting "DARK TOWER! DARK TOWER! DARK TOWER!" but the local hecklers are just feeding Team Fear the Mullet's anger::        JOE : THIS IS  EXACTLY  WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! YOU ARE ALL FED THIS INCORRECT  "TRUTH"  THAT THERE IS NOTHING BETTER OUT THERE, BUT THERE IS A TON BETTER OUT THERE! Team Fear the Mullet is here for the Teams that are not getting the recognition they deserve! Team Fear the Mullet is here to take home some wins for the good guys.       ::The crowd once again loudly lets Team Fear the Mullet hear its opinion, which is "You suck! You suck!" However, Joe and Josh just smile as the crowd belittles them::        JOE : Keep chanting, keep chanting. Remember your chants as we become the most dominant team in all of Raw Deal! Remember your chants when we win the world championship! Remember your chants, because they fuel our hunger. They fuel our hunger for domination. As I sit there and win at Gencon, I will remember your chanting and I will laugh because I know I will prove you all wrong. I will win the big one. And Josh here, just wait until November.       ::Joe throws down the microphone and Team Fear the Mullet stands in the ring taunting the fans as they get pelted with garbage. Josh picks up some of the garbage and starts throwing it back, and eventually the members of Team FTM leave the arena as the cameras fade to black::       So, how did I do? It's probably not as good as it could possibly be, and it IS for a heel team, and I'm not a big fan of heels in efeds. It IS 1:20am, so that could have an effect on it, too...
