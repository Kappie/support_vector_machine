Of course Matt didn't come over. Of course I didn't go to the concert. Of course I sat around with Kris all fucking day watching TV. Of course I got the stomach virus my parents had the last 4 days... Of course I'll probably shitting myself senseless tomorrow.... Of course. Because I posted that I was actually going to do something other than sit here and babble about boring shit. 'Fucking figures... I really need to brush my teeth. I drank like 4 glasses of milk today and they feel all plaque-y. Don't you hate that milk aftertaste in your mouth that you get when it's been an hour since you've had milk and you haven't had anything else since?  I'm going to try a little experiment with this plan-negating blog phenomenon, bear with me: - I am NOT going to make much money this year. - I am NOT going to get a kickass laptop. - I am NOT going to get a girlfriend. - I am NOT going to have fun this summer. - I am NOT going to spend time looking at colleges. - I am NOT going to get a good night's sleep tonight...  (hopefully the converse of the above will happen)
