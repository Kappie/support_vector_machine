I'm sure it'll wear off soon and the truth will replace the fantasy, but for a while I felt like an adult. Where to start? One thing that I really enjoyed was the bathrooms on the campsite. Hear me out. You could hear everything being said in the adjoining rooms in that little building. That wasn't the fun part. The fun part was trying to tell if the voices were coming from the boys' or the girls' bathrooms. The voices were the same high pitch; indistinguishable from one another until you heard one crack. The guys on the older end of the junior high spectrum were fascinating. They were all at that stage where they can be squirrely at times, so that they enjoy running around and getting sweaty and dirty ... and smelly. Most of them were not quite used to this stage of development and as a result I saw no deodorant being used. Showers were neglected as well. Needless to say, our very cramped tent had a very disagreeable odor. Luckily I have the use of only one nostril. So I didn't mind that much ... I just thought it was interesting to note. Despite the amusing aspects, and aside from the very annoying ones, junior highers aren't such a bad crowd. In some ways, they're not yet being corrupted by the nasty things about our culture. In other ways, they're just beginning to be corrupted and are still at a stage where they can avoid certain things more easily than they could down the road. Only the adventurous (and early blooming) ones really interacted with the opposite sex. And when I say 'interact' I mean a kind of flirting that lacks any semblance of confidence. But that belongs to the 'amusing' category, not the redeeming one. The thing I liked most about them was that they have a very refreshing faith. They ask questions about God that I sometimes take for granted, or once wondered about but haven't reflected on for a long time. Like, "What happens to people who die without ever hearing about Jesus?" I realized that it's one of those things that I need to look into because I don't quite know where I stand. Sometimes I love being asked a question that makes me realize that I do not, in fact, know the answer. In simpler ways, annoying middle schoolers are philosophers. I don't even know how many times I was asked, 'Why?' One kid walked into the bathroom while I was taking a piss. I'm standing in front of the urinal and he asks me, 'Jacob, what are you doing?' I was too shocked to respond, 'What the hell does it  look  like I'm doing?' That's completely unrelated to what I was going to begin writing about, but I thought it was a worth mentioning. Anyway, they're all philosophers. Freakin little versions of Socrates. I was asked 'Why?' so many times that I ceased to know 'why.' This kid had me stumped as to why I was going to take a shower.  Kid: What are you doing? Me: I'm going to go take a shower. Kid: Why? Me: Because I feel unclean. Kid: Why? Me: Because I  am  unclean. Kid: Why? Me: Because I'm dirty. Kid: Why? Me: Because I need a shower. Kid: Why? Me: Because that's what people do when they're dirty, except for little snot-nosed punks like you. Kid: Why? Me: Why do people shower or why are you a little punk?  Kid shrugs and runs off.   Note to self: the only way to get somebody to stop asking you questions is to question them. But on another note, I've sworn off showers until I've convinced myself (or been convinced) that it's not a waste of my time.
