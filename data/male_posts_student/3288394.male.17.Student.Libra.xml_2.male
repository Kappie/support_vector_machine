I play at an intermediate/advanced level leaning towards intermediate.(my scale, not the Wizards') I currently have a White anti-artifact/control/assault deck, a Blue creature-denial deck, and a White/Black anti-creature/I've-got-creatures-and-you-don't deck. On Saturdays my friends and I are trying to get people to hang at his house and do Magic like a weekly thing. Yay for Magic. Chill, I'm out for now.
