Anyhow, just wanted to tell you that if you're still running Spybot 1.2, or nothing at all, it's time to download Spybot SD 1.3 for free  urlLink here   Don't be foolish like me, update right away! I was running my Spybot 1.2 and finding very little is any spyware, so I thought I was okay, but then I decided "What the hell, I'll download Spybot 1.3 and see if it helps alot more" and it did! Definitely! I found 52 entries of Spyware on my PC when I ran 1.3! that's 52 problems Spybot 1.2 couldn't find, even though I updated it frequently.      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
