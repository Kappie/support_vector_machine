Hopefully, his mom will never discover this site (although I don't think she'd be entirely shocked).  Mike is a powerful force in the world of talking: he does it a lot.  He also recently purchased a new pair of white shoes, which really do look good when he's wearing black and white, but which have the potential to go horribly wrong.  I've known Mike for a little over two years, and I've enjoyed every minute of it -- except for the times when I'm with him.  I love you, Mike.  You know, there are bugs in my house, and I really would like them to be gone.  I don't know what they want: there is no food in here.   This building is called The Four Ambassadors.  The realtor has found a studio apartment there for $850 -- it has a view of the water, and it's classified as a "PH", which I really hope means penthouse.  I doubt it'll be as good as The Mark, because that place was built in 2001 and this place was built in 1968.  I defy you to find anything that was built in 1968 that looks good.
