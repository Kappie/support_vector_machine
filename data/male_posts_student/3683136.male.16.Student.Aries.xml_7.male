What if I don't talk for 3 hours?" all of that stuff.  It's crazy.  I'm not sure I want to do this anymore.  In other news, hung out with Katie and Sarah this afternoon.  SNM has a boyfriend.  Interesting development.  Crazy development.  I'm always unhappy when other people are happy.  That's really not a good sign.  It probably means I really am cynical.  Which pisses me off.  Just like everything else.  I think I'm trapped in a "shame spiral."  Teehee.  I think I'll rent the first few episodes of Nip Tuck tonight.  I hope it's good.  Three cheers for escapism.  -Mike  "I thought I'd write, I thought I'd let you know. That the years since you've been gone I've finally let you go."
