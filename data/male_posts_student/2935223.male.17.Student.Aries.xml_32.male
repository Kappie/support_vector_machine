So....I talked to Tina for like two hours after school today....and I figured sum things out. 1.)Why I couldn't ask Keli out. 2.)I still like Tina. Too bad, the two are intertwined..... Tina said sumthin' along the lines of how she has thought about starting a relationship.......but it's not worth it or sumthin'.....this makes me kinda sad...but also kinda happy.  If I can convince her that it would be worth it to go out with me....I might be able to pull off happiness.  Too bad this might be very hard..... This also leaves behind the question of....what about Keli. Don't get me wrong....I like Keli a lot......a bunch in fact....but....it's not the same kind of feelings that I feel for Tina though.....and this makes me sad...because I don't want to be mean to Keli...but...I know that if I were to go out with her...my feelings for Tina would get in the way....THUS...making it a very wierd relationship.  I feel like shit.  I want Tina....but...I don't want to hurt Keli......but....I.....KJLSAJBNKOU!!! I've got to find a way out of this....I always do....I'm the planner....this is what I do.....I shoudl be able to do this....just....it'll take me a while. Peace Out!  Spense
