My Beliefs:                     "I believe we are born in order to experience the many feelings and ideas the world has to offer. Like the great friends who cradle me with love, and the not so great ones who taught me that the down times they threw at me could only be followed by ups once they were gone. I believe we all set our own purpose for life. Mine personally would be to achieve a state of complete happiness, if for at least one moment. We should all do good for the sake of keeping peace . . . why cause pain and chaos? We die because at one point or another . . . our hearts stop, either from old age or some other reason. This may not be the most spiritual way of looking at death, but I’m not quite that spiritual.   God to me is a force which according to Christianity, created Heaven and Earth. Her (that’s right, her) role is to watch over us and track our sins and good deeds so she can argue a good case for whether or not we get into Heaven. God to me is like one of those really strict but fair teachers that you dislike when you first meet them, but grow to appreciate over time. She gives me a sense of security, something we all should feel.   I believe we all have souls, otherwise it would make soul mates impossible. Your soul goes wherever it pleases after death if you find your soul mate. If you don’t find it your soul continues the search after death. It is my belief that one can not be judged alone. If you deserve to go to hell your punishment is to have that person erased from your memory, and to never be able to in them while you continue your search for them. Concerning angels, they are the people around you everyday who make your life a complete. They may also be known to some as friends and family. I won’t completely rule out the existence of ghosts. Just as I won’t automatically disagree that there is a Santa Claus. There are some things so strange that they might be real.   It may not have been too clear in the last paragraph, but I believe we all subconsciously search for our soul mates. It is a natural thing, we want to be happy, and love gives us that feeling of confusion, overwhelming grief, and happiness we can’t live without. Music is my guiding light; it speaks the feelings I can’t describe in a way that is pleasant and understandable. Art has a strange way of making us want to twist it and turn it until it holds meaning for us. A big orange circle may cry out emergency to one, while whispering relaxation to another. Of course, I hope no one is taking these things to heart. These are MY convictions, I am only expressing them, not persuading you to think and believe them.   I got to think a while ago about what I would someday want my wedding to be like. It should take place before God (anywhere basically). The people who take part are of course the couple and anyone the wish to observe the ceremony. I think the only one who would lead is the person marrying the two. Though the main focus is one the couple. What happens is that the two people exchange and share how they feel toward each other. It’s a time when you know exactly what you think but can never say it to come out as great as it feels in your heart. No objects or symbols are needed, though for some reason people like to use rings, I never quite understood that. I once heard that some people believe there is a nerve in your ring finger that leads directly to the heart. I like the ay that sounds so I’ll try the ring thing too.   It felt great to rite this essay. I discovered tat I am a bit of a romantic..... whoda thunk it! My favorite part was creating my symbol. The basic shape is that of a cross. Not necessarily because I am Christian. It will make more sense as I explain further. Stare into the horizontal part of my symbol. Notice how when you first look at it, it seems complete. Focus on the sides a bit more and you notice that it’s not quite complete. It still has room to be filled in. You can see two little spaces in the middle. One side is love, the other is hate. The love side is more open and easier to approach. The other is more intimidating and harder to get into. Both spaces can be either full, empty, or in between depending on my mood. Right now it is well balanced as seen by the top and bottom of my symbol. The middle an open and close depending on my mood, I feel a bit balanced in my mood between judgmental, disappointed, and happiness. The balance is imperfect and therefore neither are the yin-yang signs. The rounded cross-like figures at the top and bottom represent my emo (emotional) levels. The top means I am happy wit something because of something simple (sleep after a few nights of having to stay up late, a compliment from someone, things of that nature). The bottom is happiness due to love (for family, friends, etc.) The scale can be the same for an emotion; I just used happiness as an example. As for the lyrics, in paragraph five, I said music helps me say what I feel when I don’t know ho to say it. Those lyrics represent what I felt at the particular moment I thought of my symbol, not necessarily because of the symbol. I hope my symbol is thought of as not only a symbol, but art, and as such is represented differently by different people."    Believe it or not, that was nothing compared to the whole thing! I figured with the other stuff I'm gonna type it'll make this post a lot longer. Feel free to spit out any comments, disagreements, and remarks you have toward my work, I an stand a bit of contructive critisism. Or any objections regarding what some may concider blasphemous statments. No on to more of my verbal release.  Today in marine bio, me and aaron   On to another thing, i was thinkin about how some people like to find meaning in art, music in particular. I was shooting ou songs in my head and thinking of what they mean to me. I got "id do anything" by simple plan stuck in my head. Automatically I was thinkin about ave. Hees a few lyrics so you can have a better understanding of where im comin from:   Another day is going by. I'm thinkin about you all the time, but you're out there, and I'm here waitin. And I wrote this letter in my head cus so many things were left unsaid. but now you're gone and i can't think streight.......Id do anythin, just to hold you in my arms, to try to make you laugh cus somehow i can't put you in the past. Id do anything, just to fall asleep with you. will you remember me? cus I know I wont forget you."   as most of you know, she was forced to move to the middle of nowhere. I miss you sooooooo much! :( luv ya! :-D. wow, ive filtered a LOT, Id bettter save my wrists fo another day. L8R.
