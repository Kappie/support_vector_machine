I'm on page 411 in my book ( The Eye fo the World ). I still don't know if it's any good, but so far I'm at a good part, so I can't talk long. Also, I probably could have subtitled it TGIF ( T hank  G od  I t's  F riday). Next Tuesday will be the last day for school. We go in and get our report cards and that's it.  I'm still awaiting the day that somebody will look at this and comment, but that's as likely as pigs flying. I have no idea why I post anyway. It seems useless, but the more it seems useless and the more I think about no one ever reading this the more I want to write in it. It's amazing how stubborn I am at times, but I guess that's a good thing
