Of course, I'm stuck doing the menial work.  Heck, I'll probably even be the poor cabin boy that gets it from the first cannon fired, then the captain or whoever sobs over my shattered body whilst I speak, "I's ne'er got a chance to LIVE, cap'n!"   Or the sad fact is that maybe she actually DOES want me to be a pirate.  Oh well. Ninjas are cooler anyway.
