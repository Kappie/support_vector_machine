I don't really feel like this is a remotely interesting challenge.  So far, I've done everything to the best of my ability, and it's really ruining my summer.  I can barely see my friends, and when I do see them, there's always that unsettling feeling of problems and panic on the horizon.  I wish I could just ignore all this and have fun, but I'm slipping into massive procrastination.  It's not that I don't like to write, it's just that all my work is so monotonous.  Oh well...  I guess I don't have a choice...  Go america......  Grey Davis gives us problems and we give him work........
