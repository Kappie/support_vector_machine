He got married to Marsha Edmenson (Or however it's spelled), and that's cool and everything, but he asked me to film it for him, and I tried... and it might turn out okay, but I don't know.  I went to a rehersal dinner yesterday and felt awkward because I didn't know anyone.  Well, tonight was about as awkward, only, my family was there, so it was okay, because I just talked to Loren and Erin when I didn't know what to do.   The filming went okay, I guess, I felt odd, walking around, taping stuff while there was an official wedding going on and whatnot, but it was outside in the woods near a little beach thingy, so I guess it was a little unorthodox to start with.  Plus, most of the time, other than the obvious parents, pastor, and the to-be-married themself, I didn't really know who else they wanted me to capture on film, so I just kinda got everyone.  I figure Mike can just cut out whoever he wants from the video, so it's no skin off my nose.  Anyway, I'm getting behind in this blogging thing... and I don't really feel like working on it right now.  Exactly what I was afraid would happen.  So... I guess I'll catch up when I do.
