As a welcome to any new visitors -- and because I can't come up with anything new to post this afternoon -- I'm re-posting a song parody from back in the fall that I wrote and think is kind of cute.  [[to the tune of: "The Rainbow Connection"]]  "The Casebook Connection"  [HE sings] Why are there so many Cases in casebooks But never a case about love Cases are boring And poorly written But they're what our days are made of  We read all these holdings But I'd rather be holding You in my arms every night  I think we've found it The Casebook Connection You versus me turns out right  [SHE sings] I read these issues But cry in these tissues And wish that I had something more And though you're erratic In answers Socratic I love you more than I love the law  This feeling's not fiction In my jurisdiction You keep my soul burning bright  I think we've found it The Casebook Connection You versus me turns out right  [BOTH] Nothing's preventing Our heads from dissenting But somehow we both feel this way Our hearts are both beating Our minds have a meeting We sign our love contract today  Show me your objective manifestation Of subjective intent -- with a kiss  I think we've found it The Casebook Connection Legally binding... like this...  [THEY KISS.]
