It was fun at Hooters 'cause a bunch of Irish bagpipers marched through to advertise a big Guinness toast later that evening. We didn't stick around for the toast, because we had already been there a while... but it was fun nonetheless.  Laziness ensues, despite going to bed earlier! I've installed Gabriel Knight 3... so far it doesn't have the same flair GK1 had. We'll see how it goes.  ***
