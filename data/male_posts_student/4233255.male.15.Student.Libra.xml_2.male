William Daunte Zenoni, 17, lost control of his car on a curve on Glen Errol Road at about 12:30 Saturday morning. The car hit a mailbox and a metal sign before bursting into flames.  “There was a guy trying to pull out a guy that was stuck, so we ran up to the house across the street to try to get some water, but the house didn’t reach,” said witness Charles Ellis. “Then we filled a trash can and dumped it on the kid, but by that time it looked like it was hopless.”  Zenoni died at the scene. Passenger Emily Wyatt, 14, was airlifted to Grady Memorial Hospital where she later died. The car’s other passenger, Neil Patel, 15, was transported to Atlanta Medical center and was listed in critical condition Saturday evening."
