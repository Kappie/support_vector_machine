I think i would have a lot of fun traveling around and eating with her.  And her 30 minute meals are very cool too.  It's like i'm in her kitchen and she's talking to me, unlike some tv chefs who are all pretentious and snooty.  Plus she's adorable.  and she's got an enormous mouth that looks like it should be on someone much bigger.  I don't know why that's a selling point either, but it is.
