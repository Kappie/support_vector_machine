Ive talked to a few friends of mine they've got it all figured out...tatoo artist, journalist, U.S ambassador to France, you can name the lot. They've got their career, where they want to live, and what college they hope to attend all planned, and with the wealth of some of the kids I know, their plans are definitly set in stone and will most likely be carried out. But what lies ahead for me? I don't know what profession I seek, where I want to live, or if I even want to fill out this so called "American Dream" of getting a job, living in suburbia, picket fence and a wife. So I'm going to work on my life day by day, and post some blogs along the way (hows that rhyme right there). But I'm resolving that these blogs will not be summaries of my day, but more of summaries of my thoughts. And so begins the blogging of Matt...
