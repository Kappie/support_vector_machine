It was quite possibly one of the least productive days for how many hours I was there, but at least I learned something and earned hours. I learned that neuro-imaging was a massive pain in the ass back in the day where everything needed to be done by hand, before the days of programs that automatically aligned the brains to a space, before programs that automatically generated a native mask, and before the days of programs that made no-cerebellum masks for you. I'm so glad I wasn't doing this back in those days. I almost exploded after trying to align a brain to the atlas. Cries.  Moving on, after work I realized I didn't have any money and that I was kinda stuck in UCLA until I could get a ride out. After waiting for a few minutes, I called my uncles (Babak for work, and then Bahador for fun) and Bahador answered after I didn't reach Babak. I talked to him for a bit over the phone and explained how I didn't have any money and so he offered to pick me up and I graciously ( :-P ) took it. We went to Fantastic Sam's to get him a haircut. The one we went to is in one of the standard issue plazas that litter the Los Angeles CityScape. On just about every corner, there's one of these little plazas with a little parking lot with anywhere from 5 to ~18 stores. They're not very pretty or very much fun to walk around, but seeing how I didn't have much else to do other than wait in Fantastic Sam's, I walked around and walked into each of the little shops and asked the owners questions. They weren't bad questions or anything, I was just asking about what they did or about items on their menu or the history of their place. In the process I found out that the dude who either works at or owns "Hong Kong Chinese Food" is an ass and that if you're ever in Los Angeles (or Lost Angels as I like to call it) to not eat there because he's a jerk. Not that this paragraph has any sharp point in particular, but here's the point I was meaning to make...  While I was walking between the stores of the plaza, it was incredibly quiet. Lost Angels is not usually quite... ever. Especially not at like 6 or 7 in the evening. It just felt very surreal. I kinda liked it and I kinda didn't. I was kinda hoping that some persian jerk (I'm persian so I get to make fun of them. Don't PMS (it's a verb now) me out.) would speed by in his nice, new, fancy, black, loaded Beemer with some persian dance music blaring, only half paying attention to the road because the rest of his attention is going to how his new Armani shades look and go with his overly-gelled hair and how all the ladies are reacting and thinking that he's all hot. What a dork. -- Eehh, I went off on a tangent. Now back on track, I was also half-hoping that no cars would come so that I could continue to feel this extremely uncomfortable, yet comfortable feeling. It was just weird.  Oh, I also realized that I can't read or watch or listen to the news anymore because I realized today that it's all so disgustingly inaccurate in favor of current American policies and not the real american principals, or even (and god forbid this ever happen) the facts. It makes me sad.  After we got his haircut, we went over to his place where we just hung out as he played the keyboards and we listened to Float On and talked. We also saw Spider-Man 2 tonight. I had a really good time, not because the movie was amazing though. I mean, it was pretty good, but the physics was, as you could expect, extremely unrealistic and there were a few extremely cheesy lines. Anyway, what really made it great was these 5 black girls behind us who kept making hilarious  commentary on every part and cracking jokes about various cheesy lines and rhetorical questions. There was also this one girl who, judging by the pitch of her voice, was like 4 who screamed "STOP IT!!" for all to hear at this one messy* kissing scene. Upon hearing this, the entire theater busted up laughing uncontrollably for like 3 minutes. Oh, and my uncle was also pointing out pointless, but funny details about stuff in the background. Like there was this one part where the evil dude throws a car, and my uncle, being the car-rental owner, car salesman, and auto-body shop owner, noticed that it was a brand new Ford Focus that was thrown and started stating prices for the amount of body damage that was done. It was just funny and it was a really good time.  Hmmm... let's see... I think that just about covers the day... Yep.  That is all. -- Feanor  * The kind that's only in movies and stuff. I mean, no one REALLY kisses like that. If they did, their faces would be all wet and would need a towel to dry off. I shudder to think about what their sex would be like if their daily, public kissing was that long and wet and messy. >_
