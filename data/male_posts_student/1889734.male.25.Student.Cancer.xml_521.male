I'd like to see that one go on.  Mostly because I detest Basketball with the same passion I feel towards Hillary.  So let's have at it.  How can you defend such a pathetic 'sport'?  Basketball is all about the individual.  The team exists only to help the superstar get a bigger contract and attract more 'ho's.  FOrget the rules, forget travelling, forget the concept of a foul BY the money player (but he is ALWAYS fouled by the lesser player).  Forget even having a competition.  Like the Shaq inauguration in LA when they 'won' the title.  It's a mere formality.  The universe as a whole would be better off without basketball.  Give me baseball any day as an alternative.    Or Irish Hurling!  There's a man's sport.
