In grade ten I gave out questionnaires to see how people percieved me. They ranged from simple impersonal questions to moderately personal. However its not the answers to the questions which show how i've changed but the actual questionnaire (and the incoherant english used in my wording of some of the questions). Back then i was completely agaisnt censoring my thoughts and.. I left before finishing the post and now have been overtaken by a feeling of tired so this sentence is not complete.
