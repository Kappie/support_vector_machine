The main reason i hate boxing day is because if you have a legitimate reason to go out and buy something everyone is out buying a whole bunch of crap! take todays boxing day for example, i was dragged out shopping by my mom because apperently she needed help. we went into the local (well not really local it's a 15 minute drive) Wal-mart and there were old people everywhere! If you've read some of my other blogs you'll understand that i don't like old people, and i hate the average wal-mart customer even more. they seem to not grasp that a shopping cart and a narrow aisle don't mix, especially if there's another person coming the other way and there's no room to pass, and yelling at each other seems to make a difference to them. and weeeeeeeeeeeeee! two cents off chrismas tuna! lets all crowd around because it'll never be that cheap again. and people! learn to freaking put stuff back on the shelf!!! it's not that hard. Damned holiday season! i hate it! don't get me wrong though...i love christmas, i just hate the season and the people. -Matt
