Either they are a little daft and think they can actually get it done, despite not having any significant manned flight experience, and despite their internal politics that should tear the EU apart in a generation, and despite the squabble over who will get what contracts and what nationality will supply the astronauts.  Or, they think we are somewhat serious and they really want to be invited to the mission.  If they put up some money and begin work, I think they believe we will ask them in.  I personally don't want them involved.  The Russians have a legitimate reason because of thier expertiese and experience, but the EU?  Why drag them along?
