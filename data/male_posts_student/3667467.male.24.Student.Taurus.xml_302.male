Then they became organic again. What remains is half a jar of mustard, half a dozen eggs and some sticks of mustard. I learned a lot, mostly that there are plenty of colors not in the rainbow that still occur in nature.  pop-ups blocked by my google toolbar (downloaded in January): 998   Edited by: TomServo0   at: 3/30/04 1:55 am
