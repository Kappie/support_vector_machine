I get very good grades (average of 3.25, where 4=100%) in FEU FERN, and didn't do so bad at TUP,  T he  U ltimate  P akshiet!  Well, somehow, I get myself in to too much slacking, after all the imminent "4"s that I will be receiving this trimester.  Okay, let's see... in Literature, I don't think I have more than four correct answers on the final exam, which is 50% of the final grade.  And if my professor wants it, she could get me suspended for working on my classmate's final project in a programming subject.  Shite.  What can you do, if you are a natural slacker but also a natural student?  What?  Well, of course, be both!  Look where it's going to bring me...  Hell, I suppose.  So anyway, as a student, the important thing is, you study well, and you study what you want.  That's the point of choosing what course you're going into, so you would be willing to get into the groove... baby.  C'mon, if one likes what he/she's learning, how could you not allow to put the challenge of examinations and projects in your way?  How, I say?  If you love something, and you feel the ease of it, why not get inside it more?  Wait... that sounded perverse.  My point is, education is cool, and despite the fact that it is not a competition of grades, taking (and perfecting) exams should not be a chore, but a simple challenge or game, on your favorite  sport .  Cheers!  If I sounded  mahangin  about my grades, I'm just too damn proud of it.  Because, it is kinda weird.  When you don't put much effort and you get good, it's like you have too much luck. And, the paranormal thing about it is that, where did that too much good luck came from?  And when does it get pawned from me?  *shivers*
