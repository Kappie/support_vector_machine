I hope more of you are able to participate next year...it gives you a new appreciation and insight on what's important in life.  All of your posts are interesting and insightful and Rob your section on GM was well thought out but I do want to challenge you on the day after pill...I THINK (I have not researched it.) you can take the pill up to three days after you have had sexual intercourse...and if your egg is fertilized it would terminate the pregnancy which would be an abortion.  There is also the pill you can take several weeks after pregnancy that many abortion clinics are offering to their patients.  I am not sure how these pills sit with Pro-Lifers.    I will see you Monday...I am going to try and rent Fog of War today and prepare something for class next week.  Clark
