If you're betting beyond your limit, determined to get back what you lost,  sooner or later go back to get what they owe you, then it's a bad habit. If you bring $40  have the discipline to quit when that amount is lost, then it's not a bad habit, just a poor way to spend $40. If drinking interferes with areas of your life outside of the drinking environment, like sleeping in, getting out of shape, or spending too much, then it also is a bad habit. If it doesn't, then just keep it in moderation. Same with smoking. Bad habits aren't necessarily bad, depending on the amount of control exerted over the situation.
