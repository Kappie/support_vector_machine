And isn't the current vote in the senate on the gay marriage and pretty much their deal, not Bush's? Also, it's not just a religious ideology - it's a moral ideology that some people hold independent of religion. Granted, not everyone holds that moral position - but quite a few do.  It's a silly argument, but one that deserves an honest answer. If you think gay marriage should be allowed, what about polygamy or bigamy? The same moral objections that hold for outlawing gay marriage can also be brought to bear on those two moral positions. They are currently outlawed as well.  I do not advocate any of them. Marriage is between a man and a woman. Yes, my decision is religiously and morally based. I cannot and will not deny that, it is who I am.  The Jared bashing may now commence.
