Let me first start by not telling you how I've spent my last few days, but rather, just interesting events in my past, and plans for the future.  Well one interesting experience in the past that I can pretty much only think of right now, is how when I was visiting my friend titled "Yo Quiero Smut" up in the north, we saw some pretty strange things.  "Yo Quiero Smut" (YQS) and myself were driving around town when we saw an open field, with two policemen in uniform relaxing and playing frisbee.  Now, that was a little strange if you ask me, but YQS and myself just shrugged it off.  We soon encountered railroad tracks laid out behind trees on the side of the road, and an African-American family sadly walking on it (faces downward), mother, father, son, daughter, and all.  Finally, we visited the local Kohl's for no specific reason, and YQS and myself were surprised to see manakins sitting on wheelchairs used to display their clothes.  Now sure, maybe they wanted to diversfy their manakins by making sure they don't all look the same.. But on a wheelchair! what's that all about?  Anywho, enough of that.  I'm pretty much done here, I'm going to do some secretive things.  But before I go, let me just list some words that describe my interests:  crows, cats, ninjas, owls, sharks, manitees, orcas, tom cruise in the last samurai, philosophy, mimes, daniel day lewis, people with the middle name "rose", arnold schwartzenegger, the wb 11 morning news, ford taurai, yahoo pool, bubble trouble, rap, gameboy advanced sp, warmth, crows, samurais, lingo, the accelerator, roller coasters, spiderman at sharper image...  Alright, I'm out: please do not negatively criticize my hair, I'm getting it cut Tuesday, but not short.
