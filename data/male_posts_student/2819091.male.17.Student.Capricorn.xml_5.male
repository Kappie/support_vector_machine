As all of you Gambit fans or comic book readers know, some of Monsieur LeBeau's past are still unrevealed.  Some memories did surface, which caused him and others close to him like Rogue, for example, to suffer.  His involvement in the Morlock Massacre and the death of another woman he loved because of Sabretooth...  Those memories haunted him, nearly killing him.  Those were painful memories that he bore...  Death, murder, suffering, pain, hate, love, indifference...  Anyway...  My point is that we all had painful memories.  My memories might not be as worse as yours but it did hurt...  That's why I wanted to use this picture...  I wanted a picture that signified that I had painful memories like Gambit, not exactly in his caliber, but to me it was torture.  That's why I wanted to use this picture and believe that some memories,even ones that might seem small, hurt.  I hope that you will understand the concept that I'm talking about and myself for thinking this way, no matter how idiotic or pathetic my way of thinking is.
