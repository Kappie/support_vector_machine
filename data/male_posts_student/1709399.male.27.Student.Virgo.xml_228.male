My grandfather has slightly recovered from his Serious condition but still in sedation.                                Nice to be in Chennai though I have come here on a urgent visit. As usual Teddy,my dog was very Happy to see me again. Would be here in Chennai for the next few days and would be going back to Delhi on Tuesday.
