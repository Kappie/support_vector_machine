If you don't know who Heaton is by now, he's this friend of mine who's really tall and moved here from England a year ago but only for 3 years, he originally lived in Sachem area...anyways Heaton takes things too seriously. He goes crazy calling me a psycho because of my previous blogger. Well guess what, my previous blogger is true, I AM A PSYCHO! Anyways, enough of that. In the past couple of school days weird things happened. On Tuesday or Wednesday, I forget, the band got in trouble when a sub (Mr. Paster aka Mr. Potter) that has no intelligence of music, egged us on to play crazy stuff and the next day half the band gets 3 days of detention, plus we had to write an apology letter to Mrs. Kalabza and Mr. Paster, why Mr. Paster? I have no clue, he deserves shit so Paul typed his and copied one for me and I wrote mine to Mrs. Kalabza's. Alot of people typed it, which most kids don't know is very disrespectful, so I wrote it, a page long and very sincere. Thank god the next day she decided to be kick ass awesome and slim it down to 2 days of detention so I didn't have detention on Friday (yesterday). Also, on Wednesday on the after school bus Jason C and this other kid Jamie made fun of the gay kids and Jamie pissed in a bottle. Paul and I were dying of laughter, everyone was dying. I think we were bombed with laughing gas. Anyways the gay people were like YO YOU DONT KNOW WHAT SHIT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH IN THE PAST HOUR. Bullshit, they're "shit" is an illusion. They supress it upon themselves. I saw gay guys kiss, that made Paul and I scarred for life. Yesterday, I can't remember what happened. Oh yea! Heaton kicked me down the G stairs and it was fun, and Chris Michaelis came over and we did stuff. Highlights of the day. Today nothing happened, I spent the day alone. Which brings me to my conclusion. My life is getting darker, smaller, compact into a ball I can't break out of, it's becoming more lonely. The sad part is I've inflicted this pain upon myself by certain thoughts, you know the thoughts. I talk about it so much, there's no way you can't figure out what I'm talking about. I can't stop thinking, is it just a fake movie.
