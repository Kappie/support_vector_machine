John said my last post (before the survey) was not good, not bad.  I don't know what to do to better it.  These days, I've only been writing events and issues I think about.  I guess if the issues themselves aren't juicy, the blog won't be.  There have been few homework assignments, but multiple big things, like the chemistry project and the history year-long thing.  So the result is that I'm both bored and anxious at the same time.  It's annoying how little happens as regards the plan during the week, and stops completely over the weekend.  If only I could call, this would be so much easier, but it doesn't work like that apparently.  Yesterday I gained my first new buddy in a long time, Jing.  Welcome to the buddy list.  As you can confirm by the last post, nothing is going on.
