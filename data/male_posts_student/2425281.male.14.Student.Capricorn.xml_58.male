LoLz. i've posted results up on my website but yeah. as everyone should have guessed our team NSB B lost. surprisingly, it wasn't by much. we should have won the first round if it wasn't because of the adjudicator, we won the second and only just lost the third round to scots (it was my fault because i hadn't gotten used to the 1st speaker yet, and i hated the topic). We weren't really provided enough food...but yeah. I met di yu - haven't seen her in ages. she goes to PLC now. and they got into the finals! they were versing scots college b and lost. i do not agree with the result, because clearly they had a much better case and better speakers. dude... scots ppl talk so slowly  and still get really short times! >.   australs   --- i learnt a lot though. mac uni are like uts try hards LoLz, they had a fatter version of felicity, they got katie from uts to adjudicate. haha...but they lacked the technology of UTS ^___^    i was  really tired  afterwards, i had  woken up at 5  in the morning to prepare for the days debates and i went to sleep at 9:30. woke up at like 10 this morning LMAO   and ppl kept ringing me during debates *glares at jeff, mabel and tash* so yes...i have nothing more to say. my nickname tells all.
