For example, last night, my roommate got a call from some of the girls on our floor in the dorms, and they were bored and wanted to chit-chat.  Ok, that's cool, but when I got there, I was totally disghusted.  Some of the girls were talking about how much they wanted to get layed and so on and so forth.  As soon as that nonsense came up, I just got up and left.  They claimed that it was their New York attitude, however, I have to totally disagree with that.  Anyhow, that was that.  Today was pretty good though.  My Chemistry mark was bumped up a couple of marks, and I aced my medical terminology exam :)  School was somewhat alright, though, our internet access back at the dorms may be on wait. Apparently, the Internet company lost my friends' order!!!  Talk about inefficiency!!  I'm waiting for him to get back in the dorms to see if we can figure this out.     That, however, leads to my next concern.  There are quite a few leechers around here.  I really don't want random people (who I don't really trust) coming into my room every so often.  It will seriously annoy the heck out of me.  This internet issue may, however, be remedied for subsequent semesters.  I was asked to estimate the costs of setting up wireless internet in the dorms, so that all incoming students would have access when they arrive instead of waiting 2-3 weeks (or more) to simply get a DSL connection.  Definition of the day: NSAID - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug - drug that reduces inflammation but is not a steroid; examples include aspirin and ibuprofin and other inhibitors of prostaglandins, naturally produced substances that promote inflammation.  Ok, that's all for now!  PS: JL, I miss ya!! :(
