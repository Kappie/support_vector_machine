Got a sick-ass job as a statistician for the Candian Football League (CFL). They pay me $50 a game to type on a computer. And I get free food and free reign of the press-box. Its awesome I get all the media guides I want, and I get to watch the football game from a dry and warm box.  2. Went to summer school. What shit that was. I took grade 12 U english to fast-track. My teacher was a guy but had a higher pitched voice than a woman's shriek. It was soooo fucking wierd. The guy was so naive to, people were gone for half the day and he didn't do shit about it. He also left the exam in the classroom while he left. But then some dumb-ass got caught looking at it, and he re-wrote it. I got an 84% in that course. That's better than if I took it in real school, because apparently the teacher I was supposed to have thinks that 70% is an extremely good mark in her class. What a nutjob.  3. Had some experience with the term. "flaming cunt" [ don't ask ]  4. Went to a basketball referees camp. It was great, I drank soo much beer. I loved it, it combined the things I love, reffereeing, booze and a few hot women. Good times.  5. House-sitting, I get to stay at a relative's house while they're out of the country, great fucking times. I should have a party before they come back.  I think that's it. I know that next week I'm off to another basketball official's camp, and then hopefully a road trip down to the US to do some cheap shopping.  I'm also looking for a girlfriend, so any single females around age 17-18 in southern ontario who are interested and are somewhat compatible with me drop me a line.  Thanks.  Anyways until next time, "Internet world, go fuck yourself"  C Ya
