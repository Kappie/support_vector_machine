Friday   I was bored of mIRC 5.91 full so i switched for X-Chat (It was recommenced by iJeff a few weeks ago). Works like a charm.There is those custom server buttons for quick access, i love it way more that that piece of junk mIRC is.   Saturday   Speaked with Euphemie, a friend from Canada. A really cool girl, i wish she could connect more often! At night i was with paulo Pimentel and Gabriel Drummond, we took the bus to Guara and eated at McDonald. 2 trios and a stomac pain after, i was home. The dog escaped the house, we searched for him all nigh long...   Sunday  Speaked a bit with my cousin on Skype ( http://www.skype.com/ ) and with my girlfriend over Msn. I also had such a cool surprise. Mayra finally connected on msn. I was really happy,she is so cool. A cute face,also! I had the idea of starting that blog after watching her blog.  No news as for when i'm going to start paying to play on Ragnarok Online...should be soon enough.  Regards,  Zephyr
