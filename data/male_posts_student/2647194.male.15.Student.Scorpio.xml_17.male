I see a trend coming on... Daily Recap: Math: Yet another warning to never slack off in pre-calculus. It won't do you any good. Chapter 7 is a bitch, and of course we have a test next week on Thursday on it. Wahoo Science: I'm almost amazed that the whole test was 50 points of pure multiple choice. Seemed almost too easy... Band: The whole band setup has been flipped into another universe. In other words, the percussion section was moved to the other side of the room in order to accomidate risers for the choir (grrrr). Now it's even more cramped back there.             *Anouncement: The Nobel Peace Prize festival is tommorow. The Random, choir, and orchestra will be attending.* Spanish: Gee, that test was either than I thought...(::cough cheat cough::).  Random Spanish Funny of the day: They just don't give up, do they? Pat and Anton continued to try to hit on me for some reason. Whatever it is, it's kinda disturbing...  English: HAHAHAHA to all that have to take the test tommorow! Thank (insert higher being here) for that festival... Social: I really do wonder if Nathaniel has ever pulled off the "stack of random papers and one has the answers on it" method of cheating on a social test.  Day by day I ask myself more often, "Why don't the other candidates drop out? I mean, Kerry's got it." It's not doing Dean any good attacking Kerry, whereas Kerry is relentlessly going after Bush's extremely abundant flaws. Seems to be working quite nicely. Keepin' the pressure on is the best way.  Random Bush fact: President Bush has had the fewest press conferences of every President. Want to know why? Because at his first press conferences he royally screwed up. Why don't people notice?  Another Random Bush fact: President Bush also refuses to acknowledge the lady's existence, who, I cannot recall the name of, but has  always  been asked for the very first question in  any  presidential press conference. In fact, he had her put in the back of the room, and won't acknowledge her after he did in his first press conference. Want to know why? Because she asked him a tough question which a president  should  be able to answer. Not Bush though, because he's a swaggerin' braggerin' Texas idiot for a president. Bush is going to have his ass handed to him on a gold platter in the debates, no doubt.
