This school was not what most people would consider as a real school.    This university advertised itself as a school for working professionals to continue to work on their education.    Therefore, I get there and start talking to the admissions person about the program and what it entails.    I find out that just like every other psychology doctorate program it requires a 2-year practicum and a 1-year internship.    Ok so that isnâ€™t too bad, until I find out that I would have to give up whatever job I was working in so to work full time in the practicum/internship unpaid for, three years.      THREE YEARS...No money, no moolah, no cash flow, no income......gee...no food?  How is anyone supposed to work for three years with out being paid?    Now do not get me wrong but no one is going to go into the mental health field and make tons of money.    However, I already have student loans, why would I want to get more student loans.    When will I ever pay them back?    I do not get why practicum/internship students are not paid we are providing a service just as valuable as a mental health practitioner that is out in the field.  I understand that we are still learning, but how are people going to become psychologists if they can support themselves.      Ok so that is my bitch about not being happy about the Dr. situation.    Now for the reason why I am complaining so much.    Since the eighth grade, I have been working towards being a psychologist.    I have heard and been reinforced from my folks, friends, and acquaintances to be a psychologist.    Now I am currently graduating in December with my Masters in Counseling, in     Texas     that will allow me to do the exact same work as a psychologist.    Therefore, what the issue is is that I feel like I am not living up to what I have dreamed about for a long time.    Kind of like a weird sorta of failure to myself.    I think overall I have made the decision to not pursue my doctorate for a while, because I am tired of being broke and living hand to mouth all the time.  I am ready to be an adult and enjoy being independent financially.    All right, time to be done posting.    :)
