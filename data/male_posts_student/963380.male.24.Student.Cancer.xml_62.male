I was "late" in that I thought I was supposed to be in at 8:30 when in actuality (love that word) my start time was 9:00. So it's meh-tacular.  Did some exercising last night - I actually own exercise videos. Strange thing, I woke up refreshed. I guess it's true, I'm really not getting enough exercise.  Meh, Tyson's doing the security audit. We have a screen saver that makes people pee.  Mike in software decided to be a bit of a pain this morning. He was just standing in software watching Lilo  Stitch so I asked him to go and straighten up some of the titles on their shelves. Instead of giving me some sort of concilliatory answer - which will usually get anyone off your back here - he decided to challenge it. Dude's got a chip on his shoulder about the size of Rhode Island.  urlLink Moodybitch (tm).
