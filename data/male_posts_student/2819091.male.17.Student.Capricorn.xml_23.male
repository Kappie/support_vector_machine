This sadness I feel Is so difficult to deal. The feeling is so real That I could not find the time to heal.  Please come back to me, Don't leave me be In this present state. Please don't make me wait... Forever causes me to become irate, I'm sorry for the impatience, But the distance between us is tearing me apart.
