It has also been said in the latest time that Munich will delay their move to Linux until the Software Patent issue has been solved out. I and many of my friends think the Software Patents are a very bad thing for the Open Source Society, if a company with tons of money could buy all ideas within software development all smaller companies would die obscures. Just look at Microsoft patents, they have patents for mouse clicks, transparency, apple trees and tons of others. You cant have patents on such things, EU VOTE NO TO PATENTS.  I must write again that I thinks that Novell is doing the right thing in its Linux aiming, they will merge Ximian and SuSE, I think that will be a killer Desktop Distro ;) SuSE is good already(Thinking of desktop use), Ximian gnome is good(Again just thinking of desktop use) and Novell also tries to merge the best from both KDE and GNOME into a new standarized product, that'll be very nice :)  NB: Please tell if you find any spelling errors, i'm struggling a bit with the spellchecker, it's replacing things if just scroll a bit to much.
