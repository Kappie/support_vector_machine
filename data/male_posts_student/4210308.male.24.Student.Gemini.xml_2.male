The Pinoys....   the reason I decided to go out with these guys is because...   they gamble...   the very first time I went bowling with em...   I came up 65 bucks...   today, I lost 10!...   ain't that bout a beeyatch!...      bowling with these dudes...   sort of enlightened me...   I mean I don't speak any kind of Tagalog...   don't even understand it...   it was just trippin me out...   back in high school...   I woulda never kicked it with these fools...   you know,   the FOB stereotype...   I mean they ain't hard core TRU pinoys...   they're hip wid' it...   up to date...   so to speak...   people are just people...   that's the difference between me and you...      but anyhow...   tomorrow/today...   we get to rock Jerseys to work...   usually it's a collared shirt...   some stupid 2% promotion...   I hate when my co-workers do that part of the job...   they are sales people so to speak...   and I hate em!...   I think I'ma rock my Vick (Mike) Virginia Tech...   just cuz I got shoes to match...   Premium Trainer 1's...   I would like to...   Keep It Real...   and rock a Giants/9ers/Warriors jersey...   but the Giants one I got is like 10 years old...   in Ratty condition...   don't got a 9ers one...   got two J Rich Rewinds...   but their too...   the 'norm'...   Like Cheers...   never watched the show...   that's the difference between me and you...   eh, Vick it is!...   It's not what you rock...   It's how you Rock it!...   Ha!...   Peace out...   Pimpin'...
