I say if me and Kellie never got into this fight, then we would still be together... but it did happen, and I can't change that. Right now I have a second chance to get a great friendship back. I'm going to take it. Everything else will just happen. Sorry about the last entry, I was very confused and frustrated that night. So, take care everyone.  That is all.
