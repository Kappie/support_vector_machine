This whole even started with a call from Dad during Physics lecture. I knew something went terribly wrong with Grandmother (MaMa, for short), because Dad would never call unless it was an emergency. I began to get tensed up, lost my concentration.   When I called my father, he confirmed my worst fear. She passed away. Oh my lord...she didn't even get the chance to meet us. She has been wanting to meet me and my brother...   I began to sign out. That admin idiot said something along the lines of "did you tell your parents school is more important?" HELLO! School more important than my grandmother? Fuck you! Anyway, she gave me the form in the end. I have to wait til 1 to get Mr Tham's signature to sign out. He agreed immediately when he heard that my grandmother passed away. What a good teacher!   Yeah. Parents were there le. We went to Grandma's place la. It was full of other relatives. MaMa...she looked so frail... I just said I've come to see her...everyone was sad.   We were waiting for the coroner to pronounce her death. He came, and he concluded that she died due to hypertensive heart attack. Oh my... Funeral arrangements were quickly made. Here's the lowdown. We are holding the funeral till Sunday morning 9.30, when her body leaves for the crematorium. Yeah.   Everyone was crying. Okay. Not everyone. Dai Gu Ma and Dai Pak Pak cried the loudest, and sadest too. They keep mentioning that mu brother and I have came to see her (she wants to see us ma)...and like neglecting the other cousins like that. I kinda felt guilty. Yeh...I was like just stoning...dunnoe what to react. Or how.   We went out to eat lunch at Whampoa. Oh god! My hunger was killing me!! I ate fantasic duck rice. How meowful! I got a stomachache due to over-eating, but oh well.   When we went back, MaMa's body was taken to some parlour to beautify. Yeah. We stayed around waiting for the funeral tent to be set up. Sigh.. Lets skip the boring hours till the tent was set up.  Okay...Her body arrived at 6+. It was really decorated nicely with a pearl in her mouth. I have to wear the white t-shirt. Zhang shun ma. It looks like only me, my brother and Fei Chui were the only children of MaMa's sons. We get the black cloth thingy to paste on our sleeves. The rest of the cousins are blue.   Anyway, there were rites. Yeah. Very long ones. Sigh. I don't even know what we were supposed to do half of the time. Anyway, after the rites, we milled around lor. I helped fold some yingbo (incense?).   Ya know, I am only open to two cousins. Fei Chui and Ah Ling. The rest ma, I don't talk to them de lor. HaHa!   We went home at 7.30+. We first went to eat at AMK Central, chicken rice. Then we went home. The rest, they say, is history. Tomorrow we are going back in the afternoon. Yeah. No school for me for tomorrow and Sat. I get to wake up REAL late! YaY!  YAY!! Fantasia and Diana are in the Top 2!! I am so happy!!  Okay. I go off le. See ya next time. TaTa. Night blog!
