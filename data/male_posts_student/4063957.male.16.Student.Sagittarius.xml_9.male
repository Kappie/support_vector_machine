I'm now an 'official' CSM. awesome. i'm glad to get out of electronics, it started becoming a hell-hole to be 100% honest. it was so 'oh ok i'll do that' but it never gets done. ah, oh well, it's no longer my worry! well, it was an interesting day. it was probably the one day i accuatly worked hard enough to earn my money. after removing all the movies from the "summer sale blowout" bins and organizing them by their own companies (Fox, MGM, Warner Brothers, etc.) then boxing them and putting them to claims. I did that all day. looked on the side of dvd's and vhs's to find out who made the, and put them in their appropiate spot. for 8 hours. 8 hours. not 1, not 2, not 7, 8! oh well. atleast CSMing is something new everyday and everyminute, which will be a nice switch. well, the one funny story that happened at work was this:  Some guy and his family came in and he asked if we had little speakers. i hesitated.  little speakers? what the hell is that  i asked my self. i presumed he meant computer speakers so showing him the speakers he said "those are nice little speakers". i chuckled, i was accutually right. well, he asked if they'd connect to a discman, and i said yes, i knew that for a fact (unlike everything else i b.s.) from previous basketball trips. he then got all complainy and asked why i had an attitude. he was like 'i know your lying to me' and then he left. usually, stuff like this you ask yourself why your doing this. then you remember it's your break, and you forget about it. and now i'm writing this out and asking myself wtf was he talking about. oh well. and on a lighter note, i saw mr. wilson aka the customer who looks like mr. wilson. i saw him driving. a nice gray GMC astro van. i guess he wasn't driving his '55 chevy. meh oh well. lies die quick.  jared "100% pure CSM" euverman   listening to : "Everybody" by Stablio (best song ever)  feeling : excited....nah who am i kidding i'm bored.  quote of the day :  "I know your lying to me"  - an angry customer
