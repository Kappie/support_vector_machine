Before that, however, I am considering a trip down to Charleston or elsewhere for a few days.  Would anyone else be interested in either going there for a couple of days or maybe meeting up somewhere else during that time?  Now I'm off to go get some custard at Scooter's or whatever on Belmont.  Thanks again for getting this going, Speegs.
