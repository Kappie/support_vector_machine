"Should Mynex reach efficient levels, their high-volume production of microanalyzers will offset tariff and transportation costs and place Sysmet in a competitive position against local producers and distributors," Brinker said to a vacationing English speaker from Boise, ID who shrugged apologetically. "A 25 percent growth rate is the motivation for manufacturing in the NICs." Brinker was later seen blinking uncomprehendingly at a bus-stop sign while awaiting his company limousine.
