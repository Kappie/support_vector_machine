Once home, I still need to do research on the net till ‘early’ morning. And worse of all, I felt asleep right after the first comical break in between “Hai You Ming Tian 2”, which happens to be the last episode. Stupid, stupid,stupid, I’ve watch every one episode from the every beginning, but I had to miss the last one. Stupid me, stupid tiredness, stupid rushy project. Work, work, work… there’s goes the rest of the week. Friday however, I manage to catch a six hours afternoon nap (2:30pm-8:30pm). Six full hours, I guess I was just too tired. Anyway, Lao Er returned soon after I woke up with lots of stuff. There were roses, candies, jelly, chocolate and plastic wrapper. Amused, I stood by and watched. Next, I was given the job to cut the wrappers in pieces and ribbons. Lao Er didn’t tell me how many short ribbons to cut so I went on and on until I asked her “can I stop?” Funny? I don’t know, but everyone laughed.    Back to work, I was just wrecking my mind just to find nice words and phrases to explain my findings and analysis. Took me quite some time to re-read, correct and add on some more sketches. It was around 4am, when I went to bed. Bright and early later that day, Lao Er and I took the same train. She was going to work with a bag of roses, and I was going to school to pass my work to my group mates. Seeing her with so many roses, I can’t help but laugh (I’ve no idea why). We went out separate ways at Outram park station.    I was too early, so I seated at a study area and trying to beat my own timing for a game (sega rally n gage) before one of my brother (Cher Hao) finds out and tries to make a spot in the chart. He came along and took Baby T from my hands, and he played with my car settings and made it in the chart. We met up with two more brothers (Shawn  Dan) before making our way down to DE’s faculty. I left Baby T with Cher Hao and met up with my group mates. We were able to hand in out work much much ealier, but because all the members in the group should be present for submission, we ended up being the last few because of a late member. I was worried at first, but our work was in on time, so I just kinda forget about her being late. But the rest my group was pulling a long  black face. By the time I returned to Cher Hao, he already top the chart with a name I must try to get rid of. Now I’ve to get five races with a timing of 13seconds and above. Headache…      Got a little keeSiao... So i took Lao Er'S PiGgY Head And Place It Over Mine WheN i ReaChed hoMe... Later that nigth, there was this korean movie called “one day” about this couple, undergoing artificial fertilization (I don’t know the medical terms) because the male’s sperms are weak. It was a success and everyone was happy until three months later when the doctor diagnose that the fetus was down with an illness that lets it continue developing without a brain. The mum didn’t want to give her child up because they have waited just too long, she just wanted her baby to see the world, even if it is just for one day. The baby was born and it was heart breaking for her mum to see her in the incubation box. So she decided to end her baby'ssuffering and help other infant with organ transplant needed. Sad story, what is it with korean movies??   As for today, I began full slack mode rigth after i didn have to make a morning call to Tara, cause she sms me that she's awake. Then it was anime breakfast time! Seigaku lost a double's match?? think so, I guess that's what i missed out on last week. Well, they didn won the second double's match. CAN"T WAIT FOR NEXT WEEK"S MATCH!! switch the channel after that and there was this new cartoon "Teen Titans" showing on kids central. It was weird seeing kiddy super hero, not comments on them. As for the 30mins one piece, thank god KC repeated their last episode if not I won’t know what’s happening.  afternoon... stone stone stone...  yupz thats all, i've been doingfor the pass few hours... till next week, Tata
