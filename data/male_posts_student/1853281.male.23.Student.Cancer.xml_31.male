It was cold but not too cold, we were all a little drunk but not tooo drunk(except f. who was not at all drunk) and we caught snowflakes on our tongues at 12:30 am downtown while waiting for the light to change and watching cars go by. Magical, well, not really, but pretty damn cool and all symbolic and stuff. It was the kind of scene indie filmakers put in their films. Oh, and F. called me emo when we were trying to figure out what stereotypes everyone fitted in. Funny, never would have called myself emo. oh well done
