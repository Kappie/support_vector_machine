The game you promised that we would work out. You promised me that we could work this out. I actually thought that we had something. I actually thought that when you stayed with me, that it meant somthing to us, thats why I changed. Thats why I changed. I caught you in a lie, a lie I thought you never would do. I caught you cheating on me....something I never thought you would do. I thought you said that you loved me. They say 2 wrongs dont make a right, so why are you doing this? I cant believe this.. I really cant.. I dont have a clue to do anymore. Im lost without you, and you dont care. As a matter of fact, you havent read one single post of mine yet. Just simple, you changed, I thought I knew you, but you turned out to be a cheater like me, but your happy doing it, I regret my wrong doing, but your enjoying every moment of it. In fact, your on the phone with him, laughing, joking around about how stupid I am. Well I guess I am stupid. I should of never cheated on you, let alone believe that you would give me another chance without something hidden. I dont know what to do with my life anymore now. You tell me to go back to the girl I cheated on you with. But the fact is, and you know it, there was nothing enough to ever consider putting them above you. You were my one and only. I guess my lifes lesson is no matter what you do right, if you did wrong, you will never do right. I tried so hard to make it better, but I guess you didnt want that. I feel like you took a knife to my heart and not just a stab, but you cut it into pieces. I know I hurt you baby and I tried to fix it, You actually had me believing that there was light at the end of the tunnel. You never gave up on our relationship, WHY NOW? Why do you give up when you get what you want? You wanted me to be true to you. Here I am baby! I'm right here, Why dont you want me? why have you changed? Why dont you love me? What does he have that I dont have? I guarantee that he wont ever treat you better than how I was treating you. Yes, he might not cheat on you like I did in the past, but he will never love you the way I do. I hope someday you will relize that.... I miss it all.. I miss every moment spent with you. I miss it already. I cant talk to you anymore. I wont answer your calls. I CANT talk to you. It hurts to much inside to know that if you dont want to be me when I can treat you like a Queen, I cant. I love you more than anything in this world. My love was off and one for you in the beginning, but one thing is for sure, I could never imagine life without you. I guess imagining doesnt do any good now cause im imagining that we are happy. But I guess its a dream, a dream that will never come true, cause you dont want to try. Its been on my mind lately but I have to get it out, I did something that I didnt want to tell you. The other day at practice, I saw her, The one I cheated on you with 8 months ago. She yelled across the cafeteria, that she heard "that kelly left you for good". I couldnt resist it, I couldnt let her go on believing that I was single, I knew that that would only bring me trouble. I turned around and said no thats not true, then I continued to walk.  She asked "Are you too good to talk to me now?". I turned around and said "what do you want from me?". I know you would be mad at me for talking to her so I didnt tell you. She asked if we were together. I said yes. She asked if I love her. I said no. She asked if I love you, I said "I love her more than youll ever know." and walked away, without saying a word. I walked out of that room feeling like butterflys coming from me. I felt like the best I ever had. I had set things straight for once. I didnt want to have a run-in with her ever again, so I set it straight this time. But unfortunately, I didnt have the nerve to tell you. I knew you wouldnt believe me so I just didnt tell you, I didnt lie because you never asked. Ive been meaning to tell you but all you do is get mad at me so I didnt bring it up because all you would do is leave me for it. I just cant believe its over now. After all weve been through, the good and the bad. Some people say, that if we made it through the hell we did, then we could live through marriage. I guess you didnt want that did you? You played with my heart. But like you, I cant stay, I cant stay here try to work it out. I know you were hurt. But when I cheated on you, I hurt myself too, now im hurting again and I think its best to let it go. We cant go on like this anymore. I had that feeling that there was someone else, and I was dreadfully right...I cant believe you did this to me. I cant believe it has to end like this. I loved you soo much, and I still do more than anything. I would give anything to keep you but I cant keep you if you dont want me, so ... I'll miss you soo much.. I'll think about you all the time. There will never be anyone to fill your place. It will take a long time to fix the whole you are leaving in my heart...                                Without you girl, my life is incomplete...
