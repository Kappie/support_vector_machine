Yesterday was a decent day but didn’t start out so hot.  First period we started softball in gym which wasn’t too bad.  It’s not as bad as having ultimate Frisbee where you’re running the whole time and getting really sweaty.  Everything was going fine until Raz’s throwing skills had to shine through while trying to throw me out at third and the ball connected with the back of my head.  Other than that the day went fine.  Model UN ran pretty smoothly During 7th and 8th period I was excused to attend a sound certification training on the auditorium’s sound system.  I learned a couple new things but it was sort of boring and lasted all the way until 5:00.  After that I went straight home and took a nap before driving to the High School for the end of the year jazz performance.  We did fine and Jazz I was once again a treat to watch.  	Today was also a great day. I figured out today that light backpacks make me a nicer person.  I left 80% of my stuff at home today and I was in heaven; I didn’t realize how much I had been carrying until I significantly lightened it.  Today we got to use a notecard on the test AND she made it a partner test!! My partner and I got really confused on the last page but it was excellent being able to work in pairs on the last test of the year. I just got home from the Special Olympics opening ceremony.  It was pretty cool except for having to wear an XL T shirt – that is one thing that really bothers me: I hate wearing shirts that are too big. Hanging out with Katie, Steph, Kyle, and John sent the maturity out the window so we had a little too much fun.  Afterwards one of the contestants come up to Kaitlin – “And this one time,at band camp!!”  You gotta give him credit for piecing together the movie, the instrument, and the hair color, but I doubt Ms. Pope will ever be attending the Special Olympics again.    I found out today from Mr. Butler that because it’s the end of the year, I am allowed to come and park at school without a parking permit.  If I get a ticket I can take it to him and he said he’d deal with it, what a cool dude.    Mom went to Goodwill today and bought a Longaberger basket priced at $5. At the counter the clerk said that she hit the jackpot because avid basket collectors sometimes pay upwards of $100 for them. Can you say EBAY?  They had a sign up that they were hiring so mom brought home an application and I turned it in earlier this evening.  The manager had just left so the lady said that I would probably be getting a phone call. Wouldn’t that be a convenient location.  6 more days of regular classes!  I’m lookin forward to some rockin end of the year bashes.  I want my freaking yearbook! latest update, from my 8th pd. teacher's email, says June 9, homeroom... More tomorrow –   Peace  Chad
