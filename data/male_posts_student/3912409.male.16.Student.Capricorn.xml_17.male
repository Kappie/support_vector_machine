Today I spent most of the day reading the archive of  urlLink  Ctr+Alt+Del  many funny comics at that site. I bought a new TV for my room two days ago, it all started out with me just getting a haircut, but I ended up with a new TV :S. My old TV was a fairly old 13" non-flat screen, but my new one is a 20" flat screen with all the plugins that I needed. I now can hook my computer into the TV to watch my fansubbed anime that I download (35 gigs of it on my computer at the moment), I get a much clearer picture now :D. I didn't do a whole lot today. I would have liked to gone and played some tennis, because of my two tournaments I have within the next two weeks. Well I guess this is good enough for my first post, hope you had fun reading about my life :P  This is my new tv that I just bought, not the greatest pic but whatever I just thought I'd show you.  urlLink
