GERMANY DREW WIT LATVIA........HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA even My beloved Scotland beat them, once,  saw Smackdown earlier, still shit, Raw so much better, its very sad.  Beavis and butthead was great, highlight must be when they photocopied dollar bills, and beavis photocopied a penny, brilliant stuff, tom anderson makes them more funny (the neighbour that the boys ruin everything for) sounds a bit like Hank Hill.  i'm tired, my cousins coming to see me tommorow, he hasnt seen bad blood yet, hes very happy about rey mysterio winning the crusierweight belt, and wants to see alan partridge again, damn that corby trouser press Steph is slowly turning into a big Alan fan, its quite scary, what have i done?  tlk l8er. m.c
