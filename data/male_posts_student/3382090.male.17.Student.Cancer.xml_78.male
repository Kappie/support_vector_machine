well...i guess i shouldve maybe expected it...but yea...anyways..i think catherina or monica/penny mustve called..and then switched over to jaery...keuns wife..so that wouldve been 2nd aunts daughter in law...shes korean..but thats another story..anyhooz...yea...so shes like..is mum home?? is dad home?? but i dont think she could hold it any long and couldnt wait...was already sniffling and stuff...and yea...she was like 'porpor has passed away'...porpor as in her mum in law..but yea...once i heard her voice i knew it was something bad..but to actually hear the words...just really stunned me...and she told me to pass on the news...and she hung up pretty soon after...could hear her crying and stuff =( well...after i put the phone down...i was shot...couldnt study anymore...just kinda sat at the comp...just looking..staring out into nothing...didnt even go outside to tell dad... and then..when mum called home..at 3:00..i totally jumped outta my seat..and when i took the phonecall...she sounded asif she was having too much fun with samuel and audrey..so i couldnt tell her there and then...eventually went down to tell dad bout it...and then aunt may called at like 3:11...cos gran lives with her and all..just rang to see if we knew and stuff... mum came home at like...3:3oish...and i told her...in front of samuel and audrey...the silence was sO bad..mum was in shock i think...we all expected it to happen soooner or later...but just not today...it was always gonna be...tomorrow..or the week after...or the week after that... and yea..she had her cry..went straight over to 3rd aunts to spend time with grandma...  i reallyREALLY hate phonecalls atm...nothing good seems to come from them...and i dont ever wanna hafto tell people something like that ever again >  i dont think that...her death hit me straight away...i didnt understand it...i didnt accept it...it just didnt sink in till after..during the night...i was like...im never ever gonna be able to see her again..never be able to talk to her...never again...and that sinking feeling in your heart...yea...i felt that...even now when i think bout it...its like my hearts just sunk a lil bit...gotten a lil heavier... but..i still sotra feel guilty?? cos...even after all this...ive laughed...ive had times of joy...ive had people make me feel better (and i love every single one of youse *hugZ*)...ive smiled... ive had time to not think about it...but...i know that theres people that this event wont ever has scarred forever...that theyll never be able to get over this pain...never be able to stop feeling it...like her husband...whos practically devoted the last 17years to her health...her 4 sons...her 2 daughters in law...her mum..heard grandma didnt eat at all after hearing bout it...her siblings...  i guess in a sense...im glad that im not living in hk...cos at least im not filled with all this in my face every day for the next few weeks...but there are people who will...my uncles...my aunties...my cousins...thoughts n love n wishes go out to all you guys...   (Boys II Men  Mariah Carey - One Sweet Day) Sorry I never told you All I wanted to say And now it's too late to hold you 'Cause you've flown away So far away  Never had I imagined Living without your smile Feeling and knowing you hear me It keeps me alive Alive  And I know you're shining down on me from heaven Like so many friends we've lost along the way And I know eventually we'll be together One sweet day  Darling I never showed you Assumed you'd always be there I took your presence for granted But I always cared And I miss the love we shared  Although the sun will never shine the same again I'll always look to a brighter day Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep You will always listen as I pray  Sorry I never told you All I wanted to say     And I know you're shining down on me from heaven    what am i supposta be feeling atm?? its like...im sad...but...i havent shed a tear...i really dunno whats going on... mum went to work today..she didnt really wanna...and was supposta have a half day...but i guess to get some normalilty back in her life...  well...today was actually okay...the trials really werent that hard...well...in my opinion..everyone saud that they died =/ does that mean that im so stupid that i dont even know how stupid i am?? XD anyhooz...english was up first...area of study..so it was all the journey stuff...the english tests now...everyone knows whats gonna be in it...its just a matter of remodelling and reshaping the essays youve written in class to fit into the question...  had a calming down kinda thing at the start...at first...they gave the whole 'mobile-phones-are-banned-if-yours-rings-during-the-exam-we-can-fail-you-so-get-up-turn-them-off-and-puttem-in-your-bag' speech...and i swear..half the grade got up and out of their seats to go to their bags XD hahahah..anyways..after everyone was seated back...big debbie demitriadis was like 'i hope you all know your student numbers..two boys have already run out to see theirs'... *tam puts his hand up* 'is it the one we had during the last assessment?' big d: 'no there are new ones' *tam shits his pants* 'can i please go and check mine?' *he gets up and runs out..so do another 40 ppl* hahahahaha nearly got myself into a spot of bother before the test even started..after i pulled out my bag of starburst babies...i kinda ripped it too much and the packet was half open..sO scared..thought it was gonna fall all over the ground..lucky it didnt =)  so yea...the first part..section I...given stimulus material...and hafto answer questions on it...the stimulus material were bitches..a picture of a guy walking on a road...a article bout a couple moving to a country town...a crappy poem....pretty poor examples..especially for inner journey which is what im used to doing...thats what made it hard i guess...i wrote like...2 and half pages on that...did that in bout 30mins...everyones written like 3 or more...hopefully its only cos i write smaller than everyone...but yea...i mean...you dont need to spend so much time on a 2-5 mark questions... section II...creative writing...  write a diary entry using either 'drifting' or 'tunnel' as your stimulus  ...well...i already had a creative writing task...a short story...so anyways..i kinda just adapted that to it..it still works cos its in the first person and all..just has a lil more imagery and stuff than a normal diary entry response...there was a word limit on it so my 2 n half pages there was like perfect..and got it done in the allocated 40mins...just hope the content is aight and the marker doesnt say i wrote a narrative instead... and then...the last section..section III...  'journeys are valuable' - use this quote as a stimulus...referring to your core text...one text from the bos stimulus booklet and various texts of your own choosing'  pretty lucky it was a straight out essay..anyways...i wrote 4 pages...which is heaps for me and my tinified writing...my hand ached so bad after it...but it was a sense of achievement that made it aight =) anyways...i covered the question pretty well..it was just like a practice one i'd done before...did my core text..bos...and 2 of my own... hehe..i had 50mins to do i...10more than usual and finished the essay with about a minute to go ^^  when i got outta there..was surprised how sO many people were like 'omg that was so freaking hard %$^*@#$@' and mark was fully freaking like 'omg thats the worst test ive ever done in my life..i failed it so badly...i wanna die' =/ but yea..i sorta calmed him down a lil...ah well...we had like 20mins till our jap speaking tests...all 9 of us were in the library..i ended up being 3rd last..behind TETS!! the friggen half jap mofo that is smoooOOOooooth as in jap... ahh well...this is tip for all you youngsters...at school...the few minutes before an exam..there is very little chance you can actually study..should just have lil notes with formulas...cos indepth stuff...wont go into your brain...unless you can find a quiet place by yourself... anyways..we were all there in the library...being pretty loud...abO abson was conducting the tests in the seminar rooms...no one was studying so we took out the chess set and had some fun...haha..i actually beat someone in chess XD against the even n00ber mark hahaha and there was this time where abO was kinda talking to umm...dean..and she was emphasising something...moving her head all round..this was after the speaking exam...like she had a lil bit of time to talk over what we could improve on and what we should expect at the hsc speaking on saturday...so yea...shes moving her head and all...and i take a peak over...and im talking to mark and ibby..and imitating her..i take one glance back into the window..and she was talking..but her eyes were on me glaring XD hahaha ah well...when it was time for me to go in..it was all sweet =P hehe..had the whole calming thing down by a lil chitchat at the start...and then did the speaking test..it REALLY went by fast...she said it was like 9mins at least...but i thought we only went for like 4 =D test was scary though..started off with the easy stuff like..talking bout ur family...what you do at school...then it went onto hobbies and stuff...and she started to ask bout music and stuff..and i was all thinking 'nonononono dont gO there girlfriend XD' haha..and yea...she went onto something else thankfully *sigh of relief* i stopped and stuttered alot > ah well..at least i understood most of the questions...just dunno how its gonna be infront of someone totally new and unknown to me =/ i think i mightve lagged it abit cos the debriefing part kinda got sidetracked...lol...was talking bout the dragons win on friday night =P  kinda sad to see jason atm..hes really down now that ruths gone...he said that she went at the 'worst possible time' but yea...im really feeling for him atm...he might be going to see the councillor tomorrow?? =/ hmm...hope he really gets better...long distance relationships can work...so if they really try..itll work =)  i reckon im sO dead for the eco and chem tests...although im a lil confident for the 2u test tomorrow =) better get to study ^^
