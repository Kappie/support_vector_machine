    
       Well, I now have a new email address. I will not be posting it here, but if you want it email me (ha). No, you can just email me at my old address (I will probably not check that one as frequently though) and I will send it ASAP. You can also IM me: nintendophreak20. That will not change. Thank you for your time and devotion to the thoughts of Colin. Visa and Mastercard accepted.
