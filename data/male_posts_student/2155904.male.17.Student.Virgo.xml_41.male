Tyke has been in relatively good moods for quite some time now but really he has just been pushing down his true feelings.  He is hurting and wants someone to help ease the pain.  It is cool having friends who are willing to do so and they really are good friends but they can't fill the void that needs filling.  Tyke needs a "one."  A girl that is not dating anyone.  A girl that is not interested in another guy.  A girl that is interested in Tyke.  A girl that has the same void in her life that only Tyke can fill.  Tyke needs a girlfriend.  It is as simple as that.  The problem is that it is not this easy to do.  Just because you want a girlfriend and are looking for one does not mean that one will come.  Obviously Tyke is interested in Tina.  She is who Tyke most wants to be with but that has not, and from the looks of it will not be happening.  But he is not so "obsessed" with her as he was in the past.  She is a great girl but probably not the girl for him.  So that means he has to think about other girls.  Well, he first looks to the girls he is friends with.  And he thinks "Yeah, I like them and they are great.  I can see myself with any one of them."  He spends most of his time with them and they seem to have an interest in him.  But then he realizes that also cannot happen.  They are all already taken.  So what is next?  He isn't meeting any new girls anywhere so who else is there to be with?  Does he have to wait until college?  That seems like so long away.  All of the girls in his life that he wants he cannot have.  Does he want them because he cannot have them?  Hopefully not.  That would be a disaster if it were true.  But Sunday has always been a day of reflection for him.  He just wants this stupid situation to be taken care of.  He often thinks about how stupid he sounds being sad or lonely or longing or whatever.  But then he just gets into one of those moods and he can't stop himself from just talking about his feelings.  Life is hard enough without the troubles associated with the opposite sex.  The problem with the way he feels is that it is so fluctuating.  Because of his nature, one minute he is with girls like Tina and Purdy and Haras and Mandy and Dottie and he feels soo good about himself.  But then in just a moment he remembers why he was feeling bad before and goes back to that feeling.  It is a cycle that has its highs and lows but the lows seem to last longer than the highs.  He wonders also if he is so disturbed as to actually enjoy feeling sorry for himself and his situation and thus perpetuate this horrible feeling over and over again.  It hurts to be in it but then he writes here and he thinks that he is just trying to get pity for himself.  Which has been true in the past and will probably, at times, be true in the future.  But this is not right.  He should not be so messed up as to need to have the pity of others to feel good about himself.  Why should anyone pity him?  What is really so bad about his life?  So he doesn't have a girlfriend?  So what?  How bad is that really in the scheme of life?  He has a house, friends, brains, and a very bright future.  But he just continues to wallow in this pit.  Someday, hopefully in the near future, all will be resolved but until then, Goodbye.
