So what we should do is send in the Marines to topple the Sauds and take that dump over. Honestly I would favor this. Why not act like the thug the rest of the world thinks we are?  I have to agree with those who favor a more aggressive posture to these savages that are holding us hostage. Threaten to fund their enemies, stop propping them up, etc. Force them to bend to our will. I'm tired of hearing that we are powerless in the world.
