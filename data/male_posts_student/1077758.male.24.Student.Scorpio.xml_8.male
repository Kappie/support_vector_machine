I consider myself to be good friends with several people at work, many of whom were going to certain get-togethers.  Not a word.  On top of that, I was expected to do the work of around 3 people today, which isn't unusual, but I didn't need it on top of already feeling manic depressive during the 8 hours of Kiss Customer Ass-athon.  And one of the girls that was supposed to go see The Two Towers this evening (Good movie, go see. NOW, HYAH!) didn't even return my calls after making a horribly weak excuse about having to do her laundry.  During the short drive home that seemed like a long drive, I wanted a deer in front of my car so bad I could already taste the jerky. I wanted to die.
