You will leave at 8:30 and return at 2:45. On Wednesday, there are two trips planned...a middle school trip and a high school trip. On Thursday, teachers have planned a Superfunday during which the entire school will take a ride over to Cochituate State Park in Natick for a day of fun activities. Stay tuned for the list of things to do. Then, on Friday... our last day of school, we shall have an opportunity to watch the beginning of the take down of Phoneix. Beginning on  TUESDAY ONLY , students may take 5 minutes at the end of their class in Phoenix to write a message(s) to write a message on the walls of the building (inside, not out!) It must be clean, positive and appropriate. If it's not, it will be scratched out with an indelible marker. If you don't have a class in Phoneix, you may write during break.
