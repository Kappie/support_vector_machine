It's not about me; I got over that a couple of days ago.  It's about where I am, who I live with, and people I love who just can't seem to get along.  I'm not going to air my family's dirty laundry here for the whole world to see, but I'd just like to make a solemn vow and promise that I will keep until I die (maybe longer):  1.  I will never, EVER degrade someone in front of them (and if I can help it, in front of anyone else).  There is nothing worse than seeing a person who has been beaten down by another person's harsh, hateful words.  True, that person may be angry, but there is never an excuse for reducing someone to dirt level simply because you're angry.  2.  I will do my best to keep myself out of financial trouble.  My goal is to get a job now so that I can provide for myself, and to get into a good, stable career following college graduation.  Some of the things I see happening to those around me is shocking and scary.  I don't want to see that happen to me.  3.  I will treat my future wife (providing I find her) and mother of my children with the utmost respect.  I couldn't ever imagine doing anything less, yet to some people that seems to be okay.  4.  I will always do my best to be involved in my child's/children's life/lives.  I will not sit on the sidelines and watch them grow up before me and not do a damn thing to shape their moral/psychological being.  5.  I promise to not let myself lose so much self-esteem/self-respect that I can't stand up for myself.  I will not let someone talk me down without a fight; I'm better than that.  Additionally, I must have enough self-respect as to not allow myself to act in a manner that is not in-line with the person I consider myself to be.  Never sacrifice self for situation.  Ever.  ETA: 6.  I also promise never to hide between a stupid wristband to show someone how I feel about them.  HA!  Take that, Mr. M!  I'm wearing a wristband that expresses my intense hatred of you!  Bet you feel like crap now, don't you Mr. M?  Bet I've just ruined your self-image and self-esteem now, eh, Mr. M?  HA!  TAKE THAT!  Yeah, see how stupid that sounds?  If you have something to say, say it.  Otherwise, shut up and grow up.  If you don't like Mr. M, say it to his face.  If I got the chance, I'm sure I wouldn't mind doing so myself.  I just needed to get that out of my system.  I want nothing more right now than to get out of this hellhole, but I'm stuck.  To stay here another year is going to test me more than I previously thought, but I have to make it.  It's hard walking into the same emotional baggage day in and day out, knowing every day that you're going to come home to the same old thing.  For all of its splendor, there are times that life can really suck sometimes.  But hey, it's those times that make us grow, right?  If not, I'll just keep telling myself that just to make it.
