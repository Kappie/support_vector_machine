One of my favorite news stories this cycle has been the elevation of Annie Jacobson to minor celebrity status for her  urlLink harrowing account  of how fourteen Syrian musicians engaging in "suspicious activities" with a McDonald's bag nearly hijacked her plane. Beyond singing the praises of racial profiling, it's also  urlLink complete bunk .  But that doesn't prevent our friends on the other side of the aisle from coming up with  urlLink new ways to spend our tax dollars .  Man, what a great way to earn a quick C-note...I'm sure Jesse Taylor's already  urlLink working on his tan !  I think it's just precious: we go from sensational, barely verified reporting that proposes a shortsighted answer to our immediate fears (racial profiling of airline passengers) to an equally shortsighted answer (let's give them money for inconviencing them!). I cannot say that I'm not fearful when I get on a plane, but I'm more worried about my luggage than whether I'm going to end up plastered to the I-beams of a local skyscraper. Given the thousands upon thousands of flights every year, the statistical probablity of actually ending up on a flight with a bunch of terrorists building bombs in the head makes worrying about it incessantly rather...well, silly. I know our security has more holes than a good block of Wisconsin swiss, but  what can I do about it?  I'm not willing to compromise the rights of others just to feel safer for the few hours a year I spend on a plane. We all shell out our dough and sometimes we have to sit next to the fat guy who falls asleep right away. I don't want the next thing we all share to be a rigorous questioning by federal officials.  More generally, it's just getting harder for me to follow the news these days.  Watching one presidential candidate  urlLink wall himself off from his audiences  while the other has to  urlLink blatantly pose with the flag  so roughly half the country will stoop to look at him (let alone listen to what he has to say) is disheartening. Then there's the Bush administration fielding yet another outrageous idea: let's save corporations money by  urlLink sticking it to workers ! That'll push the markets even higher, and maybe get our economy rolling again! But wait...didn't our very own Vice President get in trouble for trying to artificially inflate his company's stock?  urlLink Oh...right . Never mind about that one--he's too busy rewriting energy policy to favor his pals in the private sector.  And let's not  urlLink forget  about  urlLink Iraq , or all the  urlLink money  we're spending on it (what could  I  do with fifteen grand?  Hmmm...), much as our news media would like us to.  But then I'll stumble across something like  urlLink this , and it's just enough to pick myself up again.  Who am I to say the Boss is wrong?
