Because people who leave away messages on their instant messaging programs that literally spell out what they are doing.. should shampoo my crotch.  period.  Leave something humorous, yes.  Leave the standard "I am away from my computer right now." fine.  Select "I am on the telephone." okay.  But don't tell me what you're doing, who you are doing it with, and leave us all stereotyped as people who give a flying fuck about how you are consuming the moments of your day.  Bring something to the table worth while, like a joke.  Make me laugh with something witty.  "Went to the post office with Suzy, then to the bank, and finally some relaxation time in front of the TV with my pals," on the other hand, is NOT acceptable.  A former friend of mine used to post an away message daily.  I swear he was never actually available online, but simply switched from one away message to the next depending on the changes in events of the day.  It got to the point that it was so irritatingly funny, that I would update another friend through e-mail of the best away message of the day.  Each day I would e-mail my friend with the one-liner that appeared in the other friend's away message.  I guess it sounds pretty stupid, but the messages were just so ridiculously detailed that it drove me crazy.  "Gone to the grocery store, then cooking dinner for the gang" or something as obnoxiously youth-groupish.  Next:  My trainer is @ DisneyWorld with his family.  Shawn, come back.  Not only am I slacking on my workout without the motivation of paying you, I miss our reality-TV chats each week.  It's hilarious to go to the male version of a beauty parlor (the gym) three times a week and banter with Shawn for an hour.  We started discussing ABC's "The Bachelor" each week because one of the "Bachelorettes" was an OU student my age, who also worked out at the gym.  Trainer-Shawn and I would laugh it up each week "did you SEE how she was all.."  Not to mention my brothers' ex-fiance was one of the contestants too, though short-lived on the show, we had plenty of material to work with.  It's amazing the things you learn.  I love hearing all the scoop on everyone else that works out there.  Makes me kind of skeptical to open up too much, who knows what material I'm giving Shawn for the next trainee.  "Oh that Mason character.."  nah, who am I kidding.  What's he gonna tell someone else about me, that I don't do my cardio like I should.  JUICY SHIT!   So many quasi-celebrities out of just one simple workout facility as well.  The runner-up on "The Bachelor," for one.  Then there's that guy who got beheaded in Iraq (or wherever).  He apparently worked out at the gym and lived here a few years back.  Even a famous pornstar from Norman that used to work out there when he lived in Oklahoma still.  Shawn knew the pornstar guy's family well and apparently I resemble him so much that Shawn used to call me by the pornstar's first name a lot (his real name, not his "porn name").  I finally was like "who is Dan (or whatever his name was, I forget) and why do you keep calling me that?  He explained.  NATURALLY I did a Google image search, and I have to disagree that I look like him.  Besides, I'm not as built.  I'll take it as a compliment though regardless.  Shawn said I should take it as such, as the guy was "quite a stud."  What else, what else.  Oh I guess I'll just stop talking about the gym and GO there to do my cardio.  That's what I was supposed to be doing 30 minutes ago anyway, then I decided to post.  Maybe that is why the majority of this post was about the damn gym.    Off I go, but before I do, I'm going to post my away message on AOL Instant messenger.  I think the appropriate message should be: "Lather, rinse, repeat motha fucka."
