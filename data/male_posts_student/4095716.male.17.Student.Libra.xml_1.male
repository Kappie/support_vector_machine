The Giants have lost... *sob sob* tHey played a frustrating game and didnt look close to scoring... or at least hardly.... Couldnt believe it.. im really really dissapointed.... it actually is a quite dissapointing day... i lost playing pool 9-7 to my friend Doug... and 1-0 in snooker... which came up to like 17bucks a person.... but there will be a rematch soon enough... Another shock... "Dream Team" USA have been demolished by Costa Rica.. Im dead serious... Whatz up??? no Kobe, no Shaq, no Richardson, no wonder they lost... they lost by 19 points on top of that.... really irratatin me.... anyway... till next time... pEace
