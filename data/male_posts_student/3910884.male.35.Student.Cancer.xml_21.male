Many parents and participants stated that without the scholarships offered, many of the students would not have the opportunity to attend school because of the poverty level that many of the families are living in.  Most (if not all) live in small houses on private owned or government owned land and face the posibility of eviction. Many homes are ramshackle conglomerations of lahar-created bricks, rusted tin roofs, and plastic sindings with no window covers.  Most of the families are large with some having as many as 8 children and being in a single-parent home with a spouse that has succumbed to either an illness or tragic accident.  The main concern of the parents as well as the children are those of income:  1) An increase in their allowance from the foundation. Currently the allowance is 20 pesos a day however this often supplemented by the parents since the students need roughly 30 pesos a day and when the single bread winner only makes PHP 250 or so a day to feed the family, you can see the obvious financial strain this produces on the family when the allowance is supplemented out of pocket by the family.  2) One parent asked if there was a chance for the children to participate in livelihood projects that would allow the children themselves to supplement their allowance. Some of the children work on the weekends and after school already which threatens the amount of quality studying time needed for their courses.  The foundation as well as the students and parents realize that to break the circle of poverty that they are subjected to is to become educated. With education comes opportunity and with opportunity comes the ability to make choices and to feel in control of ones life and with control comes empowerment and an improvement in one's quality of life.  The public school system in the RP is also stressed. Although public, tuition and books must still be paid by the students. Classes of 50 or so students with 5 or so students sharing a book is not unheard of.  Many of the public school students are motivated to be in school but because of financial reasons, must work to support their families. They mention that if they received an allowance, this would allow them more time to study. They also wish for more technical skills like being familiar with computers. They also hope to continue their education to high school and even into college.  All in all, small steps are being taken to reduce education gaps in the Philippines but the educational system is overworked and underfunded. Interventions are needed to supplement the struggling education system so that these motivated students can achieve their dreams and so that the chain of poverty is broken.
