Insomnia and idleness always leads to me think about things or people in ways that I shouldn't... I think that's the single thing about myself that I'd really like to change, cause it's doubly unhealthy. The lack of sleep and dwelling... straight up... right now it's a feeling of... well... being lonely. Being close to someone again during winter break, kind of reminded me how nice it was to have someone or at least feel like you potentially do. Yea... this sounds fucking emo... but hey... I'm human too. At least on the bright side... I doing some decent artwork as a result of this.  **
