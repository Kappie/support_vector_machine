This is so friggin intricate (maybe a little on the tedious side, but well worth it) and I'm the one who made up the blueprints!!! Anyway, I've been working for a total of about 3-4 hours, and I'm maybe halfway done with the framework for the torso. Not counting the sleeves of course. I see myself finishing the framework for the whole getup tomorrow with the guys, then putting the scales on on Sunday. It's gonna be badassedness to the tenth degree.
