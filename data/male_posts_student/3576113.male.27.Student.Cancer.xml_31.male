How often are they passed, or discarded?  As much lamentation as one might come to posess, embrace fate only full of heart and empty of mind.  Then maybe new paths can be forged.  What amount of honor can overcome one ounce of shame?  I imagine it taking a lifetime of effort to discover.  Of longing I know, the emptiness that comes with absence.  Hehe, though with the words of the Count, I await to end such tenure in style.  "Missing is over", so good.
