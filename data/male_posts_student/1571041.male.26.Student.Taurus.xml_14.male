We got to the pow wow and I suddenly realized that even though it is a local thing, it's still pretty nice sized.  Anyways, they get to promoting themselves through their cd sales and I run into Tray.  We talk about this li'l concert that's supposed to go on, and eventually we get to heading to the community center, where it's supposed to be held.  Nice and fine, but no keys to get in.  Not only that, not much of a system to work w/ either.  But, this was all last minute, and we were definitely short handed.  Regardless of the odds stacked up against us, we still managed to pull it off, but not w/out the li'l conflicts.  So, I get to helping lay out the tarp to put on the gym floor, and not only that, finally get to checking the li'l system available to us.  Not only that, but also set up the rez'd out system for the 'dance' that accompanies this concert.  Yeah, but in that time, both acts (the rez hogs  lost tribe) head out their own ways for awhile.  So, people are waiting around, asking about the concert and dance.  Meanwhile I'm getting things arranged and when things start to finally look up, I see that the performers aren't around?  I manage to find the rez hogs and that part is settled, or so I thought.  It turns out they want to watch how the Lost Tribe does their thing and request to go 2nd.  No problem I thought, but when tray leaves because, 'he wants to be around when more people show up?'  That leaves just the Rez Hogs w/ a full crew, but they aren't going to perform until the lost tribe does.  Well, it's just Tuke around, and he's just waiting on tray to show.  So, people are starting to filter out, thinking nothing is going to go on.  After tray shows up, things get a li'l twisted.  He starts to demand that they're going 2nd because they'll 'tear it up, no doubt.'  I'm looking at the rez hogs and shrug my shoulders.  They say they'll do it, they're not that picky about it.  So, I get to cuing up the songs and stuff, but also have to play sound man, because one guy is smooth and laid back in delivery, and the other is hyped and amped.  Same deal w/ the lost tribe.  During the rez hogs' set, a couple guls get on stage and want to dance around stage.  No problem, they take advantage of their good fortune by dancing along, and rapping to the crowd.  They cut their show short, and let me know that this is just something thrown together, but they appreciate the chance to hit up another spot to get their name out.  Then it comes time for the lost tribe to get their thing on.  They are the local folks, and got some folks to watch them.  They did support the rez hogs though as much as they could by trying to get people into their performance.  things worked out though, and both performances seemed to be what the people didn't expect, but appreciated.  So the 'dance' is supposed to happen, but instead of people sticking around for that, everyone went outside.  Most likely it was all to find out where the party was going to happen that night.  I'm there basically just playing music for less than a dozen people, and most of them are either barely in high school, or still in grade school.  Oh wells, something happened that normally doesn't happen, young natives seeing other young natives doing something other than partying around or trying to hustle a way to make some ends.  I did what I could, but I felt like it was all too little too late.  It seemed to work out for both acts anyway.  So, they both get some sales and the folks get their first show from natives locally and from a rez close by.
