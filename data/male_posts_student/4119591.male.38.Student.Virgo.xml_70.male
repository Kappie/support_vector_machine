Some time ago (perhaps even as many as 15 years ago) MTV stopped playing music videos.  A friend of mind told me that they play music in the wee hours of the morning because the more expensive-to-produce talking shows don't find their audience at that time. I instructed my ReplayTV DVR to record a segment of MTV over night and, sure enough, the channel plays a good number of music videos over a period of three hours. Some of them are in such heavy rotation that you will see them twice in that time span. Anyway, that's when I realized that I had fallen completely out of touch with anything even remotely "youth-oriented." Long ago I passed out of the much vaunted 18-34 year old demographic and so too passed beyond the grasp of this channel with which I once connected so well. I did like most of what I saw however -- even though I had not a clue who the artists were.  Darned kids. ;-)  PS: Hey, I miss  urlLink Martha Quinn .
