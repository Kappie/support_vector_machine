EXCEPT THERE IS NO RELATED MAIN IDEA, so you used "this" because you're too stupid to think of another word that rhymed. got that? ("that" being a pronoun to represent this entire paragraph, which would be what we call in the states "proper grammar.") and you said "oh oh" in a song? then you rhyme "love" and "trust"? YOU'RE FUCKING KIDDING ME.  why did you have to go?  this, i would normally have no problem with. innocent statement. except you COMPLETELY contradict it later in your song when you squeal, "don't think...the fact that your arm is now around my neck." you JUST SAID "why did you have to go," implying the guy's gone. now he's presently groping your neck? and your chorus says "did you think that i was gonna give it up to you?" how can you give it up to someone who is GONE? shut up.  did you think that i was gonna give it up to you? did you think that it was something i was gonna do?  wtf, you said the first line then you said, "i won't do what i said i won't do in the first line!" pulitzer, anyone?  i'll have to kick your ass/and make you never forget  first off, a guy that gets his ass kicked by you is really fucking weak. or maybe you meant that line literally. you better have. (and you rhymed "pants" with "ass," which means this sucks regardless.) "and make you never forget" is just a throwaway line that means nothing (if you kicked his ass wouldn't he already remember that?), tossed in because it RHYMES, which you DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO. idiot.   i'm gonna ask you to stop, thought i liked you a lot, but i'm really upset  dear god. so you'll ask him to stop. first, how fucking stupid are you to tell someone you're gonna ask him to stop before you actually tell him to stop? you don't care if he actually stops or not, you just want to tell him to stop. go feminism. and you're really upset? horrors. go call the u-fucking-n.  yeah that's what i said  you're pathetic.  now let's make fun of the prototypical hip-hop song "40 oz." by d-12! oh joy, equal opportunity satirization! first, let's have some random mc yell derogatory racial epithets and random f-bombs just so we can pretend we're hardcore!   you know how we get nigga, we wild in the club motherfuckers  then, let's realize this whole song is centered around a stereotype of drunk, violent, bitch-slapping african americans!   where the 40 at? guzzle it!  then let's have bizarre yell 3 words a line about shooting people and smacking hoes and smoking blunts!   one of y'all niggaz gon' catch a slug i'm so drunk, i can hurl for a month... ain't got no problem with slapping no bitch... blunts, gans, that's all we smoke  then eminem can yell the same thing using more words!   who's trying to be the first one to catch this blade in the throat you kno them po-po won't let me hold them toasters no mo'... chuggin' on our 40's and holdin our forty-fo's  then kuniva can repeat them again while employing unnecessary imagery that adds absolutely nothing to the song! (how many exclamation points can i use before you get annoyed and stop reading!)    i settle my vendettas with ak's, barettas... switch blade, brass knuckles, nickel-plated belt buckles broken beer bottles...bitches cryin'  then proof can repeat all of the aforementioned smokers-drinkers-shooters-stabbers-slappers ONE MORE TIME just in case you're half-deaf and you didn't hear them the FIRST THREE TIMES!   if your chick get loud, i'll g-money that bitch packin' mags and clips, i'll smash your clique... smoking weed, drinking henny, remy and that jimmy  go hip-hop.  finally, here's my rendition of a generic punk rock song.  "go away" -- really fast   go away! that's what the title of this song says really fast! that's how fast i want you to run, cuz i don't like you anymore, but also that's the name of my band, which is funny because all punk is the same i rock, i don't even need a rhyming dictionary or a songwriter...aw shit...pictionary is a fun game, anyway, i want to sing about hating you because its you i want to live without  (chorus) go away! i don't like you! i want to be alone i want to be myself, you make me not my own once you go away! i'll finally know who i really am not the person you made me to be, that's not who i am  i made it to the second verse without repeating myself i'm so happy, oh wait we're still recording huh, shit
