I left off with me going up to my great grandparents house to roof for the weekend. I went up there with my uncle and cousin and my dad, the ride took somewhere around 8 hours there and back. We got finished almost the entire roof the first day and it should have been easy to finish it all the day after. That didn't happen tho, everyone started lagging and slowing down the second day. My back was aching and I still can't full rotate my wrist without it hurting. I was shoveling and nailing and hammering and sweating the entire trip. The best part is the self-acknowledgement of a good days work given to you via the big pool of brown shower water at the bottom of the tub. I don't know if I told you this, but I got a job at Jimmy's. YAY!. I'm excited that I'm actually getting the opportunity to enter the working world and be taken seriously. Then again I'm nervous for all those same reasons. I've got to remember that this is something I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life. Kind of seems like a prison sentence. Ah well, Get to look forward to that paycheck! Since then I've either been at someones house or working. My Mom and Dad got into a bit of a situation over the time I haven't enetered too. They were arguing as usual but this time my dad shoved my mom and she started bleeding from her elbow. She then called the cops on him and he took the breathalizer. Drunker than a irishman on St. Patricks Day. So he got taken away by the cops and can't enter the house for 72 hours. He's staying with Grandpa Wally for now. I don't know what's going to happen when the time runs out. Maybe they'll go to therapy and maybe they won't. If they wind up getting a divorce I know I get to pick which one of them I want to go with, and normally it'd be my dad, but I don't want to go with him if he's going to be drunk and not taking his depression medicine. But I don't want to go with my mom because if i do that means its final and i want to be with my dad. If I tell the judge I want to be with my mom until my dad recovers, my mom would have to be informed of this deal. I don't think she'd be too pleased with it either, most likely a lot of stares and glares and a angry vibe to go along with them. I just hope my dad recovers before this happens. I freaked out over my possible-liking of Cory. She was right there along with me to listen to me, but totally faithful to James. I'm letting her read my Blog right now, I trust her enough to let her read this. Ech! I wrote something about her and James that I didn't even remember and it was....definitely not the most encouraging piece of literature she's read. She says she's not mad at me, I'll listen to her. She's my lifesaver and my comfort when I'm in need, I need her a lot more than she needs me. (It's not a biassed opinion because she's reading my blog right now, it's the truth) I had a weird dream where I still liked ashley koller...only she had orange hair and lived in nikki's house.....which had tunnel in the floor that led to a island with cracks in the floor that led to the center of the earth and walls full of library books.....I think I went back upstairs and started talking to Ashley's parents, (which were nikki's parents) and they gave me a towel and said, "you left this here last night, its yours." (Then the dream ended.) Some other stuff happened in the past week, if I remember it, I'll tell you. Til' then. L83R
