I rode up to the bank and someone said hi, I of coarse replied and we all started talking. I don't know if this will work out very well or anything but I sure hope I see them again. Just now he told my dad that I threw a speaker at him...and my dad crashes in here and totally freaks out at me! I soo wanna stay in Qualicum, but i soo don't wanna stay with them. My dad has totally ruined my life so many times. Whenever I get a life, he takes it away.
