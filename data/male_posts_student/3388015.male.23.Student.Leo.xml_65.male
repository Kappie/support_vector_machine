She had a huge list to buy and I had two items I needed.  I came back with 20 items and Cindy had less.  I need to stop going to Walmart.  Cindy got some Pelligrinos, I made some chicken patties.  We ate ice cream sandwhiches, oreo cookies and drank milk until the cows came home.  Well, 1am to be more exact.  We played skip bo in between.  I told Cindy we need Emily to come over to play with us.  Today was okay.  Stupid tour this morning.  I went to UR, I don't need to take a tour of the campus.  It was hot, I was sweaty and I wasn't feeling well.  But the day went pretty fast and I made plans to see Harry Potter with Linda.  So I rushed home at 5, got my car and went to pick her up at the MRB.  She was waiting inside the building while I was waiting in the circle.  He friend got in the car and we called Linda 3 times, but she wasn't answering.  We waited and waited and waited.  She finally came out and her explanation was "it didn't occur to me to come out".   Oooookay.   But the movie was terrific, it was over 2 hours long, but it felt like 10 minutes.  I'm watching Kathy Griffin on Bravo and the cat is attacking is attacking my feet.  Oi.
