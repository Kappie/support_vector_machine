Only thing that sucked was it was right in the middle of the day, so I couldnt really get anything done.  Oh well.    Im getting very frustrated with my body lately. I feel slow, sluggish, and my back still hurts.  I dont know if this is a weather thing, but I dont like it.  I was doing great for a while, and then boom.  Brick wall.  No motivation or anything.  I also missed a week while I was doing my finals which could have hurt my progress.  But then again, it was probably better for my back.  I dunno.  It was weird though.  In our little meditation session/tai chi sword after class, John seemed to read my mind.  He was talking about how some days, you feel your chi and can move it no problem, other days its hard to move it, and yet some days you cant find it at all.  Yesterday was one of those days where I couldnt find it at all.  He also talked about how even if you dont feel it, it is there, and it is still moving, so even the slightest bit of practice can help out.  Makes alot of sense in my mind.  So yeah, for today, I need to clean my pit that I call a room and then possibly TKD and then possibly waiting in line at 10 to go see Return of the King at midnight tonight.  Sweet titties... I cant wait for it...
