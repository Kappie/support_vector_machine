I have had a head ache every since i went to skool on monday. it was really bad this morning so i had a panadol (even though they dont normally work 4 me) and went back to bed. when i got up, it was 12noon. i watched last nights tape of  The O.C. and Rove Live. I cant wait for the weekend. My head ache is back again and its really starting to piss me off. is the address you gave me going to be a permenent one or not? i need to know for when i am in Bali. cya later Ren√©e
