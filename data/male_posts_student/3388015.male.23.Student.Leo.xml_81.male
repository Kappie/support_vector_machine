Friday night, Laura, Cindy and I went to East End fest, got a great meal at Golden Port and then went to an Improv comedy show at the Geva theatre. It's the same one we went to a month ago and it was still very funny. We enjoyed ourselves. Laura went home, Cindy and I hung out for awhile.   Saturday Cindy slept in all day while Laura and I went to Darien Lake. We had a lot of fun, did all the major rides, however, the park was packed and we didn't do everything. It's okay, we'll do more again.   Sunday, Laura and I went and saw '13 Going on 30' which was a funny movie, cute and romantic, kinda. We then went shopping in Henrietta, went to a card shop, dollar store, D store, Brueggers, Best Buy and finally Target to buy some gifts for the wedding we're going to on Saturday. I had been cooking stuff in the crockpot all day, so when we got done shopping around 5, we came back, I picked up Cindy and we all ate spaghetti and turkey meatballs.   Both of them left, and the cat and I hung out and watched TV and whatnot.   Monday was nice. Work was blah, but Linda met me at my office at 5 and we walked back to my apartment. My bike chain broke while we were walking (ugh!) but that didn't deter us. We went to TGIFridays and had dinner. I got my new Goldpoints card, we got some free food and once done, we went to movies 10 and watched Van Helsing. It was a good movie! Surprisingly... Cindy hated it when she saw the first 5 minutes, but after that gets done, I enjoyed it. Some parts were weird, but whatever, sometimes you just have to sit back and enjoy the action.   I got back and Cindy and the cat were watching TV. We hung out, but I took Cindy back after she needed to get back and read for her class.   Today, Tuesday, was pretty much a repeat of Monday. Work was blah, but this time I had to walk to work. It was sprinkling, but that wasn't bad. Gym at lunch, as usual. We had a cake party for JB (coworker) and Lisa (finance) at 4. After work, it was pouring rain, so I hitched a ride with Donna (coworker) back to my place. I was a little late and I was meeting Laura at TGIFridays at 5:40, so I was basically late then and there. I got there, we had a wonderful meal and when the bill came, my portion was $2.50. Ha! So I left $7 and split to go pick Linda up for the free movie. All three of us were seeing "The Manchurian Candidate"   Well, Laura went and got us seats and I hurriedly picked Linda up across town. We got to Regal Henrietta by 7:10, but tons of people were being turned away from the movie. "Sold out!" they screamed as they stomped away. Uh oh.   I called Laura. She was saving 3 seats, so I went in to get through the gate, the guy said the movie was full, I explained the woman I was on the phone with was holding 3 seats for us. He escorted me in, we saw Laura, he let us in.   The movie was good... it was a typical war movie / political movie. I liked it, it was weird at times, but the jokes Laura and I said during the movie made it better. However, I think Laura is right. If we were ever in a comedy troupe, nobody would laugh at our jokes. :)   Linda and I stopped at Krispe Kreme, we got a free donut, a cold drink and I dropped her off. Cindy texted me, she needsa new phone cord, rats chewed her old one.  Okay, now I'm alone in my apartment, watching the Democratic Convention and I need to go bed.
