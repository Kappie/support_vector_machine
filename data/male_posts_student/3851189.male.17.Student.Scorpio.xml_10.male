(just kidding marc, no offence taken) actually, marcus is my classmate in SRJC and he's very pro in english.. he's a very good debater from my school debates and even clinched the 4th best speak during the inter-sch tournament.. e reason tt he didnt score well this time round could be that he's unlucky bahz.. coz selected questions for compo was really really badly done as according to wat our teacher mentioned as looks can be decieving.. the questions were demanding.. langage bias and meritoracy aside(u'll understand if ya marcus or ivan, l0lx.. yeah? =P) we've gotta jiayou for our As lehz.. Since Keynes started with the 'Paradox of Thrift', i shall start with my own 'Paradox of As'..   the theory goes like that.. khim believes that revision is important to get good greats for ya As.. on the other hand, with increased revision, it leads to a fall in the quantity demanded and supplied of leisure time.. consequently, standard of living will fall.. eventually, u'll be too stressed and cause yaself unneccessary frantic.. in the end, revision may even drag u down.. -.-` haha   the practicallity of this theory has yet to be proven but is strongly applicable in our day life.. in any o how u like to view ya own like.. rememer the paradox of revision :)
