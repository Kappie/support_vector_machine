Ok, we were quick to think that she's dead, but when your cat is gone for two days and weighs about 4 lbs and is that old, you start to worry if they can still handle themselves.  She's hardly eating, so Iunno whats gonna happen.   I worked yesterday and then had to help Tamara get the computer at the office to Compusa.  While I was there, I got some Bawls and some case. sticker things.   Unreal and AMD.  Woot.  Then today, I worked and while I was weedwhacking, I didn't wear jeans (too hot) and my legs kinda got pelted with debris.  Oh well, I need to change how I walk with that thing.  Last night (whoa, I'm skipping around here) I played diablo 2 for about 2 or 3 hours with Jake Stark.  God..... I need help.  Seriously.   I have a serious problem, and I need to be cured of my D2 addiction.  My Car is at Ballenger's automotive, getting the shocks fixed, since its been a bumpy little ride.  Speaking of which, I registered for 7:30 -9 am driver's ed classes in the summer.  I chose that to conveniently put them before work.  I hope I get enough sleep!  I have few other plans for today.
