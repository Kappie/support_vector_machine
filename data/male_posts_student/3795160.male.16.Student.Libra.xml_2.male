Hopefully in a week I'll be done with it and have uploaded it. The main reason why I've been so busy is that it took me some time to get a couple of my sites pages working on a count of them having a lot of JavaScript in them. They're working great.  Plus I've also found some time to play a little Photoshop Pong on a few forums. My first match was, infact still is, versus OlssenE of  urlLink The Asylum . He mysteriously vanished in between the game but cam back with not much of a challenge. You can see my bout with him here:   urlLink Templar654 vs OlssenE   Another match of mine is against Arendje of  urlLink GF . This guy seems to be a pro, his serves are pretty darn good. But they're still no match for the Tempster! Watch my bout with him here:   urlLink TemplarXT vs Arendje   Well that's a wrap for this post till the next, God Speed and keep your Mom happy!
