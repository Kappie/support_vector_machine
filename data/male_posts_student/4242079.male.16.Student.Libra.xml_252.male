Someone decided it would be great to go and see Holly. So we picked her up and went and got some pizza, which we brought back here and ate while watching the movie "Willard". I still can't decide if I really like that movie or not...Yes. Yes I did. It was only mildly disapointing, all in all, it was good. Hmm...what else did we do...Holly went home because her parents wanted her home for supper, but she ended up coming back here after we got off the phone with Eddie. Then, we pretty much just sat around until Kylie had to take her car back to her mom, but we all went out there, played Taboo, and had a good old time. Now, here I am. I must apologize for the awkward silence while driving Holly home.    Sorry, no deep perspectives on the world tonight
