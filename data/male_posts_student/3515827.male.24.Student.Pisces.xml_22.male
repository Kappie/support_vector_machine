Although, even though his blog is really good, and he sort of sounds like the drag queen I’ve always wanted to be, he still gets filed away in my little box for “kids who are not that much younger than me but younger enough that they just don’t get it.” By “It,” I mean, the notion that one is never as attractive as they think they are.  I can think of several times, when I was younger (not much, I'm 26 now), and cuter, that I totally thought people would just take what I put out at face value because I had such a cute face.  This is kind of like that "spice-girls"-type feminism; it demeans everyone, including yourself.   In other news, I have been listening a lot to Dolly Parton lately, moreso than I used to.  I found this new album, "Trio," which features the music stylings of dolly, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris.  Now, I wouldn't by any stretch of the imagination classify myself as a person who likes country at all, but I really like this.  And for one as unpatriotic as myself, I feel like this is a big step for me.  Of course, they don't really ever sing about pride of country , more about broken hearts and lovers who have left them (of course, the idea that any man would leave Dolly Parton is just laughable).  Anyways, I've got to be moving on.
