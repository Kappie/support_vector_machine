For example at one point I went 36 hours without sleeping.  Fairly stressful, but we got Fall break starting thursday so that will be nice.  I have to go t Jefferson City for my Grandma's 90th birthday party though so It might be a big waste of time.  Other than that it's late and I need to hit the sack so I can wake up for my 8:30 class tommorrow.  I wish I had something more exciting to tell you guys but I'm trying to keep my life as stress free and interest free as possible.  NOt as easy a task as I would like but I think I am the right man for the job.  Allright everyone take it easy and I'm going to end it with a line sung by the great Pete Townshend, "I hope I die before I get old."  NOt sure why end with that but hey why not.  I'ts my thing I can do what I want.
