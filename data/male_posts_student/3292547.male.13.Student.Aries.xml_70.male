If you ever find that they no longer work (no matter how long down the road), please e-mail me so I can re-upload them and change the links.    I like to make sure people have access to everything I've pointed and linked to even if it's 30 years from now. Once I get $$$ and get a paid host I'll move my blog and  everything  over to it. That way I won't have to depend on free sites that have bandwith limits and I won't have to worry about having pictures and stuff on some site that may go down.    Anyway, here are the links. Please don't use these unless the actual site work. I'm not even sure I can do this legally. =-)    urlLink Shrek   urlLink Shrek2   As a note, the intos link back to themselves in a never ending loop. So clicking skip intro won't work. lol.
