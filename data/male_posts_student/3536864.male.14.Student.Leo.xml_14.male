I felt inspired yesterday when I saw the clouds rolling around, but today......I just don't have it.  But there are storms here.  Oh yes, storms a plenty. I have been driven to my storm shelter 4 times this year.  They call it Tornado Alley for a reason. As opposed to other places like "Missouri, land of discovery" or something like that.  I can discover something in montanna if I wanted to. But I don't, so haha. If you think that was a bit odd, please read the disclaimer in small print at the top of the page.  Now you're going to look at the top of the page and see what it says.  I actually don't know that for sure; just a guess.  And this has gone all over the place.  Back to storms.  I love storms. Some people don't. I love the rain, the smell of the storm before it strikes, the color of the sky after the clear, sounds echoing throughout the entire enduring cell.  Lightning with flashes so bright that you are blinded in the darkness that surounds you created by the presence of the clouds. Other people that don't like storm are a bit odd to me.  Great way of displaying God's creation.   It's pitch black outside.  But you know what they say, it's always darkest right before it goes pitch black.  So now, I'll have to leave the rest of this space empty.....just like outside.....except outside it's black and not empty, and here it's black and empty.  So decided which one you want to believe.  Chaio!
