Or is it like the your spirit? *another question- how do you have a spirit if you're not dead yet?* is your soul something that everybody needs to live? so what is a soul?    please post a comment if you read this and you can answer my questions thanx   And Chichi, LinZ, and Sonya *who never reads my blog* I could use some of your opinions because they are most of the time always great.
