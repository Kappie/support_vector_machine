What makes the win even sweeter was they thrashed the evil LA Lakers led by the mad scientist(Phil Jackson) 4-1.   It even could have been a clean sweep if not for the Detroit collapse during game 2. Even though the team I am supporting, the Indiana Pacers, lost to Detroit during the Eastern Conferences semi-finals I still salute the Pistons for a job well done. Not to mention preventing old Philly from getting a record 10 NBA Championships.  SO HAIL THE DETROIT PISTONS, THE NBA CHAMPIONS... JUST LIKE THE QUEEN'S SONG 'WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS'...
