Tonight I'm gonna tell you about some new teams that will have their own episodes soon:   Cybe   R.   Team     This group consists of 5 heroes who went to Sa2b's Gang for counseling after gaining thier own powers. Members include:  Cybe R. Teknik- A hedgehog whose robot arms house and array of weapons, including the extremely powerful Cyber Flash  Jane Strechel- A hedgehog who gained a pink elastic body in a lab accident that involved silly putty  Pyde Arak- An armadillo with powers like Spider-Man, except that the webs come from his fingertips  Giette Armour- A hedgehog with organic armor, plus her own sword and shield  William "B.B." Blayne/The Snarl- Think of him as a 7-year-old version of the Hulk  But that's only one team. Here's the second:    H unting    P ack     Nightshade- A liger born on the shadowy side of the Tree of Eternal Light and Darkness, he has complete command over the world of the shadows. He sometimes gets a little carried away, though...  Slyless- A wolf with a knack for escaping from a locked room with nothing but a toothpick and a bottle cap. She also has powers of seduction and can make any man fall for her  Leo- A liger born on the brink of the Tree of Eternal Light and Darkness and the twin brother of Nightshade. The hair spikes on the back of his head are removable, very sharp (thanks to the wonders of SuperGel), and he can hit a target dead on. He was also gifted with amazing strength  Gust- A coyote who spent most of her life in the section of the woods near the DiscoRama Dance Center. Therefore, she is very 70's-oriented, right down to her hairstyle. She has the ability to go feral  Vladamir XIII- A vampire bat who spent most of his life in a clock tower, feeding on the blood of the livestock that are are shipped by. He has powers of flight and hypnosis.  All members of Hunting Pack have retractable claws in their fingers, speed, and super senses, as well as being nocturnal.  Well, that's all folks! look for stories about these teams in the future.  -Sane Into  lerant-      DR, if you want to put the last names for Hunting Pack, that'd be great. If you do, erase this bottom message.
