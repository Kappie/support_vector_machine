Jason rang the doorbell, but I still don't feel well enough to do anything. As of now I'm trying not to listen to '99 Red Balloons' or 'Chicago is so two years ago' because I know I'm going to overplay it. I also kinda want to continue the Red Dress story or atleast write another scene, but I have no motivation. No scene is jumping out at me. :(. Then there's the Warped Tour. Bobby and co. (My best friends who live 1300 miles away) are planning on going. *tear* Maybe Katie or Sam'll go.
