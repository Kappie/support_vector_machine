School + physical labor for another 5 hours = mucho tiredness. *yawn* All but three of my classes this year are pointless and boring, those three classes being Pre-Calculus, Economics, and AP English. Everything else is...bleh. Yes..bleh. Ok so I can't think of anything else to put on here so that's it for today. Peace. \m/(--)\m/
