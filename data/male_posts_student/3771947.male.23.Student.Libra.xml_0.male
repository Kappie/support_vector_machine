I feel something is pulling me to Georgetown, yet I fear what I will find when I get there.  So much has happened these last two years.  I often wonder how I ever made it.  Dave, Andy, Brian - without you three...You guys have carried me when I couldn't carry myself.  I have looked to you all for advice.  I will never forget you guys, wherever I may be.  Doug, what happened?  You have changed.  I don't know you anymore.  At one time we were inseparable, now I don't see you for months.  A word of advice, your girlfriend won't always be there, but I would have.  I guess you will learn the hard way, like I did.   For the first time in my life, I don't have the answers.  Only questions.  Sometimes the questions are more important than the answers.  I do know that I am looking for myself.  Who I really am.  I get a new start, a new beginning.  What will I find when I find myself.  Will I live up to everyone's expectations?    I am still holding a little back.  It's time to let it out.  Georgetown, I hope you can handle me.
