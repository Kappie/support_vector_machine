The mind's loss A beautiful thing Goodnight and Sweet dreams of nothing  Where do I go from here? Another distressful night I remember what you said And you are always right So I started to fade away And you walked through the door You want me to end your fears But I can't face the horror  And in my eyes were doubt But the words that came out...  The mind's loss A beautiful thing Goodnight and Sweet dreams of nothing
