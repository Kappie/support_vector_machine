It all started with Andrew Sullivan, who I use to admire until he morphed into the unapologetic hack I suppose he always was.  For the blogs I currently read on a daily basis check the links on the right of this page.    I'm trying to learn HTML now so I can make this blog a better and less generic looking piece of shit that you find in most pages around here.  I'm not sure what I'll write about, or how often I'll write.  I'm a shitty writer and I doubt anyone will read this anyway, so I suppose it all doesn't matter.
