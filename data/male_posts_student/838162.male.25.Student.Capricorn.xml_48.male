Well this morning I wrote a quick one to another overseas friend that I have not heard from in sometime and guess what? Within two hours the person came online and we chatted over ICQ. Which is rare, as this one is in a stressful and busy enviroment.  I have another friend that I need to catch up with too. If I can get her away from work that is. I had better mention her before she finds out I forgot about her in yesterdays post and takes my head for it  ”There can be only One”  Word to yah D.C.  This email thing seems to be working out so far. Guess I better keep it up. Looks like there is more to email than just for mailing list, newsletters, subject updates, and infrequent questions and greeting cards.  Well...back to work.
