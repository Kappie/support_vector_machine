Once you have chosen Me, you set the pace.  It is you who decides how quickly you grow in Me.  I do not force myself upon you.  I woo you.  I call to you because I long to be with you.  Can't you see that all you have to do is ask?  I'll give Myself you- up to the amount that you desire.  I am not angry with you, my children.  This is a lie of the enemy.  I have always wanted you.  Ask for Me, I'm so glad to give myself to you.  ------  The Lord is willing to reveal himself.  "Ask and you'll receive." When you earnestly seek, He pours himself out.  He is saying to us--  These are serious times.  You cannot afford to wait until later to grow in me.  Come now and you will find what you seek.  I am preparing to pour out wisdom, maturity, and my gifts upon those who desire Me.  Live as though the tomorrow that You will see will be the last- because you don't know!  My signs, wonders and miracles will be poured out through the seekers, and many will wonder.  Many will be afraid.  Many will turn.  But there will be multitudes that will come and believe.  And those who labor now are building my bridge- that which will be made from the hard work and labor of my children will act as a pass for those new workers to come across and into deep intimacy with Me at much greater ease than those who built for years.  In this, I say, REJOICE!  For the Kingdom of God is for all who come.  Your reward is me, you laborers.  Do not turn your eyes from Me and your brothers in these times.  I am your sufficiency. ---  pray for  prefer one another.  Lift each other up. because God is Love.  amen.
