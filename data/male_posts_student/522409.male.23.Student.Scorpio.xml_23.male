I've been moving my stuff from the Cape to NH and to Boston, and from Somerville to Winthrop, and sitting in traffic from NH to Boston and the Cape to NH and everywhere in between... and today, we moved Mary down to Wheaton before continuing on to the Cape, when I loaded up the remaining pieces of my Cape Cod life into a UHaul truck that dad and I are taking up to Winthrop tomorrow, then unloading, then driving back to NH.  Then (yes there's more) I'm taking stuff from NH to Winthrop one last time before settling in at my new apartment at 1 Coral Ave, Winthrop, MA.  So there will be a giant sigh of relief followed by several days of sleep once I reach Wednesday.  I don't know what to do with myself right now.  I'm no longer talking about packing/moving/cleaning.  I'm talking about guy-girl stuff.    First off, no one who knows me would ever accuse me of being a relationship guy.  The sad irony of that is that I crave that closeness and that feeling of belonging and all that good stuff... it's just that right as I get to the point where I could enter into a relationship with someone, I shut off.  I lose interest, or at least I tell myself I do.  It's awful.  So first of all, I'm not over this pre-existing situation that's been such a giant let-down for so long.  I understand that once again my friendship gets to take a backseat to the guy of the moment, and I'm starting to deal with that.  In the process of getting hurt myself and realizing that I'm forever locked into this cycle, I managed to hurt someone I hold very dear to me.  She and I need to talk.  We're gonna talk, you.  Very soon.  And now there's Christina.  The situation with Christina scares me because I can't find a thing wrong with it.  Every time I get close to a girl, I find some way in which she can't stand up favorably to the one I always use as the standard (is this making sense?  please bear with me, as I'm well past exhaustion and into delerium).  Well I've caught myself trying to find excuses... those little unconscious processes I go through to give myself an excuse not to fully open myself up to someone.  And for once, I haven't found any.  And I'm thrilled.  And frightened.  Because now I'm really on the verge of something wonderful, and I'm terrified that I'm going to mess it up.  Gah.  I want to be in 3rd grade again.  I want to give a girl a piece of paper that says "Do you like me?  Check one: __yes __no __maybe" and have her check yes, no, or maybe.  Then I want to go with her to a junior high dance and dance slightly less than arm's length away from her while making awkward small talk and trying my hardest not to step on her feet.  Is that too much to ask?  I miss Mary.  And I love my friends.  Slick is moving to Boston.  How cool is that?  Now we just need to get Fozz and we'll almost have the whole Sound there.  More later.  I'm thinking a quick nap wouldn't be the world's worst idea.
