But it doesn't, it just stays all gloomy outside until morning, where it'll look all sunshiney and do the same thing the next day.  This, as I've come to conclude, is bullshit.  I don't mind the cloudy, grey, weather, as the few of you who've been keeping up with me may have come to know, but the fact that it stays such a warm temperature without even a dose of relief is beginning to drive me mad.  RAIN ALREADY, GODDAMMIT.... So I can go do that thinking thing. I really need it.
