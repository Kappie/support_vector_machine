It is time for his trustworthiness, responsiblity, and all of that other crap to be "tested." I am positive that  JR  will do an excellent job while I am gone. If something  does  go wrong, I will be sure to punish  JR  (i.e. firing him) when I get back. Just kidding! Like I said, I am confident that he will do a superb job.  Also, thank you  JR  for those wonderful thoughts about me! HAHAHAH.....   Other than that, I have nothing else to say really. Did you hear about the "cascading power outage" all through the North East? and in Canada? Pretty devastating for those people.... No Internet OR T.V.!!  If I do not blog tomorrow,  Stay tuned  and have a wonderful week!!
