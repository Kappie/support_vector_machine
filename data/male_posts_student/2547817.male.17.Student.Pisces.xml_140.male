I've turned my bag inside out thrice now and gone through each page in each book and I still can't find it. It's important! I have to go to school early tomorrow morning to look for it about the drama area. Or maybe in the class cupboard. I shall write back.  Tomorrow is blood donation day.   As of now, my poetic veins are dry. I've been bled too many times in the past few days. I'm afraid I'm losing my edge. I'm in trouble. Have to finish the ode to my school bag! I tried today, but it wouldn't come!  Very worried.
