As you all know by now, Sun made a deal with Evil(TM) Microsoft earlier this year to prevent any litigation against each other. I'm sure that Evil(TM) Microsoft pushed Sun to drop their pressuring Java VM thingy law suits because they maybe own some patents which Sun are using in some of their products. So, if Evil(TM) Microsoft begins a War againts those whom are using their patents illegally(Including SUN), Sun will be safe. Linux will get a big hit, and Sun will get a big rise.  Grr, i wrote a much better post than this yeasterday, but when i hit 'Publish Post' i was asked to enter username and password, and the whole post was lost :\
