Then we ate, and then went to Athlete's World...some half price sale. I got another Adidas Baseball Jersey, Shirt, swimming shorts and socks. Meh all that for 60 bucks I wasn't complainin'. Ugh can't find anywhere that carries enough old school Adidas stuff  Anyways I'm gonna go eat now...after watching the game I'm pretty hungry. Plus I kinda don't feel like blogging since Calgary kinda uhh...lost.  Hmm hope Jenn's doing well on her exams. Hmm...hope the rest of us will do well on our exams lol.  Well God's always around, and I know his guidance and wisdom is always with us, as he never forsakes us =).  Anyways I'm out. Later.
