I have this theory that taekwondo is actually a tiring activity that upon reaching home...I just sleep and not do any work at all...I don't know pero this past days, I haven't actually done a lot of work as I should have been when I am at home...  So here I am...I wanna do the bibliography thing for Doc Pes now...as in now pero I'm so damn tired...later na lang...  GA with GABAY yesterday was quite so-so, and I have to finish this sig sheet pa...and I'm meeting with my angel (Ate Gema) later so she can help me out...there... And I have this interview pa with ADS...its actually not an interview, we are supposed to give a 5-minute speech on what is supposed to be a "very debatable" issue...there...I haven't actually thought about what to say...Man, I might ruin my chances of getting in...and I didn't submit the Guidon Web requirements na yesterday because I was...er...tired to it...  And its a sign, the Flash MX I installed in my fucking pc didn't work, meaning I shouldn't apply for Guidon Web, maybe next sem? or the other? but not now...  I'm actually freaked out at my ADS speech later...I have to...er...tie myself up during math in order  to um...do it properly...   And I got a new quote from pier...Never expect to much! The more you expect, the greater the pain! Thats quite nice...  Um...sige, I'll post emails pa...  --Logged Out--
