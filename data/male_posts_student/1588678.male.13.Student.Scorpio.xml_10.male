He ends up in Jack White of The White Stripes' dressing room. He comes out in a red and white suit and says,  "Their first album's better."  Then he ends up in Missy Eliot's dressing room and comes out in a blue jump-suit. Then he ends up in 50 Cent's room and says,  "Hey 50!"  After he says that you hear a couple of bangs and a thump on the floor.  You gotta see the commercial. You can't miss it. It's on  all  the time.
