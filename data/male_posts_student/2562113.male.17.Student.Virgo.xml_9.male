My car is leaking gas now, and the ominous puddle of gas laying under the car is pretty much proof that I'm going to have to replace the fuel tank. I filled the tank last night so the leak must be near the top of the tank. I wonder when I'm going to wake up from this nightmare...  Tom called this afternoon and asked if I was willing to work tomorrow. I graciously accepted the offer, as I need to make up for these costly car repairs. It's going to be interesting to see who else shows up for work tomorrow, considering everyone was fed up with the job by the end of last summer. Looks like we're headed over the bridge to some unknown place in Mahopac. God I hope we don't have to sand some big, dirty gym tomorrow.  Justin called me a few minutes ago asking if I wanted to go to Stiletto's tonight. I would have went in a split second but I had to turn down the offer since I have to wake up at 7:30AM for work tomorrow.  I took a sleeping pill a little while ago since I know there was NO way I'm going to be able to go to sleep before midnight when I've been going to sleep at 4AM for the past week. Drowsiness is really starting to kick in now, I'm probably going to pass out in a little bit...  -BIGsmut.
