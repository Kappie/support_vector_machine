No doubt your fake plastic friends are much more interesting than us, anyway.   Did you lie to Chris Derby when he asked you if you were posting the comments on his blog?  P.S. John: I messed up one of the song names on that mix. Instead of  Brian's Lament  by the Souls, that should be  We're coming back . Thanks.
