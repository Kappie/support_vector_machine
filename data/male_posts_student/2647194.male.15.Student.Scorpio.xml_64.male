I want to go into engineering, and I need to learn this stuff, but Mrs. Williams isn't the best helper for stuff. Damn parametric equations and conic sections and implicit sh*t.  Science: did assignment, attempted to work on math  Band: rehearsed some stuff for concert, attempted to work on math  Spanish: Did assignment, did not attempt to work on math, bought 2 posters at the book fair: -The Matrix Reloaded -MINI Cooper (!!!those are cool...) I plan to probably buy the American Muscle Cars from the 60's poster tommorow, or the Ferrari Enzo poster. Probably the former because its got multiple cars on it, kinda like my Corvette Evolution one. And Craig, I'm not selling it-sorry.  No funny from today, as 2 rows were switched, making it so Matt and Anton were separate from the rest of "us".  English: did crap, discussed "The Cold Equations"  Social: did stuff, I got a perfect on my test, what's new, blah, etc.  Anyway...there was this "ice cream anti-social" (lol) at the orchestra tonight. Wasn't too fun, as I didn't have any ice cream. Other than that, it was pretty much the same as all weeks-and no LOTR tonight. damn.  Lets explore why MSA is such a great place for finding someone to date. Note the sarcasm here. A few examples: -Jamie and Buddy, who goes to Oltman -Kacy and Ryan, who doesn't go to MSA -Michelle and Jeff, well, ok, but Jeff's switching out of MSA after this year -Jon, even though we can never determine which specific girls he's hanging out with every Friday night...lol -Will and Anysha, who lives in New Zealand (geez, man, find someone local!) -Sam and Carly are a rare pair, but Sam's most likely switching -And finally, Amanda and I, with her attending Cottage Grove Junior.  I swear, MSA is a very far cry from being  *whew!* almost got caught there...stupid mom knocked on the door and scared the crap out of me. If I do get caught, I can't go to the Chops concert! I know, I know, big risk, but I have to blog. lol.  As I was saying, you just don't have good odds at a school with 50 people in your class. In other words, there are downsides to MSA. It right as rain does pay to know people outside your school, if its MSA. grrrr....too small....  Well, I should probably get more sleep tonight than I did last night, seeing as that I didn't do my math tonight, and tommorow, ITS?!  *CONCERT UPDATE* Jazz Coffeehouse tommorow night at 7:00 PM! Everyone needs to go!!!! Lots of SPP people are going, so, yeah. Just go. It promises to be an awesome night of food and kick-a$$ music.  I like to use a large variety in my lyrics and bands here, so here's a band I haven't ever done before. Its kind of an odd band, but its a good song. Really.  "Whenever I’m alone with you you make me feel Like I am home again whenever I’m alone with You you make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I’m alone with you you make me feel Like I am young again whenever I’m alone with You you make me feel like I am fun again  However far away I will always love you however Long I stay I will always love you whatever Words I say I will always love you I will always Love you  Whenever I’m alone with you you make me feel Like I am free again whenever I’m alone with You you make me feel like I am clean again  However far away I will always love you however Long I stay I will always love you whatever Words I say I will always love you I will always Love you"  -"Lovesong", The Cure, covered by 311
