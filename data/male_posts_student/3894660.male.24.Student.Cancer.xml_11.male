I wasnt happy abt things and simply it wasnt fair if i kept quiet but lose my temper frequently........  Y was i so upset? Simply because I felt unappreciated, insecure, controlled n dictated.........  Unappreciated cause she always says I dont love her, I dont care about her......  Insecure cause.......she called out another guys name during.......  Controlled cause she questions every thing I do......  Dictated cause she demands from me so much................  . . . . . . How did the call end.......well we trashed out our differences and our views......hopefully things would get better...........  I love you darlyng..........for ever n ever............
