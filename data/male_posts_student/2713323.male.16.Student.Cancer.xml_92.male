It was portugal that won! yeaahhh. simao rocks, and so does his hair heh. i slept at around 6am and woke up at 12, ate chicken rice which had kickass packaging. took a bath, changed, and went to pick hui up. i had a bloody flu. the usual, we went to jalan jalan. my flu got worse after a haircut, bought some medication. sheesh, flu on a date, how very....memorable. thanks spc fo taking care of me yeh. heheh, after, i took her to see my mom and godmom, which was not as bad as i expected, just plenty of questions and the same answers over and over again. she came over, and i took a nap after she left. i slept and woke up in the middle of the night and used the computer, humming to the stokes...talking to her. slept at around, i dont know mate. so here i am in the morning, with my wrists and fingers swollen and puffy. morning blues. meh. Panadol Cold Relief, non drowsy formula. 20 caplets. wonder what if i took 12 in one shot. oh yeah, i rememebered what my dad said after he watched the passion of christ. it was something like... "this may sound blasphemous, but i think jesus is a conman."    damn.
