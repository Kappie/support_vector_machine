I've only known her for three days and already i've told her things about me that no one not even my best friend knows about. She's a real angel, and i'd trust her with my life. She talked me out of doing the deed and she actually showed she cared. That's proof that she really is a good friend and she really does care. I still dont know what higher power decided that deserved to meet her, but i can say i thank them with my entirety, i dont think i could have ever met anyone soo amazingly stunning, with such a great persona, someone who cares about each and everyone of there friends, i still dont understand why fate led me to her, nor will i ever really, i mean wow, she's amazing in everyway possible.  *end rant*  Well two of my best friends are comming home from their trips today...YAY!! I can't wait to see them. I miss them alot, but oh well, they're lucky i'm not...i've got a good friend that's online that i can always talk to!(i think you know who you are) anywho that's my rant for now, lets see if any other crappy events come up today
