Woke up early, but was spending the hold morning trying to do my LC write up draft. “Trying” is the word, I don’t even know how to start. Along the way, I don’t feel like going to school. I mean, going to school just for a 2 hours LC lecture, I might as well stay home for the rest of the day doing other stuff. Hiya, but I’ve got no excuses to not go. I rather keep those “ponning” days when I really need to skip classes and still keep a good attendance. Yupz, so I went to school. It was boring, even Lester fell asleep during lesson. Those 2 hours feels like half my lifetime, everybody ran out once the class is over. Ha… guess it was just too horrible.  All was fine, dinner, TV, web surfing… Until…. Hmmmmmmmm…… guess I shouldn’t blog the details… Tanjie, if you’re reading this. Hope u feel better after crying. Have a good nights rest after finishing what you can complete.
