Well yesterday I went to the src (Student Representatives) annual dinner. We had a great time at the GPK in Castle Hill. Basically we just ate pizza and talked. I wrote a post yesterday, but: IT DIDN’T PUBLISH OR POST! SO I LOST AN ENTIRE POST WHICH OUTLINED MY CRAZY SHENANIGANS!!!   Heres a brief summary of what I did:  Arrived two hours early (I took the last bus of the day which came at bloody 4.45)  Bought the mothers day gift.   Stuffed my face. I had more slices than anyone else on my table. I also had not one, but SIX glasses of coke and lemon lime bitters. I also had, not one, but TWO cups of cappuccino. I think most of my crazy behaviour was caffeine induced.  Danced around.  Took off my undershirt, without taking off my t-shirt.  Forced my self to finish off a LARGE PLATE of the most disgusting Mediterranean salad, I should have known better, but Madeline called me a WUSS! I wasn’t going to take that  >: (. It was painful but worth it.  Discussed about hot celebrities, mainly about Colin Farrell with Alyssa.  Talked about how crappy living in Australia was compared to living in the US. Dammit, why don’t we get cinnamon gum and good public transport over here?  ALMOST got involved in a food fight that was luckily averted.  Saw Goths, heaps of Goths, at the premiere of Van Helsing. Yup, even the posers, who dress up in overcoats and metallica t-shirts. Actually, come to think of it, they were ALL posers.  Hmm… I got to have my photo taken.  Almost asked a cute waiter for his phone number (Yes, I know, I AM male and straight, but Alyssa wanted it, who in the end decided to make me back out)  I guess that’s all I remember, I think I should go out more on Friday nights, well maybe when I get to Uni. I also got my folder today. I wonder what I’ll put on it…  Well the exams are coming and I’ve got to study soon…  It’s been good.  Cheers,  Colin
