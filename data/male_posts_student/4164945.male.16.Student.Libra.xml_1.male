(haha, you know where this is heading, doncha?) the price for premium ranges from $4-$100, depending on the subscription. just hearing the words "not" and "free" in the same sentence set off some sort of alarm or spider-sense, something in my very asian consciousness. man, that was almost as bad as hearing the words "lets get married." i obviously didn't want to pay to upgrade, so i decided to "jump ship" so to speak. as much as i love xanga, it just isn't worth paying for something that everyone should enjoy. i mean, c'mon, if your mom is being passed around so easily, why shouldn't xanga? damn, for a $100 i better damn well be immortalized. so, now we're back to my point: why should i? why should i pay for something as trivial as typing a few measely words onto a homepage, and only at a fraction of blogger's capabalities. a fraction of blogger's capabilities! oh gee, that sounds  so  much more appealing.   premium, pssh. i suggest you take that $100 and think about that, xanga.      so enjoy my new blog, 'cause if you don't...a good day to you, sir. oh yeah, please leave tips. i'm still learning html as i go.
