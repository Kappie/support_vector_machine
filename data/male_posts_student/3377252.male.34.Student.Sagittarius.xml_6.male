Still, I am sorry I offended anyone.    Apologies for not posting anything lately, having some difficulties lately.  My father suffered a stroke this past week and I am still in some shock about that.  Many thoughts have gone though my mind about what is "proper attitudes" in fearful times like these.   Again I will espouse the Christian faith for times like this, not that the faith needs someone of my limited abilities to defend it.  But the hope of the faith in Christ as anchor is comforting in perilous times.  Knowing that not all tears are not in vain, if a Savior and God can weep for a friend he knew he was going to resurrect, but even more impressive is where Jesus weeps loudly over unrepentant Jerusalem.  My tears are pale compared to those for my father, for my family and for me.  Yet weeping comes joy of salvation, may God use this for his glory, may he give me wisdom and discernment to praise him as Job did when he lost his children. Tomorrow is another day and another day full of grace, May the grace of my heavenly Father strengthen my earthly father in body, spirit and soul.    JOB 1:20 At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship 21 and said:    "Naked I came from my mother's womb,     and naked I will depart.   The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away;     may the name of the LORD be praised."      JOB 1:22 In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.
