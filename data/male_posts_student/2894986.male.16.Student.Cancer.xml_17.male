Lucky Boy Confusion and Story of the Year rocked. The other two bands weren't to good, but nothing terrible. The third band, Hazen St., had some weird ghetto rock thing going. Let's just say that was very odd. For most of our group of about 10, this was our first rock concert. We really didn't really know what it was gonna be like, but once we got there we had a lot of fun. Even though the lyrics were hard to hear over the music, the songs were really good. We stayed away from the crazy people up closer to the stage. And nobody was brave enough to crowdsurf.   Other then SOTY, I didn't really know what the bands were singing but Lucky Boy Confusion had a really good sound. SOTY played all of my favorties and they sounded really good live. They also put on a good show up on stage. The band had a lot of energy and knew what to do to keep the crowd into the concert. The crowd was large and the music was loud, which made the evening really exciting and enjoyable. When the volume is cranked up and the band is putting on a good show, you can really get into the music. It also made me deaf for a few hours. The fact that it was a smaller concert also made it better. It allowed you to be close to the stage, but you could also stand in the back and still be very much a part of the concert. Jillians and WLRS put together quite a concert. Can't wait for the next one.    I was holy today. I went to church. Yay for me. It's Good Friday you know, so don't forget to clap your hands for JESUS!
