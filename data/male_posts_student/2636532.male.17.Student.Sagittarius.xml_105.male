I seriously cannot wait until i move out in the summer, Broadband here i come.....i know that alot of you fools that actually read this crap are thinkin' i sound like a fuckin nerd... and ya know what.....to some extent YOU'RE RIGHT!!!!!!! but enough about me and time to get back to this internet shit, can anyone tell me the reason for this blog crap that i'm doing right now? honestly what's the point, if someone really feels the need to write the thoughts and their aspirations and what happened to them last weekend over and over again, the ymight as well write a fuckin book for christ's sake. guarenteed there is at least 1 publishing company that would pay you for your mindless ramblings. and ya know what.....if oprah got a hold of a copy it would probly become an instant best-seller, the new york times and all that crap. but ya, i think i've vented enough for one day but i'll be back.....ohhhhh you can be sure of it, and you'll rue the day you crossed me. HHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!(continue with maniacal laughter)  -Errol
