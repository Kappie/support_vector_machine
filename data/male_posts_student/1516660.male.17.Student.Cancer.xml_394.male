This time, however, I did not have the luxury of getting up late. Nooo.... I have to get up at 6:30. Sigh. Ku ming ar! Sigh. I bathed then we went out lor.  Yes. I slept on the ride to the Maxwell Food Center, and slept while waiting for my century egg porridge to arrive. HaHa. Okay, after breakfast, it was 8 something.  Well, we arrived at NSC at 8.50something. Well, we get to see this Alfred Choi guy. Heh Heh. He reminds me of Mr Jeremy! Really! He got a strong American accent, looks kinda ABC-ish and likes to exaggerate things a lot.   Right. I found out that I've got eczema. It's a skin condition where my immune system is over-sensitive to irritants and produces rashes and sores. My skin is excessively dry. Sigh. Eczema is permanent. Yes, it can dissappear...temporary. A flare-up might occur sometime. Sigh. I need to keep my skin moisturized all the time. To do that, I would have to try not to sweat. Ha! Fat chance at that! I sweat even in air-conditioned places. Sigh.   After the consultation, we went back home lor. I took the remaining morning to finish my Maths homework on 3D Trigo. HaHa. Think I am handing it up tomorrow, in case I forgot on Monday. Yep.   Okay. What else happened? Ehh..nothing else le. Kinda boring afterwards. I can't cook up minutes, 'cause I don't have enough materials to cook up something belivable. Heh Heh. Therefore, I read fics all day long.   Right. I think I am going liao. See ya next time with a report on tomorrow's MDIS performance! TaTa! Night!
