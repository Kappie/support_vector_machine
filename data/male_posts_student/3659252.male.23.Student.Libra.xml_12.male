       
      Ladies, would you like to do tea today?   (Rephrase: If we don't do tea today, I couldn't be a part of an Earl Grey hour until next Monday.)  Sorry about the late notice, but I just found out that we are leaving for New York tomorrow morning to see some family friends.  Sunita, I know you have plans with your mom... are you spending the day together?
