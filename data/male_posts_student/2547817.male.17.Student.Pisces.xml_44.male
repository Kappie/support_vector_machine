I should kick myself in the ass. I'm disappointed. I contradicted myself time and time again. Blithering infidel! I'm swimming in a cold, dark, infinite ocean. Gong nowhere coz there's nowhere to go. I AM NOT A DRIFTER!  I'm lost today. Will probably be tomorrow. Even then, "Thy will be done" God, grant me the  Serenity to accept the things I cannot change. Courage to change the things I can, and the Wisdom to know the difference.
