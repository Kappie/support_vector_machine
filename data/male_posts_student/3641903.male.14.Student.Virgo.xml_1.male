Also Linkin Park ROCKS!!!!!!!!! i went to the concert at the last minute due to the fact a friend of mine in the standard first aid course gave me her friends ticket because her friend had a very bad fever, 39.7 degrees celcius according to her anyway her name is jess short for jessica, same age as me from dunno what school girl guides, dam chio, anyway i took her out for lunch today, my treat of course as a token of appreciation for giving me the Linkin Park tickets. ok back to the Linkin Park concert i have only one thing to say, IT ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and i got and autograph from all of them, buti left it in jesses bag, so i got to collect it back from her first, i also forgot tot collect it today!!!!! I got the $150 ticket from jess and saw Brad Delson when he was jumpin around nearly fell hahahahaha and Chester threw the water to the audience because he commented Singapores weather was hot, still cannot stop thanking jess for her great big heart in giving me the tickets!!!! i am gonna miss all the friends i made in the standard first aid course, especially all the chio gals i made friends with, but i have all their msn addresses so i will still be in contact with them. ok yesterday i had to go for GOH training and had a lot of fun playing with the M-16, hanging around with my comrades in arms, and so on and so on!!!! but one thing is so dam right what Sir wie jie told us, that what the school say about the Marist spirit in the morning assembly and canteen are all bull shit, what is the Marist spirit was when i whole gang of Marist NCC cadets who are tired and hungry still volunteered to stay back to help move the equitment, so the volunteers carried tyhe equitment and also carried the podium and had fun by pretending we were soldiers carrying a fallen soldier's coffin by singing the funeral song, when that was done all of them went up thr 5 tonner and sang the school song loudly until the whole camp could hear despite we being very tired, Now that is the Marist spirit!!!!! so we ended up going back at about 8.30pm, but we marched out proundly as a united unit and also we march out using chinese commands, dam funny as it made us sound like we are from the china army, also made fun of jack neos new movie called the best bet by singing "bai leui li bai hui bu hiu kai" hahhahahahahaha dam fuuny. ok by now CJ is in her malay camp moaning and groaning wishing i would kill her now and wishing that she herself would be dead, hahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!! ok i will end my entry here as tommorrow i have another GOH training for the NCC day parade so BYE!!!!
