That game is really boring.  I don't know why we were playing it.  I guess it was a good conversation piece.  We were just making fun of everything in the game and it was kind of funny.  The games boring though because you find out some stuff about some people then you ask other people and go to places to get info and do this and that.  Oh yeah and those things involve moving books around, scrubbing walls, and catching a leaf falling from a tree with two fingers (on the same hand, side by side).  Wow.  My eyes were bugging out on that one.  I'm going to get that one tomorrow morning I assure you.  Well I had fun though.  Mucg better than just sitting around and watching TV by myself.  :-)  Monday is going to be weird.  I don't want to go back.  :-/
