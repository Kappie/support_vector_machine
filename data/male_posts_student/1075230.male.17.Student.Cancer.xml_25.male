The third period I used to walk around the school in search of people before sitting in english and doodling. Fourth Period I was  supposed  to go to a Guidence Appointment, but I realised I messed up my schedual and it was actually supposed to be fifth, but I missed it because at fifth I was a Gym Conflict Resolution Seminar with these guys who were teaching us  Budo  The way of the Warrior... They taught us how to fall and how to flip someone who grabbed our wrist.  As I mentioned in my last post... Last night I got a haircut... and yes... it is short... really... really short... Am I bald? No, not that short... but  much  shorter than it was, or should be!!!  meh  at least I can gel it.  WTF??? My dad just told me he wants me to vacuum. By the Gods, I vacuumed 2 days ago! What, he wants me to vacuum everyday??? *sigh* Tomllow. I refuse to vacuum till tomollow at least.  *sigh*  meh   -ArV
