We had some people come from towns that are fairly close come and play... they're so much better then us :(... we also had some one come from France, he was really good. I won my first singles game I had, although it wasn't really hard because it was against someone I've played many times, I beat him 8-0 (yet again) :D. After that I played one of the kids from out of town... holy Jebus munkyz that kid has a hard serve (he came in second place), I got hit by one of them and it hurt. So that was the end of singles for me, then I had to play doubles. In my first game I sprained my neck which... kinda hurt, so we lost that game, but went into the conciliation round and came in second place for that. The last doubles game I played was the best game of the whole day.    Hahahaha... ok one thing that I must say is that my friend Wes was playing in the girls doubles tournament... I laughed at him good. He said he would have worn his high heels but they would have given him blisters, and I don't remember what he said about wearing a skirt.... but I remember laughing at him after that.    Yeah k, well after the tournament was over I biked home and took a shower and then collapsed on my bed. Eventually I got up and had some more pizza.... ummmm.... again.... 'cause I had pizza last night and this morning for breakfast and for lunch at the tennis club and again tonight.    So I just finished downloading Naruto 91 and I'll watch that in an hour probably and I'm still waiting for my Hikaru no Go 2004 New Year's Special to finish. Tonight I'll finish watching the Hikaru no Go episodes that I skipped, the ones that were just side stories and had nothing to do with the actual story.    k, I think I'm about done for tonight...
