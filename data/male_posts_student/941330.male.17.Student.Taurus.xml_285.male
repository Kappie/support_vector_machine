[catherine] flipped on her hazard lights, swung over to the shoulder (not completely, apparently, which brings me to My Note(tm): idiot), and slowed down while [jefferson] leaned out the passenger side window and tried to shoo the dog off the highway." then, what do you expect on highway fucking 85 but "a turquoise speck in her rear-view mirror ... 'coming like a bullet.'" thankfully, the baby oceana escaped unharmed, but 6-year old catarina suffered a broken leg, 7-year old jefferson III incurred multiple fractures, and 12-year old tomas was killed. this ultimately is a meaningless gesture that will never be seen by anyone who's connected to this, but i offer my condolences for their loss and pain. however, i am not pete wilson, so let there be uneducated opinion.  perhaps they were simply egged along my the newspaper's reporter to share their story to the community, and they truly did not wish to capitalize on the incident. yet, i nonetheless cite this event as an implication of the selfish mindset of many americans during tragic events -- the impulse to grab their undeserved 15 minutes of fame and hog whatever insignificant wattage of spotlight they can muster for themselves. why is it that when somebody dies in an egregious manner, be it by murder or automobile accident or whatever, that their  survivors  feel this is an excuse to get their name on the front page of the local section? in essence they are using the suffering of others for their own self-indulgence, and it is wrong. it is undeserved fame. and if you look at the root of this specific sin, it has spread across our society like a plague.   slave reparations. (aka fucktard topic #1) reality television. class-action lawsuits. (aka fucktard topic #2) affirmative action. (aka fucktard topic #3) hell, even welfare is a relevant example of this "free lunch" mentality that so many people share. dammit, people have to deserve what they earn. all people at their core can be strong, intelligent, independent individuals. there are so many kids living in the "ghettoes" of society who are living full lives, supporting their families, gaining knowledge (for themselves, if not the report card), and expressing their artistry (graffiti art, bboying, freestyling, etc.), even as they are pigeonholed into the stereotype of ignorant, intolerant, unmotivated adolescents.   i would bet you my life (no, not really) that this american way of thinking will never change -- we as a society glorify individualism to a nigh-unhealthy degree. (yes! a way to transition into calling michael moore a sanctimonious asshole without having to create another pointless, rambling post!) the status quo will for evermore remain the status fucking quo. but it would clear my mind just a bit if these americans could realize that you don't need to be quoted in the 6 o'clock news to validate your existence.
