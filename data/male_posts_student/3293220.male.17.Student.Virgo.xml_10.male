Not a great surprise as the article itself, as a complete fabrication, was libellous.  However, the removal did not occur before WebIndia [not-linked, libellous] had picked up on the article, republishing it without checking its validity.  This is one of the most upsetting stories to be published.  To quote the articles,  "According to a report in 'The Mirror', a senior teacher has been booted out and two more suspended from Winchester College. Allegations of misconduct, sparked by the initial discovery of web porn, have also been made against staff.  Meanwhile, headmaster Tommy Cookson has confirmed a teacher has been kicked out from his 80,000-pounds-a-year post and two teachers have been suspended."  Where to begin.. First of all, a senior  teacher  was not booted out.  The man in question was a manager, the head of IT, who taught perhaps 3 or 4 hours a week (and had only been here for 3-4 years).  He left, or was forced to leave (however one wants to look at it) simply because he was no longer fulfilling the job description with which he was tasked.  This was to oversee the spending of millions of pounds of IT donation - a task happily fulfilled I'm sure - and ensure a smooth running of the network, with adequate security, etc.  As a manager he only partially succeeded.  The school  urlLink website  was done, and the money was spent networking the entire campus, upgrading the school servers, buying new computers, and so on (how would you spend your IT millions?!).  However, the network was certainly not stable (especially during weekends), and security was particularly lax.  This lead to the leaking of the price-fixing stories to the press.  As a manager (and not a teacher) he would have earned a manager's salary c.£80,000(accurate figure).  The average teacher, even a relatively senior one, would earn significantly less than this figure.  Finally, the head of IT left several days before this article was published, and before the story was leaked to the press: the two events are therefore unconnected.   The scotsman  urlLink article  is perhaps most accurate, noting:  "A parent of one boy at the college said rumours were rife over why the staff had been suspended, but he did not believe it had anything to do with conduct involving pupils"   Glad someone noticed that this particular investigation is not in the same league as the Metcalfe affair  "He [T Cookson] said: “Two masters have been suspended pending an investigation. This is a confidential staff matter and standard practice.”" Now we look at the alleged reasons given for the dons' suspension.  The press claim that pornographic websites were accessed, the school make no comment.  Must be a conspiracy theory, I hear you shout.  Well, no.  After the suspension, rumours rapidly developed, with everyone having heard something from someone who heard something from someone.  Pupils were surprised at having their lessons suddenly cancelled without cover, and no word was forthcoming from the management.  Then, some genius noticed the disappearance of the same 2 dons, around the time of the head of ITs dismissal.  They considered how the two could possibly be linked, and a story was born.  Since the 23rd of March, the two teachers have remained away from school.  The pupils under their care were preparing for exams and have had their teacher removed without explanation.  An air of secrecy covers the school.  Dons don't seem to know what's going on, and if they do, they don't talk about it.  Meanwhile, the school makes no statement, which is very odd considering their fast same-day response and  urlLink press-release  to the Metcalfe  urlLink acquital .  They have been very tardy in making any comment while they perform their enquiry.  In the meantime, entire sets have been to the headmaster's office, demanding their teacher back, and an entire house has signed a petition demanding their house-tutor back.  In this instance, the teachers are popular with the boys.  The school authorities still remain silent as they continue to "investigate".  I suppose we shall have to wait for the administration to make some form of firm decision, and perhaps even reveal what it is they're investigating.   Until then the pupils wait patiently for a timely resolution to the matter, and hope for the return of two excellent teachers.
