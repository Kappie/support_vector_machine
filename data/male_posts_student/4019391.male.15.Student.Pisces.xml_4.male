Chelsea also have a russian chairman who knows as little as a 2 months old baby about football. And he only knows how to spent money on lousy player. Hai, what else can i say. Not tt i dun wish to say positive things abt chelsea but i cun think of any. Anyway, they belong in the nationwide league and shld be playing there the following season. Haha!!
