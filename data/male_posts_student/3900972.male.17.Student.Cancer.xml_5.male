Always with there ignorant questions, like "where is the main street?" you know what I do when one of these dumb bastards, who is too dumb to read a fucking map, asks me this? Send them to a whole other part of town.  I work in a big toy shop in the centre of the city, and every fucking tourist come in there, with there children. I mean why the fuck would someone take there children to The City Amsterdam? A city of hashbars on every corner, and a whole a fucking red light district. This is no place for children. Or do they want to teach them the arts of getting stoned, and paying for sex at an early age? And don't give me this, Amsterdam has got culture and history, shit. Because Amsterdam is just weed an whores. That's why I like to live here.  and of all the tourists, I hate the damn French the most. Can somebody tell me why these people refuse to learn English? It isn't that hard.  So treat tourists bad!!!
