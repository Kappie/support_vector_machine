This one is lusting after me.  Connor : Oh...no, I--I--it's just that it's the outfit. I guess I've had a thing for older women.  Angel : (under his breath) They were supposed to fix that.    Connor : Anyway...I just wanted to say goodbye. I gotta go back to my life now.  Angel : Oh...do you really have to leave? I mean, right now?  Connor : I kinda think I should. I need to take care of my parents. This isn't their world. They really don't feel safe here. You gotta do what you can to protect your family. I learned that from my father.
