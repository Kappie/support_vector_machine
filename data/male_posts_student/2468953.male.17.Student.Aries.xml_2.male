Girls and boys, holding a metal made container, and label "St. John Malaysia". Anxiety to finding some one to donate into their box.    I'm a St. John member when I was form 2. I got that experience about flag day. First of all, we got a briefing on St. John headquarters on 5.30am in the young morning. Our commander will separate us to different places for donation. Some like market, shopping mall, or residents. One thing my commander told us that I'll neverforget is "Don't come back if your box are not 3 quarter full, or you will be punished!". That was my first time to flag day, I don't even know what is 3 quarter. :-    So Igo together withmy best friend, Edwin, had gone to the morning market for donation. You can see how now a days human react. Some of them donate happily, but some of them getmad when they saw you come across.    Today, I've seen a St. John member come forward, and tell meto donate. Sure, I will. Because I experience it! So don't youfelt frustrate tothem!      urlLink St John Ambulance Australia  is a self-funding charitable organisation, active in all States and Territories, dedicated to helping people in sickness, distress, suffering or danger.
