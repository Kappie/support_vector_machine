So, let me see... to feel you in on what all has happened ssense...or is it since? Oh who cares. Anyway, to feel you in on what all has happened sense or since the last post, it was the last week of school, which was boring. I was exempt from all of my tests accept the Biology test, because the teacher is Satan. No actually, my 17 year old cousin is Satan. Well, maybe her mother is Satan. Well, there is a lot of evil whores where I live. So, things between me and Brandi got kind of wierd. We both knew that we like eachother, yet no one would do anything about it. I had been planning to do something about it for a long time, but never had the guts to, so finally, a couple of days ago, I wrote her a letter. I told her that I still liked her, and that I had a feeling that she still liked me. I asked her if we were going out, or kind of going out, or not. She hasn't answered me yet. I am still waiting, but her dog died the same day I gave her the letter. Talk about a bad omen. But, I think that was what she had been waiting to hear. In other news about my life, today, I finished a comic strip that I had to have finished by May 31st for an Art Project, for Art School. I am entering it in a contest. Hopefully, I will win. Also, I forgot to mention that I am currently writing a book. It is about a man that owns a company that is very successful. He then finds out that a crime organization is operating out of it secretly. The owner of this organization finds out about this, and plans to have him killed, but the company owner gets wise to this, so he changes his name, and joins the crime organization. He is assisted by another organization that cooperates with the FBI trying to stop the bad organization. So, the company owner really works for the good guys, but is undercover with the bad guys. He is trying to find out what the 'Master Plan' of the bad guys is too, while he is undercover. Also, he is trying to track down his new friend, who has disappeared strangely. Little does he know, she has been brainwashed and thinks she works for the bad guys. What is to become of her? What is the bad guys' 'Master Plan', and how will the good guys stop them?!?!?!? Even I don't know...yet, anyway. My friend that I haven't told you about likes to write too. She is 17, and she has written several novels, but they haven't been published. She's cool. Her name is Amanda. She likes to draw, too. She is like the female version of me! It is really wierd. She writes sad, depressing stories though. Not exciting, adrenaline pumping action thrillers. That's okay, though. So, I wonder what all I will be doing this summer. You know what, when I just typed that sentence before this one, I realized that I should keep like a diary/journal thing over the summer EVERYDAY, so I can always remember that summer. And I should post it every night on the net. That would be so cool. Right now I'm listening to Petey Pablo's "Freek-a-leak". Good song. I just burend a CD today, too. I have a CD Series that I make. It is called "My Music". I can hear the Microsoft employees screaming 'Copy-Cat' as I type this. Well, have you ever heard of MACINTOSH, Mr Gates? Can someone say MAJOR COPY CAT! WINDOWS IS THE ONE THAT IS THE COPYCAT! Anyway, what do I care? I am using a Windows Maching to type this! I'm such a hipocrite! LOL, atleast I admit it. Okay, so, this summer, I will try to write down everyday of my life starting from June 1st to July 31st. I won't do the end of May, or the beginning of August, becuse we go to school atleast a week in each of those months. So, the only TRULY FREE months are June and July. Now, I'm listening to Outkast's "Roses". Another Good song. Oh yea, back to the music thing. There is My Music, Volume 1 through My Music, Volume Seven. That is like...uh...let me do the math...a little less than 140 songs in less that 6 months. Wow. That is not very much. Oh, and speaking of music, I'm just going to say upfront that I am all for the music downloading thing. It rocks, so the RIAA can kiss my ass. Anyway, this summer will rock hopefully, and maybe the situation with Brandi will get better...and hotter. LOL. My goal for this summer is to kiss Brandi. Sense, or since, I didn't get to do it before the summer [which was my original goal], my new goal is to do it before school starts. Wish me luck, and I will see YOU on June 1st, if all goes to plan. Later, and stay kewl B-) [Like Me!] LATER!
