Sitting down fondling with the keyboard. Rhadji had to push everybody around and do something. anything. it was very obvious he was nervous. then came my turn. i swear i felt as if i needed to visit the toilet just 0.24125 seconds before we were up. but shafi beat me to the toilet.   oh i must say, spending bombs on a baby grand piano and not looking after it is as good as getting a digital piano/clavinova. the heater is not even swtiched on, this after spending "lots of money"(or so ive been told) to repair the once broken power chord. so what i got was a crapload from the piano. but. nevertheless, i swear we were good. haha. one might say thats because they didnt hear what i was playing. which is quite good actually, considering i made tons of double notes and mis-cue-ing haha. though i think mr NG heard..    ever heard of the stretch of road from tampines JC(A) all the way to the very 1st bus stop in pasir ris(B)? yea? id say its ard 1km?1.5? yea what ever. now imagine being stuck in a bus for 45mins from A to B. 45F**king mins. (when calculated, it'll be 2km/h.which is very very slow. a lame(lame as in legless. not lame as in heikal lame) person would obviously be so much faster) little mister gahmen(or so being known as the Government, then again, its the LTA for this instance) had to "straighten" the stretch of road just inside pasir ris, and slow down traffic.  i duly sympathise with whichever poor soul who was in a taxi at the same time and at the same place. imagine being stuck with a bill of $25 when a normal taxi ride would have cost no less than $4. and walking from one stop to the next was soooo much faster. but it was a very nice and pleasurable longest bus ride on the shortest road ive ever had. :D
