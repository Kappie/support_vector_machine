(If you're wondering why the title is so longwinded, you obviously don't know me very well... give it time.) Our goal is to make this a place where you can come to listen to people sit on their asses and complain about the issues that you sit on YOUR ass and complain about! Because I cannot lean any further right, politically speaking, without falling over and hurting myself, I've decided to get together with my liberal friend, Matt Collette, to create this publication. Only Fox News - one of the most middle-of-the-road TV stations ever secretly controlled by Ronald Reagon - has been able to provide such fairness and balance up to this point in time.   Some of you may be wondering why I'm writing an introduction to this website when my colleage has already done so. The reason is that his introduction sucks. First of all, he was very informal. Now don't get me wrong - I'm all for an informal publication. But in an editorial there is a certain professionalist feel that needs to be given. Second of all, he keeps calling this a "blog". I know that that is the technical name for this type of website, but we are merely using this form to create an online magazine.   I told him these things, and told him that he should fix it, though really I was thinking that I should have been the one to write it, anyway - I am, after all, the Editor in Chief. He suggested that I write my own if I wish, as it would showcase our differences. Well, I guess in that we have succeeded, for you can already see that he is wrong and I am right. That, I imagine, will be the general tone of this publication.   For those of you who don't know me well, I am infamous for these online writings for two reasons: one, I do not update them frequently; and two (and this is the biggie), I have been known to offend people. The last time I attempted something like this, I ended up having to fend off an entire army of skateboarders. If you want a lesson in the benefits of joining a union, go ask the skateboarders - trust me, those mothers can band together like Baptists at a Catholic boarding school.   Well, I suppose that I should wrap this up shortly. Please - check back often for updates. We plan on discussing a hot issue from two points of view - Matt's and my own - on at least a weekly basis, and will be adding personal updates frequently, too. We may even pull in some guest writers, if we don't scare everyone away too fast. Most importantly to note is that we have no idea what direction we're going with this, so not only do we welcome your input, but we probably will need it if we want to save ourselves from looking like asses.   And remember - if there's an issue that needs to be discussed, we'll be "ON TOP" of it. And hopefully without too many lame, cliche jokes and taglines.   Thanks for reading.   - Corey Prachniak  "Editor in Chief"  AKA Right Wing Nut Job
