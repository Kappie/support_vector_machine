So, anyway, this weekend, I'm home doing nothing! I think I'm going to the movies today with Stephanie, but I'm not sure.  So, yesterday, I was so bored. I was online all day and reading my summer reading book which I finished in 1 day. I hated it, it was horrible! So, now, I'm just hanging out, waiting for Stephanie to get home so I can call her about the movies. We're eather going to see The Village (that looks awsume!) or Anchorman, which i don't really want to see, but I will go to it if I have to.      Anyway, I'm so bored. I wish I was here--->(Canobie Lake Park, the picture wouldn't work :() with Mia instead of home!
