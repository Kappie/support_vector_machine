Its truly a great feeling you have when you teach someone as young as 5 to do a Kung Fu technique. They hit hard, yell loud and then have a wicked mean face all at the same time. Then you say, "Okay, relax." Their face lights up with a smile. =D I love it.  I'm also in charge of teaching brand new students (who never took martial arts) Kung Fu as well. I love it when they get all into the technique and their face lights up and you can tell that they are thinking, "This is so cool!" I love it.  As an instructor I'm also in charge of working out. Tonight we (all the other instructors) have seminar nights where we spar and play push hands. Tonight was a conditioning night. We have our annual instructor tournament coming up in two weeks so we have to be in shape for it. We did a couple bag workouts (kicking, punching, and kneeing the bags, oh ya about 2-3 minutes each). Then after all this is said and done we have to run 2 miles and beat our previous time. My time was 16:47 that I had to beat. My friend Leo was 16:27 (I think) but anyways, my Sifu told us that if we all beat our time tonight then we don't have to run this Saturday for the make up times that other people didn't beat. But, if one person doesn't beat their time then everything doubles... Basically, double or nothing. So we debated and then thought... If we are instructors, and we push our students all the time... Why the hell not! LET'S DO IT! So... We run like hell! I was thinking in my head the whole time "Just 20 seconds behind Leo!" "No worries!" I caught up to him and started to yell " C'mon Leo! I need you up here bro!" We finished our 2 miles in 15:47. Man... I walked back to help some of the other instructors push and we did it. None of us have to come in this Saturday.Its days like this when I feel the best about my fellow instructors. I know they have my back no matter what happens.  I know now that I have only 11 more days until the tournament. I have to remember, "While your not training, someone else is training to kick your butt!" Bring it.
