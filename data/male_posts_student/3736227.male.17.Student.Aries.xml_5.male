Anyway, with Annie now out of y life forever, I guess, things have changed. I no longer spend time looking for her, and very rarely think about her. I trynot o cause it hurts so much. I have been spending a lot of time with Brian as usual, but someone new has come into my life. A new friend: Alan. He is a nice guy, and I find it hard to completely connect with him, for fear that he will one day be taken from me. I guess it is the same with all my friends...I get close enough to them where I know them, but stay far away enough to know that if we ever fight, they die, or move away, or we just drift apart, I know that I will not get completely bent out of shape. Sorry guys, but that's reality. Alan, Brian, and I are spending a lot of time together, adn it's great. Last night, we stayed at his house and watched Tank Girl. One of Brian's favorites. I remember the first time we watched it, we laid on the couch, and he held me almost the entire time:) That was great. So now, I am sitting on the computer, searching for the right words. It is hard to put into words how I feel right now. My mind is all jumbled and I can't find the path I need to stay on. Hopefully, mom won't go to Kent on Saturday and Brian and I can spend some time at the lake or something before we go see Alan at work. Arabica has become like a second home to me. It's quiet, there are friends, and I can spend time with Brian and Alan. Those two have become almost my whole life. Brian more than Alan, but even though I haven't known Alan quite as long, I feel a certain kinship to him. However, we couldn't be more different. Anyone who knows me, knows that I am a little preppy. Alan is not. But it's nice to talk to him, and we connect on a lot of different levels. Our time will be cut short though, when his bf -to-be comes back from Michigan. There will be a drastic change, because I don't know how Calvin will take to Alan hanging out with me and Bri so much. Go figure, however I have told many people this..."I am not going to do what he wants e to do. If I want to hang out with you, then I will. The only way I'll back off, is if you tell me to." Sara, you know this. Anyway, let's hope that Alan feels the same way on that, or our friendship is doomed to end at an early stage. Well, everything is going alright with me and Brian. I have decided to start taking my lexapro again, just because I am getting progressivly snappier, and don't want to hurt Bri one of these times. I guess I am going to go for now...      Brian I love you so much      Valandil
