Well we had everybody but the Mosses stay at our house the night before just in case we had to get to the theater real quick. We got there at 7 am and stood inline for three hours. That by itself was great, then we got to go in the theater and sit down and wait for three more hours. But that was great we had soo much fun. Seeing the movies again in the theater with friends was awesome and then came the Return of the King! Oh wow that was good... I even cried. Oh and now it's all over, all that waiting and now it's gone. Well we'll have to do it again, maybe if Peter Jackson comes out with the Hobbit? So yeah I'll have great memories of that day for years and years to come. Well that's enough ranting for now. L8r.  "That still only counts as one!" wow Legolas sure can rack em up!
