Thierry Fr√©maux, the festival's artistic director, told today's (Tuesday) New York Times that it was the longest ovation he had ever witnessed at Cannes. Meanwhile, the Times reported that instead of making a deal with a single distributor, Miramax chiefs Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein are attempting to put together a consortium that would ensure the anti-Bush documentary the widest theatrical release possible. Times critic A.O. Scott called Fahrenheit "the best film Mr. Moore has made so far, a powerful and passionate expression of outraged patriotism. ... Is it partisan? Of course. But there are not many important films that haven't been." Desson Thomson in the Washington Post called it "the film to beat" in the festival's competition. "What's remarkable here isn't Moore's political animosity or ticklish wit. It's the well-argued, heartfelt power of his persuasion," Thomson concludes. Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News confessed that she was "in tears" after watching the movie. "As annoying and outrageous as he can be, he has the guts and talent to tie together various aspects of the post-9/11 era in a way that makes you question many things," she wrote. Peter Bradshaw commented in Britain's Guardian newspaper: "It was strident, passionate, sometimes outrageously manipulative and often bafflingly selective in its material, but Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 was a barnstorming anti-war/anti-Bush polemic tossed like an incendiary device into the crowded Cannes festival." However, the Hollywood Reporter commented that the film offers "no debate, no analysis of facts or search for historical context. Moore simply wants to blame one man and his family for the mess we are now in." And Lou Lumenick in the New York Post described the film as an "incredibly superficial and misleading treatment. ... Far from [being] the political hot potato ... Fahrenheit 9/11 is more like a lot of hot air." "
