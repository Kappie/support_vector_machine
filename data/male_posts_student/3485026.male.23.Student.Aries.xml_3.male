But the class I am in now, The Legal Process, is by far the most bring class I have ever taken.  The reading is horrendous, like reading a Math textbook where it gives you the problems then the answer right after it, so there is no thinking involved, like a book is lecturing.  Then to make matters worse, in class we rarely cover anything that is not in the book, so we just end up repeating the textbook.  The only time we leave the text is when the professor points us to some article or review that he is written and what his thesis is.  And, if you have a question, you will never get called on.  Last class, a guy had his hand up for 20 minutes, the professor looked right at him while he was lecturing, and kept going and never stopped to see what the question was.  This summer I have gained experience with two new professors at the school, and I am not impressed with either, I actually rearranged my schedule for the fall and spring so I could avoid taking them.  My professors during my first year were all really good at teaching, with mixing lecture and questions, and did an excellent job in relating the relevant material.  These two professors this summer lack all of those characteristics.  Anyway, enough of the complaining.  Lately, I was surfing randomly over the web and came upon information concerning the Baha'i faith.  I was really fascinated by what I read and learned, and found that much of what they believe relates to things I have thought about in the past.  I especially liked the concept of continual revelation through the "manifestations" of all of the major religions.  I also liked the concept of breaking down the barriers between people and working towards actual unity in the world and justice for every human being.  They also provided this free download of a library that has roughly 1,000 texts from various religions.  The majority of the texts are from the Baha'i faith, but there was literature from Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and more, and it is an awesome tool to research different concepts of the religions and be able to quickly compare them to each other.  I plan on doing so more research into the Baha'i faith, probably not to adoption, but probably similar to my relation to Buddhism, where I read the literature and embrace the ideas within the framework of my own spirituality and beliefs.  In the spirit of my inquiry into the Baha'i faith, here is a short excerpt from a Compilation concerning Scholarship within the Baha'i faith:  "Knowledge is one of the wondrous gifts of God.  It is incumbent upon everyone to acquire it.  Such arts and material means as are now manifest have been achieved by virtue of His knowledge and wisdon which have been revealed in Epistles and Tablets through His Most Exalted Pen - a Pen out of whose treasury pearls of wisdom and utterance and the arts and crafts of the world are brought to light. Knowledge is as wings to man's life, and a ladder for his ascent.  Its acquisition is incumbent upon everyone.  The knowledge of such sciences, however, should be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth, and not those which begin with words and end with words.  Great indeed is the claim of scientists and craftsmen on the peoples of the world...In truth, knowledge is a veritable treasure for man, and a source of glory, or bounty, of joy, of exaltation, of cheer and gladness unto him."
