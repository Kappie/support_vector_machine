In the present life, this is very impossible but in the future this is so possible. It is very useful to the students and to the teachers as well. If the students are far from where the Digitalia is, they can teleport to the room by using Teleportus. As for the teachers, if they want to go to places, they can just use this innovative and incredible device to go to their destination with just a push of a button.
