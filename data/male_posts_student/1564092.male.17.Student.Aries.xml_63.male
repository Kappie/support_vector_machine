The lady had to stick these electrode things all over my head and neck with this really sticky jelly stuff. I couldn't sleep more then five hours last night or eat or drink anything with sugar or caffeine which basically meant I couldn't eat or drink anything except bread and water. That took a good part of my afternoon but I went to Starbucks afterward so I guess that was alright. I'm not going to type anymore cause if I did it would get me in to trouble at the moment. Later.    CURRENT SONG:  I Want To Live - Josh Gracin Â• urlLink  iTunes
