I think this proves eisegesis can extend beyond the Bible.    1.   Rick : “Here’s looking at you, kid.”   Sometimes a man finds the right words to endear his girlfriend, and Rick nails it perfectly with this line.  Granted, I’m not as smooth as Rick, but I’ve had some good moments.  These moments are dedicated to this quote!   2.   Ivonne : “Where were you last night?”   Rick : “That was so long ago, I can’t remember.”   Ivonne : “Will I see you tomorrow?”   Rick : “I never make plans that far ahead.”   Rick always knows the smoothest lines in how to deal with women who are constantly nagging him.  It goes without saying that I need to have a whole stock of these lines too.   3.   Capt. Renault : “And what in heaven’s name brought you to Casablanca?”  Rick  “My health.  I came here for the waters.”  Renault : “Waters? What waters? We are in the middle of the desert.”  Rick  “I was misinformed.”   This describes how I felt at Baylor.  I came for promised goods, only to discover I was misinformed.   4.  Renault : “Rick is the kind of man, if I were a woman, and I weren’t around, I should be in love with Rick.”   This is one of those unplanned homosexual moments in classic movie history.  God only knows how many of these types of Freudian slips have fallen out of my mouth throughout my life.   5.  Rick : “Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine. . .”   This classic line fits my life in two ways.  First, it seems that I can’t avoid my ex-girlfriends.  Whenever I accidentally run into one of them, I always think of this line.  Second, in a positive way, I say this line when I accidentally meet someone beautiful and wonderful beyond all my expectations.  I wonder, why am I so lucky?   6.  Rick : “How long was it we had, honey?”  Ilsa : “I didn't count the days.”  Rick : “Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one.  A wild finish.  A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides had been kicked out.”   This quote memorializes the one time my heart truly got broken.  Like Rick, I totally fell head over heels for a girl who broke my heart in a terrible way.  I can’t think of a better description for this feeling than “a guy . . . with a comical look on his face because his insides had been kicked out.”   7.  Strasser : My impression was that he was just another blundering American.  Louis : We mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they blundered into Berlin in 1918.   This exchange between two Germans reminds me of what atheists are saying about Christian philosophers today.  As Christians continue to increase throughout the discipline, some non-Christians have the attitude that we are just more blundering Christians.  A great reply to this would be “We mustn’t underestimate Christian blundering.  I was there when Plantinga’s blunder solved the logical problem of evil, when Swinburne explicated a successful probable argument for God’s existence, when Craig presented a cogent cosmological argument, when van Inwagen decisively refuted compatibilism . . .”   8.  Rick : “Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean - what you're fighting for?”  Laszlo : “You might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.”   This is great quote from the movie.  In some ways, I identify my calling in Christian apologetics, philosophy, and ministry to have this kind of impetus.  By the way, movies nowadays don’t say powerful things like this any more because it would be overtly pro-war.  Try this as a fun game: try to imagine what current liberal players in Hollywood would say during in World War II.   8.  Rick : “We'll always have Paris.”   . . .and I’ll always have Texas. . .   10.   Rick : “This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”   This is my attitude in Michigan.  The prospects for collaboration in acts of mischief and tomfoolery seem to be good here.  Yes, this does seem like the beginning of a beautiful friendship . . .
