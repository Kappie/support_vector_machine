Put an arcade in there, a really good snack bar (or at least some vending machines), Public internet terminals and a play area for the kids.  Imagine the difference if instead of "Now I have to go back to the BMV..." It was "Now we get to go back to the BMV!! I'm so excited!" Seriously is there some goverment rule that says BMV's have to be drab and dreary?  Everyone hates going there so much and it's something that wouldn't be hard to do. In case you haven't figured it out, I got my permit today.  In fact that's all I did, since it took me, all in all, about six hours.  Yeah. After that we drove around the parking lot, where I concluded that driving is not nearly as easy as it looks. And on the way home we listened to a tribute to Ray Charles, including his unique version of the song "Imagine": "Imagine all the people (All the little people)  Living... Living there whole lives.. just for today..." What a guy.  Well that's all I have to say.  Oh, also Micheal, could you link me to your West Wing script site cause I'm lazy? Thanks. I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!
