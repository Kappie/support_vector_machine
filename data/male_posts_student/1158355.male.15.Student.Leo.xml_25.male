I can bend spoons. Basic shit like that. Easy stuff. I got this cool Matrix desktop and screen saver, they both are like kick ass awesome. I also downloaded every song from the soundtrack. Now I have my own countdown for how many days until MATRIX: RELOADED comes out! AHH! Animatrix is cool. Revolutions isn't coming until November. Woah, why do you people care? You aren't Matrix fans like I am. I even made my own religion/belief on the Matrix. I KNOW ALL!
