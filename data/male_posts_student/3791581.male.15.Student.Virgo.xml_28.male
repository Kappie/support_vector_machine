But Toronto is still  home home  I suppose.  Alot has changed - where the heck did that Bank of America building come from?  And there are new luxury condos every time you turn around.  There are a few more homeless people sleeping in front of City Hall than I remember.    Some friends from New Jersey made the drive back and spent the weekend here with us.  Of course we took them to Niagara Falls.  We did the Maid of the Mist tour - my first time ever believe it or not!  I caught some great digital which I'll post soon.    This city is beautiful and CLEAN!  But its going to take me some time to get used to the 15% sales tax.  Ouch!  I'll definitely need a job to afford myself here.  Hee!
