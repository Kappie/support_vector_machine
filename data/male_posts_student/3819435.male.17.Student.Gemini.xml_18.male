Because you have reached the point where a month is such a small percentage of your total relationship time. Plus, I don't like hearing about it  every single month . I am happy for you, but I think it may be a little more special if it is by the half year. Then, I will be able to say, "Wow, it's been a year and a half already? My, how time flies."   Done with that topic. Now to Chase's question: The best gift people give their loved ones is in their personality. If they are a bitch to most people, they'll be sweet to their lover, if the don't talk much to most people, they'll never stop with their lover. True or False?  Well, I agree, but then I don't. I believe that they act differently tho their loved one, but not necessarily all the time. Let's say a person is with  only  their loved one. Then, I agree with you. They will act kinder and sweeter and gentler. But, if the person is with their loved one  and  someone else is around too, they will act totally different. I dont' know if it is to impress their friend, but they say things and may even be cruel to their "loved one." Now, for some people it is the same when friend are around, but that is because they are not afraid to let their friends know how they feel or act towards their "loved one." I hope you understood. That is my experience in these things.
