"My Girlfriend's Shower Sucks"  The temperature changes It chills me to the bone It makes me wish that I was cleaning myself at home  It makes me grumpy and sometimes I lose hope The water's hard, so I can never rinse the soap  and it's got no pressure The water dribbles down on me and it's got no pressure It's like the shower's going pee   ================================  then i get out, sort of dry myself and put my clothes on inside the bath. then... (sigh) i get the news that my little cousin is coming over (today was my nintendo/tv only day sortof) and so i really get down. to couple that, a friend (oh yeah, call me a friend, you only care about me when you can use me, asshole) calls me so that "we" can  play need for speed and shoot stuff with his newly acquired (two days ago) rifle. so i have to get him over. argh. then i help my grandma put a curtain and then... uh... i watch tv/play nintendo, i dont remember which. oh no, wait, before playing nintendo/watching tv i spend like 10 mins sitting on the couch thinking about someone who i dont recall who it was. o.O THEN i play nintendo. its more like: THEN i connect my nintendo. after connecting it, my cousin gets here and my day is thrown into oblivion. then my friend gets here (after like 20 mins of playing a tonka game on the pc). "we" play nintendo while i watch my cousin. then we go out with my cousin to shoot some coke cans. well, fanta cans. i discovered them today, now that i come to think about it. my cousin is afraid of the dog, so my asshole "friend" tells my cousin to run away from the dog. the dog obiously chases him, jumps on my cousin, my cousin falls on some metal, and the dog bitewes him. even if hes like totally wasted, my friend STILL encourages my cousin to run. i felt like shooting his ass with the rifle, but what the heck. i scare away the dog and poick up my cousin. my friend is laughing. i really dont want to see him right now. after wasting like 20 pellets/thingies, we go up again and play nintendo. i felt bad for my cousin cuzz my friend wouldnt stop being an asshole to him (apart from getting angry at a 4 year old because he cant play nintendo, you fag) so he makes my cousin's day a piece of crap, and i feel really bad and i want to punch my friend. but i cant, so i just let it slip and try to play with my cousin. i ignore my friend. then he asks me (my friend) if i want to go over to his house for sleeping over. i tell him that i have to go to the dentist tomorrow, and that i dont like sleeping over. reasons? reasons:  1- its not my bed 2- its NOT a bed 3- its not my bathroom 4- re-read lyrics. 5- i cant sleep tight, or dream about nice things, or any other thing you do while sleeping. 6- once i was taking a bath, and the dude just walks in, opens the shower, and shoots a gun. yes, im naked. yes, im seen. and yes, he stares.  so there you have your reasons.  then, uhm... he tells me that i should be thankful that he is iviting me and that im a bad friend. you wouldnt imagine how much i care. so he just goes sad/angry/silent/retarded (i dont know which) with me for the rest of the day. once again, i ignore him. then my cousin tries to get attention by bothering us and begs for me to play nintendo with me (he doesnt like playing with my friend, because he kicks his ass and tries to make him lose. me on the other hand, i just sit with the controller on my lap, eyes closed, and wait till my cousin tells me i can move.) then my grandma asks us not to play with the rifle. my friend gets even more pissed off/faggot-ish when my cousin tells him he doesnt want to play with him because he beats him up. my "friend" spends the day of the day angry at my cousin and i just sit there staring at my gramp. then i go pee. then i come back and sleep. then someone wakes me up by throwing the controller at my balls. guess who. my "friend" so i just pray and hope he goes early and my prayers are heard: he gets so angry he almost starts crying and asks for a fone for his mom to come pick me up. i mean he. duh. oh yeah, well ill use the 'backspace' on another oportunity. he gets angry and has an angry face (its sorta really bad acted i guess either that or he's really deformed cuz it looks like upside down 'scream' movie dude) and doesnt talk to ppl. not even my gramps. so after being completley convinced that he is, indeed gay, my cousin's parents arrive to come pick him up. along with my father, who i ask to take me home (followed by some bad jokes of my friend like: youre such a bad friend [look who's talking] why arent you thankful that i invited you? ohh but baaaaby doesnt have his little blanket and he doesnt sleep in his cute little bed and he doesnt bath in his cute little bathroom [no its not my little blanket, its a piece of your damn rags, no its not my cute little bed, its a damn piece of cloth im sleeping on, its not even a sleeping bag you cold-hearted greedy bastard, and FINALLLY, ITS NOT MY FREAKIN CUTE LITTLE BATHROOM, ITS A JAIL SHOWER, BUT I CAN AT LEAST KNOW THAT NO ONE WILL COME TO SEE MY DICK WHILE I CLEAN MYSELF, YOU PIECE OF GAY ASS PRICK]) after a while he leaves, and i get glad he's gone (my friend) and so i show the bed to my father and he asks me how the hell can i sleep on that. then my grandpa comes in and tells me that that is probably why his back hurt. then my uncle comes and lets out a big laugh. then my grandma comes and asks me why didnt i tell her anything. then my aunt comes and says the 'oh-poor-kid-im-going-to-cry' sermon. then my cousin jumps on the bed, bouinces off and breaks his neck. no not really, but he comes in, jumps on the bed, and makes a face that says 'ow' on his forehead.then i pack up my stuff, say bye, look at my uncle's new car (which has those windshield wipers on the front lights, which is pretty cool, but i dont know why would he want that) and leave. then i get here and write this.  im going to wait to see if i get to do something for the rest of the day. bye bye
