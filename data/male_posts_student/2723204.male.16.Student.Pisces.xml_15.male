Lonely Valentine's     Till the 16th valentine, a cynic I was, Till she came, a heart of stone I possessed. Together with the lonely, company I had. Great company they were, but emptiness still resides. Hurt was my soul, when you left me alone. Watching the waves with the lonely, Threading the sand with them, but when can I? When can I spend this day, this day, with only you and I?  A lonely, lonely valentine I always had. But this loneliness seemed to be amplified. Through your absence, through your callousness. For my Love, none had tasted, but yours, many had. An understatement indeed, to say I did feel sad. Depression creeps up to me, and solitute I dread. All I want is to spend my 17th with you, and only you........  Alone.........
