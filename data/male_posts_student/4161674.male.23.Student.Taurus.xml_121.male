       
      This is a team We need to work as one. Our focus, funtion and motivation centered on the center.  This is a team Not a solo act With middlemen, hucksters and clowns Hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder Strong and commanding.  This is a team But my burden seems too heavy My input isn’t equaling what my output should be.  My team needs to pick me up, Carry me to the sidelines Allow me to rest by the Gatorade cooler…  This is my team, my life, and my hope. Cover my back while I catch my breath.
