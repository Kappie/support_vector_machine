What GOOD is there in "track ..AND field" anyways? Physical activity? Fun? The joy of participating? Competition? I don't think soo. Keep the ribbon making people in business? Yes. But that's no good. No good at all.  The forecast for tommorow is just perfect and it couldn't get any better. Thanks for nothin' you dumb weather..  Oh yes, The Simpsons is on tonight.
