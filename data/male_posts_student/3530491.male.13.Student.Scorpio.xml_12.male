Anyway, on the way to the movie theater, we stopped at the drive-through of a downtown McDonald's. We were waiting for about 10 minutes while the guy at the last window was just sitting there. Finally, the cars start to move, and when we get to the window, they give us our food and 2 free meal coupons because the car ahead of us (the one before the one at the last window)was trying to use counterfeit money. The guy in the car at the last window was nice enough to wait there, thus boxing in the counterfeiting car. They also gave us our order for free (take note that I'm far from poor), which is nice. On the way towards the movie theater, while I'm handing everyone their orders, I realize something: They forgot a straw with my drink. Eh, figures.
