If you're a regular "Duct Tape and Gum Bands" reader you already know that John Kerry is married to Teresa Heinz, owner of the company that makes Heinz Ketchup.  So every time you squirt Heinz Ketchup on your hot dog, you're supporting John Kerry for president!  How can I stop funding the Kerry campaign and still enjoy ketchup on my fries you ask?  There is an alternative.   W Ketchup!   W Ketchup is  made in the USA  (Heinz has as many foreign factories as they do varieties, 57) from  all US grown ingredients  (Teresa, can you say "Viva La Mexico?").  Stop supporting the Kerry Ketchup Company!   urlLink Click here to order your W Ketchup today!   As an added bonus, a portion of the proceeds from each bottle of W Ketchup goes to the Freedom Alliance Scholarship Fund.  This fund helps children, whose parents are on active duty in the US military.
