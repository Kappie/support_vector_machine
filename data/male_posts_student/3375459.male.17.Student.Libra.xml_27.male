I realized I had been slacking too much, and my footwork got all messed up. Even my aiming sucks, standing under the hoop doing the same action (catching the rebound and shooting) three times before I actually score a point. But something never change, I was still doing my ‘break-dance’ fall and recovery. I rather fall the correct way, then to balance myself and hurt my ankles again.   For the next five games, I got back my scoring feeling and footing. With a nice combination of players, and team work with Linus  Zeng Yuan, we won five games in a row in a 3 on 3(losers out) match. Now how sweet is that? But having played six games in a row to start off the day, I was all worn out. We took a rest and its back to the game again.  Then Tara showed up with her charming smile =), that made me walked away from the on going game (HAha.. that's not the real reason I walked out of the game lah). Passed her prize sketches to her, at the same time I got the One Piece figurines form her. Next, she passed me her donation card with her birthday pen (am I right?) asking me to donate. Running through my wallet, I only managed to find a two dollar note and a lot of coins. I’m so sorry to had only donated two dollars. You must be cursing me by now =x. And sorry again for not helping you ask the guys, but I don't think they will donate anyway. And another sorry for the ball that almost hit you. So having no more donors, she left to collect her passport. And the games went on.  It’s terrible I say. I got a karate chop from Kah Loong the ‘Back Belt’ at my neck. Then there was a sandwich squeeze in between him and Liuns in mid air. Arrrhhh... My aching back. Next, I accidentally hit the ball into Amos's face and the rebound hit my finger tips head on, which should be the reason my knuckles are swollen now. Time passed by and all of us were too tired to carry on playing, so it’s off to the mee pok stall we used to go for lunch. Chitchat and gossip a little... and it was time to say bye bye.  After a nice shower back at home, I assembled the two figurines I got from Tara. This feels like when I’m much younger buying those $0.50 Doraemon box, $1.00 Tora box and $3.50 boxes of candy toy from econ mini mart. But I never did finish collecting the full set of $3.50 toys back then, because it took me so long to save up that the stock ran out. Oh well, now at lease I know there are two shops at sunshine plaza selling these One Piece figurines. Hopefully they don't run out of stock again *fingers crossed*. While unpacking the box, I tot the figurines were just one solid item, that was until I popped Zorro’s big head off while trying to get him out of the wrapper through a small hole I made. HEhehee... His alright, don't worry. I still am impressed with the detailed paintings. I’m so very sure it was all done by hand, they must be. It was high up with some of my gundam on the top shelve (how stupid can I get, I can even see them), but later I took them down and placed them next to my sister's collection Pooh Bear figurines. There was this star-shaped, chocolate coated biscuits thingy that came in the box, I had no idea what it was, but it’s not puffed rice of sure. Watched some anime and took an afternoon nap.   Lao Da returned from work with a blocked nose and ears (I think it’s because she blew her nose too hard), she's really not feeling too well cause it was hurting her a lot just to breath through her mouth. She took her pills and when to bed. Mum and Dad's aren’t behaving like themselves because of Lao Da, so get well soon.
