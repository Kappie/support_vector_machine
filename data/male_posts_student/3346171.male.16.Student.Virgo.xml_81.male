Yesterday ( fryday), we (  me, adam, natália, her sister and Júlia ) went to the mall, i know i know i know, you must think that we go to the mall everyweek and "yes",  it's true!  We went to the movies, we i mean... natália and her sister couldn't go, because her sister wasn't allowed to get in. We watched " Hell boy ", it's about  a portal that a friend of Hitler opened and the Devil would control the world, but a cristian guy found the Devil when it was a baby, there are some other monster.   The movie is not good, it seems to have special effects, it doesn't have much though.    And the story is not good.  After the movies we met the girl and Natália's mom took her friend home.   We ordered a   "Maracanã" Pizza   ( Maracanã is a soccer stadium, from my sourses it was the biggest stadiun on earth so is the pizza), we ate a l-o-t! Then we ate fundue of chocolate, YUMMY. And we checked some tennis shoes ( i dribbled for all, but i know that dad will not buy me one), and we went to Lei Básica ( cring), i saw a   jacket  ,  so  perfect!  so  expensive!      Then, home!
