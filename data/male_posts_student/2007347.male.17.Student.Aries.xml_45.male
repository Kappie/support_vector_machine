Anyway, after the game we went in Fishy's car (one of the randoms) and trashed a letter boxes  bin ran bins. Bin running is where your in a car and you hold on to a wheely bin and when the car gets some speed you let the bin go free, usually into someone's front yard. I don't know why but I broke about 4 letterboxes that morning. I am now known as Sally.
