(check out his phone paragraph at malex.blogspot.com) ok well i better stop writing because my crazy ex is standing outside my window with a shotgun threatening to blow my head off if i stop loving her. i told her to freakin pull the trigger already so i don't have to listen to this crap anymore. lol -steve
