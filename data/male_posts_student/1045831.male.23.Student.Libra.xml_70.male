Considering that it was the day before the fourth almost everyone I knew was out of town.  This made it rough.  Finally I got a hold of Stephanie, Younger's GF and she was heading to her bar but said we could stay with her but we had to meet her at the bar.  You know me that was a real sacrifice.  So we get to the bar and are treated to all free drinks and we were hanging out with Steph and her buddy having fun.  Then After the bar closed we hit Whataburger fora delicious breakfast burrito.  Then we went home looked at some pictures and chatted awhile.  Played with some cats and then crashed on an air mattress that she had for us.  It was a great way to end a long day in the car.  I will tell some more about the actual concert later....
