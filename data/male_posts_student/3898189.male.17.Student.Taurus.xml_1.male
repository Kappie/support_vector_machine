( That too is probably my fault) I have been obssesed with watching the complete first season of "Rocky and Bulwinkle and Friends". I have also been over playing Halo agian and am getting boared with it cause I can not seem to make it far with out dying...ON NORMAL! That is actually weird cause if I do say so myself I am pretty good at it. I have also not been able to sleep. That is kinda same ol same ol stuff though.... My current music is "Fallen away from me" by Korn... I like them. I whent through a weird period were I loved korn, then hatd them, now I like them... They have fun angery white guy music ^_^ When ever I am mad, they are one of the bands I definatly listen to, to help blow off steam.( Alnog with Slipknot, Mudvayne, and a few others that I can not remember...) So today I went to my aint Esters house to do yard work...While cutting grass I seem to have a nice felling as if I was happy cleaning and doing work. I usually do not do that. The same thing happened last night were I had a sudden urge to clean the living room so I folded cloths and cleaned up decently. My room has also been unusaully clean as well, but I am happy with that because I feel nice inside. ............I also feel a bit closer to my Dad. I think that is a good thing. I can no longer say I hate him. (that is good cause  if I hate someone that is not good cause I hate few people) If  he could just work out the whole....... yelling thing . And maybe knock on my door. That would help me out alot. I think I am emotionally scared fer life cause of my Dad's yelling. I can not stand when people yell...  Last night I also had a weird dream. It had to do with Harry Potter. I remember a horse with a clown face, and its makeup had halfmoons undernieth the Eyes... and It turned out to be Dumbledor was spying on us. (Suprise, Suprise!) The rest is a little hard to describe on line ^_^  Once again that is it for now...
