Sadly, I'm not near as patient as you, nor as kind.  I've had it!  I am SICK of you people telling me that I can't make it with her.  Shut up! OK? I know it's your opinion, but do us a favor, and keep it to yourself!  Alright, I don't EVER want to hear about it because I don't care what you think! I will make it with her, and you all will stop laughing just long enough to watch my fist come in and break your face.  So the next time you begin telling me that I can't make it with her, shut the f*ck up.  Got it??  In other news, the street cleaners of this city SUCK!  Because you can't keep the neighborhood streets clear of rocks and debris, I now have an infected knee and a sliced up chin.  Not to mention my scraped arms...  Well, if you cannot tell, I'm in a very pissed off mood right now, and I don't write well when I'm pissed off.  So, I'm gonna go. w/e...  >-Jack Sparrow-
