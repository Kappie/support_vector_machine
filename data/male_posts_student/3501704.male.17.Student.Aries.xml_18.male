After that went to macs at tanglin mall for a quick lunch.. saw a lot of crescent girls around . Then i went to holland village to meet jx and the other ppl for cell group meeting.Jx was telling me more about the holy spirit and speaking in tongues, i find it rather interesting.. hope to experience it sometime I could see that she is influenced by the holy spirit and this helps her through her problems in life.What the pastor said felt so real, it takes commitment to make things happen.. u are in a difficult situation cos god has plans for you, wants u to change your character or something.  Its probably things u havent thought of.. after all HE is ALMIGHY. After the meeting ended, i was planning to go home, but decided to follow jx with her friend jieyun to town. Hm starting from the heeren, we walked all the way to suntec city, my first time doing so on foot, along the way , we stopped by the singapore art musuem(old SJI :) and a shop selling some church stuff. Along the way, it was just chit chat and some sightseeing(churches)Dinner was at food court at suntec, at first we couldnt find it and had to ask for directions, it was shifted to another location.Hm saw chong ying and his friends, we gave our seats to them. Jing xuan then found her friend dywanne and from this point onwards, non stop bickering occurred, jieyun told me that once the two of them get together bound to quarrel. ITs very amusing actually...like watching free show, we went to macs at citilink mall where dywanne had his dinner and had to coax jx to eat some food. And the bickering continued...entertainment. After that, we went to esplanade rooftop, admiring the view.. listening to a free concert. There was some talk of some ppl getting married and who becomes the flowergirl/boy..ahem the two ppl bickering -_-"". Left the esplanade around 2200 and headed back home. Phew then its off to bed. Just something that came to my mind,treasure the ppl around you.. whether or not they like u does not matter..human life is so limited, must try to enjoy every moment.
