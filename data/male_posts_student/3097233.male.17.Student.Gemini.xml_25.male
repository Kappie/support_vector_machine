Now just to get rid of the person she -just- started dating as like a rebound. Grr... She needed to just wait a little longer... Would have been better, then I wouldn't have to figure out how to get her to leave him or him to just lose interest. Either way I'm not giving up this time on it, even if I have to drive there and tie the guy to a pole until he promises to leave the country. A little over dramatic, just 6 tads and 12 bits huh? I've known her for 5 years so I'm allowed too. Women are confusing, I'll state that again. This time maybe there is hope though? Maybe she'll be the right one this time?  How come I'm starting to sound desperate... I'm only 17.... This really doesn't sound right... lol. Just so long as we are only with each other everything is good I guess though, so that is all I have to wait for, and make sure this time it stays that way too.
