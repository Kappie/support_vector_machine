You. Yes, you. Is it nice where you stand? Do you ever find yourself drowned by the sunshine? Do you think it is a touch too hot under the glow of the spotlight? No, huh?  You like it, don't you? All the attention, all the praise, all the glory. Glory for what, you ask? Why, for being normal! For being a palatable human being. For being someone that everyone can relate to.  It's like a drug, right? A bad habit that you can never quite kick... Goodness me, did I just say "bad" habit? Ahahaha! How foolish of me! It can't be bad if only I perceive it as such after all.  Gosh, how I envy you! Look at all the faces staring at you from the crowd! They all smile like you smile; they all wear their hair just as you do; they all wear something that seems a lot like your fabulous ensemble; they mouth your lines in tandem with your lips; they move their hands in synch with yours; they see their lives being played out on the stage in front of them. Yes, I really do envy you. Everything in your world seems so... so...  ...so safe.  What's that? Oh! What of MY world, you ask? Ahahaha... You don't want to know. No no, really, I'd rather not talk about it. It's for your own good, you know. Ah, but still you persist! Oh, poppycock! All right, I will tell you a little bit about it then.  My world is nothing at all like yours. My world is enveloped by a perpetual darkness. Its inhabitants are the creatures of the night, persecuted the very moment they step on your most sacred ground. I know, I know. I make it sound horrible, don't I? It's not that bad actually; it can be rather comforting at times. Sure, it gets cold down there, and yes, I do get terribly lonely rather often, but there is something about the backstage that endears me far more than anything in your centerstage.  Can I tell you a secret? I am not at all like you. Well, at least, not in terms of how others take me. Your people accept you for who you are. You are one of them after all, so why shouldn't they? For some reason, however, I cannot be treated similarly. Honestly, it makes no sense to me. Is it my fault that I reside in the land of eternal rain? Ah, yes, that was my decision; I nearly forgot. And yet, it eludes me why this should have any bearing on them at all. Why does it matter? Forgive me, but I do not understand. (perhaps I never will... sad, isn't it?)  Even in my realm I am treated rather coldly. You see, our people are not at all alike either. My people do not always smile; their hairstyles are not always the same; their clothes are very much diverse; not all of them choose to speak; not all of them choose to move; there is no such thing as one generalization for all of their lives. It all seems so unstable, so chaotic, so volatile, does it not?  Whatever. It's home to me, and that's what counts.  Why did I choose to live here in the first place? I don't know. I just stumbled across it and liked what I saw. Everyone seemed so refreshing... so unique...  ...so different.  Frankly, everyone in your realm is so alike. I have trouble distinguishing you from that girl on the third row, or that man standing to get popcorn, or that little boy who fell asleep in the back row. You may all look different, but you don't act any different. What is this body but a vessel of the soul anyway? Everyone in here HAS to be just like everyone else. Your paths, though not exactly coinciding, cannot stray too far away from one another, because that proves you are not alone, that you are not one-of-a-kind, which is not a bad thing at all since there is safety in numbers. Right?  Call me nutty if you wish. I wouldn't disagree. The fact remains: I would rather live dangerously in my own skin than live securely in someone else's.  If only you felt the same... then, perhaps, I wouldn't have to be so alone... ------------------------------ completely wrong thought of the day: I actually learned something from my AP teacher today! Apparently, one's mind can play tricks on you to try and hide your emotions. For example, it can fool you into thinking you have forgotten about someone to try and hide the fact that you miss that person immensely. It's true! Oh, come again? How did this come up within the context of our conversation? Ah, well, err... It's funny you see OH SWEET MOTHER OF WHAT'S THAT??!? *points behind you* *bashes your head on the monitor* *runs away*
