They worship Nintendo like it's God or something, and then they bash on other video game companies like they are the spawn of Satan. They are biased to the point of blindly supporting Nintendo when it is obviously on its last legs.  The Nintendo ship is going down, and the main contributors  of TendOMFG (MariOMFG, Specialist, Nintaldo) are the stubborn captains that go down with the ship. When Nintendo finally crashes, these three will be the laughingstock of the gaming world.      The first case of their bias and unbelievable stupidity shows in their article on why Geist is better than Halo. I personally had never heard of Geist until I saw the link to their article at HBO. Their nerve to diss on one of the greatest and most innovative games in gaming history baffles me. Here is their article with my responses.      10. Bungie made Marathon, which is dumb   Marathon was actually a great game. If it wasn't, they wouldn't have made sequels. And they never specified how Marathon was dumb. This is what i like to call bias.      9. Master Chief is a boring character that never talks   The Master Chief is the last of his kind, a genetically enhanced super soldier from a top secret military project, who is forced to singlehandedly destroy the Halo 04 installation, which includes an entire Covenant armada, and the Flood. Yep, sounds boring to me. Not. He actually has a lot of dialog in the game.      8. Halo 2 has not ghosts   Not literal ghosts, but Halo 2 will have Covenant hovercraft, which are called Ghosts. These Ghosts were also in Halo CE. So bad grammar and even worse syntax aside, Halo 2  will  have ghosts.      7. Geist lets players control other bodies   Because they didn't take the time to develop a single character. Being able to control other bodies gets confusing. And what good would that do? I mean, in GTA you can steal people's cars. Thats cool. Controlling other bodies is satanic. And so are the queers that contribute to TendOMFG.      6. Geist is made by the same developers that made Mary Kate  Ashlee: Magical Mystery Mall   Now lets read through this one word at a time. Geist. Same Developers as MARY KATE AND ASHLEE. MAGICAL MYSTERY MALL. Think about it. These people say that they are guys. I don't know what they're trying to say here. My guess is either one of two things:1. Since the same developers made Magical Mystery Mall, Geist is sure to be a good game. Anyone who makes a Mary Kate and Ashlee game should be taken outside and shot. Or: 2. Since the same game developers made Magical Mystery Mall, Geist is sure to be a very, very bad game.  I mean seriously, Mary Kate and Ashlee. Think about it.     And besides, the MC is a better role model for kids. He doesn't use profanity, and he fights against satanic religious fanatics. The Olsen twins are addicted to crack. And they have an eating disorder. Now  that's  what i want to be when i grow up. (hey, hey, smell that? its called SARCASM. get used to it. punk.)      5. Halo 2 is GAY   I was not aware that any game had the ability to have a sexual preference for video games of the same gender. Therefore, this comment is null. I think what the author was trying to say was: Halo 2 is STUPID. No, you sir, are stupid. Stupid for dissing on Halo, stupid for buying a Gamecube, stupid for playing MARY KATE AND ASHLEE GAMES, AND STUPID FOR MAKING THE FREAKIN SITE IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!! their stupidity amazes me to no end.         4. Geist is a more pure first person game. Halo 2 has stupid stuff like two guns controllings and vehicles. Is it a fps or a stupid racing game? Geist is pure 100% shooter!   Halo is a more pure fps game. Geist has stupid stuff like controlling other bodies. Is it a shooter, or a FREAKING SEANCE?!?! Halo is pure 100% shooter. punk.      3. Geist looks better than Halo 2   If you like 8-bit games, yeah, Geist looks good. But in comparison to Halo 2, Geist is a finger painting, whereas Halo 2 is a da Vinci. Here are some pics to prove this statement wrong:      Geist:  urlLink http://www.gamer-talk.net/screenshots205.html    Halo 2:  urlLink http://www.bungie.net/Games/Halo2/gallery.aspx?gallery=Screenshotspage=1    Halo 2 is obviously a better looking game than Geist.      2. Geist doesn't have stupid online play. Online play is just a fad, Nintendo said so themselves. I mean who wants to play online like some PC nerd? I know I don't. Plus Xbox Live has lots of lag. My friend's friend told me that his Xbox caught on fire once.   Nyah Nyah, Nintendo this, Nintendo that BLAHDYBLAHDY-FREAKIN-BLAH!!!! There are over 1.2 million subscriptions to Xbox Live, which is expected to double when Halo 2 releases (i know i'm gettin live, and halo 2). Also, there are countless other games that incorporate online play. Consider the marvelous MechWarrior series. You can play other people online via NetMech. Definitely cool. It takes skill to maneuver a BattleMech with a keyboard and a mouse. Then you have to shoot. which adds a whole new perspective to playing. Then there is Final Fantasy. The latest installment in the FF series is basically an online game. The graphics are killer, and there are countless other people online to interact with. Online playing is    not    an online fad. It has revolutionized the way we play video games.      1. Geist sounds cooler than Halo!   Considering that i don't know how to pronounce Geist, i would still think that Halo sounds cooler. Is it pronounced like jeest? or maybe geest? or jist? or gayst? jayst? I think its pronounced like G*eye*st. or something like that. Halo is simple, and catchy. Therefore it beats Geist. End of discussion punk.
