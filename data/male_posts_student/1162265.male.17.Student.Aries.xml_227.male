I only choose to swim one event, 100 Breastroke (or is it two words?), I didn't realize up until this year how horrible my time would be for the start of the season.  It was a whopping 2:06.  To give you an idea of how bad that is, Justin (the best Breast swimmer in the county) has 1:03.  So, I was pretty nervous since I was stacked against people who were better then me.  Naturally, my Nubian powers helped, I used my pent up black rage and was able to get ahead at the start.  But being me, I've only done about four or so single events in two years (the rest were relays) so I was shocked at how quiet the pool was, either I was ahead of all these people of I had false started.  I began to panic even as I swam.  So, I convinced myself that something must be wrong, and as I did my open-turn, I stopped (foot touched the bottom) to glance down the pool.  Shit.  I would have been ahead if I hadn't flinched, I lost the lead, and had to swim like a crazy Neolithic farmer to try and gain the lead back.  I got a time of 1:40 or was it 1:38, which is almost thirty seconds better.  But sadly, I got disqualified, which I figured.  It was a learning experience though, because I never felt what it was like to be in the front, and now I know not to panic.  Crap, I'm still shaking.  I've also, been really debating with picking up some heavy ancestor worship, although I don't know how I'd get started with it.
