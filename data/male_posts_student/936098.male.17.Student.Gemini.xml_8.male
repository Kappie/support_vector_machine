About ten minutes ago Chess said, "Happy summer. Enjoying no college?" I ran into my room and slammed the door.  The class was very easy today. . . . And since I don't know where my mom is or what she wants me to be doing right now, I'm going to post about it, elaborately. The teacher was completely new, and called it "Brazoria College" on accident, and then corrected herself. The teacher seems pretty nice, but at the same time relatively incompetent. Kind of like Mrs. Munson. Except Mrs. Munson wasn't very nice.   I think that people in general are pretty fascinatingly terrible so here are some interesting and excessively detailed descriptions of the people in our class: There's a woman in our class who's probably around 30 who told the teacher a lot of terrible stuff, since we spent the whole class period talking casually. First the woman went outside for a smoke break. Then she said, "You do NOT want to see me when I haven't been smoking." And she told us about how she had been smoking since she was 14, she spent her senior year in alternative, she knows where there are whorehouses in town, she did drugs and alcohol but found them less addictive than cigarettes, and then comes the most illegal part--they started talking about police, and the woman said, "how do you think I got off my probation early? You pay off who you gotta pay off." Everyone in the class was pretty disturbed and/or alarmed by her saying that, and she said it in a very matter-of-fact way, like someone would say, "my pickup was making fun noises this morning, and then I found out the fanbelt was loose."  The kid who sat in front of us was a senior at B'port, and he said that he was going to be a pre-med student, and then he cussed a few times, talked to no one, laid his head down like a kindergartener, and walked out twenty minutes early.  There was a girl who had made a face when she was three years old, ignored her mother's warnings, and got her face stuck that way. She was looking around the room while people were talking, and for the entire class period, her face seemed to say, "why isn't anyone licking my shoes?"  The guy who sat next to Sara was really goofy. He said he was home-schooled. He had his shirt tucked in, he was unshaven, and he had pretty big glasses. He was passing around the role sheet, and he slid it into Sara's water, which fell over, and he laughed in a really goofy way.  Well, I'm done talking about those people, and I'm pretty sure that was enough to keep anyone from ever looking at this blog again. So there you go.  Sara's at work right now, and I want to help my mom (who is home now) but she's on the phone, and has been for about ten minutes.  Who thinks that Sara's blog and my blog should get married? Any opinions? You wouldn't have to read about the same day more than once. Ehh? Ehh? Okay, I give up. I'm going to find something else to do.
