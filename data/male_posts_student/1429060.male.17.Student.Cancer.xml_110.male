A white girl goes to New York and learns dancing from a black guy. Whilst doing so, they fall in love. Damn wonderful, and a superb anti-racism movie. And every scrap of dancing in that movie is beautiful. I should like to state, Sean Patrick Thomas is one of the coolest (is that cool to say anymore? cool?) guys (black or white) that I have seen, and Julia Stiles is so graceful and beautiful and I think I might worship her and ask her for divine dancing ability. God knows I need it. Well, maybe God doesn't know, but I know I need it. Anyone who has seen me dance knows. (Jessica, of the Rotary Council, knows. Sigh...passed opportunities).  Someone teach me to dance.  AP English exam from hell passed Monday, which is, incidentally, a very good thing. I'm aiming for a three. Thus, if I recieve higher, I shall be pleasantly surprised. Let's see what's next - Biology exam. On Monday. Damn. I shall be studying Sunday for that bloody thing. Especially all the "design an experiment" shit. But the rest, I can handle fairly well.  I am pretty sure that my fatigue is bettering (is that a word?). It may be from lessening the medicine from 20 to 15 mm. Or it may be from eating protein bars. Either way, I am staying awake in Biology somewhat better. Senioritis is beginning to sap my strength. Goddamnitall. I want summer.  This actually sounds rather odd, but I am beginning to want to work this summer. And not necessarily for money, just as somewhat of a daily purpose. I don't want an easy job. I strangely want to work as a waiter, or something in that category. I mean, though I want money, I don't want it to be so easy to access that it becomes monotonous. And I don't want to mow yards. Not my class of work, personally, despite the loads of cash that might flow in. Davis-Kidd or Folks Folly sounds extremely appealing.  This is actually a rather long post compared to recent blogging.  We have some stuff coming on up in English that will be time consuming. But beyond that, the weeks until school tapers off appear somewhat clean. Let's just pass the damn exams and go to sleep. I'm ready to start working as an intern geneticist.  Cheers, mortals. Let the words of wrong become the gestures of right. (What the hell did that mean?)
