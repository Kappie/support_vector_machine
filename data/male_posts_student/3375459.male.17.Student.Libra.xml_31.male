Since Wednesday, my Lao Da has been down with a fever. After her second visit to the clinic yesterday, her fever is still turning on and off. to make matters worst, my Lao Er and mum were not feeling too well either. Could it be me who brought this rapid effect of illness among them?   Mum is at the clinic with my Lao Da this very instance. *sneeze* oh god? Could this be a relapse? Bless you (me)! Ok, its about time i prepare to go out to watch "The Day After Tomorrow" again, but this time round with a bunch of guys. See ya later '~'*sneeze*sneeZe*(who in this world is missing me?)
