I also would like to code a "Current Mood" script with smiley faces and such. Heres the two ways I could do it: 1. With evrey post add ? $currently_playing = "Crash Test Dummies - Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm"; $current_mood = "extreamly_tired";  and have the script print it out (including a simley face that goes with the mood) at the bottom. 2. Finaly move my blog to jeffsworld.biz (or .net) COMPLETELY! Note: At the moment it is just hosted at jeffsworld.net and I am using blogger.com for posting/editing the template. When I make a post it uploads all of the files via ftp.  TODAYS PROJECTS: 1. Install FreeBSD 4.9 on a Intel D865PERL motherboard with hyper-threading (SMT) AND an ATI Radeon 9600XT (I need to have 3d exeleration/hyper-threading suport)* 2. Write the smiley script/Mood script  OR  write my own blog  OR  mod the script im using for the network blog. 3. Get something to eat! (Im hungry)  Latter lamers, Jeff  * I know.. i know.. the OS dosen't need SMT support only SMP support. Auctly I don't think there is SMT support in any OS. UH OH! That gives me an idea.. hyper-threading (SMT) GFX cards.. for like multi-monitor's. Or SMT chipsets and stuff! What a good idea! Now intel's gona steal it.. waahhhhh
