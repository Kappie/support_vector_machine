Obviously two human beings were incapable of spawning a cat, and I immediately awarded myself a slap on the wrist for thinking something so impractical. I had rested my head onto his little cat stomach that afternoon, and before I knew it he had begun licking my face, or “bathing” me. The texture of his tongue was a bit awkward, but this mild discomfort was not enough for me to pull away—he had graciously accepted me into his own feline culture, and I was not about to decline solely because his tongue felt somewhat like wet sandpaper being chafed against my forehead. That would be highly discourteous of me. So I allowed him to continue and began thinking about how simple life would be had I somehow been born a cat. Mainly I imagined a life fulfilled with numerous feline-escapades and countless hours spent sleeping. Those two features alone were enough for me to desire the feline high-life. It sounded beautiful—almost too good to be true. The only real drawback that I could think of in living the life of a cat would be the cuisine. To my deepest despair, kibbles and water would undeniably fail to tickle my fancy. For me, happiness would be difficult to find in a life without sandwiches and coca-cola. I would be this adventurous animal with the perfect life outlined for me except for one awful detail—inside of me would exist this yearning for something more. I would be whole and incomplete in the same dreadful instant. I would have dreams of these meaty-breaded visions topped with the works, and all at once I would know that I was being cheated out of something magnificent. And even if some day, some how, I were able to stumble upon an exquisite sandwich for my taking, my little cat mouth would have much difficulty engulfing the whole essence of the sandwich. Not only that, but acquiring any sort of pop to wash it down with would be next to impossible. And let us imagine that some how I was able to come across and eat a flavorsome sandwich, wash it down with a pop, and become momentarily satisfied—this could not possibly be a healthy scenario for a feline. And as an unhealthy feline, I would surely be an unhappy feline. After my bath last Sunday, I held my cat in my arms and thought to myself, “You poor, poor animal.” Then I made myself a sandwich.  30 things about me - cuz hey I am way cool too.
