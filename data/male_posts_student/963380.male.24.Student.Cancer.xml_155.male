The cast of characters seemed interested - I'm not sure if they are telling in anyway. A rather overweight person who seemed to be a native Canadian was trying to intimidate me and break into my home. I managed to subdue him and got him out of the house. His friends showed up in a beat up old Taurus (none of them were native Canadian) and one of them pulled a gun. I quickly pulled the chap who was trying to break in back into the house and managed to get to the kitchen where we struggled over a knife; I eventually won the upperhand. Back outside the others turned over the gun and then sat there as I beat the crap out of the person who was trying to break into my house with a variety of implements. (At some point he got free and started spray painting the two sports utes in the double car sized garage - this becomes an important incongruity later) For some reason even in my dream I stopped myself before delivering a fatal blow. The police came and towed away the car with the three other boys in it and then dragged the other boy away. The dream ended with us reversing a rather large red pickup into the single car sized garage (the truck folded up to accomdate the size).  Then I went outside to interview a young asian girl about a new mosque (say what?) that was being built and how nice it would be.  I'm gonna blame this one on the eye drops.
