You gotta love "The Colour and the Shape" through "One by One."  Nirvana - For the 5 years they were around, kick-ass! Even 8 years after the end of Nirvana, they continued kicking ass with the release of "You Know You're Right."   R.E.M. - Never lost the touch. Even their new stuff is good. "Orange Crush" and "Imitation of Life" are good songs. You gotta like their old and new stuff.  U2 - Alright, Bono, the Edge, the are so cool; cool as in Pacino in Scarface, Uma in Kill Bill. All their stuff rocks! Even their tours have gotten BETTER! I like to compare U2 to a bottle of wine; the get better as they age.  The White Stripes - Okay, only 4 albums, but, 4 albums that kicked ass!!! Okay, their one of few bands I see a good future to. We'll just have to wait and see.   If you have any bands that haven't lost their touch, feel free to e-mail me. Don't gimme some shitty band though, hehe. Alright, I'll keep you posted.   Dedicated to Kelby.
