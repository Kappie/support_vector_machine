We got there and were ready to play and the game before us hadn't even ended with the 3rd quarter.  I started at quick tackle (left side...two away from the center). I played the whole game there except about 4 minutes of the 4th quarter. I also started at right defensive tackle. I was also relieved of my duties there with about 4 minutes to go. By that time we had scored 4 touchdowns and 3 extra points. Combine that with our solid defense and we were ahead 27-0 late in the game. We held onto our lead and won the game by that same score.  The game ended at about 9:00 so our whole team went to  urlLink Mc Donalds  and ate like pigs to celebrate. I had two chicken sandwiches (which I forgot to order plain so I had to clean them off with a french fry) a large drink and a large fry. It was pretty good. I ate until I just about exploded. Travis made a little mess on the floor of the  urlLink Mc Donalds  by spilling a little pop. And "Elmer" tried to get into the playplace with no luck either.  The ride back was interesting with Travis and me talking about everything from cars to other ppl's sex stories (since our sex lives dont really exist quite yet) and multiple other things. Preston (our kicker/substitute D-end) slept on the floor underneath me. We got back at about 11:15 and all headed home. I was so tired. I just crashed at home.  It was not until I woke up that I realized that I had a few minor bumps and bruises. Nothing too big but it was fun to show them off to Jadie and watch her ooh and ahh at them :D
