We went to an art gallery... was pretty interesting. Then we had to meet one of her friends to go to the cinema and I went into a silly, paranoid, possessive mood (that's me...). I realise now it was overly pathetic. But today was the nicest day ever! Mandy's family and myself all went for an all-you-can-eat Chinese meal and I am still really stuffed! The food was so gorgeous and Mandy looked beautiful as always. She's staying at her dads (he's mega strict) for a whole week now. I'll be seeing her on Tuesday though because I'm taking her out for a meal for her 18th! That will be nice. xx
