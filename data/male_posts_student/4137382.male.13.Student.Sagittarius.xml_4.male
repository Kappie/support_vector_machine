(I like Snes9x)  The only problem is that playing with the keyboard sucks.   So I got a soldering gun and a old USB cord.  I took the crappy xBox controller that I got with a Halo 2 video disc.  I used the little extenstion peice at the end and cut 'er open.  After a little while peeling I was able to expose the little wires and match them up to the same color in the USB cord.  (Any that wants to try this, yellow is extra in the xBox cord...)  So, short story long, I now can use my xBox controllers in my computer.  And let me tell you that it is awesome.  Nothing beats sitting a foot from the screen playing the old classics.  Unless you are playing Halo.  Man that game is kickin'
