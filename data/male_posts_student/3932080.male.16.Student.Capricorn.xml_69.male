Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Outrageous -Britney Spears feat. R. Kelly  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #85  She’s had sex on the beach (“Don’t Let Me Be The Last to Know”), on the dance floor (“I’m a Slave 4 U”), and in an airplane (“Toxic”); where else is there for America’s engaged heiress to lose her inhibitions and try to apologize for it later? At some point  R. Kelly  must have mentioned  the Amazon  (I was thinking more the internet), not a surprising suggestion seeing that he recently turned his recording studio into a jungle. That seems the scene for “Outrageous,” a 3½ minute single that advances  Disney’s   Simba  and  Nala  from their  General Audiences  seal into a dirty African orgy (a graduation once staged by  Brit  herself). Seriously, though, the song’s lone highlight is its midsection bridge, when  Britney  croons over an animal kingdom choir that sounds cut from  Elton’s  own “Circle of Life.” What some might call a  Spears / Kelly  “duet” (but is more  Britney  singing while  R.  masturbates), the track rides the limper cousin to “Get Ur Freak On”s bhangra rhythm paired with  Kelly’s  “Thoia Thoing” clichéd instrumentation, fielding flutes, bongos, Eastern strings, and a koto line. As  Brit  asks climactically to be taken to a place where “love is free” to be as “sexy as [she] wants to be,” it becomes clear that  Kevin Federline  will not be able to get her there (much less spell the song’s title).   The Verdict:  5.9/10 - Brouhaha   (2.95/5)
