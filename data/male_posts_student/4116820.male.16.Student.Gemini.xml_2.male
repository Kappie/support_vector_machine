Maggots all over tghe trash ("it stunk so it couldn't stay in the garage")after taking it out I cleaned the cans and took a long shower. What relevence this has to anything else I know not but I thought I'd write it anyways. My computers on the frizt right now so I'm stuck on this one, my dads. Right about now I'm watching "Skillet - Savior" on SteelRoots which is this sweet christian music show. I'm not usually all about that kind of thing but I do like SteelRoots. Humm what to ridicule oh yes, I remember from last night. I was watching TV (bad choice) and what was on, reruns of  FULL HOUSE  I think that says just about everything. Wow, I'm so nice I cleaned my whole house today.
