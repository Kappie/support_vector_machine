Weep not for the memories. -Sarah McLachlan, "I Will Remember"   the rest of June went by pretty fast. my time was mostly devoted to making collages of pictures from the DC trip and watching seasons 1-4 of buffy. as time went on more and more people knew about my sexual orientation. oo i redecorated my room too. anyway, the day.. well more like night was June 20th. Nathalie and I went to Capitola Book Cafe and waited for the release of Harry Potter 5. it was a lotta fun, and the Shoreline band played for a little bit. there were nasty milk and cookies but it was a really fun night. nathalie and i talked and talked about buffy and jamie added some stuff in.  jamie was really cool.. she went to shoreline last year but now shes gone.. well thats another story that ill save for august.  kristen was there too.. she was a grade lower than us, just like jamie. kristen is short, but shes cool.. and her hair is REALLY fluffy.  anyway, nathalie and i bought our books and then i waited around with kalie and naomi until it was time to go.  kalie's my cousin and naomi is one of her best friends... no explanation needed there.  anyway, staying up 'til midnight was a whole lotta fun and i wouldn't have as much fun doing it until kassie's party in november.  the weeks of June lingered on. two days after i got my book we took a trip down south to LA/Oxnard. i met a really nice guy at the hotel we stayed at. his name was Ben. anyway, i spent most of the trip reading and i finished the twice in eight days.  after we got back, my mom and i talked about my birthday which was less than a month away! i wanted a cell phone and she agreed that i should have one.  the phone rang and i picked it up. Ili. she's pretty cool and i've known her for a really long time. her and bonnie were the first people i told about me being gay. anyway, she told me to come see the play bonnie was in cause there was a gay guy there named Dominic.  "Dominic..." the name rolled over my tounge. "Hot name.."  anyway, i declined her offer to go to the play, but she left me one good thing to think about..  "dominic..."  hehe.. ptfo! -Brandon
