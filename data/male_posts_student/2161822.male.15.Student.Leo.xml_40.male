It got a little pathetic when I had to shoot the ball a foot away from the basket to have it go in. Now when I run cold water over my hands it feels like its scalding hot. Plus it's hard to type right now since my fingers are all numb and swolen. I guess I'm just plain stupid since I do this everyday. Well, goodbye Thanksgiving vacation. It was nice while it lasted. But now only a few weeks until (dun dun dun) Christmas vacation. I might be one of the few kids that doesn't like snow. Maybe if I could snowboard well or ski or play hockey. But noo. I can't do crap in the winter. It's basically me shoveling snow and proceeding to jump in the huge piles of snow only to have me shovel it again. 70° and sunny is fine for me. Oh yeah. Just like to let everyone know (though you probably know already) that the great band Neötærik will be performing at Funny Bones sometime before Christmas. It is planned that they will open for the band Astatic. Please everyone come support them. You WILL be impressed.  Listen to H.I.M.
