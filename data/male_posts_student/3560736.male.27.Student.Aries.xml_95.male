Michele has some excellent thoughts on a subject that I've been thinking alot about recently:  urlLink SBHFS: Sudden Bush Hatred Fatigue Syndrome .  Her basic thesis is that in all the years she's been following politics she cannot remember a time when so much hatred was being pushed around. She does have a point that there are far more outlets for that kind of sentiment than there ever have been, but in essence I think that isn't really a factor. There just simply is more visceral reaction and people are more willing to trip the switch toward an emotional reaction than ever before. It's easier, it takes far less thought and effort and it isn't looked on as disapprovingly as in times past.  There is just more room for hate.  It's a development that I'm not pleased with. What happened to responsibility and civility? I don't care if you disagree with my viewpoints, but if you do could you possibly tell me why in reasoned terms and then propose a different solution?  That's what's missing most of the time. Complain and rail, but don't offer counter solutions. Just point out what's wrong with the current situation.  I'm fatigued as well. It's exhausting - and I'm utterly certain that the "other side" feels the same way. There can even be credible arguments made that the current environment of hate began with Clinton and the position taken by the right during his administration. But I don't think either "side" is to blame exclusively or even more than the other. We just arrived at this point together.  What a way to live a life. I used to be interested in politics, but now I'm not sure that I have the stones to deal with the current climate. What kind of pressure would that put on my family? I'm not sure I would be willing to put them through that kind of experience.   UPDATE:  Jeff Jarvis has  urlLink truly excellent and must-read  thoughts on the matter.
