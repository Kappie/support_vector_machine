Scary music, anime and all. I'm getting confused with all the links pero it's good. I'm in deep envy pero I'm sunk so deep in school and laziness kaya I'll just stay the same old me and same old pages. Cute rin naman. Bahala na!   Oo nga pala, na-try mo na ba ang  urlLink Dairyland ? Well, I know. It's kinda cutesy pero I think I'll try it. Not for my site. I'll go cheap and make websites and give them to my friends. Personal and yet, not at all useless, right?   Ano nga ba talaga ang kalokohan sa friendster?
