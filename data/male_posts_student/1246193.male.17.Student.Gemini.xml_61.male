Somehow it is different this year, I don't know why but it just is.  I was tired last night at nine-thirty; I went to bed and fell asleep.  There was none of the Christmas Eve jitters.  I was happy, just not that jumping up and down, can't sleep kind of happy.  There is no snow.  I am glad that it is Christmas, it just seems to be missing something.  I got everything that I wanted.  My mom and sister decided not to go to mass this morning.  It was just me and my dad, it was nice but I wanted my whole family to be there.  The choir sucked as is typical at the morning masses.  I want to go back to the days when Santa Clause was real and I didn't buy my own presents.  The days when my sister and I woke my parents up at five-thirty in the morning to see what we had gotten.  The days when the whole house smelled like Christmas food and there were pounds of my Grandma's candy on every surface in sight.  Those days are gone, Santa Clause turned out to be my parents, I slept in today, and Grandma died six years ago.
