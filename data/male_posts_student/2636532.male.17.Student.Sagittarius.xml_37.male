The only reason I say Matt has no life is because he somehow finds time to blog pretty frequently which for me would be impossible since I am just too lazy to even try. I have so much work to do since my spring break just finished. I have to suffer once again from that horrible thing called school. I think though that this is a better waste of my time then homework. Although I might have physics and chem homework and probably a socials project that is due most likely tomorrow... I am sticking by this quote so I don't have to do it: "Work pays off in the future, but laziness pays off now." So I figure that if I am always lazy, it will always pay off and I will never have to work. Yes flawed logic that is laced with denial and total ignorance is always fun. I just lost my total point to whatever I was writing because I was distracted by the flashy 40% off sign on amazon.ca.... It was for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. So I ordered it, but not from that site. I got it from chapters.ca because then I don't have to pay the stupid PST that comes with living in BC. Evil evil place. Oh well at least now I get free shipping and not have to pay the evil tax and I get a good book when it come out! Hmm... that would make a good commercial for chapters. "Pre-order the new Harry Potter books and get FREE shipping and 40% off! That's not all... you also don't have to pay those shitty scams they call provincial taxes!" Couldn't you just picture a used car sales man type of guy with a flashy smile telling you all this? And yes I am aware that Alberta is lucky and doesn't have to pay the 7.5% tax we have to pay on top of GST. That's why I love to shop there when I buy expensive things. Either that or I just say I'm 13 when I buy clothes and I get exempt from it anyway. The only thing the PST really bugs me on is when I buy my DVDs because if I buy box sets and I can't find them on chapters.ca then I usually have to pay an extra $50 just for that one dumb tax. Yes life is unfair because I am now in debt and don't have a job since nobody seems to want to employ me because I have no experience. Although the being in debt part is my fault because I just developed a nasty habit of buying DVDs and books. I think that in the last 3 months alone I spent $300 on both.... heehee... oospy... that was basically all the money I will see for the rest of the year. But on the plus side my collections are both growing steadily! I now have 49 DVDs to my name that I absolutely adore and would not be able to live without. Stupid amazon has a wish list page that makes it so I can put any more movies that I want but can't buy yet there... so I have 22 of them just sitting and waiting.... all calling my name. To any of those actually reading this... yes I have a problem...  - Dark Lily  0>--}----
