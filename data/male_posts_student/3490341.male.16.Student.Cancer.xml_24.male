Who is that, prowling amidst the steppes! It is ***Real Name***, hands clutching a meaty axe! He howls mightily: "As sure as predators devour prey, I hereby snap and go berzerk!!!"  Prowling across the hotel lobby, attacking with a sharpened screwdriver, cometh Big Chief Little Nick! And he gives a spectacular cry: "I'm going to beat the flaming shit out of you!!"  Rampaging over the icy wasteland, swinging a jeweled meat hammer, cometh Adwarfnamed007! And he gives an ominous howl: "I'm seriously going to bruise you like a first grade teacher!"  Prowling over the mini-mall parking lot, swinging a thorned whip, cometh Weespecybloke! And he gives a booming roar: "In the name of Thor the Mighty, I sow darkness and discord with reckless abandon!"
