You can re-enforce your point of view to other people just in case they missed your point on the first post....they have the second and the third post to remind themselves of your arguments. :) Oh yeah and about the assembly, I'm so sad that I can't be there tomorrow, because of the NorthWest Science Expo, I'm sure it will be awesome.
