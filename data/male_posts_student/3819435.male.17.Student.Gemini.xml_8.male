(If you don't, leave a comment and I shall answer questions.) Anyway, this friend of mine seems to be mad at me for something I did last month (July). This action of mine was not my choice, I was scheduled to work even though I requested it off. Where I work, you don't always get what you want. That's one of the joys of working for a corporate business. So, my friend, don't be mad at me. If you need to blame someone, blame Sears Roebuck  Co., okay? Can't we just be friends again? Please? There, I've apologized and made a full reckoning of my sins, so don't hate me anymore. Nighty night!
