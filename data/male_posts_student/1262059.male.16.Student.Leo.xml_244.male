NEWFLASH PPL, im turning 18 next yr! "no ur not!" YES I AM...."well...*mumbles*...*counts*...*changes subject"  wat i thought even FUNNIER was when my mom had issues leaving me alone @ home, even tho i had done it MANY times b4...  "mom..i can stay home alone *lifts a brow at her*"  "ur only 15!" she cries...-_______- me> O_O IM 16 MOM--TURNING 17 FYI  dad > *laughs* ahhh, yeah, look at u, wanting to be older, just wait, when u DO get older, ull want to be younger  *me cannot believe wat i am hearing, my own PARENTS dont believe im 16*  "I AM 16! WHY WOULD I LIE ABOUT THAT?" "Nooooo" they both say, and then freeze. "OHHHH...YOU ARE!"  *falls to floor and twitches*   here's another scene:   (this is her trying to consol my disapointment at their refusal to lemme go to europe)mom>>you know, most ppl who go to europe usually do it after they graduate...  me>> O_O............*says slowly* mooom...i hope you realize im graduating next yr.......... mom>> you are??? NO! ur not! me>>*says slowly* yes mom..ill b in GR 12!! i mit go back for a semester..but technically...im in my last yr.... mom >> noooo...and ur taking a yr off? *she's like this> o_o* me> yes...getting a job and saving up for uni mom>> oh..........which uni r u going to? me>> dunno. mom> O_O  so yeah, this has kinda got me like...thinking im in the twilight zone. man....at one point i was thinking...AM i 15...?? no NO IM NOT!   weeiiiirrrdd....  AND if ne of u wanna join in a petition to EUROPE, come get a job wid me and we'll save up 2,500 $ FOR IT! YEAAHHHH
