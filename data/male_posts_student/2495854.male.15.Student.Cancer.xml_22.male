GreEenjeLLybeAn1: it was like a cross-over   anyway, after lots of hugs and catching up, we walked down to jade street. haha chase was like "you're gay? that's so cool that you're open like that. if i was gay i wouldn't tell anyone." haha. they left and lily got her yearbook and amy and tina made me run through the swings!! it was so scary. and then we looked at lily's yearbook.  i saw someone who's HOTiZZle. and then my dad came and amy chased after my car. haha.  i just hung at home that night and talked to kyle on the phone for two hours or so. he's super cool (my vans are still better than his steve maddens). sunday was fun too. i went downtown with mischa, steve and anna. anna = caroline's sister. she was home from santa barbra. most of the people i hang out with that dont go to my school are really good friends of the family. we've known each other sicne we were two, partied together since we knew how to party, exchanged christmas gifts, shopped, travelled and.. basically.. had a good time. most of us even go to the same church.  the cool people are: Brandon Aiono (me) Caroline Simmons and Anna Simmons Lilly Thomas and Josie Thomas Steve Hinkel and Mischa Hinkel Kelly Tanner and Becky Tanner Sarah Shane Ben Elmore and Aurora Elmore Dylan Los Huertos and Kia Los Huertos Nora Stewart and Eva Stewart Lindsay Taylor Nate Kaufman and Brian Kaufman Greg Safranek, Nicole Safranek, and Colin Safranek  we may not all be rich but we come from families that have been friends forever. we all have elite qualities, star soccer players, brillant school kids, hilarious comedians, extreme bikers and horse-back riders, musically gifted, and athletically talented.  well i had to go home early but misch is the best. HAPPY BIRTHDAY BOY! downtown we just shopped around and mischa fell in love with these lucky brand jeans. steve was actually being cool and anna and i had a reunion. it was fun. hanging out with them made waking up after 5 hours of sleep worht it.  back at home i did homework and slept. i went to bed early and soon it was another week of chem+bio.  MONDAY (7/12): chem- hung out with nathalie and checked out the macy's preseason catalog. ooo purrrple. natania and amanda and i had fun too. it was a good day. nate was lookin cute in his plaid polo tee and monte was hot as always. IT'S SPELLED MONTE!! woo! i learned that today. anyway, the lecture was just gas laws and the lab was finding out the Molecular Weight of a certain gas. so we had to like fill a flask with water and seal it and then put it upside down in water so the water doesnt rush out. and we had to measure the temperature, volume, emperical mass and pressure.  mr. oka told us to SEAL THE FLASK REALLY REALLY WELL. so i pushed down on the stopper really really really hard and the flask BURST senting shards of glass everywhere; knicking three of my fingers and the palm of my right hand. it all happened so fast it didn't really hurt.. lucielle, the AWESOME lab technician took me in the back and cleaned the blood of my hands. while she went to go get bandaids, josh (the teacher from next door who was int eh lab room) started rubbing antiseptic on. this was our convo:  me- ow.. ow.. oww josh- haha, great job. me- *blush* josh- don't worry, i've done that before.. soo many times. me- really? josh- yep. me- great, now i'm gonna have cuts all over. josh- don't worry, the other gay guys'll think you're tough and cute. me- :-)  AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK HIM IF HE WAS GAY BUT THERE WAS THIS LOUD CRASH! and amanda's like "shit!" and him and i run out and see another flask on the ground and natania with a dust pan. haha. amanada dropped our SECOND flask. (our group=amanda, natania, nathalie, me and MONTE! yeah, i got him to work with us. that hot hunk.) anyway, mr. oka was trying to get the stopper out of the flask and he was like "i can't even get this out, it's soo far wedged in" and josh laughed and patted me on the back. anyway, once we recovered a flask we were putting the gas into the water and monte broke the nozzle off and the butan gas started LEAKING EVERYWHERE!! ahh!! it was soooo crazy. we all like.. evacuted from our table because it smelle dlike shit and lucielle came out with a gas mask laughing and shes like "you guys are cursed!" it was hilarious. nathalie broke the mecury thermometer after that. and then we did the lab and monte was like.. touching me.. ahh.. i almost orgasmed. he's so skater/surfer boy HOT HOT HOT. i died.  not really though. after the lab natania and i were outside and she's like "IM THE ONLY ONE WHO WASN'T CURSED!" and then a tennis ball hit her in the back of the head. ouch. haha. she shook her head and left.  home inbetween= talking to the fam about the injury and talking to other people about hot josh.  bio was regular. we had a lab quiz and andonis and i were making fun of chickens. then we sat through a BORING lecture on tCELLS. ahh. ben was looking hot though. so it was all good. i went home and did the homework and then i just relaxed on my bed and drifted off to sleep sleep sleep.  TUESDAY (7/13):  is it just me or is 13 my lucky number?? nathalie's lucky 2.  okay so in class we just lectured and stuff and monte waved to me. and yeah. natania and amanda and i were laughing and having fun like always. and then when we did LAB we had to find the properties of unknwon solutions and stuff.. and nathalie and i got 13. it's weird becase the order in which the chemicals were listed was the order in which our chemicals were..  A= the first one on the list B= the second one on the list C= the third D= can you guess?? NO!! IT WAS THE FOURTH!  blah blah. so it was really easy.. and cool. and it was group number 13 because all the things are different. after we finished that lab we were walking out to the parking lot because nathalie's aunt was gonna pick us up and we were gonna go see a movie- anchorman. it was weird because this wouldn't have happened if nathalie wasn't there. anyway, we were standing where i usually wait for my dad after biology, and guess who was walking out.  no. you won't fuckign believe this.  GUESS FUCKING WHO.  that's right bitches. it was joe viglienzoni.  i was so excited.. i thought it was like a fucking dream. anyway he walked out of the math building where THE NIGHT BEFORE IN BIO i was WITH ASHTON AND ERICA AND CIARA AND NAOMI BUYING CHIPS AFTER THE QUIZ!! it was so crazy. i have already filled cabrillo with memories. and i love it.  anyway this was our conversation:  brandon- "is that JOE VIGLIENZONI?" joe- *looks up* "it's brandon! :-)" brandon- "what are you doin' here, boy?" joe- "i'm taking english, you?" brandon- "bio and chem." joe- "=-o both! you overachiever, you!" brandon- *shrugs* "you know me.." joe- :-) brandon- "so how's your summer going?" joe- "good, *looks back and at his dad who's walking out with a student and then turns back around. his dad is a math teach at cabrillo* yours?" brandon- "it's been good. i've been thinkin' a lot about you." joe- :-) "cool" -i was blushing by this time so i kinda walked towards nathalie's aunt's car cause she drove up- brandon- "well.. it was good seeing you.." joe- "you have no idea."  OMG I LIKE MELTED WHEN I WALKED INTO NATHALIE'S AUNTS CAR. nathalie was like smiling at me and stuff. and then nathalie's aunt is like the most awesomest fucking person on this planet. you have know idea. she has the FUNNIEST stories and she listens to the shizzlest music. i wish she was my aunt. she told us a story about how like they amde the kids at the day care where she works.. they made them stand in line and push soap on their hands and then dip their hands in water and then towel off with a soap-ie towel and then more water and then another dry towel. and then the lady like cut little slices of food in front of each other them and like gave them each a little peice and the kid she was sitting by was like "I WANT MORE FOOD. MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE." (when she said that nathalie and i were already TOTALLY cracking up) and then she said she talked to gabi who went to that day care thing and she's like "did they make you wash your hands?" and gabi said "yeah" and shes like "what'd you do?" and gabiu's like " there was a sink..." it was soooo funny.  we got to nathalie grandma's and unloaded our things and gabi told nathalie about how jose.. lied to her. (AND NATHALIE DIDNT BELIEVE ME.) so instead of seeing the movie nathalie and i walked to crystals and chilled with her and then we walked to the mall. i love crystal's house, it's so cute. haha crystal's sister lost the phone under the bed and we were like searching for it. it was GReAT. and then we walked to the mall (we all looked super hot) and when we got there we found out jose wasn't working. so we just chilled at different stores. we went to express because i wanted to show nathalie the pearls and i noticed there was a cute guy working who i had only seen once before- at structure. jaye intro'd be to him. brandon tracy. he has my NAME. >:-O. oh well, i'll let it slide. anyway, i thought he was actually pretty cute and i wanted to talk to him.. but i was nervous. i eventually did... haha "i'm looking for something for back to school, any suggestions?" and then he was showing me stuff.. and we talked and laughed and stuff.. too bad he's not younger, he'd be fun.  anyway, after that we went to walden's because crystal had this freaky prophetic-ish dream and she told us about it on the walk over to the mall and in express so we were going to consult some horoscopes and dream dictionaires. (my idea.. yeah. someone stole it from me the next day though. tina knows who i'm talkin about cause i told her lol.) anyway, we read some interesting books and shit and then we walked to longs and bought a ouija board (my idea.. AGAIN..) and i ended up paying the most out of all of us, which is important (i'll tell you why later). anyway, crystal's little sisters are way cool. haha nathalie made fun of a hippie.. and there was one sitting RIGHT THERE. it was funny.  we asked the ouija board some questions and i was like "will i see joe again this summer?" and it said "YES!" which is cool because.. the next day.. well,.. you'll see. and then i asked what would happen between be and jack when he came back and it said "fun stuff." wooooo.  nathalie walked me home and i talked to tina for a little. oh yeah i talked to people online at crystal's house about JOE!! woo. he's SO hot.  all this time you were pretending, so much for my happy ending.  bio was basically me telling the stories to EVERYONE and uhh we watched a movie on mad cow disease and it was really sad. i feel bad for people who have to suffer through that. it's crazy. i blame the people who fed sheep parts to cows. oprah was cool to stand up for people and stuff.  anyway, after that we got to do another mating thing haha only it was more controlled. we got gloves with liquid on it and we had to mix liquid with other people and at the end we would find out whether or not we were infected with a disease. so i did: naomi, megan and calandra.  and i got the disease. i fucking got the disease!! haha the infected people were:  brandon, naomi, bach, calandra, megan, travis, jason biencarti, and kassondra.  it turned out naomi was the initial spreader of the disease. haha.  here's the path:  R1 naomi- - - - - brandon  R2 kassondra megan  R3 bach travis jason calandra   haha it was CRAZY. but fun.

HER CAR ALMOST FLIPPED ON THE WAY BACK TO THE SCHOOL!! HAHA!!  when we got out bach left and erika left. while naomi and ciarra were checking out the dust damage to fiona (ciarra's green honda), ashton and i went to wash her shoes and she changed into her dress and ciarra changed into a new shirt. we DECIDED that all of us were gonna hang out.  so we drove to the "do it yourself" car wash and we got to was fiona!! it was sooo cool! i soaped her and foamed her and then ciarra rinsed and then we thoguht we were done but this like.. yellow liquid spit out.. and it was like.. wax.. lol. so we had to totally redo the car wash. and i got to be on the inside when they washed it. she sprayed off all the wax and then she tried to turn it off but she accidently sprayed MORE WAX ON. it was the funniest thing in the world. i couldn't stop laughing. then when we were done we all drove back to cabrillo and ashton met her blind date, BOB. he was actually pretty cute but kinda gay.. anyway, they left and we were gonna meet them downtown so naomi, ciarra and i took off and we decided to go to my house. and we were pulling off the kmart exit of the freeway and there was this rosemary bush outside and ciarra wanted a pinch so i jumped out of the car and grabbed it but i acctually like.. pulled off a whole branch. haha. it was hilarious. then naomi and her had some and it made them all itchy and they were like hallucinating haha. i was just sitting there.  we stopped at my hosue and i got money, changed and told my mom where i was going. she said it was cool and then we were off to downtown. we met up with ash and bob and then the five of us walked to taqueria valliarta whatever. and we got food and ate and it was yummy and BIG. bob and we were all just.. hanging out.. having a good time. anyway, we let bob and ashton go do "there thing" and ciarra, naomi and i drove home. it was a great night! i was out until 10! woo!! that's gotta be a record.. i dont think i've stayed outside later than that unless i was at someone's house.. cool.  OH GOD, on the way BACK from downtown we were driving past the little hospital (THAT ISN'T DOMINICAN) and like we saw these people on the side of the road and i was kinda making fun of them cause it was this chick in REALLY SHORT SHORTS. and like, this guy in a cut sleeve shirt.. so weird.. and then the girl like ran up to ciarra's car and was asking where a gas station was and so ciarra and naomi and i were trying to tell them and then CIARRA, being the goody-two-shoes that she is (BUT I CAN'T BLAME HER FOR IT, CAUSE WE ALL LOVE HER!), invites them TO TAKE A RIDE WITH US TO THE NEAREST GAS STATION. UHHH.  so THESE TWO HICKS PILE INTO THE BACK WITH ME!! ME!!

WHAT??? YEAH!! so ciarra dropped them on the corner of 7th and capitola by that one (i wanna say shell...) gas station and they thanked us kindly and left.  ciarra's like "i bet brandon hates me now."  and i was like "just.. keep.. driving. before they ask for a ride back home."  ciarra dropped naomi off and we were gonna drive down the road screaming "BRANDON TRACY!" since he lives by naomi and her sister and brandon were best friends and.. i dunno.. i kinda had a CRUSH on him. SHHH. eww!! i never said that. SHUT UP.  anyway, ciarra drove me home and we almost got attacked my a psycho dog that ran into the crosswalk near burger king (we took the REALLY REALLY long route.) but i got home safely.

WE'RE SUCH DORKS!! alex and i were like, trying to figure out all the words that don't have vowels (a,e,i,o,u) it was soo great! and we had an enlightening conversation with amy about the pressures of being gay. it was a real HEART to HEART!  oh! i also got an oppurtunity to chat online with andrew violante! that kid is awesome, and if you think otherwise, you better watch your mouth.  hmm nothing else really happened~!! amy is the BEST though.  i woke up at like 2, wishing i was still asleep. i took a shower, and then did what i promised myself i would do that day.  something so important, i can't even begin to explain..  I READ GOSSIP GIRL FIVE!! it was awesome! two hours to read it from cover to cover, mostly because i forgot a lot of the stuff and i never really finished.. it was sooo good though!! i like it like that ;-) the end was so beautiful! everyone together in the park, everyone happy again.  but there are some questions i wanna ask.. what happened with aaron and the veggie chick from hawaii? are nate and blair gonna hook up again? is she gonna LOSE it to him? why did erik have to leave! is chuck gay or just PRETENDING? is this the last we'll see of G? who is the gossip girl? why was everyone sitting on red blankets, they are so passe.  oh well! there are still three books let~ and i know I can't wait to get my hands on them!  after reading that EXCELLENT book (you all need to go out and read them) i watched the butterfly effect on my computer and talked to people online.  daniel viviani isn't that bad! still, soquel should be MY school. i need a place to escape all that gay drama.  okay, so then it was around 9 and i was writing in my blog, putting the final touches on. there was thsi FUCKING LOUD BAND play WEIRD MUSIC and pretending they could FUCKING SING~?? i told my mom to call the police and say it sounded like someone was getting murdered by bikes with electric guitars. but she rolled her eyes and went to feed the baby.  my dad came home (i didn't know he was gone..) with a stanford sweatshirt, just for me! my mom said he drove all the way up there 'cause he felt bad about yelling at me and telling me to take the boys of my binder. haha, anyway, i liked that gift. although it wasn't the BRAND NEW CAR that KATY just got.  oh well. the butterfly effect was such a good movie! i ended up watching the wrong version, the director's cut! it was sooo sad!! it would make people want to commit suicide! ahh!! no wonder they didn't play it in theaters. the end made me cry~ ashton kutcher = sooo cute!  my grandparents came over, they noticed the insane music (who didn't). my grandma then bursted out into this hilarious story of how she sped down HW1 at 73 miles an hour ! she is extreme g-ma! it's crazy, but cool~ as she told the story, she'd occasionally take pauses to say "AND DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT!" to me. haha. when the cop pulled her over she was just like "oh? i was speeding? i didn't knowi could do that.." and the cop was like "you were going 73." and she was like "oh! 73! i thought it said 13!" so he let her off with just a warning (my grandma is sooo good at lying!!) and yeah! haha. she's so great. she taught me what a whore was when i was 9. she was drunk and talking about this lady and she's like "THEY CALL HER MADAME! YOU KNOW WHAT A MADAME IS? IT'S SOMEONE WHO HOUSES THE WHORES!" and i was just like "uh.." and she was like "YOU KNOW WHAT A WHORE IS? IT'S SOMEONE WHO SELLS HER BODY FOR MONEY!!
