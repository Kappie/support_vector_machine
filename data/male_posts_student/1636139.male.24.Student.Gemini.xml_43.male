It seems everybody is jumping on the wireless LAN bandwagon these days. Curious, I tried each one  found 2 that had been left wide open. Consequently, I am now able to connect to the Net 
by piggybacking on either of these 2. No more being tethered to a 7 foot ethernet cable :-)
  
I also qualified to be one of the 10 Sun Microsystems employees attending the Computer History Museum's 
 urlLink 2003 Fellow Awards Celebration  next Tuesday.
