What's the sense of doing all this investigation and court shit if it already happened. Just leave it alone America. Fucking let it be. What is there to do, arrest metal detector people? Exactly, they can't do that. They can't do anything about it. Even if they find someone's mistake for being held responsible for 911, it doesn't matter. It was everyone's mistake, us humans make mistakes. Ours was overestimating our security and letting things slide. I just hate people making all this fuss about it just so America has non-stop bad news going on because that's all everyone wants to fuckin hear these days. It's always bad news. How bout talking about the beauty of flowers and the sun or something or how to lose weight or something that makes people happy. Talk about little Johnny who was saved from a burning down building. Please, I'm fed up with depressing news in this fucked up world. Oh yes, and I new religion is that this whole world is mine. I own it all. My mind runs it all. You're all fake and imaginary and part of my mind. Only I am real existing in an outside world (similiar to the matrix) and all of everything else is fake. The only real thing is my mind. Fuck you all you simulators that don't even know you're simulators! YOU ALL THINK YOU'RE REAL!!! Haha, oh man its fun to piss people off. I bet everyone of you that's reading this is getting pissed off right now. But seriously I'm sick of bad news, not serious about the mind thing but bad news must stop. Everyone just fucking behave. haha...right. ANYWAYS, today I hung out with Paul and Ricky playing Homerun Derby and then went for some ices. Then I went out to dinner for my aunt's birthday to a gay restaurant that was pretty good. Indigo it's called and the 2 guys that own it used to own my aunt's house. I don't hate gay people anymore. In fact, they're very good people. They're very stylish and jesus they make houses so nice. I mean for my ocd, they're perfect people. They're all neat and good and stylish. But the clothes gotta go, but for a house design, I'm getting a gay guy tochoose.The house my aunt lives in is so awesomely designed. And the restaurant too and the food was great. So thumbs up for gay people not being on my hate list anymore. Now I'm home listening to Under Pressure by Queen...love that damn song.
