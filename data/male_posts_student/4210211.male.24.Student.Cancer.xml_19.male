I'm positive that Shankar and Srinivas know more about this than I, so let me know if we'd like to get a different site, change the look, etc.  I imagine we'll delete this first post, but let me know what you guys think.  Also, how do we get rid of the blogspot link at the top? Do you guys get a link button on your page (I think that's a problem with macs)?
