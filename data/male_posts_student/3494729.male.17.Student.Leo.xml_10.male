Why don't more people watch Family Guy?  Is there anything more straining than when someone you like does something you don't like?  How do teenagers not care about voting? What if a candidate proposes college tuition cuts, or planned on cutting jobs in the field in which the teen hopes to work? Would they still not care?  Are people inherently bad at being subtle or is everyone just afflicted with a horrible lack of perception?  If you could you read people's minds, would you really want to? Think about it.  If someone was 100% percent honest and forthcoming, would anyone like them?  What color is glass? (Note: clear/transparent is not a color)  If no one had guns, would anyone need guns?  Hmmm.....  -alex
