In the great tradition of wasps, this one was not particularly helpful and did not buzz its frustration home to me, but let me reach back, run my fingers through my hair in the bored way I do, and meet the tail of the wasp in a rather painful way. I cringed, pulled my hand back, heard a buzzing and swore quietly to myself in real agony before walking fairly quickly to the toilet, where I smeared the affected index finger with hand creme. I didn't care whether it was acid or alkali, I just smeared it on and prayed it would neutralise; here it seemed luck was on my side. Or, so I thought. As I looked at myself in the mirror, regarding my rather pained expression, I heard a buzzing again next to my ear and fell to my knees on the toilet floor - I had not yet been rid of the wasp (this is what proved to me that it was a wasp, not a bee), and now it wanted revenge on my neck. I squatted there for what seemed an age, while the wasp angrily buzzed around, and then I slowly stood up, removing my blazer. Once again my luck sported a brief appearance and the wasp had walked onto my blazer. I picked up the blue cloth and flicked it, sending the insect into the air. It buzzed towards the ceiling and got electricuted by the faulty light. That'll show it. I think the calmness with how I approached first the librarian (I wanted to find out if she knew what to do about wasp stings) and then the receptionist is a credit to how little I panic in general, although the index finger on my left hand is now swollen, the major difference between the affected and unaffected digits being that, unbent, my knuckle skin lies flat against my finger normally; whereas my swollen finger's knuckle juts out around half a centimetre... which is a fair way when you consider it doesn't normally do that. I can also only bend it slightly, as a result of the swelling. Fiddle-dee-dee.  Love, Jon Roskilly
