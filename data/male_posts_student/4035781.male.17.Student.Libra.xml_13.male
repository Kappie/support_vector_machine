Zanshin thus connotes "following through" in a technique, as well as preservation of one's awareness so that one is prepared to respond to additional attacks.  Had an excellent karate class today. Was an excellent class with a focus on goju kata's. I picked up one new kata, no chance on Earth I could spell it correctly though. One of the class members from another dojo called me and Adam "strong" that amuses me... though it was in reference to our current belt standing. Judging from what sensei said I should be up for a grading soon, complimented me on my technique, hinted at it, said pinan shodan was a strong kata for myself - no clue when that came about. Though I did ace it that one time I was living in the dream during class... wish I could do that more often.  As for the title of this blogg, Zanshin (had to look this up btw) follow through and the maintaining of awareness. Awareness is important to be preserved, discrations can make you miss the obvious. Later on, you can look back and think how blind you were. I also should keep aware now that I'm living the single life, I'm not great at reading people I don't know. I am however good at making friends, so I'm gonna have to get on that. So many of my old friends have gone down paths that take them from mine, or drifted away. I can only look forward to when our paths cross again. In the mean time I can only hope I don't spend too much time alone before univeristy... I really have become a lot more social, being alone now depresses me unless I apply myself to something worth while. What is more important in life than friends, love and family eh?
