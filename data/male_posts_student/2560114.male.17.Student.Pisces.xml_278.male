Alfred helped me a bit at practice with passing, but it was pretty stressful cuz i've been use to the form of passing that i was taught and its hard to convert to another form that quickly, so i jus have to try to pass well with my crap form...haha. I really want to play for Hawaii, Alfred said that i can definately make the team if i jus tried out as a walk on next season...but the tape will, hopefully, secure a spot on the team instead of having to try out. Alfred and Dan told me that i really have to work hard, so that i can improve my game once college comes around...Overall, i would love to play with Alfred at hawaii, eventhough i'm only goin to play with him his senior year. Jus playin for a great D-1 college team and living in a paradise that i want to live in, its totally awesome. I don't want to get confident  and say that i've already made it, i haven't yet. But i want to work hard and improve so i could b a top player at the college level...and i believe i can do it. It's gonna b tuff along the way though, so i jus have to keep at it and do the best that i can...i mean so far this summer i played at the beach almost everyday, also playin at oxnard almost everyday...the more i touch the ball, the more i will improve along the way. But thats my main focus for the rest of the year...secure a spot at the vball team at Hawaii U....payce outside.
