Bush should have seen 9/11 coming. Bush should have spent more money on security when he came into office. Bush should have known where Bin Laden was in Afghanistan. Bush should have known that there were no large stocks of WMD, despite what the world intel services were saying. Bush should have known Iraq would take a long time to pacify. It goes on and on, all of it centered on second guessing decisions that were made before the outcome could have been known.   Kedwards talks about what he would have done. How he would have handled it differently, as if that is supposed to be proof of leadership qualities. Maybe Kerry would be a good leader, but this approach isn't sufficient to illustrate that ability. What about those on the Left that predicted ten thousand dead Americans and a one year campaign to take Baghdad? What about the claims from the Left that Saddam would use the WMDs (that they knew all along he didn't have anyway) and take out whole divisions of American soldiers?   Again, I can't imagine being so twisted up that I can't acknowledge that Bush has done a pretty good job given the situation and information he has had to work with. Yes, mistakes have been made, but I don't think any of those mistakes came from malfeasance, a dark desire for power, or the presence of a pentagram beneath the Oval Office carpet. Maybe if Bush was in league with Satan, that psychic ability would be part of the package.   I frequently bash Bush and my own party when they do stupid things. I've praised Clinton on a few occasions. I LIKE Joe Leiberman, despite the 2000 electoral mess and his willingness to sell out his convictions for the #2 spot on the ticket. I'll praise things when I see them, even if it comes from the other side.   All I ask is honesty in our handling of the War on Terror. I ask principled democrats to disavow things like Michael Moore, or comparisons of Bush and Hitler, or Ted Kennedy saying that Abu Ghraib is just like Saddam's practices. We don't need that in a reasoned debate, especially when the stakes are so high.
