This most recent dedication is differentiated from previous declarations by nothing at all so far as I can tell. Upon review, it would seem that I only take the time to blog if I'm really upset about something and this leaves any reasonable reader with the impression that I'm continually pissed off.   Generally speaking, I am an optimistic guy. Now, if only everything didn't suck... ;-)
