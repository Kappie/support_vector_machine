Before getting sober, I was up in school in the northeast.  I took my first drink when I was 16.  I had just gotten my drivers license, and I was with two other guys at a friend's house.  My friends suggested that we drink, and, not wanting them to know that I had never really done that before, I agreed to join them.  It was great -- so great that I decided we should all pile in my car, and drive over to another friend's house.  I had a bunch of peppermint schnapps there and I was flying around in the backyard like an airplane and then -- next thing I knew, I was dry heaving on the bedroom floor.  My friends were on the phone with poison control: turns out they didn't drink either.  My dad came over, picked me up, and took me to the hospital.  I remember the nurse at the hospital recommending that I check out AA.  Ha.  So next morning, my dad cooked me eggs and toast and told me not to do that anymore.  I did, though.  Me and a few other guys, we would get shitfaced almost every weekend.  It was great: I had this problem in highschool -- I felt like I didn't belong.  Everyone I spoke to was either too cool for me, or not cool enough.  I couldn't figure it out how to do this life shit.  I got nervous around girls, I got nervous around guys -- it just wasn't working for me.  But alcohol did the trick.  I felt secure, and my head stopped racing.  I could laugh with ease and comfort, joke, bullshit, and not worry what "they" were thinking about me.  So hey, it worked.  Yeah, I was "that guy" at parties -- but I was at parties!  Before I started drinking, I didn't go to parties.  I puked everywhere -- in girls purses, on $3,000 sofas, in cars, parking lots, restaurants, hotels -- I left little bits of my DNA all over South Florida.  And I was embarassed about it, especially the next morning.  I remember one morning, I woke up at this girls house, and I saw this trail of bright orange puke leading into the bed (no, it wasn't her bed, it was her brother's -- and no, he wasn't in it).  I silently snuck out of the house and drove off.  The next day, in school, the girl asked me what the hell I had done -- why had I puked Doritos all over the place and then not stayed around to clean it up?  I couldn't give her a satisfactory answer.  Guess I'm just like that, I told her.  But I wasn't.  That wasn't me.  Anyway, that kind of thing happened a lot.  Woke up in my backyard sleeping on the Wall Street one morning, woke up with cuts and bruises occasionally, but it was all in good fun.  Sometimes, I would get perscriptions of Xanax, and I would take pills in school -- but I was able to function, I was able to get relatively good grades.  Good enough that I got into a college in the Northeast.  So off I went: headed for Philadelphia.  When I arrived there, I discovered that there was a beer delivery service.  These people actually *delivered* beer to your front door!  It was fabulous.  They didn't ID, either.  So I set about ordering beer on an almost daily basis.  But the greatest part about it all was that almost everyone else was doing it too!  Yeah, there were a few losers who didn't drink, but most of the people around me were into it.  Then they started to get into going to class, and I really wasn't that interested.  I thought drinking was way more interesting.  I started drinking Bacardi 151 alone in my bedroom at night, playing Flight Simulator on the computer for hours.  My new friends would stop by and say, "Rob, why don't you come hang out?" and usually, I'd tell them no, I was taking it easy.  Then, when I got drunk enough, I'd head out.  I'd do things like fall asleep in the snow, or walk into the baseball house and spit on the baseball players.  These guys were bigger than me, and they didn't like being spit on.  I wouldn't remember these things in the morning: people would come up to me and say, "dude, what happened with you last night?", and I'd say, "I don't know, why?", and they'd say, "you were a real asshole", or "you were hilarious!"  Either way, I had no recollection of it.  So my life felt crazy, but I kept thinking that one of these days, I was going to get this thing right.  Drinking was definitely helping my life.  When my girlfriend of a year dumped me right before winter break, my first thought was: it's okay.  I've got a perscription of Xanax in the bathroom cabinet -- 5 refills.  I can get through this.  So I went home, and started popping the Xanax (which were perscribed to help me with my fear of flying).  They worked, better than I had expected -- not only did I get over the girl, but I also got into relationships with several new girls, all at virtually the same time!  I wasn't at all afraid of them, either.  Yeah, the Xanax made it seem a little dull, but I thought that was neat: I was like a rock star, numb to the world and living in drama.  I went back to college, and I took the Xanax with me.  I managed to string the supply out for about four months -- at first, I was taking only a few pills a day, but by the end, I was taking about 10 a day.  During this time, I got into a new relationship with a nice young girl who went to the all girl's school next door.  When I ran out of Xanax, I started to panic.  I remember, it had been about 12 hours since I'd taken my last pill, and I was trying to cross the street.  It was evening, and I was looking at a car approaching, about 500 feet away.  Suddenly, while I was in the middle of the street, the car was right next to me!  I screamed and sprinted across the street.  When I looked back, I saw that the car was still about 300 feet away.  This scared me.  I told my friend about it -- he told me I may be going through withdrawal.  Of course, it was too early for that -- I know that now -- and I was just scared.  But then, it seemed like a real possibility, so I broke down and called my dad.  I told him what I was doing, and he got me connected with a psychiatrist in the area who helped me withdraw from the pills.  Within a few weeks, I had switched to a new drug: GHB.  This stuff gave me a drunken feeling, but I didn't get that sloppiness.  It worked well; the only problem was, I was told that if I took even just a little too much of it, I might have a seizure.  I started taking it every day, and I started to notice that while I was on it, time would suddenly disappear.  I would be sitting on the couch with friends, and then suddenly it would be nighttime and I'd be all alone on the couch, and the couch would bet wet.  I didn't know what was going on: all I knew was that I was falling asleep and pissing myself.  Then, one day, I was heading out with my new girlfriend and a couple of friends to a fair at her school.  I drank a bunch of GHB and got in the passanger seat of her car.  Suddenly, everything seemed very strange and I felt a burst of anger: the next thing I knew, I was in this fantastic dream where I was a character in an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel (Amory Blaine) and then I woke up and a paramedic was screaming at me, his knee jammed into my chest.  I was half naked, and I felt dirty.  I didn't know what was going on, and I started to cry.  The paramedic didn't show much love to me: I later found out that while seizing, I had punched him several times.  I spent the night in the hospital.  My dad flew up to stay with me.  Everyone asked me what I had done, and I finally broke down and told them.  I was still taking small amounts of Xanax to withdraw, and they were flabbergasted.  What was wrong with me, they asked.  Why was I taking drugs?  I didn't have an answer.  I promised I would stop.  The next few weeks were abismal: everyone I knew heard that I had overdosed, and I told them all that I was through.  But at night, I would sneak more GHB into my system.  When I stopped, I returned to drinking.  At least when I drank I didn't have seizures.  So summer came, and I was almost done withdrawing from the Xanax.  I went off to Europe with a friend, and it was a fiasco from the start.  I lost my money and my passport on the airplane; when I arrived in Frankfurt, I had to wait for four hours to get a temporary visa.  I finally connected with my friend, but within a week I had puked all over his stuff and I woke up one morning to him packing his bags.  We were in the Czech Republic, and he said he'd had enough of me.  So I was alone.  I panicked, and called my dad.  I told him I had to come home; he bought me a ticket on a flight leaving Frankfurt in three days.  So I headed back to Frankfurt: I got there, and I put myself up in the nicest hotel I could find.  I didn't have the money for it, but I figured I could get my dad to wire me money.  I couldn't leave the hotel -- I was too scared to go out.  So I drank, alone in the room.  On the second day, I woke up at around 2 in the afternoon to someone knocking on my door.  The hotel manager came in, and said that they needed me to pay for the previous two nights.  I told him I would have to go to the Western Union to get his money: he said that probably wouldn't work, and moments later, two large German policeman came in.  They arrested me.  I told them I could get the money, if they just gave me a chance.  They finally agreed, and took me over to the train station, where there was a Western Union.  I walked in, flanked by these cops, and I gave them my name: they had the money, and they gave it to me.  I was so relieved.  I went back to the hotel and paid them, then I called my dad and told him about it.  I thought he would find it funny.  He didn't.  I got back to the states, and started working for my dad doing yardwork.  I got into smoking pot, and I would do that every day while working.  It was great: I felt free.  I got back to school that fall, and I knew all about weed.  I started dealing, and everybody loved me.  That lasted a few months -- then I couldn't deal anymore, because I started to get paranoid.  I stopped, and so most of my friends disappeared.  I returned to drinking heavily.  One night, I was going to a formal with my girlfriend.  I drank far too much Jack and Coke, and when we were headed out, I got in an argument with her.  I was in the Quad at the all girls school, and I started screaming at her.  A security guard walked up, and I put my arm around him.  I don't remember what happened after that: all I know is that I ended up back in her room.  We were sitting there, when the door opened and four men in uniform came in.  I thought they were more security guards, so when they grabbed me, I tried to shake them off.  They pepper sprayed me, and carted me off to jail.  In the police car, I began to cry, and I tried to eat my fake ID.  It was laminated.  I walked home from jail at about 7 the next morning.  I was all dressed up, dirty and depressed.  When I got to my place, I got a call from one of the deans.  She said they had heard about the "incident": I was mandated to counseling.  I also had court charges pending -- nothing major; just drunken disorderly, underage drinking, and the like.  The counselor told me to go to AA.  He had a lazy eye, and I hated talking to him.  I promised him I wouldn't drink, and for a few weeks, I kept my promise.  Then I started stealing alcohol from my neighbors refridgerator, and painkillers that another one of my neighbors took for his leg.  I went to see a lawyer about the court charges, and he told me to stop drinking.  I told him I already had.  I tried again to stop -- and I made it for about a month and a half.  Then I went back to Europe, this time with my family, and the wine looked so good!  When my step-mom asked me why I was drinking again, I told her it was okay, I understood myself better.  I made arrangements to travel around Europe on my own, and I headed out.  It was great: I travelled around, carried a switchblade, bought hashish in the streets.  I got in a fight, lost a tooth, and slept with a hooker.  I jumped naked off of rocks into the ocean in Croatia with beautiful girls, and I roamed the streets of Amsterdam looking for vagrants to confide in.  I was able to do all those things, because I discovered in Europe that they give you Xanax with a perscription.  The next fall, I returned to school.  I was now worldly, and a junior.  Then, September 11th.  I had smuggled in about a thousand pills of Xanax from abroad, and when I heard the news, I started taking them in large quantities.  I got drunk, too.  I went to class that Tuesday night and told my professor that the reason I was so drunk was because I'd lost an uncle and a brother in the towers.  I didn't have an uncle or a brother in the towers.  I started to black out for days at a time.  I stopped taking care of myself physically, and I started going to class drunk all the time.  Then I stopped going to class.  I started ordering drugs from Pakistan on the internet.  Over Christmas break, they arrived at my house, and my step-mom asked why I was getting packages from Pakistan (this was during the anthrax scare).  I told her I had a friend who needed paperwork from a college there: when she asked why the packages said "Rx", I admitted that it was Xanax.  I had a problem.  But I wasn't going to talk to her about it.  I went back to school.  I wrecked my car several times -- once with three other people in it (I ran into a pole; sideways).  I couldn't go to class anymore.  I moved into a hotel, then I moved into the basement of one of the buildings nearby.  I couldn't talk to anyone anymore.  None of my friends wanted me around -- I was always drunk and violent.  There were no girls left, taking care of me.  I had one friend left: he tried to take care of me, to help me.  He would steal my alcohol and yell at me when I got beligerent.  He drove me around, he took my car to the shop after I wrecked it, then he cleaned it.  He told people I was a nice guy, that I just drank too much.  Of course it all made very little difference: I wasn't about to stop drinking.  I kept several bottles of Jack Daniels in the freezer.  I would always run out on Sunday, and where I lived, there were blue laws -- you couldn't buy alcohol on Sundays from liquor stores.  So I'd go to a bar and pay twice as much as I should for bottles, then I'd take them home and try to drink myself to sleep.  One morning, in early March, I woke up.  I had been in a blackout for several weeks, and suddenly I felt coherent.  I wanted to stop.  I knew that I couldn't -- knew that I wouldn't be able to leave my house if I wasn't drunk, knew that I couldn't sit in my room and not drink; knew that I was screwed.  My skin was on fire, I was pacing the hallway, thinking to myself: 'what do people do in this situation?  Nothing is wrong with me, but I'm going insane!'  So I decided to pray.  I got on my knees by my bed and asked somebody for help.  Then I drank again.  But within the next week, in a blackout, I e-mailed my parents.  I told them I needed help.  I called my dean and arranged for a medical leave of absence.  My mom told me she had already picked out a rehab near home.  So I got on a plane, and headed to my dad's house.  We planned to spend a week together, and then I would check in to rehab.  I made it the first day without drinking.  On the second night, I couldn't sleep and my body was shaking.  So I decided to have a glass of wine.  That turned into four bottles, and off I went in my dad's car, headed for a bad neighborhood.  I picked up a friend and we stayed out all night; I ended up passed out in a park.  He kicked me awake at around 4 in the afternoon and told me he wanted to go home.  When I got back to my house, my dad was livid.  He told me I was going to rehab the next day, and I did.  What happened next is coming soon... I can't believe you've read all this!
