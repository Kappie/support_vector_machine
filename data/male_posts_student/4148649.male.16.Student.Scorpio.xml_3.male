All his life, he had walked along a beach, and there were two sets of footprints in the sand. He had walked with God as long as he could remember, and the other set of footprints was His. He looked at the represented timeline, and suddenly noticed something odd - at each palce where a crisis and hard time occured in his life, there was only one set of footprints in the sand. Heartbroken, he turned to God and said, "God, why did you abandon me during my times of true need? For there is only one set of footprints in the sand during those times." God looked at the man and smiled sadly. "My child. I was with you always." The man replied insistently, "But there is only one set of footprints there!" "Yes," God answered, "During the times when you were the most needing, there I carried you."  Or something like that. Sometimes I have to remind myself that God is with me. Through troubling times in my life, spiritual, emotional, and physical lows. When I'm having a self-conflict over that girl... or maybe becoming lazy in my spirtual walk with God, or am keeping angry with a friend.  Always remember that once you know Him, God will never leave you - ever.
