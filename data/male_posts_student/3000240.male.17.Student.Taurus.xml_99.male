Myself because well, I put all my eggs in her basket so to speak. I know I shouldn't have done, but it's been so long, I guess anyone would have done the same wouldn't they?   Why though would she have done certain things after the things and excuses she's used? What exactly is it about me that has suddenly make her act like this all of a sudden. I'm beginning to understand why some men can never understand women. Us men do indeed have our flaws, but women are hardly innocent parties in it all.  Well, I guess there's a lot more time and people out there who are more suitable.   One thing that bothers me deeply is not to do with Jo, but I gave up men for quite a while because I lost faith in them, and now after the events of the last few days, I seem to have lost faith in women as well.   So who am I supposed to trust?   My friends have had a sordid history of letting me down so to speak, and I could tell by Frances' actions that she was hardly going to see that Argentinean film out of the pleasure of my company, merely as pay back for me doing a few of those shifts. I happened to have figured that out just before I turned into central avenue bus stop to see her waiting there, "tired". She's is sweet, my gosh yes, but I couldn't bare to look at her because I knew that the whole evening was just fake. Anna for instance, called me from Spain of all places, not to ask how I was, but to pathetically beg for me to add to her phone credit, because she couldn't get of her backside to find a job of her own. I mean I love Frances and Anna to pieces, but they are not my true friends.  I even called up the one person today who I really (like Jen) thought that about a year ago I would never befriend his kind of people, Ian, to see if I could drown my pitiful sorrows with him. Alas even he couldn't show me how much of a "best friend" he claimed to be but a fortnight ago. No, I can't take things out on old E, the thought of him just makes me giggle, and I know he's just about the most genuine person I know anyway.  No one ever seems to make a great effort to see more of me because they enjoy my presence, they never have, and they never will; I accept this yes, but what other contenders are there?  I still don't trust either of my parents after the coming-outgate, where once upon a time, my Dad was my hero, and I don't see or care enough of my siblings to even try with them. Harry is too young, and making new friends at college wouldn't be worth it as I figure they'll all just be replicas of the one's I have at the moment.  Bah, maybe I'm just too cynical, and my trust issues after Halliford were damaged irreversibly I guess, but I hate this waiting for a mutual loving companion, even at 17. My wish for a while now has been to settle down permanently, to properly help me recover from school. The parasites still haunt my dreams, which goes to show that they'll never leave me properly, so I put 2 + 2 together and a companion made 4. When will the confidence gamble ever pay of? xBuBzx
