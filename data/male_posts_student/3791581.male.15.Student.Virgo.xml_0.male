My momentary lack of cohesion is preventing me from posting anything entertaining... or maybe it's my dull lifestyle. Probably the latter =\.   Nothing much on my agenda for the next few weeks other than finding a job and studying for the PSATs so feel free to bother me. It'll give something to do. =)
