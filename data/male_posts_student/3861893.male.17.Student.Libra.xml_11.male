Allow me to give my two cents' worth.  Firstly, Real Madrid has developed this habit of buying star players to strengthen their squad. This sounds pretty true as teams usually like to strengthen their squad, right? Wrong! The truth is that Real Madrid buy players from teams which threatens their role as the king of European football. Here is my evidence:  Real bought Figo from Barcelona because Barcelona was considered a threat to them.  Real bought Zidane from Juventus because Juventus was considered a threat to them.  Real bought Ronaldo from Inter because Inter was considered a threat to them.  Real bought Beckham from Manchester United because Manchester United was considered a threat to them.  And, allow me to say this even though some may disagree with me, Real bought Owen from Liverpool because Liverpool was considered a threat to them.  Beware, Liverpool has awakened!  Secondly, I must say that this shows that players at Liverpool are not that bad after all. Owen is the second player to leave for Real Madrid in ten years. First it was Steve McManaman. Then now Owen. Which other clubs in the world can boast that it has two world class players leaving for Real Madrid? Let alone in a ten year period? Barcelona can almost claim that feat except that Zidane's move to Real was not direct. And what about Manchester United? Beckham was their only export. With all this, I rest my case.  Finally, allow me to end with the words of former Liverpool manager and Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish, "Liverpool had such a marvellous group of players. It was no surprise the trophies kept coming."
