They have the proverbial hammer to solve every problem. The world is far too complex to point at a single source of any problem. If you don't like the way things are being run in the country, the problem isn't one man (Bush). The problem isn't even three men (Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft). The problem is much larger, much more complex. Focusing the debate on one man doesn't solve the problem, because fixing that one thing won't fix the problem.   Take stock in the situation. The world changed on its own - Bush didn't change it and neither did Clinton. They don't have the power to do something like that. All they can do is be a player in the game.   Look at the game and figure out how to play it - don't focus so much on the players and figure out how to bring them down. The game will continue without them.
