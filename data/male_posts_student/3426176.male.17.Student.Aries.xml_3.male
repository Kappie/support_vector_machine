Some of the questions were confusing and the reading part took me a long time so I had to rush through the other questions a lot more than I had wanted to.  But all in all it was pretty good.  So that was it.  The 2003/2004 school year was over.  Arrivederci Junior year.  One more left.  Just one more year until... I don't know.  Summer break started the best way possible.  After I shamelessly promoted my blog, I walked out to my car to go home and do nothing.  Just then who do I see but Steve!  He needed a ride so I was more than happy to oblige.  He mentioned going to Mickey D's for breakfast and I figured why the hell not?  So we went, I had the Steak, Egg, and Cheese Bagel and he had the Two Breakfast Burritos.  When we left we saw Howie and Scott walk in.  We greeted them and Howie and I exchanged "man-hugs".  We went back to Steve's place where I watched him get the monkey feces beat out of him in  Ninja Gaiden  and then I joined him in playing an amusing round of  Halo.   It was hilarious when we were on the same team, but Steve kept killing me on purpose.  That's what friends are for.

Mr. W.K. has a genius plan of gaining weight that I have to try.  When he was a wee lad, his situation was similar to mine.  While everyone is trying to lose weight, we are trying to gain weight.  I won't lie to y'all.  I am freakishly skinny.  I am 5'9" and 113 lbs.  That's not too good.  So that's why I might do this strange diet plan.  It's the Sweet and Salty diet plan.  First, eat a lot of sweet stuff like candy and donuts and cake and stuff like that.  When you are full, or tired of sweets, eat salty stuff like potato chips and french fries.  When you are full of salty stuff, go back to sweets and just continue until you gain at least 20 pounds.  Just eat a helluva lot of unhealthy crap and you'll be set.  Well, that's all for now.  I'm looking forward to this weekend.  The Fire play at home against Colorado, and the Indy 500 and Coca-Cola 600 are on Sunday.  Yes, I'm hoping for a Fire win and two great races.  Talk to y'all tomorrow.  Bye. urlLink
