This silence kills the calm Of the night I force an anxious patience Counting every beat and waiting for my turn to die  Give it up, Give it up Don't fall for the same things Give it up, Give it up Don't fall for the mistakes that I've made Don't turn away  I understand your ways Won't give it up  It's not me you're waiting for Alright, stop waiting It's not me you're waiting for This is where it ends It's not me you're waiting for It's time to let go, time to let go And if you promise to forget I'll try to find a way to make the same mistakes  And when You become All you've lost Wandering the streets and searching for a place to die.  Check for new lyrics every once and a while, and be sure to come back to Blog of Bagel tonight for more stuff.
