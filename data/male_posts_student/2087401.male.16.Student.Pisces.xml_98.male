It's hilarious!!!  SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER!!!  omg, you soooo need to see it.  Anyway...Alice Laramore LOVES Pippin...so that's obviously a pretty good one. Anyway anyway, you thought I was hotter with long hair?  Really?  You're not the first guy to say that, actually...I just don't see it.  I thought I was kinda too normal-looking back then.  Sorry...we can stop talking about me and my hotness.  I just realized a few hours ago that I was simply irrisistable (lol just kidding) and wanted to share it with the world!!!   SQEE!
