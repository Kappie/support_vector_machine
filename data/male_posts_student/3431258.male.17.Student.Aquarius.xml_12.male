Took me some time to figure out where was the Linear Dodge Option. I know it look a bit crappy, just remember it's my first tutorial. A lot more coming soon!   Also i started some basic tutorials of Html as you can see now :        This part of my post is all typed in HTML!        Anyway, it started out easily, but i am sure it will get complicated. Played a bit of Zyphern's custom levels on Jumper. He needs practice at editing...  Regards,  Zephyr
