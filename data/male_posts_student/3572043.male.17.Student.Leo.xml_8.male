I am taking national exam on October, I have a project waiting for me to redo(yea, I messed up the last one), I have FFXI calling for me and I have not finished Super Robot Wars MX(Chapter 40 at the moment).   I traded my Radeon 9200 for my friend's Radeon 9800pro and it seems not working on my system(yes, I owe him some money too). Told him about it and he is willing to trade back our graphic cards. Thinking of saving money for Radeon 9600.  Okie, life is sux0r! Nubli and Fubuki(a friend) are using 'ung' instead of 'uck'! That means... "Fung you!" instead of what we know... Man, they sung...
