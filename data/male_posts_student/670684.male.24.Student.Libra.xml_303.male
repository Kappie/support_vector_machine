I need constant inspiration, a strong role in several organizations where I can see tangible results from my work, and hard work that leaves me tired at the end of the day, but excited to wake up and start the next.  Waiting tables is cool, and I love human interaction, but will that be enough for me when I put on my velvet black robe with the orange and white hood and receive my graduate degree?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I wrote little this summer, but what I wrote I believe was good, or on the right track, getting me to where I need to be.  I hold two screenplay ideas so strongly right now that I must work on both this semester...one is the project for the term, and the other is  Three Strikes , my first collegiate screenplay that made the right effort, but waxed too long in superfluous filth and never consummated the characters as was needed.  Reading Michael Lewis'  urlLink Moneyball , I found what my story was missing, the theoretical debate in baseball circles, the fight of the old school versus the new way of thinking about things...it's a great theme that was too weak in my original.  I wrote a few very good characters...if I can flesh out those who weren't as good, make Jay less of a villain and more of an opportunist, give Cheree and Luis more meat, and figure out how Sergeant Landry isn't just a one-trick pony, this shit could get sold.    Life is exciting.    Today:  Finding Nemo with mom, maybe some lunch at a restaurant, and then just hanging out.  My mom is cool, regardless of what social quirks and reclusive nature she exhibits.  Probably the most naively good person I can think of.  She doesn't see why people act badly, because she doesn't act badly.  She's liberal, but nothing compared to me...she'd vote Lieberman.  If any of you have 55-65 male friends/relatives/fellows who you know are single and like a woman who would rather watch soccer than do anything (and is the best cook I know, and this isn't just me being a good son who loves his mom's corn beef hash...ask around, the woman is fantastic in the kitchen...don't even take that innuendo where it could go), let us know.
