But fear not, those who read my weblog, I have returned. Let's see...what's been happening to me? Work, as I mentioned previously. Pretty much day-to-day stuff not worthy of note.  I read some books, how about that? yes, that works. Well, I read a nice book of the short stories of Voltaire, I picked up a big book of Sherlock Holmes stories, and just recieved a couple days ago the new U.S. edition of Don't Panic. And a freind of mine at the library was nice enough to library bound that one for me, now it's all shiny.  Why do I have a weblog, you ask yourself, if I don't post for a month? I should ask you the same thing.  \wowthatdidntmakeanysense
