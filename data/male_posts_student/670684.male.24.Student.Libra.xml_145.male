Now, I won't pretend to know what Poland is thinking (and I won't rehash the old 1995 love tryst with Julie Poland that resulted in me getting a hug...but no one remembers that Jesse Hopkins tried to *steal* her away from me at one point), but I can play grabass with the United States.  And there are two camps out there on why we're at war...      1)  We're at war because it is proven that Saddam has WMD/Saddam has ties to terrorism/Saddam hates puppies and freedom      2)  George Bush said so.    I am firmly entrenched in #2.  If you are in #1, I won't try to turn you to my camp.  All I want is the evidence that puts you in #1.    Protests in Austin today...about 2000 people showed up and blocked traffic near 24th and Guadalupe, chanting  1,2,3,4, we don't want your fucking war!   While I am not a great fan of American protests, this was the best one I've seen so far because it stopped traffic and caused people to recognize what was happening.  However, all they did was stop traffic.  How do we go from that to stopping war?    If anyone is looking for a picture of the Chinese activist I talked about yesterday, there is a link to a  urlLink blurb  about him...hit the top link.  Picture later.
