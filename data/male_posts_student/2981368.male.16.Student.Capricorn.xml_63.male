They're re-arranging the monkey team, leaving just me, de Dijker (cool Dutch guy) and Roy "Starkiller" Pitchford. So me happy that I'm in the top 3. Woooooo-ooo-oooo. I am teh l33715H bannerman.  2. Gave in that application form thingo at Almondsbury GC, and guess what? About 20 minutes later, they phoned. talk about fast response...any quicker and I would have still been getting home. So I now have a job. Which I'm rather chuffed about. (whooopee-yayness).  More reasons why today ruled later. Now football.
