I have just felt real overwhelmed by work and school and things and just haven't found the time..  But i do promise I will start updating it at least every other day so there will be more fun things to be learned...  BUt the jayhawks are in the final four with a good chance at winning it so things are much better indeed...  Alright peace out kids...
