I haven't really had much of a chance to mess with the new features since I am at school right now, but from what I have read, they sound promising. I can now remove my "About" and "Colophon" posts and replace them with separate pages, and perhaps even change to Blogger commenting rather than HaloScan. (I wonder how many people HaloScan will lose now.) So, everyone can expect many changes in the following week or so, which is nothing out of the ordinary for my blog.
