However, within each room, the seating arrangement is randomized, not sequential. Not only that, the randomization is done for every exam! So you sit at a different place in the same room in different exams. So, there is obviously a 'great deal of trust' that the authorities place on the students here.         Today's Org. Behaviour exam was based on material covered in classes, rather than from any particular book. This obviously caused a lot of problems for many people who hadn't gone through the class presentations. But I had somehow felt this would happen, and so, we (some three-four people) had gone through the slides together, while reading only a few parts from the book. And we managed to do pretty well today.        As for tomorrow, it is doubtless the toughest test among the seven - Accounting. There are lots of situations that come to mind where you can't think of a proper accounting treatment (because of ignorance) and this has created a lot of confusion. Let's see what happens tomorrow.
