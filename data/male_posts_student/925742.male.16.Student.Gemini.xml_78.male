Because I want to emphasize that they followed their fear of death and belief of Gods everywhere.  Though it is very prophetic. Hell, they were just kidding themselves.  The only real justice had then was when the legionnares busted out those fucking catapults.  Tight as fuck.  Mood:  Angry.. I have to do homework, but I wan't to play Neverwinter Nights. Music: Dj Paul Van Dyk - Techno Energy  Time to bust out that X, cuz I'm into takin' drugs.
