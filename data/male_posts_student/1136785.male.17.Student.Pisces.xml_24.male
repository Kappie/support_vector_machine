I know it was cruel of me to leave you dear readers without your daily Tyson fix - that the shock sent you into withdrawl not too unsimilar from that of a heroin addict. But there was no other option. I needed to feel like I was working and/or studying.   But now all my APs are over, as are my interviews for the OHP. I still need to write the damned thing, but the hard part is over. As for my APs, they were mostly blah. None of them were too hard, even World History. The annoying thing on that one is that the DBQ asked my what other documents would be useful. WHAT THE HELL! They're supposed to be proving me with documents to answer the fucking question - thats why it is called a Document Based Question! Don't be lazy and pretend that there is not many documents relating to Pre and Post 520 CE Tang China, because I know theres more than six! Lazy shits, all of you. The real suprise, however, was my Latin AP. What was supposed to kill me only mildly molested me, and even took me to dinner and a movie. Came completely out of left field. What didn't though, was  Troy . What a shitty shitty movie. Only Jackson is apparently capable of putting together a successful epic.   I do have one more thing to say related to school work. My Oral History Project, or OHP, kind of hit a brick wall - I had no one to interview and it was due monday. I was freaking out, and I kept trying to call the local chapter of the NAACP but they wouldn't answer. My only other option was just waltzing into some Retirement Village and harassing old people for info about whatever. But I had a lucky break this morning - I saw that in Topeka, there was a massive NAACP convention celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of Brown vs Board of Education. I wanted to do Civil Rights, as that was also my term paper. So I quickly siezed the oppurtunity (after wasting as much time as I could pleading for other people to join me on my whirlwind and presumably zany adventure to far-off Topeka), bought a micro cassete recorder, and drove to Topeka. After eating next-door to the hotel at a traditional traveling Carnival, I went in and spent roughly 45 minutes building up enough courage to talk to anyone. Finally, I approach two women, and then an eighty year old minister. I even got to meet Jesse Jackson along the way. Sweet ass! I'm still seeing if theres any possible of getting to interview him as the minister knew him fairly well, but somehow I doubt it.  One more bit of info. Yale sent me an email demanding money for their program - their little way of telling me that I've been accepted. Holy crap. I'm going to be spending ten weeks in New Haven learning Arabic. No summer for Tyson - it begins May 31st, roughly two days after school ends. I'll be there until August 6th. People are questoning my sanity for embarking on such a course, and I am as well - but I'm a little excited in a bizarre way. I am depressed that I won't be spending any time with my friends, and that I'll get to go through the typical "Tyson is in a new situation" game I've come to know and love every summer. You see kids, whenever I'm thrown into one of these camps, I typically make an ass out of myself as soon as possible. Its unavoidable - hey, I know I'm rough around the edges. Quite suddenly I become the person everyone hates. Its not really that bad - one gets used to it. I'm not too worried about it as it will give me plenty of time to be alone and think this summer. I'm faintly looking foward to the imposed social isolation - more time for much needed introspection into the nature of my self, no worries about whether I'm doing enough with people, no nothing. I forsee a summer where I will be somewhat depressed and invariably amused and I have no problem with that. Beside, I really do want to learn Arabic - for future plans I can speak little of.   Summer of my Junior year..Junior year is over. I'm going to be a senior. Its astounding. I remember turning to Hunt Bascom like the first week of my freshmen year during lunch and going "Hunt! When the hell did we get into High School?!" And here I am, reaching the final year of it. I'm not sad - Junior year was a good year. There was ups and downs - nothing special. I grew to know and love many more people than I did before, which is always a good thing according to some people. I wonder if this is how I will feel on my death bed. But thats assuming I will have one.   I'm not in the mood to post anything but superficialities, as I'm still debating the nature of my character. If one really wants to know me, read  In the Lake of the Woods . We read it this year as out last book in english - fairly quick read, excellent novel. O'Brien essentially throws into disregard the fundermentality of the modern novel. The part that frightens me so much is how so much of it hit close to home, how much of it I identified with. If you read it, you will understand. Off to more important things.   Boring, yet Important   As strange as it may seems, the last three weeks have been a great victory for Democracy. Not democracy as in the free world, but Democracy as in the platonic form, the abstract concept. India has finally tallied up the votes in its recent election, in which nearly half a billion people voted.  Roughly 400 million of India's 670 million eligible voters participated in this national election - which is actually a low turn out for India. There was also a record low in voting related deaths - only 48! One must find a victory where one can in the world's largest democracy.  The formerly ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was certainly looking for one. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee called these elections six months early - a move that has most certainly backfired and amounted to near poltical suicide. His advsisors convinced him to ride off the soaring economic growth India was experiencing (an astounding 8%!), good monsoon season, and the fairly successful new peace inititave with Pakistan. Emboldened by a good showing in the state elections last December, he agreed. But in what supposedly should have been a fairly solid victoy, BJP lost more than 40 of its 182 seats in the lower house - enough so that BJP and its allies no longer form the majority. The major opposition party, Congress, having finally conceded to the needs for allies and coaliton goverments, now holds the majority. This is a stunning victory for Congress, and its leader Sonia Gandhi. Congress has apparently won on the back of the silent majority, which in India is made of the extreme poor. Nearly one half of India's one billion people still live on less than one dollar a day, have poor fresh water access, little sanitation, and couldn't care less about the latest call centers. They have seen little of the supposed rewards from India's economic prosperity and demand change. Read more about the election at my favorite  urlLink source .  Mrs. Gandhi, born in Italy, is a member of a massive political dynasty. She is the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru who had taken over as leader of Congress from Mahatma Gandhi. Her former husband was Rajiv Gandhi, India’s prime minister from 1984 until his assassination in 1989. Before Rajiv, his mother, Indira Gandhi, ruled the country for majority of the time since the mid-60s. Sonia and Rajiv's son, Rahul Gandhi, has also recently entered the family business, doing very well in the state elections in December in Uttar Pradesh for Congress where he ran. And after some mulling and debate, she  urlLink will be the country's next prime minister .   As for what this means for India is anyone's guess. Congress is part of a leftist coalition that includes substantial Communist parties. A broad coalition is unlikely to prove too radical, but also too stable as well. Congress is stated as supporting continuing India's economic growth, and therein lies a major question. The great success of Mr. Vajpayee and the BJP has been the dismantling and reform of India's clumsy and stagnating socialist system that has held it behind for so many years. State industries are being privatised, and the fiscal deficit is being decreased, and competion is being fostered. It seems like it may be against Party and leftist principle for the Congress led coaliton to continue these programs, and stock markets have already sank in the anticipation that economic reform will halt. Yet even long time Communists are capable of compromise - in the state of West Bengal, a communist dominated state for fifty years despite relentless economic stagnation, the Communist Party has taken a move that would shock most rightist govements. It has classified information technology and related services as public utilities. Strikes are banned. All in the name of economic progress. Hopefully, more attention paid to the impovershied aspects of India seeking their own fortune should encourage reform rather than stunt it.   As for the rest of the world, a whole other question is opened. There has been political consensus around the peace with Pakistan so that at least can fortunately expected to continue. One interesting outcome may be in the form of Israel. BJP had a pro-Israel stance and was persuing strategic relations with Tel Aviv. Congress, along with its many muslim supporters and other Indian circles, were not nearly as interested in that idea. It is unlikely that relations with be severed, but not tightened either. Congress also has held a fairly ambivalent stance towards the USA, which can range from accepting to scorn. In the past it has voice distrust in American interests in India. The Communist Party of India or CPI (not to be confused with the other communist party, Communist Party of India Marxist or CPI-M) has rumbled that the Pro-U.S. foreign policy of the BJP be scrapped immediately upon the takeover of the Congress led coalition. Little has been heard from Washington, which is much to busy with Iraq and the prisoner mess to focus on India at the moment.   Sonia Gandhi is claiming "I will change India". Lets hope for better and not worse, but frankly I'm not so sure.   Update  Sonia Gandhi has now suprisingly declined the position of Prime Minister. In a tearful announcement to a shocked Congress, she said she decided it was the best way to protect Congress from attacks on her Italian origin. MPs from Congress pleaded with her to change her decision, but she remain firm. Markets have taken an upswing to the announcement, and to the fact that Manmohan Singh, architect of India's modern economic reforms, may become Prime Minister instead. Read more  urlLink here .   Emma's Good News Journal   -When Joseph Beyrle escaped from a German prison camp during World War II, he was rescued by a Soviet tank unit. For the next month he fought alongside his new comrades, the only soldier to serve in both the U.S. and Soviet armies. Last week, Beyrle, now 80, was formally honored in Moscow at the annual Victory Day celebration in Red Square. Veterans took turns being photographed with him, and Mikhail Kalashnikov, who invented the AK-47, gave Beyrle one of his assault rifles. "Let it serve as a symbol of the friendship between two peoples!" Kalashnikov said.

A piloted rocket plane has blasted through the earth's atmosphere becoming the first privately funded vehicle to reach the edge of space. Manned by Mike Melvill, a 62-year-old test pilot, the teardrop-shaped rocket made a 55 second climb to 211,400ft (40 miles) before free-falling to a near perfect landing at Mojave airport, about 80 miles north of Los Angeles in California.

In return, the U.K. has joined the U.S. Clean Energy Initiative and announced joint partnerships with Germany to promote sustainable, affordable energy services in the developed and developing world. REEEP is a coalition of progressive governments, businesses, and organizations committed to accelerating the development of renewable and energy efficiency systems. Initiated at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in August 2002 by the U.K. government, the REEEP provides an open and flexible framework within which governments work together to meet their own sustainable energy objectives according to their own timetables.

Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said this week that the govermnt would start giving cash bonuses to women for having more babies. Every baby born after June 30 will net its mother $2,000. The new incentive was unveiled in an election year budget that Australian papers have dubbed the "erection budget." Costello said the measure is neccessary to ensure that Australia will continue to produce enough taxpayers to support the aging population. "You go home and do your patriotic duty tonight," he told reporters. Costello, a father of three, said three was the ideal number of kids: "One for your husband, one for your wife, and one for your country."  That last one makes me wish I could find a girl as 'patriotic' as me. Ah, the fevered dream of a madman. I'm coughing up a storm, so I'm off to hopefully get less sick and to write an OHP. Good day.
