IT'S not pretty to say that one desires beauty, so Singaporeans shy away from admitting looks are important. Nearly everyone (98 per cent) polled in the latest Sunday Times Poll claimed to be happy with his or her looks and that looks don't matter.But if given the chance to change one thing about themselves, 60 per cent would grab it. On the wish list: a flatter stomach, a slimmer figure and more toned muscles.  Mr Peter Lee, managing consultant of an executive search firm, said: 'It's still politically incorrect to admit that looks are important because that's 'superficial'. But no matter what, people like to deal with attractive people.'  The social stigma of being seen to be over-concerned about looks means that plastic surgeon Martin Huang needs to tread carefully when he meets patients at parties.  'About 80 per cent of them ignore me and pretend that they don't know me. This is why I never acknowledge patients in public, especially high-profile ones, unless they acknowledge me first, so that their privacy is protected.'  Of the representative sample of 438 people surveyed by Singapore Press Holdings' research arm, 42 per cent reckon that good-looking people have an easier life.  About 80 per cent say that being blessed with big eyes, flawless skin and a toned body means that one is more likely to nail a job than a plain Jane or average Joe.  Some 60 per cent think good looks are important in getting a promotion. Human resource specia-lists agree.  Mr Lim Kian Kok of Mercer Human Resource Consulting said: 'The reality is that we'll be biased towards attractive-looking people.'  At job interviews, first impressions always count. Human resource manager Esther Chia of recruitment agency Kelly Services, said: 'Good looks give one a foot in the door.'  Social psychologists have found that interviewers decide within 15 seconds if someone is right for a job. Another study has found that when identical resumes are presented with different photographs, the unattractive ones are less likely to be shortlisted.  The companies interviewed said that if they discriminate by looks, it has to do with the positions. Cosmoprof, which manages spas such as those in Fullerton and Goodwood Park hotels, will not hire anyone who is overweight or has a bad complexion as a guest relations officer.  Its manager, Ms Angie Soon, said: 'They have the responsibility of greeting our guests, and thus are required to look attractive.'   Even firms that are not in such beauty-conscious businesses admit that all else being equal, they would choose a more attractive candidate over a plainer one. Mr Alick Chia, managing director of SKF Logistics Services Asia, said: 'Human instinct would lead us to pick the better-looking one. Looks may also translate into more confidence.'   Polytechnic graduate Susan Cheong, 22, knows what this cost her. She had six interviews in the two months after she graduated, but was never once shortlisted, though her peers found work quickly. She said frankly: 'I'm obese and not pretty. People in the human resource industry tell me I need to lose weight if I want to work in the corporate field.'  Now an administrator with a non-profit organisation, she said: 'When I look at job ads, I automatically rule out those that want 'pleasant-looking' people. It means 'young and pretty'.'   Psychiatrist Lionel Lim said he sees four or five patients a year who suffer from depression or anxiety because they were bypassed for jobs or promotions, owing to their looks.  Some choose plastic surgery. Dr Huang said the number of clients who seek his help before going for job interviews has doubled in the last two to three years.  Firms insist that though looks may play a role, what ultimately counts are attitude and capability. This is good news for Miss Cheong, who is determined to fight on her own terms. She said: I believe my attitude will pull me through.'    If you ask me, i feel that how you look does not stop me from befriending you, but for me i feel obligated to look good,or the best of my ability,to keep up with my horrendous appearance ! its just that the society is shallow nowadays and it will be getting worse in time to come i guess.    Many peeps think that if you are good looking, then you are a really shallow and a proud person. Not true. Take me for example. Hahah just kidding !! No lah...haha...really kidding, im jus the average joe lah... but i do know of people who are good looking and yet are very nice people...just that they have more self-confidence and thus that is what people nowadays are looking for right ? (hope it makes sense)I have friends who are modelling type and they are quite nice people. really.But,there are also quite a number of people who are are blessed with good looks but have a proud and shitty attitude. so, i guess you would have to know the person before you comment then,and that's what i always do.   Im just that teenage boy, with  hair that NEVER does what i say, with oily face that is...well...oily,and although i am not fat i FEEL fat.Then if thats the case,in the first place i should not have lost weight and take up a strict exercise regiment, beacuse i still feel fat before and after i lose weight ! I spoke to my mum about it(about my mental problem bout being fat), and she said i am retarded. Hahaha kidding la ! she said i am already skinny enough(Since when did anyone say that to me ??!!) and if i continue to go on the strict routine, i will become underweight. i told her if it is even possible for me to be underweight that is, then i will see how. So now she's like forcing me to eat lots ! gosh !the last thing i ever need !   Btw, i just realised, that i can go without food for the whole day without feeling hungry at all ! wow ! amazing right ?? it so happened that yesterday i had a whole day filled with activities from the time i woke up till night, so i didnt really eat until like seven, and then i was still not hungry then even after running 2km!  but i forced myself to eat for fear that i would die from malnutrition or what...hahah...will try it again tomorrow ! just drink my soya bean and everything will be alright !  will be running @ bedok reservoir tomorrow afternoon with my dear friend Karin. Cant wait to run ! love the scenery there man !(and the eye-candys even more!)  K la, hav to go to school tmr. go zzz now...oh ya got any comments pls write down okay ? thanks guys ! goodnight !
