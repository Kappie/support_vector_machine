I'm deeply ambivalent about this stance, but I can't really think of a way to address the principal problem of enforcement being impossible so cerebrally I'm somewhat inclined to agree.  It--making certain kinds of performance enhancing drugs legal in sports--just feels wrong though. Gateway drugs, impressionable youth. To be elaborated on later.
