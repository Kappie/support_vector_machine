Ahh. I have finished the two books I brought. I am gonna review them.  Firstly, The Five People You Meet In Heaven by Mitch Albom. Wow! The book is fantastic. It keep me hooked throughout the end. The book teaches us 5 important live lessons. The first one is that  there is a balance to everything. Like our friend falls ill, but we don't. It not a coincidence. One withers, another grows.  The second one is that  sacrifice is part of life. When you sacrifice smething, you are not losing it, You are just passing it onto someone else.   The third lesson is that  holding anger is a poison. We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. The harm we do, we do to ourselves.   The fourth and five lesson I neer really quite knew. I gathered that  love and memories don't die . I also inferred that  our place on Earth has a meaning. Our jobs, what we do, is a special contribution to everything.  This bvook is so enriching. I even thought about it during a show, when one of the characters asked "Why him? Why not me?" (forgot which show le...I think Ben Yue). The most important life lesson covered by this book was that  all lives intersect, in one way or another. All our actions affects some other people in a special way, even simple mudane things like picking up the rubbish. The each affects the other as the other and the other affects the next, and the world is full of stories, but the stories are all one.   (Note: italicised texts are excerpts from the book and some of my own inferences from reading this book.) I find it a very beautiful book that I would turn to again and again. I recomend everybody to buy this and discover yourself and the world. I rate this book 4.5 out of 5 stars.   The other book is The Wish List by Eoin Colfer (author of the Artemis Fowl books). This is a story about Meg redeeming herself brownie points to go up to heaven. She died due to a gas explosion, and surpirse surprise. She was dead even on the good and bad points, meaning going neither to Heaven (the Pearlies, they call that) or to Hell (the pits). Saint Peter and Brezelbub was featured. Heh heh. In order to accumulate brownie points, she had to help an old man fulfill his wish list before he dies. On that list were some outrageous things like kissing his old flame (whom he never got to kiss) and kicking a football way above the goal post. HaHa. This story is humorously funny as the two incompatible pair fulfill the tasks on the list, with some obstacles from Hades (he wants the girl in Hell). There are funny scenes about Heaven and Hell (Saint Peter was grumbling about being stuck as the gatekeeper "If he was such a big shot holy saint, how come he has to sit outside the gates all the time while the rest of them enjoyed the fruits of heaven?Why couldn't James ever take a turn? Or John? Or Judas?"). Heh heh. Wish List is a great book if you want to brighten up your day. I recomend it for anyone, really. I rate this book 3.5 out of 5 stars.   Ehh... hmm. Today also another boring day la. Doing nothing also. I found out that the Survivor Finale is gonna be aired on next Monday, from 10pm to 1am tuesday. Oh my!! I must sleep in the afternoon to conserve and charge up my energies. Therefore, I must sleep late on Sunday and do a lot of strenous work on Monday (a-ha! clean the whole house!). What a hassle. However, I'll do anything for my Survivor.   Okay. Gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Bye blog!
