However, when she has her car (whatever time that may happen) she probably would want to see me again.  The problem lies ahead, between now and then.  I don't know if i'm going to meet someone else, and what If I end up hurting Carrie myself?  I'd hate myself if that happened.  She said "if you want to see other people, I guess that's okay" now if I look at this carefully, I know she'd be somewhat hurt if that happened.  Sigh, but I haven't picked a direction yet.  I don't know what's going to happen, I guess this is how life keeps moving.
