Standing on a chair, nope.  Not quite tall enough . Asks for help, with his unheard, irrelevant voice.. maybe the toddler cries.  But those who see his attempts to get just  one simple cookie , one little thing that he'd like to even be temporarily happy, those people see him plea and shrug it off.   He only wants some attention, those cookies mean nothing to him.   What.. if that cookie did? He wants to be happy, that lil kid.. Just give him what he wants.. this once? What is this an analogy to? I'm not telling...
