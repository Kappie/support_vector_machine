There were the really depressing ones, one of the commercials (there were only two) was a kid, 5 years old perhaps, sitting on a street curb by a park. And the stoned person didn't pick him up ('cause he's fuckin' stoned). Stoned or not, the commercial really makes you put three fingers to the tip-top of your lips and say, "Oh shit, that's what I forgot.". The second one was kind of stupid, it really didn't make you think about anything. It was a grave on the side of the road and a man comes to the grave. Cheer up, ya stoned fucker, go smoke more mary!  This article is not good for children, shield their eyes! Get the fuck off the internet! Do something you fucker! For christ's sake call the FCC, oh, what the fuck does the FCC have to do with the internet! Okay, this little "goodbye" note is getting out of hand.
