Very Andy go chair debates for 3 days with Adro. think about it, how fun can it possibly be to CHAIR a debate for 3 days *sigh* (yes i'm going to the use the sigh). Anyway this holiday has been so useless. I should be doing science booklets for gondek but i'm just to lazy. Maybe if i change my work ethic, this holiday won't be so boring from now on. Nah. Not state the obvious or anything, but this blog is dying. Somebody come up with something new and exciting to make it good (don't mock my lack of vocabulary). Did i mention that:     I'm so seriously bored it's not funny     Yeah i think you got that. As you can see i'm blogging out of boredom which is probably not a good sign.  P.S Very Jack, post the short version of "beware of greeks and their corner kicks" on your blog and paste the fat version on ours
