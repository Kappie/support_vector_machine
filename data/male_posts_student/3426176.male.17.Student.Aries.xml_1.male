I decided to stay up and watch the game, which I did.  (Quick recap: L.A. destroyed Dallas 4-1.  A player I don't like, Steve Jolley, had a game to forget.  He blocked a cross with his jollies [pun intended], headed the ball into his own goal, and deflected a Jovan Kirovski shot into his own goal.  Kirovski received credit for the goal, but it really should have been another own goal by Steve Jolley.  Sasha Victorine, Jolley (o.g.), and Kirovski [2 goals, one from the penalty spot] scored for Los Angeles and Ronnie O' Brien scored for Dallas.) Staying up past 02:30 reminded me of when I woke up at 01:30 to watch the 2002 World Cup everyday.  I would stay awake most of the time and watch the games while everyone else in the house was sound asleep.  I remember this one time where I was up from 01:30 and watched all three games (including the game where Italy dominated Equador 2-0) and fell back asleep around 08:30.  I woke up when my mom came home from work at 14:30.  That's 2:30 PM for those of you who don't speak European.  I know some of you are saying, "2:30 PM?  I wake up at that time every day!"  Well, I don't.  If I could I would.  It's just that my mum usually wakes me up around 09:30 (for no good reason) and if she doesn't I can't sleep past 10:30.  Yes, everyone laughed at me and ridiculed me for sacrificing much needed sleep for the beautiful game.  I swear, that whole month I had to have gotten a grand total of about 15 hours of sleep.  Most of it during the day.  I was going to sleep late today, but I figured that since I didn't get to watch the Fire game I could watch the replay online.  Well they weren't showing it.  They weren't even showing the highlights.  I was not happy.  I woke up at 08:00 for nothing then.  I decided to stay awake and watch tennis so it wasn't so bad.  Xavier Malisse advanced to the round of 16 while Virginia Ruano Pascual lost in the third round. (or was it the fourth round?)  So with my Fire game watching hopes dashed, I waited for the Indy 500.  It was raining over there.  Damn, now I have to wait out a super long rain delay.  They got the race started about 2 hours late and ran about 25 laps when the rain started again.  Bloody hell.  I just have no luck.  They were close to getting it back under way, but I had to go with my mom and dad to my grandmum's house (the good grandmum) for a while.  After that we went shopping and I got some Chinese Fooooooood (and then?) for myself and went home.  By the time we were home, the Indy 500 was well over.  Buddy Rice won, which meant that David Letterman (yes the talk show host) won his first Indy 500 as an owner.  Quick Rant:  For some reason, my mum and dad have been taking me along on their endless shopping excursions and when they go they play this  Ultimate Manilow  CD.  Now, it takes alot for music to aggravate me and I was OK with it... FOR THE FIRST 40 FRIGGIN' TIMES!!!  Bloody Hell!  They play this every single waking moment of the day.  And it's all of that sappy love song crap, which I can remotely get into on very rare occasions, but not every damn day.  Jesus H. Christ.  So we got home and the Coca-Cola 600 was already past half way done.  I didn't miss much considering Jimmie Johnson was annihilating the whole field.  So I watched the end of the race while I munched on Moo Goo Gai Pan and my Egg Rolls. (why does that sound dirty?) Jimmie Johnson deservedly won the race.  He made this sick nasty pass where he slipped between a lapped car and Kasey Kahne in the middle of a turn.  He must drive on the expressway alot.  I think I'm getting sick again so I better go and get some sleep.  I really need it.  I have practice tomorrow at 13:00 on Fedora Field.  That's 1:00 PM for those of you who don't speak European.  And Fedora Field is what Pat and I named the practice field.  I want to call the stadium Spellman Stadium, but Pat doesn't like it.  I do.  It's an honour to have the stadium named after you.  More honourable than a practice field.  Anyway, off I go.  Bye.
