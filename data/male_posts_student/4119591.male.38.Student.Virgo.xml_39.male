They're already selling T-shirts, coffee mugs, beach towels and Ewok dust covers with the new logo. Get yours now before it's too late or they change the name again.   I thought of some alternate names. Enjoy them or don't.    Yo! Da Got Served Star Wars 3: Electric Boogaloo Bantha PooDoo: Forbidden Dance Docking Bay '94 Dude, Where's My Falcon? I See Sand People (The Sith Sense) Amidala Sue Got Married THX 11/38 Gungans Got Back The Smoking Gungan Happiness is a Warm Gungan Gungan Slingers Tails of the Gungan Gungan Tails Star Wars 3: Again with the Gungans Gungan Babies: This Side of Merchandise
