Worship is becoming natural to me, which is awesome.        Now prayer is becoming a major focus in my life. I know prayer is a powerful thing. Hopefully I won't take that lightly. I'm trying to discipline myself in prayer. It's so hard though. I mean I can pray it's just so hard to find time. I guess when i go back to school I'll have to make time.        Speaking of school, I have yet to get those two books read. I'll be reading at the last minute. I'm hoping to be done before I go to San Antonio, because I know I won't get them read out there. So I have 2 weeks.        Oh yeah before I forget, the band has a new name! We're now called, Sea of Glass! How cool is that? It's based on Revelation 15. It's really cool. I, personally, like it. I think everyone in the band does too. I'm beginning to grow on them too. I mean I kind of have to since the drama team is completely falling apart. But hopefully everything will pull together. I'll be praying about it.        Church was really awesome tonight. I thought it went well. I'm really expecting God to do something great. I just have a feeling that lives are gonna be changed. I'm praying that the Holy Spirit just begin to take control of the services.        Bro. Ryan is getting us geared up in evangelism. I'm really gonna try to reach someone this upcoming school year. Liana is really the only person  I  know that is unsaved. I mean I know that there are plenty of other people, but she's the one I know. If I ever see Holly, I'm gonna try to get her to start going to church. It's kind of scary, but then again, it shouldn't be. The worst thing that could possibly happen is, their response be "No".        Anyway I have to do some more blog updating in my other blogs. So yeah... :)
