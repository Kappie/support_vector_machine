I think I had one of those sex and the city moments where Carrie is writing and she writes something unbelievably witty and the camera zooms in on her writing it and she is at the end of the line, then she says something like "On the other side of town Samantha was at the beach with her man, she built an sand castle around him just so she could blow him without anyone noticing" like it's nothing at all, oh Carrie Bradshaw.
