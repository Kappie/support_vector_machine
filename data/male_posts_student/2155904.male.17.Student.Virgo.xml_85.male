School was pretty boring except it was short because of late start schedule meaning that Tyke didn't get that bored.  He went out to lunch in his normal car and he even, with Kinker, employed the Turner Move.  Parking Kinker's car down at the community center so as to assuage the crisis caused by the buses after school.  Then Tyke just drove Tyke to his car after school.  Worked like a charm.  A lucky charm.  With the leprechaun included.  As Tyke just wrote that he went and found a perfect new buddy icon.  Wow, that is so fitting.  He might be the one who finds it most hilarious but oh well, that means something good.  Good times in the Turner head.  Ahhh yes.  Go Tyke.  Well anyway, Physics was really funny again today.  Since 1/2 isn't there the two teachers have had no control over the class really.  So Tyke, Purdy, Kinker, and crew all just talk about stuff (mostly sex stuff today) and it is reaaaal funny.  Even when Tyke got repositioned by the teacher it was funny.  She said something funny to him, like it could have been taken that she was coming on to him or something, but really it was funny.  He also learned some new acts.  Like the jogger or going pole-skiing.  Ya know, just stuff like that.  But no Hot Carls or Cleveland Steemers.  Those are just gross.  Don't even ask.  WAY TOO SICK!  If you do ask what they are, then you are gross yourself and should be stabbed with a dull pen until a minor sore is created in your right armpit.  And then you should be kicked too.  Tyke has made up some odd punishments today.  Like his punishment for when his Word crashed on him.  It was quite random and odd, but fitting as Word did him a great disservice by closing on him.  If he could he would get back at Word.  But by swearing and throwing stuff at it, he would also be hurting other good programs, like Minesweeper and PowerPoint.  There ain't nothing wrong with those babies.  They don't deserve the punishment that Word should be put through.  He would love to give Word mad cow.  That would teach it.  Make it die a long and miserable death and then just go insanely crazy.  Now Tyke feels dirty for he is imagining different ways to murder a computer program that he uses frequently.  No matter.  After school Tyke came home and didn't do anything.  The highlight of his night might have been when he left the house to go to Kinko's and simply because it meant he could listen to his CD some more.  Oh crap, he forgot to make a copy for Dotti.  Sorry...he will do it tomorrow he hopes.  But that is a fun CD.  "If You Want My Body" is one of the greatest songs ever.  So catchy and Amed is in love with that one masculine yet feminine voice on it.  Odd description but very fitting at the same time.  Tyke has been taking a lot of vitamin C lately and that is actually kind of fun.  It gives him an odd rush when he has this one tablet.  Like his mouth kinda tingles and then his body sorta shakes and his sore throat even goes away at that point.  One of those things that can't be explained.  Kinda like this other situation he has been talking about with his mom.  As you all know, or at least should know, Tyke has this heart defect that he really has no idea what caused it or anything like that.  He also has a chest deformity but the doctors don't think that has any correlation to his heart (which is sorta odd but still).  Well Tyke has gone to his cardiologist and run tests and stuff but they haven't detected the problem so he just has to be wary of it.  But anyway Tyke talked to his mom today about how he felt, cold-wise, and he said something about his heart.  Well, immediately his mom started quizzing him about what it was he was feeling cuz now they know that his heart isn't exactly "normal" so they have to be cautious.  Well, it seems as though everything is normal but who knows.  Its not like Tyke is fearful of his heart condition or anything, more of just aware of possibilities and stuff.  And really, it is just a great story to tell if nothing does come of it.  He will be able to tell his grandchildren about how he lived the first 15 years of his life unaware that his heart and chest were abnormal monstrosities.  Of course he will add dramatic flair and take some storyteller's license.  He will be like Homer telling the Iliad and the Odyssey and that kind of jargon.  To go off on another tangent (cuz really that is all this is, tangents and rambles, rambles and tangents) Tyke is a touchy person.  As Haras knows, Tyke likes to receive that unexpected blindsided hug and it really makes his day.  A hug really can show someone you care.  Or it can just show that you are horny.  Sometimes it is hard to differentiate between the two.  Not that Haras was horny when she hugged Tyke.  He isn't saying that.  He's sure she wasn't.  Not that there's anything wrong with being horny.  But she was just being friendly.  Friendly is good.  Eek, bad ending to the blog.  Damn, Thursday sucks.
