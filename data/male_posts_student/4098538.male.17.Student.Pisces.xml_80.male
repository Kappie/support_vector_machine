I don't miss anyone else in the slightest (well, maybe my family). It sounds selfish and possessive but I just want to be around her all the time. I love seeing her arrive and I hate seeing her leave. I'm so glad I have found her! I just know she deserves better and I want her to be blissfully happy...
