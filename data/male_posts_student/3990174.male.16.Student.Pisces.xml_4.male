We actually need to form our own team, find players to enter, and then order jerseys to compete with other teams. We have about 12 teams this time. 6 in each group. A group, which is also m\y team's group, can be counted as the Death Group. Well, we have Ming Chew's(a state player, centre) team, a combination of outside shooters and a great lansi centre. The next team, will be Jing Chung, the super handsome cutter guy in our school. His team is packed with tall people like Guang Beng and Alvin. Then it will be our team, of course it will be me!!! Haih~~~I know I suck, but give me a little bit of face, at least i am the best in my team. hahaha. Another strong team, will be Chun Kee's team. He is the best shooter in CLHS, and his team is strong too. Packed with tall and speedy people. Another good team, will be Hello Kitty!!! Don't get me wrong, there is really this team. Chong Beng, Qiang Yao and Chan Ren are the aces in this team. The last team, which everyone hates, will be the form 6 team. They play cheat, play dirty. Everyone hates them. Now I will post up all the results of the group. Ming Chew's team = Zhen Xing, Jing Chung's team = Mystics, Cody's team = Diablos, Chong Beng's team = Hello Kitty, Chun Kee's team = JKR, nonono, i mean Scavengers, Form 6 team = LA 6ers.
