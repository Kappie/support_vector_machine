I'm going to Jenny J's house next Tuesday with  urlLink Rhedyn .  We're going to have a talk about how we are feeling.  I'm not sure how it's going to work though, as meaningful conversations usually just arise of their own free will.  We shouldn't expect too much to arise I suppose.  Anyway, here's a poem I wrote in English while I was supposed to be writing an essay:  Thoughts and dreams animosity Screams of lucid stare Blue without black harmony Bleeding halls and whispered clouds  We will find the true speech Nor shall you know his true name Without his soul your nature will never be Entranced and innoculated, your essence has crumbled  I don't really like it.
