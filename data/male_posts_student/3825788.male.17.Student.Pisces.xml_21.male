The LAN party was awesome, met some cool guys, watched Initial D, ate 4 McChickens. I also pushed a shopping cart into some guy's car at 12:30 AM, but that's another story for another time. Actually, that's pretty much all there is to the story. We were screwing around, I tried to push a shopping cart into one of the receptacles for shopping carts, it curved, and hit a car. Hard. Luckily, there was no damage to the car.  Fast foreward to later in the week, I don't remember when, Brolin and I are in a pool with Mike and 2 girls. Go on like this for about 6 hours, add a thunderstorm, pissed parents, and girls trying to get me to dance to Sum41. This was my... Thursday?  Friday at 3:00 I took my final driver's ed drive.  Apparently, I am a champion parallel parker.  Today has blown hardcore. Everyone is out of town, or broke their ankle (DAMN YOU LUCAS!). I woke up 11 hours ago, and I'm tired again. boating tomorrow, which means more of me looking like this:     I guess my week hasn't sucked at all.  More pics tomorrow.
