If something is up, I will tell you! ........It seems less caring...asking "what's up" instead of "how are you?"...and we are so lazy we have to cut back on the "what's up?" so now it's just, "sup"....  So if you want to know what is up with me...don't ask...don't worry...be pacient....you just say hey, and then I say hey...then we skip the whole "sup", "nm" crap...and I will tell you if anything new is going on....instead of asking "what's up?"  why don't you ask me how I am doing....  kind of a stupid thing to rant about....well, at least I am starting to rant a little bit more...nothing else to say on that issue....adios...  "Hell, he was even more punk than me." -NOFX
