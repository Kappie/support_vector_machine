We're planning on going tubing but it's rained all night and this morning.  My cousin Brian and his family are going with us.  We're going to leave around 5:00PM.  I have so many things to do and no time to do them.  I'm going crazy!  And since I'm leaving this weekend I am missing a bunch of stuff at church.  I'm kinda worried about the sound room too 'cause the guys that were supposed to do it forgot they were this weekend and were planning on going camping... so they kinda weren't prepared.  I tried to show them as much as I could wednesday night at practice.  I can't wait until someday I'm full time at a church somewhere and my job and school won't get in the way.  Ok, I need to get ready to go to work.  I might write more later or during this weekend.
