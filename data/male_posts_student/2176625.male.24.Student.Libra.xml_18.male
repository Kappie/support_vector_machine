I was not looking forward to coming home until she said "yes" to this:   I feel like I'm back in 7th grade writing a letter like this but when I tried to tell you over the phone what I am about to say when we last talked, you didn't seem interested or you were preoccupied with something else. I don't know if you are aware of this or not, but I like you. There I said it. I'm done hinting around. Now this is what I'm proposing: I am coming home for a visit sooner the I told you, in November, for two days only.  If you are interested, and I hope that you are, I think we should go out. On a date, just us. If you feel uncomfortable about that then bring a friend but I want to go out to dinner with you. I would never want to put you in a position where you would not feel comfortable.   I'm just asking for an hour and a half of your time, nothing more. I don't expect you to kiss me (or anything even beyond a handshake), I know that's not your style, all I want is a piece of your time, not your ass.  No pressure, no hidden agenda. I don't think it is unreasonable or asking too much of you. Now that I've put it out on the line what do you say? You have nothing to loose unless you say no. Then you'll be loosing a free dinner, company with an old friend and something else down the line perhaps. Think about it and get back to me when you're ready.   Derick Ro
