I'm havin' trouble with my previous sn, so this'll haveta do for now. Goddamn AOL bastards.  I'm still dirt sick, but I actually decided to go to like a doctor and I got m'self some meds that  should  work. We'll see. Anyway sorry about leavin' early on Friday, I was all like weak n' disoriented and felt like emptying the contents of my stomach over most of my surroundings.  There's somethin' scary goin' on and each day it seems to get the world darker and darker everyday. Filesharin's becomin' even more like a truly underground thing, and not in the way of a sub-culture, but in the way that freedom-loving information sharers like myself must now live like lowly scum that are chased after everyday for things like murder and contraband.  Every passing day, we get more uncertain, Sharman Networks, owners of KaZaA are constantly being hounded, p2p programs are getting "sitting" programs that sit in the network cutting off file transfers they detect, the RIAA's gettin' more and more aggressive, and corps all over are gettin' together to kill the ones that promote file-sharing, and come up with more and more digital encriptions for both digital information, and software/music sold in stores.  This stirrs quite a bit of a dilemma, and makes you kinda wonder about the future, should we go ahead and fight for our beliefs,  risking possibly our freedom if we get too involved, or let them take away our freedom of speech, and our rights, such as our rights to information. How could we let them restrict the flow of information? How can we let them just bottle us up like this? Maybe we will face a dark future of cyber-hackers and identity stealers, just like in all those cyberpunk films, just 'cause a few greedy execs and artists, and our corporation-fucking goverment couldn't get over their obsession with money. Well I'm not gonna lie down and take this, 'cause I'm all for freedom, and that includes the freedom of information, b/c that's all the 1's and 0's we toss across the net is...a whole lot of information no one should make a claim on. The artists and movie producers who are shared over the internet actually gain more popularity this way, and they still make way more money through concerts, events, and movie showings, so they should shut their assholes up and quit bitchin'. I don't care how bad it gets, I'l fight back anyway I can.  I'm the Zenman, share information! Protect your rights!
