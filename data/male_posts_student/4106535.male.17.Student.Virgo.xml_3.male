I'm working on getting this all photo-documented but it's proven difficult by all kindsa' crazzy circumstances's'~~~111   We (my partner's-in-crime and myself) have acquired an abandoned office building, five-stories high. We simply found it unlocked (chain clipped by some-addicts, hoodlums, homeless, whatever) and put our own locks on it. The 'previous residents' destroyed almost every room of the huge building, glass, holes in walls, and other mess. We, on the other hand, are cleaning it up and moving in furniture we find on the street. Why? The feeling of power every time you see the key to the lock dangle from your key-chain. (The building is humongous, and would be beyond our dreams if it wasn't so thrashed-up!)  Going to Seattle soon so I'm working three days in a row at Homma's    'ts good eatin' if you likes yourself a sushi~
