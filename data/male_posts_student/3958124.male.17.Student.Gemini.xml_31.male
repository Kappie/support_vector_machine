School was wiggidy whack, because I had to write a short story that was piss-poor. Travis gave me a summary of his and if it fought mine in a cage match, mine would have come out with less balls.  So then Friday rolls around. The day I had been waiting for. All week I thought about Friday. True relaxation came. I went to Travis's with Noah and played Halo. Scores were T-25 E-8 N-6 then T-25 E-7 N-7. But really, I wasn't trying. At about five, Jeremy, Farid, and Liz came over and we went out to Anna's Taqoria (sp?). Farid backed his car into a cement wall and dislodged his rear bumper. Fortunately, he had a roll of duct-tape. Jeremy and Farid were going to try and tape that shit on the wrong way. Then I came out of left field all MacGyver style and was like, "No, you don't have enough paper clips. Get me a piece of paper, a tooth pick, and a match, and I'll fix it." They went off to get it, and I just taped it on. They came back and they were all, "Do you still need all this shit?" So we start driving off and Travis and Liz decide to flip the bizzle to these college kids from the way back seat. One of them freaks out and Farid goes all James Bond on us and drives like he's the man. He swerves through cars in the parking lot, T and L screaming "Oh, shizzle my nizzle! That white fellow is gonna catch us! Floor it Jam- Farid!" We made it to Mass ave from the P-lot and as we drove away, we saw that stupid white kid flash us the "Westside" sign. Both hands, actually. I'm surprised he could manage such a complex motor function. He had, after all, just chased a bunch of stupid high school kids for giving him the mid-f. After that, we rolled to the T-Pad and chizzled. Viewed Harold and Maude and cried a little cry. For those who might care, it makes me sad to say that I think Liz hates my guts. I don't know wtf I did, but that's how it looks. It's too bad too. It's another friend that we each could have earned, but I guess not. What ev. Yesterday (Sat 31) suxxored. I did nothing all day. Today was similar, but I read 70 pages of Ethan Frome.  I'm going to go root for the Panthers to piss my dad off. Then, when they score a touch down, I'm going to scream "HOME RUN! GO CATS!" Peace in.
