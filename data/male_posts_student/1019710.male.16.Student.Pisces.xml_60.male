I sit down, don't really say anything and Alex decideds it would be funny if we got a black guy that could literally annihilate me, but I thought he really wasn't gonna act on it, that was until John Kincaid opened his mouth.   John: Hey Jeremy come over here"  Jeremy (black guy):what up  Neal: This kid (pointing at me) was talking trash about you  Jeremy: WHAT?  Daniel: Oh S#!T  Jeremy: What did he say?  Daniel: I didn't say anything, I don't even know you.    We go back and fourth trying to decide if i said anyting, until Adam Kincaid opens his mouth   Adam: He called you a N@#$%R!  Jeremy: You called me what?  Daniel: I swear I didn't  Jeremy: Hey Corey come over here   This is where I actually get a break, I have known Corey since I was in 9th and I wrote and article about him this year   Corey: Nah I know Daniel he wouldn't say that.   Daniel: Thank you Jesus  So after that I go into the lunch line and look over and see this Jeremy guy make a cut throat sign to me, which yet again made me think I was going to die. But I was pretty sure he was kidding with me.
