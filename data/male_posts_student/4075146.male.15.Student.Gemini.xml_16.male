So I got to rewrite those parts of the paper today, after FINALLY finishing Chidamber (or so I think...). WMC was fixed--like many other pressing (and annoyingly irrational) problems I've had while programming this, the issue was again one line of code that was either misplaced, or I forgot to take out, or something. I end up spending a lot more time on those than I have to...lol...Also, since I changed the WMC implementation, I reimplemented the method count. Although, I still can't seem to find a good way to figure out if a method is synthetic...while that's really only a minor issue, it has to be fixed at some point...the last hour or so has just been adding to the "metrics" section of my report's methodology.  Pasha + Dr. Memon, are there any journals that I should try to submit my paper to, when I have some viable results?  arXiv  is a free journal that accepts most submissions; a good majority of the astrophysics journals I've read have been off of arXiv, but I'm not sure how its standing in the CS world is...Pasha, maybe we can discuss that tomorrow? Or maybe I shouldn't be getting so far ahead of myself....lol
