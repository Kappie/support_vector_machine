She told me that she missed me, but wouldnt beleive me when I told her it back. As I type this, I know that she is the only one  ever  going to read this, but.... I MEANT IT. Hell, I stare at her picture at least twice a day. TUESDAY. Thats the day shes coming back. Thats the day shes going to call me, right? I'm pretty happy with myself. I'm not as much of a stalker as I thought. I mean, I onlythink about her 7 or 8 times. Let me finish. 7 or 8 times----per minute.
