The reliable  Soyuz , currently the only means of transport to the International Space Station, may send tourists on a  voyage around the moon  ( gallery of illustrations ).  Constellation Services International 's plans call for the Soyuz spacecraft to dock with a logistics module and an upper stage. The upper stage fires to send the Soyuz on a free-return circumlunar trajectory."   Space tourism is becoming more and more feasible, now...as an avid astronomer/budding astrophysicist, I can't help but feel jealous but seeing members of N*Sync in space before me and the thousands of others who care a bit more about this kind of stuff, but I guess that's just my arrogance showing through...at least we're not bothering with sending astronomers there. It would be nice to return to the moon, but we have bigger priorities right now--manned missions to Mars, and just  what  happened to those probes to Europa and Pluto/Kuiper Belt? Those two missions are much more exciting and should be a much higher priority, IMO, then sending a bunch of millionaires to the moon, most of whom are just going there because they can, not out of actual interest. Although I guess that's a bit harsh on Dennis Tito, etc...
