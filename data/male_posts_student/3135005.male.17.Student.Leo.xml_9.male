Never happened to me before... most people here say that there limit is 2 years below them, but none of them said a word when i said what grade she is in... i thought is was a weird sign... that odd moment of silence, but then they said that people do go out with people in that grade. one girl who heard kinda gave me a depressive sigh, which later on i found out she had liked me... but i already like this other girl. Can't really help it if i like someone else, but i kinda feel bad to let someone down...  I hope that something works out with me and the girl of this blog's topic. I've been told some discouraging things from Tiger(thx for the vote of confedence). I try not to believe the things he says but fuck, what if they are true. And if Mushu(if u didn't read my other blog you wont understand) figures out what im talking about, OH FUCKING WELL! i do not care if he knows, and i really don't think he cares either, if he does, well what can i do, cry me a fuckin river, life goes on. I wanna get to know her and talk to her, but i got to wait for that sign, the slight sign that a guy looks for in a girl he likes and hopes it might possibly reflect back off of her and come back to him. She is gorgeous, has a sense of humor, and a beautiful smile. I'm just hoping i can get to know her more...
