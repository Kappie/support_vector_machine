They just rerun some movies selected from a pool of movies that have previously runned, mostly from the spring semester.   This is from one of  The American Pie  sequels (I am not sure which one this is from)  It was fun for me but it might be a stupid way of making fun for others. My recollection brings back a rough story below.     A daughter and her boyfriend were having an affair in her room. Her mom asked her dad to go up and get the two down for supper. Dad went up. The moment dad was about to say something, he heard her daughter. She was like "I'm coming!" So dad got back downstairs without asking them to come down.     You are supposed to laugh outloud at this point.
