I got to first period and i found out that i was one point short of exempting my exam for english. That sucks a big one. after that i went to my math class (which is boredom sent from Dante's Inferno)and had to put up with a bitch of a substitute, not to mention her incompetence. I got out of school a little after 3rd period (because i dont have anymore exams that day) and went by Laura's house to drop off a cd i burned for her but she didnt answer the door either because she wasnt there or didnt hear me knock. After that i drove my butt back over to my dads house and ate lunch and then drove over to my moms house to write all this in my blogg. Well i dont really have any plans for the rest of the day other than to pick up my sister and her friends from school. My dad is and ok guy, well until he married my stepmom. She has this fake niceness about her and she has convinced my dad that they need to be MORE HOLY. i have already expressed my views of spirituality, if you set out to try and look good and try to APPEAR holy ur nothing but a hipocrit and do things for external rewards(in other words ur a total fake) anywho i guess i can put up with her for a night or so. well until another time my friends
