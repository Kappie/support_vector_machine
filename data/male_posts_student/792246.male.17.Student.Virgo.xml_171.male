Since I had so much time to not pay attention and think about other things during the movie(more on that later), I spent a lot of time planning how to review this. In the end, I've decided to review this third part in the trilogy, like a trilogy in itself. I call the parts of this trilogy, "The Beginning", "The Middle", and "The End".  So, let's start at the beginning.   The Beginning  The movie starts right where the second one left off, so in theory you'd need to see that one first. However since very little that happened in that movie is of any importance whatsoever, and all you need to understand this movie is about the first 5 minutes of the second movie, that theory seems to be wrong.  Right away I noticed something was different here. That difference was that the flow of the plot was broken up by awkward scene changes, the result of what I imagined to be the brainchild of some alien life found growing in the Wachowski Brothers collective shit.  I soon realized what was really happening though. Our directors had decided to suddenly emulate  a C-quality Hong Kong movie emulating a B-quality Hong Kong movie emulating a B-quality American film noir movie which is in turn emulating a movie, which by something my dictionary calls irony, may have in fact been good.  The interesting highlights of this part of the movie include gay men in a bar so sexual that it could only be European, a good shot of that French woman's voluptuous cleavage, and a new character that looks like he was handpicked from the bums of Palo Alto.(Alternatively, this man could be Gabe Lutge in aging makeup.)  This part of the movie is about the same quality as the prior movie, and if it stayed that way, this movie wouldn't have caused the man in front of me to fall comotose and begin snoring for the next hour and a half.  On a sidenote, Keanu Reeve's acting is bad. No...REALLY bad. I have never seen this man act so bad. This should say something. I mean, it really SHOULD say something.  My favorite part of this part of the movie is that it has no significance and fails to either provide character development, plot progression, or any hint in the viewer's mind of the disaster that follows.   The Middle   I can't tell you much about this movie. I can tell you it sucked. I can also tell you the basic summary of what happened. However if anything more minor than that, such as a major character dying or somesuch, I would not be able to tell you. Why?  I was pretty much asleep.  You see, for those of you not in the know, the machines are digging into Zion. From the beginning of the movie we are given 12 hours before they reach the core. The Wachowski brothers have decided to show the fear and terror of this event by showing it to us in real-time. Now, by real-time I don't mean 12 actual hours in the theatre. I mean an hour that feels like 12+ hours. None of the characters anyone actually cares about are in this scene, and that's what the middle of the movie really is, a scene. Instead we are given people we don't care about, a setting that makes me vomit everytime I see it, and a whole lot of boredom. I have never been so tempted to walk out of a movie in my life.  Now, it may sound like I'm saying this is a bad thing. On the contrary, while I was not so lucky to have read this review before seeing the movie, you my friend are. And I say this: bring something to do. Here is a short list of things to do during this hour.  1. Sleep. Especially good for insomniacs who Nyquil hasn't worked for. This segment has the ability to let you feel like Helen Keller trapped in a movie theatre watching every Star Trek movie in one sitting. Hot stuff.  2. Work. Granted it's dark, so bring a light. The audience won't care, they're all asleep.  3. Sex. The background noise consists of little more than an occasionaly explosion, which is pretty hot stuff. And the glare from the screen is consistently dull and boring, so no surprises there. I suggest group sex, as more people than just you will be looking for things to do.  4. Listen to a CD player. Or, perhaps a tape player and some books on tape. If you're looking for something more exciting than the movie, anything with as much action as "The Scarlet Letter" should be fine.  5. Watch the first Matrix on DVD on your laptop. If feeling particularly adventurous, one could sync it up so that exciting parts happen at the same time on both screens. Of course, this could prove challenging for some pretty obvious reasons.   The Ending    If you're still awake by the time the ending comes around, be sure to watch it. It's easily better than the rest of the movie put together, with a very clever conclusion. One is left to think that if the rest of the movie had been as clever and well down as those five minutes, then maybe you wouldn't have had to bring a pillow.  To summarize this movie, I will give you one statement that kept flashing through my head throught the motionless picture.   I have never gone to a movie with such low expectations, and still been so dissapointed.   I mean it folks. This is bad stuff. Please keep clear of it, and don't let your children see it. And if anyone enjoyed it, for the good of mankind get a catscan now. Or maybe a lobotomy.
