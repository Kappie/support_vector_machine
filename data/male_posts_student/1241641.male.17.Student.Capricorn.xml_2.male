The ad put heat on president Clinton for not fighting terrorists, even after the first bombing of the World Trade Center and the attack on the USS Cole.  Thirty-eight days after Clinton took office the World Trade Center was attacked (and did anyone blame Bush?).  President Clinton captured, tried, convicted, and imprisoned those responsible.  So thankfully, we did not see any attacks on the Pope, twelve jetliners in the U.S., UN headquarters, the FBI building, the Israeli embassy in the U.S., the U.S. embassy in Albania, the LA airport, the Boston airport, the Lincoln tunnel, the Holland tunnel, and the George Washington Bridge.  Clinton tripled the FBI budget for counterterrorism and doubled funding for fighting terrorism overall.  He created a top-level national security post to coordinate all federal counterterrorism activity.  Clinton struck targets in Sudan and Afghanistan in retaliation for attacks against U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.  Newt Gingrich said the president "did exactly the right thing."  Clinton also launched a presidential directive authorizing the assassination of Osama bin Laden.  After the attacks on the USS Cole, president Clinton directed Richard Clarke, the first national antiterrorism coordinator, to create a plan to take out Al Qaeda.  The plan would break up Al Qaeda cells and arrest those involved, attack the financial support for the group, and would increase actions in Afghanistan to destroy terrorist training camps and capture or kill Osama bin Laden.  The plan was finished right before Bush took office.  So instead of handing Bush a war, they decided to let him implement the plan himself.  But he didn't.  So that is where Clinton stands.  The plan sat around in the Bush administration until finally, eleven months after Clinton told Clarke to create it, Bush was advised to phase it in.  This was in early September, 2001.  And speaking of Clinton, it appears that it isn't just the democrats that have no values.  Yes, our culture of moral decadence has spread on to family value conservatives such as Illinois republican Jack Ryan, currently seeking a seat in the U.S. Senate.  For those of you not covering the news, his ex-wife, actress Jeri Ryan, claimed he pressured her to have sex with him at swingers clubs in front of other people.  To Ryan's credit, at least it was his lawfully wedded wife.  Kudos!
