What does EMO really mean? so i started some intensive research, My first stop was Google. Nothing there except everything i didnt want to see about EMO. It claims that emo is extensivly just emo punk. This were i have to disagree, this is my purpose! EMO is a shortened term for the word emotional. Who the hell invented the word EMO for it to mean emo punk. wouldnt it its shortened term be like; EMUNK, PMO, EMK and the list goes on! I think people dont understand the meaning of EMO beacuse its actually everywhere, this piece of writting is EMO because it has emotion. This is what im trying to say, in everything there is emotion, which means all music is emo, which also means people use the wrong freaking word to describe one perticular type of music (emo punk). Bands like Tool and iron maiden are as emo as any other band beacuse they express emotion. No longer bands like simple plan and Good charlotte can simply be called EMO. All music is EMO, can you think of a song that doesnt express emotion? Even techno (my most feared music) express emotion. Jakes Gangster rap, express emotion! All music has emotion. You cant call one style simple just EMO.
