I choose Frosty because the other two live and have organs such as a penis or vagina for those who believe Rudolph and the "Easter Bunny" exist. So Matt came home on the bus and Paul Matt and I all went to see our middle school teachers. Unfortunetly I NEVER SAW IURKA!  But I did meet fucking DOLAN! And in a bad way... you see we were all looking around not knowing you needed to call the school for permission before you came. We met three cool girls and hung out with them for a while and some security guard yelled at us for being in the school. So Dolan met up with us, I said I was Jake, of course being the one who lies, Matt and Paul told the truth. Mrs. Stoltz came to pick us up pretending I was Jake and that she didn't know me. I wish he was dead... seriously he is such a retard. He actually said "What if the roof caved in?" Matt replied in his head... "What if it didn't you fucker." That guy is the biggest orthodox homo. He makes the biggest fuss over the stupidest things that have no purpose in repremanding over. Ok, now I'm going to the movies "MATRIX RELOADED" with Matt. BUT OF COURSE WE NEVER FUCKING SAW IT, WE GOT THE GOD DAM TICKETS BUT LITTLE GOTH GIRL WOULDNT LET US IN. This country blows "nuggets" - Nick C... seriously, what the fuck, this country needs more free rights. Like kids are allowed to see a rated R movie if they have the ticket. Ok, so we saw Paul, Steve, James and Chad. Me and Matt got picked up at Sports Plus and with our remaining money, Matt bought LP Meteora and I gave my money to James for his birthday. Matt crossed 347 and almost got smooshed. I crossed the smart way, not at the intersection. When we got home, we watched all movies possible, then shot a few gangstaZ. End.
