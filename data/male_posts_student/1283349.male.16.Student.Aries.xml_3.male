People like stuff, right?  Anyhoo, I just played some b-ball (the real kind) over at the middle school near mah house. It was me, my pop (I don't really call him that. It's just too quaint to resist), my best friend Alexander, and his pop. Another team (of sorts) was playing on another court, and after about 3 games, they asked us to play. They were from...oh, 20 to their late thirties, four guys. So, we just kept our teams the way we were and picked up the thrown down metaphorical gauntlet. The game (slaughter) that ensued made me realize the difference between playing every few months and every week. Maybe I'll try to do that more...I enjoy it when people aren't screaming, "YER DEAD MILLER!" (They weren't at the time. They may have after I left, though I doubt it.)  Tonight I'm off to play some Deeyundee over at Brian's place. Clark'll be running the game, and since he usually DMs a Hack-Worthy game, this should be fun. Hopefully Aerios can show off his superb Preaching and Being Holier Than Thou skills. He's got 30 fuckin ranks in each, baby.  -Dice Squirrel 30 Fuckin Ranks in Squirreling (Dice)
