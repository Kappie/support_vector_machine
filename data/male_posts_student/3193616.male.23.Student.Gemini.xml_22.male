The only way it had been going is down and there is nothing to suggest that it would change in the near(far) future. By far the signals that are coming are proving the other way. The analysis done by the Rakesh Mohan COmmittee was good and I think they have zeroed on the exact cause for the sorry state of Indian Railways. It confuses the twn identity it has and has not been able to come out of this state. The subsequent ministers who were there treated Railways as their feifdom and that tradition of ours is still continuing. Hope that will end soon.
