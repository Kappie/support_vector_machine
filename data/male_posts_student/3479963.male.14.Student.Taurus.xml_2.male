We had to design a vanity mirror of our own. It was such a mess~!! I hate DNT. I think it is just one of the extra subjects that isn't important. It means nothing spending hours curving out shapes~~ Omg~~ It was last minute till then my group remembered that we still had a science project to do. Hmm... plan= Friends come to my house to do the project and later i hurry off to my barbeque?? YUpz.. sounds good!!~~   THe barbeque was indeed a messy and boring one, i just reached home like about 1/2 hour ago?? Yupzx~ hmm...its rather late for a 14 yrs old boy ya know. However my lastest was 1.30am. I went out with my friends to watch a soccer match. Well that was a excuse, my other friend, she invited me to her house, sad, i wasn't the only one to go.    =( haha.... jkjk.... Yawnz im tired... mY panda eyes coming out le...lol I am still feeling depressed, when will this feeling be gone?? Maybe I should do some soul searching.
