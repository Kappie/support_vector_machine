All I'm thinking at this point is ventricles, midbrain, pons, medulla, cranial nerves, lesions, and so forth.    I went to see my new place today, and omg, it is huge!!  We have an insane view over the Four Season's resort and golf club.  And it's in an incredibly rich neighbourhood which is a very good thing around here.  I'd even care to venture that my new place is bigger than Nitin's house!!  And by December, we'll have a swimming pool!!  Hahaha!  JL, you're coming ok?  Good :)  38 days and counting...and block exams on Friday, ack!!  Ok, time for bed...zzzzzzzz.
