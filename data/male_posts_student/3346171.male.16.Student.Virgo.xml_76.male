But i was needing it. I woke up  so    well ,  i was feeling   fresh ,  new ,  clean ,  young ,  etc .   At night me, dad, sis, mom and niece when to the mall. Mom wanted to buy something to wear under the jacket or whatever that thing is named. And "we" found some friends and  they  stayed talking, about stuff.  While they were cathing up, I stayed thinking about  COWS!!!!!  Why? I don't know. I just did. I don't even like cows, they make those noises and are wierd.   Ew ew ew  ! I hate cows.  And when we were leaving, i asked dad for a milk- shake and i ordered a  large  order.   YUMMY!   I deserved, i've been a good son!!!!!! hahahahahah.... Who am i tring to cheat on?!!!!!!  Tomorrow is the "the" day, me and dad are going to the language course, i'll study   italian . I  had to take 30 reais from my savings. I hate taking money off of it but if i hadn't i guess my father wouldn't pay the other   141,00 reais.
