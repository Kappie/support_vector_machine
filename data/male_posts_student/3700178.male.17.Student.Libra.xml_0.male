One thing I've learned in my experiences with drug people and drug culture we cant be convinced or tricked even its a realization we come to alone or not at all.  I'll go to rehab but when i get out it'll still be there.  Unless i wanted to go there its not going to do anything for me.  "i just cant handle the fact of thinking that someone else is somehow controlling any part of my life in any way" "you cant even do it for me" "no darling im sorry i cant let someone else reign over my destiny" I have always had a problem with controling people and as a consequence i have had quite a problem with authority figures in my life.  Held up and oppressed by their fascist rules.  My step-father the worst offender.  It turned my life into a vicious cycle of being turned out on doorsteps.  I would think oh itll be better at this place and find myself not even being able to handle the most miniscule of rules.  Then it would start all over again with me testing the waters at my newest place.  I finally realized i needed a solution to this problem when i lived with my uncle for around six months funny finding clarity where the murky water originated.  His parting words of wisdom dont turn your mind into shit.  I spent my first week in an orgy of marijuana mixed with any other drug i could possibly find.  Then i decided it was time for my solution get my own place and live life by my terms.  I went to the medicine cabinet and popped four aderall its an attention defecit disorder medicine when taken in bigger doses it gives a rush like speed.  No where near as pure and long lasting but still enough to clarify my mind.  Now that my mind was clear and not bogged down from its usual concotion of alcohol and marijuana i decided now was the best time to put in job applications.  I went down to a local pizza place sort of like chucky cheese.  I walked in smoothly and unhindered my limbs so full of life they felt like they were floating.  I walked to the register along the left side wall and asked nicely for an application, yes total control i had total control over everything in this situation.  I knew exactly everything i was doing, filling it out was a breeze and later i went over to the taco bell better chances with multiple applications.  Taco bell was more of a last resort i had worked there before and bitterly hated it at that.  Survival was more important than my pride.           work in progress...
