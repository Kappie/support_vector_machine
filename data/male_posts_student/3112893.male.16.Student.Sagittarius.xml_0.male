Here's the summary:  * Went back to IKEA - Bought proper desk and built it  * Went to work at LONI - Went to meeting and talked to the point of embarrassment >_  * Tried to figure out how to go to the Offspring concert on Sunday with my cousin - Half-Failed :-( Not quite though :-D... :- * Found out that I weigh 147 pounds - I'm ~5'9"  * Volunteered at Hospital - No, Jessica wasn't there :-( (4/16)  * More math as usual  So yeah... life's boring. It'd be less boring if something went REALLY wrong. Well, come to think of it, it'd probably be more interesting if something went REALLY right (like me getting into MIT or Jessica dumping whoever she's going out with for my non-jewish ass). I'd probably walk around for a few weeks confused regarding what I did to make it all work. Anyway, it's not as bad as I make it out to be. I just work a lot and go for the unattainable but from what I hear, it builds character and mylinates axons. That alone is sexy enough a reason for me to keep workin'.         -- Fea'
