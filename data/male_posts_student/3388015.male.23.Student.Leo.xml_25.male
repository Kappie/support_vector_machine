I went to Emily's apartment to see if her old computer was good enough to buy for my sister for college, who is attending this fall.  It's pretty good, except the hard drive I brought to put into the machine needed to be formatted, and it took 10 minutes to get to 1%.  So I moved it to the external case and tried again and it was 10 minutes and it hit 1%.  Poor Emily had to sit through all my jokes.  After Emily, I headed back to campus to help Cindy move to Burton.  Chris Sinclair was already helping her move and they moved more than half the stuff already.  So I helped move a couple things and Cindy got zapped by the tv when she was unhooking it.  Then we went out to dinner at Taco Bell.  We've eaten there like 4 times this week.  I think I'm done with tacos for awhile.  I don't think Chris Sinclair liked my jokes too much, he didn't seem to laugh much.  He dropped us off at campus and Cindy and I moved more stuff and set her room a little.  Laura and Luke called and we made plans to visit them.  We went to WalMart to finally pick up the pictures and the guy behind the counter had no idea what was going on.  He was from another department, so every answer to our question was "Yeah, sure.  I think.  Yeah."  I think we could have asked him anything and we would have gotten the same answer.  The cashier we checked out with was amazed that I was happy.  Cashier 'Harlet': Well, you're in a good mood tonight! Luke: I'm always in a good mood. Cindy: He's got this metobolic disorder that keeps him happy all the time.  We looked through all the pictures and a couple of them were pretty good! I'll post one later.  We headed up North to Laura and Luke's and hung out with them for awhile.  We of course stayed too late.  I'm actually still here.  Haha.   Quote:  "Gah!  You can't quote anyone right.  This is our world (she gestures in a circular motion in the air)... and this is YOUR world (motions in another spot in the air)!" - Cindy, explaining how I can't quote anyone right.
