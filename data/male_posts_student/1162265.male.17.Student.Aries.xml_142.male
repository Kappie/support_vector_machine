I was so sad when the people who owned bush cut most of it's branches off and it was leafless, now the leaves have finally all grown back, and the leaf I see has something wrong with one half of it.  Why?  Why does life have to be like that?  Is it part of some divine plan to make some things painfully imperfect?
