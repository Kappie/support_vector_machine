First of all I woke up late, my parents got pissed at me, i nearly missed my bus, I hit my funny bone in Math class, And i nearly got hit by a car in the parking lot o.O  To make it worst i think i might have blew my chance to get to know this girl i like. Her name is Ellie, short for Ellizabeth. Now I'll describe Ellie, for my trusty readers. She is beautiful. She has a great body, smart, funny, nice, and very friendly. But the thing i love most about her is her butt. Now for the male readers I'll to describe it. But sadly i cant describe it. Its one of those things you have to see to believe xD  Anyways, back to the story. Now it was afterschool and i saw Ellie, and as always she look great. So she was talking to one of her friends and she came up to me. But the question was for her other friend about some assignment. While i was there, i started talking to her and i found out that we both hate the same teacher. So me and her walked to the bus stop and i asked her where she is going after school, she said that she's going to starbucks and afterwards to eat some sushi with 2 of her other friends. She made a comment that she's only tagging along with the other girls. She asked me if i wanted to come. At that moment i was so fucking happy. BUT i had a big assignment due tomorrow and i had to finish it. So i declined, FUCK!!!! im so pissed off right now. If i dont get another chance with her Im gonna cry.......fuck this day sucks
