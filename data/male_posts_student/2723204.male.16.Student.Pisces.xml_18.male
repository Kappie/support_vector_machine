Ok.........i'm listening to Andy Lau's Bing Yu now........not a bad song.......imo. But yeah, ok, i'll get into my topic for today now. The topic is..........   There is always a logical, coherent counter-argument to every argument     This is basically what i call a thinking cycle. This is a process by which all human intelligence thrives, once this cycle ends, once an argument is supposedly unchallenged. That is when human intelligence cease to exist. Well, if you still belong in your pathetic little world, and think that "well, what's the point of thinking so much, i'll just lead a happy life, and just be happy.............." Well, let me tell you this, this computer you're looking at now, is a product of someone questioning the laws of physics, this society you live in is a product of someone questioning an argument in sociology, the medicine you take when you are sick is a product of someone questioning the laws of biology.  Everything which you experience and enjoy now, is a product of someone thought patterns and you, are just enjoying the fruits of that. The mind is like a machine, it needs fuel to survive. But that's the problem with our society today. That's the problem with the education system, in almost every part of the world.  But true, the mind needs fuel to survive, but how is the fuel produced is what matters. Say, you've got 15 Joules worth of energy worth of fuel, but will it produce 15 joules worth of work? That's the problem, it means that the brain is simply maintaining itself, without being entirely effective. What does the afore-mentioned illustration signify? It signifies the feeding of knowledge to the human mind. That's basically the study of existing facts, and the mastery of it. In chemistry, I want you to study the topic on covalent and ionic bondings. But i do not expect you to question this particular "fact" and instead accept it as universal and undisputed. And, questioning is non-existent.  But, the right model for the human mind, and the human mind in which is was basically designed for. Is for 15 joules of energy being fed into the brain and 150 joules of work gets done. This is a process of a starting fuel, being processed by the brain to be made into something more productive. And what is this refining process called? This process in which knowledge is multiplied? It is called questioning. Which is why, i strongly encourage the learning of arts (social sciences, philosophy) and the like, because it encourages questioning instead of just learning the hard facts.   That's basically it, i'm gonna sleep soon..............so bye............i'll debunk absolutism on my next post........so good night.......
