Things have been dull outside of school...and in school for that matter.  I talk to all my people and go to classes and things go on as usual.  BUT!!!!  We found a bassist for "GONE ASTRAY"!  Some guy named Jake....ok, I don't know his last name, and I haven't talked to him yet...but he's been playing bass for five years and sounds good enough to be in.   Maybe I can do something this weekend to liven things up and make things more exciting for all the blog readers...since you have such scandalous fun reading of my fun.  I kinda suck...I have a poster thingy due in english on Friday and haven't started it...but it's a drawing thing, so that'll be pretty easy; I also haven't written anymore on my book!!  It nags at me everyday and I somehow come up with something else to do that is obviously superior in prioritative (that's a word now, if it wasn't a minute ago) rank in my little bubble of procrastination.   I have to go get ready for bed...after I write in my little computer journal thingy (yeah I keep a journal...cuz I'm a fag) OOOH!  Aren't you so hurt and afraid that I have secret files on my personal life that you can't lay eyes on!   That's all...go spray paint yourselves blue and streak down the hallways whilst pretending you're on hallucinogens.
