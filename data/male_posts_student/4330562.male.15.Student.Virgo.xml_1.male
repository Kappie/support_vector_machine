IF  If I was one of the First Class Jobs, I would do this for you. If I were one of the Knights of the Round Table, I would be your White Knight and rise whenever you are in danger. If I were the Holiest Priest, I would heal and bless whenever you need me. If I were the Wisest Wizard, I would always get you out of trouble. If I were the Assassin of Assassin, I would gracefully swing my katar for you. If I were the Greatest Hunter, I would hunt anything you want. If I were the World Famous Blacksmith, I would forge the strongest weapon for you.  If I was one of the Second Class Jobs, I would do this for you, If I were the Mightiest Crusader, I would devote my life to you. If I were the Stealthiest Rogue, I would silently take down those who harm you. If I were a Romantic Bard, I would write a lovely song for you everyday. If I were a Creative Alchemist, I would create something special for you. If I were a Powerful Monk, I would create a powerful skill and name it after you. If I were a Knowledgeable Sage, I would find an eternal youth potion for you.  If only you had given me a chance, I would prove to you. If only you cared for me, I would care back more for you. If only you had loved me, I would love you for now and always.  It's not that perfect of a poem but that's was i really can think of and i already summited for the competition.But what the heck ? i got nothing to lose if i send it.And so i did.
