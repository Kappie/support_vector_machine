I bid thee mortals a good day, and ask you kindly to play fair and not bombard my computer or url with any crude or virtually fatal thoughts. I don't know how it is done, but I know it can be done. Somehow. It might take several millenia to reach that point where I do know how it is done, but some day I shall access that supreme power.  My generally and currently empty mind is suffering from the strain of the blog and the html code and the computer that attempted to murder me and mutilate my body. I thank Alanna for kindly using her precious minutes to assist me in escaping hell in a handbag with my blog and my sanity intact. (Okay, the last item may have broken a few years ago, but who gives a damn?) You must go to the site she is the goddess and the janitor of.   urlLink DOY . Go there now puny human or I will track you down and smite you. It is a site that twenty poets and writers and artists post on and Alanna herself is a genius at the English language. I post my own work there sometimes.  I also have a patron goddess. That kind of thing has not been popular since the ancient Greek days but, hey, it could be the next fad. My patron goddess is the lovely Elise, and she has wings of mercury (quicksilver to the ignorant masses) and she has the ability to call upon divine force and smite you. In fact, she could probably get her divine friend Brandon to smite you too (he rules Canada currently but there are some believers in North United States and down here in Memphis Tennessee). Go to her site:  urlLink elise's site  or I will call her to smite you now. She writes poetry and novels and short stories and she is an angel genius. Go to her site now.  For your convenience, there are two little links at the bottom of this blog that will take you there immediately.  On a lighter note, I will be posting my poetry and/or compositions on this blog as well as on Alanna's site. In addition, the readers of this blog will have the pleasure of wading through the confused and sometimes poisonous swamp of my thoughts and emotions. Warning: The emotions and ideas floating around this site are the fatal and sometimes angsty feelings of a teenage boy who has the power to drive (but no car to exercise that in). Do not blame me if you soak up the thoughts like a plant and get many of the same ideas as I do. These thoughts will often be sad or deal with isolation and loneliness and this little thing I like to call insanity.  Just to reassure you: I am not suffering from insanity. I enjoy every minute of it.  Yes I speak to the outcasts and the pariahs and the isolated people of society: I am one of you. Cheers, my fellow human beings.
