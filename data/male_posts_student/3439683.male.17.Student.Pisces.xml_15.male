Aside from that, I'm sure you're anxious to hear about the forensic science camp. I really enjoyed it, the people were cool, it was pretty fun. It was actually challenging (imagine that...something actually stretched my brain). I only wore my wallflower suit for the first hour or two, but I was right about the depression. I got very depressed. See, that has to do with the fact that there were two girls that I liked...I'm sure you can fill in the blanks. I won't mention any names anyway because I know that one of them is probably going to read this. Found out that one of the girls there liked me, she told me last night on AIM. Found it flattering, but I'm just not interested. I mean, she'll probably end up as one of my friends, but no more than that. why is it that the girls I like are never interested in me? Lol. Well, check that...there is, or maybe was, an exception....Sarah...yeah, she liked me, I liked her, but she lives too far away. I still like her, don't know how she thinks anymore. Oh well. I'm feeling pretty good tonight, actually. hey, there's this annoying...damnit, stop! this stupid popup...that's the fifth time in a few seconds. It appears to be gone now, I suppose I continue. Based on Chrisanne's premonition and Stephani's agreement, I'm gonna try again with Sarah A. (different person from aforementioned Sarah). maybe she'll say yes this time. hey, whaddaya know, lost my train of thought...hey, found it floatin' around me 'ead... I wish i could talk to Jessica....she's probably pretty upset right now, lost a friend to AIDS. I'm tired, I'm getting off.
