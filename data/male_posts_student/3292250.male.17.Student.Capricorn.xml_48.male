Because it's summer and because it was too long last time, I wanted it short, but still able to style it and not look like I'm going to Boot Camp. She did a good job, yet again, and I like it. I've always liked my hair shorter. It's so soft and easy to manage. I can wake up and apply hair products as needed for the look I want. And as I went around the house today, I noticed that I look alarmingly cute with shorter hair. Even more so with that faux earring thing I've become too attached to. But enough of my talking about myself for one 15 minute block.
