However, I was feeling most pleased with how the day was going until Mother pranced in after a short conversation with Andrew on the phone. Now despite me not having seen Harry for a month, the little tiger bless him has been complaining to his school teacher that I have been hitting him in the last few days, which brought a whale of tear drenched emotion from Mothers eyes for near on 45 minutes. Why 45 minutes you say; well because everytime we delve into some heated exchange of "words", everything seems to go pearshaped and digress into other areas of my life, one's which should have been (in her mind) put to bed. She often suggests the notion that I should see a counselor, and if not that a psychiatrist, and if not that a psychologist, and if not that, well heavens above, Father *sarcastic gulp*.  Well with my daily ranting over, it's been a good day to be honest, met a swell guy called Wayne who was Amy's friend and had a childish/fun day in Kingston, and tomorrow I travel to see the German, and I think I might ask her out now or once she's single. I don't mean by any stretch of the imagination, to sound cocky or arrogant, but I think for sure she'd say yes considering I know her really well these days; and 3 quarters of the time I can complete her sentences. Well wooopdedoo I'll digress my life to you all later on . . . xBuBzx
