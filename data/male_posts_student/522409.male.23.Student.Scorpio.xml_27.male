I was accused of trying to shoplift (oh yeah... me... really.)  I'm not going to go into that one, but believe me, there will be a strongly worded letter to the kind folks at Strawberries in Downtown Crossing.  And after that, I went to Borders (yes, I'm weak) and bought yet another book.  Yeah.  I know.  Stop me.  But this was excused, and let me tell you why.    So there's this Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer named Edmund Morris who wrote "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" (which is the book he won the Pulitzer for), and the new installation, "Theodore Rex," which I bought the other day.  So he's legit, right?  Right.  Turns out he also wrote a biography of Ronald Reagan.  ::gasp::  He... he.. what???  So this biography, "Dutch," was on sale at Borders for 7 bucks.  How can I, who loves these things so much, and even more, idolizes Reagan, not buy "Dutch" by Edmund Morris for 7 dollars?  Sayin'.  So then I went to the register, and while the young gentleman behind the register handed me my book, he said "Help stop the war in Iraq.  Have a nice day."  Excuuuuuuuse me????  Did you just spew your political thoughts from behind the counter of your employer's building?  I don't care what your politics are, that's unacceptable on every level.  And he said it in that obnoxiously smug tone that's come to characterize the self-declared intellectual liberal college movement, which made me almost reach across the counter.  But I didn't, because it took me about 2 seconds to register what he'd just said.  And I'd already started turning away.  But what the FUCK?!  You can't do that.  I'd like to think that he was saying it to everyone who bought a book from him yesterday, but I have this suspicion that he said it to me because I was buying a book about a conservative.  Either way, his manager will hear about it.  If the sides were switched and I, from behind the counter, noted his longish curly hair and he happened to hand me a copy of  The Nation , and as I handed it back, I said, "Help stop the hippification of America" or "Woodstock was 30 years ago, have a nice day," you can rest assured I'd hear about it in no uncertain terms.  As well it should be.  There are places your politics are irrelevant and inappropriate.  Your place of employment, especially if you're in a service or retail industry, is one of those places.    So I'm almost done reading "Whe Character Was King," Peggy Noonan's biography of Reagan, which will be followed by "Theodore Rex," and then either "Dutch" or "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt."  Haven't figure it out yet.    That's all for now.  Time to shower and get ready for work.
