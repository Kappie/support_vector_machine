I took two merit badges; canoeing and space exploration.  In canoeing, we mostly flipped our canoes over and over, and practiced different ways of getting water out of them.  We also learned different strokes, and the parts of the paddle (not oar, as our counsoler reminded us) and canoe.  In space exploration, we took some notes on space stuff (yawn), designed a space ship and space station, and built and launched model rockets. I've gotten the same rocket, the Gnome, from cub scout camp a while ago, but I lost it launching it at home.  A part of my rocket wasn't glued on good enough, so the nose cone was lost.  Guess I won't have another Gnome after all. :( On Sunday night, we had a campwide campfire, where the staff did a bunch of silly skits.  Wendsday night was parent's night.  First, we ate dinner up at the camp, which is probably the best meal all week, especialy compared to the camp food (bleah!).  There was an anything that floats race, where troops build and raced homemade boats.  Our troop entered two different boats, both made with barrels.  One of the boats broke apart and nearly sunk, but the other boat (the 'Asian Invasion' as the boys who build it named it) won second place.  Then, we had colors (when you lower the flag at the end of the day) and Order of the Arrow tapouts.  The OA is a group of scouts, both boys and adults, who have been selected by their peers (they vote).  After they get tapped out and complete an ordeal, they perform service projects, such as building stuff, for the camp.  I was tapped out, and my ordeal will most likely be at the end of August. Some of the older boys brought up a water-baloon slingshot and a bag of water baloons, which they'd been launching a little bit all week.  Another troop had a slingshot, and we had a waterbaloon war on Firday night. Our launcher broke during the second round of attacks, but we still had a blast!  After the war, we went to another campwide campfire, where troops got awards for the stuff they did during the week. Our troop got a beach ball signed by all the staff for winning a vollyball competition, and a watermellon for 2nd place in anything that floats.  Then, they showed a slide show of pictures from the week. I came home today (well, read the first sentence. I'm pretending its the July 3rd).
