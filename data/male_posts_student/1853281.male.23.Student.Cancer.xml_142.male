"*results not typical" was genius, funny, and very relevent in this day of fad diets etc. I heartilly recomend it. Brunched today with my friend A. who I have known since sixth grade, probably one of my oldest if not the oldest friend i have, and we always brunch at Keys every time she is back in the state. Good chat, just catching up. I am really enjoying the weather....fifties and overcast. Perfect.  Nothing else new,exciting or crazy. Pretty calm in my life today Finished J.H.'s socks yesterday and gave 'em to her, she really liked them and it is nice to finish a project and have something to show fer my fibre obsession.
