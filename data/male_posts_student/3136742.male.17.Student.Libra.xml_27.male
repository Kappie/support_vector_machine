I'd invite you all to come along, but I'm sure if I did only the people I wouldn't want to see tonight would accept the offer... I'm sitting here drinking a glass of 15 year old whiskey, looking like an old man... I really gotta start acting my age.   We're getting another commercial on Tuesday. That's an easy $1000, so now my parents have no excuse for not getting me a car.
