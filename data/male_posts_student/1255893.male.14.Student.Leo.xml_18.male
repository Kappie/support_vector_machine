Put under the pressure/ of walking in you're shoes.  (caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) Every step that I take is another mistake to you. (caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)  I've become so numb/I can't feel you there. I've become so tired/so much more aware. I'm becoming this/ all I want to do, Is be more like me/and be less like you.  Can't you see that you're smothering me? Holding too tightly,afraid to lose control. Cus' everything the you want me to be has fallen apart/ right in front of you.  (caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) Every step that I take is another mistake to you. (caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) And every second I waste is more than I can take.  I've become so numb/ I can't feel you there. I've become so tired/so much more aware. I'm becomiung this/all I want to do Is be more like me/and be less like you.  And I know,I may end up failing too. But I know, you were just like me  with someone dissapointed in you.  I've become so numb/I can't feel you there. I've become so tired/so much more aware. I'm becoming this/all I want to do, Is be more like me/and be less like you.
