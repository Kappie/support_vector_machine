Honestly, the last time he has gotten this good of a push was maybe when he and D-Lo were beating up the rock a few weeks before the PPV Rock Bottom in 1999. But never-the-less.  Look for Mark Henry to pull away with a sneaky victory.    Trish Stratus  Lita vs. Chris Jericho  Christian  --  Do you really think the alpha-male canadians can lose this match? YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT!!!!  Stratus and Lita win either by DQ or outside interference    Randy Orton vs. RVD (IC Title)  --  Orton has gotten a huge push by WWE and rightfully so. He, one day, will probably be the next HHH....ok maybe not. But he is very good in this story line. Look for  Randy Orton to take out RVD    Batista vs. HBK  --   Uhh...isn't HBK a jobber now?  Oh! no he just doesn't win on PPV anymore....thats it. Since his 34th comback about a year-and-a-half ago, how many PPV's has he won...maybe 4ish...at most? Besides Batista is a monster. Look for  Batista to dominate    Tag Team Turmoil  --  I have not seen enough to get a good estimate of who would win this match. But just for the sake of saying so....just for fun.... look for  Mark Jindrak  Garrison Cade to come away with a surprise victory!    Goldberg vs. Kane vs. Trips (World Title)  --  Why oh why has this belt become a joke??? WHY!!!!!! Who cares. Just because I dont care and I want to finish this blog entry.... Goldberg retains just to lose to Kane the next night.   This PPV will have its ups and downs....ending with a HUGE DOWNER! ...... uh...  thats all i guess...
