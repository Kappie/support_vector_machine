Man alive I wish our school wasn't so stinkin small and poor. On top of that, I've got history 2nd period. That totally ruins my day. History is supposed to be right after lunch cause it's the best period for sleeping in. 2nd period you are pretty much woken up and don't need to sleep. Honestly, they have no consideration for our physical needs. Or mentally if you go to my school. Fortunatley we do have study hall after lunch. It's only 30 minutes when I need my hour, but I guess it's enough sleep for me to get by. Well not in the best of moods so i'm gunna go. Later.
