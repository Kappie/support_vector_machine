My computer is back and living thanks to magnificent work from a tech guy at my dad's work and Windows XP.  I can now rip songs from CD to MP3.  I offered up Coldplay's "A Rush of Blood to the Head" as a sacraficial lamb, secretly hoping that it would eat the CD.  You know things are over exposed when you hear, oh I don't know, the beginning of "Clocks" and your eyes expect to see some MTV image of sorostitutes getting ready for a night on the town.  Actually, that song is more contemplative, so they'd probably save it for someone going to find out they have cancer.    Chapelle (sp?) Show season 1 comes out on Feb. 24.  Uncensored.  As it should be.  I am going home again next weekend because let's face it, Champaign sucks after a few years and now that I've got the means to get home on my own time, I'm going to.  Even if the accelorator sticks to the floor.  Made for interesting moments coming back home today.  I wrote a poem (FOR CLASS) about Lake Forest today and referrenced Cocaine and Heroin.  And hot dogs.  Tomorrow, or actually in less than 8 hours, I get to sit down and talk with my Dr. about feeling not so awesome.  You know things are fucked when you have to bring a list of things to discuss to an appointment.    I just found out I'm linked on Dave's site.  Hello anyone who's lookin'   Cheers.    Oh how technology is glorious (when working).
