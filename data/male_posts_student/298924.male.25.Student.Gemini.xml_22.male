First things first.....how bout those Braves?....they swept the Stros like I said they would....Look out D-Backs or Cards (it matters not which one)....  MJ played his first game for the Wiz last night....I guess I was somewhat impressed with his performance....not vintage Jordan but not too far off either....  Tennessee State and Vanderbilt are both having homecoming festivities this weekend....I stay right behind TSU so imagine the onslaught of traffic I face as my usual 2 minute commute turns into 5....  I am getting ready for this Gross Anatomy test....if people only knew how much stuff goes on in the Head and Neck region....  I am taking a small break tonight however to check out the craziest Black man in America, Mike Tyson.....I will let  urlLink these comments  say the rest....tsk, tsk....Only in America indeed!  I've been reading my old articles from the Maroon Tiger and I realize what a great time I had in undergrad....Med school so far has been an adventure....but I will never, ever get to have as much fun as I did in undergrad....  This anthrax scare really has me bugging out....as a future health professional I want to run my ass up to Metro General Hospital and get the vaccine ASAP....no use in effing around!  Oh well this post wasn't as long as I thought it would be....maybe I'll be back later....
