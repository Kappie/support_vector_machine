In the words of the divine creator himself...Lee...'i shall call him Matt the second'...'So shalt it be written, so shalt it be done' Well isnt that just fab? Not much else happened today. I have thought a bit more about my art topic...Surrealism...and i will be monitering my dreams for the next few weeks! Anyway Mush im off now to recuperate after what has been an interesting day....Signing off at 16.47 Scout Time. Tata mien Berhindet!
