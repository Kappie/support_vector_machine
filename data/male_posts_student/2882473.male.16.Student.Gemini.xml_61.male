I shall start by saying that my sister's friend/boyfriend came to stay with us yesterday and this morning, whom she met in that rain-soaked city of Bristol. He seemed quite friendly, but I didn't see much of him as they went out yesterday evening, and left this morning for a trek round London, after which he will be going back home, to wherever he lives. I did find out that he did some sort of engineering course at university (he finished a few years ago), which sounded quite interesting, and he is now involved in some sort of flood engineering thing. Apparently raising the Thames flood barrier, although protecting London, causes other areas of the conutry to flood. Anywho, I still think civil or structural engineering would be an interesting thing to do.  I've also been trying to fill my time with learning how to count in hexadecimal, which although looks difficult isn't actually too bad when you get the hand of it. You just need to add a few extra digits when you get to 9. Ie: 27, 28, 29, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F, 30, 31 etc. Very easy when you know how. Learning how to multiply in hex though, now that will be challenging. Doing this and learning Esperanto really makes you think what a hard time kids must have, needing to learn all this stuff. (Well, deciaml counting and English. Not Esperanto, obviously). I think my Esperanto is comming along nicely though, all I need is to learn some more vocabulary, and I reckon I'll be able to speak it as good as I spoke German after about a year. La malgranda knabo vidis la grandan instruiston (I think) means, 'the small boy saw the big teacher.' Yes, you can see I need to develop my vocabulary, but the language structure and grammer is there.  I'm also reading more now, and I'm definatly more than half way in Harry Potter 4. A rather good book. Oh yes, I must learn to cook during this summer, as well as learning how to pick locks, and basic escapology. These may all come in useful one day. I must go out with friends more too, as I was stuck in the house all last summer with nothing more than a computer and books to keep me occupied, and it got very depressing afte a while. Duds, we must organise some dud outings. Maybe a dud-a-thon. And what else.... ah, I've been thinking about inverting my sleep pattern, for no reason other than to check an extra box on a geek test. (I don't think it was on the one on the sidebar, another one somewhere). I will definatly have to wait until after tomorrow (my last exam) and away from any holidays my family want to take. I don't think we have anything planned yet. But going to bed at 10 in the morning and waking up at 8 at night would be weird. And depressing, as I would not have much time to talk to people, at home or on MSN. Meh, there would always be the neopets chat boards. And I also played a game of chess against an electronic chess board yesterday, which I beat fairly easily, although it was on level 1 out of 6. I think I beat level 3 once, ages ago. But it was very fun, and can keep you occupied for ages. And better than playing against a person because it makes a move almost immediately after you move, so there is no waiting whilst the opponent thinks what to do. Although it does make very stupid mistakes, and will sacrifice any of its pieces without question just to get one of yours. Maybe I can change the settings somehow...  Anywho, Business exam tomorrow, which I haven't revised for in the slightest, but meh. Thorpe Park on Tuesday will be good.  And finally... For no apparent reason, Windows Media Player has deleted all the playlists, and the ENTIRE MEDIA LIBRARY I had set up for it. I still have the music in a folder on the computer, but it has all been taken out of WMP memory. So all the playcounts have gone back to zero. :( And I'm the only person who ever uses the computer... Strangeness...  Bye for now.   Weather:  Some clouds, quite bright and warm  Reading:  Harry Potter 4  Listening to:  Star Wars Trilogy soundtrack  Watching:  Nowt again  Confused about:  Windows Media Player  Annoyed with:  Windows Media Player  Mood:  Slightly better than average
