Because my wrestler is bringing the tv and couch my room's going to feel empty for a couple days, hopefully someone on my floor will have a tv and is moving in early.  Turns out Limita is moving in early so I'm not going to be the only one from west there early, which will be nice as well.  Well time to go spend my mom's money some more probably post more later.
