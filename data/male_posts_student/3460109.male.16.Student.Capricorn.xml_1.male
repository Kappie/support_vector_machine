I'm 16 years of age and i'm currently revising for exams i have left so i can go onto either a Modern Appenticeship (electrician) or further education at college (Music)  the G.C.S.E's i have taken are; English English Literature Maths Science (double award) History Information Technology Drama Resistant Materials (Craft Technology)  the exams i'm due to take(or taken already are;  Tue 11 May- Drama (all day exam) *DONE* Mon 25 May (afternoon)- Information Technology (full/short course- 1hr 45mins) *DONE* Tue 26 May (morning)- Science (modules- 60 mins) *DONE* Fri 28 May (morning)- English Literature (1hr 45 mins) Mon 7 June (afternoon)- Science (singe and double award- 1hr 30mins) Tue 8 June (afternoon)- Maths (2hrs) Wed 9 June (afternoon)- Resistant Materials (1hr 30 mins) Thur 10 June(morning)- English (1hr 45mins) Mon 14 June (morning)- Science (double award 1hr 30mins) Mon 14 June (afternoon)- English (1hr 30mins) Tue 15 June (morning)- Maths (2hrs) Tue 15 June (afternoon)- History (2hrs) Wed 23 June (morning)- History (1hr 45mins)  after this i am free for 11 weeks. so i'm taking up a summer job untill college. in the spare time i have in the holidays, i am going to different parts of the Uk, just to see places. I am also saving up to go to New York in November with my sister, we'll save a hell of alot of money because we don't have to go in a hotel. we'll be staying at a very very very good friends house (thanks to Cayla not just for letting me stay at her house in November, but for putting up with me for so long! :-p )  things i do in my spare time consist of;  Playing Bass Listening to Music (mainly death and black metal. bands like Ulver and Mithras) Watching Tv Playing Tetris on Bladestorm ( http://forums.bladestorm.net ) Talking to people (mainly people that are downtown or on AIM or MSN) Playing NFL Hitz 2003 on Ps2(as well as other games like FFX)  At the moment i don't seem to be having the best of lives, random things just seem to happen and i get blame, i don't just sit there and take it though.  it also gets on my nerves when people 'make fun' of me because my my hair, people like that are stupid, and need a slap, Like one time, i was walking home alone from a nice drink at the pub, and as i got to my street, 4 guys started attacking me, they knocked me down from behind (typical) and they were trying to take my wallet and my phone. and as someone shouted (a guy i'd never met before, but he's a friend now) 'Oi, what the fuck are you playing at?' they ran off like scolded hounds. It's pathetic, honestly. I didn't really bother to try and avenge them, but other people did, 2 of them are now in prison, one is in hospital(i think he's out now), and the other moved down south, weird eh? i didn't even ask for anything to happen.    well. i think i'll leave it at that for now.   -Curly
