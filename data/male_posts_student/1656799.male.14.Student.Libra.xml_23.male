Anyway, the reason I decided not to go with my plan of posting about nearly everything since Saturday is that it would take too long, and not only that, but quite frankly, it was not interesting.  To sum it up though, this is what happened:-  Saturday: I get no sleep on this day, meet James fairly early-ish, and beat my record for staying up as long as possible. It now stands at approximately 30 hours. This however, has its downside, my uncle thinks I'm a weirdo. But I pwn at Halo, even when I'm nearly asleep, oh yes.  Sunday: I wake up at 4pm after having big sleep (finally), and nothing happens.  Monday: Fall asleep at about 6am. Wake up at 4pm. I play Euro 2004. End.  Tuesday: Fall asleep at around the same time as Monday. Wake up at 10am thanks to alarm clock. Go back to sleep. Wake up at 12:30pm, James is on the phone and I'm supposed to meet him. I tell him I'll meet him in an hour, I fall asleep again. Cue 1:45pm, a call from a rather annoyed James as I tell him to come to my house. We go to town, get absolutely drenched, thanks to the 'la la la, sunny . . . AAAAARGH FUCKING THUNDERSTORM!'. Go to a barbeque later.  Wednesday: omgomgomgomg fall asleep even later than ever, but not losing all my sleep. Wake up and play Euro 2004 for a while, get dressed, find the 'Stop Wars' t-shirt I want and order it. (OK, how really fucking spooky is this? As I type about the Stop Wars shirt, 'Run' by Snow Patrol comes on. How incredibly creepy! Incase you didn't know, Gary is wearing the shirt I've ordered in the 'Spitting Games' video, except mine is navy blue.)  Thursday: Emerge from bed at 7am because aaaaargh I give up trying to sleep! Grrr! Meeting James at ten.  As you might gather, I'm rather annoyed at my inability to sleep, and am now considering hitting myself over the head with several large objects before I go to bed tonight. However, for tonight though this will not be a problem as I'll fall asleep fast enough due to a complete lack of sleep today.  Thats how it works.  Its strange too, I could get two hours of sleep and still not feel tired and go to bed at about 12am, as normal. When no sleep comes into it though, by 7pm I feel faint and dizzy, and thus fall asleep ANYWHERE (hence the uncle thinking I'm weird) pretty soon after.  I'm not going to bother with any sleeping pills or anything, I'm just going to hope that this all ends pretty soon, because its starting to get to me. One plus side though, is that I'm up and now able to meet James on time! \o/  Also, in other news, today being the 5th August, this means that Fairford is two weeks away. Woo and yay, for total boredom! Houpla, for I will have nothing to do for five days, along with no internet, limited camera-age and music, and most probably no credit whatsoever!  As you can tell, I'm just brimming with excitement . . . Maybe not.  Seeing as its 9:32am now I really should be rounding off this post and getting ready to meet James, not sure what I'll do though. I'm thinking of writing some short stories when I won't have internet access in two weeks time, so I may post them on here for your viewing pleasure/pain, thats if I ever do write them. I seem to write enough anyway.  Byeeeeee.
