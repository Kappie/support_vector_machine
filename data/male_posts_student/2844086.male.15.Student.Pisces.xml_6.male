I easily answered "Uhh no!", but I thought she was playing. The thing is ... she wasn't. And she said, "Well you're on the special singer's list for tonight." That completely blew me away. I had no clue that I had to sing tonight! So I did what I always do. Flip out!  But it turned out good, because the Lord heard my cries. And You wanna know what the really funny thing is? Last night I was praying, and I asked God to use me in whatever way He chose. I didn't specify when, and I guess He took advantage of that! :) I just wasn't expecting Him to use me in the next 20 hours!  But anyway I really hope that I lead someone in worship tonight. And I hope that I really touched someone. I sang, "Wonderful, Merciful, Savior", originally recorded by Selah. And I hope that I just really blessed someone's life tonight. May the Lord have received glory tonight! 'Cause He's gonna get it anyway.
