The volcano was barely visible because of the mist and the rain (boohoo!). :P It appears that my volcano viewing bad luck has followed me to the Philippines from Costa Rica where the exact same thing happened.  The only site (or is that sight as in for sore eyes) worth seeing was Mylene's buddy. :) Well, Mylene was worth seeing too but she's my kapatid and I hadn't seen her in a while, LOL!). The director of NKTI was quite hillarious and quite the character to boot. What a very socially responsible person he is. It was a pleasure to meet Mylene's host NGO and her buddy. :)  So in regards to the volcano pics, you'll just have to imagine what it was like. As Gura said to me, 'a volcano on a lake on an island on an ocean...' or something to that effect... ;)  Oh yeah, so about this 'no romance' policy, I figure I can get around it by saying 'this kiss' or 'this hug' or what ever, 'means abosultely nothing to me as I have no romantic intentions towards you...' I'm not sure if this will work since I have a feeling it'll cause more pain (as in physical) than pleasure and I'm too nervous to try. ;)
