As I've been recovering somewhat in all areas, I tend to become terribly reflective and subdued, so I've spent most of my time thinking of Thomas, and how I can tell Ian that I'm bi. It's really important I just get it out of the way, I hate being so late out of the closet it just ripes me apart. Perhaps school would have been bearable if I did it in year 10 and not have given two flying fu . . . well you get the picture. I Promise as God is my whitness I'll post something meaningful and lengthy about him tomorrow - he deserves it because he's been overly nice and lovely to me, and I want him badly now. xBuBzx
