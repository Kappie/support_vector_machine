Also the scaffolding for the back of the house has finally gone up, so progress to getting a larger room is being made. It's about time, too. Houses are now being built at the bottom of my extensive garden, and building work on the house needs to resume. Sixth form and GCSE results loom, so I am becoming increasingly twitchy. Much coffee and falling over helps this. Nothing much else has happened. I've decided to have a quiet day. I appear to have upset a certain person (If you are reading this, read my post below. I apologise for starting the argument, but that in no way means you are correct.), but apart from that all is calm. I've just watched Die Hard 2, a film worthy of being called so, as John Mclaine (Is that how you spell it?) does indeed appear to be invincible. But it was good anyway, containing just the right amount of explosions and gunfire. I'd like to say that is not everything I look for in a film, ut mostly it is. Anyway, bye for now. Will post again tomorrow.
