Well anyway, today was fun cuz it was Saturday and Tyke didn't do anything mentally strenuous.  He got up after 11 and watched TV for a while before coming online and talking about Prom stuff and tux shopping for the day.  At 1:30 Tyke, Amed, Macaroon, and K-Caj all met up at the Factoria Mall where they looked at tuxes.  Tyke became a rep so he should be able to get a pretty damn cheap tux or even free.  He didn't actually get his tux yet but he's gonna get all white again.  But yeah, if you need a tux come to Tyke and he'll give you a card so that you can help him out when you get your tux.  Tyke will try to help you out some other way too.  But he won't give you head like K-Caj offered.  Ewww.  After that Dr. Phil met up with the gang and they went to K-Caj's house to play some Halo.  Then Tyke went home and had dinner with his family at DC's Steakhouse up on the plateau and they talked about their trip to Europe.  Then Tyke came home and Dr. Phil, Macaroon, Kinker, Skippy, and Amed all came over.  They played some rousing games of Taboo and every single time Tyke's team won.  That shows how good Tyke is at Taboo.  So pick Tyke for your partner.  The last game it was Tyke and Skippy teamed up and they had 0 after Skippy gave clues because he isn't exactly the best clue-giver.  Well Amed had thought that the game was over once he beat Macaroon and Dr. Phil's score.  Tyke had to get 9 to tie.  Well he went on a roll and got 11 right without any minus points and ended up winning.  It was great.  Tyke is great.  Tyke is tight.  That's tight.  All night long the gang thought about prom stuff and group situations and all of that mumbo jumbo.  It actually set things up really well and they seem to be pretty set on their ways now.  But now they have decided that they probably need to do pre-everything pictures at 4-4:15.  That means that everyone has to be ready by then.  It is unknown yet whether or not that causes a problem.  Hmmm...let's hope not.  Anyway, they filmed a really good video after playing taboo and that is why Tyke has Sharpie pen all over him.  You'll see the video sometime.  It's good.  Super hot good.  Super hot t-shirt off good.  Tomorrow might kinda suck cuz Tyke has to do the Grad Project Portfolio all tomorrow.  Which is gay.  Gay gay.  Bye bye.
