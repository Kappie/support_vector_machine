Bah.  Also, Johnny Depp for Best Actor?  For Pirates of the Caribbean?  Have they gone insane?  I think either Seabiscuit or Mystic River will win best picture.  Ben Kingsley will win Best Actor for House of Sand and Fog, and Charlize Theron will win Best Actress for Monster.    Oddly, I have seen none of those other than Seabiscuit, which was muddled and slow.  I wouldn't choose it, but the Academy likes those types of movies.
