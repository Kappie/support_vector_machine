I did get 7th in my International Business contest.  The worst part of the week was the fact that most of the girls there were very sexxy. As I spent alot of time thinking about how pretty many of them are I came to a way of defining the words I describe them with. So I present you with: THE TROUTSMEG SCALE OF BEAUTY!! *dun dun daaaaa* It is devided into levels of rank as to what title is higher or lower in value than the others. Those on the same level are equal in value for you math-chalanged people. All examples are subject to change as is anyone not mentioned.  First Level  PRETTY:  This is the lowest on THE TROUTSMEG SCALE OF BEAUTY. It is not derogatory because I don't think most if any girls, or guys, are totally unpretty. I say "pretty" when she is not my type at the moment. This might be due to any number of factors from eyes to breasts to feet. Ex: Drew Barrymore  Second Level  SEXXY*: Someone who is "sexxy" must make me want to have sex with them. There are varying sublevels of this from ugly sexxy to eligent sexxy to kinky sexxy. This title is earned by me just looking at the person. Ex: Uma Thurman  Third Level  CUTE:  A "cute" girl is a girl that I find somewhat physically attractive because of what she says and the way she says things. A girl dubed "cute" has very high mobility in THE TROUTSMEP SCALE OF BEAUTY. She could move up the levels very quickly, but she also can go down as well. It all depends on our convesations and my mood. Ex: Katie Rainey  HOT:  A "hot" girl is a girl that I find somewhat mentally attractive because of what she looks like and does. Mobility is also high here too. Ex: Ariel  Forth Level  BEAUTIFUL:  This girl is both "hot" and "cute" with her mental and physical beauty. How I pine for this type of girl. Ex: Abigail   While I was in Denver I found the timezone to be godaweful. It does not jive with the rest of the U.S. and it attracts panhandlers. I hate people unproductive to society. I did also have a waitress wait on me that looked alot like Katie Rainey. She made me realize how cute I think Katie is.   *I spell "sexxy" with two X's because of the They Might Be Giants song "S-E-X-X-Y."
