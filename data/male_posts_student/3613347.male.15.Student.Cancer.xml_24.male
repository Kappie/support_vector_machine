She has also cheated her brother of quite a sum of money, which she spent to buy a iPod Mini(U call that pink?). And it was THAT iPod Mini that now holds my precious robbed items.  My 140 songs... all robbed from my dear computer. Years of effort, all snatched away by one puny obsolete noise producer.  Ai ya... cut the crap. Anyway, she downloaded 140 songs from my computer into her iPod. Nothing is free in this world.  Wonder what she can give me in return.   Offered her an option of paying 2 dollars per song;rejected Offered her an option of paying 140 dollars in total;rejected  I have another option for u.    BE MY SLAVE!!!!
