(meaning I'm both smart AND big), I can't get a freaking job this summer!  I went to five or six landscaping places today and asked if any of them needed summer workers - nada.  Put in an application at Lowe's - haven't heard back.  Talked to folks from two roofing companies - all filled.  Heck, I even sent an e-mail (plea?) to Lianda, but I haven't heard back from them, either (in fairness, I sent it Wed.)!  Ah well, suppose I'll have to keep scouring the classifieds and keeping up with the stuff here around the house.  Oh, and I'm sending out my law-firm canvassing letters today (38 of them at last count), so MAYBE I'll snag something there.  And as if not having a job wasn't bad enough, now I can't eat virtually anything I really like! :P  I have to admit I never realized how much stuff was in most of the things we eat - I wasn't exactly a "label-watcher" - but not that I'm on Atkins it's kinda crazy how much stuff I CAN'T eat.  I mean, my three main food groups were bread, pasta, and Cool-Aid (I lived off frozen pizzas for over a month in DC :D) - now, all of them are out the door.  The things we do to be "healthy"...
