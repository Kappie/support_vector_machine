I mean I think I do but I'm not sure.  I really hate this and what is worse is Lisa doesn't see how it is hurting me.  After talking to her for 25 minutes tonight I just wanted to cry.  I feel like she doesn't want me in her life anymore or that everything she says to me is forced.  I almost want to nail her down and try explaining everything to her but IDK.  I'd rather know I'm hated or whatever than her pretending and me wondering.  Life aside from Lisa is good.  Jill should be at YG this Friday which would be great.  Lisa still doesn't know if she is coming to YG.  I'm undecided on that one.  IDK.  I found my new life's verse.  Proverbs 24:13a "Eat thou honey my son for it is good."  Who says God isn't a guy?  Well as down as I am sounding I am not all that depressed.  I am just confused and not liking how things are.  I ran 9 miles today and did 75 pushups already.  I've got to do more if I want to meet my goal of 1000.  I'm going to be so ripped soon.
