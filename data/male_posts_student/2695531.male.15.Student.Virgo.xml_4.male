Peter Bacanovic, her former broker, hasalso received a 5-month sentence. While we all have our views on Martha I would like to comment on how the media and the federal government went so far out of their way to degrade this woman as much as they possibly could. It is rumored that if it weren't for the rivalry between state and federal government officials on charging people as severely as possible, she would not be in this deep. After the collapse of Enron and the injustice Ken Lay and his sleezbag corporate pals did to the employees and stock-holders there, I think the government is trying to convey a message. The government wants to make an example of a person like Martha Stewart to discourage any more business scandals. While I believe the government  should  be hunting down"white collar" criminals, I don't believe that it should be allowed to "create" a case and ruin a possibly innocent person's career. Then again, thats just my opinion.
