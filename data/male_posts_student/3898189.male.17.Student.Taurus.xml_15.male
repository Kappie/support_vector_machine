So I probably stayed up until like 1:00  writing and pasting pictures inside it. ( the only people I need to paste inside it is a pic of Rhae ( like that will ever happen) and one of Greg...then that would complete the notebook and I can move on to the next note book journal...I think...  I also forgot to call Rhae and I feel terible about it...I keep saying that I will call her...But I am not trying to make excuses so I am just going to stop that right there.   Last night Mike and Sheryl came over last night...and we played some DOA3 and Capcom vs SNK EO 2...that was alot of fun.  Until he left then I did nothing but watch Blue collar Tv and think. (There's some good news...) BUT THE SWOLLING ON MY FOOT WENT DOWN!  But Once again I have been a bit depressed and feeling like I am going to Vomit all over the place. (there is a nice mental image)  But something is keeping me going...and it is not Drawing this time...and venting by writing it out hasnt helped me much either.   *sigh* I wish I was an anime character...they look like so much fun to be... and so care free.  OH WELL!
