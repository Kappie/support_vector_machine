I had just ifnished my coursework last night and restarted my PC innocently, only for it to die on me.  I managed to save my coursework on an NTFS DOS floppy disk quickly for today and here I am without a PC at the moment.  I've installed Windows on my backup partition and am just waiting now to format again so I can reinstall.  I just can't understand why my PC keeps doing this to me whenever I install XP.  Maybe there is some secret option I keep missing which states "Automatically delete some random important system files after 30 days", and of course, it is checked!  Anyway...  Today was kinda cool.  Started off okay in Maths, followed by a dos around lesson in ICT Shortcourse.  Geography was a nightmare.  Sam got sent out for tapping the desk (wtf?!!) and when he came back, Miss Taylor overheard me moan about it lol,  Whoops!  English was normal and ICT was really good.  Some people from Keele university had taken over our lesson for us to test out a beta version of a cool CD for kids about further education.  It was really good, the graphics were amazing and there was this cool little virtual game.  I gotta go now and sort out my computer... wheeee!
