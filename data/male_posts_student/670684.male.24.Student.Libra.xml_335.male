IN AMERICA was something I wanted to see when it was at the Austin Film Festival, but grabass ensued and I missed it.  Hit it today, and it's one of those films that just leaves you wanting to do good things with yourself.  That and BIG FISH are both great feel-good films from recently.    No sign of the father yet.  Not too upset about that.  A pretty basic vacation so far...noting too special.  Got a facial yesterday...before the jokes start up, I've got to say it was a glorious hour spent on my face.  And now someone can search this site with the phrase "spent on my face."
