  urlLink  The Road to Serfdom   is an excellent book about the dangers of state control over the means of production (i.e., socialism), which was published in 1944. It's only 274 pages, but some of my blog readers seem to balk at anything longer than a paragraph, so I found a cartoon version. Click on the cover page above.
