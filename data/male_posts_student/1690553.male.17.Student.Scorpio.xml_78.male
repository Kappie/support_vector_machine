Alhamdulillah, my younger sister and cousin is one of them. I SMSed Datin Ezizah, how's SMART doing. We managed to get 57 straight As scorers - 21 9As, 21 8As, and the rest is 7As. Sound a little low than last year but don't forget, a few classes of this batch had been transferred to Sri Kuantan.  My younger sister who got 5As in UPSR managed to get a place in SMART. The Orientation will start this Sunday.  The wedding of Uncle Fadzlu is confirmed also. The 'Akad Nikah' ceremony will be held on the night of 1st May 2004, the reception at Desa Bakti, Mentakab, Pahang will be held the next day. While the reception at our side at Pagoh, Muar, Johor will be held on 3rd May 2004.   Meanwhile, Uncle Azwan had officially propsed his girlfriend last Wednesday and gave her a 'cincin tanda'. The engagement will be around March next year. Well, looks like next year would be quite busy.
