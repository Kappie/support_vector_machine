When we were runnin, a friend unintentionally kicked my foot from behind, causing me to trip over another friend's foot and fall on my  left  side.Had a few scratches on the area just  left  of my knee. other than that i was alright and carried on running. Second one was when we were in the IT Room having CD. Me and two of mah peeps couldn't find anymore chairs, so we decided to use broken ones instead. The only problem about these chairs was that their back cushion could not stand up. I stupidly tried to fix it and ended getting my  left  thumb scratched by some metal part below the chair. Man, it was a quite a bad cut. Skin peeled off and a few minor scratches surrounded the more serious ones. Lost quite some blood too. Washed the wound before going down to the genral office to get it bandaged. Accompanying was Weiliang or Mr. Welfare. He helped the office staff in applying anticeptic and the bandaging process. Very thankful of him for that. The last injury happened just today. We were in the hall preparing for the Racial Harmony skit. Me and some others were kicking a soccer ball all over the house when i accidentally slided on the ball (opps!) and fell on my  left  side! My  left  arm was knocked real hard and the pain lingered long after the impact. It was so painful that i thought i broke my arm. The real point is that what's with my left side???? Why are all the injuries on the left??? What's next? My left side of my hair getting shaved off?? this is so lame....and painful...
