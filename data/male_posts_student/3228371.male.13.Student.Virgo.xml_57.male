I'll tell you how it hurts... it hurt that he kept it from me. That he wasn't honest with me. I was honest with him about the Nathan thing because I wanted HIM to, in turn, be honest with me. But he wasn't. It hurt that he kept that from me. I asked him what was wrong before and he never said anything. Now I know... after reading it. But... I won't know anymore whether he's being honest with me or not... he probably won't blog there anymore or type out his feelings and worries/troubles. I wouldn't know if he was hiding anything... That's what I don't like... he wanted me to be comfortable around him and stuff but... I can't do that without honesty, and being open with each other. I've gotten myself to be totally honest with him about everything and I'm totally open with him about anything... but he kept that from me. Even though he says he won't do that anymore and would be honest, I don't think he will. He probably will just hide everything and not even blog it out... *sighzZ* Fuck it... nothing I can do. Wish I could change it and never have told him I knew.
