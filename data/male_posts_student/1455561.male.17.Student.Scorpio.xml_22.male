I think the fact that i keep having dreams where i have to take more GCSEs without any warning must say something about what i feel, although apparently people still have dreams like this when they are much older, such as the brilliant comic/writer, richard herring (link below)  i was caught by dominic online the other day so i had to speak to him, but to make sure i didnt go mental at him, mark joined the conversation and abused him for me.  apparently the smug git is doing exams in practically any order he can think of, so in total i think he will have done 4 A-levels and 4 GCSEs by next year.  we can only hope then that he will go to uni a year early and end up killing himself or going mental like most people do who go early or go with bizarre social skills.  All i know though is that he uses words like "bummer" when you tell him something bad and "hehe" instead of lol, so to me that is reason enough to still feel hatred tinged with fear.
