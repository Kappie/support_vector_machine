Anyway, there's nothing really going on with me lately. Tomorrow I'll go home for Mother's Day and sunday will be one year to the day that I graduated from Duke. It's amazing because it seems like it was yesterday.   Speaking of it feeling like it was yesterday, today I got a call from Michael Barham of all people. He was on a 7-hour layover at DFW so I got to go pick him up and show him the Fort Worth scene. Michael Barham was my graduate assistant (RA-boss of sorts) my senior year at Duke. The last time I saw him was a year ago on graduation day.   I guess that's it. See ya later.   Songs of the day   Interstate Love Song , Stone Temple Pilots, 1994.   Lonely People , America, 1975.
