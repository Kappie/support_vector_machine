I think there was only one or two things I disagreed with in it, namely the flashlight and health readout. Bungie's said health is gone, but this guy seems to be in denial. I don't really feel like correcting him, so oh well. And the flashlight? Well, I haven't seen it yet. Have you? Has it been mentioned? Yes, it was. The white button is now team chat in multiplayer instead of flashlight. So why would the flashlight be gone from multiplayer? I think it isn't- the flashlight will now be weapon-specific. Remember how the AR and shotgun had lights on them? Well, yeah. I believe that in Halo 2 you'll have to find a weapon that has a light to be able to use it. Anyway, here's that writeup:   urlLink http://members.aol.com/duskywolf/private/halo2_guide.zip   After reading that, I have no idea how anyone would be able to deny Halo 2's glory. I'm salivating over it. Ewwy.
