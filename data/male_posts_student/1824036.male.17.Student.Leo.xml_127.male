I took a shower but threw up while in it, but I still felt like I should go. So I did.  I felt pretty good for the most of the day. I even had enough energy to play a little bit of basketball, although I really messed up my back while simply bending over to pick up a ball. My back still kills and I need to go lay down.  While at lunch I felt really tired, almost like dizzy. I thought I was going to pass out, and now I am here. At my home. Hooray for me...NOT! Well anyways. Thats the story morning glory.  Peace!
