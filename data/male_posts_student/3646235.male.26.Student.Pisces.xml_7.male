People can have what ever they want (they keep moving to a new house to get away from their neighbors), but no one is happy.  He moves to Heaven with some Ghosts from the town and watches their story.  Each Ghost has a problem they hae hung onto from their life and they can not let go.  If they would let go and love God, they would become more solid and be able to walk to Heaven.  They were to selfish or took good things to extremes, like loving a child but not loving God.  I went and bought more books by Lewis, and I'll post my thoughts on them when I'm finished.  I really liked this version of Heaven.
