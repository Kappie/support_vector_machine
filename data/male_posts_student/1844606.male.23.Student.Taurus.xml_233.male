I like both Boston and Cubs, but speaking from a Boston fan, jesus, what the hell were you thinking?  First, way to go with alienating an All-Star and fucking the situation ("trading" for A-Rod) up so badly that you trade him for a couple of sub .250 hitters and some minor leagures.  In regards to Theo Epstien, how exactly is the problem "fixed" as you put it?  Defense might be better and you may have rid yourself of a "problem" by getting rid of Nomar, but you could have at least gotten equal value for him.  But maybe something is better than nothing.  If Nomar was slighted by your team President, GM, and sometimes 1B, maybe he had a right to be displeased. Rumor has it, Nomar was getting so fed up in Beantown that he considered sitting for 3 weeks while recouping from his achilles problem.  Nomar might be showing signs of slowing down after missing most of a season a few years ago with a broken wrist and is now hobbled by an achilles,  but no matter how you slice it, he is a massive upgrade over Gonzo.  On the other side, as of now, the trade can only be seen as an absolute steal.  Who knows what the prospects the Cubs gave away will become, or even if Nomar will stay past Oct (all indications are he would like to) but unless Beltran turns into the second coming of Dontrell Willis or any number of other Cubs pitching prospects that have been shipped away in recient years, this looks pretty solid.   Lets face it, Bartman was not the only reason the Cubs blew game 6 last year.  Anyone remember the ole job Gonzo pulled?  The man that was hearlded for his defensive prowless.  Yeah.  Garciaparra's bat at the top or middle of the Cubs lineup will give it some much needed consistancy and baserunners, and his defense is still solid.  If Sammy wasn't a puss he'd accecpt moving to the 5th or 6th slot in the line up and let players who hit move up and have him see better pitches.  He should also realize he's not putting the ball in play and be man enough to ask for help with his swing cause it ain't working.  More middle relief for the Cubs would have been nice, but the possibility of a waiver trade is there for the next month or so and everyone is coming back from injuries.  Once Wood and Prior are able to go 6 or 7 solid innings, the bullpen will get some help as well.  That being said, the closer job is still very loose, but I'm glad the Cubs didn't go after Urbina or Jose Mesa because neither have been consistantly reliable in the past two years.   That's my take on baseball.    PS   Moving out in 90 heat sucks massively.
