First of all there is the book by the greatest President of the 20th century, if not in all of American history, Bill Clinton, the last elected president of the United States.  How many interviews have been on in the last few days?  Did you see the  urlLink BBC Interview ?  He apparently got a little angry about the Ken Starr investigation and how the media let Starr abuse his power.  The conservative pundits on cable (especially FOX NEWS) are having a field day.  Last night I was watching "HANNITY and colmes" (that's the way the show seems to be run, anyway) and Sean Hannity was saying how the leaders of the Democratic Party are going crazy (Howard Dean, Al Gore, and now Bill Clinton).    What else is going on?  John Kerry is going to pick his running mate in a few weeks.  I think that he is going to pick North Carolina Senator John Edwards.  He's basically an innocent Bill Clinton.  He is young, southern, charismatic, and from the south.  He would be able to run for President in 2012, when Kerry's time would be up.  I really think that Edwards will be the Veep.  I guess we will see in a few weeks if I am right or wrong.
