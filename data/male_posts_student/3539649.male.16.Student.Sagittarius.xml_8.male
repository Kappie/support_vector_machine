The Pasta Dude (4:42:03 PM): they're hurting my brain, cause today i was looking at my knee and just staring at the briuse on it as it bled, and i wondered "Wouldn't it be awesome if there was some adhesive piece of cloth that would remain on my leg to collect all the blood so that I could still move but not get blod on my pants?" then i saw the box of band-aids and said "I know! I'll take this carabord box to my knee! That'll work!" and so now i am sitting here with caraboard taped to my leg cause i forgot that band-aids kick ass  the only people getting anything good out of these tests are pornographers... 1500 chaminade students + stuck home to study = porn....anyway its ilke 5 and i have the house to myself for hours but i have to resist doing anything fun so i can read words in a language i will never use except while trying to pick up girls at taco bell...addios amigos
