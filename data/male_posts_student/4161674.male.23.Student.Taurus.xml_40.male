It was nice to catch up with so many people T-- and I have met over the last five years and make some new acquaintances, too.  Being a seminary and all, our opening session on Saturday morning had a worship band. It featured an -- uh, shall we say "interesting" bass player. While the rest of the band played the worship standard, "Lord I Lift Your Name On High," the bass player was perfectly content to plunk away on the bass line from "The Joker" by Steve Miller Band. I was hoping that the next song would be "Shout to the Lord" to the tune of "Fly Like an Eagle," but no such luck. The best part of the set came when a band member's jacket fell on the floor and the bassist stopped playing in the middle of the song, walked across the platform, picked up and carefully folded the jacket, set it down on top of a monitor, and finally schlumped back to the rest of the band to finish the song. (I found out later that he was a last minute replacement for the band's regular bassist. Good thing!)  We also had the good fortune of knowing our host couple, with who we shared our meals and received a tour of the campus via the local Starbucks. It was great visiting, but I did have a strange sense of deja vu being led around from classroom to classroom. It finally occurred to me that I had done something very similar thirty years previous during Kindergarten Roundup!  T-- and myself love school and really enjoyed sitting in the sample classes at the colleges. There was just something very charming about the two of us sharing a classroom, although she was the one who carried my books around! Actually we missed out on a great deal of the classroom instruction as a faulty fire alarm necessitated evacuations of the building three times on Saturday.  The wide-eyed innocence of kindergarten roundup coupled with the high-school highjinks of false alarms -- now that's what I call a well-rounded educational experience!
