But what am I in your eyes?  0100000101101110001000000110000101100011011100010 1110101011000010110100101101110011101000110000101 1011100110001101100101 (An acquaintance?)  0100000100100000011001100111001001101001011001010 110111001100100 (A friend?)  0101001101101111011011010110010101110100011010000 1101001011011100110011100100000011011010110111101 11001001100101 (Something more?)  Am I so conveniently broken down, Categorized, and filed away, Just another fragment in your mind?  Or are we two like those stars, Eternally bound? Separate entities, born again as one, To light the skies.
