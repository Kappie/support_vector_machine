Golfers (which I a now a member of the "brethren") tell me Golf is a great game to work on patience and discipline, maybe true. I went to the driving range last night, there was a guy there hitting golf balls longer than I can walk!!!!!!!!!!! While I was hoping 1) not to hit anyone with an errand golfball, especially myself and 2) at least outdrive the eight year old on the tee right beside me. It is good to have goals ain't it?! I can "proudly" say I have at least achieved those specific goals, now for some more higher dreams to achieve. I was once was a romantic, idealistic dreamer yet as I have gotten older, I am either getting more content or more cynical with my life. I would appreciate comments on what is "appropiate dreaming" b/c the Bible expouses two views of this, one Jesus tells us not to worry about tomorrow but focus upon today, yet Paul will say God can do more than we ask or imagine. I know goal-setting and the inner-striving in us for perfection perhaps may not be relevant to this discussion, yet I personally have a difficult time discerning between egoism and a healthy "forceful laying hold of" of the kingdom of heaven. I try to be neutral, which is deadly what lies within the center of the road, roadkill!!!!!!! I am a "cautious optimist" I say "well God this is something I want to do or have, Do you think this is a good idea? Well, even if this is do you think you will give it to me? And if you give it to me, do you think I will enjoy it? And if I enjoy it will it pull me away from you?" Sometimes I ask so many questions I eventually forget what I was originally asking for!!!!!!!!    Again off on another tangent, I do welcome comments on this b/c I see others who are bold in asking things and I covet their kind of faith, yet I am also envious of those who forsake all for the kingdom of heaven, like monks, I wish I could just as bold in those situations as well. These questions have been asked for eternity, admist the fog of my mind and my faith, I do have the clarity in which I live and worship a loving, heavenly father who wants the very best for me and my brothers and sisters. I suppose the "safe" (that is truly tongue-in-cheek) way is to emulate Jesus in our lives. He did never possessed many material things, he never had a high-ranking political position, he was arrested as a "terrorist" and he died with what he came into the Earth with, tears and a deep faith in his Heavenly Father. I believe he was (and is) the richest man ever known. What he has achieved is truly great for the glory he bought is so much it spills over in the lives of his children, may we be content in this knowledge but even more "hedonistic" in receiving his glory.    James 1:17  Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. 18 He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.
