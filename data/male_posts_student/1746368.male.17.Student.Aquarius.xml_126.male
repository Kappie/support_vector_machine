Sometimes there were two sets of footprints.  Other times there were one set of footprints.   This bothered me because I noticed that  During the low periods of my life when I was   Suffering from anguish, sorrow, or defeat,  I could see only one set of footprints,  So I said to the Lord, "You promised me,  Lord, that if I followed You, You would walk with me always.   But I noticed that during the most trying periods  Of my life there have only been  One set of prints in the sand.   Why, When I have needed You most, You have not been there for me?"  The Lord replied,  "The times when you have seen only one set of footprints Is when I carried you."  --Not me, unfortunately. It's a good poem.  urlLink
