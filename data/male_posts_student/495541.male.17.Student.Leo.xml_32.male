One would be that very little people come to this site.  Another would be that they simply don’t comment.  Whatever the case, I have no comments.  Perhaps I seem to have nothing worth commenting on.  That’s probably the case, I think.  So maybe I should start talking about stuff that’s more interesting.  I think that your typical ‘I’m tired, I hate off-season workout, song of the day, good night’ posts are boring.  So I think I’m going to go more into depth and try something new.  Go ahead and make a comment on what you think I should talk about in the future.  First thing I want to talk about is my headphones.  Currently I have a very low quality audio setup on my computer.  I have cheap onboard audio as well as cheap Logitech speakers.  These are nice cheap speakers though.  They have an audio jack in the back and have a volume control.  They have no bass though so I can’t really get the full effect.  (At this point my computer locked up, but thankfully Microsoft Word has a lovely AutoRecover feature.)  Where was I?  My setup goes from the PC to the speakers to the headphones.  I know for a fact that the noise is generated from the speakers.  When I plug the headphones directly into the motherboard, I get no screeching noise.  This concludes that the noise is generated by the speakers.  The solution would be to buy better speakers.  I think I will save up, buy a better sound card, as well as speakers and some lovely leather padded headphones (the huge ones that cover your ears and don’t hurt.  That’s all for now.  I need to be going to bed now.  Good night.
