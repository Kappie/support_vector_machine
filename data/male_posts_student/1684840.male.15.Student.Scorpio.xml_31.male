Lots of loud rumbling and flashing (no not that type, the lightning you pervert :P)  I had a great veiw...from the centre of my back garden!  I got absolutely soaked, but it was worth it, and I even took a trip to the local Tesco Express in it too, with a few funny glances from shoppers because I was drenched and my shoes were making a squeaky noise on the shiny floor!  Weather is so entertaining :D
