From:   jlessek@hotmail.com Subject: yo Date: June 13, 2004 8:04:55 AM CDT To:   navonodfj@yahoo.com, jastava@yahoo.com So I don't know if we're still planning on a blog or anything, but we could also start screenplay ideas for situations/characters/etc going via e-mail.     I was thinking about my brother and my dad and the situation with his girlfriend Lynda yesterday, and I think it would be funny if we had a 30 year old character whose father just recently re-married, and the 30-year old is all bitter about having a new mom, even though clearly he's out of the house and it hardly affects him.  The woman won't try to order him around or anything, but if she offers him something at dinner or whatever, he can get all upset like a 13-year old girl and do a big "you're not my real mom and you can't tell me what to do" thing.     So I think it would be nice (and easy) if we somehow had a plot that involved a few different people that we could loosely model after ourselves (or at least one normal guy and then a few other funnier characters a la Old School, or else one teacher, one corporate- or ex-corporate-world dude, and one military), so maybe we just need the situation.  They could either BE friends, or be thrown into some random situation where they all meet.     What do you dudes think?     J     From:   jlessek@hotmail.com Subject: more ideas Date: June 15, 2004 2:26:07 PM CDT To:   jastava@yahoo.com, jack.donovan@gmail.com I don't know what kind of ideas you guys have in mind, but it might be funny if we made fun of those JACKASS and wildboyz guys and did a movie about three dudes (we could loosely base them on us) who are like 27 years old, made a bunch of money by being on a JACKASS-style show, and then are out of jobs when the show eventually fizzles and their popularity goes down... then they're trying to figure out what they want to do.  They could all give some normal type of job a shot, and then realize that they can't do anything like that.  Meanwhile, these guys think they're awesome at music and stuff because they used to be on the popular show, so we can have them play some funny/half-sucky punk rock type songs in a band.  Eventually, they decide that because they can't make it in the real world, they need to pull off some huge stunt to get the media's attention again...  (I don't know what that stunt is, but it will be sweet.)  Just another idea...

In the real world, our characters could try pulling "crazy pranks" on people, but instead of everyone laughing or liking them, they would just punch them or beat the shit out of them.  Like maybe one guy is working a temp office job, and he tries to cut some dude's hair while the guy is talking on the phone or doing something, and then instead of laughing everyone just stares at him and he gets fired.  And it would also be funny to show clips from old episodes of the show (which should have a ridiculous but also plainly stupid name playing off of jackass... like 'smart-alecks' or 'jerks' or something).  The old clips can show them doing "crazy" stunts and making "crazy" faces as they jump into the camera at funny angles and do other zany things (sorry for all the quotation marks in that last sentence).  So also, the plot could be that they stage something huge to become famous again - like setting up and paying some friend to rob a bank so that they can mysteriously save the day.  They plan and plan for it, but eventually just get busted and arrested (thus, somewhat cheesily, getting the media and notoriety that they had wanted in the first place).  Just another idea...
