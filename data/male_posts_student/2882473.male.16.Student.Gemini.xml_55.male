Today's blog will actually have some reason/bestimmung for being written, which certainly makes a change from those random pictures and 'I did revision etc' blogs. Today I shall blog about a very special event that occured on Tuesday, and continuing onto Thursday. An event so important, that it had been planned for days before. An event that was so crucial, that failure was not an option. An event that was  Operation Commie Nazi.  First of all, here is the plan, in Matrix style, of course. NB, the people in this plan are my and my friends nations on that website Nationstates (link on side). I'm Pisylvania, Valmar is dickybod,  Polok is megatrobe, Cax is nonnesuch, and Commie Sausage is Deutsches D. The rest are other friends. Enjoy :)  Pisylvania: There's a classroom. Inside this classroom there's a poster which no person appreciates, and which few people like. This poster is filled with pictures. These pictures show many things, holy things, but one picture is special. One pictures shows the Commi Nazi. This school is protected by a very loud fire alarm. Every setting off triggers the evacuation. Salian: evacuation? Did he say evacuation? Pisylvania: But like all alarms it has a weakness. The alarm is placed in the school. Strict teachers guard the alarms. Valmar: Jakubovic. Pisylvania: If one person is caught, so must the other be. Cax: Someone gets caught at the alarm, no poster. Red Islands: But you'd have to make several pupils talk to distract a teacher like that. Pisylvania: Not several, 27. Salian: 27 pupils? Pisylvania: There is a person. He must be the distraction. Cax: Jako must have some kind of failsafe. Pisylvania: Yes, he does not get easily distracted. Someone must wear trainers in the school. This must be the distraction. Flinndoglo: Then what do you need us for? Valmar and Polok could take the poster and do the alarm easier than we could. Pisylvania: There's no time. Cax: Why? Pisylvania: Once the alarm is activated, the bells will be ring. But the school will be evacuated immediately. Red Islands: How long will that take? Pisylvania: Exactly 314 seconds. Flinndoglo: Just over 5 minutes. Pisylvania: That is the length and breadth of the window. Only The One can steal the poster, and only during that window can the poster be taken. Cax: How do you know all this? Pisylvania: I know because I must know. The poster's my purpose. It's the reason I'm here. Same reason we're all here.  Necronz: Valmar, I know something will go wrong. You don't have to tell me. I just want you to know that I'm here.  Pisylvania: Both must be done as one.  Jermasoy: Trainers can't hurt.  Pisylvania: If one fails, both fail.  Valmar: At breaktime, there's an absense of teachers in the classroom. At breaktime, we will strike.  Mr Guy: Hey! You drink coffee at home. Mr Herbert: Why, I get paid to drink it â€˜ere.  Perundia: Okay, break's started. Protonese: How much time? Perundia: 12 minutes. Protonese: Oh swud!  Valmar: All of this year we have worshipped this poster. Today I believe we can take it. That poster was not an accident. There are no accidents. It was not drawn by chance. I do not believe in chance when I see 1 objective, 1 distraction, 1 poster. I do not see coincidence, I see providence, I see purpose. I believe the poster brought us here. The poster has power. I believe this poster holds for each and every one of us the very meaning of Commi Nazis.  Commi Sausages: I want to ask you to do something, but I don't know how. Necronz: I promise you, if I can, I will. Commi Sausages: What if I asked you to stay out of this, no matter what. To stay out of the classroom? Necronz: Why? Commi Sausages: Please. Necronz: All right.  Valmar: What is it, Cax? Cax: I can't help it, Valmar, I can't help thinking - what if you're wrong. What if all this - the poster, everything - is bullswud. Valmar: Then tomorrow we may all have detentions, but how would that be different from any other day? This is a school, and we are pupils. Detention can come for us at any time, in any place.  Protonese: Jakubovic!. Incoming! Incoming!  Valmar: Now consider the alternative. What if I am right? What if the Commi Nazi is a God? What if tomorrow the God could be ours. Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't that worth getting a det for?  Flinndoglo: Time?  Salian: 3 minutes. Blood and Water: Almost there.  Pisylvania: It is time.  Necronz: Find the others. Jermasoy: Got Cax right there, they're already in the Concourse. Necronz: What about Flinndoglo? Jermasoy: There, they're still inside, but... Necronz: They're in Jako's classroom.  Valmar: That's it, let's go.  Necronz: Call Commi Sausages now. Jermasoy: Lost them. They're inside the classroom block. Necronz: What about the fire alarm? Jermasoy: Everything's still operational. Fire alarm hasn't been set off. Jesus. As soon as they take that poster, it's all over. Necronz: The hell it is. Jermasoy: What are you... Necronz? Necronz: I will not stand here and do nothing. I will not wait here to watch them get a detention. Jermasoy: Necronz, we're talking less then 5 minutes here. Necronz: In 5 minutes, I'll set that whole goddamn alarm off.  Commi Sausages: How much further? Pisylvania: Here, just here. Jakubovic: I'm sorry, this is out of bounds.  Jermasoy: It's gotta be the ugliest rule I have ever broken. That's as close as I can get ya. You better run very fast. Jermasoy: Operator. Necronz: I'm in. Jermasoy: Keep moving, fire control system.  Jakubovic: I am surprised to see you here, Commie Sausages, that's the difference between us. I've been looking for you. Commi Sausages: What do you want, Jako? Jakubovic: Oh you haven't figured that out? Still breaking all the rules except the ones that don't matter. I want exactly what you don't want. I want you to get a det. Valmar: Would that include even during an evacuation? Jakubovic: Go ahead, set off the alarm. The best thing about me - I never forget faces.  Computer Room Technician: Christ, what happened in here? Computer Room Guard: Hold it right there, little lady.  Jakubovic: If you can't get one now, get one later. Commi Sausages: Valmar!  Jermasoy: Still no sight of them. I don't know what they're doing, but they only got 2 minutes left.  Jermasoy: One minute! Necronz: Come on. Come on. Please.  Jakubovics: Book them.  Jermasoy: They took the poster. I don't believe it.  Pisylvania: It was meant to be. Valmar. That door will take you to the playground. [to Commi Sausages] You'll know which door. Hurry, Commi Sausages.  Ok, so we weren't really going to set off the alarms. But we were going to steal the poster. Here is what actually happened:  Tuesday  Break time  - 10:30 Me and Dickybod meet outside whilst having something to eat. We finalise the operation plans. 10:43 - We make our way to our English room. 10:45 - We enter classroom building and head for english room. 10:45:30 - Dickybod stands at door, being a very good look-out, whilst I take a chair, stand on it and take the poster off the wall, along with the blue-tak. 10:46:30 - The poster has been put in my bag, Dickybod comes into the classroom. 10:46:50 - The first person enters the classroom, and notices nothing.  15:50 - The poster is taken out of my bag and straightened out.  15:50:30 - PC turned on. 15:53 - Picture placed in scanner, scanning proceeds. 16:00 - Scanning and saving finished. Later that night - Sent copy to Dickybod.   Thursday  07:30 - Poster folded and put into school bag. 10:30 - Me and Dickybod meet outside to discuss conclusion of operation. 10:43 - We make our way to English room. 10:45 - We enter classroom building and head for english room. 10:45:30 - Dickybod stands at door, being a very good look-out, whilst I take a chair, stand on it and put the poster back on the wall, with the Blue-tak.   OPERATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.  If you want a copy of the poster, contact me on MSN for details.  Did some practice biology and chemistry tests earlier today. Also have to learn a german presentation for oral exam in less than 2 weeks. Bugger.    Playing:  Tetris on Gameboy  Listening to:  Music collection on random  Watching:  Old Friends episodes earlier  Annoyed with:  German  Confused about : Biology  Mood:  Ok
