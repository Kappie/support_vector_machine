Get to sleep at around 11:15 every night, get up at 6:30. Repeat. Wake up, eat breakfast (staring out the window is optional), repeat. There's only 2 more days of this crap, and there won't be any homework assigned today or tommorow as its the last day of regular classes for us. That's one hell of a big plus. However, my mom was complaining about my grades last night. Yep, about MY grades-she never does that! And all it was was 2 B's, and one in Biology should be a B+! I could see that if I had a D or something, but for a B? forget it. And you know what? our parents couldn't do have as well as we do in our classes, and yet they still complain. pathetic.
