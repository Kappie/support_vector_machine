I haven't been able to log onto the internet because the internet is hooked with the cable company, and since they're such screw-ups down here it'll take another month or so for me to have cable, internet and a ground phone line. Once I'm up and running I'll be more active on this site and my own! Glad to see that Liz took some time to tell you guys that I'm still alive (thanks Liz!) Anyway, gotta run, at a new friends house! Bye all!   P.S. Andrew... you be good now.
