I for one, hate it, butI am forced to use it anyways since it is the only way my friends talk.  Pro: Easier to talk to people through it  Con: It makes you afraid to use the phone   Pro:Easier to say what you want  Con: 99% of the time it's either something perveted or something someone doesn't want to hear   Pro:You can be anonymous  Con: No one knows who you are   Pro:Better for making plans  Con: They have already made plans with 5 other people that night through AIM   Pro:you can block people you don't like  Con: Chances are they have 4 other screen names they can IM you on, and if they don't, they will make one because they think they are smart.   Pro: All you have to do is type your message and hit enter  Con: It makes idiots out of people, because they think that LOL, BRB, i, ROFLMAO, are real words. Get a Fucking life   Here is a typical profile of some  woe is me  girl who changes her info every 10 seconds because she thinks people read it.   An away message since people care that you are taking a shit (commonly known as  Around the house )  ______________________________________________-  -Some Poem that's too long for me to be bothered to read it  - Some copied and pasted message of a conversation with someone else, with them saying something about how cool that person is  -Song Lyrics to whatever song is popular on KissFM (the local bubblegum station)  - Something about how no one knows who they really are  -A quote from legally blonde or another gay girl movie  -Their cell phone number for people who need to call them right away  ___________  there it is, so IM me @BigJiffieMan
