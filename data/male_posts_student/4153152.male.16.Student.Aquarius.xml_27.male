Our fourth person was about 45 miles out of town, and he'd be here within an hour. Then this storm comes out. Out of nowhere, it's raining like crazy, with dime size hail. The hail let up after about 10 minutes, but the rain kept going. Our fourth (and neccessary) person had to pull over and wait out the rain, so he could see well enough to drive. This wouldn't bother me as much, but this same thing happened at last week's LAN party. Sudden rain, severe thunderstorm warning, and one fizzled LAN party. I guess there was a tornado warning this time.  The only major achievement I've made today is figuring out the remote console and remote admin functions for battlefield. And that's like a 20 minute job. Woo.  By the way, that house in the picture isn't mine.
