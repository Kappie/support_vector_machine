He doesn't add any, random visitors will come, and add their definitions of words.  It's similar to raisethefist.com in it's decentralized nature but without the redeeming values.  Granted, a white man has a right to own the site 'urban dictionary' and he even has the right to pronounce Kelis wrong (he used a soft 'i') and call her a rapper (since all black music is rap).  But he let's people post some serious trash, that he doesn't bother to delete.  I was more horrified when I found out that many people agreed with the persons definition.  So here is what I'm fuming about.  NAACP  National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  They do more harm than good.  Not everything has to be a racist issue.  "The NAACP is always causing problems,  this is why we have prejudice."   I seriously wonder why even bother fight for equality, when we could seriously just agree to not like each other if this is how things are going.  Even moreso, I know a person like that is anti-Affirmative Action.  This is why progress is next to impossible here in the US of A.
