Not only that, she became a bitch about how DPKT is run, and suggested that she'd tell Invision about this board so it would be deleted. Yeah...and she became a bitch about the forums AFTER she cheated on her boyfriend with me. And on top of that...she's an immature, incompetent dumbass.  As for Hikari...gee, where to start? She got into a lustful relationship with me by telling me that she loved me when she really didn't, and kept begging me to screw her everytime she posted. When she got mad at me about anything, she pretended to be her friend Caitlin so she could cuss me out. When I figured out it was Hikki (which was easy, since the real Caitlin told me it was Hikki all along), both Hikki and Caitlin denied that anything had ever happened. I KNOW THAT I WAS GETTING BITCHED AT, KTHX. I'M NOT THAT STUPID. I really don't care if she ever talks to me, since she's on her, what, second boyfriend since I broke up with her. Yeah...love forever my ass.
