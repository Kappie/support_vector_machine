Well, not really that, it's just that I tried playing some ball last night, and I was sore then, but then got into the groove and started running around like I was alright.  Woke up early as all heck this morning and found that being alright is far from the case w/ me.  My traps ( muscle between shoulders and neck)  hurt all good, and the legs, dang the legs are nice and sore like I just took that pack test again?  It's going to be a  loooooong  day for me.  The big thing today is those refresher things for fire fighting that goes on all day today.  Yesterday I turned in that physical stuff, but what do you know, they only wanted a copy of  one thing , but the packet they gave me was like  6  pages?   What's the rest for, looks ?  But, after all this running here and there, and the physical challenges now over w/, I'll finally be able to say, " yup, I'm on the ole waiting list now. "  Meaning:   I'm almost an official Emergency Fire Fighter .  I want to take my li'l nephew  Ray  to Spring Canyon today, but not sure if he's around here, or where he's @?  Actually, kinda wondering where he's staying since school is out?  He used to actually call up the house, " uncle, can I come over ?" and I was just too busy to spend time w/ li'l man.  Maybe I'm just feeling bad for brushing him off, but still, I want to spend time w/ him.  I  do not  really  like  the  heat , or the  sand , or the  people around , but I'm willing to bet if you show him the water, he's good to go no matter what.  Oh, and I lifted yesterday.   Bench  =  15 reps @ 135; 10 reps @ 225; 4 reps @ 295; 1 rep @ 315;  9 reps @ 255 .  Then, did some curls to finish my oh so busy day of lifting.  While leaving the community center though, saw my uncle  Clifford .  He's cool and all, but it saddens me to see him getting so small and frail.  Growing up he was the constant joker and kinda livened things up, but now though, he has years on his face and a look of worry in his eyes.  Maybe it's just me, but that's what I see whenever I get a chance meeting w/ him.  Even so, much respect is due to that man, so I do what I can for him.
