It reminds me of school. Also, it is a tedious wase of time on pointless busy work.  If there are any teachers reading this, DOWN WITH HOMEWORK!!! I think,on a none-uniform day, I will come to school in a t-shirt that says DOWN WITH HOMEWORK! That should get 'em!! Well, Ive got to write my PowerPoint Presentation to a CD-R so if you dont mind?...
