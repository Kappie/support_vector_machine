Again I was home alone, no matter-mum would be coming home in the afternoon.  Got dressed, breaky, etc. Then sat myself down and started writing the third post. I also logged on to MSN, and so I found that I spent the whole morning chatting on MSN to Max, You(N), and suprisingly Neil. He and I were arguing about many things beofre the telephone rang. "Hello". "Hey darling, it's mum". "Hi Mum, how are you going"? "I'm well, how are you"? "I'm doing ok". "I'm going to stay at Anna's house tonight, and Ellie is going to Lucy's place for the night". My day was set-it wasn't going to be good    It passed slowly. I had this essay for international studies that was on the effectiveness of the united nations. It took me an hour, then I had dinner. After that, back to msn. I had planned to talk to you two on msn at 8:30. HA! Yeah right...........  @ 8:15-chatting to Max, 8:45-Max goes to bed, 8:50-ring Em-she has to eat and will be on at 9:30.Forget it, i'm going to bed :(. 9:00-Natasha comes on "where is Em"?, 9:02- ring Em again "come on MSN". 9:05-phone rings- no doubt Em is canceling :| "Hello"? "Hey John, it's Matt"!   That was the best part of my day. I chatted to him for about ten minutes, and he really cheered me up from my depressed alone state. You know, he may be a yuppie at times, by Matt is a really sweet kind friend of mine, I think I was jelous of him for a while.  Anyway, got back to the computer and chatted to you two for a little while, you guys wern't very talkative, I got off MSN at 10:00, and went to bed depressed    John
