I was seriously lying in bed until 10 minutes ago.  I am begining to think my sleeping habits are becoming unhealthy...  anywho, here is the scoop. *harp sound*     ~*~   ~*~   ~*~     BUZZ, BUZZ, buzz, ....buzz... ... ...  "Hooray!  *snore*".  Finally, my damned alarm clock died on me.  I felt like dancing, well, no i didn't.  I felt like sleeping in.  So I slept, and slept, and slept.  But i woke up every hour to look at my watch and see what time it was.  and every time i did, i would say the same exact thing; "Shit, I have to get up... ... ... *snore*".  I couldn't believe that i did that 5 times.  I'm so ashamed :P  after about 5 hours of trying to get up, I stumble over to my drawing desk.  What do you think I would do at my drawing desk?  Draw, right?  wrong, i threw my head on the table and began to sleep.  this lasted for two more hours.  "huh, wha... ... (glances at watch)... ... I hate you alarm clock, why did you have to die today!".  I remember that i had to finish off a still-life drawing today to sell at the block party.  I had been drawing them for a week and have a total of 5.  I really hope i can make some money off of them, and get my name out there in the public.  This sort of interferes with my dream of being a rock star, but hey; artist, rock star, whats the difference.  So i finally stand up, go to the bathroom, and get into the possesed shower.  Yeah, that woke me up fairly quickly.  After spending a very unusually small amount of time in the shower, i go back to my drawing desk and try to work up the energy to finish the picture of the Diner with the old man out front.  But instead, i go over to my desk and turn on my laptop and begin to type this.  so as of now, i am just procrastinating.  and i will finish this later today.     To be Continued...     -Jim
