It's funny, I don't even know what to call what I write, I just refer to it as the writings.  I named my earlier works "The Art of Rambling" or AoR for short, so that's where the blog title comes from.  The book I write in is just some random 300 page A4 notebook on which I have pasted a biohazard symbol, not many of my friends bother to ask what I'm writing, when I don't respond they just assume its a journal of some sort. If you know me, kudos for finding this, and I hope that what I post here gives you a lovely insight to my mind, If you don't know me, feel free to comment.
