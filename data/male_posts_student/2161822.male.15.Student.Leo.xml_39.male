Joe is great. Don't let his rough exterior mislead you however. Beneath this rugged persona is the mind of a genious. Only to name a few accomplishments, he is the reknowned creator of the nickname "Lifeguard", a successful asset to the Hafey football team as a lineman, and has some mystical future-telling powers (he actually predicted when the bell was going to ring on a Thursday). These are but a few of Joseph's great life accomplishments. And who will ever forget his peace pipe-making skill. Joe truly has changed the world. And he will forever go down in the "I Am A Life Changing Person and I Am  GREAT " hall o' fame. And this my friends, is my tribute to the genious, the comedian, the loving man Joseph Kriesher the III.
