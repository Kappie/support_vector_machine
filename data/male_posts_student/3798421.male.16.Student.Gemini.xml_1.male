It is difficult on such a system to actually put down the honest and true thoughts that you have in the full realization that people can read it. It is odd how, because I know that almost literally anyone could find this blog if they tried hard enough, and in itself, that is scary. Wonder if some stalker is looking for me? One can never know. Of course, all of this is silly. Of course people can read it. I am sure people I know will read it. So what? Who the crap should not know my true thoughts and feelings. If what you tell them is otherwise, isn't that being truely and utterly fake? I don't want to be fake. So, thus begins the blog. Don't pretend that it will be updated as often as it should, or as regularly as it should. Just know that it will be updated when it needs to be, no more or no less. As this is my first one...                                  I'll clue you in to my life so far. You can read my profile for any personal info, age/sex/weight/hair color/eye color/IQ/BO/type of toenail fungus, etc, etc. Here I will tell you about my life. I live in NW Pennsylvania, drive a new bulletproof black Caddilac STS and have a personal assistant named Johnny. Ok, so, no...not really. I do live in Northwestern Pennsylvania, though! Actually, I don't come from a rich family at all...but we have it pretty good, roof over our heads, the last in a line of three children, a nice, seven car family. Someday I will tell you what all kind of cars we own. Not today. And tomorrow isn't looking too good either.  Now on to my lack of love life. I have had some trouble with the ladies...girls...females...opposite sex...whatever you want to call them. Their trouble. At least in my experience(s). See, as a family rule, I could not date until I was sixteen. Three weeks ago I turned the magic number. So, how could I have so much trouble with women before that? Actually, I stuck by the family name and did not disgrace us. I didn't date anyone before I was sixteen. At least, not officially. See, a fine line is drawn between being friends with someone and being more than friends. I wish I knew where that line was. In all reality, I know I have been more than friends with some girls. But with all girls, I have been less than their boyfriend. What is that gray called? Make up a name for it and put in the comments part. Anywhoo, as I have had nothing really worth my while happen between me and a girl (and if you are thinking physically, you are wrong and right in the same aspect). See, I have never done more than hold hands or hug a girl. So you are right that "nothing really worth my while happen between me and a girl" could mean that. But, it doesn't. I mean a connection of some sort. Something that says "I want to be with this girl for a very long time, whatever the cost". And, the thing is, I don't expect that to happen. I don't think it ever will. Some of you in the older crowd are probably crooning "Oh sonny, just wait until that special girl comes along, you'll change that tune". Well, no, I won't. Because I was born to be single. I have established that so far. And, being that I have established that, I have decided not even to waste precious time/effort/brainpower/etc on a close relationship with a female. I know it won't work out, so why try? It makes sense to me... And of course, there will be the doubters that say "Well, how can you judge when you have never had a kiss or a viable relationship?". Maybe I can't judge. But, watching from afar, (the best place to watch from), I have seen relationships fail, falter, get ruined. I have seen couples painfully split, get back together, split again, get into fights, make up, break up. It looks like it really sucks. So, I really don't want to be a part of it, therefore I plan on not dating until I am completely ready. Who knows when that will be? Maybe, one could hope, never.  Maybe I am just a bitter old man in a young kid's body. A hermit or monk of sorts. As I see it, maybe I just learned the secret way ahead of my time. Do you notice how, in history, monks have invented and thought a lot of powerful ideas and inventions? It is because they have time to think, and don't worry about silly things like romantic relationships. And out of all the romantic relationships in the world, how many have been helping civilization? Basically, one on one relationships are selfish. I want to really experience the world with open eyes, not through rose-colored glasses, and it would be difficult for me to do that when I can't see past another "special" person. So, out of the dating circle I go.  Don't be screwed up, either, in thinking I am gay or something retarded like that. I am extremely attracted to girls.  Like a moth to a flame.
