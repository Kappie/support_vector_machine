Welp, I'M BAAAAACK  It actually turns out I was wrong, people didn't cry, dancing was kept down to a minimum (honest ;)) and to my complete shock, there wasn't any snogging(that I could see anyway). The only real shitty thing about that night was that we didn't get a picture taken. Right, the deal was that when people got to the Oaklands, they would get out of their cars (or limos in many cases, grr) and have their photos taken, possibly for the local paper (big whoop!), and because we got there so early, the paper people hadn't even turned up yet. Ah well, knowing my luck, we wouldn't have even got in anyway.  I've started playing the Lottery, I feel like I'm being screwed. I've played twice, and I could have had 4 numbers on both. For example, I would pick 1, 11, 15 and 31, and the proper numbers would be 2, 12, 16 and 32. No fair, I should get paid for that right?  Started shaving too, rubbish.   Nothing to report since then, just repeating previous posts, such as blisters, why they suck ass, and why people should let me sleep.   SUPERCALIFRAGILISTICEXPIALLYFUCKINGDOCIOUS, haha, I spelt it :p Yeah, my darling brothers have played that song for like 4 days solid, and it's doing my head in.   Anyway, till next time...
