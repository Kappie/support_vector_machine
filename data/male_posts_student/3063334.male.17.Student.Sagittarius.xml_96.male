It's unfortunate we haven't had as much forced social contact since 8'th Grade Spanish, we sure had good times.  Anyway, I wasn't in class for English today, would anyone like to let me know what the "Spring Break Challenge" is?  It was mentioned on the syllabus, but haven't heard about it since.  Have great breaks everybody!  Love, Rob
