At school was great also as i got pinched alot from my teacher..but well that kinda sucks! loL ! Shes just teenage abusing me ! i also had the chance to listen to my discman..kind of fun as my teacher dont mind! haha it helps me study better also as i had a maths test today..It was A Killer..imagine doing it without a calcalator! but i still pulled through..haha..it was easy but without calculator means death..At the gym we had lotsa fun..doing sit-ups and challenging who could do most.. haha! 45 in one minute for me!!!  challenge me if you could!! nah jus kidding!! i would definately lose!..we played soccer after that also..did lots of move such as "The Scorpion"! it was really funny as we havent master it yet and we were like doing handstands all the time with the ball jammed between our legs..not right up there but at the ankles as scorpion moves needs you to execute these steps.. =P but we were failures! Tmr  is gonna be a great day i think...hope it would be fun..kinda sad and hurt too though...why....damn...im just so..sadd...hurt and depressed but ill wait..its just killing me...hope i can be with someone i love..
