I start work tommorow on my induction day. It'll show me what working theres going to be like. I'm looking forward till the first 2 weeks are up because their my trial period and if i dont impress them then i'm outta there, so i need to make a good impression. The bad thing about working there is that i get paid monthly. I was hoping at least fortnightly, but oh well at least i'm working.   So, when you have the money, what do you do with it?  If you dont spend it, then its gonna keep building up and up, which is a good thing but it gets to you when you know its there, and you wanna spend it, but for some reason you cant. Personally i'd love to have loads of money, as would other people, so i could buy all the things i wanted to. But if you did spend it, your not gonna have any savings for something big.    I've just paid off my dad for my new phone, which is great by the way! Its got video on it, which is kool. I've already got footage of my mom moaning, which i keep playing back to her. I've still gotta pay off my dad for my old phone. I did already buy it once, but i threw it at the wall which kinda smashed it into thousands of pieces. Wasnt all my fault though, my brother wanted it and i kept saying no but he wouldnt take that as an answer so i just threw it at the wall. At least he didnt get it!   Anyway, Wednesday night me, Martin, Joe, Firth and Sam went bowling (Ross made a brief appearance) and i wasnt planning on bowling. So i sat through the first game and decided i wanted to play the 2nd game with them. So i went up to the counter and she said that was OK so she done it. But when she told me the price i thought something was a bit strange. Martin told me to show her my NUS card, but she said it was too late. So i actually paid for the 2 games anyway, but i had to play one whole game on my own. Well i say it was one whole game on my own, but it was actually everyone bowling for 2 turns, all on me! What a rip off, what a con! But i was pleased that i beat the self proclaimed unbeatable Sam, which kinda made it worth the money. It wasnt even my money, i lent it from my brother and i thought i could of paid him back £4 out of the £5 he lent me and get the other pound another time, but i was left with £1.   I already knew it but i found out a couple of things about Sam.  1) He cant sit still for more than half an hour without throwing things and going silly.  2) He's a sore loser   Just to elaborate on that last one:  At Bowling he knew i was beating him after i got my second strike in a row, and when i got my third strike in a row, he tried to foul it so it wouldnt count therefore making him the winner. Then when the second game started he fouled it. But what goes around comes around, and Martin, Andrew and Ross (dunno where Joe was)all helped out to foul Sams go. That was one of the best things i've seen my friends do for me. Thanks guys. And no thanks to you Sam you stupid tw*t.   I think nows about the right time to do my 6th and 5th most irritating things:   6) Well i have to say this one: Sore losers : Basically this is just people that cant admit they lost, and they have to take it on on something or someone, or get their ownback on the person that whooped their ass.   5)  Football : I'm going to upset a lot of people here by saying this, but i just hate it. To me, its the same thing everytime a match is played. It doesnt seem very fun to me and i hate playing it, watching it and listening to other people talk about it. I'd like to think its an advantage to my future wife, because we all know that most women hate footie. And dont say i'm a woman, because i have male genitals to prove it, lol! If this top ten thing was in the order that they irritate me the most, then this one would be at number one!   4)  Racists/homophobics :To me,someone who has aphobia isscared of something, and they dont like to admit it. I dont like people saying their views out loud, just keep your mouth shut! And personally, i dont have a problem with either, so it doesnt bother me.   3)  Chaffas  - You gotta hate  chaffas/chavs/kevs  - whatever you wanna call em, their all the same at the end of the day, nickin' cars and tinkin' dat dey is 'ard by speakin' like day 'as got a speech impediment an addin' swear words in dwiv dere uvva words an smokin some crark.....innit man, innit!   (Note: I do realise that this may well in fact be a phobia, as in relation to number 4)        2)   Murderers, rapists, peedos, nuns, druggys,door todoor salespersons, conmen, loonies, vandals, theives - anything like that. I HATE them! Just lock em up or make em work for free, like making things that everyone needs, that way, prices will be lower because the person making them hasnt got to be paid. And we get to make their lives hell when they work for us as servants with shockers on their privates, like they have to others.   1)  Anything that irritates me in the future  - this is just a lazy number one, because i cant think of anything else. So if something irritates me in the future, then it goes here!   Hmm, i cant see how i came up with 6 other irritating things in one day (yes i did it today) but oh well, its out of the way.   Just to sum up the title of this masterpiece, i've actually had a haircut now, for those that give a crap- i dont know why i'm even writing this because i doubt anyone does - even i dont. Anyway, i've just had a normal hair cut. Looking at it now, i wish i had it justa bit longer because its a bit too short and it looks like Dale Wintons hairstyle, lol! Overall, cracking job with some regrets. I'm pleased its cut because i dont like it long because its too hard to manage (listen to me, i sound like a woman), and next time i'm keeping an inch or two on simply because the quiff is too gay, lol.  Have i even done a proper blog today? I dont think i have. Oh well, i wont lose any sleep over it, and i'm sure you wont either, so come back next friday, when i'll try and do a couple of topics to write about. If you'd like me to talk about something, then comment at the bottom of this box or email me -  urlLink grand_master_jebus@hotmail.com.....please !    So until then,
