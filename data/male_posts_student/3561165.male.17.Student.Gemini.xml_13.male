The cows are grazin', the beer is cold and my sharpshooter is goddang broke.My Dad wasn't too pleased about me calling him draconian and Bush-voting and stuff, so I rescind that. I don't think he'd vote for Bush on any issue except for all of them besides foreign policy! Anyway, sorry Dad. I had a fun time today, I was outside Home Depot (the poor man's home expo) and some Republican propagandafoo' asked me if I had registered to vote. Naturally, I took the opportunity to offload a good old "Hail to the thief, our commander-in-Chief!" and the imbecile decided to chime that my non-support of Bush shows me to somehow be uneducated ("little does he know" ~ my Stepmum"). If there are any fascists (i.e. Bush supporters) reading this I lay down the gauntlet for you to prove this guy right, and show us all how supporting Bushequates tererudition and vice verse. Anyway, that incident of Republican idiocyhumoured me, so I'm in a good mood.   I've been pissing around with an array of instruments from guitars, to pianos and so forth, which has been fun. I'm trying to write something with vibrancy, something that sounds fresh and interesting. I was at the home of a friend of my parents last night and I was watching music videos with their kids, who had a propensity for low-grade repetitious pop-crap. That stuff excoriates me, I can feel my flesh seethe as it cuts its way into my self. It motivates me to stand on my own two feet and do better, both in commercial terms (which seems to be the gauge of success in this revolting world)and primarily in artistic terms. I don't know if I can do better, but it would rile me if I could not do so. Anyway,I'm gonna apply for a job when I get back. Someday we'll meet again,don't know where don't know when, as they say in Albion. I can't be arsed to post much more on here, maybe my interest will be rekindled in a week or so.  Mood: Sombre Music: Some Lebanesereactionary-political singer. How dull.
