Later I annilated her with an oversized, inflatable bottle to the dismay of elder G and G shoppers. Payback's a muthafucka!   I am not a bitchwhore.   Well. I am the subject of a police investigation. Goodbye spotless record...But hey, at least I'm getting attention.   MC Ren sums up my feelings nicely in respect to recent events...Genius    "Fuck tha police and Ren said it with authority  because the niggaz on the street is a majority.  A gang, is with whoever I'm stepping  and the motherfuckin' weapon  is keppin a stash box, for the so-called law  wishin' Ren was a nigga that they never saw   Lights start flashin behind me  But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me  But that shit don't work, I just laugh  Because it gives em a hint not to step in my path   To the police I'm sayin fuck you punk  Readin my rights and shit, it's all junk  Pullin out a silly club, so you stand  With a fake assed badge and a gun in your hand   But take off the gun so you can see what's up  And we'll go at it punk, I'ma fuck you up   Make ya think I'm a kick your ass  But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast  I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime  But I'm a smoke em now, and not next time   Smoke any muthafucka that sweats me  Or any assho that threatens me  I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope  Takin out a cop or two, they can't cope with me   The muthafuckin villian that's mad  With potential to get bad as fuck  So I'm a turn it around  Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound  Ya, somethin like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat   Takin out a police would make my day  But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say."
