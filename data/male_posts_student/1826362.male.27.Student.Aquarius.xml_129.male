Both should be followed by a comma, just like the longhand versions of those phrases. misuse of the phrase "begging the question"  "to beg the question" means to assume as a premise the thing you are trying to prove.  Please don't use it when you mean "the question begs to be asked." misuse of "literally."  When you use the word "literally" you are saying that the phrase it modifies is to be taken in its literal, rather than in its metaphorical sense.  You cannot, e.g., say, "literally, he was ten feet tall," unless he really was ten feet tall.  This one really bothers me because I do it often when I'm not paying attention: using "your" when you mean "you're," or vise versa.  One is a possessive pronoun; one is a contraction of "you" and "are."
