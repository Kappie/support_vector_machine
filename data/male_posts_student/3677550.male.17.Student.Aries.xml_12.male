Fourthly (got this word meh? LOL), need to get myself tanned... now my skin colour looks like ah gua... haha... feel offended when pple say it... but i also noticed it's quite true lor... so no point blaming a person who's not distorting any facts... Fifth, try not toact stupid and laugh when i am too happy... sometimes i am disgusted by this also... but cannto help it mah... my own self... but i will try to kick this habit away... LASTLY, my height. 170cm... very short for a guy... but i know this one i can't do anything about it lar... genetic what... my mum merely 155cm, my elderbro 171cm, my dad 170cm, it's almost impossible that i shoot up to 180+cm right? lol... yeah... these are ALL my long-term goals... i am hoping i won't give up halfway... i have to bold this day's blog up so i won't forget about it...
