With a little help lifting the cabinet upper-part on top of the actual tap; screwing it in - it's finished. It's really great. We got a big chair with it too, though I don't like it too awful much. That's fine with me, it's not mine anyway =-)  My sister also got to go to her first job for the first day! We've been trying to get her to go to work for a long time. After her friend suggested her for the job, she got a call the other day. We knew she had one that day straight after she came back, but her friend was going on vacation to Mexico from now until someday. (I think)  Anyway,I have to go eat. It's 9 and I should have eaten later. So..... bye, see ya later. I'll have to do a better job of keeping up on posting in here.
