Irwin is the Crocodile Hunter of Animal Planet fame (Animal Planet is one of those cable channels that we pay for but don't watch.) His modus operandi is to annoy wild reptilian creatures until they snap at him in apparent disgust -- all of it caught on camera as he provides a play-by-play narration.   Recently Irwin has been at the receiving end of some serious criticism because he was seen on tape feeding food to a crocodile with one hand while holding his newborn child in the other. Some have compared his behavior to that of Michael Jackson who, in 2002, dangled his kid out of a hotel window. I'm not sure which is more potentially harmful: a known carnivore or a suspected pedophile. Seems like Irwin knows what he's doing where crocks are concerned though.  This Associated Press  urlLink story  says, "Some fans sent messages of support while others vowed never to watch his shows again." I think I'll go with the latter group but, in my case, I'll vow never to watch his shows for the first time either.
