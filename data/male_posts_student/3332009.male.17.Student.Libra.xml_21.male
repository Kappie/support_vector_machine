When we arrived there, we noticed that the clouds was turning black and that it was going to rain. We had only played for 20 min when it started raining. We seek shelter under some flats. The rain started to reduce so we decided to continue playing as long as there was no lightning. From than on we played a few games until around 2.  I was quite please with my performance. I was the captain of my side. I scored a few beauties.  I felt quite tired and my backside is quite pain as i fell down. It was a quite funny incident. Such a tall guy like me falling down. Even Zul fell down. It was so funny the way he fell.   After that we all went to eat at AMK and I went home after that I spent the rest of my day listening to music and surfing the net. I keep on changing the songs in my mp3 player.
