Stella's Birthday's coming up, hmmm, but its just her birthday for this month, so it'll be pretty light i guess, I feel like eating seoul garden again lol........hmm, i shall talk about my week. This week so far has been pretty light, or maybe its like the calm before the storm. I have been reading two books lately.  God is Dead: Secularization In The West  and  How we believe: The search for God in an age of science . The former talks about religion, and the latter focuses more on God in a theistic sense, God in general. The latter has really got me thinking about creationism and evolution, I may post my hypothesis on that here sometime.  Hmmmmm, musically, I've been getting alot into jap and chinese stuff. I think its good, sometimes we get too sucked into the crappy American corporate machine and start to lose our asian identity.  I'm currently listening to Ayumi Hamasaki's Surreal, I love her songs really, it gives a very ethereal, surreal, melancholic feel to it. Very artistic imo, I love Japanese artists, their guitarists are pretty kickass too, go see Ayumi Live, and whoa..........the guitarist can really improvise.........and her live concerts have a string quartet instead of a pre-recorded loop playing on CD, which many artists nowadays do.Asian artists imo, really deserve respect esp. in the international arena. True, there's some crap circulating in the Asian pop world, but a bulk of it really deserves our respect. Unlike in the US, Linkin Park as well as many other rock bands. I mean, Ayumi is not even classified as "rock" but her guitarist, drummist, keyboardist are all kickass.   I hope that the band with Me, han and Ben will really progress, I'm thinking of moving more in the songwriter school of music and then into the Prog school. And then hopefully fuse them both together. Cos' somehow, I can see potential in our band, due to our diverse influences and we have been basically untouched by the evils of modern rock. We can't jam lately due to school and all, but maybe in June we'll prolly get together and then get some things going. Hopefully, Chin Han would be able to contribute in songwriting. Hmmm, ok..........yeah that's it for today......
