Im also going to spend alot of time working on my business, right now i have a wholesale pallet bid on 81 shelter tents to sell on eBay, hopefully that works out. Thanks for reading this site, i know its been crappy sometimes and my life has been up and down the past little while but i appreciate everyone that reads it. If theres 1 person that gets something out of my blog then thats all i care about, i could care less if i get 200 visitors a day or even 1,000 a day. The blog is more for me than anyone else, so if you get anything out of it then great job!
