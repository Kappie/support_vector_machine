Ice Lemon Tea! AHHH! My ILT!   Okay. We went to bowl. There're me, CQ, Joyce, Gloria, SL, KS, ChiYuan and TZ. Yeah. HM, Janet, ShinHan and Kent Kent came later. Yeah.  Okay. We played three rounds. I got real tired after that, not to mention my hand was aching. Okay. The first round was terrible, as my balls keep cleaning the gutter. Towards the end, I striked! YaY! The second game I did quite well, though I started to stumble at the end. The last one leh, I was pretty average. I was getting real tired and sian le. Yeah. You can actually plot a graph. The graph slowly goes up..then with a very steep slope, it shoots to the top, then stables for a while (but rising). When it reaches the peak, it started falling, but not too drastically. Yeah. I am so bo liao right?  SL and Joyce went off first. We went to the foodcourt to eat. Ayioh....Gloria go and tell everyone I cannot eat this, cannot eat that. I must talk to her about this. Everyone went to the foodcourt because of me la. I ate chicken with centuary egg porridge. Firstly, it is HORRIBLE! Ginger slices were added, and you won't believe the horrendous amount! I thought they only add ginger in fish porridges to get rid of the yu xin wei (well, for me right, the yu xin wei is normal to me lor. There is no 'smell' people are prone to complain about. Ginger in porridges spoil the entire porridge due to its disgusting taste...I prefer fish and FISH ONLY). How dare they add that in my meat porridge!! I have to take the drastic route. It made me seem like a crass little cat, but I have to do it for the sake of my sanity! Whenever I chance upon a slice, I would pick it up. Long fingernails really come in handy! Heh Heh!   Okay. After that, we went down to look for SL and Joyce, fitting SL's glasses. We waityed for awhile, then went off! My wallet broke!! Ahhh!! How!!   We took 960 back. Me, Janet, Gloria and KentKent orignally planned to walkback home, but alas! It was raining! We decided to go to Causeway Point to escape the rain, while the guys are shopping. (Actually, me and CQ are not very socialable with the guys. We prefer to hang out with the girls. Like when hanging around with the guys I feel very awkward. All they talk about does not interest me at all. I am not the typical male lor. I feel more natural with the girls. Yeah... meow!) We saw the guys when coming down from Level 2, and we hid ourselves. HaHa!   Yeah. After some drinks-buying, we went back home lor. Once reaching home, I immediately went out to eat, in order to watch 8 Simple Rules. After watching that, I went to bath and came online.  Yeah. At 8, me and Father went to Woodlands Central to buy my wallet! Alas! The shop was closed, and the other shops didn't sell any wallet that I like. We went back home, and I suffered two mosquito bites! Ahhh! What nasty creatures!    Sunday : The Next Day   Hmm! What a touching Huan Zhu Ge Ge episode again! I am crying and crying, and is forever crying at HZGG! I did my chinese book review on them. Really! I went to borrow the books! I finished with one today, and is currently reading another! What a nice book!  Hmm. I also did my Maths homework. That uncute Tham is such a killer.   YaY! My parents brought me a new wallet (same brand and design, Polo Genuine) and a Discman! YaY! A Discman with remote contorl, can play MP3s.. Cheh, you all think. I love my Discman! Meow!! What a slim, sleek, black Discman!   Eee! I have to cut my fingernails for that Discman de leh! My fingernail have been left alone for 4+ months! Espeically my  left thumb! Such a beautiful long nail! Of course I saved it la. JiaHao will gloat over it! Ahh! My nail!  YaY! I will have my ATM Card! There's a little thief in my house! That stupid brother. Think I dunnoe issit? My safe's position was shifted, my parents said they didn't touch it. My money pile seems to be lower. It was lower! I didn't have so little money left! He stole from me because he can't steal from my parents anymore, when they found out their money was dissappearing and he was the top suspect. We even found concrete evidence, but he kept denying. Now, I am recording every deposit and withdrawal I made to my safe! For extra safety precaution, I am depositing every $20 I saved in my bank, and applying for an ATM Card, so I can deposit and withdrawl at my whim. Heh! I really hate thieves! My money!!! Don't ever let me catch him stealing..or else he will shi te bu hao kan!  Okay. I go sleep liao. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog! (2 minutes to spare till midnight! HaHa!)
