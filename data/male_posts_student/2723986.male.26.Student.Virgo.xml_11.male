I did get my amazon.com shipment (from my GameFAQs ROTM winnings) on Monday, so that was pretty cool.  The package contained:  -  Beyond Good and Evil  (Xbox) - GMK Godzilla (DVD) - Ultimate History of Videogames (book) - Opening the Xbox (book)  The Godzilla movie is fantastic – it’s easily the biggest budget Gojira movie that I have ever seen.  The editing, camera work, acting, effects and everything else is just so much more polished than I am used to getting from a giant kaiju movie.  Much props to Toho for hiring such skilled people to handle the film.    Godzilla is definitely portrayed as an evil entity, with his cloudy, pupil-less eyes and ruthless attitude, and that does take a little getting used to.  He has been a bad guy before in movies like the original Godzilla and Godzilla 1984, but here you aren’t persuaded to give him even an ounce of sympathy.  Also, King Ghidorah is actually a  good  guy, and helps Baragon and Mothra defend Japan from the big guy’s onslaught.    Like I said before, the editing is top notch and all the fighting scenes came out smashingly (heh).  A perfect mix of CG effects and traditional model/rubber suit work was employed during the brawls and everything looks just great.  Mothra and Ghidorah can now be seen flying realistically through the skies, with organic looking wings and all, due to the new use of computer graphics.  And man, does Godzilla know how to fight in the movie!  In one scene he is dealing with Ghidorah and Mothra tries to fly up behind him for a surprise attack.  We see Godzilla’s eyes shift to the side as he perceives the incoming danger and he quickly whips his tail up to take out Mothra without ever looking.  It sound pretty tame, but the way it was edited and filmed makes it a classic G moment.  Now I’m excited to see how the other two new Godzilla movies turned out, especially Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla.  Maybe I’ll win ROTM for January so I can get it from amazon.com.  Hey, could happen…
