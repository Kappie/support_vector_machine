It was nearly two and a half hours ago, but I'm still trembling slightly. Perhaps I should go back to bed. Hmm.  My mate Andy came online on MSN last night after having disappeared for several weeks to Cornwall, and he was quite severely drunk. He'd drunk either a pint or a litre of malibu (can't remember which). And there are few things funnier than the results of a drunk person typing. His attempt at spelling "thought" "thouyyoug" nearly sent me off my chair. I'm kicking myself for not saving the convo so I could post it here.  Another interesting thing- I'm taking a pretty girl to the cinema on wednesday. This sort of thing doesn't normally happen to me, so I'm reasonably overjoyed about this. I won't name her here right now, as people who actually know me might get a bit surprised. If anything comes of it I might name her on wednesday (or thursday, or whenever I blog after going).  Oh, and a catchphrase for today- "shit doesn't happen, it's a fucking noun!".
