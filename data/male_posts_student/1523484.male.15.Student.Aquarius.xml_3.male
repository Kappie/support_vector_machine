I wish to use this blog for my graduation project as it requires some sort of log of what I have done throughout the course of time between that of which I have started working on it, and the time I've finished working on it. It is really an excellent way to keep track of things as certain items can be identified by titles, the date and time are kept with each post, and it's really handy to update.    As of right now, all we, that is, Donny George, my partner for this project, and myself have done are our reasons for choosing this type of project, et cetera. We plan to, in the near future, decide upon the location of the rehearsal and the taping and the people in which to operate the camera, host the show, participate in the games, and play the music. We also plan on drawing up designs for the set, which can easily be posted here, and gathering the man power and materials for the job. We will most likely acquire help from my father, an accomplished carpernter, and any others who wish to lend their hand. All will be properly credited via the credits that will follow the programs ending. Other things need deciding upon, I'm sure, so I'll be sure to mention them and our progress in future posts.
