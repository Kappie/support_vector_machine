The whole week, needless to say has been about a series of equations, reactions, derivations, weird mechanisms involving a salamander's and cockroach's nutrition intake and digestive system respectively. It has ofcourse, also been about my classmates and I endlessly ranting about how 'we wished we could lay our hands on that idiot Gauss who couldnt mind his own business and had to go around making laws about electric flux; and that moron who invented integration' and blah blah but then, thats really pretty normal; I can't, technically speaking call it exam paranoia. What I infer about 12th std till now is that the major thing for you to do is to write tests.Class tests, cumulative tests, tuition tests, unit tests...you would think they would atleast run out of names or something but they just keep experiencing brilliance and when they run out of suitable prefixes for 'tests' they just replace the word tests with exams and voila my life is about 50 times more miserable!!  So obviously my room is in a complete state of chaos. All the people I know (for eg:relatives, friends blah) have this tendency of giving me their old books right after they are done with their academic year. They tell me that they have only ''my best interests at heart'' but I KNOW BETTER there's no room for thrash in my room, you dope; so you take it! is what they are really thinking.   I've been listening to the beatles and stuff and honestly some of their stuff's really good!I mean half the time people are just discrediting them because they are supposed to be likethe jhang jhang types and not the pukka fundoo rock that is ''in'' these days. Butits like real nice and acoustic; atleast some of their stuff is and hell they've about a gazillion albums! If all of them turned out rightI would probably get scared and chuck listening to them!The best part is that my dads always liked them and all so I would've heard most of the tapes that I'm listening to (voluntarily) now. I love it when stuff like that happens, like you think that you are going to listen to a song for the first time but you find that you already know the words and the tune and stuff and its even better if you end up liking the music! Currently theres this song called blackbird on. Here are some of the words:  Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these broken wings and learn to fly All your life You were only waiting for this moment to arise. Blackbird singing in the dead of night Take these sunken eyes and learn to see All your life  You were only waiting for this moment to be free. Blackbird fly  Blackbird fly Into the light of the dark black night.  Ah how could I forget; I still havent come to the sob story part!( general message: that means that the parts till now dont categorize as sob storyish. Right ho! just making things a little clear for the uninitiated). Those cable tv maddy geese have gone on some strike or something so no cable tv and to think Ihad been nurturing hopes of seeing atleast the news( talking about desperation,I wonder how my friends from school manage...they have only dd1 now that would classify as UNDILUTED TORTURE!!)on my two-week-something old tv which I haven't experienced whole heartedly yet.  The phone's dead as well. The only thing that is left is the power supply but then it had its share of (F*****) cuts all through my goddamn tests.   All this activation of unused energy has made me hungry so I'll go now...sit around listen to the beatles and go speak sweet words to my mum so she'll fix me a snack.
