The only interesting thing that happened today was I went over to Austin's house earlier and we watched "Scary Movie 3" and damn that movie is funny lol. Then we wrote my song that I made up on his computer and I think it is pretty good....but thats just me. Tomorrow the only good thing thats gonna happen is that I am gonna spend the night at his house. We are probably going to be up all night writing music and jamming which will be cool. But after going to his house I know what I want for my birthday lol. I want this affects pedal he has...it totally rocks balls dude. I played my lil guitar solo on it using the wah wah and I was like holy shit! Well I will try to post tomorrow on this day of sadness....I wish I could like spend some time with her after school but that aint happenin....bye y'all.
