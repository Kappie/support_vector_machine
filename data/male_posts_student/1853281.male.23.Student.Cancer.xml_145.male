It is much better to daydream about them daydreaming about you then to be struck in the face with the cold reality. His e-mail was short, chatty, upbeat, and utterly soulless. The type one would send to a highschool friend who contacts you out of the blue. Doesn't make me sad, but...hmmm...doesn't make me really angry either, it feels like a total cop-out, especially since this was one of the many without closure. I sure do know how to pick 'em. I repeat my mantra....Boys are Dumb( I am incuding me in that) Speaking of. J.C. was supposed to take me out last weekend, but mixed up a work thing and couldn't but was all chatty and complimenting me and flirtatious and saying how he had to make it up sometime this week, and now has fallen off the face of the planet. Again!! Did not go out last night, just sat on my porch, chain smoking, reading, and glaring at the block-party. Because of the rain on tuesday they had it last ngiht and the whole street was full of community, children, puppies, good intentions, and involvement. Needless to say it put me in a foul mood, but didn't want to pub or coffee shop it either...tried to frind a friend to rescue me but everyone was gone. it is times like that when i feel that the rapture has happened and i am in hell. skittles
