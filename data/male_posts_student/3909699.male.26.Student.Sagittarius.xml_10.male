Except for the   urlLink ANU , every university I have been to in Australia does this. No university I have been to in England ever has, but somehow I really managed to assume that I would be able to use the internet here. I think this might be like the hair thing. I now have two dilemmas: 1. Ellen probably thinks I am dead and/or an arsehole; 2. I have to register for a conference by tomorrow but cannot get the registration details. I will obviously have to go to town however it is now too late too realistically get to town before the banks close to make my conference payment, plus Ellen will probably be in bed by the time I send one, so I might just stay here and relax after my insanely long journey and perhaps call my mum later and get her to text Ells on my behalf.
