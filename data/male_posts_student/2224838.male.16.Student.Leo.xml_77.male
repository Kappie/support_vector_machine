I like to say that I'm Irish because I have partial Irish ancestory, and Ireland has always seemed cool to me for some reason. So, for today, I'm full Irish.  Since it's St. Patrick's day I thought I would show everyone some Irish phrases (mostly insults) that I found. Make sure to go around all day insulting people with these.
