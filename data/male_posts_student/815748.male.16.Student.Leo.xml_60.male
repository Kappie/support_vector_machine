Sully told me to recently (Jsun 102 (5:46:58 PM): you've really been neglecting that blog of yours), and I was trying to procrastinate from studying for the stoichiometry quiz, so here goes:  I finally finished (and started) my Malcolm X project; I made like 20 different buildings from his life that were supposed to represent "stepping stones."  She could tell I put a lot of time into it, but I don't think she liked it... right afterward, she said to the class, "By the way, you don't have to discuss the entire plot, just a few major turning points," and I'm like "Have mercy..."  The others'... meh.  I know most of you aren't in my English class, but I'll tell you, I didn't find most all of them interesting.  Plus a few were slackers, but they were girls, so they'll obviously get As.  Ummmm.... what else....  Oh, I saw "Revolutions," it was as good as expected.  And Tupac.  That was kind of boring.  (Though I'm still a gangsta, yo.  East siiide!)  I think I might take the Martin Rotemberg approach to Mock Trials, running off for many roles.  Well, at least two.  Definitely Palmer.  Ian is so annoying.  First he refused to even look at my resolution at like 9:30 two nights ago (file-transfer), then he burned it in chemistry the next day.  Then he shook it to get the flame out, and some of the ashes barely missed the wooden table.  Read over your safety contract, Ian... you're not especially encouraged to play with fire...  I was talking to Loren at lunch the other day about the expression: "Oooohhh! Shot down!" and I noticed that you'd never use it literally... Like at a crime scene, and the detective asks, "What happened here?" and the coroner says "Ooooohhh! Shot down! By a .45!"  Anyway, the closing thing for today is a tie between Biggie and Mock Trials quotes, so here are both:  Check it, I grew up a feckin' screw up, got introduced to the game, got a ounce, and feckin' blew up. Choppin' rocks overnight. The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin' to turn into the black Frank White. We had to grow dreads to change our description. Two cops on the milkbox missin'. Runnin' from the police, picture that, nigga I'm too fat. I feck around and catch a asthma attack. But still I bust back, it don't phase me. When he drops, take his glock, and I'm Swayze. Summer break, my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight. Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfecker.  And now, for Mock Trials:  "There were more than one conclusions drawn." --- (Get ready for) Gaby  "A teacherly assigned assignment..." --- Luba  And finally, words of wisdom from my math teacher, Mr. Stanley:  "I'm gonna fool around and see if I get lucky."
