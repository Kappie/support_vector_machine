THere has yet to be a week in which I haven't pulled an all nighter and last week I pulled 3, 2 of them right in a row.  Yes, I didn't sleep wed or thurs night and then I had to go to work fri night so I basically had like 2 hours of sleep from wed till sat about 1:00am...  Thats ok though my body has learned to adjust and I did well in all my classes.  My school is going surprisingly well for how much I miss class and slack.  Hopefully I will pull somewhere around a 3.0-3.5, no gaurantees thoug because there is stil alot of work though.  I got my next semester's schedual pretty mcuh done and hoepfuly it will be very easy aned put me on the road to graduation.  (I know this is the point wher you insert the Tommy Boy quote about Dr.'s going to school for 7 years, but at least I'm not still at Jr. College)  Last week amidst my lack of sleep I hadd the joy of seeing Willie Neslon in Topeka which did surround me with all the grey hairs in town but it was still a hell of a show.  Found a new Wilie song that I love (Me and Paul, funny cuz I lived with Paul last year).  I also have been having and loving life as usual so there is no complaints there.  Just finally learning how to fuck around in school and still do well.   A lesson learned late is better than no lesson at all. Hoepfully there will be more updates about m life more often but if I keep not sleeping like has been the norm lately I can't promise anything.  Peace out homies.  Song:  Joe Firstman - Saving all the Love (Great singer Songwriter, Check him out!)  Book: Anything assigned by my teahcers, Usually my Rhetoric book but hey who has time for fun reading anyway.
