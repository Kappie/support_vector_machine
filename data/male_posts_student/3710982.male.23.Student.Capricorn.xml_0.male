Everyone looks forward to summer as some mythical period in time where everything grand and perfect. Fuck that. [Although I do admit I like being in t-shirts and enjoy seeing the skimpy clothing on women.] But let's break down the summer for 99% of us. You fucking work all summer. It sucks. And you're probably tired when you get home. People don't go out during the week like they did before. You don't see nearly as many people. I'm pretty fucking sure I don't meet anyone new. So I decided I don't really need a job that badly in summer because I'm moving away to teach English in Korea. [Which by the way is a lot of work just to apply] I figured it'd be fun chillin all day doing nothing. It fucking sucks. Not only am I broke, but I can't even sleep in without someone waking my ass up. What do I do all day? Well I go online for a few hours. But let's be honest who spends more than 2 consecutive hours online wihtout getting extremely bored. It sucks. There is nothing new anymore to search, and if there I've already done all I'm gonna do with it before noon. No body is around to entertain me. You'd think I'd look forward to 5 when people get off work. Well they are tired from working. There are no good tv shows on anymore. All summer shit now. Reruns and junk. Summer is supposed to be blockbusters and tons of movies. So far it's sucked. I've seen Dodgeball ( meh not that good), around the world in 80 days (sucked)and Kill Bill2 (sick). In the summer it gets so hot sometimes that it's unbearable. Everyone gets the august blues when you want to get back to school and shit. But since I've graudated I miss school already. Well  a lot of you may say get a hobby or read a book. Fuck you - school was my hobby and I was required to read there.  Send me back to first year please.
