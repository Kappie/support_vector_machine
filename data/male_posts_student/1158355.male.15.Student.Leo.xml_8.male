Pat pretending to be all like... "TELL US WHERE HE IS, OK YOU WONT TELL, YOUR GONNA PAY!". We all went to my house... when I mean WE I mean THE GANG. Duh Duh DUUUHHH! We had a huge gang fight in my room and recorded it. I forgot to tell you all yesterday I got so excited I punched my desk and the draw flew off... and in health, James Buchmann wore make up and I captured it on A CAMERA! Ok... back to today, I went to the movies with Amanda, Toni, Amanda's friend Genna, Paul, Matt, Andrew C and JJ... oh ya Amanda's sister also. Cool Night. I Love You Amanda!
