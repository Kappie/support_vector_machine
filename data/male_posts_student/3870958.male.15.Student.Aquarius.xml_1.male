First i downloaded the Java Software development kit (SDK) from here:  urlLink http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download-netbeans.html  which comes bundled with a few other things and installed the kit. to actually find out what to do i'm, at the mo, using this URL, which is very clear, very well-written and i'm sure will help anyone wanting to learn how to program: urlLink http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/ . Also can i just say that no previous experience is needed but relatively average IT competence would come in useful. u'll get accustomed to the terminology and everything pretty soon if ur enthusiastic enough and ready to read
