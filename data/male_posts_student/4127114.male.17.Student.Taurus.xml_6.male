Lol, something I always used to say when reading my mate's blogs was that it's crazy the way names of  us  can be on the famoso internet! This inevitably entailed me saying to Zoe etc all. the. time. "Mention me! Say Sam said something about this or that!" Which is desperate, sad and star-seeking. Mneh, I cannae be arsed to be ashamed after the day I've had.      Federico and Riccardo, my darling but wearing Italian cousins, are obsessed with me and Tom's fashion, cos although Italy is wicked fashion, they have shit shops compared to Cheltenham, and I knew they would go spastic with joy at somewhere like Legends shorty, which would be great - if it wasn't a bleeding GIRLS ONLY shop now. But we located boys kids clothes in the boardy thingy legends. Nothing,  nothing  was right, which was dissapointing, seeing as I'd painted shopping here out as a orgasmic experience, esp. for skatey clothes. Mneh.      Then they don't have GAP near where they live, so we took them to it - and - like Legends - the sale shelves were *just* cleared, the shopfloor had basically nothing left, Federico and Riccardo didn't like anything I liked, Span (Cooper),   funny girl I know from school, wasn't there, cos she was in crete (altho Joe Luxton was working in Menswear, so we talked to him instead).       And nothing in freespirit, Cult actually  staggeringly  expensive, Burton boring, and so on and so forth, ad infinitum. But we bumped into Haz, who left Pate's last year when I wasn't there, but know through Sophie W, and Grace, Joe, Jenny H was in shortys, but looked to be in a pissy, so we avoided her ;).       AND I got a shit, chavvy haircut by a chav lady whose hair was so worrying that I felt physically sick to experience her hands touching my scalp, :(. Although it's partly my fault, for stepping into Tewkesbury the dump. Although we were looking around, and since spring it seems kinda on the up? But I still haven't forgiven chav lady for that cut. And I had to walk round Cheltenham, seeing everyone I know from school (see above) with hair sticking to my neck and my cousins imploding with frustration...      BUT. After a dire week of weather, weather is better - sunny even!      Smiles, with a half-full cup.      Currently listening to: Razorlight album. Starnge but good.
