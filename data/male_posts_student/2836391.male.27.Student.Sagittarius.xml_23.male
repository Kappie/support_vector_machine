On Saturday night alone there were over 100 first time commitments, and that was just a sample of God's work over the weekend. I found myself really challenged, encouraged, and touched by the Holy Spirit, more about that later. In short though, my commitment to the young people of my church has just sky-rocketed!! Praise God
