John Kerry picked a running mate and announced it on the internet first.  It’s John Edwards in case some one doesn’t know and /or cares.  First pictures from Titan have returned and are giving scientist a knock on the head. They are opposite of everything they expected. I don’t really care, but I know kris did, so here’s a link.  urlLink here   More unusual animal behavior. Cephalopods around the world a migrating towards fresh water. I don’t know why I didn’t see this one, it’s been there for a while, I am speaking of the panther attacks in Mexico.  Another mysterious scientist death. I thought this was just some weird conspiracy theory, but it seems to be perpetuating its self. A microbiologist in Houston was run down by an unmarked SUV on the sidewalk Sunday. If you haven’t heard of it, it seems that many scientists world wide that have an expertise in microbiology and/or diseases seem to be dieing of some what suspicious causes in the last two or three weeks. A 40 year old in Africs had a heart attack, a 46 year old had a stroke in London, Ect.    *Prediction* I have made the realization that everywhere there has been a ufo siting recently, there is also an animal acting strangly. Louisiana, the pelicans migration paterns are diffrent, Mexico, the Panthers... duh! and the squid near europe and several other areas in the US and Africa. I don't know whats happening, or what it concernes, but I think somethings up, wheather or not we find out about it later. This makes this prediction difficult to check, but I give it an 8.
