It rained last night (I could hear it before I fell asleep). I am actually not in my blue or grey sweatshirt (for those of you who never see me, I am always in one of those). I am in a red sweatshirt that most of you guys have never seen.   I started playing two games this weekend. I am getting fed up (not to the point where I would get rid of)  FFTA (Final Fantasy Tactics Advance; I beat it a few weeks ago). I started playing this Mario RPG game for the Super Nintendo. I have already beaten it once, but it is nice to return to old classics. I also started playing Paper Mario for the Nintendo 64. Again, I have beaten that, but it's an awesome game. Both of those are RPGs and Paper Mario copies off the first Mario RPG. I played both of those for like 3 hours last night. I plan on playing them when I get home today, hopefully, if I have no homework, and I am not over at the Jennings, or talking on the phone, or talking on the phone while doing my homework over at the Jennings. Anyways, I am extremely bored this NoRemember morning (read Piers Anthony's visual guide to Xanth. He decides to mess with the months).   *YAWN* I think I will be done for a little while, unless my dad is still out in the living room reading the paper. I like being in there alone so I can play my GameBoy in peace. Yet, he is still there. Now he is talking with my brother, or I think it's my brother. They both have real loud voices, so they always wake me up in the mornings. I am really unlike anyone else in my family. Derek is like my dad. Chris is like Chris. I am pretty close to my mom in our actions and reactions, but I still think I am different. I think my dad should take a shower pretty soon. It is 7:15 in the Ante Meridian (AM). I need to get off now, Derek wants to check his email. I will try to get done in web-page fast so I can add more. Maybe I will just write some more in Tech Assistant. Remember, the sky is the limit, unless you are in a spaceship.
