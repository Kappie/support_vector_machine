Wednesday: started on the most fun athletics-involved thing I've ever done in my whole life. I started the bike trip to Calvin.We made it to Kokomo the first day. Poor Jonny Sturmo hit a pedestrian on the monon trail. Old lady broke her arm! We stayed at the Kokomo RP church. Next day was to Nappanee. Coolest youth room Ive ever seen where we stayed at. You would have had to be there. yesterday, we went to Kalamazoo. and today made it to Calvin. I could go on, but there is other stuff to do here, so thats it for now.  "Duuuuuhhhhh....no." or other "duuuuuuhhhhh...whatever" from Nathan Dart about dumb things on the trip.
