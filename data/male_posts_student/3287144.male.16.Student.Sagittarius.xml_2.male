Which I do, even if I am a day behind...  Anyway as today [yesterday] is [was] a Saturday I thought I deserved a lie in but eventually decided that it might be nice to be awake in time for lunch and I was just having a shave when I heard a knock at the door which told me that lunch was ready and there were a plate of spring rolls outside if I wanted them.  What is the point? People will do this to me all of the time, see I am busy and interrupt me with stuff; do I want to eat spring rolls while shaving? No. I'm holding a sandwich with a receipt in one hand while trying to put money in my wallet with the other; do I look like I need to be served? No. I'm reading a book; do I want someone to turn the lights off to save energy? No. I could continue on with this stream of stupidity but I won't and instead say this; if you ever meet me, whoever you may be, don't bother me with similar questions or actions!  Anyway before I do go to bed [which I really want to do] I wish you all good morning.  Good morning.  Music: Coldplay - Spies Mood: Dull Site:  urlLink http://www.neave.com
