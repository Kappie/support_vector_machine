Hmm, this New Year is filled with uncertainites. The outcome of SPM would determine the whole year course. Resolutions for 2004? Here's some.  1. Get rid of 'mim-alif-lam-sin' syndrome. (Sorry, I copied you  urlLink teacher !) 2. Stay girlfriendless so I can do thing on my own. (Yeeha!) 3. Organize my digital pictures and music. 4. Complete my many postponed projects. 5. Get my own domain for my blog!  Others? I'm thinking now and some are private so can't tell you all. Anyway, Happy New Year! May Allah fill this year with happiness.
