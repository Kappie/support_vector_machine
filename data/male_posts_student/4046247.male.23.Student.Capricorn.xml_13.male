Greetings to all of you from Panama, land of the Isthmus and the Canal.       Panama is distinct from other Latin American countries that I have visited, including what many call the ¨Switzerland of Latin America,¨ Costa Rica. The imprint of America´s long presence here lingers unmistakeably, particularly in the recently abandoned military bases near the Canal and in the nation´s currency, which is merely the dollar popularly renamed the BALBOA. The Canal itself is a testament to the ingenuity of French and American engineers, and a tribute to the hard work of Panamanians and immigrants from Guadeloupe, Jamaica, and Martinique. Indeed, it is a site to behold! Yesterday, I visited the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks, and saw the enormous container ships, all built so as not to exceed the PANAMAX width specifications, slowly be raised or lowered, to either the levels of Lago Gatun or of the Pacific Ocean. I had dinner at a restaurant overlooking the Miraflores Locks.      Panama is surely a twilight zone, a way station that barely divides the waters. For a span of 80 kilometers, enormous ships that normally have the run of the oceans must squeeze slowly through humid jungle and the narrow Culebra Cut. The toll, assessed on a per ton basis, normally exceeds $30,000.
