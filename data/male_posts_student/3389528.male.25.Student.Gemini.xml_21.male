But on a lighter note, the session rocked and my campers were awesome.  They will be truly missed.  I did get a little emotional seeing them go.  No tears, but plenty of emotions.   I bought 2 new books last night.  This makes me very happy.  Um.  Okay I'm not so inspired today.  Just kind of chilling.  Peace.
