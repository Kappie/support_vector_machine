I scrambled some egg with peppers, onion, cheese, and tomato and it tasted de-lic-ious!    I'm getting used to my new blogging program now.  Tis fun, tis fun!  We all watched a movie on the telly this evening after Corrie and here I am now whacked (again)  I'm begining to think there might be something wrong with me    I might go out and do most of the practical part of my Geography coursework tomorrow with the mates.  I'm off to bed now, I'm bloody tired.  Bye bye bye bye bye...
