One of the last century's most important philosophers, either  urlLink Theodor Adorno  or  urlLink Ian Svenonius , comments that the logic of late capitalism has led to the reification and subsequent fetishization of culture, and thence to a seemingly inevitable traffic in "cultural products".  This, Ted 'n' Ian go on to tell us, gave rise in the earlier part of the twentieth century to what has now become a barrage of fads, trends, and " urlLink the next big thing ".  The supposed "democratization" of culture, rather than opening the doors of art to the masses, has instead led to a situation in which entrepreneurs deal in music, literature, and the graphic and performing arts in a manner essentially indistinguishable from the trade in a commodity like petroleum or iron.  The record industry, in its ceaseless rush to supply the public demand for product, therefore mines the bars and nightclubs of the postindustrial West, and to a lesser extent  urlLink even farther afield , for an untapped vein it can present as the hot new thing or a reasonable facsimile thereof.  While the nature of the production of cultural goods means that the "artist" is necessarily complicit in at least a part of this process, and while this complicity often creates deep psychological conflicts for many producers of musical commodity, this is not the purview of this post.  Rather we concern ourselves here with discussing a mechanism for preventing the reification of musical culture.  Naturally, considering both the nature of the system in which we find ourselves and the human nature which has led to that system, we cannot hope to force the culture industry to suddenly surrender and reconfigure itself on a noncapitalist basis.  The way in which independent rock has typically dealt with this problem is to recede into a notional " urlLink underground " where presumably they are freer to act as  urlLink artists  rather than artisans.  This strategy is not watertight, as every once in a while a wave of artists from this so-called "underground" forsake it for the lure of wider acceptance, in the process giving the industry a new point of entry and a new spectrum of styles, stances, and  urlLink attitudes to market .  Nonetheless, in periods when the "underground" is allowed some measure of autonomous functioning, it serves as fertile ground for the interchange and development of ideas.  Adorno would argue that in promoting this kind of arrangement for what is essentially a popular art form, rock and roll to be explicit, we are falling victim to the kind of false connoisseurship that plagued popular jazz records in the forties and fifties, and overvaluing a process which is less creative than reproductive;  Adorno however was a fucking snob who thought jazz was inherently fascist.  In reality there is nothing more or less valid about a truly powerful work of rock and roll than a fucking kickass classical composition.  Naturally there are pitfalls:  just as classical music has its "fans" who participate willingly in the Cult of the Conductor, thereby fetishizing something essentially peripheral to the music, so does underground rock and roll have the obsessive collector, who MUST HAVE every  urlLink Sarah Records  7", not to listen to them mind you, but just to  have .  These are, like the collective behavior of the culture industry, merely acts of commodity fetishism not, as Adorno claims, more germane to any genre of music than any other, but instead growing out of a modern consumerist mentality into which all individuals in our society are liable to slip.  By "going underground", groups can attempt to escape the conversion of their popular art, which is something that is created and disseminated among people, into mass culture, which is created and perpetuated onto people by an artificial apparatus.  Part of the very attraction of independent music for its practicioners and fans is this element of disconnection from the culture at large, which is practically the sole purview of the culture industry.  The nature of the underground is to be fragmentary and disjointed.  Music is created and disseminated by groups and individuals who are committed to principles other than the saturation of the market with product, and therefore their reach is short and weak.  This means that within the supposedly unitary "underground" there are many different currents running simultaneously, often with absolutely no connection to one another.  This is why it is possible, at a good time, to keep finding new things worth hearing, as long as one makes the effort.  One salutary effect of this disjunction is the limitation it places on the ability of one style or attitude to monopolize the cultural space we have carved out for ourselves.  That is to say, more opportunities to say "your favorite band sucks and here's why" than can be found in the mainstream, where quality is quantified on the Billboard charts and there is no choice other than the one between "Rock" or "R".   I am fully fucking aware of the irony of making this claim in a bit about a subculture that's already made that very same choice;  think of it this way - the mainstream doesn't divide Rock down any farther.  Oh, sure, maybe it grades its rock by hardness or heaviness, but ultimately what the market does is select for the most reliably homogeneous body of music it can - what's unusual is risky, and risks don't sell.  This is why so-called "musical revolutions" in mass culture inevitably begin with a single leftfield success, blossom with the cooperation of the single leftfield success's friends, and result, sometimes as little as a year after the fact, in nothing more than a new chart hegemon.  If this were not the case, Nirvana, rather than killing off cock rock, would have coexisted alongside it;  we might even have been spared Candlebox.  However, as music (in the form of the "single" and the "album") and to a near-equal extent attitude are the commodity products of the music industry, it is in their interest to homogenize those products with respect to another as much as possible.  Quality is not as important as reliability.  Underground music, from hardcore punk rock to hip-hop, has no charts, and therefore no chart hegemons.  The indie press has its darlings from week to week or month to month, but the saturation of independent media is so weak, and the fragmentation of taste so profound, that even while we may get sick of fucking Joan of Arc already, you can bet that there's still someone out there, no less "punk" than you you little snob, who's just getting into them for the first time, and furthermore is probably able to dismiss your newfound appreciation for Los Crudos as too little too late (that fucking snob).  That's not to say that underground rock is free of the impulse to create a canon.  From time to time books like   urlLink Our Band Could Be Your Life   come along and attempt to enshrine a certain band or group of bands over the rest;  certain influences pop up again and again in interviews in zines.  However thanks to the weaker grip that underground musical culture has over its adherents, that canon is bound to be reorganized constantly as kids go back and revive the memories of bands and movements who have otherwise left no lasting trace.  It's a far cry from the mainstream media with its endless Beatles-Stones-Led Zep Beatles-Stones-Led Zep Beatles-Stones-Led Zep-oh-yeah-and-those-Sex-Pistol-dudes.  The absence of a canon and a powerful unitary organ of taste dissemination like MTV or Rolling Stone or Spin means that discovery of  urlLink new sounds  and scenes within the underground is largely up to the individual.  These musics must be actively sought out by the interested, and for that reason underground rock and roll acquires the character of a secret club whose members identify each other with specialized markings;  with a little effort you can always find out where the people who hated high school as much as you did are hanging out.  You don't have anything in common with the guy or girl at the bus stop, but you can probably start a fucking band with the guy or girl at the bus stop wearing a pin of your  urlLink ABSOLUTE FAVORITEST BAND EVER HOLY SHIT WHERE'D YOU GET THAT ?  It's an instant community you just can't share with someone who's only wearing the same shoes as you.  Unless of course those shoes are Sauconies or black Chuck Taylors, or the holy grail:   urlLink Vision Street Wear .  This in a nutshell is why I love punk rock.  And why I fucking hate the fucking  urlLink Strokes .
