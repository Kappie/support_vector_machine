A 5min skit titled   "Its a Girls Life and We Like It - Episode E=MCÂ²"  watch out guys. cant remember all the quotes but the whole story goes along the lines of a teenage jessica simpson that has friends. And I think they intended to knock themselves  Characters: Asian - Biddy?  The 'other' girl - Bimby? Blonde - Baby RedCurly Head- Well lets call her Bimbo  *4 girls sitting at the table* *Bimbo introduces saying Girls are discussing the life-changing upcoming first prom dance* *Fight happens as they realise that 2 Biddy and Bimby have bought the same dress - the 'ultimate most divine' dress  A few quotes from the story:  Biddy: *says something Tech* Baby: Oh wow that was soo Wise, your like my grandfather. I never understood anything he said. Biddy: Well then how do u know it was wise Baby: Well cos I didn't understand him (note that Baby is a blonde)  Bimby: Guess What!? You know that dress that we saw the other day? I convinced my dad to buy it! Bimbo: NO WAY! *slams table* Biddy: GET OUT! Baby: I think i'm going to cry! Bimby: Whats wrong with that? Biddy: Cos I bought the exact same dress (like in mean girls she must be thinking BIATCH!)  having a current mental blank...i was laughing the whole way through. All this acting is paired with a lot of hilarious exaggerated acting.   Bimbo: Well one way to resolve this issue, whoever bought it first gets to wear it Bimby: Well ye, that'd work. But like, what if, like, u know, I wear the dress with white spunked hair and Asian girl can wear it with u know, like, like black stuff cos ur asian Baby: Oh ye that'd work too Asian Girl: No it wouldn't. Thats stupid Baby: I dont understand Asian Girl: U don't understand anything Baby: Oh ye, thats right  Well you guys must understand the jitz of it. Note that in another episode they will resolve this issue. "So lets like, u know, like how bout we like watch it tmr afterschoolor tape it, u know, thatd be like, really, u know like ye, real cool."
