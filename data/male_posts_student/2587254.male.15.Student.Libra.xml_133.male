Despite mom seeming to think taking to lanes to fill up gas is "normal," everything else went on very well. Oh yeah except for seeing the 3 inch ant that Jason caught in a waterbottle lol. Masonville was great, seeing Shrek 2 and bumpin' into a lot of people also. Finlan, Lindsay, Sarah, Rebecca, Ginnie, and the list goes on. Think I saw over 15 or 20 people there that I knew. Lotta people anyways. So yeah....If you wanna just read about my after school day, scroll down to near the 3/4 mark or so.  So today was final Senior Band rehearsal....well for this year. For Dave Rutt....and some others it's their FINAL band of their lives...at Central. For me....I still got 102+ to go through still for gr. 11 and 12....plus more if I join the other things in music. Awesome band practice though. Some jokes, playing....AND DONUTS ^_^. Mmmm....Timmy's donuts. So talked to Shaunvir and some others about the Senior Band future next year....and Jazz Band. Really hope I make it into Jazz...that'll whoop ass =P. Oh yeah handed in practice log also....still gotta do a review though. So after all that jabbering....it was off to history class.  History we just did reasearch. Really just chatted 'bout stuff with some people, and our group was trying to brainstorm what we'd do for a heritage minute. We still don't know....so yeah we gotta work on that part. Most of the time was just on work....so yeah room was pretty quiet...  Civics class we just studied once again. Me and Hammond started talkin' about the previous teachers that we have had since Wharton is out again w/ a hernia, so yeah we've once again got another sub. Apparently he has a different one though, which is kinda weird. Oh well....so one hour actually passed by pretty quick....and before I knew it it was lunch...  Played ball today during the time of rush dining. Shot around mostly, didn't play mostly because my shot's still horrible, so I decided to work on my shot today. Hmm it's gettin better, my post play is actually not that bad. Only missed like two or three out of 15-20. Too bad I wasn't 6 feet or I'd be playing centre =P. Best position if by my standards, or power forward. Point is....I wish I was taller lol.  So after lunch math class. Reviewed also. Seems like around this time of year like any other year, this time is either tests or reviews for a test or exam or review for an exam. Or a project. So all math class did some review of Sine and Cosine laws, and chatted.  Programming: self explanitory. We programmed.  After school instead of goin' to Jason's to look at his mutated ant I went home instead hoping for a nap. That never happened though as by the time I got home it was almost 4, so I played some games until 5, and then got ready to go to Masonville for Shrek 2. Ate some stuff, and then headed out for the movie...  WHOO I wasn't the last one =P. Apparently Jason was haha. Saw Josh, Steph and Becca first, than Brian and Jason. Oh yeah and Rebecca's friend Rachel came also. Went for 6:30pm show, and oh yeah....saw Gimpy there also. Didn't really talk to him though since well he is a bit of a jackass, so I just said "hey" and went on with my way. So while I was at the thingy where they rip your ticket....yeah I also recognized the person workin' the shift. Apparently Eric in our trombone section was takin' the shift....so me and him sorta thought "Who the hell's that guy? Why's he lookin' at me?" But afterwards we finally figured it out that we both played trombone in band lol. Didn't really recognize him with glasses but his name sounded famliar, and he did resemble someone I could recall. So anyways after a brief chat, headed down to cinema 10 to see Shrek 2...  The previews were all about cartoons and comedies since the movie's PG. So saw a few previews for some movies like a Shark Tale or something, and some other movies that I don't really recall since I was making fun of Rebecca's glasses lol. Oh yeah and the face jokes haha. Anyways the previews went by fast, and the movie started.   SHREK 2 WAS AWESOME!   Won't reveal any of it, other than IT WAS AWESOME! GO SEE IT!  So 2 hour and a half later or so, the movie was over....and a good movie it was. So when we came out I was surprised it was only 8 o'clock or so. So we decided to walk around the mall for a bit. I went outside to call my parents, and then came back in....and they were gone. Josh then also came out, and he also was surprised they were gone. So me, him, and somehow Brian managed to find us walked around for a bit, before bumping into Ginnie and some of her friends. Apparently she was gonna buy a Fender amp *used* for 250 bucks with a cable, but Josh talked her out of it saying it's a ripoff. Even I thought it was though...brand new ones cost that much. Chatted w/ em for a bit, then went on to try to find the rest of the people. While doing so stopped by CompuCentre where I bought a new DDR MAT *^_^* and also by other places. Tested Jason's theory of HMV not knowing about Jin, but at least now they have HEARD of him, just they don't know he has an album lol. SC Ghost is comin' out in a matter of 3 weeks, and also ran into Lindsay, Sarah and Rebecca *no not you Josh's sister I realize you were with us already.* By the time I was done talkin' to 'em, it was 9pm, and we had to go.  Well while waiting for parents, managed to fit in one round of DDR....on a broken mat. Ugh stupid thing making me waste a dollar on only two heavy songs. I coulda easily got 3....but it's hard acing a song when your left arrow doesn't work. Ergh so yeah I did look a bit "poserish and white" *quoted from Dan* and basically wasn't the best time of my DDR playing there. By the time I was done that, got a lift from mom, and we also took Jason home.  After that though....ugh my mom seems to love applying the theory of "Chinese women driving on the sidewalk." Now this may sound stupid to some, but it pisses me off how I was right and yet she totally ignores it and thinks she's right. What happened was while going to fill up gas @ a station, she parks on the right side when our gas tank is on the left. So I thought it was smart to tell her to move to the left so we wouldn't be blocking the people that may want to use the other one....but NOOOOO she seems to think starting an argument with me about how I was wrong and dumber than a rock and how she was right seemed to be more efficient than moving the car to the left to avoid retarded stereotypes and make ourselves look stupid. So in the end she did all the gas filling by herself, and then while heading home....yeah she still didn't really get how it's wrong to clog two lanes to fill up one car at a gas station. She seeems to think the 20 ft. wide lane is meant for one car.  So getting home, after my dad heard about this issue, he also tried to tell her that it's wrong taking up 20 ft.+ of space to fill up a car. She didn't really get it still, and said that both of us were wrong and how there was no problem of her taking up two lanes. Apparently her theory is she's only there for 5 minutes so she can leave. Well at McDonald's an order takes 5 minutes it's not like I'm gonna clog business for an extra 10 minutes doing absolutely nothing. Anyways enough of this, basically she pretty much made part of my night crash and burn....but I don't really care. If she wants to make herself look like she doesn't know how to drive a car...by all means go for it. I REALLY don't care. Yeah I know I shouldn't be pissed off at my parents, well God said so at least, but honestly sometimes she's so ignorant. Also Lina brought up another point. It's SO true that parents seem to think we need all the advice love can buy us, but when WE give them advice, it's worth just as much as the recycled toilet paper at a Loblaws.  But other than that....yeah I loved my day today. Also packin' still tonight for 2morrow....church's annual May Camp retreat. We up at Cambridge this year. Wonder if calls to Toronto are local. If they are I could make a few lol. So yeah better be headin' to sleep now, and also packing. So final words....GO WATCH SHREK 2! Later =).
