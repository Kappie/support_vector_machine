Would you or would you not be in favor of military intervention from the U.S. to prevent crimes against humanity?   Asside from that, if you say we should, but only if the U.N. approves it, then why did the U.N. approve military intervention in Kosovo, but not in Darfur? One was an ethnic clensing of Muslims, the other is an ethnic clensing of non-arabs. Should the distinction make a difference? Why is France once again opposing any intervention?  These are questions that I'd sure like an answer to.
