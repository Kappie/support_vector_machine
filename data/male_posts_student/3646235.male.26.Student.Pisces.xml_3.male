One of my fears about getting sick is if I'm half-way through an experiment.  Would I come in to finish it?  Some of these experiments are expensive and I'd hate to waste the time and money by not coming in.  On the other hand, I wouldn't want to get everyone else sick either.  When someone in Alicia's lab gets sick (they're all in the basement), then everyone gets sick.  Took the morning off to take Ella to the vet.  She should be fine in a few days.  She goes nuts at the vet, she loves them!  It's so embarrasing, I bet they think I can't keep her under control.  Oh well.  Word of the day: propensity - inclination; tendency
