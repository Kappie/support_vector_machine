BATS! yes..... we may have bats... those flying rodents i hold so near and dear to me ... in my attic... yes... i know bats are creepy and disgusting or whatever... it doesn't bother me.... i just like to have tabs on all the critters in my house... right now there are two ... my dog (teddy) and my brother... well maybe only one, my brother......but we could be in store for say ... oh i dont know.. like 50-80 more little critters... i think the only thing that i dont like is that they transmit disease and they poop all over the place... other than that ...... absolutely no problem.... now on the other hand my family has different opinions of these creatures of the night (well after hearing about this... i may have to give this nickname to Clay seeing as he may not sleep for quite a while..) in other news today i had a very good day... a minimal amount of effort was put forth in all of my classes which pleased me to no end.... no effort means nate is happy.... good stuff.... then after school i went to sheetz... my favorite hangout and got iced tea and altoid strips.... yes they make strips now and they kick major ass... then i went to yours truly and ate my favorite dinner, a dinner full of chicken fingers and "extra extra extra" tango sauce (if you dont know... you are not worthy to ask of the tango sauce... quite possibly the best condiment ever created with the exception of ranch or italian dressing), after, i went to swing and got my dance on .... fun times... well now i will end my day with a little bit of effort... mrs. brickley's homework.... good night everyone!
