It'll probably get better after today though.  I'm also starting to think about the direction I want this blog to take after things quiet down a bit. I have a feeling I'm going to split into 2 or more sections in a few weeks: The main blog and perhaps another part dealing with photography and/or some other topic. Don't know yet. Oh yeah, and feel free to comment. Link is available at the bottom of each posting. All comments anonymous of course (unless you let me know who you are).
