Or they could've been tired of living. I really don't know... that i don't want to do for my self-research. But its proven, taking another person's life makes you feel... different, but your conscience will hunt you if it's still strong. Many people kill others willingly without hesitation, and without any good reasons to kill.  So it was written...
