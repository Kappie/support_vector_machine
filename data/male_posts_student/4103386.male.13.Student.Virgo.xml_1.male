Today was s0 fun, i went for kayaking in the morning, church in the afternoon and L-cell in the night. In kayaking, we paddled under Merdeka Bridge to a deserted beach. Then, we beached our kayaks and took a swim out to sea(with our life jackets of course). The filthy water was so salty that everyone was choking and gagging on it... 0_o As usual, i found that i had fibreglass splinters from carrying the kayaks. The rough sand on the beach had worn off shards of fibreglass and they got embedded in my arms and hands as i carried the kayak back to base. They were stinging me badly...my arms were covered with red spots... At church, bryan gave me some scotch tape which i used to stick the fibreglass out from my arms(wow that hurt)...the wounds closed up amazingly fast ^^ After church we had L-cell. We walked to the botanic gardens to have dinner at food haven by the park. Guess who we met there? My mum!!! Argh ~.~ And we were sitting close together too...Mel tortured me...  After dinner and cell discussion, we proceeded to the park for a game. Since it was Charlotte's and Rachel's birthday, we decided to play a trick on them. We pretended to play a game of sardines, where one person had to go hide and others and to go find him. But in this case, we all had a pre-arranged meeting point. Soon, the two girls were wandering around alone in the dark park, looking very lost. Meeting up, Bro. Adrian decided to send Yeow and I to lure the girls to the 'ambush' point. Things went so liquid smoothly! The girls were feeling skittish after wandering around the deserted park and wanted to follow me and Yeow around looking for Bro. Adrian...we led them to the pavillion and the others jumped out and yelled,  "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!" and strted singing the birthday song....it was so cool and funny :) L-cell is so fun :D
