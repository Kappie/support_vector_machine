I was minding my own business playing some   urlLink Dungeon Siege: Legend of Aranna   (you know... Aranna... right?) when I was broadsided by a maternal mastication of magnificently malicious margins. I hate when that happens. Out of nowhere, even on a good day, death, doom and destruction strikes and suddenly I'm the  Great Satan (tm)*. I really wish I had some warning. So I have to bail from DS and go and placate the situation. It'd be like  urlLink Colin Powell  trying to coax  urlLink Osama's  finger off the button. It IS like that. And yet I manage to. It's a tough haul. In the process of these negotiations my throat was stripped of all its moisture setting my recovery back several decades.   *Great Satan is a registered trademark of Islamic Jihaad     Secondly:   urlLink RSS  ,  urlLink  ATOM   and   urlLink Aggregators  . If you read or publish a blog, chances are you've got an RSS/ATOM feed to go along with it. What is an RSS/ATOM feed? RSS stands forReally Simple Syndication - ATOM stands for... uh... truth, justice and home publishing.It's like a ticker tape of your blog (made with this special ingredient - XML - theColonel's 11 th  spice)which can be picked up by an aggregator.   Essentially this is the way it works - every time you blog, it creates an entry into this file in the same directory as your blogger file. That file is usually called atom.xml* - if you're on blogger. This file can be  subscribed to  in your aggregator so that when changes are made, the aggregator sychronizes and  knows . It saves you wandering to blogs that haven't been updated (I hate that).  *you can change this to anything you'd like.xml   Right now I'm using BlogExpress Reader - first and foremost, it's free. Secondly, it's good - mwaha, price over quality every time. If you read my blog and you've got one of your own - investigate whether you have an RSS or ATOM feed - if you do, email me! If you'd like to subscribe to the feed here it's at  urlLink http://members.rogers.com/grahamw/atom.xml   I've just been told that Lucas is going back to the original trilogy and dressing them up for a new generation. Fucking hell. Hayden in RoTJ. Greedo shooting first. That rediculous Jabba scene in the first one. Random McDiarmid in Empire. I bet Bobba Fett is going to make it out of the Sarlacc pitt unharmed after the credits of RoTJ as well. FUCKING HELL. Glad I've got the originals on DVD already. Yeah, that's right. FUCK YOU MPAA!  On that note, the force will be with the one who ends him.
