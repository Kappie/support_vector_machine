(was that a run-on sentance?) it'll prolly be something to the effect of "burning in the bosom: emotional reaction to religious experience." i'm going to argue that the 'burning in the bosom' and other emotions that are often claimed as spiritual experiences are not the actual religious experience, but rather an emotional reaction to an underlying religious experience. in mormon terms, my having that 'burning' is not myself feeling the spirit, but is rather an emotional reaction to knowledge i gain by the spirit. this will also act as a defense to the criticism that we often feel the same feelings of religious experience when we watch movies and listen to music.
