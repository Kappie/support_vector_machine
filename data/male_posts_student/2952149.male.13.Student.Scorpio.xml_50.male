Ok so first I get to school at like 8:25 and I didn't realize that I needed all of my teachers to sign this paper saying that I would be in guitar class all day. So Chris and I went around to all of my teachers to get them to sign. Oh and I wore kacki shorts and a golf shirt for the concert so at about 9:00 I go to the stage to get tuned and everything and she was like "Are you going to change your shorts?" I was like "Um....no, I thought you said no jeans." It turns out you can't wear jeans or shorts but all I had were jeans and those shorts so I told her that and she said that LONG jeans would be ok. Sebastian, who is a skinny little nothing said he had an extra pair of jeans so I went to try those....and people keep in mind the show was in a half an hour, but ofcourse they were too small because im a fat ass lol. So then I was like oh fuck I am not going to be able to play but then I called my mom and she drove home and brought me some jeans so I ran and put those on, got my guitar, tuned up (It was seriously out of tune lol), and practiced a little bit with Austin all in time for the concert. Holy crap I was....there is no word to describe the way I was feeling. So we did surprisingly well....the last few groups that is. She put us in order from worst to best, best went last. We did good...everyone cheered and stuff and it felt good after practicing so much. Yeah so that was basically it, after that we just stayed inm the class room and watched "Shool of Rock" and jammed. After school I went to visit my grandma at the hospitol. That was my day.
