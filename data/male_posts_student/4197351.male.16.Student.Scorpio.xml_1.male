I realized now why nobdoy likes freshmen, because I bet we were the same way a few years ago. Any way After that was all over with, I went and saw all of the teachers in which homework was a possibility.... and found out hat my only homework is to shop, which is no problem. My teachers seem nice, but I have learned to never judge a book by its cover. speaking of books.... the reading that I had been freaking out about doing last weekend... YEA... IT IS OPTIONAL, THAT IS LAMEEEEEE!!!!! I DO NOT DO OPTIONAL ASSIGNMENTS, unless i turn in an ond project again. So anyway I HATE SCHOOL, and school hates me! That is all, Dont forget that you can get 10 bucks for doing nothing by going to  urlLink http://www.freeiPods.com/default.aspx?referer=7875766  (sign up with a free email account), then once you ahve done that sign up for a 14 day free trial of ancestory.com  Use it for like 2 or 3 days, cancel it.... and when it registers on me... I will give you 10 bucks... and all you have lost is that you will get some spam... so make a bogus email account?!?!
