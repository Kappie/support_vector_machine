Ahh... i feel glad for them, and sorry for me... because i supposedly graduated today, but some technical problem prevent me from being happy n nervous like my friends... i had to continue for another semester and my graduation day shud be a year from now... August 2005... but life has to go on anyway...  That's all... just wanna congrats them on their graduation... and happy job hunting... i want to continue my reading... Elizabeth was getting scarier becoz her only trusted employee had been assasinated (Sidney Sheldon - Bloodline)  Today, just like any day before... it is HOT... i can say it is almost 40deg C... but i think it is okay becoz it is better a shiny day rather than rainy... if it is to rain, i do hope it will be this midnight... so that i can sleep with my comforter wrapped around me like a cocoon...  okey, time to get back to my book... (aaa i miss her again)
