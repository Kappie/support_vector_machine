I only learned of the vote when i passes my polling place and found the signs "Vote Here!" I of course voted to save my family hundreds of dollars next year in taxes.   I can't possibly relate the level of anger I feel at the results of this referrendum. The masses have voted to screw me out of my money for absolutely no benefit to me whatsoever. I can possibly support screwing me for welfare or other handouts. Those are protection money. But this is a total waste of taxpayer money. The schools simply need to spend less. Money is not the panacea to education problems. The true sources of learning are cheap and readily available. Small, rectangular objects called books. I bet this sales tax money just goes straight into teacher's pockets.   I sure wish I could use "the children" as an excuse to rob my fellow citizens of their money. Then I would be a teacher. That's one lesson I learned today.
