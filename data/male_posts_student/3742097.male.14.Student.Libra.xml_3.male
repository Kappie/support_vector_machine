Even greater news is that becasue of the rainout the pitcher who was supposed to pitch today will pitch tomorrow, and that is great.  So tonight is bound to be slow, my parents aren't home. Too bad there isn't a girl around, lol. But I did make myself some excitment. I saw some people walking into my neightbor's house while I was looking out my bedroom window. So I saw these people, there were two of them, and the one walked inside already and the other was almost inside. But would I stand for that? Of course not! Seeing this happen I wistled, quite loudly, and he kept on walking. So I wistled a second time. This time he heard me and stopped walking and looked around. But, of course, he didn't see me because I was in my room. So that was a little funny.   But now I have nothing to do so I will listen to some music and see if we have Ice Cream. And oh yeah, think about tomorrow. We leave in less than 12 hours! And no, I will not be counting down until I do leave, even I have limits. :)
