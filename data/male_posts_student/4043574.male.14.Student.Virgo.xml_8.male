Just more relaxing.  3rd day - Total mystery to me and my sister...my Aunt wont tell me where we are going. She wakes us up at 6am to get ready, and we are outta the house by 7am. Then we drive for 4 hours to "hearst castle". Its some castle type thingy that this really rich guy built, now its a historical landmark or something. After going on the tour of the castle, we went to our hotel and i swam in the pool with my sister for like 5 hours.  4th day - Another long drive. Again my aunt wont tell us where we are going. It was supposed to be a 2 hour drive but there was a lot of people that drove really really slow and we couldn't pass them so it was more like 3 hours. We finally got to our hotel...called the Econo-Lodge...wow, that sounds classy. We then drove for like 15 mins to a place called "mystery spot" where anything round rolls uphill, and you can walk up walls and stuff...im gonna have my aunt get her pics on a CD so i can post some here. Then we drive back to our hotel and i swim with my sister again, only for 3 hours this time.  5th day - Did i mention that we were in Sana Cruz? Haha. Beach! Santa Cruz Boardwalk, that was fun. A few good rides, foood, girls...haha. And the beach...that was cool, except i have sand all over me because theres so much sand in the water...and because i got buried. Haha, that was fun. Now for the drive back to my Aunts house. It should have been like an hour drive, but my uncle got lost for a few mins, then there was a wreck somehwhere, and that made a lot of traffic. Finally 2 hours later we get back to my Aunt's house. I watch a lil tv then crash at about midnight.  6th day - Today my Aunt had to go to a friends sisters funeral. I get to stay at her house and just eat ice cream all day and watch more tv. Nothin special.  7th day - Today was the last day... :( . We went to a place called Boomers...they have go karts, batting cages, mini golf, arcade, that type of stuff. It was fun. I hate the words 'i dunno' right now. You will be shot if u say that more than 2 times in a day to me. :-) Unless ur name is Jordan then you can say it all u want.  8th day - I flew back home...and we got Krsipy Creme donuts...it was awesome! But when we were boarding, the dude takin the ticket things asked how old me and my sister were...i said 14, and my sis said 12. Then the guy is like she has to be 13 to fly unless there is someone 18 years old with her. WTF! My Aunt had to pay 30$ so this lady that worked for the airport and was going to seattle anyway could walk my sis on and off the plane...it was so fucked up....it never happened any other time i've taken a cousin or sibling along that was under 13. Stupid airport.
