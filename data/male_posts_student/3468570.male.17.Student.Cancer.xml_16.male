This is so cool, given the special number~~! =P Anyway, the past few weeks have been full of corniness...especially with me sufferin' from PMS sometimes. [Yes! Some boys do get them, ya know?]  Hmmm....what's today main focus of the entry? Oh yes I got it! My agenda: To write down...er....nothing? Never mind...my mind's going crazy~~! =/ Maybe I should write some horrible facts about my CTG girls....hahaha~~!! Let's see...   Goh KG ~ The oldest of the group...so is the grandma of the class lor~~! Nothing to say  about her...just only her lame quotes like 'Tell me a joke.' Rumored to be in 'les'  with MJ, but believed to have been dumped 'cause latter wants to be straight.  Peh MJ ~ Probably the most dominant of the group...not a good sign. Maybe just like Lina  Lo from GYMS, now in SRJC. Too outspoken and sometimes want to flaunt off  her English but can't do it 'cause she she she she can't do it. And and and and  always look like like like she want to sue ya'.  Sila ~ Yay! One of my few trusted allies in YJC! Also speaks in the anti-MJ league~! But  since she's my ally...I can't say much about her  lor !  Wah....too many girls to write....and so hard to edit.  Haiz!  Maybe this would be better should I write in my handwritten diary instead. [ Muscle power is so much better.... ] Hmmm....there's plans to write a Constitution to guide the pupil Alvin Tan of CTG 125 who looks like a bloody nerd similar to the Andrew in his history class. Somemore, he wants to be the next Mr. Loke...who is so damn sickening too.  Kiam pah bo?  Oh yes, his face's one  kiam pah  type too!   Hmmm....what should I say more about Alvin Tan? And ya lor...his name is so damn irritating...with the TAN in it of course. Instead...we can call him Alvin Tan Wang Ba Dan...suitz his name too instead of that girly name of Jing Ren who sounds like sissy who behaves like some whore back in his heyday. [Whoever can go wallop him for me secretly...I'll sponser  de ~~]   HEY! Why am I insulting myself? WOW....I can insult myself so well??? I LOVE this kind of hatemail....wonder when will they make an Alvin Tan hatelisting in future? Oops...I mean the stupid Alvin Tan who couldn't even make it to a good institute of learning...especially going to pathetic schools like SSS....triple asses. [Serangoon Seconday School]   Okok.....this is getting into a madcap....time to end up here~~~BYE  See YA!~~~!!!
