You see, they're wasting their time and money on those things instead of studying. And when they go to class, all their main topic is "Counter Strike" and "Ragnarok" which for me, just keeps me annoyed. And the owner of this shop (Web Guide, which is just around thevicinity) said that NO BYSTANDERS ALLOWED. And why would they ever consider these children hanging out here if THEY (children)have no business but to watch other people play or chat with other people.  Second, those bums around the Univeristy Belt which keeps on bothering the students eating or walking to their respective schools. What's inside their heads? Students are considered as rich people?! We students are getting nuts driving these people out of our lives. Government officials should do something on them, by simply driving them out of U-Belt and sending them to a nice relocation site. Or send them to jail! Hahaha! Bitchy me...  GAAAAAAAAK! The time's almost up! Gotta go!
