I went over at about midnight and she was stood there in a really nice long black dress and there were candles all over the place. They led up the stairs and into her bedroom. In there she had glasses of wine* awaiting us and rose petals* scattered around her room. It was a really nice atmosphere. And then she asked to get back together. I was a bit unsure and cautious at first but then I realised it would be too hard to say no.  * when I say wine, I mean Smirnoff Ice! * the fact that the rose petals were fake didn't matter to me!  Anyways, today I went on a sunbed. It wasn't great but wasn't bad. The whole experience was very greasy. I went on for just 6 minutes but by the end I was dripping in sweat and had a tingling sensation all over my body. Overall, I don't think it made much difference but I'm thinking about making it a regular thing...
