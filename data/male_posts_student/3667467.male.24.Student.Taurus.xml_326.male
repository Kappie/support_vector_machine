Instead of being a regular oven, it's more like a hot plate that looks like a cross between the front of the Starship Enterprise and a Mr. Fusion machine from Back To The Future. Apparently it will shave 10-15 minutes off of my waiting-for-pizza-to-cook time, which I usually spent folding laundry, reading mail, or doing something else constructive (e.g. using the bathroom). Now I'll be saving so much time nothing will get done.
