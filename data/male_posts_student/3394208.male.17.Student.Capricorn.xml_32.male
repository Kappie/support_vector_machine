This new found knowledge explains alot, my main feature which in being; my nose... My knack of knowing how to get into and out of trouble... alot more... they say knowledge is brought down upon men through text and novelty, and recently noted, knowledge is brought down upon men by the origin of his blood,our paths have already been lain upon us even before our birth... it has been decided by our bloodlines... fascinating this new found truth...
