I don't know if they're good or bad, since they really stereotype Asians.   Hmm... so what did I do yesterday? Not a lot actually. I lounged around and read some Braudel. I also did some chatting with my mom and let her know how school is coming along.  Right now I'm trying to listen to my  Bad Religion  CDs in order. I'm in 1991 right now. It's funny how music really takes you back to different points in your life.  I didn't really sleep well last night. My lungs felt congested.  I need to call Cissa later to see if she still wants to go to the boardie meet up in Pasadena.  ***
