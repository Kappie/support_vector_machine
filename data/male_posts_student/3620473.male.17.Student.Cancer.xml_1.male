It was a good movie, but diana was there. WTF?! and her and curry talked thru the entire thing, and im sorrie, but talking like you are at your house and carrying on a full conversation is fucking rude. It pissed me off royal. Specially how days before she told me she never comes down and hangs out around here. Will Smith had a good way of putting it in I, Robot. He used the whole he sneezed thing and the guy who was talkin looked at him funny. Then he apologized, said it was simply that he was alergic to bullshit, haha!  Alright, its almost 3 in the morning, damn, 9 there. But hey! It is the 25th! You get home the 28th! yay! *mwah*  gnite, or gmorning, whatever the fuck it is. I love you.
