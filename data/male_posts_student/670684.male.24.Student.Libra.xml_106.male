According to the website, two Italian brothers manned a Ham radio and kept track of the goings-on with the cosmonauts.  There are a number of interesting tidbits on this site, as well as some bone-harrowing audio files of two people said to have died in space...one male launched two months before Gagarin, and one a female launched soon after.    The Russians were known to have tampered with history in order to purify their space program; in order to look perfect, and imperfections in the program were  urlLink erased  from history.  Had the Americans found out about deaths in space, or even cosmonauts-in-training with shady records, the poor press and subsequent media frenzy would have weakened an already frail Russian nationality.    I consider myself to be a quite trusting person, but only on an individual level.  The larger the corporation, the less room I give it to shake.  I don't trust multi-national corporations.  I trust local and state governments less than that.  I trust the federal government less than any local or state branch.  I trust insurance companies less than the US government.  And high on the perk, with little chance of being dethroned, is my complete and total lack of trust in the  urlLink press media .    Yet these conscious mistrusts of large organizations bent on keeping a status-quo designed to misalign the majority of people still get called into question due to my hegemonic training.  Everything I ever learned in school taught me that the United States was a country that worked for the little man, helped people and countries in trouble, and was the greatest place to live on Earth because it cared the most about the Earth.  God, the number of songs I sang in elementary school classes to show my pride in the U.S. of A is disgusting, looking back on it.  I view a website whose claims have vaild evidence behind them, yet I look at it in limbo because the message says that governments lie.  And I still have trouble believing that.  I've parused a few books claiming that the US flights to the moon were a  urlLink hoax , and while the evidence in those books is much less convincing than the Cosmonaut claims, I still leave it to Tom Foolery, because why would the government ever lie?    My grandmother and I both saw  urlLink Bowling for Columbine , albeit in seperate locations.  This woman is a steadfast Republican who honestly believes that the world is good, that the United States is a country fixed on helping the poor, huddled masses of the world, and that heroes are Heroes, and Charlton Heston and Dick Clark are both heroes.  When I try to talk to her about the messages of the film, her first point is always about the negative:  "He talks about all of the bad things the United States has done.  What about the good things to help others?"  My response is always the same: "We get the good in school and in the media; we never hear the bad.  Moore is balancing the equation."  Once we beat that down, and I try to ask her opinion on the film, she goes for the jugular:  "Well, I don't like how he treated Charlton Heston or Dick Clark."  Moore is a great filmmaker, but he comes off as abrasive and antagonistic, and in his interviews with celebrities where Moore's agenda is clearly stated, the celebrity never comes off in a positive light.  Thus, my grandmother's hero is hurled down in a less-than-alluring light, and she does her damndest to defend him.    I can despise the media and hate the world that they create for us (I am a firm believer in the teachings of  urlLink Jean Baudrillard  and his belief that television no longer mirrors society, but it is now society that mirrors television), yet I still put blind faith into their teachings.  One such example is the theory of matter, made famous by Isaac Newtown.  Newtown's thoughts on the structure of matter, mainly the atom and its elements, is written in every Science textbook today, and possibly the greatest staple of the field.  However, Ben Gray, a former physicist and aide to Robert Oppenheimer, opposes this idea of the atom and matter in general, saying that the proton and the neutron don't exist; it's all electrons.  Gray lived in Jacksonville, Texas up until his death last February, and through several intermediaries, my current roommate met him and was given a taped lecture by Gray about his theories of matter (he also wrote a pretty good  urlLink screenplay  around the theory).  However, rather than watch the tape, I castigated Brian for even believing the ramblings of this old man...quoting the time-honored traditions of science, and asking why the establishment would lie to us.    However, I know realize why the establishment would lie to us - SELF-PRESERVATION.  I'll get into what it means to lie to people more later.  Right now, I'm interested in watching that tape of Ben Gray...hopefully I'm old enough now to give it a try.
