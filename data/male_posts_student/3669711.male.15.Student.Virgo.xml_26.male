Gaia is not a conventional "game", you can't even put it in the same catagorie as games.  It's a message board system/community.  You post, you get posts back.  There are a TON of people who are on gaia, something like over 1, 000, 000 users registered.      You get gaia "gold" for everything you do on the site, for posting, for just browsing.  With that gold, you can buy clothes for your avatar in 1 of 5 shops that gaia holds.  If you're not into dressing up your avatar, you can always just post around.  But be warned, Gaia is not for everyone.      One of my friends doesn't like gaia because of too many posts.  You can't keep track of the threads you post in very easily, and i really don't see a point in keeping track of them, unless you are in the "Extended Discussion" forum.      I have fun in gaia, and i know many people who share the same views as me on this site.  It's just not for everyone.  Well, i'm off to watch some anime now!      Lates
