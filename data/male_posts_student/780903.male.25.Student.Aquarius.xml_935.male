Letterman asked whether anyone would really want to be his first patient.  But so much further the joke could have gone.  I really wouldn't want to be Howard Dean's patient: "First I'm going to look in your nose; then I'm gonna look in your ears; then I'm gonna look down your throat; and then I'm gonna **stick this tube all the way into your colon**.  Yeaaaaaaaagh!"  Or at least that's how I would have written the joke.
