We (my mum, my brother and myself) arrived at the cinemas an hour early to just go and get some good seats. All the waiting I feel was worth it as we were the first ones in the cinema and got to chose some really great seats! It was unbelieable! It lasted 2 hours and 15 mins long but time just flew by!  The movie was just amazing. I wont go into too much detail as I dont want to ruin it for all of you out there that are going to see it. The special effects are absolutely incredible. The way in which the cast have 'grown up' within a space of a year is amazing, while the actual Dementors that are in the movie have been portrayed just as J.K.Rowling described them - scary, evil beings!  I feel that the movie did live up to the book and in some areas was better than the book itself. I really enjoyed the film so much and give it 11/10! My favourite section of the movie would have to be Hermione and Harry using the 'timeturner' to turn back time. The way in which the movie portrays this part of the movie is fascinating as the audience get to know some 'hidden' secrets which does not make sense at the beginning of the film!  All in all this film was fab and I can't wait for the fourth one to come out! Im not going to say anymore about the movie as it would ruin it for everyone else!  Im going to keep you all posted about Wednesday later on!  Bye!  Stefan
