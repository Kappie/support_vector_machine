That is the random thought for the day. No, actually, I have many more.  My good fellows are as follows: Elise - my patron goddess with silver wings. She rules the site  urlLink When doves cry . She is a poet and a writer and a graphic artist and she is an angel. She is also the only person I know in this little group that can drive alone.  Alanna - goddess/saint of computers that deserve to be damned to hell and back again. She is the supernatural spirit/janitor of the site  urlLink DOY . She too is a writer and a poet and her younger sister Morgan is also wicked at the visual and intellectual. Don't listen to Alanna when she says her poems are crap. They are not.  Brock - an acquaintance I have met through Elise and wish I could be around him more because he is an awesome guy and - you guessed it - a poet and a writer and a consummate graphic artist. You will go  urlLink to the Bat Cave  right now and see his blog. Brock speaks a wicked French tongue and he will move to France some day. He is a French god stuck in the US of A.  Becca - I do not know Becca all too well but I have met her through Elise and the whole DOY gang. She is a freaking genius on the guitar, I am establishing that fact right this moment. Meet up with her at  urlLink Cylindrical Poppycock and other Nonsensicle Things . And obey the word of the new rock goddess who posts on  urlLink DOY .  Zo- a dancer goddess. She cruelly made me dance for the camera when we were filming to make Elise and Brock feel guilty about deserting us for a small insignificant writing camp. She is hysterical. She lacks a blog location right now, but go to DOY and you can absorb the power of her poetry and writing.  Robin - she is not really a member of DOY but she has a profile there. Robin is the queen/goddess of the four young men who exist in all times as the Beatles. But do not say Paul McCartney in her presence. She will utterly smite you. Visit and see her disposition to our "beloved" McCartney.  urlLink The Evil Empire .  Tarah - a wicked spanish speaker, a wicked poet and a wicked artist. She is soo damn good at art it isn't funny. And she posts on DOY, and she is really a nice person to be around. She has not a blog address that I can post, for apparently there are so very many blogs that she owns.  David - okay, D-Dawg here doesn't engage in activities with the previously stated list of fellow poets and writers. In fact, he may hold a grudge against a few of them. (Not telling who....they know who they are). But David is still a cool Japanese-speaking dude. And he's Jewish too! And that leads me to matzos, which are also good. Sorry about that.  Miles - a recent friend that I have become acquainted to in a very short time. She went to Bridge Builders camp the same week I did and, despite the restrictions of different teams and all that, she and I are good friends. She wishes for me not to post the address of her blog. I honor that request. And, by the way, she's a poet!  Meg - a recent friend that I have become acquainted to in a very short time after an infinitly long time that I regret I did not speak to her. She and I are old friends from way back when...definately before school begins for children. She is so very kind and pleasant and sweet. She drives also. And, hot damn, she is a poet too!  Cheers, my fellow mortals. These are my companions. Have a nice evening. Or don't. But hurry and make up your mind.
