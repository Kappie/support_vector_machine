I don't really think it's that that is causing me to feel like this, I just think it triggered something. Even my friends from college noticed I wasn't myself today and they are some of the most unobservant people I know. Ah well. Hopefully it's just a phase. Mandy's coming over later in some new 'gear'. She's gonna look so lovely. I can't wait to just hold her. I've been missing her a lot today. I've been thinking about this relationship and how we are with each other. Most of the time it's really nice but when it's bad, it's really bad. But I love her and nothing will change that =)
