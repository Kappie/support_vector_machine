The place relatively cooler than the main city, is good enough to beat the heat but the immense overcrowding makes it loose its charm as a good picnic spot. The hiking trail there is nice and long enough, and probably enjoyable, given that you go in a group of friends and not as family in which there are great variations in stamina. I found that to my expense when I was abandoned at around one-fourth the length of the track.  Anyhow, if youâ€™re tired of your summer vacations and live in the twin cities, a trip to Pir Sohawa might give you a nice day off.
