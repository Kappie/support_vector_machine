We went to Wal-Mart again, aching my legs off because of the largeness of the store, and after that, heading to McDonalds via Target to get the sweets to bring back home :)  I had another super large Dr. Pepper, and I was able to drink it this time without feeling like one of Ryan's Birthday balloons lol.  When we got back we went out in the back garden to play pinyatta.  When Ryan had finally smashed it to bits, we all grabbed the sweets and cheap plastic toys which fell out lol!  It was fun ;)  I've nearly packed my case now.  It's ready for my hard drive to be packed snugly between my clothes so that it don't break.  I'm getting nervous for the flight home again, not long at all now!  Nervous about returning to school, I can't believe there's only a year and a half left of that, scarrry :| (Even though I'm not going to be there a year and a half lol)  After a long day, and my head is still hurting grr, I'm off...
