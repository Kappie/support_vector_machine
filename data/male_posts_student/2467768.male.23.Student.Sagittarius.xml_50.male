Curtin is only of my top choices, when they offered me a double degree, Bachelor in Bussiness Administration and Computer Science. Yes, I do have the idea of going to school with Hazlina Hanaffi, way before last year.   One of the reason, why I am not heading for Perth, even not for Murdoch, due to the recognisation. Wollongong is still one of the top for the IT industry. That why I am heading for Wollongong. And Wollongong is really a distant from Perth, even also from Sdyney.   80km down south, sitting below than 15 degree, sometimes reaching about 0 degree. It does really can make me feel homesick. Hafizah Hashim, Juliana Jamal, Nurliza Kamarudin and Nuradlin Ayob all are back in Singapore. Even, Rahizan Zainuldin also have headed back home.   I am only left with this Firdaus Zakaria. He is a good man. But, sometime I am do really feel down, to some issues maybe, I am too sensitive. Which I gues I am, currently now. I need friends, friends who I can trusts, jokes, and going to place where we can enjoy ourselves... Just like my brother, Abdul Razak A. Rahman. I guessed, Razak still the best, no one to replace his accompanionship.  My girlfriend? She is great, I am thankfull to God, till today, I am still with her. But just lastly , I am really quite ignore by her characters. Just that she is not used to be the collage gal, I love so much. True, she is trying to change herself so much. I can see her losing her weight and her hair is dye, brown...   I told her I prefered gals with highlight hair, not brown. But .. it alright, I am not fussy about that. Cos, shw look much interesting now with bown hair. There is she online now. Just give her a minute , she will click and try to cath with me. For now, it is alright for me.   But during exam, she kepe talking wired stuffs to me . That really making me pissed off. Anyway, i am already happy with my girlfriend. But, if she want to be anger with me asking me what is wickedweasel gal? I dunn really care.  I am really feel to the maximum of boreness in my life. Hoping on the July 1st, I would clear all my exam and pass with credits. Insya-Allah.  Yupz, sometimes, in the middle of the nite, my tears do flow out. I never cry in my sleep, thinking about my dad, when i am in the army. I guess Australia, this phase of life is much tougher than army ....  All I wise was November 27 to come soon...
