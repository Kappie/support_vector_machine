It was waaay the hell out there and it was like 9 or so when we got there.  We were waiting in lines for at least an hour in the cold and Beckman didn't have a jacket.  So, yeah, I was sorry for him and said I'd buy him a double quarter pounder because the haunted castle was sub-par.  On the plus side, I learned a lot about what Beckman was up to recently and stuff(he's 2 or so pieces away from winning a plasma TV in the Mcdonald's Monopoly).  So the three of us went to Mickey-D's and chowed down.  Mmmmmm...... heart-disease-y.  Then we dropped Beckman off.  Then as Kyle and I were in the car, I realized my zipper was undone.  And I don't know how long it was like that, heh.  Oh well.    DON'T FORGET TO SET YOUR CLOCKS BACK!
