Buffalo Boarding and Rice Surfing     Not in the sense you're boarding a buffalo like a pirate (ahoy mateys! thar be a buffalo! avast ye and board her! aaargh!) but in the sense you're using a board to 'ski' behind the water buffalo or 'surf the rice' as the case may be.    So the premise is this, a boarder, using a snowboard or a smallish surfboard (a boogie board might be better) is pulled by a water buffalo across the rice paddy. The hard part is having the water buffalo maintain momentum such that the boarder maintains movement so he can do some totally gnarly moves bra!  (you have to say the last 4 words with a Keanu Reeves accent).    Speaking of Keanu, did you know that my Hawaiian name is Keoni? It was given to me by one of the staff at the hospital I worked at in Hawaii. According to her, you can only be given a Hawaiian name by someone with Hawaiian ancestry (she's 3/4 Hawaiian, nice lady, good with drawing blood and IV sticks, teaches hula). So after she named me Keoni (which is just John in Hawaiian), the rest of the kama aina staff (Hawaii born locals)  started calling me Keoni. I got used to it that I almost never responded to John. :)
