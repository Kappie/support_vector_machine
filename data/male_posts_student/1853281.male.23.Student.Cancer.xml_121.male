I am knitting and doing my dishes before i go to bed and doing my chores on the days i decided they get done, and doing this  according to schedule  . Crazy And nothing really has been going on. Hung out with J.H. last night. Hit up the two for one's at Lyles and then watched a movie and talked until like three. It was great. But i got uber cranky at the end as i was allready sleep deprived, and then was even more tired. Sorry J-dawg! Down to Dad's this weekend for father's day. no other news
