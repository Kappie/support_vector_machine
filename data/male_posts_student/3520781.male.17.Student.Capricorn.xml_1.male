Spend like the whole day at home watching Tv  sitting in front of the computer. Yesterdae went back to sch to help out with the training of P.A members in school, was glad to see Midsean, Shao ming  ivan as well. simon also came back to sch to help out as well, so did Dennis.... Non the less, it was enjoyable helping them out, then there was tis boy by the name of guan wei, really had some attitude prob. but still i found tis guy rather amusing.... He could do lots of stuff in a really short time, at first i thought he was one the real trouble maker in the CCa... but still, he proved me wrong  now i think that keeping him in P.A may come in handy.... Well, anyway, the whole group of us( Dennis, Simon, Me, Midsean, Shao Ming  Ivan) met up with Eddie, Caspar  Lead Whye, to have dinner with both our ex P.A teachers, Ms Lim SH  Ms Tan CK for dinner @ Plaza Singapore. We had Pastamania tat nite  could u imagine tat ms lim (now teaching in RI) treated the whole lot of us for dinner, tat has been like the 3rd time she treated such a grp like us... we were really grateful.... After dinner, we all went upstairs to the 1st floor where we sat at Macdonalds open air tables,  chat for another 2 hours before leaving.... But still, i had to go back to school todae to get my 'O' level cert which i left it with Shao ming the dae before.... so forgetful of me..... Bought the music CD 'Speed Up', i think its a crap CD, knew i shldn't have bought it.... Around 8pm 2dae, my whole family went out together for a walk at AMK.... i just hope 2molo will be a good dae as i would be heading down to the GYM to sweat my fats out, hope 2molo will really be good to sweat off my excess Fats.....
