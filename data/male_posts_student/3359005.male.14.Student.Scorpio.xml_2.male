Sorry to those people, because I've just been so touched by the song "I Believe", and I'm gonna right about the finale of a phase in my life, and the beginning of another.  My dear friends would know that today was my last day at a place that I've detested and cursed for 2 years; the Boarding School. As I lay on my bed, the one that always seemed so uncomfortable at night but so appealing in the day, I heard the sound of something bead like falling on the floor. I looked in between the gape of the bed and the wall, and there was this glass star, the star that I had recieved on my first week here. I felt it extremely appropriate that I got the star back at the start of a new chapter in my life.  Enoch and Ken Wei helped to carry my stuff down, and him waving as my car went off reminded me of the ending of the movie "Big Fish", where the characters of the persons life waved him his last goodbye, without any tears, but instead with joy. It is today, as I wave goodbye to the shining star of Miss Barrino, that I've grown the "10 inches more" that mother has always wanted...
