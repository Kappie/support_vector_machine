Although many people didn't thinkthat we did good I think we did and everyone is entitled to thier own opinions. So yeah I had a conference with Mrs.Brennan, Mr. Herz, Mrs. Stonis, Mrs.Lukich, Mrs. O' halloran , and the dreaded Mrs.Smith about my grades. They were all concerned and everything because they were all like " you are a very intelligent student and we know you can do better than you are now, you were doing great the first two quarters then your grades just tanked so...." yeah and they all like put in thier own opinions and everything and it made me fell good and bad at the same time. I think that they made me feel good because I felt that they were concerned enough to do that for me and all and it made me feel bad because i knew what i had to change and I didn't want to do it because I might fall asleep in class and i want to do it because I want to do better so i can be in the honors classes next year and they know I can do better than I am now an they implied that they expect great things fromme so yeah they said that they didn't want to see some with my talent and intelligence in a class where they know i should be. Yeah so i think the whole depression thing kicked in after that and i poured out my feeling to me best friend " the chi" she really puts things in perspective for me and she really makes me feel better. And yeah i really don't wanna have my schedule changed so I know what i have to do and I'm going to do just that and forget about the falling asleep in class if it will help me in the long run so I'm bout to shut down me comp and everything so I'll talk to "you people" (as sonya would say) later.  and yeah chichi I didn't tell sonya just for you and I'll see you later.
