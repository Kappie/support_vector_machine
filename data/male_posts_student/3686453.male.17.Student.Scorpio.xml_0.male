Having never attempted it before, I was slightly nervous.  I did ok, except for the part when I hit the other Honda’s bumper while pulling out.  Both cars were ok, but I just got more nervous.  When I went to the test, I remembered that there were two instructors.  The guy was easy, while with the lady you make the smallest mistake and BANG.  So I'm sitting there, then the guy comes over.  Whew.  Went through the test and managed to pass.  I'm a pretty safe driver, unless you guarantee me that there are no cops around.  I respect their profession, but they do function as a slight deterrent.  Which is probably a good thing.  Probably.  What else happened last week?  Let me see... oh yeah.  I had the job "training" thingy on Thursday morning.  The job looks like a cakewalk, at least on the assigned dates.  See, we work on 15 specified days, then we have several other days where we are just called in.  You do a lot harder, and more interesting work on the call-in days.  At least that’s what it looks like.  Um, already mentioned about the party, but here’s some "behind-the-scenes."  I had planned to go to three parties: A guy's, a girl's, and another guy's.  The first guy's one wasn't until 2, and I (for some unexplained reason that I don't even understand) really wanted to go to the girl's.  As I said before, I went there and stayed there.  I was having fun, too.  I want to chat w/ her again, but she's going to Albany to see an old friend that she hasn't seen in two years.  So, maybe tonight, if I'm lucky.  Oh boy.  I'm going to die early now.  Bedtime is supposed to be 12 - 1 for me, but talking to her it turns into 2-4.  I am tired.  But I wake up whenever I'm doing something interesting, and talking to her certainly counts.  She had a mouse that her mom had found with her last night.  It looked like he (Nuggets, to be precise) might not last long.  He sounded so cute!  I hope he makes it, and lives out the whole of his mouse days.  Whoa, hang on a sec... It looks like I'm going to get a new bedroom.  FREEDOM!!! My mom just told me that I need to rearrange the old tv room so that we can move a bunkbed in there for my brother and me to use!  Better get to work.  Later!
