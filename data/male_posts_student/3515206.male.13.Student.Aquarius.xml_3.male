Went To The Thai Temple In Bedok Called'Palelai Temple'... Man...It Was Filled Wif People But Not Much Of A Big Crowd... Got Some Joss Sticks And Prayed To Buddha And The Four-Faced Buddha... Went To Drop Off My Sis, Chloe To My Grandmother's To Babysit Her... Then Later, We Went Off To Singapore Expo... It was The Last Day Of The Food Exhibition... The Food Was Nice But OK... Went Back 'bout 8p.m. and Wrote This...
