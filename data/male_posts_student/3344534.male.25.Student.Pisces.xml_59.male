We call upon our governments and the United Nations to intervene immediately to protect civilians and guarantee the delivery of humanitarian aid in Darfur, Sudan.We are one human family, and each of our lives is equally valuable. The mass extermination of human beings is a crime against humanity, a crime against every person on the planet. The international community has a responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of every person. When governments prey upon their own people, the international community has a responsibility to intervene.For too long we have allowed the worst of crimes to go unchallenged. 10 years ago, international failure to stop the genocide in Rwanda shamed the world. Now, in Darfur, we must once more say ‘Never Again’ to genocide. And this time, we must mean it.  - urlLink http://www.faithfulamerica.org/darfur.htm  - urlLink http://www.darfurgenocide.org/   hmmm... what else... oh yes. blood bank blood levels are very very  urlLink low  in the US... especially in the northeast. if you aren't restricted from donating blood, please do. you can really help someone else. it only takes about an hour, filling out forms, donating blood, apple juice  cookies and a little time to stay put... and you'll be off. i don't think anything brings us together as humans like blood can. when you're in trouble and you need blood... it doesn't matter if it came from an asian, african, caucasian, mexican, russian, man or woman, newborn or elderly person, we all bleed the same thing. you never know who you'll be able to help just by setting aside and hour of your time, perhaps that pint that you gave up will be the one that gives the doctors extra time to close a suture. the above link was for new york and pennsylvania red cross donation site, here's the  urlLink link  for the national red cross site. my appointment's tomorrow @ 1:15pm.  which reminds me... i have a postcard of this one blood piece of artwork by an artist whose name i cannot think of at the moment. they made the piece in response to september 11th by using one drop of blood from volunteers on a sheet of canvas, and it captures the essence of the fact that we all bleed the same no matter where we're from or who we are. when i find the postcard... i'll scan it and post it.  my friend  urlLink outlandishjosh  is involved with  urlLink music for america and it's sub and lateral groups. they have some fun stuff @ this  urlLink link . i encourage you to check out the mfa site, as they're trying to use music to bring people together and organize as a political bloc against the re-election of bush. it's actually pretty amazing how much more the net is being leveraged for this current election. there are a host of different sites that are banding together, both for the conservatives and liberals in the country. just to think that a decade or so ago, the internet was still unavailable to most, or available only as a text based medium through gopher, usenet, and email.  this is a  urlLink blow  to grad students @ private universities. it's too bad, given that grad students usually get treated like crap anyways. i'm sure nyu is happy about this those greedy bastages... they'll be able to roll back the concessions the students won a couple years ago, while still keeping tuition @ the same level. it's not like i could afford nyu when i went there the first time... now... it's just plain impossible. i mean... wtf? isn't it pushing 40k for a year now? that's like a year's salary for someone in mid-upper middle class... and upper class in some areas of the country. even though i'm not so big on unions... i think they're needed at times, especially when fair and equitable treatment is in question.  well... that's all for now... i took a pic @ the italian fest looking down toward the east on hertel ave. i guess i have 1 more before i can develop. maybe i'll find something cool to snap a pic of tomorrow. nights.
