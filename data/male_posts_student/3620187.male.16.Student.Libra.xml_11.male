"What we do hereon earth ECHOES through eternity!"   -Maximus    ummm PS:....idk...just a little side note.......I think its pretty cool about how THE AD BANNER at the top of the page advertises stuff that i talk about in my blog....For instance, when i talkd about CHipotle....it had a little thing up there for chipotle....anyways i think that was pretty awesome....but im probably the last one to discover this phenomenon...
