The model is a 1953 Chevrolet Corvette Panamericana racecar, however, it ended up being a 1953 Chevy Corvette with engine parts from a 1954 Chevy Corvette because I didn't read the instructions.  OriginallyI planned to make it a model that looked like it just rolled off the line, but after screwing up the paint job in two spots on the driver's side, and numerous other mess ups, it became the "Mexico Badger" Panamericana racer.  I have to admit that with all the race stickers on, it does look cooler, and thanks to a couple stickers on the drivers side, I have a perfect paint job.  I plan to enter this model in a contest in Idaho next week, so I will have photos of it in competition.  If you've made it this far in the reading you are probably interested in the model cars, so here's the urlLink  link  to the kit that I built in three weeks.
