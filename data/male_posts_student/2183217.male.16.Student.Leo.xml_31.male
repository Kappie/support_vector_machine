Why didn't they fucking say something while the drivers were at it? Everything I said about this strike being gay still stands, just place the blame somewhere else now. I'm wondering if maintenance workers are harder to replace than bus drivers, or easier; if they were harder the STM would listen to them and I could take the bus home again. If they're easily replaceable maybe this strike could last a bit longer than expected. Either way, STM is kinda stupid for not running enough buses when the students need them. They should take the risk a bus breaking down and help us out. But that's just my opinion.   STM: 1, My feet: 0  P.S. Hot damn, Stoney. Learn to type!
