I might get to keep him for a weekend or something sometime.. tomorrow I am going to get my permit.. after mom gets home from work. Me and Mariah played frizbe today and me and Danielle rode bikes.  Bone-head still claims it is a girl.  I am begining to think that MAYBE MAYBE she is telling the truth this time.. but I will believe it only when I see it. I am kinda having a sad day. I think part of it has to do with the rain and stuff. but it seems that I am being put down and belittled a lot today. I know I am stupid and stuff.. but today I really feel it more.  me and mom got into a fight today again. oh well I dont care anymore. we (mom me and daddy) were talking about that lady again that let her live-in boyfriend beat and KILL her 2y/o daughter.. Daddy knows her.. she is waiting to go to trial, her bf is in jail and she is just riding around like NOTHING! pisses me off.. to think that some lady could let her bf kill her daughter and then not even care.. grrr ppl piss me off.  oh well it is just one of those days I guess.. well I am gonna go now.. ttyl ~Donna~ P.S. I am tired of people telling me how stupid I am and how worthless I am.. OK???? I know it is true but quit fucking rubbin it in!!!!!!!
