Well, except for Real Madrid who thinks that a season without the Champions League is catastrophic. Look at Vincente del Bosque who lost his job just because he failed to bring it back “home”. Actually the ambitions of a rich and a mega-rich club is different. The rich clubs like Newcastle and Liverpool want to win the league, compete for the elusive 4th spot for Champions League qualification and compete with the mega rich clubs financially. As for the mega rich clubs like Real Madrid, Manchester United, AC Milan and Bayern Munich, they will want the domestic league and the Champions league as well as to beat each other and become the world’s most supported club and the world’s richest club. Well actually who can compete with Chelesa as the world’s richest club? Even Manchester United can’t touch them financially. As for the world’s most supported club, Real Madrid and Manchester United will be fighting over that “title”. Like I said, money has always been used to buy the title but still no one has tried to buy it as quickly as Mr. Roman Abramovich who expects instant success. Look at Manchester United spending lavishly for the over rated Rio Ferdinand and Juan Sebastian Veron (who is played out of position). At least now, the rest of Europe will have to think twice before spending 20 to 30 million euros over a player. This will also teach Manchester United and other football superpowers not to be over confident that players will want to join their club. If they were willing to spend a few millions more, they would be able to get Ronaldinho who will become a contender for World Player of the Year in the near future and young Cristiano Ronaldo is not worth that amount of money and Manchester United fans, don’t say that I am jealous of you all cause I am a 100% Manchunian but I just get angry when I think that they missed on a chance to get Ronaldinho and got an inexperienced player like Cristiano Ronaldo and don’t say that he is one for the future because you all have to realize that the future is NOW if we were to compete with Chelsea and furthermore young Ronaldinho is in his early 20’s and he is also one for the future. And I hope that Manchester United will get Rivaldo so that he can mentor young Ronaldo to become just like him if not better than him. Furthermore, his experience will do us good. But even though if Chelsea were to get the title, what will happen after that? They will want to maintain that success and if they were to do that, they will have to spend more on players and increase the player’s wages to keep them on board their very own Titanic. Chelsea fans will definitely hope that Peter Kenyon will be able to help them make a profit but I see it as very difficult for it to happen and in the end, Chelsea may end up like the Titanic but I hope that that won’t happen so that I will be able to see what Mr. Abramovich has up in his wealthy sleeves.
