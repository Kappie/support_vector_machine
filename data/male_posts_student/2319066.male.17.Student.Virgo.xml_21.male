It is really boring, and I always fell like sleeping in school.  I try not ot, but it still happens.  I am happy, because freestyle has begun.  It is a lot more painful of a sport to do, but it is also a lot more fun.  There are alot of really cool moves that you can do.  You also do not have to worry about hurting the person, because in freestyle the rules are not as strict.  You can basically just throw people into the air, and not get in trouble.  It is awesome.  Well, that is all that I have for now.  See ya!
