Sprewell has been playing outstanding lately and Wally Sczerbiak can shoot lights out.  What an effort by the whole team, I applaud you T-Wolves.  Game 3 is Tuesday in L.A.  No one thinks the T-Wolves can win at the Staples Center...but I think they will definitely win!  It will be a fantastic game...one for the books...I cannot wait any longer, why can't it be Tuesday!!!!
