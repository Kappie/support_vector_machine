But anyway today was a good day for Tyke.  He and Tina talked at school as usual and that is always fun.  She's a great gal.  Then after school Tyke and Skippy just tossed around the foot in the parking lot which is a lot of fun to do.  Especially when you drill somebody's car.  OOPS!  But then Tyke came home and did a little homework and then was just so tired that he took a nap.  He ended up getting about 30 minutes in before his alarm went off for him to get up and finish his english essay.  So he got up and did that.  It was easier than he thought.  Then he left to go to Karaoke night but since he had to take care of his own dinner because it is his parents' anniversary he decided to go to JIB.  Nobody went with him but it was cool.  On the way there he heard his phone ring.  So he looked down at the ID and guess who it said?  OK, seriously guess before you look.  Done guessing?  Are ya?  Are ya?  Ok cool.  Well yeah, it was TINA!  She called him out of the blue which was wicked cool.  Like totally unexpected and this was the first time he ever called his cell.  Once, maybe twice, she called his house phone but never his cell.  It was awesome.  But she just wanted to tell him that she wasn't coming to Karaoke night like she said she was going to.  Then she asked him what he was doing and he said he was going to dinner.  So she asked who was with him and he said nobody.  Then she asked who he was meeting there and he said nobody.  And then she seemed like, "oh, ummm coool."  Oh well at least he is coooooool enough to go out to dinner on a Monday night by himself!  So HA!  But anyway they talked for a little and (*sigh, Tyke just kinda smiled just now and reminisced about that phone call) well yeah that was a really good way to start off his drive.  So after that he was in a really good mood.  He went to JIB and the service was quite slow but because he was in such a good mood he didn't mind at all.  Oh yeah, and he was listening to AAR for the night ride too so that was cool cuz he hasn't popped that CD in for a while.  But then he got to the school and called Skippy and told him about the phone call and then he went in and ate.  He talked with Haras a little and Dottie too.  Dottie is really cool.  AND SINGLE TOO (wink wink)!  So anyway the night started off with a BANGING rendition of the one and only pool table song.  Well it isn't really the only but still it is the best of them.  Haras and Purdy and Mandy and Dottie and Tig'Ol were all in it and it was very entertaining.  Mandy and Tig'Ol did another song later and that was very good too, good enough to win 1st place in fact.  But really, the show-stopping number belonged to Skippy and Tyke.  They were like, we need to do a song so they picked out one which fit them perfectly.  Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely by Backstreet Boys of course.  They pulled in a couple other guys to do it with them and it was stunning.  Tyke did a nice little strip tease as usual and basically got naked.  Well not really at all but he threw off Haras' scarf and his hat and his little jacket thing.  He poured his heart out into that song.  And he felt a good reaction came from the crowd.  Well anyway they got second place and this blog is really long so that means it is time...to...stop...writing...but it is fun to write.  But yeah, tonight was a good night.  Nothing like Sunday was.  Man, that day sucked.  Ok bye.
