I don't think this blog is sarcastic nor am I for the most part, but it sounded like a name somebody who actually knows what they're doing would give to their blog. So... Here is what I did on this very interesting day: 6:30 - Woke up - Took Shower 7:00 - Got dressed 7:02 - Searched frantically for my cool shirt that I wore today 7:03 - Found it 7:10 - Brushed teeth 7:12 - Posed in front of mirror looking tough for eight minutes or so 7:20 - Listened to music on my bed 7:29 - Realized my bus pass is expired, took two dollars from my piggy bank (AT LEAST I HAVE THE BALLS TO ADMIT I HAVE ONE!!) 7:30 - Left for my bus 7:32 - Boarded bus 7:45 - Arrived at place where I connect buses 8:05 - Connected buses 8:30 - Arrived at my destination, Tehiyah Day School  OK PAUSE FOR A SECOND... You may be bored but now is when stuff gets interesting... So keep reading!!  8:40 - Oh, deathly homeroom!! How I despise, thee... But you know what I hate more? Ms. Prowse playing stupid songs (for singing at our Graduation) on her iPod for an hour when we're not even gonna pick them... Then when we FINALLY chose the top four... She nominates "The Rainbow Song", AGAIN... And we all say no... But she persists...   9:40 -  Math class, whoopee!! Copied some things on my composition book and pretended to look interested.  10:15 - Science class, whoopee!! Thanks to the help of Nikki and Emma, I actually did something productive today... (And tieing Gatorade bottles filled with water to Eddie's backpack is definitley NOT productive...) In the middle of me doing that thing I was doing for Mr. A (I had to graph something), Emma asks me if I pluck my eyebrows. Um...  NO .  11:00 - Lunch. Ate Tomato  Rice Soup and Ritz crackers. Oh, and Oreos. Then we played Butts-Up (It's slaughter house but when someone gets out, he/she (usually he) gets on the wall andthe person who got him out gets to peg him.) Fun Fun Fun!!  11:45 - Um... Kabbalat Shabbat... Watched an excellent film on something... Nah, I'm kidding... It was really sad, actually... OH WAIT!! And we sang "I am a Latke" thanks to me!! Fucking awesome!!! Then Rachel told us a story about how she find out that Tsipi and her are  Second Cousins !!! Who would have thought??  12:30 - Physical Education... Dodgeball!! Fun Fun Fun!!  1:10 - Recess... Studied for Vocab 20 (the last one, finally!!)  1:25 - CORE = BORE!!! Took Vocab 20, got 20/20 (fits the occassion....), had Taylor dollars... Nick got one, Nikki got one, and Lucy got two. Then we watched a horrible, horrible, horrible movie on the "Music of the Civil War"... Jesus Christ!! How the FUCK is this in anyway productive to our education?!? All they did was sing "Dixie" and that song that goes "Whooorah! Whoooorah!"... And we all finally saw Ken Burns for the first time... He is younger than we imagined... And his nose kept flaring and moving all over the place when he talked.  2:50 - School is out, finally listened to music (I crip-walked in the bathroom to my rap, scaring the 5th graders).  3:00 - Boarded the bus.   3:30 - Got off at Solano with (Alphabetically by last name): Robbie, Nikki, Lucy and Ari-KH. We went to Cactus Taqueria. I got nachos for 80 cents. Then we told stupid stories about jelly beans, Safeway, Adam and other.  4:00 - Gave Nikki a CD with a song on it. Here is the URL: http://fileserv5.soundclick.com/fastg6\HiD/jewishmc+theheartsballadrevised.mp3 Nice, huh?  4:15 - Boarded bus home, listening to rap.  4:45 - Arrived home.  4:50 to 6:00 - I dunno. Too nervous.  6:15 to 7:15 - Talked to Nikki on AIM  7:15 to 7:50 - Dinner  7:50 to 9:00 - Talked to Nikki some more.  9:30 to 10:15 - Made a blog.  This concludes my day.
