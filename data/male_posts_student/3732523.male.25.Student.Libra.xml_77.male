Last time I mentioned my new iPod..now I am feeling quite guilty about it these days.  I accidently let slip that I had bought the iPod during my trip back from France for the 4th of July with a ladyfriend.  What followed was one of my greatest guilt trips of the year as she went off on me about how there was no good reason for me to buy it and how I didn't listen to anything she told me about how to better manage myself.  It was a lousy end to a great trip that included a private showing of the King Tut artifacts, a very spicy Thai dinner, early morning jogging in France, visits to 3 interesting French towns, and pizzas topped with apples and plums.  Anyways, I managed to mend things with the woman by telling her I would consult her the next time before I made such a purchase and by leaving some gummi bears on her desk at work during her lunch break.  I now realize that I do have some sort of buying addiction of technology-related items.  Those of you who have met me know how many gadgets I have and how I love to always have them about me.  The problem is I have too many of them and am always struggling to keep up with the newest ones out there.  So I gotta figure out some sort of course of action to deal with this problem.  Another interesting problem I have noticed about myself is not being able to come home before 10 pm after work.  I am now doing a break from language classes, but I still for whatever reason can not manage to get home..tonight after a bit of spodding at work, I went to the local pool hall and played a couple of games till 10pm came around..for some reason I just don't like going home......
