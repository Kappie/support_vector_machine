After school I went to Sports Plus to skate with Buchmann, Schreck, Buchmann's friend, Alan A, Eric... and Anthony T. So Buchmann almost got hooked up with this girl Stephanie from Centereach. She did a cool belly thing. Woah. This is boring. They ended up DOING NOTHING. Well... either did I. I hung out with Britt H but thats it. All these 8th graders were there from GH. I finally met Abby P after a year of talking online to her and making fun of her. She calls me an asshole because I did but why does it matter, I never even met the girl. I don't know bout you Justin but I talk to people online that I KNOW... cough indiana cough. It's cool now though, because I met them and now I don't make fun of them. ITS HOW I AM! Early bedtime for early meeting for track tomorrow morning. G nite
