I just danced with a pool cue for a guitar, through all of Devil in Jersey City, by myself . . . again. What a hot CD.  I'm excited about cheese enchiladas for lunch.  All of a sudden it's raining, with I'm excited about cheese enchiladas for lunch. urlLink sporadic  lightning. I'm going to go ahead and turn the computer off . . . after Delirium Trigger ends. . . .  And this isn't a blog merger. It's a blog marriage.
