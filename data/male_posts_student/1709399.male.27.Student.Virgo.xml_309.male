Banking  Finance has always fascinated me.Perhaps,its in the lineage considering my Dad,Uncles are all successful Bankers at Top positions.So I have taken as many finance subjects as possible with an intention of specializing in it. I intend to take a mix of Technology  Finance subjects during my coursework.Its a gamble in many ways since I am pretty new to hard core finance (My knowledge of Finance is limited to Business magazines,books  stock market gossips ! ).                         But then having spent most of my life at knowing " what I am not good at " I think there is no harm is testing " what I am good at" :-)
