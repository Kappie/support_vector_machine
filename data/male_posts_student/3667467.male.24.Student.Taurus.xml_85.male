I had to provide a whole bunch of information about where I lived, the address of the Subway I went to, blah blah blah, but I still did it! Woo! Here's my letter:   You guys are great! I would eat your subs three times a day if I could. Seriously! I had the Chicken Teriyaki today and the Italian B.M.T. the day before. They really hit the spot! I'm going to try some of the other sandwiches to see which one I like the best. The best thing about your subs is that they're big but they're fresh and light, so I can enjoy a foot-long but not feel too full afterwards. Friendly help, too! Keep up the good work!  P.S. The cookies are good, too!   I heart Subway!
