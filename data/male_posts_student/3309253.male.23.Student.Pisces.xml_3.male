This is not the matrix.  This is the United States, and we are going for a road trip.  From May 15th to May 20th, Sam, Sameer, Gaurav and yours truly (is Hiten also Coming?) , a gang of  desi  (what Indians in the US call themselves) grad students, are going for a trip to the  urlLink Zion National Park  in Utah and  urlLink Lake Havasu City  in Arizona.  So, what does this mean for you, the reader?  This means a lot of  photographs  which I will have to share once we are over with the trip. We are really excited about this and have bought a tent and a propane stove also. Sameer can't stop thinking about the Buick he will get to drive :D.  Well then, back to work.... Cheers -A
