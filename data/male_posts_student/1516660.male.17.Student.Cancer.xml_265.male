Spoil the whole flavour of the laksa!! ERGH!! Worse of all is hor, my mother told her not to put the leaves inside, but she ignored my mother. Even when my mother complained about it hor, she still ignored my mom. WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS? Idiot leh! I told my mother hor, don't pay until the food is ready. If that idiot adds leaves, I told my mother to just walk off and don't pay. Come on lor. I wanted a specific kind of laka, and I am paying for it. If the vendor is not going to give me that, then I am not paying for it. Spoil the morning!!! After eating breakfast, I watched TV lor.   After lunch and HZGG, I slept a little. Lazy pig. HaHa. After waking up, I decided to play this new online game called Priston Tale. HaHa. As usual, I became a magician. In any game, I would not become anything except something in the magic line. HaHa. :D I played for some 3 hours, until I levelled up to level 3. HaHa. Oh well.  I came online for an hour, then went down to buy dinner for me and brother. We ate dinner and watched TV at the same time. Then I bathed and tada, I am here.   HaHa. I am like, so nothing to write one. HaHa. But rest assured, tomorrow will be filled with lotsa things. Oh, I cna't promise that, but it would be longer lor. HaHa. Tomorrow I am going out ma. HaHa.  Therefore, I am ending this liao. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
