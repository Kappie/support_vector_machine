Anyways, I am treading in dangerous waters....I have been spending alot of time in the vast wasteland that is BlackPlanet....and get this...there was actually an intelligent conversation today....I couldn't believe it....  Oh and I happened to run into this girl who I took a class at Spelman with in the chat room....I remember thinking she was really cute.....but she was also really smart and well....to put it nicely I tricked off that class....I was surprised she remembered me before I put it together who she was....hmmm.....hopefully it wasn't an isolated incident....  Anyways back to the greatest Mini-series ever....
