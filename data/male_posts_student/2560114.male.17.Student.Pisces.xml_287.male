The 2 teams we lost to were pretty damn good, but we could of beatin one of them though. Jon and Buck got, i think, 5th overall, which is not that bad, but Jon said he could of done better wit Curtis. It was freakin hot at Manhattan though, i could barely walk cuz the sand was like steppin on fire like in fear factor or somethin, hehe. Today i went to best buy and i got the spiderman 2 soundtrack that recently came out afew weeks ago. So far, it's really good cuz most of the bands i like (Dashboard Confessional, Yellowcard, Hoobastank, etc.) are in this album...so i'm glad that i bought it. Well i'm not sure if me and david are gonna compete in the beach j.o.'s cuz i think that we're too late to submit the money and the form to compete cuz on the site it said that it was due on the 20th, but when david registered it said that it was due on the 16th...2 days ago. So i'm not sure whats goin on right now. This week, or next week or w/e, i'm goin to make a vball recruitment video so that alfred could give it to the coach at the university of hawaii to see, so that i can have a chance at playing in hawaii...which would b totally awesome. And this friday it will b 1 month since i asked stephanie to b my g/f...=)...but its tuff cuz we don't get to see each other that much cuz school is out...so school bein out can work as a negetive and a positive...o the irony. But yeah...crazyness...payce out folkz.
