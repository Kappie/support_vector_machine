She was something to live for, but what do you do when the one you love the most, loves another the way you love her. I decided to leave; well I didn’t have much of a choice didn’t I? Told her I’d stand by her side. She said she needs me to be with her as a friend. Does she, when she’d have all that she wants by her side? I will always be by her side, always have since the day I met her. I couldn't leave even if i wanted to. She’s got real friends, real people, people who matter, I not among those people who’d matter. It wouldn’t matter if I pass away, I won’t be missed.    I guess this is my measure about how many lives you have touched and made a difference, I haven’t touched or made a difference in anyone’s life. I’m afraid, I guess I’m still looking for some one to come and save me. In a way I was sure that it was her. It’s not something you can blame, it’s not something that you can point a finger on and say that was the reason it didn’t work out. All I’d say that it’s my fault; I fell for her she didn’t for me.    I guess now that I always say that I’m back to the way I was, everyone’s gonna be happy. Can I really be like the person I was? It isn’t easy bolting up your feelings inside and keeping them there, those last few happy memories for you know that you wont have anymore of those, no matter how much you want to have more.     Is this the end?  So we now part as friends  You said you need in your life for ever as a friend  We will meet some day if things don’t go your way  I pray that we don’t meet, for you I pray  I wanted to travel though medieval cities  Watch setting suns, and the frosty ice lands  Lush treed forests, holding you in my hands  But this is the end where we part as friends
