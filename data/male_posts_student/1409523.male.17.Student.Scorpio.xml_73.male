(look to the past entry to see how i feel when im depressed)... so anyways... in other news... other things are fucked up too... mainly... relationships... first of all... i am kind of feeling like a refugee ... im sort of in between friend groups now... the older group doesn't call me... but im kind of distancing myself from the younger group... which is for personal and nonpersonal reasons.... but besides that other relationships seem to be faltering... all i want is to fix things and go back to square one... but i don't know if thats possible now... i hope so ... i really hope so.... ill write more later  -Nate
