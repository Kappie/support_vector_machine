In fact, my top preference would be to split the summer -- 5 weeks at the law firm, and 5 weeks at the taco shack.  My favorite kind of law is corporate litigation, and my favorite taco filling is spicy chicken with a green tomatillo salsa.  I have significant experience doing legal research, writing memos, and re-frying beans.  In fact, I'm a member of Harvard's Corporate Law Journal, and I eat at Anna's Taqueria at least twice a week.  I am a skilled negotiator, analyst, and vegetable chopper -- and have experience with Lexis-Nexis, Westlaw, and both whole wheat and corn tortillas.  I'll be in New York over Christmas, interviewing at law firms and taco emporiums throughout the city.  I would love to come in for an interview, armed with a resume and an apron.  I will call you next week to follow up.
