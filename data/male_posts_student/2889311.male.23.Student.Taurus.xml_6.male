When the clock struck 7:00 he was in his car waving good bye to his beloved and thinking about the tasks on hand for the day. His mind was racing from one thought to another thinking about the appointments for the day, the negotiations which beckoned him, the proposals nearing completion, the backlogs, the blockheads in the topnotch who grappled to comprehend his brilliant ideas, the bills to be paid, ......  This was his usual train of thoughts every morning when heading to his office, Sometimes he was intimidated by the daunting tasks that lay ahead of him, he knew his success heavily rested on the topnotch who had the final say in putting into action his splendid ideas and this made him feel highly insecure, because he knew that most of his superiors despised him, they were taken aback by his feverish pace and his fervor towards his work. In the past they had snubbed his exciting ideas as dubious because they felt his success would wreck their stakes. He had always regarded his work place as a shrine and his work as bliss through which he escaped the ills of the world around him.  A magnificent carving stood overlooking the entrance of his office building, it was a sculpture of the city builder. He had read about him and he admired his spirit for he had always loved the way in which the sprawling city was laid out. The streaks of sunlight behind the head of the statue was a marvelous sight and it always brought tranquility to him, that sight will cast aside all his jitters and will set his mind in tone to face the gruelling day. That statue was his symbol of worship. When he turned to catch a glimpse of that captivating structure today, a thunderbolt struck him, for he stared directly at the sun, he felt a sudden panic running through his body and he immediately recollected that he read in last week's newspaper that the statue was about to be removed to overhaul its rusty podium. He felt awkward and a light dizziness set in, circumspect about what the day holds in store for him, he escalated in the elevator and proceeded to enter his office.  The day, which began with a jolt started to slide from bad to worse. By afternoon it was pretty obvious to him that his future looked bleak in a place where he had worked his heart out enduring every moment's pain with a hope of devouring a sweet success, which he thought nobody could deny him. He had underestimated the influence of the lobby, which was constantly increasing in number as more and more people felt threatened by his aura. Some of his friends had warned him about this, but he had brushed aside their fears and told them that nothing terrible can happen as an offshoot of his industrious attitude. But today he was shattered by the horrible turn of things, his sympathizers spoke with their eyes and seemed to convey that they were concerned at his plight. The visage of his detractors were mocking and they had eagerly awaited this day for a long time now. He could not take the disgrace dished at him as a reward for his monumental efforts and after a few minutes of thought by the day fall he decided that this place does not deserve his caliber. He met the concerned people and completed the formalities and he was ready to go once and for all.  On his way back home, he was caught in rush hour traffic. He tried not to think of what happened during the day, but he was unable to control his thoughts. His mind kept racing back to the missing statue and how it served as an omen for the beleaguered day.  He felt that there was no justice in this world, for all that he had done was pulverized by some incompetent people who were scared to face the world face up. He rued the fact that all his excruciating endeavors bore no fruit and the future looked bleak. He did not know what to do to redeem himself for the mistake which was not his. He was fighting tears, the traffic and the endless wait made him even more miserable. He did not know how to present what had happened today to his beloved. He was distraught with grief when he thought about how she might react to the situation.   He reached home and was determined not to reveal that he was shattered. She had returned tired from the day's work, after fixing dinner she was eagerly awaiting him. He entered his dwelling and tried to look at ease. She saw his grim face and immediately realized that something terrible has happened. He tried not to look into her eyes but her presence was pervasive and he couldn't escape the concern on her face. She walked up to him and hugged him, she felt cushy in her night robe and a sudden stab of emotion hit him on hugging her and he moved back and rushed into his room. He sat on the bed with his face turned away from the door, trying not to reveal his tears to her. She followed him into the room, with her heart beating fast, she turned his face towards her and to her shock, she saw tears rolling across his face. She softly ran her fingers across his hair and urged him to speak out. He buried his face into her chest and started to sob inconsolably. She held him tight and tears started to roll down her face, she dint know why he was thrown in harm's way, but she just couldn't stand him breaking down and sobbing like a child. Taking refuge in the warmth of her breasts and inhaling her sweet fragrance, he wailfully recounted how everything he stood for was demolished on this fateful day. She dint speak, she let him pour out all that has been bothering him.  After he spoke his heart out, she gently kissed on his forehead. He felt tranquilized, revitalized, and recharged. He gathered himself up, kissed her as a token of appreciation and felt he was ready to face anything that this cruel world can hurl at him, for he knew that he could always fall back on her.
