I know if I was not doing this blog and actually writing in my journal, I would print the email out and tape it to the pages. So on that note... here is my friend's email with some editing of course. (I will aslo post how and why I became active during the course of the weekend.)    Shemon:   I'm sure we will speak soon about political matters relatively but let Me express some personal thoughts for now. Thank you so much for attending theconference. It impressed me very much how in short notice you took that long train ride to Rochester. It meant more to me than you could ever know. I did not want to leave you there so early. I wish we could have waited all day till nightfall and kept you company until your departure.    I know you have had a very difficult year with your mom passing and separating from your girlfriend *****. Such a year would make most folks go to pieces to the point of retreating from new friendships and commitments. Your strength under adversity has reassured me in a very difficult period for myself, that my own commitments have not been in vain. And for that I wish you a thousand virgins AND a can opener (smile).    ****â€™s trials and tribulations has always been a cautionary tale. From the anxiety of growing old , single, and poor to the need to solidify my long term economic and relationship prospects without compromising my own political commitments, he's been my Yoda in many regards. My friend ***** in London has been another personal oracle. I previoulsy have seen him slip into mental illness (no exaggeration) as a result of his partner separating from him and listened to him renounce every political commitment he every made as if being toasted in the flames of hell. Consequently despite complaints I have been bearing witness learning greater and greater pyschological, sexual and economic discipline for a world however small I hope to midwife with some special people.    I have tolerated being toasted in the flames by **** (hopefully I can go on being extra kripsy after she has finally declared "oops") and academia a very long time as a result of bearing witness to these elders. I always listen and have patience for my political elders and break with them only under involuntary conditions.    But please remember, contra your previous assertion, I am not YOUR elder, but of YOUR political generation. We shall rise and fall together in the same peer group. Your forceful voice of passion and poetry and political brilliance leave me no doubt. I have been convinced that a community without your kindness and integrity would be a much degraded place without you. Whatever I could possibly teach you, it is you who continue to illuminate aspects of a better place which I really want to be a part. Thank you beloved. I'll continue to do my best to be worthy of such a fine neighbor in our block party of the future.    And after a short pause for the cause now back to our regularly scheduled rants...
