I'd like to retract my statements and say.*ahem* I am no more interesting then anybody reading this. In Fact in Interestingness levels you're kicking my proverbial ass.Thank you, Now you may continue to my new Blog entry.  Welcome the whole new pain. Of A new school year. It's close who cares, Let's move on. Vacations sucked this year, I've only been home 5 days in the past 5 weeks So It's good to be back. I don't have much to say right now cause it sucked and I don't feel like boring you as of right now. I'll just wrap this up with PLease, for the love of god, Everybody take a few minutes of your day and Listen to Drowning Lessons by My Chemical Romance and Failure By Designer Jeans by From First to Last. Thats it, I'm out for now.
