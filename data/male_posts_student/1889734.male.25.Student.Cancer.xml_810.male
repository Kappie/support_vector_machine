North America as a whole saw growth in high-net-worth individuals of 13.5 percent and Asia 8.4 percent. In China, which saw surging economic growth last year, the number of high-net-worth individuals rose 12 percent and India 22 percent. Europe showed a more modest increase, with the number of millionaires up 2.4 percent to 2.6 million. �That partly can be attributed to the more restrictive European income-tax policies which impeded personal wealth accumulation,� the report said."  Who wants to live in Europe?  They are driving their money away!
