I'm writing from an internet cafe (apparently a small room with two computers constitutes an internet cafe in Africa) at Dar es Salaam International Airport.  We have a seven-hour layover here between our flight from Zanzibar and our flight to Zurich (then, obviously, there'll be a flight to Boston).  I'm excited that Kerry chose Edwards, the most electable vice-presidential candidaate, but I feel somewhat behind the times since I only learned such last night and I don't know how long ago it happened.  Edwards complements Kerry well-- he's a Southerner, Kerry's a New Englander; he's charismatic, Kerry's rigid; he has influence in a lot of the swing states, Kerry has power more among registered Democrats than independents.  I'm also happy to be returning home, for evident reasons into which I don't feel like going right now.  I may choose to transcribe my traveling journal here; we'll see about that.  Yesterday I wrote a rap about the trip; I might transcribe that also.  But that's it for now.  Talk to you all tomorrow!
