Got loads of tut to complete, and lot of readin up to do. hd some problems with registration, i have dropped HR but it seems that the staff from IRU said that the max subject I can take is 4? If that's the case, i woul d have to drop DSP ( it's not that interesting). But that would means that I have to overload when I return.  Had warm homecooked food when I reached home late last evening. so great to have homecooked food ya. My housemates and I will take turns to cook. I would say all of us are great cooks. Not much recipes to share, we just add what we think will turn out nice and most of the time it did. Haah, Weixiang suggested that we start a recipe book of what we cook and pass it down to the next tenant. Yesterday chef was WX, fabulous food. Think I will be cooking next Tuesday. I would try to cook up some nice food, this time it will be a treat from me.( will pay for the grocery)  Supposed to meet up with yun, but kept getting a dead tone. Aiyo, like that how to contact her? Hope to see her at SSS gathering tonight. Hmm.. what is SSS? I also don't know. I only know there's a meet the international student from 6-9pm tonight at QUT. My lecture ends at 8pm, and i'm not sure if there is lab. See how it goes la, will contact WengChuan because he says he'll be going.  Alrighty, time to hit the books. Ciaoz.
