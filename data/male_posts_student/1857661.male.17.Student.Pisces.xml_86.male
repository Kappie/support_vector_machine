Told you that I have to buy lots of stuff. A little bit of disappointment, but still I feel happy as I bought quite a lot of stuff with the tight budget. At 9.20p.m., I found myself in the cinema with my sister and her boyfriend, watching  Three of A Kind , a canto movie. The movie's not bad, I'll give it a 6.5/10.
