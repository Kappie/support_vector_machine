       
      I have two main genres in which I read in, Science fiction and Fantasy. Also smatterings of post 19th century classics are read from time to time. Currently I am reading much more Science Fiction than any other genre, mainly because I find it to be a more approachable and non repetative.  I also subscribe to the New Scientist magazine. I really do like my science, both fictional and real.  Currently I am reading the following books:  Fiction: all sci fi except for Good Omens  Good Omens (Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman) Beyond Lies the Wub: The collected stories of Phillip K. Dick A Scanner Darkly (Phillip K. Dick) Black Beauty, according to Spike Mulligan Roma eterna (Robert Silverberg)  Non fiction  The universe in A nutshell (Stephen Hawking) Social History of England (G.M Trevelyan, O.M)  I am obviously not reading all these books at once and kind of just read whatever suits me. From this one can see a strong liking for science fiction. I will probably finish these books in the next few weeks.
