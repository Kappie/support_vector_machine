And further more Miss Ang was so damn BITCHY during the Chinese lesson with her kp here kp there. ((Oh never mind...most JC teachers are bitchy..especially Econs tutor-bitch Miss Aminah~~! =/)) Wahaha...I'm so bad...being such a person of sarcasm too~~~!!  So much maths to do....who cares about it? It's just some A level subject that you need to pass so that many doors of university of courses will open to you upon passing this subject but it's so darn difficult too! I rather summon a golden key to open all doors to university courses and pick the one I like the best. ((Wonder why there isn't really a history course in university? Seems like similar courses only exists overseas such as being a curator at London Museum??? =O ))  And suda~~~~so much work to be done...especially Chinese AO.....and I don't wanna drop until I'm dead. That's my key idea to maintaining four A levels subjects, and I WILL score for all of them~~~!! Plus it can prove all the teachers' bad opinion about me!!! *Sigh* I miss my SRJC era friends + tutors...they are so nice~~~~compared to the tutors here where most are merciless etc. ((Even my Chinese tutor's better than Miss Ang~~! Although she did looked a bit odd...))   Never mind...what's done cannot be undone. Perhaps the only thing I can look forward to is to just study and study...BUT I HAVE NO CCA~~!!!! *Sob Sob* Maybe I won't go to university after all with no CCA....and looks like Meijiao's giving the I-want-to-sue-you look again at me when I told her I wanted to try out the Biology club. Plus she gave out the Join-the-bio-club-with-me-over-my-dead-body look as well. I wonder how does she give such looks that makes her super 'kiam-pah'. Never mind about that Lina no.2....I can't be bothered with such people who likes to biased against others.  The time now? 12.23 am....ticking away on Wednesday 7 July CE 2004. ((Why don't I use Anno Domino? 'Cause it's unfair to non-Christians though my entry title has Christian and medieval influence in  it. Hey! I'm beginnin' to sound like Ownself-answer-questions Mr. Leong Choon Fatt! This is so shocking~~~!!))  Okay...enough of my bitching plus slutty entry. Time to get going on my Chinese assignment...AU~~ REVOIR~~~!!!! (I'm so FRENCH now!) ((Plus the bonnets  tea as well!))
