I went to church today and we had our Chinese New Years service which was really nice since we had a group called 1AChord comeand sing for us. We also had a special number from the orchestra, which i was in. Also, PTL because my Grandfather got saved after the service and we were all really happy for him. For the longest time he wouldnt listen to my parents or my Grandma when they tried to talk to him, but one day we asked him to come and he came! I would like to praise the Lord for allowing this to happen and i pray that he will open up the hearts of all the rest of my unsaved family members.
