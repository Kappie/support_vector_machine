Bwah, it's General Psychology anyway, and it is not really difficult.  But imagine getting higher grades than Dacasin....  HAHAHAHA!!!!   And, for the first time, I had a line of nine in HISTORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Well, kasi naman midterm pa lang.  Check the finals and we'll see why I am distressed all the time.  I HATE DOUBTING MYSELF!!!  I have doubted everything: God, the world, sciences, all claims, all that was said, all left unsaid...  EVERYTHING EXCEPT EXISTENCE!  And that's only MY existence!!!  Why am I now doubting my superior capacity????    Wala, mayabang na.
