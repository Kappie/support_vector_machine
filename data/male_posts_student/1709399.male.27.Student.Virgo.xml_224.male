The Raj path (Road leading to Rashtrapathi Bhavan) was beautiful with lush grass on the sides and fountains . We walked across the North Block  South Block (the power centres of Finance  external affairs) and right upto the Rashtrapathi Bhavan Main Gate . Its imposing  serene on a sunday evening and the Gardens near the Fountains are a great place to rest and soak in some Indian political Nostalgia.                           We also visited the India Habitat centre in Lodhi Road which is the melting pot of Art  culture. Photo exhibitions,paintings,parallel/world cinema,theatre - Its a paradise for art lovers. It has a well-equipped library with a great collection of Books,magazines,CD-ROMs  DVDs. Nice place .
