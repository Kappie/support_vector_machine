I have nobody to talk to; not even Dominique. I am tryingmy hardest to turn to God and I know He's hearing me, but it doesn't feel like it. I am in a state of remorse so badly that only God can help now, but it would be nice to know I have some friends who will back me up. Right now, it feels like I have nothing.    Right now I do not know what to do and wish I had some guidance. Apparently I didn't do something right and a friend of mine got upset at me. I don't know what I did or what they feel like right now, but I wish that friend would just talk to me. I pray for this friend almost every night and I know that they are going through some rough times. I just wish I could do more.
