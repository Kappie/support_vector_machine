Teen advocates of this proposal argue that they deserve the right to vote, as working teens pay taxes and are directly affected by school budget cuts. Shouldn't they get to decide where their money goes? Opponents argue that the average teen isn't responsible enough to vote and worry over the logistical and ethical problems of giving out partial votes.  I can personally attest that the average teenager I meet while walking around school is not ready to vote. Teens, on average, are not that well-informed of current events and wouldn't be able to make informed decisions. Case in point: American Idol. It was probably because of the votes of thousands of 14-18 year olds that losers who couldn't sing continued in the competition. Does this mean that politicians who can't balance budgets or write legislation will receive teen votes just because they act  cool  on camera? Probably. Most teens would only duplicate their parents vote anyways. Teens who do want to have a voice in politics can do so without voting.
