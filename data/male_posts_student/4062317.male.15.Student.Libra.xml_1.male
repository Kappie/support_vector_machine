The cg of the robots was fantastic all the animations were sooo realistic. The whole story played out so well that you couldn't tell who the villian in the story was until the end. I was told this was a good movie by one of my friend I saw bourne with the other day and he was right.  For those who don't know I Robot is a story about one man who doesnt trust robots even though everyone says he is crazy. The robots follow three laws:      A robot cannot hurt a human being     Robots must do what they are commanded to do unless this violates the first law     A robot must protect itself from harm unless it violates the first or second law    Civilization believes that these laws will protect them but obviously they are wrong. If i say anymore i will ruin the movie.  Anyways I would rank this movie a 9/10.  Lates,  Smog  Thanks to Drew for telling advising me to go to the movie and Yuiichi for helping me with some computer stuff.
