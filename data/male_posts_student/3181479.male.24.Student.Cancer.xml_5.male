I got the impression that Josh and Guillermo were both pretty trashed.  Anyway, here are the pictures.     urlLink Josh and Guillermo.     urlLink Josh, Laura, and Guillermo's head, all standing right in front of the women's restroom.     urlLink Josh, Laura, and some guy whose name I can't remember.     urlLink Yours truly.     urlLink One of Josh's paintings.     urlLink A Toyota Scion that was parked outside.
