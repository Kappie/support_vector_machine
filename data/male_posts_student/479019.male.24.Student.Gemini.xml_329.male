I get to go to another class in a few minutes... oh joy! I don't think my body likes being awake... it's used to be idle...  Anyway I realized why I didn't  Monster's Ball  was that great. Leticia was too weak of a character... needing Hank to make her feel good and take care of her. Now I realize that her situation was absolutely horrible and weakness is understandable; however, I think that her lack of strength and dependence on Hank made her less interesting of a character. Hank was certainly much of interesting of a character and all through the movie... I was questioning if he was necessarily in love with Leticia or was simply caught up in his own emotions... or even sense of connectedness to Leticia. That's just a thought.  I wonder if I should buy myself a coffee for class... I feel like I could use it / one.  **
