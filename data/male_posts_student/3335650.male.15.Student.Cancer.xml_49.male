Yesterday's excuse for not posting, was that I had school, after which I had, like, 10 people at my house... and then I was performing a midsummer nights bad dream. After that, I went to a party at a friend's house, which was good, except for the fact that I ended up miles from home with 50p in my pocket and a dead phone battery. Not so good. Party was pretty cool, it was just people in my class. Eppie was due to leave early anyway 'cos she buggered her back up (fell over badly, or something) and as a result of that didn't feel up to sleeping in a bus shelter, or wherever she might otherwise end up sleeping (probably a solid wooden floor, i.e. not good for backs). Anyway, Eppie went at about 12ish. In the end, Adrian went with her *cue wolf-whistles ;-)* because he was "hmm... *yawn* oh fork off, i iz tired innit!" Still not sure what happened to him, I expect he went to sleep at her house.  Everyone else stayed through the night, which is unusual as someone always seems to become rather ill... too much *ahem-teacher-might-be-reading* ribena =) Ruby  almost  had too much, let's just say I ended up virtually carrying her down the road :lol: I'll leave the descriptions of the party there, I don't want to be questioned at school. For once, it was a party where no-one regretted anything, except for maybe too much ribena... maybe we're growing up (what the hell? I like being young and care-free!!) Early this morning me, Martin and Ben set off to Copmanthorpe (where i got stranded) to go to Ben's house. Martin very kindly lent me some money for the bus. Thanks mate! We met some rather scary people, the boys were quite safe, but one of the girls kept trying to find worms to eat, which even I found a touch disturbing. Still quite funny =) Martin and I missed the bus from Copmanthorpe, but the slightly disturbed worm eating girl told us where to get the bus from. ThanQ! I did   eventually   get back to York, with no money, a dead phone which, even if it had been charged, had no credit on it, and I also had wet trousers. And no I didn't wet myself, it was dew. My fault for running through a field at 1AM =). At least I had a used bus ticket, which, curiously enough, smelt of lemon, because a certain company have launched a lemon flavoured version of their chocolate bar and some bright spark had the idea of spraying smelly yellow stuff on the back of the bus ticket as advertising. Anyways, I was standing at the station, sniffing my ticket, wondering how I was going to get back home. In the end I got on this ancient bus only to find that a) it was empty and b) someone I knew drove it, and he let me on for free. Nice one! There then followed a lengthy conversation about whether Glastonbury, or The Download Festival were better. Interesting stuff! At least I thought it was. I then did my paper round with a head-ache and sore legs and feet (I'd been standing ALL day!)  Once I got home I had bbqd dinner, which was nice but tasted a touch of petrol... My step-dad has "original" cooking skills ;) Then I had a bath and  then  I sat down and wrote this!  I'll see you later, blog!  LoZ
