I cna apply. The bad side of it...sucks! Firstly, I am worried that the application might be rejected. Some idiotic people will stick rule-by-rule and will reject your application even though it's NOT your fault that you can't submit on time (some worse ones will think I had forgotten and is making up excuses). I should either scream at them, or refer them to MOE. Or both. Second bad news is that I might not be confirmed. You see ar, the letter said that confirmations letter are given out by December. This is already late LATE December (don't try to argue and say it's early. 1/3 of a month has passed, and it's late!). They might have already printed the confirmation letters and in the process of sending them out. Or worse!!! They could hace printed out the cheques already!! OH MY GOD!! THERE GOES MY $250!! All the MOE's fault! All the post office's fault!!! If either one of the two bad things I predicted happened, I will call the New Paper and give them a story (I can imagine the headline.  No Administration Loses Student $250 ). Or write to Straits Time to complain. Or both. Whatever!! I want my $250!!!!  Okay. Darn, I am not gonna relax until I get my confirmation letter. ... Okay. Let me fill in what happened today.   Today, we (Me, Ben, EC and HM) met at 1015 to buy present for Melvin. I am meeting Ben at 1000. Well, it turned out that he was sleeping till I called. I had to wait for him to finish bathing. Sigh!! It ended up us being late for eight minutes. Oh boy. The girls were pissed. It was not my fault anyway. HaHa.  We went around Causeway looking for Mel's present. We found it at Metro, at the toy's section. It was c ehss board, with the pieces made out of crystal-plastic thingy. Whatever. Heh heh. We chose that after much deliberation. Hmm....a sales assistant came over to us (more like ran) and pasted a label there, saying it was the price tag. Ha! I know different. That was her own personal tag!! She's earning commission for something which she didn't help the customer to choose. I peered at the label and saw the name Chan Hse May. Maybe Wendy knows her (Do you? Same department right?). That's not a good sales assistant, to earn something that she didn't even work for. I guess she needs the money for her family or something. So, sigh. Let it go la.  After that, we made our way to Melvin's house. We were amazed by the amound of food he prepared. He told us to eat first, and his friends will eat after we do (he's also inviting his school friends ma). We ate his macroroni with pasta. It was nice, if it wasn't for the sore underside my tongue (that sore is so painful! ergh!). It was sensitive to sauces, so I can't eat much. We ate other finger foods too, like fishball and fish nuggets.   After that, we watched and sang to Karaoke. Heh Heh. We watched his friends slowly filter in. After watching Karaoke (and some sleep on my part), they turned to watched a horror movie. I took out my book to read. I hate horror movies....eeee.... However, it was not as scary as The Park. That's good, to some extent.  After that, we milled around waiting for the cake-cutting ceremony. HM and EC played a few piano pieces. Wonderfully done! The cake-cutting ceremony was crowded. HaHaHa. We ate some cake. Heh Heh. After that, at 5, we left. Getting kinda late le.  We walked from his house to Woodlands MRT. Me and Ben took the 913 bus back. sigh...I was in shock when I receieved the 'sword'. Sigh...I needa stop worrying. Cannot don't worry.... Sigh...  Hmm...I think I should stop le la. See ya later. Night blog!
