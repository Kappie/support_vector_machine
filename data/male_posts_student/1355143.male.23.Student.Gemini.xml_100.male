Then you have 12 years of school before heading off to Uni (assuming you pass each grade in 1 year...some people need more than that--they ride the short bus to school). Grades K (kindergarten) through 5 are generally called primary, elementary, or grade school, depending on where you're at in the country. Then grades 6-8 are called middle school or junior high, unless your junior high happens to be grades 7-9 and your grade school happens to be grades K-6. Or, if you go to parochial (Catholic) school, you usually go to the same school for grades K-8, which in Chicago we call grammar school. I don't know what they call it elsewhere. Then it's off to high school, which nowadays is usually grades 9-12, often called freshman (9), sophomore (10), junior (11), and senior (12). Many high schools used to be only grades 10-12, and some specialty schools still are, like the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy. Then, after high school, it's off too Uni, which we usually call college. College years are usually referred to as freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior just like high school. This is the undergraduate curriculum. Then, if you so choose, there is graduate school. This would be like the 5th year at ESADE, but it is generally longer than 1 year, and you can earn a Master's degree, or a doctorate if you study longer. So you see, it's really quite simple. The system pretty much runs like this everywhere in the country, though they might have different names for some of the schools. Got it? Well, back to work with me. Please post any and all questions concerning the above system :)  Tim
