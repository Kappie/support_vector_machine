Trying to get her to sleep, sans aunt...   I sorta went "Isn't it your bed time now?"   And before I even got to "time" her eyes had filled with tears...   I had totalk nicely for about 10 minutes for herto calm down...   Yes... contrary to popular belief, it IS possible for me to be nice...   Thankfully, Aunt and Uncle arrived back, taking the whole thing off my hands,   That's one of the few times I get to say "whole thing" as opposed to "whole mess"   :D   Hmm   It appears Iwill be on a road trip this weekend, so I probably won't post,   Then again, Uncle might get another of his emergency meetings :/   I've been told that Uncle is a mad driver...   It'll be interesting to compare him with my mum, who currently holds my record for most death defying traffic stunt...   That's another story for another day...  Meh...
