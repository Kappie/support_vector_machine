A train that circles dublin.  I hope this is it cuz then I can go to dublin town center whenever I can bike to the Luas Line.   I already hate this hotel I can't wait to get out. All there is to do is computer and run on a treadmill downstairs.  I want out ACK!  Brother still being....a brother....buggy as usual....any way.  hope my stuff gets here soon. I want to go biking.      Sorry i didnt post yesterday but the internet was out for the last 24 hrs. So that sucked.  peace
