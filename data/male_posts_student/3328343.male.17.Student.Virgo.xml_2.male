Anyway I decided on getting the full metal Baretta M9 pistol along with a sweet leg holster. Turns out I forgot to make my payment to Redwolf for that metal body so they canceled my order. So instead of the body I got the gun, wanna fight about it?   No school tomorrow on account of a shooting rumor, isn't society grand? That means 2 3 day weekends in a row! Celebration time! Wooo Wooo!  Yeah
