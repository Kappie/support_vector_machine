Our puppy is starting to seem like the surdery (an expensive one!) didn't do much, so our puppy (Freya) might not last in our house. This means that she's might be heading back to live in the breeder's house...   The other big problem is  urlLink Elvorix  isn't around therefore I can't borrow his Dragonlance books (these are the best books on the planet FYI)  well, bye
