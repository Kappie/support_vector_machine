I hope to update quite often, at least once a week but when my exams finish you will feel the strangely nice glow that is the glory of a blog by me, no ego of course. I hope to get some sanity of mind through this, but from the outside it might seem other wise (because I am giving you my insanity buwa ha ha ha!) sobare with me because all will become clear...  (Edit: This, ive decided, is such a great introduction to my blog that it will live on forever at the top of the page in my description)   If you dont know already I am moderating for a really cool forum at http://www.corrupt-system.net but at the moment i am doing the extreme sports sections and well this isn't really my style: as i dont actually do any extreme sports but i am an interested watcher and am an avid fan of all those extreme sports that are a little bit different, see the forum for next weeks review on extreme ironing! Also every fiday I am going to show a true fanaticism of mine off: my love for all things interweb so tune in for the greatest timewasting,funny, interesting or downright laugh your pants stuff from this weeks internet.  If i can get some good comments about my friday roundup it might even persuade demby to get a section on corrupt: nudge nudge wink wink. Well back to the grindstone but more to come soon. Promise
