Honors seem to have the same or lower work level as Curriculum I had last year.  Outside of academia, TV's been pretty good.  The Conan O'Brien 10th Anniversary Special is on in a few hours.  It's a clip show, but it still might be funny.  The OC is always new and good on Tuesdays, and a lot of the great shows, like ER, the West Wing, Law and Order, etc., will be premiering this week.  Next weekend, I plan to see "American Splendor," and the weekend after, "Luther."  Anyone who wants to come is welcome.  Two good quotes were said this week:  "Anything I write on the board, you should probably write on the board." – Ms. Rossman, my TV Production teacher  "For example, the Sun is many millions of light years away from the Earth..." – Ms. Srikanth, my Chemistry teacher  That's all for now.  Check back next Sunday.
