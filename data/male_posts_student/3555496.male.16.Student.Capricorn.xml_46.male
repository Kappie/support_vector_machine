But $1.60 + .60¢ = $2.20 TIM!"  apparently the woman working the register wasn't qualified enough to operate it properly. just goes to show you how much skool should be first in your life. well, i'm not complaining. you girls out there that spend lots of mula can learn a thing or two about saving money from  urlLink this guy .  and BAM i'm back at the razo mansion. razo's crackin' the whip, telling me to fix his damn computer. and since i'm not looking to hurt the guy, i do as i'm told. so we watch the Reel Big Fish DVD to pass the time it took me to kick his computer's ass. whooo it took longer than i thought; that mofo was on all night updating as slow as hell and stupid me i'm right behind it making sure it's okay for the  entire  night while razo caught up on his beauty sleep. that's right, i haven't been asleep for 24 hours kids. and you know what a lack of sleep can do to you, right? it'll make you do some crazy shit. like taking pictures of yourself:   urlLink     is that...sunlight?    urlLink     check out my buddy holly spectacles    urlLink     this bandana is gangsta   so sleep when you can or  urlLink this  will happen to you! when razo finally wakes up he's like "What the fuck bitch hurry the hell up with my computer!"  and i start like rushing cus he's dangerous like that. after a while we decide to catch a flick (Anchorman). it was pretty funny, i dug it. we had to wait outside to get picked up and some pregnant chix were checkin' out razo and i had to like kick them in the stomachs to get them away from the poor guy. and then razo's wonderful mother gives me a ride home.  i finally get home and the first thing i did was shat. i'm not too fond of dropping bombs in other people's houses, so i waited til i was back home and kept it real in my own bathroom. this concludes my kickass weekend. oh yeah i got this awesome song by  urlLink Andy Hunter . it's called Go.  note to self: get a car.
