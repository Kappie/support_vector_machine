Leaving kids overnight unsupervised was the biggest "faux pas" I have ever heard of. And sure, it's a cute story of a bunch of little kids trying to raise money by selling a $250 drink of lemonade but if you're still denying any responsibility for the fire, then why not wait until after the verdict to raise money? I think that this is the big man upstairs saying "Serves you right for not letting gays into the scouting organization". Karma at its finest.
