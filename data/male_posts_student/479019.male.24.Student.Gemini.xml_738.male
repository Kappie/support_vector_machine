The  The Wiz , being full of African-American pop icons in a dystopic New York has to have some sort of complex message to be said. Maybe I’ll give it another watch before returning it.  So my ATM did get cancelled. Bleh… I need to go to campus and try to get cash using my checks.  I wonder if my professor will be able to make it school in this kind of weather. He lives in Ithaca, which is a long drive in this kind of weather.  I need to finish editing my paper and prepare for my presentation tomorrow. Just a little more.  Almost back in Irvine!!!  **
