I seriously don't know how I am going to be able to handle living over the next few months. I don't really see much point to be honest. I've never loved anyone so much. I'm never going to stop loving her either.  If you ever change your mind, I will be here Mandy. I will drop everything and come running. All you have to do is ask. I promise.  Last night was the best night in my life. I felt so special. I will never forget it.  Anyway - like I said, I don't feel anything right now because I haven't yet accepted it.   FUCK YOU ALL.
