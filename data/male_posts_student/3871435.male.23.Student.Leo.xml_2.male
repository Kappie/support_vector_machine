I thought I'd rather concentrate on my studies first and then whatever comes, comes.  Today I'm back, and I'm planning to inform of this to my friends and families (SHOCK! HORROR!) - on second thought, maybe not them... yet. But my friends will be the first to know.  Ah... just so you know I'm an avid Agatha Christie reader; you can throw anything at me that has Agatha Christie written all over it and I won't retaliate. It's a wonder that someone like her - if you ever saw her photo you won't believe it either - could have thought of some of the genre's most ingenious plots. And murder mysteries are such a difficult genre to write, let alone to devise a plot around it. I know; I'm sort of a writer myself.  Doyle is another old-time favourite, though his methods are more exhaustive than entertaining. E.A. Poe is one of the earliest, in fact some claimed him to be the creator of both the murder mystery and science fiction (read  The Murders in the Rue Morgue  and  Von Kempelen's Discovery  to find out more). He's still the best, and I never experienced true terror until I read  The Raven  a few years back...  Fanfiction (for those who saw the word for the first time today) means writing about a movie/comic/storybook/anything else you can think of the way you want it to be. Some of the most famous including the X-Men (convoluted storylines are the greatest sources of fanfiction), anime, manga, the Harry Potter books (JK Rowling actually encouraged this activity! Score for the ficcers and Harry Potter manias worldwide - myself included!!!) and the movies. In a sentence, it's writing a fiction about a fiction. Makes sense? No? Then go to the Fanfiction.net via the link at the side. I'm Hemlock, by the way if you're curious. I can't tell you what I'm writing about now - you gotta check them for yourselves.  A few days ago I came across a novel by Dan Brown. It's called  The Da Vinci Code . I'll try to fit everything in a nutshell. It's about a professor whose expertise is in symbols and their arcane meanings called as a suspect/witness when the senior director of the Louvre Museum was killed in a very strange way. Later he found much, much more besides great art: that the big L was hiding a lot of things behind his masterpieces, and even the great Mona Lisa has her (or is it his? I'm really confused by now) own secrets, smiling enigmatically from behind those age-old canvass. It's a great book, and though I haven't had the chance to really read it through, I know this book is a very good one. For one, it has incited controversy among the Christians. You can look for more of it in the Internet. Maybe later on I'll add the links for you to go and decide for yourselves.   I've always loved mysteries, hidden meanings and the fact that everything can be interpretated in more ways than two (hehe). I've always have a soft spot for anything that takes a lot of time to figure out. The hieroglyphics were my favourite posters, and I'd spend hours merely staring at this one big poster in my bedroom wondering what could they mean; were they are hidden doorways into some other secret places?   When my friend pointed out that the poster was depicting a passage from the book of the dead, I pulled it down as soon as he was gone.  This month, I've been discovering a lot of stuff. I've never listened to Alban Berg before - he was one of those great modernists, with strange tonal-atonal stuff going about. Although I've read about his opera  Wozzeck  (or  Woyzeck ,  Wozzek , depending where you hail from) it was only a scratch of the surface. When I'm done today, I'll be listening to the full opera.   I've always wanted to listen to  Wozzeck  because it was an unconventional opera in every sense. When it was premiered, everybody thought it was strange, bad taste and eventually it almost became obsolete. Someone had the fine thought of reviving it and it was hailed as a psychological study of a man who was a very big loser. Something like that.   I'm bad at synopsis, but suffice to say that there are no screaming divas or happy endings. Again I must say that  Wozzeck  is not your typical opera.  Yeah... I think I'll hang up for now. Maybe next time I'll bring on some links to my favourite anime right now, Naruto, and all sorts of other links. G'bye!  Me who currently reads  Sophie's World...
