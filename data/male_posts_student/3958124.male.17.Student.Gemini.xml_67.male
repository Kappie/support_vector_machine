It was my 4th time reading it and consideriding it is 870 its was still as magical the 4th time. Read on for more...  Anyway news has reached me that the 6th Harry Potter book is to be titled "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince". As several people know I love to theorize what is gonna happen in the next harry potter book and I usually am right. I will not ruin the story for u but I will say what I believe the title to mean. Harry Potter is obviously the half blood prince. His mother was a muggle and his father a wizard making him half blood, But a prince what does this mean u may say. Well I will tell u exactlly what it means. Harry is a member of the Gryffindor house because they display bravery. But there is more to Harry's link to this house then meets the eye. Harry is infact the Heir of Gordric Gryffindor one of the original founders of Hogwarts. This is hinted throughout the series as harry pulled a sword belonging to Gordric out of the sortingin the 2nd book while fighting the Basalisk. Dumbledor then told Harry that only a true member of the Gryffindor House could have done that. This is an obvious connection but another that I have found is in the first or second book im not sure which they mention harry's parents lived in Gordrics Hallow obviouslly named after Godric Gryffindor. This would make Harry a prince in a way. There is one curveball to this and it is the fact that Harry's father was in Slytherin. Im not sure why I believe this but im pretty sure it is true.Anyway leave comments on harry potter and I will give More of my Theories. More entries Later... Peace Out !
