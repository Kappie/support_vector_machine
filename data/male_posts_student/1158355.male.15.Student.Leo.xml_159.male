Man, Manhattan is insanely crowded, especially this retarded American Girl building I was dragged into. After the performance, we met at TGIF in Islandia. We had fun singing and then my aunt brought up the matrix and you know what that means...yes, I'm gonna keep talking about it. All you need is one little "matrix" and I'm going forever. My dad kept arguing with me that the place at the end (sunrise park w/ the bench dedicated to Thomas Anderson) of Revolutions was the real world, my dad's a retard but I guess he's cool for a dad concidering he likes stuff I like, and most dads I know don't like anything his son likes except women. I got home to do my homework and I got caught up in writing all these very intelligent matrix analogies which relate to religion and philosophy, if you want to see it, just ask me or ask me online and I'll tell you what it was about. I'm too tired (not a surprise) to write it in this. It's freaking 12:07 and I have school tomorrow! Ok bye.
