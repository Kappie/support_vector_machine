So I got my old hard drive yesterday. So I placed an order for the kit to change it into an external drive. Mmmm.... a 3000+ song playlist here I come!  I've chilled out a bit from yesterday. Maybe it has something to do with absurdly COLD weather. I need to get reading for Thursday going... fuck Thursday is gonna be long. I'll be on campus from around 9:45 AM to 8:30 PM.  ***
