I'm still at school... supposedly doing business crap, but a blogging break won't hurt. I'm about to go to orchestra rehearsal... I only have two left and we suck!! I'll be going to Richmond Hill for OFSAA.... I dun even know why I'm going, cuz I suck at shooting, and also, I'd rather go to dress rehearsal. So yeah... life is a lil busy, and I think it would blow even more but... I got a few things to be glad about:  Last Sunday! Wow that was quite a good day compared to my other Sundays (sundaes? yum hee hee). I also hope to go to Em's Von's maybe Keane's? lol art show next Monday! So I won't think about waking up at 6 for three days for now.... (I usually wake at 7:30 so it's a big step for me!!) That's all for now... back to my culminating project..... PSSST *hoarse whisper* anyone wanna help me?    Vickz
