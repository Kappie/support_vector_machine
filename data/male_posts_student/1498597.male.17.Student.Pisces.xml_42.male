This is  JR.  with the  Graveyard Shift !  Luckily, I don't get paid to do this, so I won't be fired or anythin'.  As  Nick  said, many things are changin'.  Some for the better, and some for the worst.  Life has been seriously fuckin' hectic, which explains the shortage of blogs we are havin'.  The school year is comin' to a close and I'm glad to say that I have completed most of the required projects, although I still have some work to do for Pre-AP English 2.  We will try to update the blog more often as soon as we get more free time to do so!  And yes  Elizabeth , I will watch  Top Secret!  one of these days.  Even though the school year is close to bein' over, we will still be workin' hard on many things, this blog bein' one of them.  Now for current events that have/will be takin' place on this site.  Well, not much has been happenin'.  In fact, I have little to say at this point, and I really don't want to type an overview of today...though it is very much worthy to blog about!   Nick and I  still havta work with the pictures for the site, which we haven't been keepin' up with.  There is really a lack of time to work on the blog though, which has made both the readers, I assume, and the authors quite angry.  Well thats kinda it for now.  Check back for updates.  Give it a week or two....hahah!
