I paid $15 for that one. Then, I didn't manage to give Cheam his gift which I bought with Leon yesterday. That was a sad $7.50, and then, to top it all off, I didn't go for Geraldine's play which I paid $10 for. All in all, I wasted $25 and a subjective waste of $7.50. Great huh.  Satyish messaged me yesterday and told me the details of the 04S12 class chalet in Sentosa. The dates clash with those of the CAP. Am very upset about this. What rotten luck. To all my S12rs. I'm really really sorry about not being able to come but CAP won't let me out... even for a day. This really sucks. I miss you guys so so so much. I really wanted to see you guys again and do the things we used to do. Lets go out to Seoul Garden or the beach or something ok?  I should make a comparison. S12 loved each other like family for 3 months. We knew when something was wrong with one of out mates just by a look into their eyes. We never left a man behind. S12 had no cliques and we loved everyone regardless of personality type, colour or religion. S12 could play netball! As a team with dynamics! And we were mighty good at it too! I love my S12 and wouldn't trade it for almost anything. Not even a million bucks.  AA2 has some good points too. It helps me rely on God for my daily survival now. I love them but they spit on me. I'll just have to continue showing them love which could only be sustained by God's providence. Also, I'm cool with people like Jem, Khung Lin, David, Daphne, Jason, Cheam. The rest, well, I'm sure they have their good points too.  I've got the CAP briefing tomorrow and I don't even know how to get there. After that, I've got the PPCDL practical re-exam. I really hope I don't fail this time. If I do, It'll cost me another $55 which I really cant afford. Wish me luck.  I have many songs on my computer now. I feel like a pirate. ARRRR MAYYTEEEE! Oh no! It's taking over me!  This is the second time I'm typing out this entry coz the first time, I'd finished, but the com hung on me before I could publish. Feel miserable coz I think there's something that I'm missing from the first entry... ahhh! PSHAW! sod it lah!
