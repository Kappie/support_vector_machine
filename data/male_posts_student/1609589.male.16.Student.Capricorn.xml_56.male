It's on August 12, so if anybody wants to go, IM or call me and we'll figure something out.  Ticket prices:  Low: $23.50 Medium: $31.00 High: $41.00  If you have ever been to Next Stage @ Grand Prairie, (i have), you know how seating is laid out, so it'll be easier to choose a seat. I wish i knew which section of seats was usually picked to go on stage, (yes, people go on stage) so who knows...  People singing along with BMG- Dave Matthews Tracy Bonham Gavin Rossdale Venus Hum   Shoot, i need to buy these tickets FAST, i just searched for best tickets available for 4 people, we get far west balcony :( so IM me now if you wanna go!
