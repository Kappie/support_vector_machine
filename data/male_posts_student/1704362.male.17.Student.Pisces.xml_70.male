This one i had while sleeping over Conor's house...   So i'm sitting at the beach. I think it's on Long Beach Island. I'm sitting on the dock with one other person who i don't know, and we're watching the bay. It's a normal summer day (only oddly dark), the clouds are floating by, and suddenly one cloud starts to form into what looks exactly like a nuclear mushroom cloud. Then, suddenly, a real nuclear bomb explodes and an identical-looking mushroom cloud appears right next to it. Somehow i know it's real. Then the shock wave hits, i die, and wake up.   Thoughts: Could be meaningless, as i spent alot of time unleashing nuclear armageddon upon the world in a computer game during the day. On the other hand, it could be revealing some deep-seated thoughts in my unconscious. Anyone want to pick my brain with an amateur psychoanalysis? Leave a comment.  (PS - If someone says that this dream means i'm actually gay, i hate you.)  End Transmission.
