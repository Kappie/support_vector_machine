Started with me going to sleep at 3AM and waking at 6AM, lol, in a rush to get read and out of the house to Piccadilly Train Station for 8:15AM.  So there is me, rushing away like a maniac seen only in a mental asylum, getting all prepared, showered and out of the door...I catch the buses and walk at my fast pace just to get there.  When I get there about 30 mins early.  So i wait, and about 6 coaches from Stockport appear...but no James, Kylie, Vicky or Michelle.  More time passes, and when they eventually appear, we spend more time in the shops of the station than anywhere else!! ugh.  Then we have the train journey, which wasn't too bad!  And then we had the weateher :O) Yes, it was interesting, to say the least!  What with rain and wind pushing everything! lol, but despite it was rather funny to see Kylie struggling away with an umbrella as the forces of nature destroyed it!  Then we got on a rickety old tram, go to the pleasure beach and "Opens at 11:30" **looks at watch** "10:25" Arghhhh, so we all blamed Vicky and just went in an arcade after yet more roaming around in the soaking rain.  But overall, when the park did open, and we were thoroughly soaked through -- and then more so from Valhalla **remembers Vicky's "maximising" eyeliner** lol, it was a V. V. good day!!  Thanks to my friends who went, it couldn't have been any better really.  Even with the early-ness.  It just added to the fun factor as much as the weather did.  Ahhhh, lol, I'm rushing this entry now -- but -- I'm also quite happy that School is out.  Finally I have some freedom!  And can properly plan ahead for Canada now.  I'm feeling so weird -- detached from my friends, even though I want to keep them all because they ARE all GREAT -- and confused as to what to do from day to day.  hrmm.  But nm, all will eventually sort out, I am sure.  Hopefully I will also post in here much more -- and you can **hopefully** look forward to another entry in this later!!  See you soon,  Andy
