We walked around town shopping and then went to the cinema to see that film with Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet... I forget the name. It was confusing and I didn't really understand it. Went to Mandy's after the film and just lay there cuddling and stuff and it was lovely! Then Mandy came to mine on the Sunday and the whole day was so nice until the last hour or so. I got angry. God, I have a problem. Mandy pointed out that most of my friends are female and I didn't understand why she got upset about it. I should of thought about it from her point of view. Anyway, I got angry and shouted, and when she tried to leave I hung on to her. I followed her to the bus stop and pleaded forgiveness but she got on the bus. I cried all the way home and cried on my bed whilst reading various things she had written for me. Cheesy? I told one of my best friends, Adam, about it and he invited me over to get drunk and talk about it. I wrote a really long letter to Mandy and grabbed some money. I went round to Adams and had a pretty good time drinking and eating snackages. I left at 10.20 and went to catch the bus to Mandy's. When I arrived I gave her the note and went for a walk. I remember getting myself lost but I found my way back. We talked for ages and it seemed that Mandy really did want it to end. So we went back to her house and I cried myself to sleep. I woke up at 5.30am and got kicked out. Had to walk about 2 miles in the freezing cold in hope that the bus driver would let me on with only a Â£20 note. He did, wooo! Chris called me and said he was near my house so I met him and we walked around for a while. I got home at about 7.00am, lit some candles and cried myself to sleep again. Woke up this morning at around 11am and immediately started texting Mandy. I went to see her at 3.oopm to try and sort things out. After a few hours, things weren't looking good. I tried so hard to convince her she was the only thing I wanted and I would do anything to prove that to her. We decided that I am to go on an anger management course thingy to try and sort it. I want to cure this so much. In the end, we kinda got back together, on a trial type thingy. But I am so happy and these last few days have really shown me how much she means to me and how much I would hate myself if I let this all go. I love you Mandy =)
