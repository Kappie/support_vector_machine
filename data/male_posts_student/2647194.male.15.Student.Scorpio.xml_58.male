My lips are really tired, and I still can't hit the blasted tuning note!!!! GRRRR!!!!  Yeah, maybe I shouldn't expect so much out of myself on the second time, but hey-I need to work hard on it. And yes, the following quote is true.  "I don't believe you can do anything if you really want to, but I do believe you can play anything if you work hard enough." Right on, Jamie.  Maybe I should only practice for 15 minutes at first. I'll probably kill my lips and not be able to play for days, so I'll have to slow it down a bit. I do expect too much too fast...  Dammit. Trackstar is working again, so I have to go finish this crappy english webquest.  Today: NO SCHOOL!!!! hehehe I picked up a copy of a fingering chart and lip slurs from Jamie (thanks), did some homework, borrowed a trumpet from Amanda, and practiced for too long. Yeah...not a whole lot, but this week is going to be busy. Tommorow there's the MSA Spring concert. On Wednesday, there's the RANDOM concert at MCTC. Plus I'm going to be playing trumpet a ton this week, so music really is my life this week.  I'll features a song that Minnesota Brass did on Saturday night. By the way, they're phenominally good.  "Well, it's a marvelous night for a Moondance With the stars up above in your eyes A fantabulous night to make romance 'Neath the cover of October skies And all the leaves on the trees are falling To the sound of the breezes that blow And I'm trying to please to the calling Of your heart-strings that play soft and low And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush   Can I just have one a' more Moondance with you, my love Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love   Well, I wanna make love to you tonight I can't wait 'til the morning has come And I know that the time is just right And straight into my arms you will run And when you come my heart will be waiting To make sure that you're never alone There and then all my dreams will come true, dear There and then I will make you my own And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside And I know how much you want me that you can't hide   Can I just have one a' more Moondance with you, my love Can I just make some more romance with a-you, my love   Well, it's a marvelous night for a Moondance With the stars up above in your eyes A fantabulous night to make romance 'Neath the cover of October skies And all the leaves on the trees are falling To the sound of the breezes that blow And I'm trying to please to the calling Of your heart-strings that play soft and low And all the night's magic seems to whisper and hush And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush    One more Moondance with you in the moonlight On a magic night La, la, la, la in the moonlight On a magic night Can't I just have one more dance with you my love"  -"Moondance", Van Morrison
