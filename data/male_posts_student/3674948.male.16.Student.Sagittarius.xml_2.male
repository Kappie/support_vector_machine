Anyway in other news Google   fans out there can get their very own G-mail accounts that have a Gb of storage.  Does that seal the deal.  I don't think so.  Apparently you can't delete any of your mail, ever.  Crazy- yes!  Also Google will constantly search your 'private' mail and send you appropriate spam!  Madness but some may say it is worth it for all that storage.
