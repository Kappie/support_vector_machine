I rarely wear shoes unless I'm going someplace.  The pain didn't bug me, it felt kinda cool, but it smelt awful.  I got a ton of mosquito bites, almost ran out of matches to burn wood ticks with, and Perham was on the edge of a pretty big storm.  Though nothing happened, all those tornado warnings scared the shit out of me.  But I came up with a new story plot line so it was all worth it. ^__^  I could go pretty far with this one.
