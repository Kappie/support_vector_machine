Kids going around in cheaply made costumes of cartoon characters and monsters collecting candy from strangers who could have had that candy out on their filthy coffee tables for over 10 years? Sounds fine to me. Well, I'm still debating on whether or not I should wear a costume. Costumes some of my friends are wearing include wrapping themselves in 20 rolls of tape and dressing up as the others moms vagina. Yes, these are my friends. And now thinking about it, no I'm not going to dress up. I wonder what made me decide....
