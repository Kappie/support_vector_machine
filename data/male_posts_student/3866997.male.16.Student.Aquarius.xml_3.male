The mind of an adolescent is naturally an unstable environment, but oh how much worse it has become since society itself has become "mobile". The world expanded from a neighborhood to an international society in such a fast time people are rushing to catch up and in the process are missing so much joy in just BEING. We have TVs, CD players, radios, and a whole plethora of different things to keep us from stopping and just enjoying the view by filling our mind with such loud and useless information. I mean, can you really think of a time you've had a life changing epiphany while watching telivision? Sure there's nothing wrong with entertainment, but when it passes the line from entertainment to distraction that's when the problem arises. Back in my grandmother's day someone would be born in and spend most of their lives if not die in a single house or at the very least a single city. I personally have no room to talk because I've lived in Wisconsin, Texas, British Columbia, and Louisiana in the past 2 years, but I regret moving so much. During my time at the seminary I was pretty much stationary. There was perfect stability. I could say with absolute surety what I would be doing the next day, whereas now things are very much UN-stable. For instance, I walked into our living room night before last. My brother looked up at me from the couch and said, "Hey, Jess, wanna go to New Orleans?" about 10 hours later, we were on our way to the Big Easy. Doing things on the spur of the moment is a wonderful thing. It keeps people on their toes, but a certain basic amount of stability is a necessity for the proper functioning of society. Just something to chew on.  Now, enough about society! More about ME! It still amazes me how someone can be just sitting around unsuspectingly and all the sudden something will happen that changes their life forever. This is how it happened with most of the great things that have happened to me in my life: my conversion to Catholicism, my parents' divorce, my decision to go to boarding school, my meeting Preston. Now, I believe one of those moment may be happening right before my eyes. I met a boy tonight through either XY or Mogenic, can't remember which. His name is Drew. So far I don't know anything about him I don't like. He's incredible to say the least. Very intelligent, charming, confident in himself, also quite confident in me which is a nice feeling, and towering over all these qualities is how much he seems to care about ME and not about what I can do for him. This is definately a feeling I'm not used to just yet. So far, I know two boys that have provided that adequately. The rest have quite obviously been using me. You know who you are, ya crazy dutch bastards. At the very least, I'm expecting Drew and I to become very good friends.  The Moral of the Story: And so the story's told of a hearty group of men it's a tale of their triumphs and their woes. Be it raids and melees ancient or the modern worker's struggle that inspires men to stand up for their rights. And should we fall down by the wayside in this ever-changing world we can look back to these heroes of our past. With their staunch determination and ferocious iron will, no tyranny would quell them in their task. It's an age-old situation with an ever-present message: that time and tide waiteth for no man. So without fear of confrontation of the consequence of outcome, it's for freedom and for happiness they toiled. An in looking to the future, we can see a better place where we can shake the yoke of tyranny for all. It's been paved by generations who have gone now to their rest. It's just remembrance of their dignity we ask. Under perilous conditions with small hope of success they left behind the lives that they once led and by virtue of their fortitude and single-minded strength they cleared the way for the people of today so when we think back to our ancestors respectfully we hark and thank the men whose struggle broke the chain it's a long road up ahead of us - let's forge on while we're strong and leave our mark of honor once again So the story has been told and it comes now to an end. It's setting any era, any land. When abusive tyrants force the hands of matters great or small, it inpires men to stand up for their rights.
