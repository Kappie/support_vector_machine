Thanks to the ability to change the date it was posted,I added everything and it looks like nothing was ever different. The only way you know is because of this. Heck, I could have left you hanging like nothing ever happened =P  Anyway, you need to remember that anything past ' urlLink New Member/ 2nd Post ' is going to be from the other Blog. My old one. Anyway, that's it about my blog, but be sure to refresh it in a sec cause I'm about to post again about today.
