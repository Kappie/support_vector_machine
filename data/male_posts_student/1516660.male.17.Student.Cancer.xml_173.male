I completed an E-Maths chapter (Statistics), an A-Maths chapter (Simultaneous Equations) and 3 Physics chatpers (Electricity). Me-ow meow! At least it is better than some other days.   Okie...today I went out to eat breakfast with Mother. I ate laksa. We then went to the Shop N Save (after buying Eight Days). I read Eight Days while follwing her walk around Shop N Save checking out new prices and codes for fruits and veggies. Meow meow! We came back at 9.30. Then, I got distracted! I started reading the Charmed book (Gypsy Enchantment) and read and read nons-top for 1 hour until the end of the book. So enchanting! Woah!! I wanna find out is Ivan really terrible. Gypsy magick galore!  Ayiah...I got study la...Study study study until 12. Me and Mother went to 768 to eat kuay chap. Then, we met my brother, who went to MacDonald's to eat.  Came back. Yada yada Yada. Studied Studied Studied, with minor interruptions here and there as the family is asking me advice for which course to choose (my brother's going to Sec 3 next year).   I stopped studying at 4.45. I came online and relaxed la. Meow meow meow until now lor. And today wor! Ying TianCheng died!! He finally died! Hurray! YaY!!! Meow meow meow!!
