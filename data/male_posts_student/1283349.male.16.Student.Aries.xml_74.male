I actually feel a little naughty about it.  I went out to the mall tonight with my home boy Fry, for dinner and a movie with some lovely ladies and some pimply fellas. I must say, I felt rather foxy. We ate chinese food and caught Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Surprise surprise, it was actually really funny, if you're juvenile (and I am!) Good ole Ben Stiller, he can really deliver the stupidity. This Jennie person, she was a blast. Fun, fabulous sense of humor (seeing as it meshes quite nicely with mine), and she is undoubtedly a nerd. Being with my People is nice. I get that solid sense of belonging, like at gaming conventions. (And she was cute, to boot! Good times, this evening.)  Oh, and I bought a sa-weet wristband that has an old skool 8 bit icon on it and the words: LEVEL UP! Oh, and the Nintendo logo on the back. It makes me hearken back to the days of Duck Hunt and Final Fantasy 1.  Ugh, tired.
