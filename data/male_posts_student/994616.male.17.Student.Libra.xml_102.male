It is about a girl who goes to  urlLink France  to see her sister, who is about to get married. But just as she arrives the fiance is leaving. The rest of the movie is about the different problems that arise from this, and how the Americans and the French deal with things differently.   urlLink Kate Hudson   has a sort of appearance where you cant take you're eyes off her, She lights up the room which lends the movie a happy feeling. The costumes were fantastic,Ingris and I kept leaning over and commenting on the different clothes they were wearing. some of the jokes were misses but most of them were pretty funny.   The only things that sucked were her hair cut for the second half,  urlLink James Ivory  needed to build up the relationships a bit more (I didn't realise that two of the characters were dating until she said "I can't get a new husband until i get rid of my old one") and the plot did meander a bit. The times that were boring should have been used to develop and fill in some of the smaller plot strands. The crazy american lover could definitely been used for a few more laughs.  All in all a  pleasant comedy  set in france. Any change to laugh at the  urlLink french  is good. Kate Hudson just made it better. I would give it 7 / 10.  Sorry for the lack of a LOTD yesterday, i didn't get home until 12:07 so I missed out. Here's two to make up for it    urlLink  NaNoWriMo   Its a challenge - write an entire 50,000 word novel between Nov. 1 and Nov. 30 People who are getting  sponsors for their  urlLink children  .  There's my attempt at utisiling the web medium, but writing only brief ammounts, utilising  urlLink linking ,  boldening  the important words and allowing interaction.
