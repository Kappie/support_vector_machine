I am reading a lot of philosophy, which is great fun for me.  I have a class on Romantic poetry and we won't have read a poem for class until the third week of the semester.  So far we have read some Diderot, some Kant and some Foucoult.  The prof is cool and he says that you can't study Romantic poetry without studying the  urlLink Enlightenment philosophy  that these guys were working with.   And I'm taking a class on major American authors since 1900.  On the list so far are T. S. Eliot, William Carlos Williams, and Hemingway.  The prof for that class is cool too. And my last class is about critical methods.  Essentially a theory of literary studies class.  This is also heavy on the philosophy, which suits me just fine.
