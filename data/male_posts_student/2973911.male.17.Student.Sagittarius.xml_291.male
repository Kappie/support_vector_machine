I think you underestimated yourself thinking that you are overly cautious.  You are, but that's a good thing.  Well, can't say the same here.  Still single, still a virgin, still bothered with mental difficulties.  Still mad inside and silent outside.  And I can go for married people, although that would make me a thief and maybe I'll get killed in the process.  Maybe you should be silent on this one.  And  don't get a new boyfriend just because you want to forget that experience.  You might get into other troubles.
