And today after school he just really craved it.  So now it is time.  Well he will at least write about some things he did today.  And if he has more to talk about tonight then he can just add a new post.  Today began normal.  Tyke and Tyronius sat in his car before school, which isn't normal and then Tyke decided to walk alone to math.  That also wasn't normal but it might become normal.  Tyke then got in math and just sat there.  He didn't talk to Tina and sorta just played like he had nothing to say to her.  Which of course is false.  He sooooo had stuff to say.  But he just tried to pay attention to class and that actually sorta paid off.  Tina then asked Tyke some questions and they started chatting.  Well most of you won't guess the topic of conversation that arose.  Karla and Tyke began talking about Tyke's blog and then Tina asked about it.  She has been hearing about it a lot so she wanted to read it.  So Tyke ended up giving her the URL and they talked some more about it.  She asked if he didn't want her to read it and he said that maybe a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't have but not now.  Now it is fine.  So she obviously knows what is a highly repeated topic of conversation.  But Tyke decided he doesn't care.  It's not like he really has anything to lose.  He has told her pretty much everything he feels in The Letter and then not long after that showed her the music video he made of Amazed which was a blatant reference to her.  So if she hasn't been totally freaked out yet, then he probably doesn't have anything to worry about.  And it isn't like she is going to have a change of heart anytime soon and realize what a great guy Tyke is cuz that just never happens.  Of course it could happen, but hanging onto that hope is idiocy in the mind of Tyke.  So now he will talk about something new now, especially since she may read the blog.  Not tonight cuz the basketball game is tonight but sometime maybe yes.  So hey, if you are reading this Tina, hope you enjoy it.  Well Tyke's day progressed pretty nicely.  Purdy was back at school today but Dotti was not because of DECA.  Nor was Haras.  So it was just Tyke and Purdy in english.  They decided that after school Tyke would drive Purdy around to get flowers and stuff at Party 4 Less cuz she was not going to have her car.  Purdy seemed surprised for Tyke's offer but he wasn't just doing it to be nice.  He wanted to be able to just hang out with somebody after school and of course Purdy is fun to hang out with.  Well as goes Tyke's luck, plans changed.  After school Purdy was telling Tyke how her bro wasn't awake when she left in the morning so she didn't know if he actually went to school.  And since he needed the car she wasn't going to have it.  So that is why Tyke was in the picture.  Well after waiting for her bro to come to the car and calling his cell and such she came to the conclusion that he was at home.  Thus she would just go home and then get Ekul to go with her instead of Tyke.  So Tyke got in his car and went home.  Kind of a rainy, dismal, foggy drive.  He waved at Shawna when he passed her but that was the highlight.  The music was good but it didn't make it so great that he had fun.  So he was in an odd mood.  Kinda dazed or numb again.  He has been out of it a lot of times since The Letter.  This may be totally coincidental but it is still true.  Well anyway he just came home and had an incredible urge to blog.  He is in love with this blog.  As he told Karla, if he could marry his blog, he would.  Which is sad.  Cuz he would be marrying words and an internet site which is visited by very few visitors.  Less than 400 in a week or so.  Which is actually a good number but that doesn't mean that his blog is viewed by random people.  Tyke is looking forward to Tolo.  This year he feels pretty secure about, first off a girl asking him.  And second, a girl he wants to ask him to ask him.  He has been asked once, last year, but it was a totally random girl really and he really didn't want to go.  So he didn't.  He felt really bad about doing so but he still did it.  It is hard to say no.  Maybe not for everyone but for Tyke it is.  He really doesn't ever want to do that.  It would be great if tolo ended up being better than homecoming.  Who knows if there is any chance of that though?  Well, he better not get ahead of himself.  It is still a long ways away though and it certainly is not a foregone conclusion that someone will ask him.  No need to worry.  Hey, they already planned out the Tolo group anyway, right?  Speaking of stuff, Skippy just reminded Tyke of Operation G-Force.  That failed fast.  Way too fast.  Still a total failure for Tyke in fact.  Which is unfortunate.  Cuz Tyke and G-Force would go well together.  This blog hasn't said anything real great so he will come back later tonight after basketball and then hopefully have some interesting things to write.  Bye for now. (*forced smile)
