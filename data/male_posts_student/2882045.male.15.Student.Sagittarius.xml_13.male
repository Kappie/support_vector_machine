Anyways, I'm bored so I figured I'd post. True, I should be working on my history paper, but you can only talk about Shakespeare for so long until your sperm count begins to drop. Why? Beats me.                My day today? It was thuper, thank you!! Wore my Hooters shirt, didn't get chastised for it. I was elected Initiation Marshall for next year's Thespian Initiations...no idea what I'm suppose to do, but the name sure as hell sounds awesome, don't it?!?               And in girl news...I had one call me today. She was just calling to inform me of my being voted  INITIATION MARSHALL  (DUNDUNDUNNNNNNNNNNN) for next year's initiates, so she only expected the call to last like two minutes. BOOOOOOYYYYY was she wrong!! I babbled on for like 45 minutes..I was doing all the talking, note you...I felt like a schoolgirl again. I hadn't felt that way since before the operation...back when my name was Ripina, good time for hire. But I couldn't believe how I just kept going on and on. Oh well.              Once again, my big mouth got me in trouble today...surprise surprise. I said mean shit about someone who really doesn't deserve mean shit to be said about her. Ummmm... prom's this weekend. School's almost out. Paper's almost finished. My hair's on fire. Im almost a thespian. HOLY SHIT, MY HAIRS ON FIIIREEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  "AIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
