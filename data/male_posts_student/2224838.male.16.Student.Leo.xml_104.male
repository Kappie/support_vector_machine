These clips are dubbed over with new dialogue and even some of the animation is changed and remixed. ... Watch the videos closely to catch it all. If you don't get it, don't worry. It is meant to be random and goofy.  There are two new  urlLink G.I. JOE public service announcements  online now. Perhaps not as funny as the rest, but they are, nonetheless, wicked funny.
