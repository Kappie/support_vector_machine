And it is a whole lot better than doing worksheets and watching stupid videos in Drivers Ed - which is why I can't work this year (and can't get a raise for next year!). I have to have 30 hours of classroom time over three weeks. Again me quitting the basketball team earlier would have made it possible because I would have signed up for the first session (I thought I would be going to that D-1 camp during the first session when I signed up). So that makes at least 2 things I could've done if I had quit basketball sooner (ECHO and corn de-tassling).
