Ya see, Mom didn't really like Thomas much because he was a real nervous cat and really acted like we were his servants, right? So, Trenton, the other cat, doted on her a lot more and was much more worshipful of her ... would she have taken as much time with him as she did Thomas ... ? Who knows ... except I liked Thomas.
