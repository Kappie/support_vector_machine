And when he got back he apparently never got the message I left him on the answering machine in the office asking him to call me back to let me know when I should be come in for work. So he'd been working a week thinking I was still on vacation till I called him Saturday.) He'd brought in someone from another office to help him while I was on my supposed vacation. I knew where everything was in the office. I had a system. And she'd gone and fucked that all up, rearranging cabinets and drawers, and moving things from one room to another. So I spent a good half-hour figuring out where everything was, from the cotton rolls to the topical anesthetic. She'd gone and moved the syringes from the drawer in the back with the rest of the instruments into the patient rooms. To anyone else, it'd seem stupid to care, but trust me on this: when you're a dental assistant, knowing where everything is  is  a big deal. That bitch.  Juliana's disappeared. She apparently came into work Wednesday, told Doc, "See you Saturday," as she was leaving, then never came into work Saturday. She ran away to Canada according to her cousin. So you know what that means: I get her Saturday shift. More hours mean more money, but they also mean more responsibility. I've got to do the things Juliana used to do, like clean out the microfilm developer. I guess it's a little selfish of me, even a little cruel, to be more concerned with getting her hours than her well-being, but c'mon: she's in Canada. What young Columbian girl wouldn't be having fun in the Great White North? Canada's just like Columbia, only colder, with a rampant cannabic culture minus the drug cartels. See, it's just like home. If this were some reality game show, I'd be the winner: the last assistant. I win. I hope she wasn't kidnapped or anything.  Everyone's already gone shopping for college, and what've I been up to? Trying to kill off this chest infection with regular fumigations of tobacco smoke. I don't know how many times Andi's been to Bed, Bath & Beyond, but she apparently went crazy with the registry gun. (They're not just for weddings anymore.) I should probably go and at least look around sometime soon. But I can at least do this, make a new blog, a college-ready one. I got tired of the old one anyway. Reminded me too much of high school. Goodbye,  urlLink koreateen .
