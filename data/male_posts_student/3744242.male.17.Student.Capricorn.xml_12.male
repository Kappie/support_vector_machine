If you have not seen the first Bourne movie, the Bourne Identity, do yourself a big favor and watch it, you will not be sorry...that's a guarantee . And if you have seen the Bourne Identity, you have to see the Bourne Supremacy. It is equal, if not better than the first one...with the best car chase I have ever seen. I could rant for hours, but that would kill most of you, so I'll stop. But if you still need further convincing, the Supremacy makes you question a lot of things about the first movie...in a good way...  I apologize for not writing more often. Camp is very busy and sucks the energy right out of me. I usually end up falling asleep pretty early...that or I play one of my new PS2 games into the wee hours of the night. The games of which I speak are Rainbow Six 3 and Ghost second: Jungle Storm. Both are pretty good games but they both suffer from AI that is just not to par, especially Jungle Storm. I had a sniper gunned down from a tango standing next to him and the rest of the snipers team didn't do anything about it. Well, maybe they didn't really like the guy...that would sort of explain it...I guess. If you haven't tried Rainbow Six 3 though, I highly suggest renting it and playing around. It is mighty fun.  Because I haven't written in a while, I going to start with the most recent events and work backwards. This could get confusing, but we'll give it a go anyway.  I also saw the movie Paycheck tonight. I have to say that it wasn't bad, but after just watching the Bourne Supremacy, I was very disappointed. If you like a good action movie, you should check it out, but it isn't special. You don't have to run out and get it this instant, and that would be hard because I'm writing this pretty late and the rental stores probably aren't open now anyway. Oops, off subject there for a second...wait for it...OK, now I'm back!  Well, to continue of the "today" subject, I also went to the beach with Patrick and his family. Well, going to the beach was our plan and we tried our hardest to get in, but it was full and they turned us around after we waited in line for twenty minutes! They could have just told us at the end of the line that the beach was full and we wouldn't have had to wait in in that STUPID LINE! AHHHHHHHHH! Anger...Subsiding. Rage...Under control. Whew, that was a close call. We did end up kind of hanging around near the ocean in Gloucster and found a small beach area. It was really rocky there, but it was fun to go swimming in the ocean. There is nothing quite like swimming in freezing cold water to get the blood moving. I had a really good chili dog, too.  OK, I bet you're all dying to know about my third and last session of camp. Well, let's just say its been...interesting. For starters, I have a kid who thinks that he is Harry Potter. He thinks this so much that he always talks with an incredibly fake British accent. If you're going to pretend you're British, at least have a decent accent if you're going to use it all the time. And to make things worse, the kid always has to have what he wants. For example, he wanted us to change the entire schedule and all our classes because he was bored after the first day. When we told him that that was impossible and that he should kiss our collective ass (well, maybe we didn't say that last part), the kid took off into the woods. I had to chase him through the paths a good distance up the hill. To tell you the truth, it really wasn't that hard because the kid really does know how to run. I laugh pretty hard every time I see him attempt to run...yeah I know that's really mean, but its the truth, so deal with it. To make a longish story short...ish...we ended up calling the kid's mom and kicked him out of camp for the day which in turn made my day all the brighter!  Camp has been going really well so far. I love my kids so much, even if they do drive me INSANE. They will do anything for me, short of actually listening to me so I can get them to archery on time. They will give me small pieces of their lunch without me saying a word and when we go to Roll on America, they will give me tokens so I can play with them in some game. Ah, now I'm all vaclempted. Talk amongst yourselves. I'll give you a subject: The Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, Roman, nor an empire...discuss!  Wow, don't know where that came from...Now that I'm back to my normal self (whatever that is) I can tell you about the LBD we had at camp on Friday. For those of you who don't know what an LBD is, listen up. LBD stands for   L  out   B  ather   D  rill     and is enacted whenever there is a kid we can't find who was last seen near the water. Now, up to this point, it had always been casual, well, not really casual, but you get what I'm saying. It had always been done after camp with no kids around and we were always prepared for it when it happened. But this one was different. In the middle of lunch at camp, we all hear the air horn (the signal for a Lost Bather) go off. I got up and ran towards the lifeguard shack to check on what was wrong and get a description of the kid. I never got that far. Ig got a description from Ryan as he was running to the bathrooms to check for a Kevin last seen wearing blue shorts. So I sprint over to the fields to check over there. The fields are all clear, so I spring back over the water. I don't think I have ever ran that fast in my life and as I learned from campers, who were watching the whole thing from the Nukem court, that was like a blur I was running so fast. At the water, I ran into the lake where I linked arms with the other counselor where we would rake the lake with our feet to try to find the kid in the water. Now, at this point, none of us knew whether this was a drill or the real thing. We made about five sweeps of the swimming area before we finally moved beyond the ropes and started to sweep the other sections of the lake. At that point, we were all call out of the water and up onto the beach. Lifeguards and counselors were crying left and right. We were all told to sit down while the head guard ran over to check on what was going on. He came back and told us it was all a drill. You cannot believe the relief we all felt when we heard that. People were really shaken up after that exercise. But I was really surprised with myself. I was not effected at all, not even a little bit. I was so focused on our task at hand, finding the kid, that no other emotions or thoughts took over. I was sure that I would have felt something afterward, but there was still nothing. Very strange indeed.  A lot of people were angry that we were put through that, but I think it was one of the best things I have ever done. I showed exactly how I would react in a really life emergency, and I was extremely happy with my results. I was also extremely pleased with the actions and reactions of my fellow staff members. We were perfect in that situation. We made no blunders or mistakes and if there had been a kid in the water, we would have definitely found him or her before significant brain damage appeared. Again, I am extremely happy with how both I behaved and how the staff reacted to the situation.  Wow, I'm glad I got all that off my chest, it was starting to get really heavy. Well, typing all of that tired me out for the night and off to bed. So go away and leave me be.  Out
