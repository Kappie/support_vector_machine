I might put some of them up but don't get your hopes up to much. Everyone having a good last week of summer? I'm bored as crazy and wish I had something to do, or friends old enough to drive somewhere. My website is a year old now. The day was July eleventh or something and I just forgot about it. Where did this past year go?  Life  flies by doesn't it? Live for the moment and have no regrets guys! Everyone should slow down at least a moment during the day and take it all in; everything God has put on this Earth for use to experience daily. What a great thing He has created.
