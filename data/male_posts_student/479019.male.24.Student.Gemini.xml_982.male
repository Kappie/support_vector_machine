Anyway, last night a bunch of us co-workers hung out at Katrina's. It was cool.  Recently I was chatting with some regulars recently before my shift and they said some stuff that represented some of the things I don't like about society. One guy who hits the beach on a regular basis and gets $3 drinks, commented on how Democrats pander to the poor. I don't know where he got that idea. Last I checked no political party gives a crap about the poor. Also, is it such a bad thing to make sure that people don't fall through the cracks?   I dunno man... people buy into the false ideology of meritocracy and tell poor people to get a job, but don't take into account that they had the clothes and running water to look nice before an interview. People with money expect poor people, to work their up the economic ladder... but keep paying these people crap wages so they're stuck mowing their lawns, and flipping their burgers. How do you save money when you're making minimum wage and have bills to pay?  ***
