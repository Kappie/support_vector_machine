I would have left and gone to Barnes and Noble but the only reason I was there in the first place was because I had a gift certificate.  It was a time and a half.  I went up and down the two aisles that applied to me.  There was one aisle of Bibles.  I use the term loosely.  Then next aisle was concordances, and reference books and such like.  Then there were two aisles of Charismatic and an aisle of Christian fiction.  Then a Catholic aisle and a miscellaneous aisle.  No Baptist aisle.  No good books written 50 years ago aisle.  I saw quite a few books that I saw and really wanted but then I picked them up and it would say "Translated in to modern English" or "Bible references updated to NIV or NASV".  It was irritating.  There were no books older than 1995.  It was insanely irritating.  I finally bought a concordance.  Then I went to check out.  The girl was dressed rather interestingly...  Her chest was about to fall out of her shirt.  Her pants were so low and tight I could see her underwear(not just a little bit).  Her shirt was also so high I could see her navel ring.  We won't even mention the music.  Long story.  Good times.
