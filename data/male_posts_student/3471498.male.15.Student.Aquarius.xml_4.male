I would ask everyone if they had any problems but I wouldn't get an answer, I'm still trying to cure world hunger (and then telling no one mwahahahaha) I've  helped fix many a problem but cant seem to fix my own. It's very annoying after a while, and slightly depressing.  well I've talked long enough for now, any body reading must be feeling better by comparing there life to mine.  byby  bob
