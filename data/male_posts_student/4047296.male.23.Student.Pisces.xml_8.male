Several of us stayed to camp. No one had caught anything all day. There were all kinds of people fishing, and not too many people caught anything. Around midnight, i was giving up, but i had some chicken liver still on my hook. So i threw out my line near the campfire and i rigged up a flashlight on top of the pole so that when i got a bite, the pole would bend, hence the light would dance. I was sitting with my mom by the campfire, and out of the corner of my eye, was watching the light. After about an hour or so, the light moved. I rose. Then the light went clear to the ground and i sprinted to the pole. Something was attached to the other end. I picked up the rod and jerked. I hooked em. Then i reeled. And reeled. Then the line got hooked on something. A little tree sticking out of the water about 15 feet from the shore. It was stuck. I went up and down the bank side trying to free the line. (Notice i use the phrase "up" first then "down") I couldent get it free. The fish kept jumping by the tree. I figured the line got tangled about two feet away from where the fish was. I was frustrated. I pulled harder, as it was the only thing to do, hoping the line would free. It broke. I reeled in the empty end and watched the fish jump by the tree where it was tethered to. I gave my Mom the pole and started to take off my shoes and pants. I was going to wade in and get that fish. My Mom scolded me. Its funny that i am 23 and have no fear of wading into a lake, but when my Mom told me not to go in, i argued with her, but finally gave in.  We went back to the fire and shortly after she went to bed. Then i went back to the shore line and stood contemplating. I could wade in without her knowing, but then i would disobeying. Besides, there was the risk of cutting my foot on glass or hooks or who knows what else. I only had one pair of shoes. I decided that i should not wade in. So i came up with an alternate plan. I tried taking some rope i had in my truck and lasoing the tree with rope. My thought was if i could pull the tree out of the lake, the line and fish would come with it.  I tried my luck with the rope. I worked at it for about an hour. I got pretty good at it. In fact a few times i got the rope loop around the tree, but when i pulled, the tree would bend and the rope would float effortlessly back to me. It was hopeless. I stood, extremely frustrated that the fish was still out there. At this point i did'nt want to the fish, i just wanted to free the fish. I was sad to think that the fish had to stay there tethered until by some miracle, God would release it, or by providence's powers, someone else would catch it. I finally went back to the fire around 2:30. I learned a lesson: Always bring a pair of sandals fishing.   On a more elementary note: I was at the mill tonight, and my friend Mark and i were discussing the possibility of my future wife being outside, on the dock. Mark finally took a proactive approach and went out to look. Note:  i do not know who my future wife will be. But he, on return, informed me that she was out there. He said she looked at him and seem to tell him through eye contact that she was thinking: "Where is jared?"...So he told me. We sat there for a while arguing the fact. My point was that the thought, "Where is Jared?" often gets confused with the thought, "Where is Mark?" His main counteracting point was: What if you leave tonight having known she was out there, but did nothing about it. So explained to him that A) If God wanted me to meet her, He would allow it without the telepathic mumbo jumbo Mark was into and B) tonight is a bad night to meet my future wife. I had a lot of homework and a test, and i wouldent want to meet her. At this point, another friend of ours, Derek, chimed in with "If i knew my future wife was out there, I wouldent be able to study and i would want to meet her." Well fine Derek, i said to myself. And to put a rest to the ridiculous conversation i went out with Mark. We stood there and i noticed several attractive people, and i wondered which one omniscient Mark would say was her. He looked disappointed and finally broke the bad news: "It appears she has left." And so we sat down in the very chairs my future wife and her friends sat in, and I have not been able to study since.
