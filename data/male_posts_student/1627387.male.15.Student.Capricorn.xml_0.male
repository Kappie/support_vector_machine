If they aren't happy with their spouse that means they either rushed into marriage or just didn't do a good job picking a person that they would spend their LIFE with.  If you're scared of commitment/future/past/anything involving the person you're marrying, DON'T GET MARRIED! I mean damn, it's just common sense people.  Now there are the people who cheat on a boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse cuz it gives them a "rush." Bad idea guys. I mean come on, we're not 14 here, well some of us are, but that's not the point. it you want a rush, try something that won't hurt anyone besides yourself. Skydiving or bull riding are excellent examples of adrenaline junkies.  [And paintball! -Ed.]   Then you have the people who "just can't seem to help it." these people should never enter into serious relationships with boys/girls/dogs until they mature a lil bit. I'm sorry, but "I couldn't hep it" is not a valid excuse, you can always help it.  I'm just losing hope in people in general. I am starting to doubt I will ever find a nice girl who WON'T cheat on me. I've been surrounded by cheaters my whole life, and it's not a good feeling to have growing up/living with.  In short, I hope I am lucky enough to find a girl who will stay as faithful to me as I will be to her.  thank you for baring with me through all of my /'s and general ranting.
