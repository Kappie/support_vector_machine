I was shocked by two things:  Gore using the phrase  urlLink Brown Shirts  to refer to Bush supporters and staff.  How is this not made a big deal of?  Where is the outrage?  If not for Fox News I would not have known of this.  I have also heard that Teresa has made some not so kind remarks about the Kennedy's which are set to be leaked soon, that should be fun.  Also, love him or hate him, Clinton's speech was the best political speech I may have ever heard.  Outstanding.  He could possibly be the best pure "politician" ever.    No wonder they scheduled him as far away as possible from Kerry.
