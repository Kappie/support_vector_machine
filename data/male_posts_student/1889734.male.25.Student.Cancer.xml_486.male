This equivalence between a fetus in its earliest stages and a child sets a dangerous legal precedent."  A dangerous legal precedent?  To say that a fetus is a human?  I really think that should be the default position.  If the NYT and the abortion rights people want to be honest about things, THEY should advocate legislation that stipulates the moment a fetus becomes human, defining it as 'non-human' during the interval when abortion should be permissible.  It would illustrate honesty about what they hope to achieve.  And for the record, I oppose abortion as it is now defined in Roe V. Wade.  I don't believe it is a Constitutional issue.  My solution is to overturn Roe and devolve the issue to each state.  Should a state wish to have abortion into the ninth month, then that's up to the residents of that state.  I would simply move away.
