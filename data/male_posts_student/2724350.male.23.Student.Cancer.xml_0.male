It was like a dream come true because I had always wanted to do this course since graduating from secondary school. However, I found out that the higher you expect something to be, the greater the impact of disappointment if it does not meet your expectations. But, this does not mean I regret studying this course.   Through this course, I saw with my own eyes humility and compassion. Unlike those medical dramas which portray the hero/heroine in tears-inducing scenarios, what I witnessed did not turn me into a cry-baby, BUT it touched the bottom of my heart and inspired me to continue this journey. Till now(almost 2 years since I entered the course) I am still in the course though thoughts of giving up are still surfacing in my mind. But whenever I recall those touching scenes during my attachment, I pick myself up and carry on.             So, moral of the story is,  the reality may be different from your dream but never forget what you started out to achieve .
