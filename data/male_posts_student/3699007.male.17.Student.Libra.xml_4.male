Today, I don't know what I'm gonna do...just hopefully more than I did yesterday because sitting around the house is the worst thing ever.  I got my more detailed SAT scores thing in the mail today.  My verbal score was 92% higher than everybody else's in GA, so I'm thinking about applying to the journalism school at UGA, especially since I enjoy writing.  Anyway, it's 2 in the afternoon right now and I just got out of bed, so needless to say, the creative juices are not flowing.  Hopefully I'll be able to write later about whatever I did tonight and that it was fun...hopefully.  By the way, a band suggestion - The Black Keys.  2 guys, a drummer and a guitarist that also sings, and they have a very raw sound, but sound like Hendrix.  I love them, so if you like Hendrix-sounding stuff, check them out.
