I didn't do too much except mow most of the yard, which I loathe....and talk to Sherry while she was at work, at least through e-mail a little bit.  I hope it doesn't bore her to death--but hey, if somebody came to visit me at work, or just called to say hello, I'd think it was nice...if a bit weird.  Dad invited me to go to work with him tomorrow up in Lexington, but he'll have to get up really, really early to go there, and tomorrow will almost definitely be my last day off before vacation.
