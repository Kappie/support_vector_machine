Now, I can let my hair down, grab my rubber and spend some quality time alone. Yesterday there was a huge blowout fight and it got nasty. Ryan intervened and is going to talk to Peter and get him the help he needs since my methods are not working for him.  I've got a week to myself. OH, the Joy ....  I made an incredible connection with a man named Vince last night on (WRM) World Rubber Men. He saw my profile and we commenced communications. He's right up my alley, and was very intersted in talking to me. He is from NYC and is pondering a move up over the Northern Border. How auspicious the timing! We'll see what comes of that. Maybe there will be a future there. I don't know. I know better than getting my hopes up.  My little grasshopper........yes ( YOU ) has realized that sex and doing da nasty repeatedly depleats his energy and his hormone level. HA HA HA everything in moderation my friend. gotta rest and reload the gun and let it have a rest for a few days. Learning the system of the body when venturing into new territory is very important. Every thing is a give and take. Each system of the body works and reacts differently. When you ask the body to do something, you better be ready to answer to your body, when it says...ok i'm done now. time to rest or else!!! Every time we learn a new task, or pleasure and every time we ask to body to give us pleasure, it always asks for some "type" of repayment. Lao Tse says.."We can do great things, by just doing nothing."  A friend has told me that I should start writing my fiction stories again, like I had in the past to secure some free membership time on the new "rubbermen site." So sometime I have to sit down and start writing again. I wrote a 50 page story for the Mr. S Dungeon site when I was a member there under the title "Shane." if any of you are members there, you can read some of my work.  If you would like a copy of Shane for your home reading, just email me at (eragon@ca.inter.net) and i will gladly send you a copy. It's a great Leather, M/s Story.    I got my rubber catsuit back from repair yesterday. And when Ryan and Peter went out to lunch, needless to say, i was changed in 30 seconds. I did not know how much I missed feeling that rubber and sliding my body into the suit .........oh I love rubber. I can't get enough of it.         I am not sure what the future holds for me in the shape of men and relationship, but I am keeping all my options open. I have a trip planned in the near future " Funds willing " I will be able to make it. I need to sort my passport next week. I wish i had a million dollars, that would make life so much easier.  I don't have anything else to report. But I will ask something of YOU if you are reading this. I always enjoy comments and wisdom from others. So if you have something to share, if only a sentance then please, feel free to leave a note. or email me, at my home email.  Always remain teachable. For your life is over, when YOU decide that there is nothing more to learn.  In the words of Oprah Winfrey...   "Live your best life Everyday..."    See ya Jeremy  i love you jon.
