Afterall, wasn't it said ofRomario that he would be totally invisible for 88 minutes of a gameand then pop up to score the decisive goal in the last 2?  Admittedly, comparing Wolyniec to Romario may be laying it on a little thick.    Tonight's game is big for us. Chicago is in a slump and the Metrostars are, well, no one knows what we're going to see from the Metro from one game to the next. If we ever found a way to winboth ends of the home and home with Fire this week, I can't see us being caught for the rest of the season in the East. But what am I saying - we never beat Chicago, not even if they play 5 games in 7 days, and there's bound to be another 18 changes at the top of the Eastern Conference between now and the end of the season. I fully expect to seeall5 teams occupy that spot at some point from here on out.   Joe Cannon being interviewed on the SJ-Colorado pre-game by Lorrie Fair now...Cannon's long been a favorite MLS player of mine, not just because he's a decent keeper but for his bizarre  urlLink dual   urlLink sock puppet  appearance on the Bigsoccer boards a couple years ago. One was ingratiating and kind to the ultra-weird SJ fans, one ripped'em a new one for being thefreaks that they are. Well done, Mr. Schizo-goalie!  Not that you were at all incorrect about San Jose fans, by the way, Joe.    Spotting MLS players/coaches/front office types who come on to Bigsoccer  incognito is one of my favorite pastimes anyway. It's not all that frequentanoccurance, but if you've got a good eye you can sometimes pick 'em out. There's a current Metrostar who had a short but amusing run on the Metro boards before (so I hear) being told by tipped-off MFO folks to shut the hell up.    I've hearda rumor of a rumorof what the name of the new Salt Lake City teamcould be called (if a certain sports executive has his alleged way), and let me just say that, while 'traditional', it's truly absurd in its lack of realevence to Salt Lake City (at least as far as I know - and that begs the question, what the hell do I know about Salt Lake City?). If it comes to pass, I can't wait to hear the rationale behind this one. I think the SLC Punks is the obvious choice.    The Quakes are just working Colorado at the moment.
