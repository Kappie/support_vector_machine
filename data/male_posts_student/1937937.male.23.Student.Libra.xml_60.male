Then I came down south, where my family lives, to get sober.  I did it at a great hospital -- detoxed for 9 days, stayed in the residence there for three months, and then they released me.  For the first six months after I got out, I worked -- for a friend's dad.  It was a friend I'd met in rehab, and the dad was the CEO of a mid-sized company.  It was a good gig for me, paid ten bucks an hour, and I enjoyed it for a time.
