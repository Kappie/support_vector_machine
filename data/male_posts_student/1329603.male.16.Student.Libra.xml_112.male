We'll start from the very beginning (it's a very good place to start). Again, for the 4th time this term, neither mine nor Mum's alarms went off, forcing me to take the 94 into Gloucester. Upside, though, is that I got in at 0820 today, whereas last time I got in at 0905. But still, yeah. Then I had a long private study period. Not too bad. Physics mock. Which was pretty fucking solid.  Spent the entire time during lunch whizzing around, trying to locate either Sally or Rachel to discover possible rehearsal times. I also needed to tell Rachel that she'd probably be doing Last Night of The World with Scott. Couldn't find either of them, it was like trying to find 6th formers in a Primary School, although this was a Secondary School. And I still couldn't find them. General feeling was "bugger". Then, get lumbered with the fact that Pete's already put me in charge of organising the music for this light entertainment thing, and spent a ridiculously large amount of time thinking about themes, and songs people could do. My brain is wiped for ideas. Sam Taunton seems to want to fuck up my whole schedule, I'm damned if I'm going to let him take over the performances. I know he's come back from almost dying but that doesn't mean he should get all the songs. Alright, that's a little harsh, but it's taken a lot of brain power, and it's going to take a lot of the time I don't have, organising this. I don't have time for people to mess it up before I've even started. >_  THEN, after school, choir. Usually, first rehearsal back is a jolly occasion where we do sod all. Not today. We sang through the entire first number of Carmina Burana (O Fortuna), which goes up to a Bb and is the only written tenor part in an SATB lineup that I've ever seen go up there. Later, discovered that the tenor part goes up to a C! Fuck...  Get home. Alex and the kids are laughing all the time, which cuts through me like a knife. Gwen's in a piss for no reason. Bugger it, go and play the piano and get told to shut up by Jericho, who's watching the telly. I promptly respond "no" and continue practicing Last Night Of the World, which I discover to have 6 sharps. Once again, fuck, but for the reason that I CAN'T go wrong under a duet of Rachel and Scott. That'd be travesty. So I sit there, hammering away, being told that's "enough" from Alex, who's a little wanker when he wants to be. Supper. Not too bad, no reason to be pissed off at supper. Dad's constant nattering on the phone stopped me from doing my paper round. And I know that now this is all yesterday, but fuck that.  Was promptly reminded (reminded being the key word, given that I knew nothing about this until I was "reminded") that I was to put the skittles up at the St. Mary's Social thing. So, I thought, should be a laugh. Ollie and I usually natter a bit. WRONG. Ollie wasn't there, I spent my entire time feeling on my own, and (I'm not saying this is either of their faults, they're wonderful people and they didn't mind when I interjected, BUT) feeling cut out from Rhiannon and Dan conversing. Every time Dan went somewhere else, I wanted to talk to Rhiannon, I love talking to Rhiannon. But nothing came to say, and she looked at me uncomfortably, while I felt ill, wanted to retreat. I liked seeing her happy though, while she was talking to Dan. I liked seeing Dan happy while he was gloating about how strange his life as a student was. I didn't mind being cut out, so much. I did when I was interjecting and it was completely irrelevant, and I minded the look Rhiannon gave me. It was as if I was some kind of sub-human idiot. Which, it must be said, may be true, but I don't want to be reminded of the fact. And she didn't mean to do it, I'm sure she didn't, but she wanted to catch up with an old friend, which I can appreciate. In comparison to Dan (and most people, coming to think of it) I'm a little more than just a bit boring. But... I don't know, I like talking to Rhiannon, this seems more of a rant than it should.  In comparison, Mr. T's put me in for my Grade 8, taking the pressure of choice off my shoulders, I've sorted out almost all the pieces for the light entertainment, I've completed a week of my mocks already, Zoe's invited me to her B-day party, Laura's sent me an email, and I saw Rhiannon. I'm still annoyed, and very tired. But... yeah, I do have a right to be, I can be annoyed if I want. I wish I wasn't, it's all so insignificant. Heh, Dan said that I'd come home and blog about everything. Well, Dan, I did ^^.  Quote of the Day: "At the end of the day, you're another day colder, And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill. And the righteous hurry by, They don't hear the little ones crying, And the winter's coming on fast, ready to kill."  From   At the End of the Day   from the musical   Les Mis√®rables   Love, Jon Roskilly
