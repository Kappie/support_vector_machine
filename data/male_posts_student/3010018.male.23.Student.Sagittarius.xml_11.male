Sometimes i dont sleep for a day or two; other times i have this thing where i only sleep during the day time and at night time im awake all night. Its really frustrating cause like last night i was up till 5 am !! and i had class this morning....i came home and tried to sleep but only sat in my bed awake.  then i started watching tv....law and order.....nypd blue....those are two of the best shows...i love watching them, no matter what season it is...anyway back to not sleeping.....its really annoying because after a ton of hours i get this headache and it wont go away until i sleep......i used to think it was from stress that i wouldnt sleep but i dont think so....i think its the fact that my brain wont shut off......its always on...churning, thinking, working on some set of ideas or thoughts and try to reach different conclusions about things....although i rarely reach any conclusions that actually stick.  So since my mind is always working on something it helps me sleep less.....i just wish i could get some sleep at normal hours...and i havent even started talkin about my dreams..ill get to that later.
