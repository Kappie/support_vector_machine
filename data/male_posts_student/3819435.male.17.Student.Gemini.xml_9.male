Well, then I can program it where whenever you call me, your happy picture will pop up and then I will push the ignore button.  Ha, just kidding.  Maybe.  *chuckle*  Anyhoo, the days to Honor's Choir dwindle down and I get more and more excited.  I can't wait to wear my dress for all to see!  *skips*  Oh, and singing too.  Yeah.  Haha.  I also can't wait to feel the power of singing in an amazing choir.  It has been a while since I have done that.  Today I got a haircut and I have bangs now!  Exciting, eh?  I think so.  They're not creepy uniform bangs though.  I like them and I think you will too.  At least, you will if you ever want me to talk to you again.  Ha, just kidding.  Maybe.
