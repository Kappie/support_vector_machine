Essentially, you're a realist who sees the world in various shades of gray rather than black and white. While you know things don't always work out the way we anticipate, you also recognize - and use to your advantage -the power of positive thinking. You want to hope for the best, and try to keep those rose-colored glasses on as often as possible. This approach to life, should you develop it more fully, will surely give you an edge over all the negative Neds and Nancys out there; research has proven that expecting the best creates a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. You believe, for example, that the attractive stranger at a party really will call and in turn you come across as confident and approachable. You know the deal - when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Put in a little more effort to look on the bright side and you'll be heading down the right path.   Interesting. But pretty accurate I have to say.    Went to see "King Arthur" tonight. I quite enjoyed it, even though it was very different from the traditional Arthurian legends I remember reading. A good night out, in good company, especially as one of my closest friends has just returned from South Africa.    Tomorrow (well, more like today, now)is  urlLink Rach's  induction, so I will be heading up for that, and to be humiliated in a round of mini golf. The things I do for my friends!
