Meow moo meow!  At 11, I started preparing to go out to celebrate WQ's birthday (which is a day early). How meowful! I was kinda late, because I forgot to bring out WQ's prezzie out of the house and have to rush back. Heh Heh. I met KK in the busstop and we went there together. CQ, KS, HL and Gloria all got on the same bus at Woodlands Interchange.   We met WQ there. He went up to put the cake in his fridge and I also went up to put his prezzie. We went down and finds lots more cats have arrived, like PY and YC. Hmmm. Janet arrived later. We played and played basketball till 1+. HaHa. I had so many accidents. Meow moo! Now PY is my ke xin. :P I had fun. Meow moo meow!!  After that, we went up to WQ's house to eat cake and meow. WQ don't get offended ar, but the way his grandmother 'scolds' him is really really funny. Nah, don't quote her la, don't wanna embarass WQ. I laughed and laughed, and we laughed and laughed. It must be real embarassing for him. Anyway, that's not the focal point. Heh Heh.   WQ ordered pizza for us. Of course, I had it as Hawaiian. No way I am eating other types. :P While waiting for the pizza to arrive, we meowed and listened to songs on WQ's computer. When it arrived, WQ's mother and grandma cooked fried beehoon and fries for us. OOO! After some pushing, everyone starts eating. How meowful. Hmm...after eating, we rest for awhile before doing the b-dae celebrations. Oh yes, PY left earlier.  Well, after some while, we finally get to eat the meowing mango cake. HaHa. I wonder what wish WQ made. I wanna know. :P Anyways, we ate the meowing cat. Gloria cut the cake and presented it to WQ. Hmm. She gave me a slice and put it on a tissue paper. I said i don't want (I already said I don't want any cake on a tissue paper, i can't stand it). Meow meow meow. After meowing at the cake, WQ opened his prezzie. He was surprised and shocked. He didn't expect to get the present. He even forgot he told me he liked it. HAHA! He likes it, so I am very happy. We are happy. :D  Hmm. We played his PS2. Janet, KK, Gloria and HL left, leaving only me, CQ and KS. We played Sonic Heroes and Street Fighters. HaHa. We have to wait for a while to go off, because I want to use the toiet, but WQ's mother is bathing. HaHa. I get to use the toilet at 5.40+. Meow moo!   We left soon after. CQ walked back home, and ME and KS took 911E to Woodlands Interchange. I took 913 (very crowded) back home. I went back, bathed, watched TV and ate dinner.   I then came online. Just now, I mopped the kitchen floor and my father is "supervising". Honestly! I will never mop the kitchen floor as long as he is there again! All he does was critisize how I mop the floor. My way works just fine! Hmmmpp! I downloaded two SHE songs from WQ and is now downloading the Bo Shi Mao MTV. I wanna learn how to dance the chorus. Anyways, I was playing back all the SHE songs I have and the one which struck out is Lian Ren Wei Man. Such a beautiful song. I love it very much! :)  Hmm. I think I end this blog le. I enjoyed today. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
