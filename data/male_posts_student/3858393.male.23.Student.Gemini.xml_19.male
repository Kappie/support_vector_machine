(Rollercoaster Tycoon 2) I know it's just cuz my computer SUX! It just plain sucks. I hope that I get a new computer SOON.. I would do anything for that... I see the people on television that are at those QUAKECON thingies and I wonder how they get enough money! They have all those NEON lights inside of the computer and they have their name inscribed on the metal on the outside of the box. I wish I had one of those! It would soooo ROCK! But, I don't I'm sitting here with this gay-ass Gateway Astro... I can't believe that Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 doesn't work on my computer... It has the worst graphics ever! O well, I guess I just have to put up with this for now... BUT WHY!?!?!?! My mom just called, she said that the person she works with thinks that it's a broken shortcut. It's not I've tried clicking on the main icon, it still doesn't work... Noone is reading this... I know it, only two of my friends read this. They probably don't remember the link... I'm talking to myself... How wonderful... Well, I guess it's time for a random word in the dictionary!  grace (gras) n. 1. Beauty of movement or form. 2. Mercy; clemency. 3. Temporary immunity. 4. Divine love and protection.  Ooooo. Interesting! I'm bored... I like reading other people's blogs... I don't know why. I guess that's why I like "The Sims" and I read message boards a lot... They blow me away with how many posts they've written... I have like 8 and I still have about 2,000 words... I write alot of words. I would make a good boyfriend... I listen to boring shit a lot... Modest Mouse for instance. I know that they're really boring. But I still like them. I think that it's really cool that they're like #18 on the billboard charts with "Good News for People Who Love Bad News". I think that's sooo cool. I feel good for them because I don't think that they got the recognition that they deserved until now... They have great music and they didn't get discovered until "Float On"... I think that is soooo awesome... You guys kno my dad is in the Military, he's doing the Crucible now. I guess it sucks, hes not gonna be here for another 5 days. But he was in Afganistan before, thats worse. My mom is hoping to talk to him when he gets back about visiting my grandparents in Pittsburgh. I really think that we can wait until Christmas to visit and get a new computer now... That would be awesome! We can get an Alienware computer!!! HOW SWEET! I wonder if they have CD burners!? AWESOME! I think that every computer has a CD burner now. I don't! I know this great website that I can use injunction with a CD burner.... www.allofmp3.com It's cool... Check it out.... I have been writing a lot.. I don't wanna stop but I don't have anything else to write about! OK CYA!
