The Illustrator help file gives a basic over view of how it works but just by experimenting it is not always obvious what the tools in there actually do.     One of the most useful tools is the Subtract from Shape Area tool. This tool takes the front most object and subtracts it from the backmost object when 2 objects are selected. This allows anything in the background to show through. This is important if any white areas in the illustration are just supposed to be whatever color the background is instead of the ink color white.
