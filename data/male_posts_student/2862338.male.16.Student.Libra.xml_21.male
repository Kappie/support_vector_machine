Alot of shit happened now that i think about it....let me explain....last night..because i went to the gym pretty late....i came home late, which, as u guessed, didn't let me do my HW. well, the plan was, skip first period, get APUSH, english, earth science AND math done, and still have 2nd period free to finish up....didn;t turn out that way...i spent BOTH periods trying to come up with that damn essay....and shit man, i didn;t even get shit done.  Jones (thank god) still had an extra copy of HIS essay, and i juss used that as a model to work mine off of (i must say jones, you are an excellent essay writer...you get a  urlLink A+!)  anyway, so i got that done...next was spanish....what can i say? that was pretty cool i guess.  I acutally talked to Claudia, (she always go to the back to talk wit Chen) it was pretty cool...nothing like last year (dun even get me started on THAT) but pretty good. I asked Pos if i could go down to the water machine, and get a bottle, and he was like no, so she offered me some of her Diet Pepsi...i said no (in a nice way ofcourse, always making her smile :) ) but it mad me think.....you  KNOW  your in good with someone if they offer there drink.  She's a  urlLink Super freind,  and so much more.  Last year, we always sat next to each other, always worked together...ya, need i say more? anyway, ya, thats my thoughts about that, like i said,, she's juss a great person....SUPER sexual though (but thats a good thing, right?) anyway, nothing after that happened....i guess it's worth mentioning a dream she breifly mentioned, of how she lost her teeth in it, and how it meant that a freind was gonna die.  I asked her how she knew, and she said it was in her dream book.....i was juss like....wow.  If you don't know the story of me and dreams, allow me to explain.  Acouple of years ago, i was watching montel (i think it was after school, cause it was usually on at that time) and this lady,  urlLink Sylvia Browne  was on, telling people's futures, and how to interpret dreams.....now, don;'t ask me WHY, or HOW, but for some reason, i belived EVERYTHING this lady said...it was an overwhelming feeling of trust, and belief, that it inspired me to want to learn more...atleast about the dream part.  So anyway, after that, i bought some cheap dream book, and then her new book  about dreams. (the one she was talking about on Montel.) So anyway, i get this book, and read it NON-STOP, like, literally, didn;t stop reading it till i got to the end,  It was crazy, but i loved reading, i wanted more SOO bad.  Well, ya, after that i told everyone about my enlightenment, no one really cared thoguh, acouple of the guys told me some of thier dreams, but i didn;t really know what to say, cause ofcourse, i'm no expert...but ya, after that, i end up buying another one of her books (she has ALOT of books) called On the Other side and Back which tells how it's like when you die, and what happens, how it's like, and what she expeirenced during some off her dreams.  Totally changed my life....and i can truly say that, if it wasn;t for that book...i would still be afraid of dieying...and thats NO lie...now i'm calm about it, hell, i'm looking foward to it (and she says theres no devil either...very intresting shit) and NO, i'm not suicidal, so let's not go there...But ya, so thats the mini-story on that, really changed my life, i STRONGLY suggest readin those books..if not becuase you like it...atleast it's intresting to read.  Anyway, ya, back to school...i was acutally pleasently suprised when she said that....VERY...but i can't really do anything about it....as much as i want to...damn..she's great....BUT YA, where both libras...i dunno why i juss typed that, maybe it'll help u iunderstand alittle i guess, we have alot in common, plus i heard 2 libra have the best sex.(O YEAH) and good god, i have heard stories of that girls sexualness...god damn i want.  see, what i like most about her, is juss like me, she juss likes feeling good, she likes pleasure, so she'll get crazy with ya, and everything, and she's def. not afraid of bieng naked and what not...good god, i swear, if i could, i'd marry that girl...i'm gonna miss her when she goes...but anyway, after that, went to earth science where i felt like an ass....not cause i MADE an ass of myself, but becuase i got jealous for no reason at all....see, me and shawna have grown to the relationship level, of , about...i'd say "freinds"  so ya, i'm obviously pretty happy abou that, considering i've liked this girl (along with everyother guy) since like, AMD, but never acutally never talked to her.  But ya, now i do, and she even always wants to work with me on labs and stuff.  And i first, i was like, kick ass, but then i realized, i think she wants to be nearer to Scott.  Scott is a new 10th grader that came from steppanack.  Mad cool, he;s mad good people.  anyway, to me, it looks like she likes him (even though she goes out with adam)  so yeah, i saw them "flirting" and i was like "fuck" but whatever, even if she was in to him, she can;t act on her feelings with out breakn' up with adam, so ya, i dun even care now...maybe i was jealous cause i was tired or something.  Anyway, i go to Music class next period, where, again, i feel like an ass.  I had MAD energy, prolly from being very jealous, so i was jusst playing mad fast, and doing all this random shit, the reason i felt like an ass is cause i think jorge thought i was trying to show off or something, when all i was trying to do was get rid of some steam...i might be wrong, but i saw a face on him that looked like he was thinking 'and he thinks I show off?" so ya, jorge if your reading this, you now know why i was doing that.  But ya, other than that, nothing else happned till 7th period.  By this time, i had my Essay all written up..all i need was to type it.  Rob (fortunatly) still has Jake's Log - on, so i juss used that to type it.  I still had Math though..so i was typing a mile a minute thrying to finish the damn thing.  Whats great was, mike, too, had math HW to do (we have the same teacher) and did it, and while i was typing the thing, he gave me the answers to the math thing, and even though it was wrong, i still got it "done", so mike, thnx again man.  anyway, then comes last period.  nothing special here, other than Jones told me Andy is going to The navy in july.  we were like, "shit, this sucks! it's andy!" but shit, i envy him...i wish i knew what i wanted to do with my life....i have no fucking clue yet...well, ya, then after that, waitied for jones in the TV studio with andy waiting for jones cause he had the car today, and he was gonna give us a ride...MASTURBATION (inside joke).  So we eventually go, and end up driving around ossining a bit...thats right...juss randomly driving.....we drive soem more, then we see a STUDENT DRIVER car! so we go following it, and after a turn, we learn it's elizibeht Lawrence! ya, crazy, she ends up turning, and loos her, thats when we stopped by 7 eleven, i pick up a slurpee (very nasty by the way) and a sandwhich. we drive some more, drop of andy, drop of me, and here i am.  So thats about it. DUn have alot of HW tonight....and i'm gonna go to the gym prolly...oh! and also try to fixe up the page (sorry for Mr. Jackson Up there).  So ya, i'll write later if i want...peace
