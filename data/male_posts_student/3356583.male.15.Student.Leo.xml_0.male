I now know the people i need in life.Those who are shittin behind my back.I now have no fear.No hesitation.Nothing to lose.Everything to gain.School?Wad is it to me?Cigs?I want them.Sex?Im giving her supersized.Drinks?Oh god i hope im not an alcoholic.Drugs?I don't do them.Music?Many of them are shit.I am so high.Life's taking its toll on me.Im waiting for the time to snap.I'll take u on.Even if u're van damme.These past weeks.I've learned alot of new things.Met alot of new people.People who once i tot wouldn't ever be my friends.The people that i once looked down upon.They were in fact in many ways superior to me.It seems like i've been wiped off from the faced of this world.Returned.Wiser smarter and stronger.Discpline once i tot was not for me.Now im living in it.To the way i wanna go.No one can stop me.Im not ready for tommorow.And i cant control thinking about yesterday.Where do i wanna be?Who do i wanna be with?In fact i dont really know.Dont u go away.Every  mistake.Seems so big now.As the days were longing.I think about the things caught in my mind.Damn my education.The chicks i got to meet.I don want to be there when u hit the ground.You cant make things right.Neither could i.I've learned to appreciate every minute of my life.These past 2 weeks were really meningful to me.Get on the roller coaster.I've been better known to beat the brain.Today is just a daydream.I've seen people whoreally have repented in life.Singing rapsodies.The people who real fighters whoave nothing to lose.Im starting to evolve into them.Throwing it all away.The gals who are daring sick and psycotic.The people who have to spend years in research for their souls.Holding on.For dear life.Apart from all these.They are the people who you can really trust.Cos when all of the stars have faded away.They are the people who'll bring them back some day.The fire in my heart is out.I've never really had a doubt.If you had the chance to save me would do it?Knowing i could never save u in return.if u did. All i've to say is "thankyou"
