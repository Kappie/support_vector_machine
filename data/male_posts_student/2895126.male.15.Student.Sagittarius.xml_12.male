I played this one girl who was obviously a beginner, so I ended up feeling rather bad after crushing her. There was one point in the game where I had either the option to take her rook with my bishop or, simply, not. I pondered for about two minutes, and decided to do it. I remember what square it was too, F8. Hmm, ethics: you can win, but you have to feel bad about it.
