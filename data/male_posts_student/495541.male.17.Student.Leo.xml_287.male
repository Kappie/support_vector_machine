It's also cluttered with cables and cords and extensions and unused electronics.  Old stuff too.  Things from about ten years ago.  Some things even older.  A great number of the more recent stuff is from eBay.  eBay is the king of crap.  There is so much junk available on that website, it's sickening.  For five bucks you can get yourself something twenty years old to your doorstep.  You can do that all for five bucks, plus ten bucks shipping.  I'm getting sick of the same things.  Doing the same things.  Doing the same things.  Doing the same things.  Mowing the lawn every week.  Cleaning every week.  Changing everything every day.  Washing yourself every day.  Doing everything every day because if you don't, bad bacteria is going to get you.  Don't be misled, I'm not saying good hygiene is a bad thing.  I'm simply saying there's been an accumulation of crap people have to do everyday.  Wake up, brush your teeth (and floss and mouth-wash), shower (if that's how you do it), wash your hair, comb it, jell it, cologne, socks, shoes, shirts, pants.  I'm probably missing something.  I do it every day so unconsciously.  Eat something for breakfast.  Make sure it doesn't have any carbs.  If you have carbs, it's the end of the diet.  Atkins is going to kill you.  Read the headline, make sure the world isn't ending, and jump in the car.  Maybe you should go to StarBucks and have a drink that you don't have any idea what the ingredients are.  You still have no idea why you're not losing weight with the diet.  Blah blah blah blah.  Routine routine routine.  Hope nothing goes wrong with the routine.  It happens to me.  I drive in an area I'm not used to and I'm 200% more likely to get in an accident.  Hopefully the spell checker knows how to spell accident.  I keep spelling it accient.  It always makes me wonder how the Chinese use their computers.  Considering they don't have an alphabet, I'm sure it's harder to get up to 70 words a minute.  Maybe they have a different system of typing.  Maybe it's KANJI per minute!  Excellent.  Or maybe everyone who uses a computer in China knows English and they have to know it to use our computers.  I guess they really aren't all our computers.  Half the parts are made in Singapore and Taiwan.  Japan, Korea, and China.  They're just ours... sort of.  Today's the first complete day of summer.  One of only about 80 or less days we get off from school.  School sucks.  It doesn't suck but it's structured enough for me to hate it.  You have to do this stuff, or you're going to be an outcast in society.  It used to be almost no one passed 'high school' but now almost everyone does.  The significance of high school has diminished.  If you don't have college on your resume, you won't get the job you want.  The job that pays the most and the job that you think will get you the happiness everyone tells you that you want.  Why do we have to have ID cards?  Why do we have to have e-mail addresses and cell phone numbers?  We've got these things because we're all needed by each other.  We all depend on each other for certain things.  Often it's a job, which gives you money and gives you food and happiness.  Then it's just random people that we depend on for things like love and other happiness.  The point of it all is never apparent.  Somehow we're supposed to strive for all these things and then the point is supposed to show up.  Now I need to find myself a job and attempt what everyone else is doing.
