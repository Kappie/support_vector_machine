I talked to him today about the possibility of seeing him, and he said that he can’t be sure of my honesty, can’t be sure if I am just paying lipservice about starting a new relationship with him. He can’t take that chance that I will hurt him, because I have caused him so much pain already (a very close paraphrase of what he said on the phone). Bleeding eh! Oh well, happy Hamilton to all of you.
