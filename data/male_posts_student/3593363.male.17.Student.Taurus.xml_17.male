Yep.  I've been thinking a lot about what i want to do with my life. I really don't know. Lindsey and Allie tell me to be a pastor, ive been told phychologist,Some guy named frank told me to enlist to find out what to do, Lenny tells me just find a college and don't worry about your major, and I myself don't even know. I hope it comes to me fast.  I also want to start a band. I've tried like 5 times. I need a drummer, and a few others. A band, perhaps
