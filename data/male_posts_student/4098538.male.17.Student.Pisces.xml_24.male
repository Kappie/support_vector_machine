Last time around they were amazing even though they were only on stage for about half an hour. Today I am hoping for at least another hour on top. I can't even wait any longer, it's driving me mad! I got their collectors double disc edition on Friday and it's really quite amazing! Has some cool tracks and the live tracks are awesome. I'm on the meet and greet list for the show tonight which is so fucking fantastic, THANK YOU SAMI! That means I get to go backstage and hang out with Chimaira a few hours before they go on stage! WOW! I'm so hyped about this show. It's gonna be incredible! I'll post all about ittomorrow!
