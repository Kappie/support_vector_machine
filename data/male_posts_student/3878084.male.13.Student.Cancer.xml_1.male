Then Andrew got me even more pissed after he told Eileen who has been cuming longer than him to go to a different room when it was only his 3rd day. So I ignored him for the rest of the day. Then i got picked up at 4 came home and their was this huge thunderstorm rite over my house. I called Jordan to cum get me which he did. Then we went bac to his house and did absoloutly nuthin. Then finally we went to the mall IT WAS SO BORING!!! We didnt do anything! Well Jordan got new school shoes.
