I was so totally bored that I was meowing for attention. Apparently, when WQ came online, I was so estatic! Finally! A cat to talk to! My happiness fell short when he announced that he's gonna play games. Meow moo!! Luckily, at that time, Charms class started, and I kept myself busy. HaHa. I even got Prof Snapeluva's MSN add. Too bad she's working, we can't chat much.  Hmmm. At 2, I went on to play my FFX. Oh, it was kinda good. I managed to get LuLu learn the second level elemental magics (Fira, Thundara, etc) and oh boy! They consumed so much MPs. I need to use Fira to deal with the Orchu and my Mps have depleted a lot!! Luckily, I made it to the Save Sphere in time. How meowful. I need to level up more! How meowful!  Yes Yes. After playing, I came online, bathed, ate dinner and meow back online. I found out that Sundays (I did not sleep on Saturday...so Saturday does not apply) generally means success, which means that my dreams usually means success in my actions. How revealing! Yes!! Meowful too.  You know what? WQ called me "bo liao" for believing in dreams. He also told me to stop being so kaypoh. I felt so affronted! I felt so insulted! I believe that dreams reveal a lot about the person, and also a small premonition to the future. What would you have felt if I called your belief "rubbish"? Me being kaypoh is part of being KY. I CANNOT not be kaypoh! If you ask me not to be kaypoh, you are telling me "Don't be yourself. Be someone else instead". Yes! That's how serious it is! I hope WQ consider what is he gonna tell people in the future, because his words might unintenionally hurt people's feeling (and make them angry too). Meow!!  Alright. I am going off to watch my sitcoms. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
