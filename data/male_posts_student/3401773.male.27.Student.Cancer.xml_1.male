After the exam, walking back to my bike I found the front wheel missing (quick-release, knew it would happen eventually). Stupid thing was that it was chained right outside a security camera, so my first thought was to hunt it down in some nearby hedge or go find out who had access to the video. I eventually found it propped up against a wall being badly hidden by a group of young lands who I saw only moments earlier knocking bikes over! Needless to say, they didn't put up much of a fight when I simply walked over, picked it up and disappeared with it. Just glad i got it back, would hate to have to walk, or worse, catch stinky expensive busses!  The day is over but it seems I just don't know it yet. The tail-tail signs i should probably take note of are when i'm surfing the net looking at the prices of breadbins on Froogle! *boggle*  I'll grab a cold drink and blow some people up in Desert Combat for 30min before i hit the hay i think.  Night ;)
