For them to become strong writers in three weeks would be incredible, and probably won't happen.  So I'm all about planting seeds...teaching outline writing, focusing on craft, and introducing them to a world of art and culture they don't realize exists.  They'll leave TIP as the cool kids.    Hole in the Wall last night for beers with Brian, expecting neighbors Holly and Lunchbox to be there...we got Katie instead, which isn't bad at all, just contrary to expectations.  A student of mine from last semester worked the bar, hooking me up with rounds of free drinks, until I passed her the $5 tip, and she said it wasn't enough to cover my tab.  Fair enough.  She had a B in my class.    Brian and I enjoy ranking systems...and the phrase "in a pinch."  Ever so often, we'll pass someone (usually not attractive), and he'll throw out "1 through 10, what pinch must it be?"  I'm pretty tough to get for pinches, because I don't throw my manly weight around too coquettishly...I can withstand famine-like pinches.    Last night, Brian points out a girl sititng with the party we composed of.  "1 through 8, in a pinch?"  I looked at the girl, who I had looked at a lot that night, and couldn't help but smile at Brian.  "No pinch necessary there," I said, laughing as Brian wasn't privy to the information I held.    "You're right," Brian said, and reveled in the girl's hardlined sexiness.    ---  One of my better posts of recent came on April 25, when I met up at neighbor porch party with sexy stoned girl.  The passing of a month helped me forget such childish things, as lament isn't a verb I use to describe my actions.  She was hot, she was into me, she had a boyfriend.  It sucked that day, and it was over.  I wasn't going to see her again.  Except there she was at Hole in the Wall, her boyfriend playing pool with his brother, who dates Katie.  I did my best to stay away from Amy, knowing things couldn't go well (depending on your point of view, it might be things that go real well).  Clearance was figured when I saw boyfriend smother his hippie queen in arms and deep kisses after most pool shots.  And I was on the other side of the party conversation, telling my sardonic jokes and keeping the drunks entertained.    Of course she didn't see fit to keep things at bay.  She walked over, and we started conversation quickly.  And there was a lot of touching on her part...hand on my arm, hand on my back, hand in my hand.  Hand on my ass.  Hand again on my ass.  Hand sliding from the back to the ass.  Hand dangling against the crotch.    I was of little reciprocation, constantly fighting the moral battle in my mind, knowing I have no affiliation to home dude, knowing I will be gone in six days, knowing that the glory of a round with said home chick would be nothing short of exquisite, exquisite of course a euphamism for FUCKING GLORIOUS!  All the while understanding the call of the society, knowing what paths you push, and what roads you leave barren.  My compromise to the situation was that I would allow whatever was going on, all the while doing nothing to provoke, if we can assume that charm and charisma is not a mitigating factor of the scenario =)    They left early, once again me shaking the boyfriend's hand, a firm, eye to eye, no hard feelings handshake.  I left it with her in a handshake, but not a firm handshake, and not really a shake at all...just a hand.  Inside of another hand.  Held for several seconds.  We let go, I smiled.  She got her purse.  Then came back and hugged me tight.  No words said.  The hand slipped to the butt again.  A few circles and a pinch.  I could only pat her shoulder and attempt to hide any enjoyment had.    He's got to understand if he's with her.  I'm not a bad guy.  He's a sexy beast; I'm most attractive when you combine the personality with the looks rather than let one hold court.  She's looking for both possibly, or she just craves attention (seemingly odd, as the two times I've met her she has played WallFlower perfectly, only emerging to twist tongues with me).    Whatever the case.  I go home unhappy, loathing the situation, understanding that one slight twist of the givens has hippie chick spending my last night with my twin bed with me.  Today, I wake up, alone, smiling the shit-eating grin, understanding that the ego boost she provides can be a bittersweet enough.
