Even as handheld devices become more powerful each day, the beige box is working harder to woo users once more with unbridled power.   Equipped with faster processors, improved memory modules and speedier graphics cards, the PC of the next 12 months will bring more performance to gamers, photo buffs and just about anyone - even if they only use the PC to surf the Web.   Need for speed   Expect processor clock speeds to touch 4GHz. Intel's 3.4GHz 'Prescott' Pentium 4 is the current speed king for the giant chip maker. So 4GHz by next year is not an impractical target, if you ask chip makers.   Being produced in a 90-nanometer process means the latest iteration of the Pentium 4 generates less heat than previous Pentium 4 chips. So, higher speeds, beyond 3GHz, are possible.   Performance is also helped by having more cache memory on the chip - 16KB for level 1 and 1MB for level 2.   Intel's rival, AMD, is also expected to come up with an equivalent performer - just like it did previously when Intel raised the stakes in the gigahertz race.   Whether it will come up with a 4000+ rating is unclear. But AMD fans can probably rest assured that, as the 'alternative' chip maker out there, it will come up with a processor that matches Intel's performance at a lower price.   Memory makeover   On the memory front, PC buffs will hear more about DDR2-SDRAM - an update to the popular DDR-SDRAM (double data rate synchronous dynamic random access memory) available on most motherboards now.   Already used in high-end graphics cards, DDR2 memory offers speedy access to data when used as system memory on a PC motherboard. The bad news is, the transition to a PC may take longer than initially expected.   Initial DDR2 modules sporting 400MHz speeds will actually perform slower than current DDR modules running at the same speed. No thanks to the increased latency associated with the technology.   Only with speeds of at least 533MHz, according to some reports, will DDR2's benefits be obvious to PCs. Because of the complexity of producing memory modules running at these speeds, vendors may take until next year to offer DDR2 to the mass market.   On the bright side, Intel has DDR2 in its roadmaps and AMD has run tests on DDR2.   More eye candy   This year, great visuals are also in store for PC gamers. This is especially important for the discerning gamer.   ATI and Nvidia recently announced graphics processing units (GPUs) that will come just in time for such gamers, who are willing to fork out $700 to $800 for the best visual experience.   If Doom 3 and Half-Life 2 are launched - they are expected in the coming months - the extra muscle will be needed to run these visually rich games that demand the most expensive GPUs out there.   This is a cue for the ATI X800 XT and Nvidia 6800 Ultra Extreme - the fastest GPUs to power graphics cards now.   Of course, all the data that is processed by the cards need to be quickly transported around the PC. This is where the PCI Express bus, the replacement for AGP (advanced graphics port) and PCI (peripheral component interconnect) come in.   With PCI Express graphics cards (and possibly soundcards) plugged into a motherboard that supports the new technology, users can remove a potential performance bottleneck on their PCs. PCI Express chipsets and motherboards are already available. Now, it's a matter of peripherals catching up.   Why more power?   So, why the need for all that performance? It's the same reason why people upgrade from any old PC to a new one: The need for speed is insatiable.   For techies, the new technologies are a boost to ageing PC standards. AGP has been around for six years. DDR-SDRAM for over two years. A big performance upgrade, if you ask a PC enthusiast, is always welcome.    EXPECT THIS   Here are some components you may find in a high-end PC in the next 12 months.    Intel Pentium 4 4GHz or AMD Athlon 64 FX 4000+ (possible specs) 2GB DDR2-SDRAM memory (running at 667MHz) ATI X800 XT/ Nvidia 6800 Ultra Extreme 400GB Hitachi hard disk Dual-format DVD writer 19-inch LCD monitor Windows XP with SP2   These are not vapourware products. With the exception of the processor and memory modules, the other components are already available or have actual production samples.   The next monster PC you own might well sport some of them
