That was interesting, ironically i can't remember what we talked about...oh well, i'm sure i'll remember in a bit...hmm another thing i did with my boring day i took my dog to the groomers. The little bugger scratched my wrists and made me bleed,oh well i'm ok, i didn't die from it. Although i'll probably die later from shooting my foot off at the range. Damned rifles never shoot straight! so ya thats my blah for now, i'm not sure what else to write really, oh well off for now...
