Then I'd have to quit biking, or get a clone of myself to do it. grrr...  Eh, the only notable thing from yesterday that I missed was that I injured my knee playing football in biology. Yes, biology. Locking knees isn't fun. I couldn't extend my leg fully until last night.  Today: 1. Had a drum lesson 2. did chores 3. avoided homework 4. Chops concert  yeah, not a real action-packed day, but the concert was really fun. Ok, so maybe Chops wasn't quite as good as I thought they would be, but hey. MN Brass nearly blew my eardrums out...geez they're loud. I don't think they need any more mellophones.  More about music. I honestly think I have the ability to pick of most any instrument and learn to play it. Like the trumpet, or the saxophone, or the bari sax, or the mellophone, or the-whatever. I also find it nerve-racking to be a spectator to something you know you can be in, like Chops, and do well in it and have fun. Idk what I'd play-I might learn brass this summer, or maybe I'll get crazy-good on the snare or quads. But thats just it. That quote really has meaning: "Music is life. The rest is accidental." Yeah, music is my life, and I'm joining chops!!!
