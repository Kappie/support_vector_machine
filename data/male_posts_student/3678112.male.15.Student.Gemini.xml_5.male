However, as with all the Nova Logic games, the feel is not as smooth as the venerated UT2004. Controls feel clanky, and the animations are average. If you are a diehard Bf1942 fan, then don't pass this game up. However, if you are a dedicated shooter fan that likes a quality game like UT2004 or the more real variety like Rainbow Six, and America's Army then pass this game up.
