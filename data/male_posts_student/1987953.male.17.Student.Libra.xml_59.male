Thursday I got my class ring from  urlLink Baltimore Lutheran  in the mail... FINALLY! We kept trying to decide if I should buy the ring or get one from Edgewood High and tell Balfour I didn't want the Baltimore Lutheran ring after all. I don't like that idea. Baltimore Lutheran was where I went for three years, plus eight years in their feeder school, Bethlehem Christian, and even though I am "graduating" from Edgewood High, Baltimore Lutheran is where my heart is and where all my friends are (even though two are mad at me because I didn't have a lot of time to really keep in touch... who agrees there's more behind it than that?).   Anyway, I heard about something else that's mentionable. In Baltimore, where I grew up, in an area not too far away from where I grew up, a girl had a party with some friends over. They were playing truth or dare, and a friend of the girl who threw the party was dared to kiss the boyfriend of the girl who threw the party. She did. The mother of the girl who threw the party told her daughter to "take care of business," and so both the woman and her daughter started beating up the friend. Another grown woman and two girls jumped in and started beating her up too. This went on for several minutes until the girl's sister came to pick her up and saw it happening. She saw blood coming from just about every part of her sister's face. She called the police. The girl went into the hospital unconscious, but is now conscious. Arrests were made. Isn't that the kind of thing that makes you want to go down there and slam the heads of the two grown women into walls and see how THEY like it?  Anyway, I have to go. I'll talk to you all later! Blog ya later! Maybe tomorrow!  In Christ, Mike >
