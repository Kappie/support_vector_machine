I wanted to do things naturally, to just go to the gym. Now I'm going to start taking....Protein supplements! Yes, at first you though steroids. But no, no steroids for I. I like my testicles the way they are: existant. Hopefully the extra protein will help me put on some muscle, I just hope I don't get really fat. Perhaps a low intensity supplement would be best, since I'll lose most of it in my urine anyways, and I don't want to change my diet too drastically all at once.        Enough of that boring jazz. Lets get some ranting off our minds.   Lets rant about....HIM.   Here He is, complaining about how he gets bad grades in school and that he can't learn. Let's take English, for example.   Maybe He would learn things a little better if he didn't sit there talking and reading magazines all day! Maybe if he actually put his mind to it, he would do good. What does it matter how much concentration he puts into it anyways, it's English! He SPEAKS English! My best guess would be that he is doing this as an excuse to get closer to her. You know, late night study sessions, dependance, nurturing. It makes better sense.   He puts more god damned effort into that band of his than he does into his schoolwork. His band...He's got the whole punk rock thing going on, and yet still he insists on listening to rap music! He's in a punk band! Gahh...     Ok, so hes got this thing where, if emotionally overstimulated or really scared or whatever, he goes into this like drug induced state. I was skeptical at first when he told me this. In fact, I (obviously) still am. Sometimes I think he's just full of shit. I won't believe him until I see some medical records. But that's just the way I am. He couldn't even name the malfunctioning part of his brain that was causing the problem! It's the amygdala! Everyone knows that!!!   Now, we'd known each other for quite some time, but it was only in recent months when he told me of this. When I think back (often to before he told me), I can think of a number of occurances which would have triggered one of his episodes, but didn't.   We are all in the drama room, and this big guy storms in and starts yelling at Him, telling him he's gonna beat the shit out of him. For starters, getting threats like those would have been enough, but there's more to my suspision than that. Before He came here, he would get beat up an awful lot, which is apparently the cause of his condition. Having people threaten you would surely bring brack the trauma of such events, further stimulating the episode. No reaction.   Then, there's the subject of his mother. Now, here she is, yelling at him and treating him like garbage, when she knows full well that she could trigger an episode, or possibly even kill him. KILL. Yes, it HAS come close. Doesn't she know? Doesn't she?   Plus, why isn't he taking any sort of preventative medication? Some depressants or something. He has MORE than enough money to pay for medical treatment of any sort. The docs say that another good blow to the head could indeed kill him. One of my friends bashed his head against the wall pretty darn good one time. He ain'tlookin any worse to me.   Then there's this one time he trips on a skateboard in his hallway in the dark (I know, I know), and whacks his head on the wall. No bleeding, no concussions, just a good bump on the 'noggin. Yet, he goes into one of his episodes, craziness and all. My guess would be to garner attention. "Help me, love me, I'm a wounded dove..." HA! Do you have any idea just how thick and how strong a human skull IS. You have to hit that thing pretty fuckin hard to do any damage, not to mention that the most you will do without killing yourself is a concussion. And he was just fine the next day, so that rules THAT option out.      ...She may have wanted it, you bastard, but you could have stopped it at any time. Ya know. Use some JUDGEMENT. YOU. YOU. YOU. YOU. YOU.      Here I am, dispensing more and more hate, yet again. It appears I, myself, am no better.
