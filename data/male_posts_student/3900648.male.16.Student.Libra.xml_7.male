My connection rarely lasts longer than 10 minutes, most of the time closer to 3, sometimes as low as 10 seconds between modem restarts (meaning i have to get up, walk around my desk, and flip the power switch off and on).  This is simply ridiculous.  I looked up my modem online, and found a useful review explaining that it cannot be within three feet of any electronic device.  My modem was sitting right next to my desktop tower.  Ok, I can fix that I thought.  Nope.  The modem from hell noticed I was shopping for modems online.  "Mozilla firefox could not load the page."   Ok then.  So the search for a usable modem continues.  Although--I'm afraid to say it at the moment, but it would appear that my modem likes its new spot away from the computer...sailing post to come tomorrow.
