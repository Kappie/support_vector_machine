There will be no blogging for aroundabout a week, as first half is spent in Belgium and second half is spent... doing other things so I'm busy. Sorry to all my devoted readers... well, Sam and Miller.  Miller hasn't blogged in a while *waits*  Sam told me in so many words to grow some balls and ask Caroline out. Some people can be really charming, can't they? Bloody hell...  Scott wasn't in because... well, he's ill, the poor lad. Everybody say aw. *hugs Scott*  I shouted at Caroline yesterday, but I won't go into it in detail because I'm knackered so I'll just say that she didn't mind ^_^.  I wonder who Zoe's got her eye on... Ooh, on the subject of Zoe, if you're reading... INVITE ME TO WEIRD HALLOWEEN DO! It's such an odd thing to say!  Went for a walk with Sam earlier. Twas good fun, got to say g'bye to Cheltenham for a bit.
