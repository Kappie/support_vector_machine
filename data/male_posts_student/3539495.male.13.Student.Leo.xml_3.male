But aside from that, the come with nice comfy ear pads, the sound quality is supposedly excellent, and they're light. They are also foldable, small enough to fit into a jacket pocket easily. The bass is a little lighter than most headphones, but an equalizer solves that problem. Sold at www.audiocubes.com . Sony discontinued making these, so they're in limited stock. Which reminds me I need money soon... urlLink
