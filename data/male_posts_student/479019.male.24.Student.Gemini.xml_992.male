You really don't know who is reading your blog. This thought came up as I looked at the referrals to my blog, and see weird Google search queries, and individual IP address hits.  Now playing:  Alkaline Trio  - Warbrain  The cyber lurking is weird, but at the same time, I don't have much to hide. I'd like to think I'm myself on here. I don't post anything here, that I wouldn't have a problem saying to someone in person. There is very little self censorship on my part.   Ok more managerial ranting. Our manager was supposed to be in at 7 AM, but didn't arrive until 11 AM. This was a day after implying to a co-worker that if she called in sick, she could lose her job. Talk about hypocrisy. The only good thing about it was he was around to criticize our work without doing any work himself.  Now playing:  Bad Religion  - The Fast Life  I guess the dumbass working there made it so that I won't miss leaving the job next, next week. I really had a great time working there this summer. I have awesome co-workers, the regular customers are awesome, and nothing beats seeing the Pacific Ocean everyday at work.  Customers hearing stories of what's been going on are upset that team members are are going to leave because of the new guy. Many have threatened to call the corporate office. Those threats made me feel nice that my work is appreciate.  Now playing:  Weezer  - The Good Life  Stiff Little Fingers is tomorrow night! Then Vegas on Sunday!  ***
