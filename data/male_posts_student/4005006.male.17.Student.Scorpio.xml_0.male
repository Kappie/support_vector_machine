I now have £150 in the bag, I'd be relatively happy not having to even bother to go into work on Monday. We'll see how long I last eh??  I've been to the pub, fan-bloody-tastic fun. We had a curry take-away. I drank a lot. I started drinking at 4.30 when I'd got off work and found a bar, I went and got mum's CD - see previous posts - and I decided to drink some more. When I got home we had fun with Mum til we decided to go out to a friend's new restaurant. More drinking, canapés and socialising. Now I'm on, let me see... 4 cocktails, 3 glasses of wine. The restaurant looks great, really nice and friendly and great food, expensive, but great.  After that, I'm gettin drunk, I'm not thinking straight, I'm definitely not walking straight. My parents take me to a PUB!! Nuts... we meet up with friends, specifically Ronnie the poof, accented, rampantly homosexual and incredibly funny... moreso, incredibly drunk. We find him drinking his favourite tipple, double-vodka cokes. Nicely, my parents give me 2. Ronnie also buys me 2. FUCK! Drunk an awful lot, having a great blast.  Surprisingly I can still think and walk enough to fool parents into thinking I'm sober. We get home, have this lovely curry. I'm still drinking...  Sensing a trend here? I drink, a LOT... Archers was the next bottle I pulled out... eventually I collapsed on my bed in my shorts.  And that was the end of me.      Rambled post... but I'm writing this at the time... Half edited, half can't be bothered... this might be more fun just left as it is... let the comments roll in...
