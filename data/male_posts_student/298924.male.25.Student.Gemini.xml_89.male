I am a full blown BlackPlanet addict....I have to have a BP fix and I couldn't think of a jankier webgroup to be addicted to....it is literally like being a crack addict....there are better forums with a more desirable group of users but once you are hooked you are hooked....it's not even as glamorous as herion....the problems with BP are too numerous to even think about addressing....yet I spend an inordanate amount of time there.....  Kel is the only source of consistancy out there....Daana's gone....Dani's still hanging around....OJ's posting as often as me....  Yep....all I read now is Kelly and the Sports Guy on ESPN.....my world view has once again narrowed....  My dad is walking and talking....  In the last two weeks I have traveled back and forth between Nashville and Atlanta too many times....by bus, by plane, by car.....one of these days I'm going to walk.....  I am now obsessed with being with an older woman (26-35)....no particular reason....I guess I was slightly influenced by this BP acquaintance (nothing good can come out of BlackPlanet....nothing.....)  I went to Chaos in Buckhead last night....interesting club....I waited for about 10 minutes to get up to an area called the "Skybar"....and what I found up there was the typical crowded club experience....you can barely move....don't think about seeing what is in front of/behind/next to/below you....only the person in front of you matters and you are only pleased if it is a phat-assed female....  I here rumors that Rapheal Saadiq and D'Angelo have done what R. Kelly and Jay Z wished they could....made a decent collabo....I'll see soon....Glenn Lewis is what I've been listening to lately outside of my usual downloads (i.e. I actually bought the CD.....eat that industry pundits)....  Got a subscription to Maxim and Entertainment Weekly....I am officially a grown up....  More nonsensical thoughts can be expected when I get back from the SNMA conference in Houston....later
