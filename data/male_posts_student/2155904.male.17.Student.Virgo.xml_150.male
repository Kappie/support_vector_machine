He thought about, for the first time all year really, staying home from school.  He knew he wasn't going to but this was one of the worst he has felt all year.  In his car after he parked in the lot at school he just leaned back and nearly fell asleep before school started.  He got to that point where he suddenly realized he was falling asleep and he knew he had to go to school.  How funny would that have been if Tyke was late to first period cuz he fell asleep in his car in the parking lot.  That would be a great story to tell.  Speaking of sleeping in the parking lot, Tyke's 1st period teacher is going to be gone all week after spring break so Tyke is trying to devise a way that he can pull a 5th period, 1st period.  Just skip.  He would like to be able to just sleep in an extra hour and then not even come to 1st period at least one day but he doesn't think he'll be able to do that.  But if he does, he could hang out with Purdy when she gets to school for 2nd period.  It would be just like 5th period but earlier in the day and colder.  Well 5th period today was like 5th periods of old.  Tyke got to skip.  He walked in with his backpack on, saw the sub, turned around, dropped his backpack off outside the door, went back in, did attendance, left.  It was great.  He walked around and talked to 2 fine blog-nameless ladies that he is seeing and talking to all the time now and then he continued his journey.  Went out to his car with Macaroon for a little but it was gameday so Macaroon decided to play it safe and go back to class after a few minutes.  Tyke waited for Purdy and they went to Physics.  Oh yeah, Tyke barely said a word until 2nd period today.  That's how sick he felt.  Pretty sick.  His throat hurts quite a bit but it is a weird feeling.  If he eats a lot it makes him feel better.  The more he swallows stuff, the better it feels.  And not that Amed-style of swallowing.  Yeah, you know what kind of swallow techniques Tyke's talking about.  Nudge nudge.  JIB lunch.  Good food and it is fun talking with Amed and Doc P about stuff.  It is a great way to spend lunchtime.  Well after school Tyke took some sleep and went to some soccer game at IHS.  It was a fun time even though the guys lost.  They got quite screwed though.  Quite.  They didn't play all that well but the refs had to be joking.  One of them was.  But really, how could they be serious?  It was a joke.  And not a funny one.  Kinda like a teacher joke.  It's supposed to be funny but it has no comic value at all.  Poor delivery is a big part.  These refs sucked.  Speaking of sucking...nope, can't transition that into going to bed without making it gay.  But Tyke just did actually.  Sort of.  Zzzzzzzz...
