All that positiveness seems to be washed away. the worst part is there is nothing you can do about it. whatever you say, whatever you do, it may help a little, but there is always a scar. Simple things became complicated, and complicated things became even more complicated. just like albert einstein, he came up with dozens of mathematical formulas and theories, but he didnt know how to tie his shoelace. the old always say, take the bull by the horns, or bite the bullet or to other sayings like, once you fall off your horse, get back up. i analysed the latter, and realised that even if you fall off your horse and get back up, you will still feel the shock and the pain when you continue riding till for a while later, till the pain subsides. I'm trying my very best to cope with the pain, and someday its going to go out of control and i'll just break down. i've tried very hard to make the relationship work, hiding the way i feel sometimes, and usually it gets better after a while. i have sacrificed time, sweat and tears. if you try walking a down the road, in a straight line, you will soon fall out of line, and the line will be crooked. If you are reading this, noone can walk a straight line alone without a line of the floor to follow. everyone needs something to follow, a guideline to trail.
