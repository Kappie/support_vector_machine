I got "The Family Guy" series on DVD for $44.  I haven't had much time to watch it though.  LCS and BB5 are going to be on tomorrow.  Last Comic Standing airs from 7-9 c/t and Big Brother is on from 8-9 c/t for anyone interested in watching them.  There's not much to say now, but I'm sure I'll be more talkative on Wednesday... the day after I see the shows!  I just got done working.  We only had 70-some people who ate at the restaurant today, so it was really slow.  The restaurant I work at usually serves at least 100-150 people daily!  Of course, it's a Monday and Mondays can be slow sometimes.  Probably because we close at 1:00 on Mondays when we normally stay open until 2:00 on other days.  It's closed all day on Tuesday.  I usually work Mondays, Wednesdays, and Sundays.  This week, I'm working Thursday too.  Well, talk to you all later.
