After DNA testing I guess we proved to the world that it was him. But this isn't the end of the war. We are far from it. We all know that we will be there for at least 3 years, if not more. We will also be there with NO ally help i.e.: Russia, Germany, France, etc. I like the ad from my previous post. If there is money for Iraq, where is the money for domestic problems and Afghanistan? Insurgents are rising in Afghanistan. Why? Because the US pulled troops for Iraq. Iraq was dumb. We need to get our priorities straight.  I just noticed a few minutes ago that the war in Iraq is now at $90 Billion +. Wow! Why can't that money be spent on say like SCHOOLS?!?!?!?
