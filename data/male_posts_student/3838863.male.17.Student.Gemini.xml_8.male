These few days abit busy with school work. Chionging all day with weichong. Had a great time shoot cards at each other. Weichong taught me how to shoot poker cards like gambit. =P  Great sense of satisfaction when we finished the MI tys together with Sarah today. Then climbed up to the roof of the library block secretly at night. lolx~ it was scary. but fun.  Photosynthesis is killing me. lolx~ But i love the stress~ muacKz~ =D  on my way to become a geek.  7am - 9pm in skool. 10pm - 11pm at home doing homework.
