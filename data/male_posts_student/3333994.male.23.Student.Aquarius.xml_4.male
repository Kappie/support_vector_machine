Being that staffing is the number one cost healthcare facilities face, motivating employees to get the most out of their services is crucial.  A current trend in healthcare is the unmotivated worker.  Whether the worker is located in medical records or collections, the pattern is the same.  Workers are less motivated than in previous years.  What could be causing this? Laziness or a lack of incentives to work hard may be causing such occurrences.  A good way to slow such behaviors is to first look at the hiring and interview process.  I believe that many times, employers are looking only at experience or level of education as the deciding factors.  This is incomplete because it does not reflect how hard a person is willing to work.  More emphasis should be placed on a person's ability to address issues on their own and the ability to find work when no tasks are mandated.  Workers in a healthcare facility need to understand that just because business may be slow or all the assigned tasks for the day are completed, work does not stop.  They are still being paid and as such should find something useful to be doing.  This could include getting ahead on the next day's workload or assisting other workers with their tasks.  It is unacceptable for workers to simply waste time or to do nothing of value.  They expect to be paid for being at work and as such should expect to work for the entire allotted time.  More emphasis should also be placed on supervisors to ensure that employees know that they are to be working when they are on the clock.  No personal phone calls or entertainment should be tolerated.  Even if the employee cannot find anything useful they should at least look like they are working.  This can have a positive effect on the other employees around them.  Also, incentives or recognition for service should be given every week/month as a motivator for hard work.  Maybe this would be a gift certificate for dinner or a movie, anything to show appreciation for hard work.  Facilities need to maximize their workers outputs to lower costs.  This can only be accomplished with a team effort.  To continue ignoring this trend will mean more wasted time and less actual improvements made to the facility.  This cannot continue.  Any responses?
