Man I wanted  urlLink that CD  soooo bad, but that wasn't to be tonight...   urlLink Chad  and I went to Fort Dodge tonight and drove around. We hit up  urlLink Target , then  urlLink Wal-Mart , looking for my CD. Realizing that neither of them had it, we decided to go to the dreaded prices of  urlLink FYE ! I found the CD for a treturous price of $18.99. I wasn't about to pay no frickin 19 bucks for a CD. Thats just insane. Instead I went to  urlLink GNC  and got some  urlLink YJ Stinger . I have now had  urlLink Pounding Punch  and  urlLink Sinful Citrus .  So instead of that, Chad and I went out to eat at  urlLink KFC . Needless to say I ate WAY TOO MUCH. But thats just me :P After taht we went to  urlLink Hy-Vee  and Chad bought a papaya, a mango, some apple juice, and some odd vegan chocolate chunk baker's cookie. Quite a combo. I ended up buying a chick-o-stick and some dried bananas.  We went back and went to  urlLink Rachel's  house. While there we shared the mango, papaya, and banana thingers. I didnt like the banana things that much, the papaya wasn't that good either. The mango was pretty dang good...but it wasnt ripe.  Nothing else too great tonight.
