The “idiot” is talking to some women, and he gives all of them an assessment of their lives based on their faces except for the most beautiful one among them.  They ask him if he thinks she is beautiful and in response he says, “ you are extraordinarily beautiful Aglaya Ivanovna.  You are so pretty, one is afraid to look at you .”  I wish I could have thought of such great words.
