I did my English Literature exam this morning, and it managed to be easier than I expected, if I'd done some revision and not gone off at wild tangents in the most inapt and frankly stupid places I might have got an A, but I'm still confident that with my safely A-graded coursework and a modestly inebriated examiner I can get a B, maybe even pushing an A. Next exam on my schedule is the laboriously titled Government and Politics, about how we're all apparently supposed to lick Mrs Thatchers arse and stuff and how she is the greatest politician since Winston Churchill. Sounds like an acid trip just minus the goodness. Actually in all seriousness I have found that thanks to Devendra Banhart's interview with a cluelessly moronic NME journo, I can trip out on all sorts of things, from the red paint on the walls of my room, to grass, trees curtains and various other things. All you have to do is look at them, in detail for a few seconds and it's like, woah, mini trip no tab required. I'm currently submerged in a textual conversation with my friend Richard, regarding Steve Vai (I fucking hate Whitesnake), cheap alcopops and racist comedians, such as the irremediably bad Jim Davidson, Bernard Manning and ilk. I hate text messages they fritter away money, not quite as seriously as a complusive gambling addiction, but it's still a slow but sure drain.In my trippy state of mind I just recalled an instance on Saturday when my lounge seemed like the nexus of a global firefly convention, which was a bit crazy, I tried innumerable times to clasp one or another between my hands with a deliciously onomatopeic squish, but to no avail. Richard tells me he spontaenously entered Focus (Middle Britain's favourite for low quality DIY) and purchased a plant, which he conveyed to his Mother. Anyway I have a ridiculously irritating urge to go and listen to the Velvet Underground now. Take care my crazed internet chums. Adieu, as the ghost in Hamlet says, Adieu, Adieu.  Mood: Trippy Music: The Bees - Wash in the Rain; Violent Femmes - Country Death Song; The Zutons - Pressure Point; The Mars Volta - Televators.
