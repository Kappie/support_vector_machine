Sure, I am a rabid conservative, but that doesn’t exactly describe Bush.  And like other conservatives, I’m willing to see our man lose if it results in a shift in GOP thinking further down the line.  But the current circumstances do not afford us the luxury of getting the Iraqi War wrong, especially for political gains.  Those that continue to try to sell Bush down the river are playing a dangerous game with the future of our country, and the world.  The NYT, like other ‘respected’ outlets of journalism are waiving their responsibility to get this right in exchange for furthering an ideology at the expense of our safety.  Here’s their latest smear job.  NYT - When Americans choose a president, their most profound consideration is whether a candidate can make the wisest possible decisions when it comes to war. In the case of George W. Bush, they will not only judge whether the invasion of Iraq was the right decision, but what our president has brought away from that experience. If there were misjudgments about the nature of Iraq's weapons programs or in the ways the administration presented that intelligence to the public, we need to know whether he recognizes them and has learned from them. Yesterday, in an interview with NBC's Tim Russert, after a week in which it became obvious to most Americans that the justifications for the war were based on flawed intelligence, Mr. Bush offered his reflections, and they were far from reassuring. The only clarity in the president's vision appears to be his own perfect sense of self-justification.  Me – ‘obvious to most Americans that the justifications for the war were based on flawed intelligence.’    It’s like arguing with a retarded child, but I have to continue to try since that retarded child is spreading gasoline around the family home.  Let’s review the justifications:  -16 UN resolutions, all violated. -Ejection of UN inspectors. -Refusal to provide proof of destruction of WMD. -Firing on Allied planes in No-Fly zones. -Saddam paying $20,000 to the family of any Palestinian who kills a Jew in a ‘martyrdom’ operation. -Seeking prohibited technologies. -Possessing missiles that exceed UN mandated range. -Blah blah blah.  Do I really need to go on?  Sure, WMD was a major part of this, since the UN resolutions had a lot to say about WMD.  Now, the same people who wanted to give the Inspectors years upon years to search for weapons while Saddam played a shell game, are now ready to conclude that there never were any weapons after eight months of searching.  And it is not hypocritical for the Bush people to want more time to search.  It was clear to all that the UN team did not have adequate freedom and access to accomplish their mission.  I certainly didn’t object to the length of time – my objection was with the obvious ineffectiveness of an inspection process where Saddam controlled access.    To conclude that the weapons were never there is ludicrous at this point.  I don’t fully understand why David Kay gave up this early, but there are probably reasons I’m unaware of at this point.  My primary point is that we can’t tell yet, and to assume that they don’t exist is highly dangerous.  We have a noted criminal, holding us all hostage to his insanity.  This criminal has executed millions, and has demonstrated a willingness to slaughter any number of people.  In addition, he is doing all that he can to convince us that he has prohibited weapons systems, broadcasting threats, toying with our verification process, and refusing to demonstrate the truth.  And now we crucify the man who took this beast down?    It’s like a police officer cornering a known murderer, and then shooting him when the murderer pretends to draw a gun.  Can anyone blame the cop if the gun isn’t really there?  Are we not better off?  Bah, back to the Times.  NYT - Right now, the questions average Americans are asking about Iraq seem much clearer than the ones Mr. Bush is willing to confront. People want to know why American intelligence was so wrong about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Mr. Bush didn't have a consistent position on this pivotal issue. At some points during his Oval Office interview, he seemed to be admitting that he had been completely wrong when he told the public just before the war started that the intelligence left "no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised." At other moments he suggested the weapons might still be hidden somewhere, or that they may have been transported to another country. At times he depicted himself as having been misled by intelligence reports. But he insisted that George Tenet, the director of central intelligence, was doing a good job and deserved to keep his job.   Me – Yes, Americans DO want to know what happened to our intelligence.  If it turns out that there aren’t weapons, then we DO need a full inquiry to find out what went wrong, and how to improve our intel in the future.  This is a separate issue from the justification of the Iraq war.  It is a preventative measure against future wars.  We need to know where the intel broke down, and we need to fix it.  Any sensible American wants those answers.  Our credibility is important, and if we go to the UN tomorrow and say Syria has a nuke and is trying to smuggle it into Tel Aviv, we need that credibility to stand up.  As it is now, thanks to the echo chamber of the media, our credibility is being used up for the wrong reasons.  Our actions in Iraq were just, no matter what.  The burden of proof was on Saddam, and he failed to deliver.  If he didn’t have the weapons, he shouldn’t have played this game.  End of story.    NYT - Average Americans are also asking themselves whether invading Iraq would have seemed like the right decision if we knew then what we know now. Mr. Bush doesn't seem willing to even take on this critical question. He repeatedly referred to Saddam Hussein as a dangerous madman, without defining the threat that even a madman, without any weapons of mass destruction, posed to the United States. At one point, his reasoning seemed to be that even if the dictator did not have the feared weapons, he could have started manufacturing them on a moment's notice. To bolster his position, he cited David Kay, the American weapons inspector, as reporting that "Saddam Hussein was dangerous with the ability to make weapons." In fact, Mr. Kay said that Iraq's weapons program seemed to have ground to a halt under the pressure of the United Nations inspections and sanctions that Mr. Bush and his staff disdained last year. Mr. Kay said Saddam Hussein retained only the basic ability to restart weapons programs if that pressure were removed.  Me – The NYT drops Kay’s line that ‘in many ways, Iraq was even MORE dangerous than we had thought.’  If the Saddam regime was starting to crumble, then Iraq would indeed by more dangerous as nefarious types moved into the vacuum.  Saddam had prohibited programs.  Kay has testified that Saddam had accumulated the knowledge and resources to construct crude weapons systems, even if he hadn’t done so yet. He had a ready made workshop, needing only a few key ingredients to complete the job.  Are we supposed to concede that this is an acceptable condition, provided we continue with sanctions?  Have you seen the list of people receiving payouts from Saddam in exchange for a continued erosion of sanctions?    I simply cannot understand the retarded child.  If someone sets up a meth lab in a preschool, yet does not actually make meth, is that okay?  The Times fails to understand the new world we live in after September 11th, and for the life of me, I cannot understand this failure.  How can you witness such evil in your own town, yet continue to be blind to the evil intents of others?  How can you construct an argument that suggests inaction is the preferred path?  NYT - At other times, the president seemed to argue that the invasion was necessary simply to demonstrate that Americans did not back down from a fight. "In my judgment, when the United States says there will be serious consequences, and if there isn't serious consequences, it creates adverse consequences," he said. Although Mr. Bush tried to portray himself as a man who exhausted every peaceful solution, the "serious consequences" were threatened in a United Nations resolution in late 2002 that Mr. Bush was forced to seek to mollify nervous allies after the decision to have a war was essentially made.  Me – Well, it is already obvious that the NYT neither seeks nor accepts ANY consequence of violation of UN sanction.  And these are the people who hold the UN to the highest regard.  16 resolutions.  How many times must you be assaulted before you react?  Do Americans want to emulate the NYT in their capacity for patience?    NYT - Mr. Bush's explanation of how he reconciled the current activities in Iraq with his 2000 campaign rejection of "nation building" was simply silly. (American troops are building a nation in Iraq, he said, but they are also "fighting a war so that they can build a nation.") And it's very hard to take seriously Mr. Bush's contention that he was not surprised by the intensity of the resistance in Iraq.   Me – Yes, Bush disparaged ‘nation building’ in 2000.  He thought it was an inappropriate use of the military when there was little threat to us.  But note the date.  2000 is earlier than 2001.  The retarded child has no sense that the world changed at some point in 2001, and those that hold beliefs that no longer apply to the current situation have a particular label – fools.  Bush changed his view in response to this new reality.  Something well beyond the capacity of the NYT editorial board.  NYT - The president was doing far more yesterday than rolling out the administration's spin for the next campaign. He was demonstrating how he is likely to think if confronted with a similar crisis in the future. The fuzziness and inconsistency of his comments suggest he is still relying on his own moral absolutism, that in a dangerous world the critical thing is to act decisively, and worry about connecting the dots later. Mr. Bush said repeatedly that he went to the United Nations seeking a diplomatic alternative to war. In fact, the United States rejected all diplomatic alternatives at the time, severely damaging relations with some of its most important and loyal allies. "I believe it is essential that when we see a threat, we deal with those threats before they become imminent," he said. "It's too late if they become imminent."  Me – Oh yes, we need to have much more ‘moral relativism’.  Yes, that is the way!  Relativism brought us the Palestinian terror bombings, the slaughter in Rwanda, the killing in Serbia, and the continued festering of Islam.  The unwillingness to take a stand and label something as ‘wrong’ is precisely what delivered us to this dangerous time in history.    ‘The fuzziness and inconsistency of his comments suggest he is still relying on his own moral absolutism, that in a dangerous world the critical thing is to act decisively, and worry about connecting the dots later.’  If we deconstruct this statement, the NYT is suggesting that the prudent thing in a dangerous world is to act indecisively, and make sure you have all of your details in order so that you will be on the correct side of academics, even if it does result in the smoking remains of New York or London?  The Times is either blind with partisan rage, unspeakably stupid, or inhumanly devoid of common sense.  NYT - Another question average Americans will be asking themselves this election year is whether the Bush administration, which wanted to invade Iraq even before Sept. 11, manipulated the intelligence reports to frighten Congress and the public into supporting the idea. The president's claim yesterday that Congress had access to exactly the same intelligence he had was inaccurate, and his comments about the new commission he has appointed to look into intelligence gathering made it clear that he has no intention of having his administration's actions included in the probe.  Me- The president’s claim was inaccurate?  It would be nice to see some evidence that this is the case.  I’m sure the Times will explain that phrase in the next sentence, or at least provide some substantiation.  Oh wait, it seems they don’t.  Need I refer you again to the page listing the cries of all those Democratic senators who begged for action against Saddam, based upon intelligence regarding weapons?  As for the president’s ‘refusal’ to testify, the Times display an ignorance of the Constitution.  The president doesn’t answer to the Congress.  He is not required to testify in such proceedings, nor should he.  There is a mechanism by which the people can express disapproval should they feel the president is criminally unaccountable – it’s called impeachment.  Should the Congress believe that the president has manufactured evidence, or pressured analysts to modify their data, they should begin impeachment immediately.  If I were Bush, I would demand an impeachment hearing immediately.  (And before you can begin chanting ‘double standard’ in the Clinton case, let me address it.  Clinton testified in a trial brought by a private citizen regarding an action committed before he was president.  Being president does not make you immune to the consequence of crime.  He was not answering to Congress.  The impeachment process began the moment Clinton violated the sworn oath by committing provable perjury.  It’s a completely different situation.)  NYT - Some of Mr. Bush's comments yesterday raise questions even more disturbing than the idea that senior administration members might have misled the nation about the intelligence on Iraq. The nation obviously needs a leader who is always alert to the threat of terrorism from abroad. But it cannot afford to have one who responds to the trauma of 9/11 by overreacting to the possibility of danger. In the coming campaign, Mr. Bush, who described himself as a "war president," is going to have to show the country that he is capable of distinguishing real threats from false alarms, and has the courage to tell the nation the truth about something as profound as war. Nothing in the interview offered much hope in that direction.  Me- Here it is, in print.  The NYT suggests that protecting our interests abroad, and striking at the heart of terror, is an ‘overreaction’ to the events of September 11th.  I am amazed, disgusted and overwhelmed.  The electoral map is just a surface reflection of vast differences between the ideological poles.    The Times isn’t serious about protecting the nation.  Those that join in tearing down our resolve are blind with their hatred, and seem perfectly willing to sacrifice our security for a short term gain in the political landscape.  I haven’t been willing to go this far, but I am now prepared to join Ann Coulter in throwing around the word ‘treason’ as an appropriate description for those that blur the truth to serve their own ends.  We need an honest inquiry on intelligence, but to warp it into a freak show where we crucify a president in the name of power is unspeakable treason.    If this succeeds in bringing down the president, then we deserve the future we inherit.
