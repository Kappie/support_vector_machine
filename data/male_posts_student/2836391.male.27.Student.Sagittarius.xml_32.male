The first one resulted in the bill being passed by only one vote. The second occasion the one vote would not have made a difference, but still the MP is being criticized by many people for not voting.  My view is that we don't pay an MP a huge salary for them not to have an opinion. If there is a vote being taken, it is their job to vote on it. The trouble in this particular case is that the person in question is a list MP, meaning people have not voted for him personally, but for the party he belongs to. He was put on his parties list to represent his particular ethnic group, and they, and others, are now saying that he is not representing them as he should. It is being suggested that he should either resign now, or remove himself from the party list at the next election. The issues currently being debated in our parliament are too important to have people sitting on the fence.
