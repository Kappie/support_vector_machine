"Invisible"  What are you doing tonight I wish I could be a fly on your wall Are you really alone Still in your dreams Why can't I bring you into my life What would it take to make you see that I'm alive  [Chorus]  If I was invisible Then I could just watch you in your room If I was invisible I'd make you mine tonight If hearts were unbreakable Then I can just tell you where I stand I would be the smartest man If I was invisible (Wait..I already am)  I saw your face in the crowd I called out your name You don't hear a sound I keep tracing your steps Each move that you make Wish I could be what goes through your mind Wish you could touch me with the colors of your life  [Chorus]  If I was invisible Then I could just watch you in your room If I was invisible I'd make you mine tonight If hearts were unbreakable Then I can just tell you where I stand I would be the smartest man If I was invisible (Wait..I already am)  I reach out But you don't even see me Even when I'm screaming Baby, you don't hear me I am nothing without you Just a shadow passing through...  [Repeat Chorus]
