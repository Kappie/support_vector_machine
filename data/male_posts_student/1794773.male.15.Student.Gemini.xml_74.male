Whoo hoo!!!  anyways i'm excited for friday but i'm sad my rachael won't be able to come.  i agree erica no boys is a good idea cause my parents won't be home so i don't want to make things look bad.  rach i think that whatever you think is right is a good decision and i bet your not sore today from stupid conditioning GRRR!!!  (Palmer is crazy i swear)   hey guys bring bandanas to my house cause i think it would be cool if we all wore them to the parade.  Good times!  See you all soon and i luv ya all
