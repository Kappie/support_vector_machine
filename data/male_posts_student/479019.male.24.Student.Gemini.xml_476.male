I think the cheap price will turn them around on it.  Hmm my Winamp has been playing Vanilla Ice and Michael Jackson. Who's more white?  I've been discussing my past with several people as of late. See June 14th for info on that. I'm really curious what really made me calm down. Was it being suspended twice? Was it Trang? Was it simply being tired? I'm quite curious about that. Maybe a little of everything?  ***
