I almost revealed my political preference there.  At any rate, I will be getting my driver's license in about six weeks. So look out for a blue-and-white 1966 VW Microbus covered with conservative and Harry Potter bumperstickers.  Which brings me to my next point: Harry Potter is the best thing that happened to this planet since Ronald Reagan. Can I get an Amen?  Ok...so...about me! Right. I have  voracious  brown hair, and  death-defying  sideburns. And a melanoma (small harmless tumor) on my lower lip. Also, my hair used to be purple.  Time for a list!   Five People who I don't know, but I wish lived in my living room:  1.Emma Watson 2. Sean Hannity 3. Anne Coulter 4. Jon Stewart 5. Gideon Yago  Did y'all know that handing cookies out at the mall is illegal?
