I know I shouldn't, but i love M  The pics i got in Rio will be gere - i'm almost sure- in 2 days, i'll post them here, i promise i'll try. And my cousin brought from Rio a cold t-shirt, from where? Guess.. From United States. AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH, i still do not believe. 3 months ago she found out that i'm "americanized" - it's a world we created here in Brazil for people who like USA, I'm soooo americanized- and she has a bf who went to USA , he has this t-shirt which one he didn't wear, whatever... She asked him this cold t-hisrt and HE gaaaaaaaaaaaave me!!!!!!! :):):):):):):):):):):) It's great, it's big, it has a huge states flag in the middle, a little big for me, but who cares, if there's the need, i'll get fatter!  I'd go to the movies, but my friend Adam, can't because he has to go to the english course, he watched it already. He's really nice and funny, and we've known each other for abotu 3 years, he's my best friend - do not worry Joe - and somedays i go to school for laughing only, like on wednesdays, on enlighs classes we laugh all the time. And we are gonna go to Chiabai - this ice cream factory that has a promotion on wednesdays. 50% half, we eat a looooooot -.  I'm so happy!!!!!! Finally, it was time for.
