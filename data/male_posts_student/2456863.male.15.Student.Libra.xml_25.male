We will live in secret cities. For here we are here. Each line is actually a (usually) modified first line of some other poem.  Line 1 - The Daffodils by William Wordsworth Line 2 - Bury Me in a Free Land by Frances Ellen Watkins Harper Line 3 - The Cities Inside Us by Alberto Rios Line 4 - The Midnight by Susan Howe
