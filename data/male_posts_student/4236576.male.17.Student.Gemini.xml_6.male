Is she ignoring me? is she mad because I stuck up for her last night? Is there someone else in her life? I just miss her sooo much and I'm worried, I feel alone here at home all by myself, nobody to talk to. Maybe I'm just paranoid or psychotic or something like that. Oh well, off to work I go, Alone, just another person in his daily routine. I talked to my Bro last night, hes doing good, I miss him even though hes still in the county, Denver is a long way away. I miss being out there, the 2 weeks I spent out there were alot of fun. We talked for a while, still figuring out stuff for the future. If hes going to be a Syracuse cop, what im going to do? What if he is a State Trooper? either way, after graduation this year, I'm going out there on a road trip to live with him for a lil bit while I get my college plans worked out. As it is, I'm looking at a University in Philly and they are real interested but the tutition is out of this world and i have to get a 1410 on my SAT to get in. It's tough but I would love to do it, My mind is set on going to a big college but with a lil help from our wonderful armed forces, my tutition sould be easily paid. Oh well, Just stressed out alot about alot of things lately. My life is too tense for the things I'm going through School, college, losing my license, and working things out with this wonderful girl I'm in love with.
