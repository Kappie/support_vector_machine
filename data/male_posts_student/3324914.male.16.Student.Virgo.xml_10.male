My other specialties include Our Lady Peace's "Clumsy," Remy Zero's "Save Me," Janes Addiction's "Three Days," Jimmy Hendrix's "All Along the Watchtower," and Boston's "More than a Feeling."  I'm good!  I've been playing alot of pinball on my computer. Its a awesome game. One day I'm going to get a real pinball machine. I used to have two arcade machines. On was about a spaceship shooting aliens (NOT space invaders, this was a side-scrolling game.) and I forget what the other one was. It was awhile ago. They were sure old machines. Yea, Arcade machines rock! Especially when they are fixed so they're always free, lol.  Well, I have to go eat. So until tomorrow.... Chao! (Is that how you spell it? lol!)
