I went this past Sunday and everyone was like youth is awesome you should come. So Amory and her mom, my english teacher, were gracious enough to give me a ride to church where I did my homework and ate dinner. Then youth, or 24.7 I believe it's called started. I can not even explain to you how cool this place was or the atmosphere or anything it was life changing I must say. So after youth everyone wanted me to stay for youth choir. I mean, people I didn't even know where asking me and I had to stay... so I did and it was awesome! At the same time, the same people wanted me play in orchestra, so I did and I was worried that I was stepping on some toes being it my first Wednesday night and all but everyone was so nice about it and I played, sight-read I should say, and it was awesome! So I made a bunch of new friends, built strong bonds with some folks I never thought I would, I'm in the youth choir which is performing Sunday! and in the orchestra playing my trumpet! 
Life is great!  God is great! and boy does He let you know it once you choose to except Him into your life. Thanks everyone but especially Amory and Mrs. Mann for everything you have done for me in my walk to becoming a better, more active Christian and finding Jesus Christ as my Saviour.
