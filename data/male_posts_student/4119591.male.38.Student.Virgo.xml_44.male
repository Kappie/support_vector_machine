(She was escorted from the building; the alleged part is that she is "everyone's" favorite vocalist.)  According to  urlLink this  open letter from Michael Moore to the owner of the Aladdin, Ronstadt dedicated the Eagles song Desperado to Moore and, presumably, to the essence of his latest documentary film. Again, allegedly, Ronstadt was escorted out of the building and "wouldn't even let her go back up to her room at your hotel!"  While I think it's certainly okay for someone to think that this was a wrong-headed thing to do and that, by acting in such a strong-armed way, the Aladdin is risking some bad publicity, nowhere do I see any violation of Ronstadt's first amendment rights as Moore claims. Let's examine that amendment, shall we?   "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."  I don't recall -- and perhaps Moore can help us here -- the number of the House and Senate bills that were passed to prevent Ms. Ronstadt from speaking her mind. What I do see here is the owner of a company making a decision about what sorts of material may be presented on his property. Now, he exercises this right at the risk of public outrage and a possible boycott, but he has violated no laws. More importantly, Ronstadt's first amendment rights were not violated because the first amendment has nothing at all to say about private employers. The limit is placed on government's power with regard to speech.  I am sympathetic to Moore's point here, but he is way off base to call this a first amendment issue. He has been way off base before and I'm sure it will happen again.
