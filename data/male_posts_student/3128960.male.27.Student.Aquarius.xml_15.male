I think the emphasis is definitely on the first characteristic.  Also, and perhaps more tellingly, it "expresses Modern Life's Incredibility."  Are we supposed to capitalize "modern", "life", and "incredibility"!?  I have to give props to "B.M." Bozeman for pointing out this delectable bit of info.
