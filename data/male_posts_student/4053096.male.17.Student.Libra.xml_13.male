Got there and helped her get some stuff organized and in the Escape. She gave me a couple pillows. One was a micro-bean pillow. That thing is cool. It's really weird, but cool. And the other is a crocheted pillow she made for me. I absolutely love it! And it makes it all the more special that she made it herself. I'm going to treasure it forever and ever... that's a long time. But yeah. She headed off. They were only half an hour behind schedule, so that's good I guess  . On the way there to Bon's house I saw a Plymouth Prowler. That's a cool car. Don't see that many of 'em. They're kinda interesting, and very unique looking.   After I got back home from Bonny's house I ate lunch, broke down, and took a nap. I was exausted. Dad fixed the baptistry from where it had overflown. Actually, it was Adam and dad. Adam needed the help, because it wasn't really a one-person job. So they did that. That night, after I got up from my really long nap we had some company over. It was Anthony and his girlfriend, Devin, Mrs. Donna, and us. It wasn't a huge group, but our house isn't really the biggest house, so groups can feel real big real fast.   After the meal, I headed out to Devin's house because he invited me over there to play D I ended up spending the night. Anthony was there. Well, duh, he's Devin's roommate. Chris Meacham came and hung out and played with us. We played until around 1:00 or so. I slept on the couch. It's actually a pretty good couch to sleep on, but I didn't sleep that well since Bonny had just left that morning, so that was weighing heavy on me.   This morning I got up around 8:00 or so to be able to get a shower in time to leave for church. It ended up that Devin took a little longer than he wanted to so I ended up leaving my stuff at his house for lack of time to put it in the car. Morning services were really different without Bonny. I missed her singing next to me, then I started to think about her and came close to breaking down in the middle of the opening song. That would have been awkward.   After church we went home to eat, although I really wanted to go out somewhere. When I ate I went back to Devin's to get my stuff I left at his house. I got there and knocked on the door; no answer. A couple minutes, knock and no answer. I did that about like, five or six times and decided then to just walk on in. Turns out that he had been sleeping. But I got my stuff and left him to his sleep. After I got home, I left with dad and Dave and played disc golf. I had a bad game as usual, but it was fun anyway.   While we were disc-golfing, Bonny called. So I called her back when I got home. I had to leave a message on her answering machine. Then she finally got ahold of me and we got to talk, although it was only for a couple minutes because there was something she had to go to. But at least we got to talk alittle: )   Church tonight was youth night. Joseph Kelly did the sermon. I led a song. Number 23: Our God He is alive. I love that song. I guess I did ok considering two different people told me I pitched it perfectly. So that was cool. Brandon made me commit to doing song leading at L2L. Maybe I'll do ok in that. Anyway. After church a small group of us went to BK to grab a bite. I was going to walk home, but Brandon made me ride with him. Oh well. I'm going to walk home one of these days. I will, I promise myself that. That's pretty much it for yesterday and today. Wow, I never knew I would ever be able to write this much. crazy.
