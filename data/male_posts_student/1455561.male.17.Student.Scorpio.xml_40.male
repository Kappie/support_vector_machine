"so i said unto the fool, if ye sow wheat what will you reap? "wheat", he replied.  If i sow barley what do i reap? "Barley", the fool replied.  So if you sow hate you will reap hate.  but the fool said "no, because in your example, wheat and barley are seeds and so obey the natural laws of physics.  Hate however is a metaphysical concept and so you cant assume that it will behave in the same manner".  Ah, but it will, i told the fool, and he saw that he was wrong and left."  "honey, im thinking of having that tattooed on my face"  anyway, enough of that.  we are going to rule the world with our new product that we invented whilst talking about the film deliverance, banjos and muhammed ali.  Forget the george foreman multi-grill, thats living in the past, stop living in the past.  The future is the george formby multi-grill with the timeless slogan "turned out nice again".  think about it, you're in a shop, there are two grills in front of you: one by some ex boxer, the other by the greatest window cleaner/banjo players in the history of window cleaning and banjo players since the great window and banjo fire of 1864.    " if you can see what i can see, when im grilling bacon"  ROCK
