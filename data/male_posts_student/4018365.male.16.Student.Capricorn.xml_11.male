I like my little layout on here, it's pretty. so I am going away with this livejournal stuff for just a bit. today, as i was walking down the street by the store the call bestbuy. i noticed how elegant the trees looked, and how i would like to be one of them to. the lady in the cd isle wasnt much help. it makes me wonder what this day and age is coming to, with the lack of basiclly everything. does everyone remember bagel bites ? i remember how good thoes tasted when i warmed them up for two minutes, and forty seconds. now that same taste that i used to adore, isnt there anymore. it's kind of like what my dad said to my sister when i was evesdropping on there conversation. he said that the lack of quality is everywhere, even in food. and i would have to agree. i feel the fan on me, it feels nice. sometimes i wish i was a piece of dust, and i could just fly away. on the freeway, there were tiny men in orange suits fighting a bush fire. i don't know why would there be so many people there, to fight a little fire, on a bush. it was quite funny. i think i saw someone almost fall from the cliff. well i must go now. i'm about to depart and go to sounds like. the cd store, to see if they have this dvd that i am eagerly searching for. my quest begins today. my plan begins tomorrow.
