Show me a great actress, and you've seen the devil. Here I stand I can do no other. God help me. Amen! No man is a hero to his valet. This is not because the hero is no hero, but because the valet is a valet. Heaven lies about us in our infancy and the world begins lying about us pretty soon afterward. The beginning of an acquaintance whether with persons or things is to get a definite outline of our ignorance. This is the test of your manhood: How much is there left in you after you have lost everything outside of yourself? I want to put a ding in the universe. Most people of action are inclined to fatalism and most of thought believe in providence. When death overtakes us all that we have is left to others all that we are we take with us. As grand and griefless as a rich man's funeral. Fortune and love favor the brave. I shall the effect of this good lesson keeps as watchman to my heart.
