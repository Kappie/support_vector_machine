I memorized the R-Formula though. YaY! Good job to me!  Hmm. Today I tried to scare Gloria again. Heh. I gave myself away because I was laughing and laughing. Heh Heh! I got a new plan tomorrow! I cannot reveal, in case Gloria reads it tomorrow! Yes! I got a devious plan!!   Okay. We are meeting CQ and WQ at CCK. We met CQ on the train. That terrible WQ idiot! Don't know how to ling huo ying bian! Don't even think analytically! Planned carefully when he arrives. But please! Like he knows the scheldule of the trains! He still dares blame the train being late somemore! HELLO! Trains don't have fixed schedules! Don't even know how to think out of the box one leh! Yesterday's comprehension taught us to set some time for emergency (that's why I find it easy. I am already doing that everytime. I know perfectly well what's the passage's saying!). He obviously did not follow its advice! Ayioh!!!! That freaking guy! He complains everyone being late leh! However, he is, most often than not, the one who is late! HAIYOH! How can he complain about others when he himself is late? Totally immoral, I tell ya! If he's doing it tomorrow, we will set off without him! He will not make it big with that kind of stuck-in-the-box mindset! Think everyone/thing is supposed to work for him, go with his wishes, want the train come then they will come. Ha! What does he think he is? 'Yoh! I am terribly pissed!  Okay. Enough about him. I did not eat a proper lunch. A dessert. Chinchow with longan. I find the one at the Woodlands Central nicer. Meow. Janet joined us. After lunch, we have to rush up to buy eraser for Gloria. Then rush down to catch buses. We were almost late.   Okay. Onto the maths paper. Sigh. Fail le la. Okay. I spent too much time on the front questions, totally neglected the last few questions. I did not do the last two ones, so 13 marks gone. For the third last, I know how to do, but I have no time! Qi shi wor! Sigh. Then the earlier questions. One or two I dunnoe. The rest I only know how to do the first part. Sigh. Fail le la!  Okay. We meowed around. Got our 'new' timetable. Nothing's changed, except they added a 0.5h of CT/Assembly between Maths and Mass PE on Tuesday. Sigh. No more break le. Tis okay la. At least all of our scheldule's intact and fine. YaY!   Okay. We got back. Well, I didn't really intensive Physics studying. Just read through the Physics notes. Heh. I even fell asleep once. Oh I meow! HeHe.   Woah! Just now we got blackout wor! The official report is that there was a disruption in the gas supply from Indonesia! O.O Anyhoo, it scared me leh. I was writing the first line (luckily wor!) when the power got cut off.   Okay. The whole house was terribly pitch-black! I can't even see! I later used my phone's light to shin. Woah lao..I need to feel my way through to make it to parents room. I opened the window and see the other blocks were pitch-black too. It's quite serene and quiet. Like very calm. No lights...the sky looked grey. Nice. Torchlights were found. I called CQ they all. O.O! Looks like everyone, except Gloria, were affected. Heh. Lucky girl!  Without the fans, I was sweating all over! All over!! So hot! I quickly went outside to chui feng. We met Edmund and Cara outside. After about 30 minutes (they were the longest 30 minutes of my life! It felt like an hour! Or more), the lights were restored. Everyone cheered! YaY! I quickly came online lor.  Heh Heh. What a night! Meow moo meow! I gotta go now. See ya next time with reports on how scaring Gloria goes! TaTa! Night blog!
