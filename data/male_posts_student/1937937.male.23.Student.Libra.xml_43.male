I blatantly lifted these photos off a local news website  urlLink [WSVN 7 News Online] .  The article says: " The objects appear to accelerate rapidly and change course suddenly. At least one crew member testified in a videotaped interview that the objects encircled the military jet at a distance of at least two miles ".   Speaking of fabulous piano players: if any of you have seen  Greg , please tell him to contact me.  I've always wondered what happened to him.  He would put his head down and just jam out some incredible jazz on my little Panasonic keyboard.  I met him one night while I was incredibly high.  My friend Qaid had called me and left a message, saying: "Whatever you do, don't smoke the weed!"  I didn't get the message until 2am, and by that point I had already smoked it, so of course I freaked.  I tried calling him back but there was no answer, so I headed over to his place (he lived right across the street).  I got there, and the door was locked.  But there was another kid in the hallway, just sort of standing there, looking dazed.  Because I was so high, I figured he might know why Qaid had called: I asked him, and he said, "I might know."  So I started pumping him for information.  "The birds, man... you've got to listen to the fucking birds."  That's really what he said.  A few minutes later, security guards came over, saying they'd received reports of a suspicious prowler.  I covered for my new friend, and told them he was just visiting me.  They looked around a bit, and the whole while, this guy is telling  them  that they need to listen to the birds.  It was great.  I was entirely fucked up myself, and they told me to look after him.  They thought  he  was stoned.  It turned out that Greg was just like that: a very interesting guy.  Brilliant, and fantastic piano player, like I said.  It was always a little tricky to figure out what was going on up there in his head -- sometimes, during conversation, he would get mad at some perceived insinuation, and he wouldn't speak again for several minutes.  But damn could he play the piano.
