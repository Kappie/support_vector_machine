Even though MacSpot isn't know to the masses yet, hopefully this will change in time. I would first like to ask all the readers of this blog if we should keep the Linux News and McAfee virus box-linky things? They seem to clutter things and add extra load time for the blog, but if you, the people who come here, want to keep them and find them useful we obviously will keep them. Just comment and let us konw what you think. Later    ConMan
