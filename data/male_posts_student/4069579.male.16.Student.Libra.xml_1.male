All of a sudden, i lost everything. I lost interest in winning.. i lost interest in studying.. i lost interest in learning.. i dont want to study anymore.. i lost my self-confidence... i lost my passion for taekwondo.. but one thing i still keep.. it's what my heart keeps that's why it still beats as of this moment.. this one thing has the power to change the world. my world that i live in. A small message from her ignites my circuits, gives me the reason to live. In spite of all the things i have been through, i know this one is so true.. i miss her but i couldn't have her. Maybe that's just how life is.. i got to accept it.     i love you
