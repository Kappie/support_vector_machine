Life here is so... bland. It's probably the same in Florida, but hey it's Florida.  It wouldn't be so bad if I didn't feel so isolated. Even though I talk to Brittney, Bobby, Becca, and Erin every single day there's so much missing as well as other people missing. So today's blog is dedicated to one of the missing peoples. I feel like I should be seeing her on a milk carton.  ...  Katie Ross. I talked to her today! Katie (R) is one of my best friends, and at one time my closest friend. Since I've moved though we rarely talk.  Katie (R) is the girl next door.  I first me Katie (R) through Bobby, and up until I moved we spoke almost every day. We have a lot in common; from our taste to music to our opinions on people. Katie is just easy to talk to. So Katie and I were great friends. Not the same way Bobby and Katie are friends because they're sister and brother like (they're not siblings though). Katie's house is directly behind Bobby's. The families are great friends on account of Bobby has two little brothers and Katie has three sisters. Each child from each family has a counterpart in the other family. In fact, this year Andrew (12?) (chuckie9225.blogspot.com) had his birthday party at Katie's house (Him and Katie's sister Kimmy are the same age). Back to the relationship. Katie and my relationship was perfect. Then I moved, and it went downhill. I'm really sad about it.    .Conclusion  And that ^ is my Katlyn Ross/Daniel Abdalla biography.  In other news I just ate dinner.
