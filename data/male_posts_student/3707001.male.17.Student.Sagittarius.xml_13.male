My first idea was MvC2 at fariview... but my friend had no $$$.  Then I wanted to run some ball... crappy weather, looked like it was gonna rain at any second.  Got back on the comp, talked to some1, we almost made plans but due to indecisiveness or busyness on their part, it fell through.  So me and my friend wit no $$ ran some sc.    *** U sc illiterate prolly dont wanna read the next few paras*** *** Those who don't care also wanna skip the next part*** I hosted a 2v2 LT, since we had diff names ppl didn't know we where friends so it was ok.   Game 1: I'm Terran (as always), friend is zerg, gainst Z LOL... first game, a few mins in... I had just set up my wall (terran is my fav race) when 3 zlots and 6 lings broke through.  Of course my wall had to let the zlots through :\ ... Like come on!!! IT'S A WALL!!! ... anyways i lifted my buildings and ran to my friend's base.  I had 2 rax and a cc.  So i brought the cc safely to my friend's base and used the rax for scout.  WOW!!!  If I ever met one... my friend is an sc GOD!!!  These 2 ppl who rushed me... couldnt beat him!!!  Like how??!!  He had no expos when i died... and he still won!! LOL... i need to practice.  All he did was mass hydra... but still...  Game 2: T My friend goes 2 gates outside main, I wall up and go tech.  My friend sends 1 zlot, then sets of 2 after... he kills all blues probes ^.^  But somehow, I am the downfall again.  After my supposed holeless wall goes up 6 lings appear... so I'm like "ok... my wall will hold" ... Suddenly they just run around the wall along the edge of the cliff -_- ... WHAT??!! I had 2 rines at the time... they died... Luckily, the lings didnt go straight for my mins so I had time to bunker up my main... a few struggling mins later...  I survive.  My friend had 1st expo, then Z oppenent then me.  LOL... P opponent had NOTHING!!! I suddenly didn't feel so bad.  Anyways, my friend makes 20 goons, i send 3 vults and Z gives up, we kill blue and another vic!!! ^.^... at least this time I survived on my own...  Game 3: T Yes... we owned.  Z went hatch then pool, but really late... my friend had 2 zlots going in before red had pool out... Z practically dies before his T ally comes to the rescue.  I was already building faster then the other T... so I dropped... 2 gols and 1 tank right on his scvs... OWNED... HEY!!! I'm getting better ^.^  Game 4: TvP This was the best game by far.  We were both terran, they were both protoss.  We both wall... lol... his wall was so simple but mine is so struggle :\ ... anyways, 3 goons almost broke through but I finally got my tank out.  Then they tried my friend... are they dumb??!!  If they cant beat my wall then they cant beat his :P Anyways, I go expo... turrets on cliff... nice...  Then we start the push.  LOL... we had like 25 tanks all over the middle of the map wit mine and turret support.  We set up outside first toss base.  He can't break through.  We send vults up... no one home.  Then we sent some more tanks up his ramp and GG.  I had comsat and scanned the other toss expo... no obs??!!  Easy vic... I dropped 1 tank, 4 gols and 4 scvs... and I immediatley started turreting the cliff.  Due to cliff advantage and no obs, he couldnt see until I had 8 turrets up and after I seiged my tank.  He tried to shuttle drop and got scared off by the turrets.  Owned ^.^  ***********************************************************************  THAT was the highlite of my day :\ ... Not that I didn't enjoy myself, it's just that I wish I coulda made better use of my day off.  I can play sc anytime (tho not always wit my friend), so I wish I went out, or ran some ball (alone or wit my Mowat friends).  **sigh**  O well... I'm back to work today... ugh... not again.
