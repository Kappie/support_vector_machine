So far I've purchased a motherboard and a soundcard for myself, and a whole system upgrade for a friend from them, and they've been totally ace on every occasion. Two thumbs up.  Try  urlLink this thing  out - I rank somewhere near Ghandi and Nelson Mandela.. and opposite to our  urlLink Nation's Leader . Good work. =D  As far as composition goes, I seem to be getting back on track - I'm writing a piece entitle  Ticks and Leeches  for 2 Flutes, Voice, String Quartet and Pianoforte. It's very,  very  loosley based on the Tool song of the same name, and so may undergo a name change before it gets finished.  Is it enough though? I'm staring down the barrel of failing composition this year thanks to this total lack of motivation and/or inspiration, and I have the ominous feeling that I'm not going to be able to get things done in time.  And again with the ladies... I have this horrible, horrible feeling that as long as a certain young lady is in my life then no other woman will be good enough.  Blinded by love? Jaded, more likely. I'm 23 and I haven't had a single serious relationship in my life. Every time an opportunity presents itself, something happens to snatch it all away. Maybe I'm going for the wrong sorts of women? Fuck knows, I've gone for a whole variety of them in my life and never gotten anywhere.  Oh well, I'll live.. I assume.
