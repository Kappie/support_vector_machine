If anything, my rant on the 1st has made people's english skills WORSE!!  A bunch of my friends have gone from talking in fairly normal english, to having every other word be U or R, talking in all fucking CAPS and the CAPITOLS become lowercase and it's SO RETARTED!!!!  Swear to god(goddess?), someone said this to me the other day:  "y r u not goin 2 tgc wif us?"  And that doesn't piss me off(even though it still does) as much as when the other person just doesn't make any fucking sense.  Guy: I don't have basic cable. Guy: I'm waiting to get dsl. Me: DSL has nothing to do with TV Guy: So my sister's friend can get us cable tv Me: wtf? Guy: Yeah you can.  If that made any kind of sense to you, you're a freakin visionary.  I'd talk about it more, but i've been having this bad virus or something awful ever since I've gotten back from boston and I fucking hate it. Every day sometimes i get sick. 2 nights ago, i couldn't move it hurt so bad.
