Although Flamer is now pure heat, Tai Wu felt at ease with it even though holding it with his bare hands. Rather, he couldn’t feel any heat radiating from it at all…he is immune to the scorching flame of Flamer. Despite having no body, the fire still burned in the same position of it’s former, tamed.  Tai Wu raised Flamer, pointing straight at Kaito, he seemed confident this time.  Kaito, “Since you requested for it…I won’t hold back.” For the third time, Kaito once again assumed the position of Sen Arashi: Dai Kai Sen. Karean looked on quietly at a safe side.  Tai Wu, “Stop jabbering…” Tai Wu didn’t move his fire blade at all, it was still pointing straight at Kaito.  Kaito began his move with his frightening speed, this speed forming into a huge vacuum. Dust flew and the flame of Flamer flickered despite having quite a distance between Tai Wu and Kaito; unknowing to Kaito, this flicker is a sign for Tai Wu. Tai Wu immediately reacted to it, dashing forward strafing a little to the right, his sword now pointing towards the left side.  Tai Wu, “Wu Jian swordsmanship: Trapping a Tiger!”  Kaito cannot stop nor notice the counter move by Tai Wu, he went straight through the blazing fire “line”, this fire was enough to slow and stun Kaito down. Tai Wu successfully avoided Kaito’s move even though suffering a little cuts due to the fast flowing air current; from there, Tai Wu began his next move. Tai Wu stopped his movement, he somersault into the air, with Flamer pointing right down at Kaito.  Tai Wu, “Wu Jian swordsmanship: Eagle’s prey!”  With that, Tai Wu dived down right at the stunned Kaito and swing Flamer right at the opportune timing. The hit connected and brought further more fire and pain to Kaito. Kaito has totally stopped now, Tai Wu as said has countered Kaito’s Sen Arashi: Dai Kai Sen.  Kaito fell to the ground and began rolling himself about, trying to extinguish the fire still burning on him, Tai Wu on the other hand landed safely from the air attack. Tai Wu surprised Karean at this counterattack, but still she seemed slightly worried for Kaito…Tai Wu noticed it.  Tai Wu, “Karean, get some water and help Kaito out.”  Kaito’s cries and moans grew louder eventually until Karean splashed a pail of water at him. Shortly, Flamer changed back to its metallic form, seemingly realized that the current situation is safe.  Karean, “Now stop! Obviously you have lost, even with your best skills you can’t win over Tai Wu!”  Unexpectedly, the dishevel Kaito did not listen; he rushed towards Tai Wu unleashing a barrage of attacks with his Katana.  Kaito, “Argh!!!!! Sen Arashi: Berserker’s Crave!” Kaito began lashing out random orders of strikes, totally leaving himself open and vulnerable. However, the attack was strong and unpredictable, Tai Wu was unable to seize any chance to deal blows to Kaito. Instead he can only shift and evade the blows done by Kaito, occasionally raising the heavy Flamer up to block the heavy and lethal blows of Kaito.  After around thirty blows, Kaito halt his continuous attack; with a last block knocking Tai Wu off him, then he leaped towards Tai Wu, his Katana raised up and ready to apply a downward slash at Tai Wu.  Kaito, “Sen Arashi: Splitting a Mountain!”  Tai Wu thought, “Damn it! This can’t go on! Wu Jian swordsmanship: Flying Dragon!”   Tai Wu pulled Flamer up with all his might, making a forceful upward blow. The two blows hit, with Tai Wu’s blade weight gaining an advantage and knocking Kaito off balance; Kaito landed badly, breaking several bones in the process. However, the impact caused Tai Wu to release his grasp on Flamer, the heavy sword spinning into the air and landing with a loud thud and a big vibration on the ground.  Tai Wu headed back for Flamer and held it firmly in his hands; he turned his head back only to see Kaito getting up again despite injuries.  Tai Wu, “This guy…impressive.”  Kaito, “I haven’t lost yet! Unless I die you won’t survive!”  Tai Wu, “…if you really say so, I’ll fulfill it.”  Karean, “Wait…Wait a minute! This is going too far! Kaito stop just let this matter rest!”  Kaito, “Sen Arashi: Senpumaru!”  Kaito now holds his Katana in front of his chest, tip pointing out.  Karean, “Kaito!!! Stop it now! Senpumaru is too dangerous for your current situation!”  Tai Wu embraced himself for the next attack by this undying opponent, judging from the strange position of Kaito he knew that it wouldn’t be simple.  Kaito then looked at Tai Wu fiercely, with a light nudge of the Katana, Kaito ran towards Tai Wu and first sliced out with a circular motion; Tai Wu easily blocked it. But then, few more heavy circular slashes crossed out, pushing Tai Wu off. To Tai Wu’s amazement, Kaito was actually turning in circles with his Katana slicing in every revolution; it resembled a spinning top with blades sticking out from its side.  Suddenly, Flamer grew into orange lights and flames again.  Tai Wu, “What the…Great timing! Wu Jian swordsmanship: Random Move!”  Tai Wu then began slashing out without concern; he stood at a fixed spot, moving Flamer with fast paced strikes. It didn’t manage to hurt the literally spinning Kaito but the heat slow him down, the slicing of Kaito however did get to made a few cuts to Tai Wu’s torso. Gradually, Kaito began spinning slower while Tai Wu’s fiery strokes went faster; the fire blade eventually formed an orange semi-sphere figure, looking similar to a large shield protecting him.  Soon, Kaito’s spinning couldn’t last; Kaito ceased the spinning looking dazed. Tai Wu seized this chance and stops his move as well. Tai Wu then placed Flamer above his right shoulder, imitating a baseball bat, in a flash, Flamer changed back to its silvery form.  Feeling the sudden change in pressure, Tai Wu made his move, “Wu Jian swordsmanship: End of Move, Last Stroke!”  Gathering all his strength, Tai Wu swing the heavy blade and smashed Kaito, making the latter fly off and crashing onto the stonewall. The blow was devastating and powerful, Kaito lay there, unconscious and in a rather deplorable sight.  Shocked, Karean rushed towards the unmoving Kaito, several footsteps beyond the door soon ensured. An uncanny feeling overcame Tai Wu; he realized he has done too much. Uncertain of the current situation and confused with this turn of events, Tai Wu ran off leaving Karean and Kaito behind…escaping into the dark tunnel with Flamer.
