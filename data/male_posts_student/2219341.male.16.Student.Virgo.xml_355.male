BURGER KING!  "so many injuries, so little time", GEOLOGICAL MASTERPIECES!  YASE!  NAME THAT BOOTY!  HEART, BUBBLE, or GHETTO?!  and the list goes on!  this years memories shirt is gonna be awesome!  anyways... im glad to be back.  Fannie and i were just sayin that we're glad to have our beds, computers, warm showers, and everything else back!  no more sleepin on hard gym floors and cold showers!  lol!  yes... this trip has really lifted my spirits.  i feel better about my current situation... though im still very strained about it.  but i guess it's ok.  we shall see.  i put up some new sites with pics from the trip.. they are great!  hahaha!  well... dunno whats next... i guess Florida this weekend for the next week... but not sure.  alright... well im gonna do somethin productive like watch a movie.  bon soir.
