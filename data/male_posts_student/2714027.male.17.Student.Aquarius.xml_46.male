I've also been looking at universities recently, and I guess that links into notebooks because I'm almost certainly going to be buying a computer when I get there. The idea of having a notebook is certainly appealing; a light and portable PC which you can carry around with you and access all your files at the same time. You can do pretty much everything you can on a desktop, but wherever you feel like doing it.  Yet there are certainly problems with this as my dad's notebook highlights. It's got the fast processor, DVD drive and the memory to suit, but it's fat, noisy, has bad battery life and heats up a little too much. Admittedly, it's cool to wirelessly surf the net on the sofa while watching TV, but when your legs start to ache/melt, or the noise of the fan gets ridiculuous, you just turn it off altogether. I don't think I could live with that if I was at university.  But there is hope though, since some laptops aren't as heavy as most of them are, plus they seem to feature much of the same technology. Intel's Centrino and Pentium M chipset things seem to feature in the lighter, better laptops. Speeds are also comparable with desktop system. Heck, the laptop my dad brough home is a tad faster than the PC I'm on now. By the time I go to uni, I expect the notebooks available will be pretty damn good to say the least.  I'll freely admit it; I'm quite a fan of gadgets. I can just see myself in late 2006 when I start university, with my laptop, PDA, iPod, digital camera and who knows what else. I won't have to come to my room to collect email on this dual-screened beige, silver and black monstrosity; I'll just pick up my email wirelessly from somewhere around the campus, maybe outside on the lawn. I guess that's part of the draw for me; having the freedom to be able to whatver I need to do IT-wise (and I'll need to do quite a bit on a Computer Science course!) outside in the open, chilling with a few friends in the sun. Notebooks release the user from the bedroom, office or study and let them play wherever. It's like being unleashed. I can't wait.
