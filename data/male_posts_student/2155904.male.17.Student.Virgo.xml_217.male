Then 2nd period he signed yearbooks with junior girl and other people.  Then came a brief stop in 3rd period where there was a little bit more yearbook signing.  But then came the Senior Assembly.  It wasn't sad this year.  There was still crying but really, it wasn't that sad.  It was still good but not sad.  A couple of bands played and they were alright.  Tank did his rendition of I Believe in a Thing Called Love which was good but Last Dance with Mary Jane wasn't spectacular.  The slide show was fine but it is cool to know that it is really a culmination of it all.  Tyke didn't have any pictures of him for a while, then he had a few, and then BOOM!  He just owned the prom portion of it.  There was like 40 pictures of him there.  One of them was the photo of Tyke slow dancing with Purdy where it looks like he is leaning in for a kiss or something.  It was funny.  Afterwards some of the girls were crying but not all that many.  But Tyke still comforted his lady friends ;-).  Smileys rule by the way.  After leaving school Tyke went to Schlotzky's with the gang.  Once again Tyke got complimented on his pink shirt, this time by the asian girl working the cash register.  She said she liked it, Tyke thanked her, then she started giggling until Tyke left to get his food.  It was cool.  If Tyke had a nickel for every time he got a compliment on his pink shirt, he'd have at least 50 cents.  That is a solid bet in the poker games so he'd take it.  Anybody wanna give him a nickel every time you comment on the shirt?  After lunch the crew went back to Tyke's to play Cranium.  Tyke and Dr. Phil dominated.  Tyke got every single Word Worm question right.  The Gnilleps and all the other spelling ones were owned by Tyke.  He excels at that kind of stuff anyway though.  Everyone left to play basketball at Amed's at 2 and that was crazy.  There were 10 people there to start and Kinker was playing and he went balls out.  He ended up cutting up Tyke with his thumb somehow.  There is a clean rip of skin from Tyke's left arm.  It looks like a hickey that drew blood.  It's Tyke (like tight but with Tyke's name).  But basketball was fun and Tyke didn't get tired.  Later on Tyke went home and ate dinner.  Then at 7 some of the gang came over and played poker.  Tyke ended up losing 10 but he played ok.  He just got rivered a couple of times.  It was fine though.  Now the night is over but tomorrow is an easy day.  Easy easy.  Bye now.
