I did some testing to learn that ISP will work and allow me to connect to the game. So I told them I'd help pay the bill to let me use it to. So now I'm playing again. However, I think I'll have to shut down my account with Skotos again. No more Castle Marrach, I just can't play two games at once. And I know I'll put more time into FFXI. I was having fun with Castle Marrach again, and I hate to just drop out again. But sometimes that's just life.
