It's one of the most unhealthy things I know... you're basically eating the fat of the pig, yum yum! But... who likes vegetables? Isn't it kind of ironic that the things we should eat, we don't like, but the things that are bad for us, we like? I heard someone say once, "Die young, leave a pretty corpse." Well, that's my random rambling... I'll probably delete it later or something...
