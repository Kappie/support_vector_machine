I really should be doing my homework, but I don't feel like it and it seems like I feel like that all the time.  I just don't feel like doing it, so I don't.  I need to wake up and smell the roses or something becuase I can't continue to be this lazy or I'll be screwed.  I'm not sure why I'm so lazy.  I've never thought much about it.  Maybe it is like the Peter Gibbins example.  It's not that I'm lazy, I just don't care.  There are a few reasons why I don't think I'm like that, one being that I do care.  The reason why I care though is so that my parents won't be on my back.  I do want to do good, but sometimes I get stressed out.  Bah, I need to do some work now.
