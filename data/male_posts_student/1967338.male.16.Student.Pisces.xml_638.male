I guess it was because Jonah just made a much more comfortable body pillow. Actually, I really don't care, because Claire is the flakiest most non-committal person I know, and I know a lot of flaky non-committal people.  Okay, moving on to happier things: I! HAVE! TiVo! I'm so happy, I'm just TiVoing everything I can. I've got the British House of Commons on there tomorrow night. I've TiVoed  The Daily Show for the last couple of days and it's been great to come home from summer school and watch Jon Stewart and some really funny people do the news.  Okay, I am tired now. This template's gotta go. Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!
