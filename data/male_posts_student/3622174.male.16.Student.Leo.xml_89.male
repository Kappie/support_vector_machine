Remember, I'm either going to make fun of the blogs seen in tonight's edition, or, I'm going to love them and say positive things in an attempt to make more people like my blog. Whichever is more important. But first, let me just say that this blog is becoming a little more popular. We've almost made our 200th hit since I put the counter up, and it was only two weeks ago. I'm impressed. Anyway, let's get to it. Here's your Late Night Bloggin' for tonight:     urlLink Memory Lane   Rating: ****    Why do I give this blog my most perfect rating of 4 stars? Simple. There's no text. There's no pictures. There aren't any annoying blog owners running around making fun of other people's blogs. In fact, all that this blog has is a template, something in her profile, and that's it. No posts, no nothing, no kidding. That's why I like this one. Normally with girl blogs (and this doesn't apply to Courtney or Jackie), they tend to start going off into the whole "Like, omg, I slept with this guy," and its really annoying, especially if you're the one who goes around looking through other people's blogs and come across it several times a day. Now, I'm almost 100% positive that this new blog, which was just created, is NOT going to stay this way. The person will probably update tomorrow or something on who she slept with recently, or something... I don't know. I don't care. But I like this blog the way it is now, and I wish it would stay this way. Congratulations, BeAuMoNt...you've won a 4 star rating. Now don't update your blog, and you'll stay off my shit list for eternity.     urlLink History of Hermione Granger   Rating:*    Well, lookslike someone's got a crush on Emma Watson, the girl who plays Hermione Granger in theHarry Potter films...his sidebar is dedicated to stats about Hermione, including birth, hobbies, and otherthings... I don't know what to say, except, I don't think I've heard of aboy whotakes a celebrity crush to this sort of magnitude. I don't thinkits a good thing. Did you know that celebrity crushes are unhealthy? Well, this is my research, because my sister recently pretty much dedicated herself to John Stamos, the dude from Full House. All she talks about is John Stamos...and ClayAiken, makingit even worse. It's more than I can handle. Good thing this kid here isn't my brother, because I hate celebrity crushes...especially when you dedicate a website to it. Sorry dude, but, get a life, quit stalking celebrities through the usage of the interweb.      urlLink Its Blog, Blog Blog!   Rating: **    First off, dude, I like your title. It's supposed to be like that Ren and Stimpy Song, which I'll post lyrics right here!:      What rolls down stairs  goes under in pairs  and over your neighbor's dog?  It's great for a snack  it fits on your back  it's log, log, log!  Its log, log  it's big, its heavy, its wood  its log, log  its better than bad, its GOOD!  Everyone wants a log  come on and get a log  everyone needs a log  log, log log  LOG, from Blamo! Thank you...thank you. Yes, I'm good with creating lyrics, aren't I. Look for my first single, "Blog, Blog, Blog," in stores on August 17th. Anywho. This blog still sucks, despite its better than bad but good title. He uses the same template that I use for Blog of Bagel (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but, his posts are kinda dumb. And that's what I don't like about most people's blogs. You have to have something a little better than "I had a dream last night," or, "Ruben's the man, I wish he'd come home." Come to me when you want advice on how to make your blog posts better!  Anyway, that's it for tonight. Tomorrow, I'll have my Nerdular Nerdance: Yearbook Camp 2003 post, which highlights the whole camp from last year, with several camp stories, and more. I'll also have the lyrics for my first single, Blog Blog Blog, tomorrow, as well. That's it for me tonight. Remember, blogging gives you a 40% chance of scoring chicks, so blog often!
