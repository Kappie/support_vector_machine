I need his Album, but have to wait an extra 19 days.  On that note! Everyone buy that album, I'll print out 100 flyers if that'd convince two people to buy it, and tell 2 more people to buy it.  It's gonna be the hottest Album of 2003 when it drops.  Seriously.  Remember the name "Sonic Jihad", the media is scared of it!
