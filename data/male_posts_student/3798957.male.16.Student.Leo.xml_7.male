Predators are totally cool. I looted some popcorn and soda that got left behind in the theater(w00t!), which you might think is gross, but I think of it as bargain hunting. What better bargain is there than free popcorn and soda, two of my favorite things? Anyway, then I went to Microplay and talked shop with a clerk and bought some Nerds Ropes. Nerds Ropes are crazy good candy, and Microplay sells them for less than the grocery chains and gas stations. Then, I caught sight of the Sobe Love Bus at a gas station and stopped to check things out. There was a cool, really nice guy with dreads, and a slightly less cool(cause he wasn't so nice) guy. I bought Sobe and I got a free shirt. I had to borrow a little bungycord to bring it home, then I came back to return the bungee and got some more Sobe. This time I chose a water bottle, but it was a really cheapo one. Then I watched a Fox special and a team of midgets raced an elephant to pull a plane. Midgets increase the awesome of any show exponentially, but there were like, 44 midgets this time. And a lot of them made faces like they had fire for blood and were constipated at the same time, so it was good. Attention TV producers! Midgets = supah cool.
