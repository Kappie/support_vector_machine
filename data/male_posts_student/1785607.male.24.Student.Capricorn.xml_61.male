When I moved to my actual room, I was working and I bought all I needed to make my shower a “pleasure shower”. I remember mom used to look me with caution and not saying anything she wished she had all I had in there. I bought scented oils, catalog body shampoo, a great shower head that gave massages with different water pressure, body brushes, candles, fluffy towels, I had everything. I used to spend more than an hour taking a bath. With time, and as I was getting busier, those long baths were getting fewer, and suddenly they stopped. But yesterday, was different. I don’t know what happened. I just stood there, hot water running down on me and me leaning on the shower wall. I spent a lot of time there and I remebered those long baths of yore ( hahaha! ). Now I recall the nice relaxed feeling, the warm embrace of water in my body, the way it feel like a soul cleansing. And it was just water and soap, nothing fancy, I was just missing some music. At the end, 45 min later, I felt so clean, so relaxed, well, relaxed is not the word I’m looking for… at peace, that’s the one. At peace.
