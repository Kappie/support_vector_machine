For a while there, i was being an asshole and talking about stuff nobody cared about, seems like after that AIM conversation I posted(I like to alienate the new readers), i was pretty much happy-go-lucky.  I guess I'll still use little amusing anec-dotes from now on, but mostly only if it'll spin off into something interesting.
