After that I went to first period, where I caught up on some much needed beauty rest.  The rest of the day went great, mainly thanks to *her*  She is so great and if not for her, this day wouldn't have been good at all.  She turns my world around :D   After school, I turned in my nomination for class president *cross fingers* I hope I win!  Well, that was my day.Until next time...
