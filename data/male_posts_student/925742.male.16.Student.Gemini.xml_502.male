Anyway, this was quite the eventful weekend.  But no matter what, it turned out great.  I beat unreal 2004.  And I spent four hours with Ashley on monday, which was aaaaawesome.    Yesterday, I didn't work.  So I played unreal.  Derek is back, too.  Last night, I cut my  thumb on a sword, and today in chemistry, I accidentally got Zinc Nitrate on the cut.  IT STUNG.... REALLY BADLY.  I worked today, and now I will do other things.
