She went to Ft.Worth and had lunch with my mom and while she was at lunch I prepared her birthday display on the table. Nothing to big, I am watching the pennies, and she knew that. I got her a dozen roses, some chocolate/vanilla fudge, and a charm braclet that she was wanting. I also bought a Royal red velvet cake and she said it was yummy. Oh, and lastly - I got her first "To My Wife" Birthday Card. :)  After all that, we went out to Grapevine Lake with James for some speed boat fun. James had bought a wake board, but no one knew how to ride it, so I had to figure it out. It took me about 5 tried to get up, but I finally figured it out. I have to say it is a lot easier than skiing and tons more fun. I dunno if the skateboarding as a kid helped out at all, but I felt totally more comfortable on the board. I'm not saying I didn't royally bust my ass, I landed on my face a few times. Alot of the time! The fun factor out weighted the pain, so it was cool. MiMi just chilled out in the boat, she seems to just enjoy getting out and doing something - I do too.  When we first got out to the lake and taxi'd out of the 'no wake' area - it started to pour rain.  I just laughed and said "Happy Birthday mimi, you gotta have an interesting memory for your 21st birthday.." The rain lasted at the most 15min - and we were sailing again.  I talked to Ed(owner of EJB Development, Inc) about my move to California - he was super cool about it and said my job was in no way in jepordy over the news. That was some relief. I needed to tell him, just because of long-term plans that were being made at work.  I also talked to the branch manager at TechSkills.com and gave him a background on my situation. He seemed to understand and is going to give me what I want. Another month to finish my CCNA and the books for the CCNP.  Things are looking up YO!   current mood:  pleased
