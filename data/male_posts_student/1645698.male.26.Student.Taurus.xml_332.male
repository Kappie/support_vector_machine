For example SD Gundam, the original Gundam series was great, but this chibbi shit is like a over medicated hobo on crack-coicane. It's so bad!!! I really hate it. why are their heads so big?? Today's suggested reading:  urlLink Anthem . The entire book can be found online. If you don't want to read it online, just take a copy from school. More stuff later, by the way I am starting up a PC mod businsess so.... let me mod your comp, or if it needs to be fixed the price is now a flat rate of $5. :)
