Mike, JD, and I had planned to get jobs this summer and next year in order to earn enough money to rent an apartment for senior year. But Country Day has something to say about that.  Apparently, a small corollary in the CCDS student contract says that if a student gets caught living in a residence without a parent or guardian, they are immediately expelled. Even if they are 18. Which confuses me. But its a rule. So grrr...  There goes the chance of the rockingest senior year ever. Oh well.  And Mike's having trouble. Hopefully he will get a scholarship to school next year. If not...well then senior year further diminishes. Mike and I didn't really like each other freshman year, but this year, we're best of friends. It'll suck if he leaves.  Third post within one evening. Heh.
