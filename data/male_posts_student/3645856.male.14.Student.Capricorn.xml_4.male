My dad brought his bike to get a new seat put on and he got some stuff adjusted on it... then I got myself a road bike with treadless tires... well, they have tread, but they're smooth. I also put a light on it for riding at night. It has a high beam and a low beam... all for a grand total of 414.00ish dollars. A little while ago I rode about a mile down to the post office off of main street and mailed a money order.. then I came home.  My pants fell down once or twice when I jumped off the bike a couple times... well.. I didn't jump off... I flew off when I locked up the brakes too quick when I was jumping this bump thing going over a hill. It was rather strange. I enjoyed it quite much. Anywho... there was this dude at the shop (he is the owner) and he said he weighed 350 pounds and he was showing us his gut and stuff... that was strange. Then I went to wendy's and got a side salad and fries. Dum de doo de dum. That's it. I'm going to find something to watch on TV.  Music - Moby - 18 album TV - It isn't on yet, but i'm going to turn it on. Mood - satisfied, happy.
