Well, almost anything. Within 1 day, a friend of mine got AIM on his computer, when everyone said it couldn't be done.  I just need a CD player. Really, REALLY badly. In half my classes we can use them.  Well, I'm off to play Savage. Great game name, right? Don't worry, COA people, I'm not a hopeless freak like AJ is when it comes to gaming. Just messin with ya, AJ :-D
