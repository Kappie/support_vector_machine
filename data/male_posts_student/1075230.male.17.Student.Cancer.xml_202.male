Eh... but seeing Bellisario in Mario outfit was worth it =P   Trish's group, and keane/renae/lynn left before the assembly... and a bunch of other people left right afer, then more after lunch. There was like... around 50 students left in the school. Me, keane and fillazola were talking about how we beat the TCDSB: we got our half-day anyway. Teachers not only turn the other way, but a lot left too.    The 4th and 5th periods were spent in the science resource area. Was going to hang around with jacky since she seemed to be the only one left... but couldn't find her, so ended up going to comm. There i found some more 11ers... but they ended leaving.. so yah. That was how i ended up in science with DYT and the rest of her 9er friends =P     Keane came back, and around that time Ross ended up having a keyboard set up, along with some music sheets for people wanting to sing carols and stuff. There was actually some pretty singing ^^   After that nice and eventful day, went home aka prison where my dad gave me another lecture/threat... ehh... i think my patience is running low... he's starting to piss me off again, it's like, u'd think i *didn't* pass all my courses last year, with good marks no less. won't waste ur time on the same stuff again ^^    Looking forward to a friggin hellish christmas stuck at home. can't go out cause of aforementioned crap and hafta work like craxy. My two main problems ever since ...ever...: parents and school. When they mix - like how it's going now - it's ... well... y'kno.    christmas is really not good time for negativity ^^ so leave off with some positive thoughts... almost happy 1 yr for keane + renae ^^ yay! d/l some Initial D songs, and found that i actually liked them ^^ yay! Today was phunn, esp. 4th and 5th, the lightest and most relaxing day i've had in a lonngg while ^^ yay!    ~Chronos    ps must be... iinnnvviiiccttuuss!!!  pps to keane: i think we were all high or something, so disregard wat u saw today =P, if something happens then yay, if not, then eh ^^;;  ppps ooopss... sorry for pushing ur post down yet again =
