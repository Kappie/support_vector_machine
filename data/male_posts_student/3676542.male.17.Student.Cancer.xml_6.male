Some  more say wat,dare to wear uniform to go out walk or not(to the class).Then what hair long like mop.Say poly nv care,then so many mop hair.INsulting pple.Later kanna beat.Say wat Cut short,go orchard then look better.Shit him.Like the staff ah,then we can don't call this 21st century.  He  got cocked eye also,my hair aint touching collar say wat will touch collar soon.Of cos lah,then wait till it touches then cut lah.WHAT ITE represent "Into The Excellence".Buzz him off ah.Since when the phrase english became so weird.Pple Usually is  "Towards Excellence".In to Excellence/Into the excellence,the phrase already sounds weird.By the way,ITE stands for Institution of Technical Education.What into excellence. -.-'  IT's THE END  still sounds better.  IT's THE END of SCHOOL LIFE..  He didnt even check those year 2.Unfair.year 2 still got long plus dyed.The staff can go bang himself into the wall.  I wanna get out of the school  As soon As POSSIBLE   singapore pledge,no no no,is the  whole world ,say wat equality. there's isn't real equality practiced here. People go poly wear home clothes,JC and ITE wear uniform. So where's the equality practices? Why is there a different in standard of teaching though people's pace of studying is different Why do country have different economic status.Why can the world world be the same? Eg,price of a drink is different at different place.Not equal.  Conclusion, HUMAN CAN NV PRACTISE REAL EQUALITY EQUALITY STILL HAVE IT'S RESTRICTION  FEELING OF TODAY: ANGRY  today morning wake up the very first feeling i got is that i missed her very much.
