Metaphorically.  I assure you. I could use the new Blogger comments but I've heard that they suck donkeys. Metaphorically. And other systems require you to splice a bit of HTML into the code of your template, which if you know sod all about HTML is a daunting task. One slip and I could ruin it forever, rather like gouging out a hamster's eye with a cocktail stick, only without all the shouting, crying and trips to the child psychologist.  I am to lazy for that so the Blogger ones are open.  Mmm, what was I talking about again?     UPDATES, UPDATES, UPDATES!  Well, I need to bring the folks up to date.  I am happy; my life is on a real upswing.  I decided to break up with Riley, I forgot to mention this.  I did love him, but to tell the truth, I saw in the beginning that this wasn’t going to work out.  I put all of my heart and emotion into the relationship, and he was well to busy being piss drunk.  I did try, but it seems that he was way to busy drowning away his own problems.  But, the upswing that I promised?  Benny Boy.  SUPRIZE! (Yall saw that coming I bet)  I look forward to an e-mail from him every morning,  Do you know what it feels like to wake up in the morning and to know that you have something from someone that cares for you?  Amazing! And to tell the truth Ben fits my pattern for a better relationship; he is 14, a youngin like Michael.  And he has the biggest heart in the world, so here is a little information on Benji… I assure you more will come later on…   ~*~*~*~*~*~BEGIN BENNY BOY”S PROFILE ~*~*~*~*~*~   Full name:  Benjamin Paul Katke, mine is Kraft, how odd …  Anagram:  Japan–like Bunkmate  Age:  5434 days old, 726 younger than me  Current cool points level:   19,473 points  Location:  Merrill, WI (Two hours north, past Stevens Point near Wausau)  Most looks like:  a younger Jake Gyllenhaal, but I think that he looks much cuter, especially with his glasses on then he is all sophisticated. *drools*  Occupation:  High school freshie   Astrological sign:  Cancer, me too!  Two individuals that devote themselves to the relationship… what is wrong here, nothing!  Likes:  Indie films, alternative music, track and field, and umm… me?  And may I add that I love indie films like “Memento,” “Donnie Darko,” “Tattered Angel,” “Rushmore,” “The Brotherhood,” and “Enough Already” to mention a lil’ bit…   Favourite cereal:  Frosted Shredded Wheat, my favourite as well! Since they no longer make my Monopoly cereal… Damn corporation   Clothing style:  Prep  Favourite store:  Hollister  Observancy level:   Supreme, example: “Ok I'm not saying this just to flatter you, this is true, I do treasure everything you write to me (if we were on the phone and I was saying this, you'd make that oh-so-adorable “Awww” sound, a sound that “ think you make better than anybody on earth, god, it's so cute, and then you'd say "unfair!" to which “ would apologize).   ~*~*~*~*~*~END BENNY BOY’S PROFILE~*~*~*~*~*    (I really, really, really and so frickin’ happy, I ain’t stopped smiling since he said, “Yes” Seriously!  OMG, he is so amazing…)        Well, guess what? Guess what?    More good news, not as good as the first but still good… I started my new job as a florist.  Odd, right?  Lol, I mean come on you know how many high schoolers that are florists, umm… none besides me!  I really think I am going enjoy it.com.  I am not standing behind some greasy grill flipping burgers and having oil splash all over me.  It ain’t typical, the women even told me she has never in 20 plus years hired anyone under the age of 18 but she thinks I have the skills and talents necessary to make it.  Wohoo! I wonder is there an organization called Young Florists of America? The YFA?  Lol, how ironic is it that some pansy boy is a florist?  I mean, lol, think, it isn’t on the top ten gay jobs list, but it is pretty up there.  Interior designer, fashion designer, shoe store worker… (Sorry Thomas I had to!), hairstylist and now: florist! Buts with this job I get both creativity and practical people skills to develop.  It is a conglomeration of many different jobs.  I am a cashier, I arrange flowers, I work on displays, and I work on presentations. I do prep work like cutting wires, stocking, plant care, and the works!  I am so excited and the pay ain’t too horrible! Peace!
