I thought today for 13 hours what to write about this trip... there are just so many amazing things that happened ont his trip that I will never be able to explain to anybody that wasn't there with me.  However, I would love to give some huge thank yous to my new friends from Alabama, as well as old friends that have become even better friends through Christ:  Leslie, Paul, Becky, Steven, Charles, Lorie, Brian, and Kevin, thanks so much for making this the best week of my life.  Tomorrow I am going to get my pictures developed and make a web site for the trip.  I'll post it tomorrow.  Songs to remember..  "Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner, sometimes I feel like my only friend, is the city I live in, the city of Angels, lonely as I am, together we cry"  "...and I said 'what about Breakfast at Tiffany's?' I said I think I remember the film, ah, yes I recall, I think we both kinda liked it, and I said 'Well, that's one thing we've got'"  "...a wimbowet a wimbowet a wimbowet a wimbowet..."  "Ice, Ice, Baby"  "And I'd give up forever to touch you, 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow, You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be, and I don't want to go home right now" - dedicated to the Alabamians.. man, I love those southerners.  Thanks guys.. it was great being able to take off the mask for a week and just be who I've always wanted to be. Thus begins the rest of my life.
