I didn't have TIME, I have to work... sometimes.  Anyways, know I'm wondering, because I wrote it like there were a lot of readers....?  I spoke to Vegard yesterday on MSN where he was about to leave China for his native Norway. There he will be working with mentally disabled children, one could find more politically incorrect term for that. These Norwegians are so healthy!!  He asked me one thing I didn't know and that I would like to know... When are you, Tim, getting married?  Last weekend I didn't do anything at all. Just played Championship Manager and watched videos. Next weekend though I'm going to a party because my friend just bought his first apartment and also a girl at work invited me to come to a party. She's two years older so there might be some hot moms at that party, think I'll go to the other one.  Good for now, just the spell check left. Ãšlli
