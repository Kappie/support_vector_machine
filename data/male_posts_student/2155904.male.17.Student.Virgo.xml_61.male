But of course his mom was being anal and made him stay home yet again.  That was kinda gay.  But he made the best of it.  Well, he at least made some good out of it.  He didn't really do anything again but it wasn't too bad today.  Maybe he is just getting used to being alone again.  That is what it was like when he lived in Preston.  He never had people over or went and did anything then.  But he never had so he wasn't bored or lonely or anything.  It was when he moved to Sammamish and started hanging out with friends everyday that he found out what he would miss out on.  And then with people beginning to date and all there was less time for Tyke.  Which is actually in some ways a good thing.  Tyke is sorta becoming more independent like he used to be.  It helps that he has primarily his own floor downstairs.  He gets to hang out and talk and stuff like that without worrying about parents being around.  And that is really nice sometimes.  But really he has run out of things that are semi-interesting.  He won't have his car tomorrow but Skippy said he can give him a ride home so that is awesome.  And who knows, there is that minute chance of no school.  Yeah, thats right...a tiny chance of yet another day staying home.  4 schools in the Issy District were without power at 5:30 according to the Issaquah School District website.  That means there is an ever so slight chance of no school on Thursday.  But Tyke certainly is not counting on that.  He has gotten all his homework done and everything so he is set to go.  The snow isn't fully gone yet either.  But it is far from being as beautiful as it is when it covers the whole area.  That is quite a sight.  Ok, this is just about to turn into rambling.  Here is something for all of you to think about: how old is the oldest 8 year old?
