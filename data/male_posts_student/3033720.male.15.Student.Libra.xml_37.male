Yeah....Dustin is shutting down his blog.....If you cant stand the heat THEN GET OUTTA THE COOKIE JAR......I will miss your inspiration, and so will many other people, including my xbox live friends who now think you are a queer for posting that.  This little extention is for you, Daniel's xbox live friends, I love you guys........  By the way, that wonderful inspiring post is gone, but you can still witness it in all its glory, just go to Daniels blog.
