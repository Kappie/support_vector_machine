I'm overly tired with the amount of people who only pay attention to "radio played" songs and bands. It is my personal opinion that some of the best bands out there are not always found on the radio or television. It is my goal to try and show the readers that talent and skill can be found outside of the corporate world. Until next time, Ghostmanon3rd
