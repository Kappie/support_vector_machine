I did some summer reading work and I also scanned a lot of pictures, so that was productive. But then I got bored and had to find something to do so I eventually went to seans. Curry of course came along, and man is she getting annoying. I need a serious break from her, and much more time with you, or I am going to go crazy. I got to see steve and sean though, so that was cool. I still have yet to see the jodi though, too busy with steve, ugh. I have nothing wrong with missing someone, I understand that completely, but they have done nothing but blown everyone else off for like 4 days now. Blah.   You know what is cool though? By the time you read this you only have one full day and a good bit of traveling and then your here. I am coming out to the airport with ur mum now instead of alex, figured it would be easier and might make some inroads. I also felt bad going with alex as his car was near full and it was just kinda awkward. Oh well.  Well I have to get up early tomorrow, so I am off to bed, early for once. Have to make up for staying up till three this morning too. Plus, the best part is I get to see you again :) Love you much, *mwah*
