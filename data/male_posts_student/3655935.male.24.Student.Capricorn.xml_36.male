So, when I'm on the phone with them, I like to joke about how I'm calling them from the  future .  Needless to say, most people respond by saying it's not the future, it's just the differences between time zones.  They are completely unphased by my clearly witty observation and application of time zones.  Still, I'm resolute on using this joke until people respond appropriately.  It's bound to happen eventually.
