I'll Take the Rain , REM  The rain came down The rain came down The rain came down on me.  The wind blew strong The summer song Fades to memory  I knew you when I loved you then The summer's young and helpless.  You laid me bare You marked me there The promises we made.  I used to think As birds take wing They sing through life so why can't we? You cling to this You claim the best If this is what you're offering I'll take the rain I'll take the rain I'll take the rain.  The nighttime creases Summer schemes And stretches out to stay. The sun shines down You came around You love easy days.  But now the sun, The winter's come. I wanted just to say That if I hold I'd hope you'd fold Open up inside, inside of me.  I used to think As birds take wing They sing through life so why can't we? You cling to this You claim the best If this is what you're offering I'll take the rain I'll take the rain I'll take the rain.  This winter song I'll sing along I've searched its still refrain I'll walk alone I've given this, take wing Celebrate the rain.  I used to think As birds take wing They sing through life so why can't we? You cling to this You claim the best If this is what you're offering I'll take the rain I'll take the rain I'll take the rain.
