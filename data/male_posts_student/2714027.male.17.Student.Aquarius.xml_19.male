Sat around in Computing trying to work out how on earth to do this stupidly complex task we've been set, then had a free period, then Statistics - officially the most boring subject in the world. The afternoon was just as exciting, with Geography and Physics, then CCF (army cadet force thingy). Forgot my bus fare, so walked a mile to a mate's house where my Dad picked me up. Apparently the cost of insurance on my car will be about Â£2000, which sucks and puts in doubt whether I'll actually be able to drive after I pass my test. Damn. Oh well, at least I've got tomorrow off work...
