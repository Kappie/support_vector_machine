OOOH!! and katy called me from standord. she met a HOTTIE. what what!? and a gay guy too. and shes like.. at one of the prettiest campuses ever. except berkley. BERKLEY BOY!! who's up for a road trip? I AM. anyway, that night i was TALKING TO LILY on the computer. lily is amy's lil sis!! shes awesome. we were talking about all the times she scared amy haha and then i was like "OKAY! I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK!" and then i like signed off and left for an hour and she LEFT!! lol. poor lily. amy was like "lily said you left her! shes like 'im never waiting that long for brandon again! after half an hour you can drop a piano on my head.'" haha. poor lily. well anyway.. uhh nathalie and i got in a fight because shes upset that i post HER LIFE on my blog. and its like, its MY BLOG i can say whatever i want. and i dont tell her secrets, though i could. i just said she went to the beach and got drunk and shit. its not like it didnt happen. im sorry you didnt want the world to know, but if you dont, then dont do that shit.  duh.  im perfectly fine admitting that i get drunk in hotel rooms and give head in the back of peoples cars and hand jobs in movie theaters. but maybe im just really open and comfortable letting it all hang out.   i can let my hair down..  so anyway, she also was pissed that i told jenica, who went out with jose, that nathalie was going out with jose. jose cheated on jenica with like 3 other girls. so i thought nathalie could use that warning. and she needed to hear it straight from jenica, i didnt want to assume things. but whatever. i still have my tin ton.  and just so you all know, i may have made it seem likee crystal is a bad person up in my may post, but she still does pretty well in school and its cute that she has a boyfriend. the guy actually wasnt a random guy, but since none of them clued me in back then, i didnt have a chance to post that. but yeah, now you know. not that anyone really reads all the way down to the bottom of the blog. most people just leave. ha.  and i also talked to jaye that night. hes really cool and i really did miss him. im sorry for calling him a bitch and shit. i was just angry. i can get that way when shit happens, but im glad we're semi-talking again.   but nathalie on the other hand, she needs to realize that:   1) she is not always right, she DOES make mistakes, we all do. its part of being a stupid human teenager.  2) jose is not just a gentleman because he acts like one. i could act straight, but im still a faggot on the inside. thats what jaye does kinda. huh?  3) jose WILL cheat on her unless she does sexual things with him. and knowing how fickle she is, she probably will do that stuff. and then he'll still cheat on her because he loves the pussy.   4) i told jenica about nathalie and jose because i wanted jenica to tell nathalie the story of jen and jose and warn her. she cried on your fucking shoulder nathalie! jaye, jack and i is a totally different story, #1 we're gay and #2 we're all really hot. so it was natural that we would cheat with each other.   5) my blog is where i post MY THOUGHTS. ryan wrote about me in his blog, but i dont care cause hes cool and that's HIS blog and he can write WHATEVER he WANTS. and i write that stuff about you because its how i can explain what a DUMBASS you've been.   6) dont act like you dont spread shit about me, cause you fucking do. you told christina I made up the crayonhead thing, but YOU did. and i think thats shitty. if you can talk smack behind my back, i can too. freak.  7) MY milkshake brings all the BOYS to the yard. yours brings all the players. and they make YOU charge.   8)everyone knew about you and christina getting drunk because she told people and you told people and gardenia told people and jenica told people so its not just ME. and if you're just reading that may thing now, that just goes to show you that no one really finishes the blog issues. i doubt you'll be able to finish this one. moron.  9) dont try to turn crystal against me. shes still my friend too, and i know what a manipulator you can be "DONT TALK TO CHRISTINA!! SHES THE TRAITOR!! SHES THE ENEMY!!" such bullshit.   and  10) if you ever need help in chemistry, im just across the table. i dont want you to fail because i didnt help you. i want you to stumble and fall on your own.  THANK YOU and goodnight.   monday was a good day. i looked like MAJOR shit from staying up all night and stuff. but it was okay, because i felt good. chem was fun, i got ROCKSTARS and PARTIED and this crazy teacher came in and was like "I WAS THE GIRL IN CHEMISTRY WHO WHEN THE TEACHER SAID TO TAKE A SNIFF I WOULD TAKE A WHIFF AND PASS OUT!! THAT WAS ME!!" it was so funny. she was cool. i really dont like jean because shes a bitch to me. but i guess she MIGHT be nice. maya is actually pretty cool. and sarah makes me laugh. A LOT. katy called during class cause i called her during her class lol. it was cool, shes lovin stanford. on and NATANIA and AMANDA are awesome chicas.  during the lab, nathalie was like "brandon, i dont get this.." and im like "thats what the teachers for.." and shes like "cant you just help me?" and im like "no" and shes all "what?" and im all "because that would require talking." but if you ever do need help i'd be happy to help ya. read 10 ^^^^ anyway, i chilled with nate. hes a cool one.  anyway, after class i called tina and haha woke her up? we taked and stuff. then my mom came (and jean was there. FUGLY) and i went home and called tina back. and we talked about "people". two specific. and then we called amy. and then we watched 'YOUR FACE OR MINE!' so funny. then we called harry because he called amy.. i dunno its confusing. haha he's like "IM HERAY!" that kid is cooler that i thought. well i never thought he wasnt cool. we talked about soquel and la alcohol. and amy went off on her yearbook. it was AWESOME.  and then we all hung up. cause of the rockstar.  bio was so much fun!! we wrote notes to everyone. haha ashton knows alex and she wants to intro us. ciarra wants to introduce me to xander and morgan. lol. so many gay cuties. but i have jack so it doesnt matter. i talked to the SKATER! (ben) and the blondie boy (tyler). it was really cool. we were all laughing and partying. all i heard from the lecture was "jon", "cocktail" and "jello" WHAT? haha and we talked about how the clock was frozen. so weird.  anyway, when i got home i called amy and i was like "i know what you did last summer." and shes like "hey brandon!" and yeah. then i hung up and got some food and i hung with people. and then i talked with tin tin and jaye a laye laye!! wooo!! and then i called amy back and lily answered like "hi gaylord." haha!! that child is so mean! and shes like "AMY. IT'S A COP FOR YOU!!" haha. anyway, amy and i talked and i looked at crystals blog (ITS FUNNY!!

BREATHE ON ME.  anyway, i chilled at home and worked on homework. and then GUESS WHO CALLED!? tina and amy. yeah. i went in my room and talked to them and ate ice cream. and then it was GO TIME! well haha. tina had to go so amy and i talked for awhile. it was really cool, i told her about all the hot upperclassmen (cause she had her sisters yearbook from two years ago) so she looked up JOE! WES! RC! ZACK! and many others.  it was cool. and then i was audi.  bio was really cool. we did this genetics inheritance lab. it started off kinda lame cause we were just doing out genetic traits and then we started doing other things and then we got to do this kitty worksheet!! it was alotta fun!! i really enjoyed it.  anyway, then we did this thing where we had to get with each other and make babies. so we did that. i got with EVAN! the cute older one. haha but then i killed him because he got two recessives and i got two heteroezygotes!!! i also got with all those pretty girls and ANDONIS!! hes such a cutie! he was all "this is gonna be akward" and im like "you know i swing that way." and we fucked and we both turned out DOMINANT! woo! anyway, after it all mrs. b was writing our data up on the board and she was like so, what were the results. and then when i thought about it, i was like "wait, the results would be inaccurate because we all had sex with people who were in different generation phases then us." and she wa slike "what?" and i was like "well.. megan could have gotten it on with sarah when it was her first time but sarah's sixth time so we would have wrong results." and then she was like "oooh.." and i was like "yeah, andonis was my twentieth bang, but i was his fourth." and every laughed and she was like "TWENTY!! you were only supposed to do six!!" and we all laughed and i was like "it was fun.." and she was all "THATS WHAT cAUSEs OVER POPULATION! BECAUSE ITS FUN!" hahaha i fell on the ground i was laughing so hard. after THAT much FUN i went home and worked on my lab report and chatted to the cuties on the net.   AiMsStar125: omg...my sister's friend's dog ate a tampon and died   haha!! anyway, then it was wednesday!  i woke up LATEr than usual so i had to RUSH RUSH. when i got to chem we had to go into this shitty little 3 foot lecture room. it was so small! but i hung out with natania and amanda so it wasnt that bad. monty was wearing his cute ES shirt and sarah looked HOT AND FIFTEEN!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY SARAH!! you're a year closer to driving, sex, alcohol. baldness, saggy boobs, children, mid-life crisiss, marriage, fiftith anniversaries, and ADULTHOOD! you rock! that's my birthday shout out.  well we eventually got to go back to our normal room. after monty blinded me by burning magnesium in a fire thing. ouch. we just reviewed for the test and natania and i went online to neiman marcus and abercrombie. it was AWESOME!! ahh. clothes. i need to go to the mall. I HAVENT BEEN TO JAMBA JUICE SINCE MAY!! wow.  anyway, then amanda and i practiced our compounds. haha shes REALLY good at it. i, on the other hand, had megan (the older one) mouth the answers to me so i sounded smart. hahaha.  we were going to leave and mr. oka was all to amamnda "high heels are lethal!" cause she was wearing them. and then i was like "did you know that women in high heels produce more pressure under their heels than an elephant?" and amamndas like "NOT UH!" so we went back to ask mr. oka and we caught natania coming out of the class and we started yelling compounds at her. "BENZENE? HYDROGEN PEROXIDE?" and shes like "ahh!! i need to study! you're hurting my head!" haha i love her!"  anyway, we were waiting for mr. oka to talk to us cause sexy nate was asking a question. then i saw jean and i thought i should give her a chance to explain her side of the story.. since i didnt even talk to her about her hating me.  so i went over and i was like "jean, why dont you like me?" and she laughed (a good laugh) and she was like "who told you that!?" and i was like "dominic. the DrOMa queen." and she was like "i dont not like you brandon, i dont know you.." and im like "well, we should get to know each otha cuz youre cool and im cool." and shes like "sounds like a plan" aww jeanie, you are so on my COOL PEOPLE list now! *HIGH FIVE!* no more fish face..  anyway, when we FINALLY got to ask mr. oka about the elephant/high heel thing he was like "well, you know how you figure that out? you take an elephant and an elephant wearing high heels and you put them on your foot and see which one hurts the most." and amanda and i laughed and then i said "but isnt it true that stilletos can put a hole in a human foot?" and hes like "i dunno, ive never seen an elephant wearing stilletos. but if i do, i hope its a girl." haha so then we were like "bye mr. oka" and we walked out. megan was laughing REALLY hard.  i walked with amanda and told her about how magolli (or whatever) broke my foot outside sullivan. SO MUCH PRESSURE!! ouch. and then we did the ion/compoud thing. "NITRATE?" "NO3-, NITRITE?" "NO2-, BENZENE" and like i was walking up the hill and she was walking on the hall-ish thing so we were 3 yards apart and then up the hill, on the road, natania walks by and shes like "OMG! YOU GUYS ARE STILLA AT IT!?" haha it was SOOOOOO CLASSIC! YOU DONT EVEN KNOW!! IT MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD!! we said bye to amamnda and told her to study and then i quizzed natania and she walked down the road and i waited at the sign for my mom. haha she got a bunch right!! and then she left. STUDY HARD EVERYONE! my mom came and picked me up after that..  anyway, when i got home i went on the computer and finished up my lab report and studied for the bio quiz. i also talked to JAYE!! im so glad we're talking now jaye, we'll be buddies even when we hate each other! i luv ya! anyway, tina called and then we called amy and then we all left and i talked to lily online. shes funnay.   jackorcan: hey budddie Budddie5: hey jack Budddie5: are you sexy? jackorca: duh. Budddie5: TINAS FISH!   after that fun it was off to another night of ben, boredom and biology. i got there a little late with ashton and ciara. WOO! we got a progress report and i totally got an A! did you expect anything less? good.  then we took the quiz and i sat by ben!! ahh so hot. seriously.. DAAMN! after it was over i was outside with ashton and these chicas from my lab class. see, on lab days we split up so that one group (INCLUDING: ashton, ciarra, tyler, ben boy, molly[or something]) goes with mrs. hoffman and the rest of us go with jill. yeah.  after the break we got to evaluate the instructors and i was kinda harsh on mrs. b (jill) but everyone laughed. and then we talked and i didnt really pay attention cause we only went through four slides instead of the normal TWENTY (million. not) and so i just wrote notes and ashton + tyler + me partied and i was writing a note to naomi and i was like "BEN IS HOT!" and he saw and looked at me and smiled. AHH SO CUTE! and evan and i got in a heated debate. and i was like "SHUT UP, YOU LOVE ME!" and he laughed and just sat there and smiled. wow wow wow. boys and biology. anyway, naomi and i left at like seven cause we didnt wanna watch the HOUR movie. i called annie and we talked about tp. and shit. PT CRUISER!! WOO! and then i left and went home.  ahh the night was nice. i studied for the chem test and talked to amy and tina. even though she never called me. biotch. just kidding.  i went to bed early. on my ONE YEAR AND ONE DAY of being OPENLY GAY! so great. this past year has been the awesomest year ever.    it's been an exciting month!! thank god it's over. now we can all just move on.  so let's recap the month:  IT'S SUMMER! i love joe. a lot. naomi and ryan ditched me for asia. kyle's coool, but his boyfriend's not. patrick gave me his number.. amy is cool. SHE'S LIKE "the BEST" amazon. nathalie bitched me out and then wanted me to help her. katy is in STANFORD. WITHOUT ME!! i better finish her letter. annie and i are SO VAIN! ronnie gets more action than drunk dominic. in the future, tina will be rich $$ RIP Jake Herfurth, Amber's dog. *HUG!* if i die before i wake, feed jake. my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard. crystal is a cutie. i totally apologize for making everyone think she was a bad person in my last blog. JACK NEVER MAKES PLANS. i think he just says he wanted to hang out with me. makes sense, cause he does the same thing with dominic. or so i hear. bio and chem arent THAT hard. dreams are the hottest forms of porn. and the number one thing of the month: jaye's talking to me again!!   QUOTE OF THE MONTH:  ClimberB9: everyone is homosexual to some extent. ClimberB9: no one goes through life without experiencing homosexual feelings to some extreme.    NOTE: i'm doing a BEST QUOTES OF THE SUMMER post at the end-ish of august. so stay cool and keep bein' funny and maybe you'll land a spot.  call me. if you're sexy. bRaNdOn
