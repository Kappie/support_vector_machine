Ate a bit.. Then reached the SIR building and it took only around half an hour to renew both my Mum's and mine.. Kinda fast.. No matter.. After that.. My Mum wanna head to my Sis's place.. And when we reached.. I pounced on my Bro's PS2 and play the games.!! Hahaha! I knew it's going to be boring there.. So I started off alone.. Then my Dad starts to work on the wiring thingy.. I don't wanna get involved.. Hahaha! And guess what?! The time we reached the house was around 12 noon.. And we got home around 9pm! How time flies!! I nearly got my hands on a new cell phone.. But the shop's already closing.. So maybe tomorrow.. I'll get the new phone by Monday man!! I miss sms-ing peoples!! Hahaha!! Anyway... Just reached home and doing nothing.. Thinking of playing my PS2 later...   Peace Out!!!!!
