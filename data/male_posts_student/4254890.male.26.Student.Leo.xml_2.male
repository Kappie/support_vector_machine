Walzer is co-editor of  urlLink Dissent  and author of  urlLink Just and Unjust Wars .  The struggle against terrorism and the advent of humanitarian intervention make Walzer an increasingly valuable source of insight into the just conduct of these actions.  In addition, all should read his  urlLink "Can There Be A Decent Left?" , critiquing of the reactions of the political left following the September 11 attacks; his " urlLink The Four Wars of Israel / Palestine " is also worthwhile.
