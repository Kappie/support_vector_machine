My mom forced us to buy him something for Father's Day, there are three things wrong with this picture, 1. hes not my fuckin dad, they arent married 2. I had to spend MY money on his two $56 shirts and 3. he didnt even say thank you for them. that is some rele fucked up shit. when we only got my REAL DAD one shirt. when MY DAD found that out, he felt like shit, and i was like, good job mom. and we are goin to oregon for a week at the end of july, its gonna be : Me, Adam, my gammy, mom, aunt carol, and aunt leslie. my grandma doesnt want dana to go, cuz she wants it to be like the old times. but my mom is throwin a fit sayin that she doesnt think its fair that he doesnt get to go. commin from the same person who went on two trips with jus dana, and is goin on a 9-day cruise w/out us, i rele think that she is being extremely selfish rite now. i just need to continue to get the smaller things off of my chest so that i can focus on this whole shitload of dana. and some ppl are helping, i would like to thank Kevin for helpin me get a lot off of my chest, and Kelsey, for being there for me, and allowing me to spill how i feel w/out worrying about you tellin anybody. THANK YOU to the both of you for helping me. i COULD NOT do this w/out you. talk to yall later.
