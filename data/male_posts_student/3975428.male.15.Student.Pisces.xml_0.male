Good (story wise)/ bad (if you had high expectations on how scary it would be) Only watch it if you like a movie with a good story, love/romance, comedy, thriller, adventure, costumes, drama,  serious talking , and skinned animals!   *  God works in mysterious ways...  last night, he got me a Double Chocolate Chip Frappuccino with blended cream from Starbucks!     * HATE: Preventable mishap/ what happens after... cleaning up the mess!!! >: (
