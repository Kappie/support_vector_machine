Gonna try to put a piece of plexiglass between the door so the cats can see each other and hiss and growl and do whatever stupid cat dominance things they feel like doing without actually touching each other.  Going to have to trim both of their nails so when I get bored and put them together and have a "Kitty Thunderdome" they won't kill each other.  Brazil is being the bully, and weighs 4 lbs more than Sam, but Sam could probably beat the living crap out of Brazil.  He just doesn't have any interest in it.  C'mon Advil, do your magic. :(
