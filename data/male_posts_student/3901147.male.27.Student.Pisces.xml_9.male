As we they were trying different things on I was watching the younger brother perferom his power ranger moves on the wall and try on all the 80's motorcylce cop glasses. The kid would put them on look in the mirror and dance around. It was quite comical to see this kid in his own world. I kept looking at the kid and laughing internally and thinking of how fun it will be when I have my own kid being dumb like this. I drew my attention from the child and started helping the mom and daughter when I felt something poking me in the ass and squeezing and then poking me in the ass again. I look to the side and see the little boy standing next to me with his hand behind me like he was putting his around around me for a hug. He just kept poking and I tried to ignore the little one. Then I busted out and laughing and said, "What do you think you are doing!?" The little boy looked at me with his brown eyes and says to me, "I'm trying to give you a wedgie in your butthole."  I lost it! I could not stop laughing. The mom just looked down in disbelief but never did anything. I love this about children; the pure chaos that runs through their hads at any moment. It was classic and I will never forget that moment in my life.
