I'd been in the hospital from 7:00 am until shortly after 10 when I finally left, after spending the day working on my patients, and spending my evening in the ER seeing new ones.  One of my new patients is interesting ... she presented a few times to the ER before for bronchitis, and first was discharged with no medications.  Then they gave her some antibiotics on a later visit.  And  now  she presents with a  bad  case of pneumonia.  So bad, in fact, that if you listen to her right lung, you can hear what's known in medicine as a "rub" where the lung rubs up against the parietal pleura during breaths (which is, by the way, very painful to the patient).   The ER overall seemed a bit quieter, however.  Usually it's a crazy sort of place, with people there for everything from motor vehicle accidents to drug overdoses to finger lacerations to drug seekers.  I think it might be because last night, around 2 am, a mentally ill man went on a rampage with an assault rifle and shot five police officers.  Three came to this particular hospital, and one died.  Although no one spoke about it during the evening I was there, it just seemed  a little quieter.  My resident entered the hospital this morning and saw the mayor of our city standing in the ER talking on his cell phone, so it was pretty obvious that  something  wasn't right from the get-go.  Not a good day, but not the worst either.  Tomorrow should be another one, since it's the night I moonlight.  Good night.
