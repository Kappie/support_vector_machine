I was messing with  the character creation system, and i realized that you could change your skin blue. Hmm...   Without further adooo, i give you my Blue Man Character!           I had them posted on www.bluemanlibrary.com... check it out- for right now it's the top news story!  I know, i know, the pictures are stretched too far, the game HAD to make them widescreen :-D
