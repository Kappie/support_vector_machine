I'm debating on when I'll start this cross country practice/exercise stuff...or even if I still want to go through with joining.  Anyway, I'm convinced that Xbox Live is the best thing ever when it comes to video games.  I've made lots of new friends, and it has actually boosted my confidence when it comes to talking to groups of people.  I also get people mad at me for my 1337 C4|\/|Pi|\|G skills ;), but it's all good.  That's all that's been happening lately for me.  I'm glad I finally got a chance to talk with a girl I like last night, but she seemed kinda upset that I kept leaving her to go play xbox live...damn, it's so hard to choose between spending time developing a relationship with someone you know and care about, or just chillin with the guys and play xbox...geez this is tough :(
