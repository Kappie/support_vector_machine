I had to find my MP3 player though, and I finally found it, and it was 11:50, but I wanted to put some songs on it, so I ran downstairs and put about 7 on and that took about 4 minutes, while my parents were in the car honking at me. Well I finally finish and run outside, we get in the car and set off for Brimfield. Well, I find out my songs didn't get copied, so I wasn't very happy. I had this hour long of driving and I didn't have anything to listen to, well I did, but just the stuff that was on my MP3 player before, so I didn't listen to it that much. But on the way there we stoped at Cubs because we wanted to bring chicken out, because you could by that and you didn't have to make it. So me and my mom went into go get some, went to tha back to the place where you get the chicken, wait in line, finally we get to the lady that takes forever, and we are already late, but she finally gets there, and goes "you'll have to talk to the chicken man." And we were like alright, so she goes back, and he doesn't come out, she stays there talking for about two minutes, and finally she comes back and says, "the chicken is going to be around 20 minutes, he has a huge order right in front of you." And well oviously we didn't have 20 minutes, and we were mad because they didn't have any stupid chicken back there stupid Cubs. But then she said there might be some around the store like in the front. So my mom goes to another place, and I run to the front of the store, and I see the last two, two 8 piece packages, we wanted 16 so that worked perfectly. So I run and get it. Then we check out and my mom gets some dessert too to take out there. And then we drive and get there. We get there, and this is out in the middle of no where on the farm. I love it out there. We get there, and then we check out Aaron, my like 8 year old cousin, new moterized scotter. I had my cousin Jay on my sholders, so I couldn't ride it. But then we went inside and ate. And then we tormented the adults like we always do to either go driving or ride the gator. And they always say no. So we just keep bringing it up like every 2 minutes so they just get so annoyed that we get to drive it. Well they didn't budge, so we just went swimming in there inground pool. And then we went back and bugged them again, well they still wouldn't give it to us, so Michael had the idea of pushing it out so they would have to give it to us. So we do, and then both of our moms come out screaming at us lol. It was pretty funny, they were all mad and we were just laughing and I didn't know who to listen to because they were both contridictin themselves lol. It was pretty great. But then after that, we took a walk, and then it was time to go. Well me and my cousins always ask them to spend the night, and we always torment them and give them all this B.S. for them to finally let them let us. It took over a half an hour of negotiating, but we finally got it. My parents were gonna have my two cousins come home with them and Nate and spend the night at my house, and me and Michael were going to spend the night at Matt's house. So we finally got them talked into it, and my parents left, and then we went swimming again. After we went swimming, we got out and got ready to go over to Elmwood to go to the fireworks there. We got in the car, and then went and picked up my little cousin Jay and my other cousin Jed. So we went to the fireworks, and let me tell you, they were horrible. I am used to the Peoria one which is huge, and then I go to this little farm town that looks like a little kid is setting them off. They had huge breaks in between like every firework, and there was no more than 3 in the sky at one time. And this is how country this was, a train right in the middle of the show, came through and it was right in the middle of where everyone was sitting, we were behind the tracks of course so we lost about 2 minutes of the whole huge 10 minutes it was on. There were little kids right near the tracks to, and the train was going really fast for intown, so that was an accident just waiting to happen. But at the end of the show it was a joke, you are like "it's over?" There was no finalle at all. It just stopped, so we got back in the car, and my littlest cousin Annie, cried the whole way home. I have never heard that much constant noise before, it was crazy. But we got home, and we wanted to sleep outside because that's just what we wanted to do. So we get blankets and take them outside, and we were gonna sleep on the trampoline, but it was wet. And then I had this really cool idea, of one person sleeing on the fort, one sleeping on the other fort with your feet on the slide which wouldn't be that bad, and there was one tent out there that someone could sleep in. But Michael just thought that was a crazy idea, so we decided on the deck. Well we lay all our stuff down and use the pads of chairs for a materous which actually was comfortable. So I talk to Michael for awhile because Matt is already asleep, and in the middle of nowhere out there its freaky to be outside in the dark. You hear noises, but your in the middle of nowhere, so its wierd. But finally after an hour, we decided to go inside, not because we were scared, but because it got so damp outside. My pillow was soaked, and it felt horrible, so me and Mike woke Matt up and headed inside. We got into bed and then just feel alseep, then we woke up, and then went down and ate breakfast. Diana, my aunt is hilarious, she speaks her mind and its funny and very true. She tells Matt off all the time and we just laugh at him and its hilarious. We ate some hunnycombs and then we had lunch which was hotdogs. And then we went swimming becuase our hair was all over the place. And then Danny took us out and tried to teach us how to drive a stick shift on his truck. They say that if someone other than your parents teach you, it's much easier, and we think it was proven true when Danny was really helpful to us, and we a little different with Matt lol. Danny is really cool though. Well Michael wasn't that bad, but he already had his permit, so he didn't have to worry about the driving part just getting the gears just right. Well I had to get the gears just right and worry about driving. It's not the easiest thing in the world. I wasn't that bad at it though, the hardest part is just getting moving at the beginging without killing or like pealing out. I finally got it though after a lot of tries and once you get it, switching gears is pretty easy. But driving them is still very hard, that's why I'm never buying one. Matt kept killing it, but he is only 14 so we understood that. But after he took us all on the truck, we got in the Jeep he built himself and tried driving that stick shift. I liked the Jeep better because the stick wasn't spring loaded and you could feel where you were going easier I thought in the gears. We all drove that, and then we stopped and my mom was there by them. Then we got in the Gator and just drove around for awhile. We kicked Matt out which was pretty funny and then just kept going, and them I went to go see something and Mike drove away so he was the only one on it. So on the whole way we were all fighting to push people off. We never got our goal accomplished though. Mike and Matt, I'm still thirsty, we have to do that next time. It always never works out lol. But then after that we just talked for a little and then I went home with my mom and we took Michael home. After that, my mom had to stop at Kohels, so we went there and I just sat in the front of the store on those chair things, and then I came home and ate some taco salada my dad made and then started on my APS project, then we let off fireworks and then I just came back inside and just listend to musis. Wow, this is really long so I won't get into what I did today. I'll just write again tonight, because I'm hungry and am going to go get some food. Oh yeah, KLT, you are a wild girl lol. I still can't believe you have did that! I thought I would do something like that before you did lol. That's hilarious. Oh and Mike and Matt, you have to tell me soon about the concert for I can go buy the tickets. Matt lets see if you win a thousand dollars lol, I don't think you are going to be able to go, but if you do get to call me. And Mike I'm guessing you will, great idea about your dad going for my dad has something to do up there too. All those bands it's going to be crazy! Alright well time for food. I'll write about today tonight. Just becasue I'm tired of writing this long entrie. See-ya!
