I've played video games since I was 7, and during those times I kept thinking about what would make a great game. So now I was determined to learn to create games. I started with the programming degree at a local community college. I figured I'd get my associates degree and head for a 4-year college. But I wasn't doing very well and I was having too much trouble grasping my core classes and wasting money withdrawing from the humanity classes. I feared for my future after running scared from my government class. My hopes dwindled with the idea that most college's game design courses were just that. A course, a single class about game design. So when I found Full Sail's advertisement, I looked into the school. Everything they teach is focused on the program. I learn programming in my course program, but it focuses towards game design. With that I seem to be understanding everything alot easier (except calculus. that's just painful). Of course it took me awhile to get things moving. I spent over a year doing other stuff and not getting myself in Full Sail. I guess it paid off in the end. They upgraded their program to a BS degree. Longer and more money to fork for tuition, but a BS is always better than an associates. So earlier this year I came to Florida and toured the place. Got a great look to it and their equipment looked top of the line. Of course I was already set on applying. Two months later I was in Florida. I packed everything I owned into a U-haul and set off. My father took a vacation to help me out considering I only own a car. His truck pulled the U-hail trailer. We unloaded my stuff at my new apartment, I signed all my remaining paperwork, and decided to stay at the resort my father was staying. A little fun before 22 months of constantly work couldn't hurt. On my birthday, May 27th, I registered at Full Sail. The next week I was mostly unpacked and starting school. My first courses were Fundimentals of Game Design and Behavioral Science. Basicly, an english class and a life studies class. GDF was fun, though I had some trouble with my group on more than one occasion. We has a group of 4 and we had to create a game idea and document everything we learned. Problem was Deborah had completely different views about games. Personally I considering myself well versed on what works and sells. She thought Doom was a RPG. A person that doesn't even know one of the most famous games doesn't have enough knowledge on the gaming world to properly create one. Easily proven when her idea was a game where you ride around andget missions tocut people's heads off......I had to oppose that idea. I created a storyline for a good Action/Adventure and we worked on it (except for the 4th member that refused listen to us and did whatever he wanted). In the end we got the highest grade, though I'm gladthe gamewas just on paper. I wouldn't want to actually create it the way we ended with it.  Well that wraps up this and finishes up my life summary story. Later readers.
