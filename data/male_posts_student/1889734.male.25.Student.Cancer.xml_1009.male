Kerry didn't seem to pick up any convention bounce whatsoever.  That's not a partisan statement.  It just is.  What does this mean?  The last time a major party convention failed to generate a bounce was 1972 McGovern convention, which resulted in a 520-17 loss for McGovern in the all important (and rightly so) Electoral College.  Now, I don't think for a moment that this election is going to be anything BUT close.  We aren't going to see a landslide either way.  But I do think this is really a significant problem for Kerry.  This was his big chance to introduce himself on his own terms, and it seems to have not had much of an impact.  I'm not making a judgment on his speech, just reacting to the polls.  Now, if Bush fails to get a bounce, then all it means is the electorate doesn't give a crap about the election this year.  Or alternate, you can try to argue that almost every single voter has already decided which way to vote, but the data doesn't support that interpretation.    It's going to be an interesting finish.
