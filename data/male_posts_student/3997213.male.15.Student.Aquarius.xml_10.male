It's not a hard job at all if you can even consider it a job. It's more like something normal. So there was nothing special today. My throat is kinda sore now and so are my ears. Yeah, my ears hurt and I don't know why. Actually, I do know why. I went in the pool earlier and never got the water out of my ears. 0_0 I made Rachel and her friend a CD today. It took a chunk out of my time but it was worth it. They were pretty excited and I enjoy seeing they're faces of surprise. (I make the real deal you know?) Plus it gives me something to do that is fun.  No injuries at gymnastics tonight. Only some red marks on my stomach from the strap belt which pinced me. My leg is bruised and hurting a lot. Hopefully, I'll be over it at the end of this week because we're going to Seaside on Monday of next week. That will be a good week but we were supposed to go with my grandparents. Now it looks like they can't make it. It won't be the same without them. The olymics are also on that week. I'll have to remember to watch them in the moTEL. You know, that word is funny when you say it like that. It sounds like Mo tell.
