Not that they are bad, it's just that I have seen this thing on T.V called kidz bop.Uuuuuuuugh! I want to destroy those children of satan. Apperantly, this is a copellation album which holds many popular songs. The twist is, kids sing the songs. This makes me sick. Songs are a form of poetry, am I right? These artists pour they're hearts and souls into the songs they write to express themselves and have they're thoughts known. But the kids of the world, for the most part, are unaware of this. To them, music is just cool sounds and " interesting " lyrics. For example, when I ask my little sister if she knows what the meaning of a song is, she says" can I hear it? ". So I put the song on and at the end of it she says ( let's say that the song is hit me baby one more time ). She says " Oh, it's about a girl that's getting hit " I know that people are allowed to have different opinions about poetry, but when you take the content of a song literally without thinking about any of the symbolism and metaphors, that is just missing the point. And I'm sure that at least half the kids on those albums ( probably more ) are just like her in taking every piece of lyrical content literally. That just makes me sick.
