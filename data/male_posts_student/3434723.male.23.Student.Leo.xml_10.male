Something interesting happened a few days ago. I was asleep and I had a dream. I dreamt that 2 guys were picking me up; one holding my leg and the other my shoulder. In order to get away I kicked the guy holding my legs. Unfortunately my leg came down with a huge force and got knocked at the foot of my bed. Now I have a bandage on my leg. So those who dream a lot... it's just a dream guys... don't take it seriously.
