EVERYONE IN HUNTSVILLE WAS OUT!  it was absolutely crazy.  i must say i've been feeling a lot better than i did a week ago.  i still miss Mal though.  i try not to think about it.  i dunno what it is.  she is one of the sweetest people on this planet...when she wants to be.  oh man...there are no words to describe how much i miss her.  i cant help it.  i mean im not depressed about it anymore.  but i guess you cant help but miss someone you love.  course i still miss Kari.  but gosh i miss Mal hugging me.  or just tellin me she loved me.  and i miss her lookin at me the way she used to.  there is nothin that can replace that.  unfortunately.  its a strange feeling im having.  like i feel so calm and relaxed cuz i know that God is there.  i know he's watchin me.  but at the same time i miss people.  i miss someone who loves me.  i dunno.  i guess i like to be able to feel a person...or hear their voice.  i dunno..guess im weird like that.  i didnt watch Nemo today.  rather sad.  didnt have time.  but thats ok.  6 days in a row...i can skip a day or 2 here and there.  hahaha!  im feeling rather lonely right now.  Marbles has abandoned me for my brother.  gosh!  after all the attention i give her this is what i get?!  my brother hardly even notices her!  its not fair!  aww well!  she's just a player cat!  well gonna go to bed.  goodnight.
