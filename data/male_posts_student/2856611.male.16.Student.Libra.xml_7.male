Not so much of a rant but meh, I think personally that this years Big Brother... isn't going to be that bad! Yeah I know, I thought It was going to suck but when you look at the characters in there you notice that there is going to be alot of stuff happening. The only thing I found very set-up about it is the personalities, each person seems to have a 'type' of personality as if their picked to have confrontations and the such. I'll explain what I mean, heres a breif description of each characters personality. Ahmed: An ex-asylum seeker who hates America and likes to think he doesn't get along with most people. He despises homosexuals. Quite quiet. Quite racist. Dan: Gay but not camp. Quite straight forward, you can tell he's gay by some of the things he says but hes not camp. He hates 'camp' gay people. Emma: The quirky, dumb-looking girl from Manchester reminds me of Big Brothers Jade from the previous, no real hates I don't believe. Jason: Entered the house in a thong, and spent alot of the time showing off but claims he doesn't 'love' himself, once agains seems to get along with everyone. Kitten: Oooo! Nasty! A political activist who hates homophobia and racism. Is gay and quite proud, stands up for herself. Made an interesting 'set-up'-ish  house entrance. Marco: The campest man alive?! Everytime someone ran into the house he jumped and screamed like a girl and shouted 'Oh MY GOD!' alot. Hates domestic estates. Michelle: The 'sexy'(?) but not stupid girl. Says that she just likes to looks 'sexy' and loves 'sex' and 'porn'. Thats great Michelle! Nadia: Not much needs to be said here apart from she used to be a man. But the housemates don't know. Shell: That sort of, girl-next-door-esque persona. Seems pretty cool actually, quite smart and has good conversations. Threatened to give a strip-tease. Stuart: HE GOT FOR A's IN HIS EXAMS! Yeah he tells that to people alot. Seems quite big-headed but he can back it up. He has had some good conversations. Vanessa: Um, not much can be said about her. She seems pretty down to earth, a good-looking gal' who likes heavy metal. Nothing wrong with it. Victor: From DA' hood bruv. Says he had a rough up-bringing but seems quite adventurous, wants to learn more about people but is quite 'Ghetto' if you will. I think It will be quite interesting to watch this one, Nadia will be funny to watch, heh. Only Marco has caught on about her being a man or... ex-man but is telling the others. Alot of confrontations seem to be set up though, Ahmed and Kitten, Marco, Dan with the whole, gay/racist thing. Dan and Marco cause Dan hates camp gay people, Shell and Marco because Marco hates domestic living, I think its Shell who lives like that but I'm not sure. I think I'm going to get really pissed off with Marco and Victor... not sure why but their too 'blah'. But yeah I think it will be interesting. Ah well. They also seem to be encouraging sexual activity, like they got 12 housemates but only 10 beds, two are double beds. And the shower is see-through with a camera in their. They have some sort of 'love-nest' if you will outside. It's really odd. Meh. Im off, I'll update later.
