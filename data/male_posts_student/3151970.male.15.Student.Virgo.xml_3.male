The typical blogger account does not come with image hosting, although you can post images by linking them from other web sites.  With this program you can do that.  All you do is add the photo into your Free Hello account.   Click on "BloggerBot" and enter your blog info.  Then you just add the pictures and click "Publish" and they appear on your blog.  You then right click on the posted picture and copy and paste the URL of the photo into the following code:  img border='0' style='border:1px solid #000000; margin:2px' src='YOUR URL'  Be sure to put the carots on either side of the code (" ")  This can also be used a way to share phots between friends and family.  It works like an IM client only for pictures, just add your friends to your list and you will be able to share any photo you want.  If you are interested in a fun way to share the photos on your computer with others or want to post images on your blog download this program.  http://www.hello.com/  Have Fun! Jesse
