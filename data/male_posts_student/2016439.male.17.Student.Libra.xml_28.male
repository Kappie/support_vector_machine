Somehow, though, I think I'll make it through.  As crazy as it sounds, I think that the whole key to the madness  is  the madness, no matter what anyone else says.  There are two things I'm sure about: death and that you can't be sure about anything...heh, I guess that cancels even death out.  I want this blog to be a reflection of my thoughts, feelings, and philosophies as they come to me.  They may be in English, Spanish, French, or Italian...whichever I'm in the mood for, I guess ;-)  LifeSeeker, Philip
