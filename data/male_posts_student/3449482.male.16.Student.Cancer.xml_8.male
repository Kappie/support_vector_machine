The first day i go, i already know tat it is somehow like a meeting camp... We discussed abt how to improve ur church and how to get into serious work in church... I really learned many things from tis camp but too bad i'm a slow-absorb and slow in thinking person so many things still need time to learn and change...   Slowly i know i don hav a "jie-na" heart, a loving heart, a caring heart  and an understanding heart for my broths and sis in Christ... I always think tat i need ppl to encourage, to talk to and to care. But its other broths and sis in Christ need it not me, i should not to be a baby christian and learn to be a gd co-worker in church...  But these all changes has to take alots of time... I really feel sorry for everyone in church especially mummy "Li Qin", i always give them trouble and always act like i very pity... On the second day of our camp, a broth suddenly can't breath properly and being send to hospital... We the youth acutally pray hard for him, i was thinking of pray for the whole nite but mummy "Li Qin" ask "wat if 2mor U don hav the energy?" She is rite, so i only prayed for 4 hrs tat day but i only sleep 1 hr...  In tis camp i really learned tat i'm not serious enough for church things lorz! So there is really many things for me to change... haha! Think back, God really gave me alots of chance for me to change lorz! Really thank's God for all the things tat he has given me.
