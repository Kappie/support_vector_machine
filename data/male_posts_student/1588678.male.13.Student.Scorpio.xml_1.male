There's a lot of comedy, which comes from Johnny Depp's character; Jack Sparrow or should I say Capitin Jack Sparrow (for those whom saw the movie already). I read on the internet that Johnny Depp based his character on Keith Richards (eyes wide open, hand gestures, stuff hanging from his hair, ect.). The one thing that pissed me off most was the lady behind us. Her cell phone rang twice. Once in the beginning of the movie, and once near the middle. I felt like turning around and yelling, "Turn your damn phone off you butt-nugget!" The only reason I didn't say that is because it was the third time I had seen the movie.  Any-hoo, you should see this movie. It's well worth the price of a ticket. For this movie, I'd give it four stars.
