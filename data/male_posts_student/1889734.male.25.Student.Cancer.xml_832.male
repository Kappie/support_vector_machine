Abu Ghraib has been off the front pages for about a week, and now here they go again, injecting it into the number one slot on their Op-Ed page.  Not like the nation is focused on something positive, like Reagan's life, or our accomplishments on D-Day, or the UN resolution yesterday bringing the world together behind the new Iraqi government, or how about that special forces raid that rescued those Italian hostages - anyone read about that?  Funny, it was only on Fox....  Back to the Abu Ghraib drumbeat.  I for one hope they keep it up.  As Dennis Miller said last night - "when the pictures first came out, I was horrified.  But then they cut off that guys head, so now I trade the pictures with my friends."
