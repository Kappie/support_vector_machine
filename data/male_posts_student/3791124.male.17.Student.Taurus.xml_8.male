Our main guitarist (Tom) can't make it, so it looks like we're just going to be messing around out there.  It all depends on how practice goes...  Well, I have to go and I hope to see some familiar faces there.  There's a few shows coming up too, but I don't know when those are either.  Don't you love how I know what the hell is going on?  Something tells me no one does.
