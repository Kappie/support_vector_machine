I hate these things so much, its scary, but then im a moody ol bastard, at the age of 16 and a quarter!   10) People who go to Tesco/sainsburys/asda  FOR THE DAY!.  its their outing for the entire week,Sad bastards.   9)Wimpy dads who use things like "time outs" to control their kids. ussually seen in sandals and a rugby shirt.   8)Burberry, no explaination for that one,   7)Children who think they can dance and sing, usually seen at karokes singing "like a prayer" or the complete works of atomic kitten.Thier parents usuaully encourage them to do so. So their a bunch of liars.   6)Wasps, what the hell do they do, they have no purpose, like the U.N or the queen.   5)The elderly, They moan about young people without any real knowlegde about us,they assume we are all looking for trouble, i'll give them respect when they fucking respect me. Plus they wait for the the paper to come out rite away, and insist on fumbling for pennys on a bus. THEY DO IT ON PURPOSE!!  well im gonna finish this later, keep the suspense goin...  later  m.c
