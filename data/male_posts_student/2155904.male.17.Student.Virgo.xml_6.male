Frederique, Tina, and Tyke had fun playing cards and talking and laughing.  Laughing is fun.  Girls like laughing.  Tyke likes making girls laugh.  Tyke likes laughing.  Tyke likes laughing with girls.  Tyke just remembered he has to read Metamorphosis this weekend.  Tyke just got a little angry.  Tyke is ok now though.  Tyke is just rambling.  Stop Tyke.  Tyke stopped.  But seriously guys...Tyke is fun.  Today Tyke had a soccer game.  Actually he didn't but he was supposed to and it was going to be his first game back from his brief absence from the team.  He was going to score goals but was not given the chance.  Oh well, tomorrow he will and he is going to have fans at his game too.  He is excited for that.  He likes fans.  Fans like him.  Tyke=fun.
