But in the end due to certain reasons, I had no choice but to watch it. L0L! Some time ago, there were some frens of mine who invited me to watch this movie too, but I said there was not a chance tt I'll watch it. L0L! I actually did in the end and they'll probably screw me if they see this account. But I'm not afraid of them, there won't be any consequences or wadsoeva. L0L! Although I must admit tt I'm kindda guilty, but let's juz hope tt they won't get pissed over it ya? Hehe.  So I woke up kindda early today and met my lower sec frens and sec 1 maths teacher, Mr Ivan Lee, at 12 noon in Cineleisure. I was kindda late as I had a hard time waking up. L0L! But I still made it in time for the movie. It was pretty tough to understand, but at least there were English subtitles to help me. Overall, it's juz an okok movie I supposed. I'm never gonna say tt a Singapore production in Chinese is wonderful, superb or great in anyway. L0L! Well, but this was the second Chinese movie I actually watched.  The movie ended at 3pm and we crossed over to The Heeren for lunch/dinner at Sakae Sushi. It was the buffet kindda style, but it cost like $16/++. Mr Ivan Lee is realli good man, he treated us for both the movie and lunch/dinner. After lunch/dinner, it was like 5:30pm if I'm not wrong. We walked around The Heeren and I bought the pouch I wanted frm 77th Street! Yay! L0L! It cost me $18, which was kindda expensive.  After walking around The Heeren, we made our way to Plaza Singapura and walked around there too. We went up to the Kopitiam for some drinks and desserts. After tt, Mr Ivan Lee took his leave as he had to return to his school tmr to clear out some stuffs. My frens and I made our way down to Clementi to play pool. We played for an hour plus and went for supper after tt at the Kopitiam nearby. We left for home at about 10pm and I managed to reach home to half an hour's time. Pretty faster than usual! L0L!  Well, the match between England and Switzerland is kicking off soon and I'm not going to miss it, so I guess I'll juz stop here. Hehe, cya all around soon! Shawno OUT! =]
