By far he is the most charming person I had ever met there. We had a short but very pleasant conversation before her mother shuffled him along.  Boy: Hi, what's your name? F:   I'm Fred. Boy: Your name is Fred? F: Yep. What's your name? Boy: I'm Kevin. F: Hi Kevin! K: Do you have any pets? F: I have some cats. K: I have a fish. He's all mine and he's nobody else's. F: Do you play with him? K: And my sister has a hamster. F: Do the hamster and the fish ever play together? K: No, they're not near each other. F: Oh, I see. K: You have pet cats. F: Does your fish have a name? K: Yes. F: ... K: Do you know what kind of hamster she has? F: No, what kind? K: It's a GERBIL. F: Ooh, neat! Mother: Okay, Kevin, follow Mommy...
