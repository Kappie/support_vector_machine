They brought me some newcastle, which of course i had to drink. 4 bottles worth.  Yesterday...punk rock brunch at the T-rock with coffee and bloody's(i have to wake up , and take care of the hangover from the night before) talking of Boots and fetishes. An aborted trip to the smitten Kitten which was closed, than studying at Bobs for like four hours or so. (I got to wear my hot new red boots) and then home where i sat on my couch, in the midst of my filth and crocheted while i watched pbs shows on nature. I am so going to end up with 40 cats and a neighborhood of children scared of me. woke up this morning two hours and twenty minutes after my alarm should have gone off, but it did not. Managed to get to class just in time. Payed my tuition, and than went to lecture, where hot guy i had a crush on last fall was all like "come sit by me" and then awkwardness and stuff. So hot though...mmmmmm tyler...mmmmm. cheers devin
