Dreams and Things  To think a thought, to dream a dream, To fill a sea, or just a stream. To dream a dream, to think a thought, To build a mountain, or just a dot. Are these gifts, are these curses, To dream and think our minds verses. What will happen in time to come, What has happened can't be undone. To dream what will be, or think what to do, Or face reality and all things true. Deep, Wide, Shallow, Narrow, All differ, but are a straight arrow. To rise up high, only to fall, Or not take that chance at all. They bring us hope as well as despair, Yet so fragile, they need love and care. To raise our spirits to the very extreme, To think a thought, to dream a dream.  Thanks!
