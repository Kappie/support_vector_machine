I actually woke up at a reasonable hour, but it felt weird to greet the day at 9:47 AM* so I went back to bed for a couple hours and woke up at the reasonable hour of 11:56 AM. My dad had woken up at like 11 or something though and was really excited about cleaning out the attic and readying the house for Andrew and 'Dita to move in around the 24th, which makes sense to do it now because if we don't, when will we do it? Anyway, he managed to get me out of bed before 12:30, but didn't help at all with the cleaning of the attic because he was busy with some kind of e-mails or something from work. I can't really blame him for not doing helping me though. I mean, his e-mails and the like are paying the bills, so whatever.  While cleaning the attic, I got to organize, count, and estimate the value of all my old macs that I've collected over the years and I now know that I have 7 ADB** keyboard, 6 ADB mice, a big box of wires, two 640x480 resolution old-school mac connector monitors, 2 monochrome monitors, 2 old-school apple 800k 3.25-inch floppy drives, 1 really old-school floppy drives (ya know, the kind where the disk actually flops around. I forgot the proper name of it), a ton of floppies of both sizes, a midi to mac serial converter, 4 scsi hard drives (3 160MB, 1 40MB), and 14 (11 functional) computers. I estimated all of this to be worth close to 750 bucks if I know how to sell it, but unfortunately, I don't know how to sell it so I'll probably get close to nothing for it. At least I had fun playing with 'em and I learned a lot from them about computer diagnostic and repair. Farewell, old mac-ies, FAREWELL! :'(  Moving on, after cleaning the attic for a bit, I went to the old Tangy iMac, let's call him OCiBubble, and did some reading outside of my required humorous and blog bookmark lists. It was surprisingly fun. Then when I read about everything that struck my interest, I saw that no one was online so I started playing guitar. I've almost mastered that hard part of Doin' The Cockroach. Go me!  Hmm, let's see... Oh, and then once I was tired of playing the same thing over and over again, I picked up the book I bought at the beginning of the sumer called "The Simpsons and Philosophy". It's a really funny and high-quality book. Then by the time I was getting tired of that (I'm a very distracted individual who has a hard time focusing on anything for longer than a couple of hours), I called the people at DHL to see if the driver had come back to the station thing with my package. I would have had it, but I slept through the dude knocking on the door this morning at the ungodly early hour of 11:20AM. Jeez, who's even up at that time of the morning?  Anyway, I called and the driver wasn't back yet so I asked my dad for a ride to Best Buy for an adapter to hook my iPod up to the home stereo here and some CD-Rs and he gave me one gladly *mutters* after making me wait for a really long while... but we'll forget about that.   GEEKY JOKE UP AHEAD   NOTE: If you go to Best Buy and don't know exactly where what you want is, make sure you walk in with a TTL (Time To Live) of more than 10 because you'll get rerouted through the store by the employees way more than you'd expect.   THE GEEKY JOKE HAS PASSED   Then when we got home from the pleasant outing, my dad got back to e-mailing and I set up the speakers and iPod and central receiver thing. It's so nice now, I can listen to all my music through the big speakers. It makes me so happy to be able to listen to music on good speakers again. I really don't think I can live without high-fidelity sound. Seriously.  Hmmm... after I made myself happy with music, I picked up the guitar again, and started playing the tune that I've been working on and made close to no progress, but it's ok because I had a good time with it and I learned what not to do when trying to write a song. It's kinda hard for me to explain, so I'll just spare myself the embarrassment by trying to share it here. Then I got sick of playing my little tune and started playing some Modest Mouse songs instead. Of course, I eventually got bored with that and picked up the phone to call DHL again and this time the box was there so I asked my dad for another ride and he granted my request, of course after much waiting. I got the directions from MapQuest, copied them down and we went on our way.  Supposedly, the place we went is in Newton, a neighboring town of Watertown, but for some reason, MapQuest said that we needed to go in a semi-circle to get to our destination through Needham. It was kind of interesting getting lost on the way there. My dad and I always get lost when we try to drive around here, but usually have a pretty easy time getting unlost because the exits are numbered, as opposed to named. The system actually makes a lot of sense once you get used to it and it starts to feel weird to have no idea where something is relative to something else because you can't use the exit as a reference point. I dunno, it's just cool, or maybe I'm just a geek. Anyway, we got lost along the way, but finally got there and I picked up my computer and hugged and kissed the box and we went back home merrily. Just a note, but I really love the highways of the northeast coast. They're surrounded by trees and greenery and keep the artificial materials to a minimum so it just looks orders of magnitude prettier than west coast freeways. Just saying...  On the way home, we stopped off at the store where I got to buy a number of unhealthy, but tasty things because they were on sale. I love sales, but my pancreas, kidneys, and liver don't (poor things). Then we got home and I started up the machine and I was glad to find that they didn't mess with the hard drive and I didn't need to copy all of my data back over. Thank you, Apple for not messing with what you didn't have to, like you sometimes have a tendency to do. After that, not a lot happened. I just made dinner for my dad and I, waited for Erik to come over so we could all meet (I really like meetings), I played some more guitar, ate some chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, wrote the post before this one, read a friend's blog based on his request, burned some Modest Mouse CDs for Erik, and now here I am writing this post.  None of my friends are online, which makes me kinda sad, but I'll survive. I've got a guitar, music, TV, math that should be done by now, and the rest of the internet to keep my busy. This modern age is so nice.  Reflection of the moment: I think I'm too smart for my own good because I know myself so well that I can trick myself into thinking that I've done something worthwhile so that I don't feel bad at the end of the days that just go by, but what's worse is that I can rewrite my memories so that what's actually happened is a very hazy blur and what I want to think actually happened is there in place of it. I think I should see a shrink or something. 6 people have told me over the past couple months so far and I think they might have a point there. We will see.  This post was longer than I estimated it to be.  That is all. -- Feanor  * According to the little Sony clock thing by my bed  ** Apple Desktop Bus
