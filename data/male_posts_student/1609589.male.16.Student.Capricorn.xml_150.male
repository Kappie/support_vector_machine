The wierdest thing is who I got it from. It was me.  Yes, I got an E-mail from, apparentally, my e-mail address, journeymantsa2000@yahoo.com.  The insane part that really confused me, it had the original spelling.  For those of you who knew me back when i had my old journeyman screenname, you'd know that it was JourneymanTSA.  And, my old e-mail was JourneymanTSA@hotmail.com  But, when I switched to yahoo, it made everything lowercase automatically and put a 2000 in front of it.  The e-mail address i got this message from was "JourneymanTSA2000@yahoo.com"  And I had thought everyone had forgotten the original spelling.  This is also freaky because it's happened once before, but I can't remember what it said.  Now, either I'm sleep-typing, or someone's playing games with me.
