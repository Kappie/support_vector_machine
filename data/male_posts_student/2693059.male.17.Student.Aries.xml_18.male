Tell me how they go on a planet that is 700 degrees hot in the day time and the go out and simply hide in the shade so they won't get burnt.  Since when does shade protect you from 700 degree weather?     -White Chicks - a few funny parts but most of it was just weird.  Everything kind of just fell apart at the end.  Somehow this movie reminded me of Ms. Congeniality.     -Spiderman 2 - bullshit most of you will like this cause your idiots.  Retarded ass drama everything, Kirsten Dunst is hideous i dont wanna have to look at her for 2 hours.  Just a 2 hour soap opera.
