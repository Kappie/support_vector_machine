I'll be glad to get this one behind us.  Hopefully, Howard "SMASH!" Dean will pull it out and cement the liklihood of being nominated.  I'd rather see him campaign all year instead of Kerry or Gephardt (the miserable failure).    I don't completely understand the power of Iowa.  Only 10-12% of registered Democrats showup for Caucus, yet the media acts as if Iowa annoints the winner.  I know history says you can't finish worse than third and still win the nomination, but if you are less than third tier anyway, you probably aren't going to win a dog catching post.  Let's be done with it.  Tomorrow night we have the State of the Union (SOU).  I know that the cynical look at the SOU as just another political speech, but it really is more meaningful than that.  It does set the tone for the coming year in terms of legislation, projects and the political battles that will consume the time until the election.  Sure, we all get tired of the incessent hand clapping, but it's worth taking a look at it.  Most of the time I'll just read the speech transcript, so I'll be sure to post that here after the fact.  The rover is moving around.  It rolled up to a rock and has taken some pictures.  We're supposed to get the first spectrometer data back today during a press conference.  I'm sure there's nothing startling yet, otherwise it would have leaked.  But it will still be interesting.    That's about it from the top of my head.  I'm sure there will be more posts later today.
