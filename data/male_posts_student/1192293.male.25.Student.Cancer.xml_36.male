Instead what I found was a veritable neocon library,  most notably a few books by Michael "Gays should get AIDS and die" Savage.  No books of a more liberal variety were to be found, I guess they didn't have room for them between all of the Chicken Soup for the Hobo's soul and Dr. Phil's most recent do-it-yourself self-loathing kit.  Both Sean Hannity's books were out, but Alan "spineless jellyfish" Colmes was apparently a little too controversial to go up in the same section as Oprah's bookhole.  Oh hey, lets not forget all 6000 volumes of the Pat Roberts rapture stroke fantasy Left Behind books.  So, until they at least carry Franken, Moore, and Carville's books, fuck Wal-Mart.  They know that there is almost no place else in the small towns they service to buy books, so they practice retail based  reprogramming.  Scum.  I'll be filling my useless crapola needs elsewhere for a while.
