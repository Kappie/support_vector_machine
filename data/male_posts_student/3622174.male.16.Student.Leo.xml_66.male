You can't see it here, but, at the top, they were working to get the crystal ball up for New Year's Eve. urlLink      urlLink    The Rockefeller Christmas Tree.  Probably the tallest freakin' Christmas tree in the whole world.   urlLink      urlLink    This is the area leading to Times Square.  I took this one from the StarDust Diner, which was one of the most unique restaurants I've ever been to. urlLink      urlLink    Radio City Music Hall...didn't get to go inside, because there was something going on, but, the outside was cool enough. urlLink      urlLink    Another view of Radio City Music Hall, all Christmas-ed up. urlLink      urlLink    The Empire State Building in all its night time glory.  Didn't get to go up because it was a 4 hour wait and it already was 8 at night, so, this is the only shot I have. urlLink     Well, there ya go.  I'll be back tonight with a new post, not sure what that'll be about yet, but, until then, you can check out bagel.tech for today's download of the day, which just happens to be Hello, and check out the other features that we have today.  Until next time, adios.
