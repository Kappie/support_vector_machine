Feminists    Cause: Womens Rights     Reason it sucks: Too many bitchy women complaining about men like their shit don't stink  2. Peta    Cause: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals    Reason it sucks: Too many bitchy people saying killing animals is wrong, but in the process of not eating meat they kill animals through grain harvesting. (special thanks to maddox at www.maddox.xmission.com)  3. Amnesty International    Cause: Human Rights    Reason it sucks: Not everyone deserves human rights.   I've got a party to go to then out to see Cat and the gang so more tomarrow.
