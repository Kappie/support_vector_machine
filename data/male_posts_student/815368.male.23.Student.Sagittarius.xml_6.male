Afterwards I traveled to UTPA to practice my VSO (Valley Symphony Orchestra) auditions.  One of my goals for this summer is to be apart of the VSO.  With the right practice and preperation, I'm sure I'll do fine in the audition.  Also, just incase I don't make it this semester, there is always next semester.  I belieive that the important this is to give it a try and gain some experence from it.
