We are all inherently flawed - this effect is magnified when individuals are examined as a group. If society is apparently more evil than good, that says a lot about the nature of an individual. Of course, there are exceptions - there are very good people, and there are very evil people. In any case, we will never achieve a perfect society until every person in the society is perfect. I don't think ANYBODY will say we are perfect now, in any sense of the word ... except perhaps 'perfectly monstrous.'
