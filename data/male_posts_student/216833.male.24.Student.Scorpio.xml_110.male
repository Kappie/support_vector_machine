Once, when I ran away from home I slept in my truck in a parking lot. The police ran a scan on my plates. I know this because mimi's dad happen to hear my name on the police scanner. They let me sleep. The night after that, I slept out in this lot in the country on piece of carpet I had in my bed for the drums to sit on. I just laid there listening to the rednecks rev their engines for fun late into the night. I had some many bugs just hanging out on my hear, male mesquitos i think, because they would buzz in and sit right on my ear. I would swap but they just came right back. I wonder why.  Anyways, today I am beat. I wish I would have stayed at the show - but I think I just might be even more tired. FFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCK! How can you sleep at night with that shit!   FUCK AUGUST! I seriously hate this month and everything it stands for - SUMMER!
