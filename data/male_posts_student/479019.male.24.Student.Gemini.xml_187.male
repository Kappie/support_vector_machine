I'll check out Frys tomorrow after work.  I'll be honest with myself. Everytime I go to that shopping center in Mission Viejo / Laguna Hills with Best Buy and CompUSA, I'm reminded of the time I dated a certain someone. Driving up the 5 around the Broadway exit reminds me of another certain someone. Hell driving up the 605, or things around UCI, or whatever brings back some good and bad memories. Normally it wouldn't really bother me, but right around now it does. I want to tie up loose ends before I leave. Like I asked Julia today... ever wonder what if you and a certain someone just remained friends. What if emotions ever got out of control? For the most part all lose ends are tied, except for maybe with one person. She's the only person who's ever really offended and infuriated me. She's the only person who's really pushed me to the limits of who I think I am. Because the last words said were via email, I feel like I was a coward. I feel like I should have said what I said in person, so that I might have felt a shred of guilt, unlike I do now. I don't know... it's a complicated situation.  **
