Tell one thing that happened to you in that year (if you grab a coin with a year before you were born find another one :) ).   1992...hrm. I think I've killed off the braincells that can remember that far back. Doing the maths, that would have made me 10/11. I don't think I did a whole lot back then, certainly nothing I can particularly remember from that year... Now 1993 I started high school!   What comes to mind first when you hear the word "reality"? Why?  Reality TV. But that's cos there's so much of it on TV these days and it's mostly a pile pile of pants :(   What is the most honest thing you have done?  Are there different values of honest? Being honest is just being honest, and I try to be as much as possible, even if it means saying that yes your arse does look fat in that!   What do you like to do most with a free hour? Why?  If it's a spare hour off of doing something hectic then I'd probably snooze. I like sleep. Sometimes it's even better than sex! However I've had too many spare hours the past year so I tend to fill them with anything going.   If you could smash one thing and one thing only, what would you smash? Why?  Well last week I was all for throwing Ginge's computer out the window...but only so I could have mine online instead. Now we have them networked I don't have to. Yey. Other than that I can't really think of anything right now... No PMS needing venting ;)   For what do you think you would be willing to lay down your life? Why?  I'm rather selfish and scared of death so I can't really imagine me beign all heroic. But if I really, really loved someone... you never know until it happens.   What one word would you put on your gravestone? Why?  BLONDE - sums me up really!   What TV advertisement bothers you the most? Why?  Those stupid Esure adverts with Michael Winner...nuff said!   What was your first job?  I waitressed in a smokery coffee shop...which has given me a taste for expensive smoked things, dammit. We got free lunches and got to take home leftovers (including yummy cakes and smoked salmon).   Finish the sentence: “I have never…”  ...left Europe. I am trying to, and hopefully next year I will have saved some money for a North American tour! So watch out!
