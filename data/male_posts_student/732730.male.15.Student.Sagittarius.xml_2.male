We all had bacon and egg toasted sandwiches. They were eaten looking out over the ocean. It was quite cold.   We drove around for a while, with no particular purpose. We were on time to my appointment, but we had to wait around for an hour and a half. We went in and I said there were no problems. He checked my back, said I was inflexible and 5 minutes later we left.  "To the Gold Coast" I yelled. Well, I would've yelled that if I wasn't so tired. We drove down the M1 in peak hour traffic. Can you think of anything more fun to do after being up since 4am? We obviously couldn't. On the way down, we drove past Kieran's school. I didn't see him. That could have been because it was 5:30pm.  We checked into our room at the  urlLink Imperial Surf . We were in 19E. It was on the 19th floor. What a surprise. The view from the balcony was teriffic. The room was shit, though. It looked like it hadn't been painted since it was built (in the 70s!). Mum and Dad's blanket smelt like sex and marajuana. Not that I'd know what that smelt like, mind you.   On friday, we went to  urlLink Movie World . It was great! The first ride we went on was the Wild Wild West ride. I got quite wet. I was cold. Then we went to the Police Academy stunt show. It was very funny. I laughed lots. And I ate pop corn. We went on the Bat Man ride... It was average, but good for a laugh. Bat Woman can't drive for shit.  BAHA Then we went on the Scooby Doo ride. It was GREAT! Unexpected stuff though, like a big backwards freefall and sharp corners and stuff. We ate, went on some rides again (and stuff).   My parents convinced me to go on a roller coaster at Loony Tunes land. It was small, but fast! And fun. They said because I enjoyed it so much I should go on Lethal Weapon (I was terrified of it!). I did. After being stuck in line with my mum behind me so I couldn't escape, I got on. The ride up the first hill thing is the worst. Just the thought of the big drop. And I let people know I was scared of that... I was cussin heaps! Then it started... Whoosh. SO MUCH FUN! I loved it. So I went on it three more times. Go me!  That night I was set to meet Kieran after work. After 15 minutes of searching, we finally found each other. We got talking and then his mum rang and said "Come home". It was only 10pm, so meh! I only got fucking half an hour with my boyfriend. GUESS WHO'S NOT HAPPY?! But oh my god, he is soooo fine! I was gonna get a photo, but I forgot to buy a disposable camera. Damn!  The next day I went to Byron Bay (again with my parents). At Byron, there are soooo many hot guys! It's not fair...! We had fish n chips at the beach, whilst being harassed by a flock of seagulls. I wanted to kick them. They flew away.  I was supposed to meet Kieran again, but he said he mum isn't letting him out because he was home late last night. I was pissed off.   On Sunday, not much happened. We drove back to Brissy and did not much in the hotel room. We were staying in a Penthouse room at the  urlLink Novotel Brisbane . The room was really nice, and there was a Playstation 2 in there. But you  had to pay for it. Consequently, I didn't (play, that is).  I was up until midnight talking to Kieran. I really dig that boy.  We left the next morning at 1235. Yay.  Home by 3:30.
