In the last year, you along with over 1.2 million others have been driven from your home, displaced by the Government-Backed Janjawid militias.  You've witnessed homes looted and burned, towns bombed to the ground by the Sudanese Airforce, Girls systematically raped in front of their families, indiscriminant mass slaughters.  Before the last year, you lived on next to nothing; your country has one of the lowest GDP per capita.  Today you are living on even less.  Driven from one refugee camp to another, you are happy for any reprieve from the misery, no matter how fleeting.  Nevertheless you continue to come under attack despite the presence of international humanitarian aid.  You've lost some of your loved ones; the majority of your fellow villagers aren't so lucky.  There have been many apprehensions of people supposedly involved.  Prisoners suspeced of "sympathy" for the armed opposition to the gov't are held incommunicado, tried without due process, and tortured.  The Government not only turns a blind eye, but also is complicit in the hundreds killed and million plus displaced.  From ground level, it seems pretty hopeless.  Sounds wonderful, doesn't it?  What if it were your family?  Your loved ones?   For months, the international community sat by and did nothing about the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Darfur.  The amount of coverage in the mainstream media has, until recently, been absolutely criminal in its lack of exposure and dilligence in reporting.  Human Rights groups like Amnesty International(  urlLink   ) and Human Rights Watch (  urlLink   ) have been going it alone.  Now, the UN has finally mobilized, yet they have recieved less than half of the $349 million they have appealed for from in aid.  Hopefully these recent pleas will not fall on deaf ears, as countries such as Japan and France have the means to make a much larger contribution.  To its credit, the United States has earmarked a sizeable amount for foreign aid.  Yet, the world's lone superpower needs to take a much larger step in humanitarian leadership.  The UN has condemned the militias and their supporters, yet has stopped short of calling out the Sudanese government in their complicity.  It is hoped that the threat of sanctions will be enough to reign in the killing, yet much more needs to be done.  The Security Council has drafted a resolution proposing to suspend arms transfers to the militias.  Since, however, the militias are government-backed, it is all too clear that an arms embargo focused solely on the Janjawid will do little.  Amnesty International has called on the UN to suspend all arms trade with the Government; whether or not this happens is a matter of whether or not the US is willing to make the step of not only calling out those who have so far committed war crimes with impunity, but also to cut off the profits the arms trade would bring american firms.    The lack of true sanctions alone makes Colin Powell's words sound hollow.  Commendably, the US has taken a lead in the UN in the latest phase of the crisis.  The lack of urgency or meaningful sanctions, however, are glaring.  It is estimated that 15-20,000 troops would be needed on the ground to act as a peacekeeping force and secure the area.  The African Union has pledged to send 300 troops, clearly not enough. The utter silence from non-AU international bodies regarding this is glaring.  Powell has said that it would be "premature" to contemplate direct intervention.  Once again, we see utter hypocracy from the Bush administration, and further proof that the "humanitarian" reason to go to war in Iraq was a farce.  Here we see a deveoloping crisis with a clear consensus of condemnation from the international community.  More people have died in the last year in Sudan than in the year 2002 in Iraq, as a result of direct violence from blatantly complicit parties.  Where, then, is the aid?  Where is Bush's sabre rattling?  If nothing else, a cynic would say that this would be a windfall in the run-up to the election in November, a chance to prove that the US "really does care" about human rights WITHOUT alterior motives.  It is, however, not only the US at fault here, but the rest of the UN and EU as well.    It is clear that action is needed immediately.  Sadly, aid may come too late.  Look into Organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch if you care.  This is a situation that we all share a measure of responsibility for, and the time is now to mobilize.
