So i went out at 10+ and walk from my house to Braddell MRT station... halfway thru (abt 10.45), my cadets call and say that they are on their way here... i asked them where they are... they say they are at Queenstown... I was thinking "What the hell??? 10.45 and u r at Queenstown???"  i walk back to the market near my house... i eat wonton noodle... haha... tasty... then i walk back to the MRT station... on the way, i saw my primary sch friend... we juz exchanged a few words and left... nuntink to talk abt, seriously...  i walked to the MRT... feeling so SWEATY and SMELLY... puei!!! saw them coming out of the station... i 'scolded' them... hehe... we then walk out of the station... on the way up the escalator, i asked them why they wanto come braddell... they told me they wanto walk ard here... then i saw "open ur eyes and see what is braddell actually"... when we reached the top, my cadets were like "Huh?? All flats???"  I say, glad they know that... then we went into mac... they ate breakfast... finish liao, we walk to the study corner of a flat... the place is sooooo windy and cooling... haha... simply fantastic...  i went thru with them the whole First Aid manual with them... then some time later, a couple walk into the study corner... a PLUMP couple... then sat on the right side of the study corner and we sat on the left... they were talking so loud... i purposely tok louder to fight them... haha  one of my cadet say that the couple were looking over us here... then we begin discussing if they are robbers... haha... cuz they got the evil look... haha... then finally, finish teaching... we walk away in the speed of light... hehe...   The conclusion of today's event is that... Always siam(escape) when u see someone evil no matter he is actually good or not... haha...
