We've met on the class corridoor before our test, passing each other without even saying hi... We've met in her class room, yet I saw her sad face, then I backed off... After the class room incident, my pals and I went to the foodcourt to grab some bite. I coincidentaly saw her at the bus stop opposite the foodcourt. Suddenly, I had an urge to rush over to the bus stop, come up with some excuses just to get near her... But being a good friend as I am, I did not leave my pals for her, fearing that my love for her would be exposed to the whole world...  After finding nothing interesting to eat at the foodcourt, one of my friends suggested to go elsewhere to eat. I wasn't listening to him at all, I kept my eyes on the bus stop opposite, trying to catch a glimspe of her as much as possible... When they dragged me out of the foodcourt, with my eyes still peeled on the bus stop, I saw her leaving the bus stop, going towards that god forsaken foodcourt... At that very instant, I felt that it's god's will that we would take seperate paths in our lives. Come on, how could something so drama happen in real life, I wished it didn't, yet it's true...  I got a tip from another pal previously that says that she's pretty pissed up today, so, being a 'concerning' friend, I sent her a message. She replied, I replied, she got angry, I replied, END of messages. Here's the whole content: ME:"Y u today so sad?", HER:"huh got mehz...", ME:"See u today like sooooooo quiet, not like u mah...", SHE:"OH NOTHING LA.. HA", ME:"Ok... Den nvm lor... Relac lah..."  >  Now I feel like a piece of crap once again... After much thoughts, I feel that it's impossible for her to even like me, not even 1%... That's why the topic title today is Give. Up. ... I could only type it, say it, but my heart says otherwise. My heart keeps pumping faster and faster whenever I get within a 10 feet radius from her, my brain keeps generating images of her. WHAT THE HELL SHOULD I DO???!!!
