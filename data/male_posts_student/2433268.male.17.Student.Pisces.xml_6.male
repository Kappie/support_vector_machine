I mean, I have some big decisions to make this summer.  Like what do I really want to do with my life? Go join the army??  Go to college?  Sit around and do nothing?  So far the plan has been to just go and join the army.  They really seem to need people like me in military intelligence and in computer related areas too.  Plus my ASVAB score was 1 point away from perfect which was just something else.  But then I have to consider whether I'll survive through basic or not.  I really don't know...  Well, that seems enough for one entry... I'll just blog a little more later maybe.
