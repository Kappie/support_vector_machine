Plans of getting an early bus up to Cribbs then going back to Almondsbury foiled by me missing the bus. Went back home for a few hours. Bah. Caught the bus going direct to Almondsbury. Was so bumpy I doubted that there was actually any suspension at all. Stupid public transport. Bah.  Due to it being midweek there was virtually no one in store. Only 2 till monkies (me 'n' Sophie) but there weren't really enough customers to keep us busy most the time. So, nice, relaxing, and very. Very. Boring. Ahh well. Either tomorrow or Friday I get to go shopping. Erm, bah. Again.
