Everywhere I go There's something I really need Everyone I know Is someone I want to be Even though I don't really know me  I better pick it up Before I let it slip away I better stick it out Before I take another day Into mouth Everything I say fades out  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...  Can I open up your eyes? Only when the clouds break? Can I feel the light? Even though the world shakes Every night, You're my quiet satellite  Can I hold you close? Do her out of focus And everything I know I don't even know this It all falls through I'm here and I hear you  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...  Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Cause I need to, just to reach you Do you hear me? Coming clearly? Am I hollow? Just an echo  Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo... Echo, echo... We come, we go-woah No I don't want to be just another Echo, echo...
