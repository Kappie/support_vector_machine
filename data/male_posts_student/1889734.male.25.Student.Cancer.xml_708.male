Bush (news - web sites) refused to release oil from an emergency reserve to lower record gasoline prices, saying it would weaken the country in its 'war on terror'. "  All in the first sentence.  -First, Bush 'refused' to release oil.  Was there an official mandate to release the oil?  Is Bush getting in the way of someone who has the authority to do this?  This is like saying "Todd refused to post to the Blog in the past hour."  -Second, the SPR release would have no significant impact on the price of gas.  Hell, even John al-Kerry said the same thing back in 2001.  The amount that could be fed back into the system is too small to have a meaningful impact.  This comes up EACH and EVERY time gas prices go up.  Clinton dipped into the SPR all the time, to little effect other than glowing editorials from the NYT. -Third, why is the war on terror in quotes?  Reuters does this all the time, placing scare quotes around words such as 'terrorist' (after all, one man's terrorist is another man's patriot, right?).    Editorialized reporting has no place in journalism.  Unfortunately, it's now the rule rather than the exception.
