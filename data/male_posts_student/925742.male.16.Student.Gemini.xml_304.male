Its like looking at a wholly different person. I hardly recognized myself.   I guess we all grow up thinking that this is what we look like, and until we look at ourselves for a bit can we appreciate the change.  In other news, I had another bout with deja vu.  This time I was playing some Frag Ops.  I was on this arctic map (level) and here's what was deja vu, as I recall.  My teammate, a terrorist in a black ski mask walks up to a door with a glass window at the top.  He then turns around, looks directly at me, and walks right, to another door.  I eagerly look at the door he left to notice that nothing was there.  So then he walks away from the door on my right and I scan its window as well.  Then I come face to face with a Counter-Terrorist.  The door is between both of us and I hastily type 'Spec Ops guy HERE!'.  Thats pretty much what was deja vu.  Then I continued playing the game.  How lame.  It was understood, I am hungry now, therefore I eat and sleep, gonna what, is. I the healthy habit without of being have known thats, but me whom gonna it does what, am it corrects, is? I center be completed cripes.
