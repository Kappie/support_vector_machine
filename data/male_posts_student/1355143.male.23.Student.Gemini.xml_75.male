The bars and clubs opened at midnight so we started at my friends house and then went to the bars which are like 10 minutes from his house.  I met alot of people and one girl asked for my phone number.  The strangest thing happened when I was on my way home I saw this girl waiting for a taxi and we started talking and decided to take the cab together because then we can save the start fee. Ok so when we come to my house and I give the driver my card, but its denied so he tries again and in the meanwhile I get the girls phone number coz she had offered to pay it if it wouldn't come through... Finally it did and I went in. Ok so I decided to send her a text message and tell her that if she was paying more than usual and the start fee didn't pay off I´d pay her back.    Well she called me and we talked for a while and she told me that after I left the cab the driver had said to her that I was definitely popping E.  Im not gonna lie about that Im not the healthiest of 'em all but I dont take (illegal) drugs.  We then decided that I'd come over and we just talked alot and I'm meeting her later tonight. And to clarify things I didn't have sex with her... yet.  And for Tim ... she has no kids at all:)  Úlli
