Oh woe is me! With the time I spend picking my nose I could convert all my old posts, so why don't I? How could I be such a fool to post on this antiquated message board? I'm so ashamed! Jeff, save me from the error of my ways!  In other news, Megan Smith would make a great antihero in the movie of my life. Launchcast, online Scrabble, OddTodd.com . . . she has introduced all of these to me and all of them have thrown weeks of my life into the circular file. I must now go Brockport and do that research stuff I procrastinated for a month on, and quickly, before she signs on again.  After a month or so of having a poor battery in my laptop (40 minutes tops) this new one feels like running around naked in a shopping mall: free and exciting. These three paragraphs are all about the Internet, so you can tell how my life is really going this week. Out.
