Ian found me asnazzy private server and gave me some burned discs, so I wouldn't have to go through the tedious  download times. Since, I've become completely hooked. Resistance is futile. Ragnarok has claimed my soul. :(   But other than that, pretty typical week. Worked. Made comics (Need to do two catch ups though! Oops!). Read. Idled on MSN all freaking day. Spending the day CHI-LESS. I swear, if I was stonger, didn't care about going to jail, and lived across the ol' Atlantic, I'd go and give BT a little Urza Smash. *TERRORIST THREAT, TERRORIST THREAT* Oh, just kidding. I would neverdo such a thing! *LIE, LIE, LIE* Hey, shut up. *OKAY*
