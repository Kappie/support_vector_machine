Even something as small as a pin,  Still helps me to cope    Everyday unexpected,  One happy, one sad.  Time should be suspended,  It's almost driving me mad.    Guessing at every turn,  Struggling along the road.  Lessonsare stilllearnt,  But can I handle the load?    So much hurt,  So much pain,  Yet a beautiful smile,  Washes all doubt away.    Human nature to seek,  Human nature to shun,  Will I ever find you,  Omysterious one?    Written by: Janet the cOnFuSeD    Note: Sort of like a riddle. Give me a suggestion for the title :P
