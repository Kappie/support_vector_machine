Mr. Tony Tan said I was blowing 'hot air' throughout the entire essay, but tell me how not to when you have just finished your lunch and you are on the verge of dozing off on the piece of paper which you seem to mistake to be a piece of white pillow. With green lines of course.  So it's an incredible 18/50 for my essay, which, compared to my Economics essay, is heaven on earth. Try getting 11.  Economics is an intriguing subject, a subject no matter how much I try to dabble in I never seem to be able to get my desired (or even less than desired) mark.  Yet the intrigue seems to be preventing me to fill in a drop-form just yet.  I'll hold out.
