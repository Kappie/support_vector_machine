Smokers bring in far too much revenue. If I was in government I'd put forward the proposal that all the quit smoking stuff would go onto the pharmecutical benefits fund. That way, smokers will get a better deal.  I say: bring the cost of a packet of nicotine patches down to $10.00 and I reckon you'd see FAR less smokers around. As it is, I am one of the people out there that buy patches anyways. It costs me about $30-35 per packet but I do know it is worth it. A packet of cigarettes cost about $9.50 - 10.00 (also dependant on what you actually smoke too). Now, multiply that by about 5 and that's how much a week I used to spend on cigarettes. A packet of patches lasts for 7 days. I do know that it is definitely worth it. I think the catch of it is that with the patches you fork out the $30-35 in one hit whereas, with the smokes, it's a smaller amount so it lulls you into thinking that it's not as expensive.  But it's all a moot point anyways. I mean, seriously, why would the government give a damn? Smokers are one of the major revenue raisers in the country. It doesn't matter that they die at a higher rate than the average non-smoker. Most smokers die of diseases that are quick killers so they don't hang around too long draining the medical budget. It's better for the government if these hapless individuals die young than old because then the government will REALLY have to look after them as they get the pension and the population ages more and more rapidly. As it is, Australia has a population that is too old, while the younger population don't want to breed to help pour money into the government's coffers.  So what it comes down to is this: Smokers die. Younger. If the smokers die then it means the government doesn't have to support them when they're sitting around wearing old people diapers on the pension. The government saves money. It's all cost-effective.   Lowman X.
