If you don't know what emulation is, in the terms of the way i'm using it, it is using programs for your computer to simulate game consoles in order to play games on your PC.  Did i mention it was free, and so are the games, althought it is illegal to have any of the games for over a day if you don't own an acutall copy of the game.   Anyways, i've used a variety of emulators before:  the SNES9xW for the SNES games that i wanted to play, Visual Boy Advance (really odd title) for the GBA games that i wanted to play, and a whole host of other emulators that i couldn't find ROM's for (such as Gamecube or PS2).  A ROM is a Read Only Memory image of the original cartridge (even though the next gen consoles all use DVD's).  In simpler terms, ROMs are the games that the emulators play.   Well, i just beat MGS: TTS, and am in love with the entire MGS series, starting from it's roots on the PSX (i tried getting Metal Gear for the NES, but it didn't work too well, and it looks kind of stupid).  Well, i sucessfully downloaded the MGS ISO file, unzipped them (hard, because the original file extension was .7z which stands for 7-zip, probably something very few normal people have heard of.  Massive condensation capabilities.) and got the emulator to play them.  Thats all fine and dandy, but what did it take to set up the emulator.   First of all i had to get the actual base emulator file.  I got that, unzipped (with winzip this time, nice and easy ^_^) and ran.  Next came the configuration wizard.  It first screamed: Playstation BIOS is not detected, go and search for blah blah blah in your favourite search engine.  Well, i got the BIOS, got that working, then it screamed about not having a video adapter.  Ok, got that.  Then it worked.  The picture was choppy but the sound was alright.  I got a new video adaptor.  Video great, sound sort of echos.  Get a new sound adaptor. Video lags, sound lags.  Switch back to original sound adaptor.  Both are fine.   Right now, i have it running windowed, at 640x480 resolution, and it looks crystal clear.  Running it full screen makes it a bit pixilated, so i run it windowed.  Getting this for free is a good bonus ^_^ and i'm going to try to beat the game on my PC now.   Lates
