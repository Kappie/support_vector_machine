I can't say there's anything better than waking up, looking at the clock, and realizing you just slept for like 12 freaking hours. heh. although part of me is like, "wow you idiot, you just threw away half your day!" *SMACK!* but hey, it's all good cause I have no big plans for today anyway. Meg Walsh, Max's ex-gf is having a party cause she has an empty house till tomoro (her parents went away), and some kids will be bringing some "beverages" (vodka, coconut rum, bacardi raz/cranberry juice, beer!) but I prolly won't be drinking seeing as I can't sleep over since I have work in the morning/I have to drive. Meh, it might be entertaining nonetheless, Max and I will prolly stop by for a lil bit in any case. Seems like most everybody I wanna hang out with is going away this coming week. GRRR. And then there's the  certain people  I almost never get to talk to! *sigh* Time to go scrounge for food. Lates                   -Brendan Michael
