But I made 2 trips home to get some things I forgot.  We are all set up but Kent's computer is having issues... :(  I sent him America's Army and it transfered at 300 kb/s.  But the Dell won't install anything... :(  I think he has some major issues.  So instead of our LAN, I am playing alone while he... tries to download the file from another server.  Finally, he just found a good server.  Should be done in and hour.  I still don't believe it will solve what I want... :(  Let's hope.  This would have been so awesome... :(  Oh well, HAVE FAITH!  Now, Kent is watching Red vs Blue that I sent him and I am still, playin' alone.  HURRAY!  The download is complete!  Yeah, I have been writing this post on and off for a few hours... f*ck this post.  I am pissed off at a few people... CAPICHE!   urlLink    LAN Party Panorama
