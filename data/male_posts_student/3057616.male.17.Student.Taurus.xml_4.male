[As christians, we believe it is finished (because this is the right answer what.. the bible says so) - but... really really believe? We often fall on the 1st part, his blood for our total forgiveness. When you sin afew mins ago, do you believe its forgiven also? Or maybe the handphone you stole from your friend? - Big sin or small sin, recent or not.. It is all forgiven, totally if you are a christian - That is what happen when the divine exchange took place on the cross. Jesus took all your sins to the cross, and God the father punish the sins on his body, God cannot punish our sins now, because its all been justified. ]  TeenZeal Sermen taken from Hobbes' Webby     I'm so confused... Haiz... The message of Grace, the Gospal of Grace... We all need grace... But does that mean that when we receive God's grace, we will be able (even if we dont like it) to do things that are bad, and still be able to enter the Kingdom of God?  I have already attended a number of New Creation Church's services.. they are inexhorably excellent, you can feel the heavy presence of God in the place...  But why do churches condamn this Church?  Is it because.. 1) Their teaching's in incorrect? - But then each teaching is back up well with the scriptures! So how can it be incorrect if the scriptures is God-breathed?  2) Their teaching's are one sided? - Does it matter? Moral virtue is man made, and only by doing what's right in God's eyes is most important... And given the new covenent, we only need Jesus, to love him and to honour him...  3) They are jealous? - [Financially]Possibly... With a revenue of over 100,000 a week, its not surprising.... - [Strength] Possibly... 10,000... need I say more? - [Holiness] Nah.... But let he who is without sin cast the first stone...   Haiz.. I can go on for a long long time...  Recently I've became much closer with Yuan Long and David... David is actually a really nice guy... Unlike what Jeremy has been spreading.. Charming, cute... act cool sometimes.... Only thing is that he's a bit hot-headed...  Both Yuan Long and David come from reach families... Unlike mine... So they all can afford alot of things that I cant.... Lolz... i haven even been to fish and co. to eat before without my parents....  Dono... I kinda like Hobbes... but never mind... I'm straight now.. lolz... Restrain!!!  Mood : Blur. Confused.. hope ppl who read will get tag an opinion to the answer...
