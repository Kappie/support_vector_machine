Go and check it out. These guys are on a whole other level from most of the popular hip-hop out there these days. I can't really explain it...their music is a synergy of a lot of different things...hip-hop, rock, jazz, soul, etc...and they know how to flow. I don't even want to say anything because I don't think I can give them due credit. I also got the  The Pretty Toney Album ...Bobby's pretty much on with his review of that one. And for the record, I could have won that game if I wanted to. 'Nuff said.  Keep talking and I'll be in the SA at your doorstep with a beating to hand out...I wouldn't want to have to hurt you, man!!
