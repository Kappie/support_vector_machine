For some reason i started thinking why do i always hide behind my own shadow, sorta speak. Like how somethings bothering me, i'll never speak up and tell anyone, i always just mask it with a sorta smile or not smile at all (which i normally do)and keep going, i doubt that its because im shy or anything tho, anywho (still on the topic of yesterday) i went to the mall/movies, with kevin, maria, kris, and luke. It started out really cool, but as the day went on it kinda got alittle tiresome but i picked on maria the whole while (haha biotch XP). we went to see dodgeball, it didnt turn out as good as i thought it would though which also sucks. then after that we went to the arcade, that was kinda fun, not too much to turn around the whole day but just enough. I beat kevin....again in tekken 4 and now he cant say that the button was suck which caused him to loose, because it wasnt, then a couple mins later since i was over playing some tennis game that was kinda out of the view from the group i decided to go get a icee, so as i did that, i came back to atleast finsih the tennis game but it took my quarter (bitch) and i saw my mom walk out of one of the movies, and i really wanted to leave cuz i ready to go, so i went with my mom and maria came around walking to the restroom and passed by my mom and me and then my mom asked who was she and i told her, and me knowing my mom of course shes going to turn around and speak, which she did. while leaving i didnt say peace to anyone which to me ive done plenty of times before and dont find it that big of a deal but maria said kris was pissed over it (big whoops)then we went to columbia crossing to get to the macaroni grill (my fav resturaunt) and yea had dinner, then went home. the only thing im actually happy about is that i finshed my 1st graphic over the size of 400x400 and version 2 of my site is underconstruction. woo7
