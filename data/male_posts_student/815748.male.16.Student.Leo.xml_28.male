I don't have any new funny stuff today, but you can see Loren's blog for a hilarious conversation we had (http://mandyell.blogspot.com), and I'll include an old thing that I haven't posted yet.  These days I've been reading a lot of MSN Learning and Research columns (http://encarta.msn.com/column/).  Many are very interesting, like two about head transplants and parthogenesis.  The majority aren't that gruesome, for the weak-stomached audience.  I've written an essay on Shackleton vs. Odysseus that's six full pages long (plus a few small pictures).  Eat that, Pavarotti (and he says, "Okay. Crunch!")  Here's the funny thing:  Often in math class, my teacher (and today on Law and Order: SVU, the ADA) says, "Did anything about this give you pause?" I always respond (somewhat audibly), "Aaaah! What happened to my hands??!!!!"  Hilarious.
