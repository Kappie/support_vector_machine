So i slept in until eleven today... i thought my dad would make me go mow the lawn early, but he never did. I told him i would do it later when it was cooler. It was just way too hot out. So i woke up and went over to babysit the Ross's cats... twenty bucks... oh so nice... Then my dad asked me if i wanted to go drive and pick up some pizza. I did, and parked extremely well! Wooo for parking.  Crying, Crying - Sugarcult  I watched the Michael Jackson movie on VH1 today. It was really good except it was completely biast to proving Jacksons innocence, and didnt talk about any of the evidence practically proving he did it. I could see that he didnt, cuz in his mind hes like a 12 year old, and twelve year olds sleep over at each others house and dont do anything bad. But he is an adult, and they have sexual tensions... and he didnt really have a wife at these times, and hes a strong Jahovas witness, so self pleasure might be ruled out, i dont know, im not a witness...So i could see him getting carried away and going after his closest resorce, little kids. The ending of the movie really sucked too.  Yeah, so later on i went and washed the cars. ANd then it started raining and i couldnt mow the lawn. Then the Marlins played, my mom made homeade brownies, and i just played some video games.  I got my train schedule today, if you want to see what the times are for the train for dreyfoos, go to my post below that i posted earlier.  I htink since i saw the Michael Jackson movie, a movie dedicated to the Jackson 5, and Michael Bashires documentary of Michael all in the past two days (VH1 is having some Jackson explosion for some reason) I am going to use my favorite MJ song, even though i dont really like him and i think he's creepy, I still like some of his music... COME ON! WHO DOESNT???  Rock with you Michael Jackson  1st Verse  Girl, close your eyes Let that rhythm get into you Don't try to fight it There ain't nothin' that you can do Relax your mind Lay back and groove with mine You got to feel the heat And we can ride the boogie Share that beat of love Chorus I wanna rock with you (all night) Dance you into day (sunlight) I wanna rock with you (all night) We're gonna rock the night away  2nd Verse Out on the floor There ain't nobody there but us Girl, when you dance There's a magic that must be love just take it slow 'Cause we got so far to go When you feel that heat And we're gonna ride the boogie Share that beat of love  Chorus I wanna rock with you (all night) Dance you into day (sunlight) I wanna rock with you (all night) We're gonna rock the night away  Bridge And when the groove is dead and gone (yeah) You know that love survives So we can rock forever, on Refrain I wanna rock with you I wanna groove with you I wanna rock with you I wanna groove with you  Chorus I wanna rock (all night) with you girl (sunlight) Rock with you, rock with you girl (yeah)    (all night) Dance the night away  Chorus I wanna rock with you (yeah) (all night) Rock you into day (sunlight) I wanna rock with you (all night) Rock the night away Feel the heat feel the beat Rock you into day (sunlight) I wanna rock - rock the night away
