Evil.  * Untill I can afford to buy a .com domain name, use  urlLink this  URL to get to my site. I know, it's not as easy to remember, but it's not as if people ever come here anyway, right?  * Internet Explorer sucks. However, it's light-years better than Netscape 4.07 which Adelaide University insists on you using for some reason. * Go download  urlLink Opera  if you can - it's much bettar than IE or Netscape, but you sacrifice a few non-standard things, such as that retarded Gator popup and other ActiveX plugins, but you get transparent and alphablended .PNG's!  Right, so I've signed myself up for a three-month contract with  urlLink Lithoptix  for DSL... but I'm hearing bad things over at the  urlLink Whirlpool Forums , so I'm more than a bit worried.  =(
