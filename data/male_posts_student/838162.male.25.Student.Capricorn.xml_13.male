This one is much closer to home so I figured deserves the honor of being the subject of the the first post in the category.     urlLink Results of Singapore WCG 2002     Counter-strike 1st : GBR Grudg3 2nd : GBR Edg3  3rd : PwA  FCOT 1st : Sisterhood 2nd : GBR Sureal 3rd : Seraphim 4th : Zodiac  Day of Defeat 1st : |-SS-| Team One 2nd : --=GHOST=-- 3rd : Macs  Starcraft 1st : [aLt]duckie 2nd : 4B@Family  3rd : [aLt] NiRvana  Age of Empires 1st : Delin 2nd : Rising_One 3rd : Malcom  Congratulations to all winners.   > FaL speaks: Good to see gaming getting more recognised, since I am a gamer at heart. However sometimes I wonder at the ways and means. I enjoy gaming as I see it as a another form of media, of entertainment. Something like the mainstream standards such as movies and television. However I believe it to be a higher form that those two, due to the interaction and social expects that PC gaming can provide. But as I see younger and younger people move into (and succeed) in these high profile tournaments it looks like some of them are treating it as another way to prove dominance, to boast egos and even as a form of escape. I have nothing against competition (sports are great and can really bring out the best of oneself) but one should not do it to a point that one neglects family, work/school and friends.   >
