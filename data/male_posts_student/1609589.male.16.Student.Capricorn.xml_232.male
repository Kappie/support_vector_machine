I usually wouldn't do one of these, but it's time to let people know how much ass i kick in numbered-list form.  *NOTE* if I didn't answer a question, for example, if it didn't pertain to me, I just omitted the question.  Name: Jesse Snider  1. Act your age – What the hell are you talking about? Age? I lost count at 59356.  3. Chore you hate – Yard work. I hate yardwork.  4. Dad's name - Richard.  6. Favorite actor – I have one of these every once in a while, but then i decide they're full of crap. Lately it's been Tom Cruise, I'm really respecting him right now for The Last Samurai.  7. Gold or silver - Gold. You can mold it fairly easily.  8. Hometown – Irving Texas   9. Instruments you play – I play drums sometimes, and the Dulcimer.  10. Job title – You all know this one, professional ass-kicker.  11. Kids – What about them?  12. Living arrangements – Let's see... my futon is arranged into "bed-mode" near my door, and my bed is in the corner, while my computer is in my room's inset. Just kidding. I live with me mom, dad, and brother.  13. Mom's name - Kellie. Why were the mom questions all spaced out?  15. Overnight hospital stays – None. I don't even think i've ever been there because of me being sick. Last time i remember, i visited my mom earlier after she had surgery.  16. Phobia – It's even hard for me to believe sometimes, but i am claustrophobic in certain situations. Like, when thinking about Saddam Hussein's hole, knowing you couldn't get out just by pushing, is kinda unsettling.  *snaps out of it* HEY!!! Shaddap! I has no phobias!!!  17. Quote you like – "Can I just play devil's advocate for a minute? You commie bitch!"  18. Religious affiliation – Athiest/UU. Just as an example of how non-christian i am, I don't say the pledge of alleigance.  19. Siblings – 1 brother.  20. Time you wake up? TECHNICALLY i wake up at 6:00 on school days, but it ends up being around 6:15. On other days, who the hell cares?  21. Vegetable you refuse to eat – Any kind of heated/cooked vegetable. They're not meant to be served in an almost-liquid state in spaghetti, people!   22. Worst habit – Being an asshole at things i really couldn't care about. Like, this is a stoopid example, but i'll be playing Star Wars Galaxies, every time it informs me that i've entered or left a city, i almost uncontrollably think in a sarcastic tone, "Woah, thanks for telling me, jackass, i might not have known!" Then i kick myself in the foot for being such an idiot.  23. X-rays you've had – Teef. Lotsa lotsa teef.  24. Yummy food you make – Hambuggah patties, bitch! What, what?   25. Zodiac Sign - Capricorn. The goat. The SUPER-goat!  26. Last Cigarette: Fuck you, smoking is for the weak.  29. Last Library Book Checked Out: Uhh.... uhmm..
