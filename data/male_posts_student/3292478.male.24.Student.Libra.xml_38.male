" Never before ", I wailed in dismay, " Have I seen such a bunch of obnoxious, intolerant and bloody annoying people in my life ". And therein lies the magic of BB, it gets people riled and gets them talking about it.  I know for a fact  Marco  is going to annoy the shit out of me, the minute he came on screen he was doing my head in! In fact nearly all of the housemates annoy the hell out of me, and the only three who don't are my predictions for the final 3.  First up is  Jason   urlLink      Next is  Shell    urlLink      And finally  Nadia   urlLink      Although credit has to go to  Victor  who, while everyone else took about 5 minutes to decide on their luggage nomination, took about 0.005 seconds to proclaim  Kitten  as the most undeserving and fucked in the head!    urlLink      And then promptly comforted her when the nomination was announced!  What a dude !
