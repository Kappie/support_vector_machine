You may laugh, but good toilet paper can be the difference between me in a good mood, and me in a bad mood in the morning.  My dog. I was able to keep in touch with the rest of my family relatively easily via MSN, email, and the phone, but there was no way I could give my dog a virtual pat on the tummy over the internet. I did talk to her on the phone, though, and her tail began to wag when she heard my voice, apparently. Also, it's really nice to wake up and have her sleeping at my feet.  Sleeping till whenever I want. It's about 12:15 PM right now, and I just woke up. Damn it feels good to get a good night's rest. Speaking of that...  My bed. Unlike the mattresses at Carleton, it's  more  than three inches thick.  Q-Tips. I forgot them at home and never thought to buy them at Carleton. Boy, was I glad to have those little SOBs back.   The five things I miss most about Shad Carleton:   Obviously the people. I wasn't even gonna' mention this, figuring that it was a given, but here we are. I'm just that sentimental a geek. I'm just a big social animal, so I really miss the all-people, all-the-time feeling you get at Shad.  The wide selection at meal-times. Here I'm limited to what I feel like cooking/what's in the fridge.  The schedule. There my being actually had something of a purpose; here, I'm free to fuck away the days as I please. Yes, the lectures may have been boring as Hell sometimes, but at least we were all bored together and for a  reason .  The creative fashion choices I would make so that I wouldn't have to do laundry. Here it's back to normal scrubbiness, wearing pyjamas 24/7.  And of course, once again, the people. It's worth saying twice how awesome you guys are.   If anyone's feeling extra sad (as I am), download the following songs: "Pizza Day" by the Aquabats, "Drunk Again" by Reel Big Fish, and "San Francisco Payphone" by Catch-22. They're all ska bands and personal favourites of mine. "Drunk Again" might make you even more sad, but it's such a good song that it just begs mentioning.
