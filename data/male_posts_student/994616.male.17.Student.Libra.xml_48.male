It looks like it will have a round collar, but then there's a bit cut out. i hope that made sense. And it has "Groupindividual" written across the top, which makes me look like i have broader shoulder. Which reminds me, it is impossible for me to find a suit that fits because my shoulders are too wide and my waist too thin... i thoughts how it was supposed to be. It was only $18  Another brown T-shirt without wacky collar. This ones a light kinda yellow-tan colour, I'm not that big of a fan of that. then it has brown writing and lines scrawled horizontally across it. It went against my "no horizontal line" rule, but mom liked it, so I got it. Another downside is that it  looks incredibly gay. It will be a low wear item.  To go with the shirts I got some jean shorts. they have these random velcro flaps, that do nothing at all except, of course, aesthetasize. they're 3/4 shorts. I have wanted a pair of 3/4 jean shorts for a while - John Hobbey wears them all the time, and he is cool so then the shorts must be cool. (except they remind me of a video-game for some reason)  I also got a blue grey shirt that has some fluorescent orange on it. it says M ONE 1, and a little square of it on the collar, i liked it the best of the shirts from Depot (all of the above). its slightly tighter, i could just like it because i fit in a small.  Then to General Pants Co for board shorts. i HHATE board shorts, they are the bane of my fashion existence. They VERY loosely follow fashion, and usually have very "busy" patterns.  Imagine my surprise when I found a very nice simple brown (my new favorite colour in clothes for some reason) pair of board shorts.   Then on lay by i have:  At esprit I got a pair of linen 3/4 shorts. they're really nice and light. they're plain white. Really simple. Cool pockets which are hard to explain. I really like them.   The at JAG (my favorite clothes store) i got another (third) brown T. this one has a faded print on the front saying "Floats Like A (picture of butterfly)" and on the back it says "Stings like A (picture of bee)"  And finally there was a pair of army print shorts in JAG, just sitting on the rack they looked but ugly but they looked good on the guy in the picture, so i tried them o and they didn't look too bad.  The catch? I'm not allowed to wear any of it untill schoolies, it's part of a graduation gift.   I'm supposed to be doing math right now, but i decided to write a really long boring post, my aim is 500 words, half my change essay.  I just can not do math at home, the only time i can study math is when I am at someone else's place like Luke or my tutor's.  I'm listening to  Never Give Up On The Good Times  from the album "Spiceworld" by The Spice Girls for more info on them click  urlLink here . I'd give this song about 4 stars out of 5
