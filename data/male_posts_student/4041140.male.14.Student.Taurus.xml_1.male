Currently coding for the game has'nt started yet but joe will soon have the program soon.  And conor is making up the idea of the story.   A name for the game or the world in which the players live inhas'nt been the decided yet but any help from viewers or comments are helpful. Plus you don't need to be registered to post comments.  That's all for now have a nice day,  Conor.
