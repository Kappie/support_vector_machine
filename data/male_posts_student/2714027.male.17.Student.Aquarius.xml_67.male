I gave a couple of friends a lift to school, which went fairly flawlessly, although it was a little slow as we got caught up in rush hour. Everyone congratulated me, which was cool, and I was asked quite a few questions about various universities which I'd visited. At lunchtime, I went off for a quick thirty minute drive with another friend, which we didn't get very far in.   I had no last lesson, so another friend and I went for a drive round the outskirts of the town. We ended up going down a whole load of country lanes which were alarmingly scary because of the number of blind corners and narrow roads. Needless to say, I'm not driving there any time soon!  The removal of my 'L plates' seems to have an effect on how other road users treat me as well, with white van men trying to undertake me through bus lanes on two occassions and one 4x4 pushing through the tightest of gaps just to get an extra 20m forward. On the other hand, I did notice that a fair number of drivers were courteous anyway, letting me through and waiting patiently.  Just after you pass is supposedly the most vunerable time for any driver and I can certainly appreciate that. I feel excited when I'm driving, but when I get out of the car I think, "that was scary", "why didn't I do that?", "I might of crashed then!" and so on, but as long as I stay clear of those country roads, I think I'll be okay...
