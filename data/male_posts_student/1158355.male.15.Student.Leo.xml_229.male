I went to Alex's house with Tom and Matt. Then we picked up this girl Michelle, then we went to the mall. Then back to Alex's. Then to Nate's. Then back to Alex's. Had pizza. Came home. Fun day. Got home around 8:30 I think. Then I chirped out my window and Ahmad and Mal greeted me over to Jim's. The gang was there with a poker night and the fish were fresh out of the sea. Six tea biscuits settle down on go. Jimmy has a girlfriend, awesome. She's in my grade, I forget her name. Yea, we decided to reunite Capture the Flag on roller blades at St. Andrew's and football. If this is true, this summer will truely kick some cheek pads.
