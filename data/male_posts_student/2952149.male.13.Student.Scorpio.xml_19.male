Anyways, the best part of my day was seeing stacy and she let me copy her Yellowcard CD which by the way kicks ass lol. Oh and i felt like such a dumbass in 5th period cuz me, deidra or is it spelled diedra, and stacey were talkin about homosexuallity and i said that gay marriage was wrong. I forgot that deidra's aunt was gay and she was about to get married. I was like "Oh shit im so sorry!" but she was so pissed and i dont blame her. Oh well. Later.
