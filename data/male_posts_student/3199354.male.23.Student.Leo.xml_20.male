From the chick who added me to her friends on that social network cuz her friend told her she "had to" to that friend of the household saying that she thought I'd be more self-confident with my best friend as a roommate, people just have an amazing way with words sometimes. And the random people that add me to their messenger, talk for a while usually boring me more than i am them until they start to act weird. And the ugly white trailer trash that yell at me to slow down while i stare directly at them and continue unfazed. And the chick from my class that got a hold of me by messenger and i thought had a great convo with but didn't seem to close it sweetly enough for me to be sure. And all the random women in my life who act super-friendly one day and cold the next. Its ever-changing, imperfect, sometimes boring, sometimes insecure, but almost every one of these things works itself out with a cool head. Heck I'll probably end up dating most of the women that I've mentioned there. Meeting people, making friends, and attracting dating material has never been this easy.  Party frieday, and its gonna be grand! At least 3 awesome babes and a good friend of mine will be there, so it should be a blast. And my girl-friend (girlfriend?) will be back tomorrow as well, while I probably won't see her til later this weekend. Oh yeah...almost forgot...payday...sweet....    I've got a bad feeling about this....but its all okay with me.
