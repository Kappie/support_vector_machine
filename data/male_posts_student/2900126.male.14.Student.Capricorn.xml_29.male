I saw "Garfield", watched movies, and ate alot of ice cream and popcorn. Yeah the fun stuff.  So yeah my highlight of the weekend was on the way back home singing in the car with my mom. We had so much fun singing Carole King songs.     " I feel the earth move under my feet, I feel the sky tumblin down, tumblin down"
