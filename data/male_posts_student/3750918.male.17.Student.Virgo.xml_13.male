From FOXNEWS:    "Conservative African Americans are wondering why American minority groups are not as incensed by a racially inflammatory cartoon featuring  Condoleezza Rice  as they are about similar material featuring non-Republican targets."    The African American conservative group called Project 21, had to seek out the other minority groups and ASK them to express their outrage, because their wasn't any coming from them.  I think that's odd, because usually they express outrage over the most off the wall stretches of what they interpret as racism.  Such as that 300 pound black man who was high on PCP and attacking cops in Connecticut, who died from the beating he received by the officers trying to defend themselves.  But a comic that was published that refers to Condoleezza Rice as President Bush's "house nigga" didn't really seem to bother them that much.  The politics that get played, and the double standards disgust me.  Here's a link to the comic:  urlLink RIDICULOUS
