It was scary at first, but after it felt really good. like masterbating for the first time. ok� that was a little too much. :-) so what started as small got bigger and bigger. graduation practices and.. lol.. joel marshall.. filled my thoughts for the last days. suddenly it was grad. night. everything seemed so perfect� except Mrs. Zahrobsky�s fucked up balloon arch. well yeah it was beautiful.   and the dance was way awesome. the theme was Hollywood, and boy was it a night with the stars. I told a bunch of people that I was.. well� you noe the word. The night was ending.. tears were falling.. and dances were being danced. Shout outs to des cuneo, lexi!, mikki, maddie, amanda and naomi for havin� fun with me on the dance floor.   the night ended, and janis and I ran around givin� everyone hugs and saying our last goodbyes. I still remember elena rossman asking me for a hug even though she knew we would see each other the next day. You noe I never really realized how much I was gonna miss these people until after they were out of my life. But you cant live in the past forever.   I dropped Janis at home, promising to call her before I picked her up the next day. And then I went home and passed out on my bed. it was over. middle school was over. it was finally over.
