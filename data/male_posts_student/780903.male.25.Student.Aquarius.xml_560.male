Oh, you're in section two It's sad to say but I am not In the same section as you  In what section are you? My professors are best And our scores were highest on the Law School Admissions Test  Ooh, ooh, Nobody knows it When they assigned Which section was mine Ooh, ooh, Nobody knows it (nobody knows) The Lord gave to me The best one to be Oh, the best section to be  So in what section are you? Oh, you're in section two I'm surely glad I'm not you  And we have the Rhodes guy But you have the Marshall And they have the guy who founded A now-it's-bankrupt dot-com   No classes on Fridays And yours are 7AM We both have an hour for lunch At least that's better than them  Ooh, ooh, Nobody knows it When they assigned Which section was mine Ooh, ooh, Nobody knows it (nobody knows) The Lord gave to me The best one to be Oh, the best section to be  So in what section are you? Oh, you're in section two I'm surely glad I'm not you  [dance break]  Ooh, ooh, Nobody knows it When they assigned Which section was mine The Lord gave to me The best one to be Oh, the best section to be  In which section are you? In which section are --  In which section are -- In which section are you?
