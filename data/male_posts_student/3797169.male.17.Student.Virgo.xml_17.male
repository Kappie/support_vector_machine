Now, don't confuse ladies with girls, girls you drive, ladies you ride...or they ride you depending on you're preferrence, but that's another blog entirely.  So we're talking and I say to him that I think I'll end up with a short girl. Not a shorty keep in mind, a SHORT girl. And you may say, "Well, at 6' 6" just about everyone is short right?" Well, I'm not talkin relative. I was thinkin' someone along the lines of a tall midget, don't ask me why. Cam came to my rescue. He said, and I hope this is true, that I'm likely to end up with a sporty girl, a "Lady Lancer" perhaps. A volleyball player was mentioned, no one in particular, just a player, and I remembered something. Volleyball players are usually pretty hot. Volleyball shorts are like god's gift to men who like the ass, they'll make any girl look like she's packin' but then again, so do "tight butt jeans."  I'm thinking, "A lady lancer who smacks balls around might not be so good...but it's worth a shot."  Now all I gotta do is get rid of the baby fat. To get to the baby fat I gotta work off the "I'm a fat bastard" fat and the "Lazy Shit" fat. It's all possible, and if the girl comes in, it'll be much more likely.
