Humm,, Such a good woman,,, I wonder if she is married..  Exactly four or five weeks ago, I asked her of what french grammar book would help me improve my french comprehension and she tipped me off a bit saying she would let me know right next week. And so far there have not been any news from her on my demand but today she broke the silence. And I thanks her for the book she herself bought for me. How grateful am I... I felt real affection and such an encouraging feeling that no one else ever has made me feel.   I will never ever forget what she did to me. Great. Just great.  Now, I'm here at the computer room they say. I dug up French grammar for about 2 hours before and crawled myself into this room to hear Federal News Radio which is the internet radio broadcasting from the United States and they keep me updated about what is going on around the world with Ap network news and other reports. Also they are my pipelines to the source of both the domestic news in the US and international affairs in which I have much interest. Though The news they are sending over the net may not affect my daily life, I feel much privileged , I dont know why.. I shall not feel this way.. Probably I'm still living here in Korea where English is never spoken openly.
