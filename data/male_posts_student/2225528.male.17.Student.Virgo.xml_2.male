When i reached there the lecturer was asking me where was i from.. by looking at my white shirt and brown pants, he assumed that i'm from CHUNG HUA!! arggghh! nvm.. during the session.. my stupid friend visited a website.. my school website.. the lecturer asked him who did it.. and all the ppl from my school pointed at me.. and so.. i was disqualified for the web design competition... ended up being a judge :/
