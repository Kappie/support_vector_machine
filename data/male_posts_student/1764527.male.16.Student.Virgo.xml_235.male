 Okay, I did like a good son should and tried on all the shorts that Mom bought me from the thrift store. I'm going to keep two pairs of shorts that are navy blue because I can wear them with some of my shirts but the faded brown, faded green and odd pleated denim ones I can't really see myself wearing. Unfortunately, I don't know how to get rid of them politely: I could tell Mom that I don't like them and she should give them to Terry (who would prolly wear them), I could tell her they "don't fit right" but she'd prolly ask to see them on me, or I could toss them into my closet until she forgets about them and I have a huge bag full of stuff to donate to a thrift store. I'll probably opt for the last option because the other ones risk hurting her feelings. 
 Damn, that makes me sound like I'm just too "good." I don't know, maybe it's how I was raised, but I'm supposed to be very appreciative of the fact that she got me something and I'm  supposed  to like it but, when you don't like something, the best possible solution would be to hide it until it's forgotten or wear it a couple times around the person before hiding it until forgotten. For example, for my birthday a couple years ago Dad gave me a $25 shirt from K-Mart that he boxed up really nicely and seemed to have taken time in picking out. Unfortunately, it was a deep purple (eggplant), thick velvety material that I quite simply wasn't going to wear. So, I hung it in my closet until this summer when I stuffed it into a nearly full contractor bag of items to donate to Goodwill; it still had the price tag on it. Ya see, I couldn't wear it because it was really ugly but I couldn't throw it away because it was a gift that was from the heart; I still feel bad that I got rid of it without wearing it, but I couldn't just store it forever (the thought did cross my mind). So, what exactly should I do in those kinds of situations? If I'd taken the shirt back and gotten $25, it wouldn't have been as meaningful and I'd have felt bad. If I'd pitched immediately, I'd have felt bad and he might have easily discovered it missing and inquire about it. So, I stored it for years until I figured he'd forgotten about it. Best possible solution, hopefully. Another example is another shirt I got from Dad from some trip he took to Toronto a few years ago, he brought me a shirt but it was too small for me to wear with dignity at the time. So, I stuffed it into one of my dresser drawers and hoped he wouldn't notice never seeing it. He asked about it a few times and I'd make up some excuse or another, being careful to avoid saying that I didn't like it (not true and would hurt his feelings) or that it didn't fit (true but would make him uncomfortable). So, earlier this summer, when I was cleanin' out my stuff, I came across the shirt and tried it on. Lo and behold, it fit. So, the next day that I knew I was going to be around Dad for a while (the Friday of one of his weekends) I wore the shirt and he commented along the lines of "haven't seen that in a while" knowing he hadn't seen it since he bought it. 
 Oh yeah, back to the shorts, I actually went to ask Mom about going to Wal-Mart for some shorts before I tried on those she got me. She told me that if she saw me actually wearing what she'd gotten me, then she'd "consider it". Well, since I try my best to be optimistic, and I'll keep bugging her about it, I'll hopefully have some new pairs of Wal-Mart shorts before the end of the summer. And, I might have some new shoes tomorrow after our trip to the cheap shoe store in Murfreesboro.
