One moment were just brought into this world by our parents, the next thing that happens is that everybody you love will die one by one... including yourself. Death is a strange thing. Why do we have to die? What is the purpose of all this? Is it all just a state of mind? Are we all not just some illusion or fantasy thought up by someone? In some way though, we are all like dust in the wind. Were here right now, then the next were gone. All these questions may have an answer, answers that we may never know. Death is a mystery. One thing is certain though... we will all go through it.
