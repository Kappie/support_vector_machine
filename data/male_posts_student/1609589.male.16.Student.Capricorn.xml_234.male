Anyway, I saw this ad and almost puked as much as the atkins diet would make you.  Look at that woman that's advertising. How much you wanna bet that she has never been fat or in need of the atkins diet ever? She looked(before her head got cut off in this picture) like the kind of person who would think that Atkins was some kind of makeup brand, and here she is showing off, making fat people sad enough to buy countless books and brand name foods so maybe they could lose weight.  But, guess what? People who would actually gain anything from this diet aren't the only ones who are gonna use it. Oooh no. You've forgotten about the countless masses of non-fat people who seem to think that the world revolves around them, and try to make people sorry for them by throwing away their dignity on talk shows. I'm not talking about anyone in particular, mind you, all i'm trying to say is that some people need to get the fuck over themselves and realize that their petty problems aren't going to get them anywhere.  "oh, they call me names!"  Join the fucking club, okay? EVERYBODY gets called names. E-V-E-R-Y-B-O-D-Y. Noone is left out. It's a part of life. You're too fucking used to being pampered, and the moment someone does something you don't like, you act like the world has done you wrong. Get over yourself.  Now. What have I done since last posting?  X-mas. Good. Got Deus Ex, Tron 2.0, the best 3d card on the market, an electronic drum set, some family get-together game involving remote controls, a subscription to galaxies, and.... clothes. Oh! and the new Bowie album. I like his new stuff better than his old stuff mostly.  I sort of played a joke on my brother.  Somehow my mom got the idea in her head that he likes Dave matthews(when infact he hates him), and i had a brain fart and forgot, so we got him one of his CDs for x-mas.  Then new years. What a crock of shit. My family and I played poker, but then we get to 2004, and everybody parties, even though none of us know what for. It's just another year. It's just because we went around the sun once. Wheee.  Screw 2004. I cheated at poker. When i folded and got 24, i stayed in the game, and WON. That shows how stupid that game is. If you lose you can still win.  I was watching this thing on MTV, the "top 15 top videogame countdown," and i would just like to say right now that all console(some xbox and ps2 players are exempt) players can go fuck off and die right now. Metal Gear Solid 2 was NOT an inspirational game that "changed the surface of gaming." Thief was. System shock was. Doom. Tony Hawk's pro skater.  NBA Slamball 2002 does not count as inspirational to today's games, because a new one comes out EVERY YEAR.  Zelda doesn't count either. Some short kid with a japanese girl's voice ducking under his shield doesn't count as good gameplay. Just because the same 15 second loop is drilled into your head on the NES system does NOT make it a good song.  And dear god, people, Final Fantasy? Not the game so much as 2 things.  1. The name- Squaresoft are complete retards. They seem to not realize that if they had made ACTUAL names for their games, instead of having a FINAL fantasy, then having another FINAL fantasy after the first FINAL fantasy, Square could have been known as the makers of great turn-based RPG games, since the only similarity to the games beside the turn-style and the constant bad character design is that there's always a character names Sid. But noooo, they chose to make me hate them by making me remember their games by rucking NUMBER.  2. The people who play the game- They decide that NON-EXISTANT people are so cool that they decide to dress up like them. At least in star trek they're modeling themselves after actual humans. I guess that the Final Fantasy "house-players" are better because some of them actually LOOK like who they're supposed to be(although there still are some 60 year old women in skin tight tube tops).  I'm done for now.  NOTICE: I still love Blue Man Group. If any bluepies miss me, i'll try to check back on the boards more often. Just IM me to kick my ass back in gear.
