Dear Ryan- do you know what is funny? i spelled Hillary's name the way hilary duff spells hers. thus the absence of one of the "L"'s   Dear Hillary- okay, lets pick out a day where we both are free, because i want to hangout with you really soon. also when do you leave for college?  Dear Reader- Thank you for reading this it makes me feel special. i think. Oreo cookies?   Is your refridgerator running? WELL YOU BETTER CATCH IT!
