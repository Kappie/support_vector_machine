Before we got together I used to tell her that "anything" was a word that I'd use only if I really meant it. I still so. I would do anything to make her feel better.  This entry was almost going to be a complain-about-stress session, but occasion demands otherwise. Well, the occasion doesn't. There's nothing special about today. I'm going to struggle to get up to go to school in the morning. Fail an econs test just after noon and direct an abstract drama piece in the early evening. At about 6 I'll be going over to Fairfield for the Founders day graduation day service. It hasn't really hit me until now, but I'm actually graduating from high school. It's a sad day that brings to a close the happiest days of my life.  I'm very confused about what I should write about tonight. It all seems so important. I really should sit down and write about all my memories in Fairfield some day. But know this reader, I do not wish today to be one of closure. I want it to last. I hope it lasts forever. I would go back and re-live secondary school. Everything. The picture would be incomplete if just a day was missing. The more I think about it the emptier I feel and the more I wanna sit around all day and cry. I think I'm going to cry now.  She doesn't remember what day it is. That's ok. I can understand. She's practical. No point clinging onto the past. I'm sentimental. She's hurt and she's put up a brick wall so that she doesn't get hurt again. It's my fault. Sure it was her fault that this happened too. I do not doubt that. But I'm afraid to tell her that because she'd flare and I'd have messed it all up again. It's true and I sound like a broken record. I tried to make myself feel better but I've just done the opposite.  It's a silly thing- this vow she's sticking to. And I don't even remember consenting to it but I don't think she'd lie to me. She said that she'd never get back with someone who's broken up with her. Today, rationale was provided. Because she doesn't want to be the toy. How do I get her to see?! I feel so helpless. It's like you know with all your heart that it could work, but she won't allow it.  Oh my God. Maybe she doesn't love me anymore.  Happy anniversary Zel. It's been 2 years, 730 days, and I love you like we've only just begun.
