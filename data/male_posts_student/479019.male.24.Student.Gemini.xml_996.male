We're gonna gather... most likely at Godfather's in Tustin. We'll have a nice little get together.  Now playing:  Go Betty Go  - C'mon  Work was good today. Decent tips, which I just spent at Godfathers. Lots of good drinking tonight. Although, I could use some munchies right now.  I need to get Stiff Little Fingers tickets tomorrow afternoon.  ***
