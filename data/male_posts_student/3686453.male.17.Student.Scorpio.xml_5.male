And, I really like some of it.  Plus the fact that I'm turning into a crybaby.  I mean, I like never cry.  And driving home from work, listening to My Immortal then switching to Nobody's Home just... man.  I'm heading for a nervous breakdown or something.  I can't think of any other possible reason.  It's like all my emotions are actually showing themselves occasionally.  Like I was closing windows and thinking about something (a couple people) and I found myself slamming the windows down I was getting so angry.  Actually, just thinking about what I was thinking about then gets me mad... CHANGE SUBJECT!!!  Well, I love my job since the cleaning thing kind of fell through.  Turns out then only needed like 2 people like twice a week to actually clean.  They hired 4 people.  So... I now can work full time in the tech shop there if I want too.  YES!!!  That's actually fun.  So, That's what I've been doing with my work.  I've figured out I have made about $1,500-$1,800 by the end of the summer, at about $200 a week.  I'm looking at this nice Dell laptop, I could get a $1,700 model or a $2,300 model.  Trying to figure out whether to get a cheaper one that I can just buy or make payments on a better one.  I'm hoping that this machine will last me the first 2 years of college, which is why I'm tempted to get the more expensive one.  Had an AWESOME time Saturday, even though I got into MAJOR TROUBLE!!!  I went over to that girls house, let's call her... hmmm.... I'm got three choices... let me see... which would be the least known... yeah.  "ae"  You'd have to know her to get that, and then you'd probably know who I was already, so I'm safe.  Ok.  So, I went to the library to run errands.  I had made it so that we'd "accidentally" bump into each other there.  I almost wasn't able to go because of my mom, but I did some wrangling so I was able to go.  They thought I was going to the video store, K-mart, and the library.  2 hours tops, is what she said she had thought after I gotten home.  I went there, and I didn't even think of getting my books after he started talking.  I got there at 12:30.  The library closed at 3:00.  The librarian told us it was time to go, so since she had left her wallet in her other car I let her use mine.  We both really didn't feel like ending the conversation, so I asked if she knew anywhere we could continue.  Her house was only like 5 minutes away, turns out we live basically just down the road from each other and never knew it.  So, I went over to her place, and stayed until about 8:45.  Had dinner, chatted for what seemed like 10 minutes or so.  Oh My Gosh.  I was in so big trouble, especially since I didn't call, and it was a girl's house.  CRAZY.  Well, I'll talk more later.  Though I really hope she'll be on tonight...
