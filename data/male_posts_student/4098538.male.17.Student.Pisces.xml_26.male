It was a snowy morning and I came out of my door to go to college when I knocked on an old womans door asking her if she wanted to walk me to the bus stop (I have no idea why!). But she did. There were about 12 kids in the drive and as I walked past one I threw a snowball in his face and ran away with the old woman flying behind me! Then I was shouting something like, "You're number 0!" at him. When we got to the bus stop (after lots of slipping on the ice) a massive weird black bus pulled up and out stepped my beautiful girlfriend Amanda! I threw the old chick away (somehow) and ran over to her and asked her what she was doing home and she told me she'd caught the bus from France to come and see me! Wooo! Then... I took her back home and we hid in the kitchen where her friends were calling her and she was like, "Oh I'm still in bed, don't disturb me!". Then I took her into college and she sat next to me. Some guy with long ass hair come into my class with a camera and said to her, "There you are love, we've been looking for you!", took a picture of her and left. Ok. I asked her who he was and she said her other boyfriend, and she just couldn't refuse him 'cause he was 'so sweet'... so kinda confusing. Then someone phoned me (in my dream) as my mum woke me and I was talking to the phone person even when I had woke up. Mad dream! I am really missing Mandy right now. It's unbearable. I have to admit I've cried about 3 times. I only get to speak to her for about 5 minutes a day... it just isn't enough. I should be heading off to college now. UGH. I don't mind it... just hate being up this early for no good reason! It's 8.55am! Have a nice day, whoever reads this...  xx
