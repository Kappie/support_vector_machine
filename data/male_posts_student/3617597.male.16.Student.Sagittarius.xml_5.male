Im listening to a realy old album of mine from bon jovi, i really think that some songs can really make u think about yourself and others aobut you. Just try nextime to listen and see if theres anything aobut your life that you can identify with.  Finding who you are has seemed really important to me inparticular and i think i have helped people with problems that they have had.  As you may not know, im a christian and i have been all my life
