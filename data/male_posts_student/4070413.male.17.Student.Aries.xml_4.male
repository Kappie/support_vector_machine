Be it jealousy or possessive, the root of the cause is always fear. To give too much, the other party will take for granted. To give too little, he will think u don't love him enough. To ask for too much, he will blame u for not respecting him or ask for too much. To ask too little, he will think that u don't concern about him. Too much questioning, he will think that u don't trust him. If the status really causes all this problems, why not we always remain dating? Why not just enjoy each other companion? Whylet those fear manipulate us? Even though we know thats the cause, but we are selfish n choose to proceed with confident. We just see the surface of the problem and avoid it by tolerate n keep pains to ourselves. Do the other party know that we are suffering? Humans do have feeling. When the feelings is beyond our control, when we couldn't hide it anymore. Our tears will start to drop. Some will ask why is this happening to them? some will abuse themselves. Some will drink or smoke. Some will blame others but not themselves. But least will introspect themselves. Theother party may be a flirt or he just couldn't tolerate ur atrocities. We must know how to learn n stop being crazy. The definition of love is too profound. There is no one that can explain every single detail. There is always mystery hiding deep inside. So we cannot assume that we are able to control our love. We are not able to change the fact that we cannot control the other party. We cannot change their mindset, unless they are willing to. If not he will be suffering again. There will always be something to lose. Something really precious
