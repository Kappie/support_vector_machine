Tom Reluctant-Neo-Con Ridge , announced a raise in the terror threat level from lemon to clementine (right?) citing specific information, from multiple sources that New York and New Jersey financial centers were the target of Al Qaeda terrorists that are possibly currently in the United States,(probably watching 'America-hater'   Michael Moore's movies and partying with 'god-hater' George Soros at this very moment.)       Although he says Wall St. is about to E*X*P*L*O*D*E! Sec. Ridge repeats his post-threat announcing mantra of "Go on with your daily lives normally!". Which in    B u s h' s  A m e r i c a   consists of using what little money you have left (after losing your manufacturing job to outsourcing) to buy a $14 throw pillow at Wall*Mart (aiding in the eradication of small business) along with some Duck Brand duct tape to save yourself from biological attack(following Homeland Security's post-9/11 advice. Without knowing that Avon, Ohio-based Duck Brand duct tape makes up 46 percent of the nations duct tape supply.Is it coincidence that the Duck Brand is owned by a man named Jack Kahl, a Bush campaign contributor who gave over $100,000 to Bush's 2000 campaign?). As you exit the Wall*Mart and walk to your $2 per-10-miles SUV, you take a deep breath of de-regulated air and look into the pale blue sky. As you look into that sky you thank God that George Bush proposed the "Clear Skies Initiative", which can finally make the skies clear...of birds. You arrive at your apartment and read the last few e-mails of the day and any feeling of loneliness melts away because you know that your Big Brother Ashcroft was reading those e-mails too. Ah, Bush's America!    YEAH! TAKE THAT OSAMA!  T H E S E  C O L O R S DON'T RUN! THEY CLIMB...THE CORPORATE LADDER!                   Soooo anyways, here are some interesting links pertaining to the recent terror-threats...      This  urlLink New Republic article  that was issued more than  two weeks  before the terror threat was announced discusses the Bush Administration urging Pakistan to capture Al Qaeda related high-value-targets (HVTs) such as Osama Bin Laden BEFORE the November election. Here's an excerpt-              "But The New Republic has learned that Pakistani security officials have been told they must produce HVTs by the election. According to one source in Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), "The Pakistani government is really desperate and wants to flush out bin Laden and his associates after the latest pressures from the U.S. administration to deliver before the [upcoming] U.S. elections." Introducing target dates for Al Qaeda captures is a new twist in U.S.-Pakistani counterterrorism relations--according to a recently departed intelligence official, "no timetable[s]" were discussed in 2002 or 2003--but the November election is apparently bringing a new deadline pressure to the hunt. Another official, this one from the Pakistani Interior Ministry, which is responsible for internal security, explains, "The Musharraf government has a history of rescuing the Bush administration. They now want Musharraf to bail them out when they are facing hard times in the coming elections."           It wasn't until this threat that the mainstream media has questioned whether the Bush Administration has used terror threats for political gain. It's strange how almost every time something goes against the favor of the Bush Administration, they soon announce a raise in threat level from  jungle green  to  fuschia , or from  midnight blue  to the dreaded  macaroni n' cheese ( terror threat levels obviously monopolized by Crayola). The controversial shady terrorist threats are what comedian David Cross sarcastically refers to as "A FUCKING COINCIDENCE!".  Here's New York Times  urlLink editorial piece  on how Homeland Security Sec. Ridge's recent terror announcement at times felt less like a counterterrorism announcement and more like a counter-convention announcement.     "Some of the past terror alerts have seemed aimless and happened when the Bush administration would have benefited from a change in the political conversation. On Sunday, when the administration had grim and specific information to convey, Mr. Ridge did a real disservice to himself, his president and the public by giving what amounted to a campaign pitch for "the president's leadership in the war against terror.'' It's hard to write that off as an offhand comment. If Mr. Ridge is to continue in this role, he must stay out of the election; using him as a campaign surrogate would be disastrous for public confidence. The administration should also stop dropping dark hints about Al Qaeda's having election-related motives to attack, as if a vote against the current president were appeasement."   Hm, what could be against Georgie's favor this time? Hmmm, maybe THE ELECTION ON Nov. 2 WHICH HE WILL MOST LIKELY LOSE! Bush MUST GO!
