Anywyas at the drive in there were so many mexicans there so of course I was smelly the "mary jane" all night long. Man how I wish I had some of that right now. I wish I could get into it. Today I was out caughting bugs for my stupid bio project. It's so gay. I'm getting like an F on it. I know I will. I only got like 16 bugs out of 30. And only 1 week left. Atleast I don't have skool tomorrow. Also on friday my counceler was questioning if I should goto summer skool or not. She better say yes or I will be so pissed.  I saw a great japanese show today even though I forget what it was mostly about. But I do now it was great. The korean show I watch is on tomorrow. Also the one I watch Wed. and Thurs. I think it is ending soon. That will so suck. But a new one will come on. I hope it is just as good.  Just like 1 hour ago I saw this think on nostradamus. It was so crazy. All them predictions were like so close. I wonder what the future holds...
