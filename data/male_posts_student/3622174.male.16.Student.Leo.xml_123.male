I've been working long and hard on a "revenge" system that shall be used whenever any 4 of them (and they know exactly who they are...one may not even step out of line at all, and he knows who he is).  Now, because they're more than likely going to read this blog sometime before camp, I'm not going to give any details about my "revenge" system.  They won't know when to expect any of it...it's just going to happen.  And they can't be prepared...because there's no way possible.  Thank god I'll have my camera this year.    Those who don't know (and should, if they read my profile), I'm going to be going to something called "Camp Orlando," which is a yearbook seminar that's held by my school's yearbook publishing company.  I'm going to be taking a class called "Desktop 5," which will give me some awesome tips for Photoshop (and I have last year's still, so look for my upcoming Photoshop tips on bagel.tech in the near future).  I'll be gone from the 19-22.  Now, you may be wondering.  No Blog of Bagel those days?!  Well, that's wrong.  I will be blogging, through the use of Audioblogger (which I've just started today).  Expect a couple posts per day, and a couple of them won't even have my voice, possibly...can anyone say Candid Blog Post?  Lol.  That should be fun.  And, when I come back on the 22nd, I'll post pictures that I take to go along with the Audio Posts, and then, I leave again on the 23rd, and if I'm blogging through Audioblogger then, then I'll be surprised myself.    But anyway.  Last year, camp was pretty cool...I can remember it all like it was just yesterday, when in fact...it was almost a year ago.  A couple of our female yearbook staffers were in me and Adam's room, just hanging out, and around 2:00 in the morning, someone came knocking on the door.  So, they ran off and hid in the closet, and I hid under the bed.  Yes.  I hid from someone in my own freakin' room.  How stupid was that?  Turns out we're still laughing about it whenever the subject is brought up.  One of the girls (who is no longer on staff), even reminded me in my yearbook where she signed.  Yes, last year's workshop was full of craziness, and this year is going to be twice as bad.  Trust me.  Now, not only will me and Adam be in the same room, but Adam's brother Jonny, Crandall (aka Alex), and Jarred (whom I don't know that well), are going to be there, and they're all the craziest people I think my school has ever had on the yearbook staff.  This year, they're having it at the Sheraton World Resort on I-Drive in Orlando.  It's near Sea World, but, when they give us our "free time," we're going to Islands of Adventure instead.  I'd call Amanda and have her come see me, but, it's probably not such a good idea...too much tension between her and other people on staff.  (Amanda is a girl who recently moved to Orlando from The River, we were good friends).  But, I may be going to Universal later this week, so it would be better to see her then instead of when I go for camp.    Well, anyway, fireworks should be starting soon.  I'm not going.  But, I will be posting an AudioBlog of Bagel post later on tonight, for your enjoyment.  Then, later tonight here on teh bl0gg3r, I'm going to be posting an all new Late Night Bloggin', where I'll take a look at 4 blogs, since I skimped out last night.  Then, tomorrow, everything goes back to normal with bagel.tech, where its Blogger week.  So, stick around for more Blog of Bagel, because I'm going to be either praising or making fun of blogs, so be sure to check it out!  Also, if you don't want your blog to be on Late Night Bloggin', take it off the directory, because, you never know when I could just show up at your blog and do some Late Night Bloggin'.  So, see you later!
