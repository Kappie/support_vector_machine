There is a pack of 80 cents stamps sold at the counter or vending machines in postfixes. When you buy stamps at a vending machine, all the changes are coins, even 1 dollar. I do not want to carry even a few dollar coins so I just leave coins in my car.  Today, I happened to find the coins at lunch time. I did not feel like cooking for lunch so the picture is the result. I drove through Wendy's to have a bacon cheeseburger, medium fries, and small chili. I like this combination. It costs $3.22.  here in america, people like fastfoods very much. At lunch time, people make a long line to order "comb meals". Fastfood is not only main reason for obesity problems, but I think some of the ingredients that really affects people' health must be in this meal, which I suspect is soda.  Coke, diet coke, sprite, whatever carbonated water sold contain awfully lots of sugar. It is not about calorie, or fat. It's the amount of SUGAR. Excising is necessary for diet, but also stop drinking soda.   urlLink    a burger, fries, and chili  urlLink
