Why can't like be easy? And why can't boys be smart, instead of dumb? Why are boys so dumb? That is the unanswerable question. Boys are dumb, let's face it. I mean, think about it. They always want what is right for them, and damn, why do they have to be so protective of there money? God, just open the damn wallet.  Anywho......moving on to today's events. No much happened. I'm glad it was Friday. We watched Charlotte Grey in French. That is the most boring movie you will EVER watch. It moves to slow, and not enough people die. Lol. I know. I'm bad and evil.   Dez and I were talking about 'Why boys are dumb.':  Ben (9:46:51 PM): Why are boys so dumb? Dez (9:46:54 PM): ok   Dez (9:46:56 PM): i dont know   Dez (9:47:30 PM): you're a boy   Ben (9:48:21 PM): Ah yes. But I'm a boy who wants to be a girl (mentally, not physically, lol) Dez (9:48:21 PM): but your not dumb... but dont you know why they are   Dez (9:48:25 PM): yeah   Dez (9:48:45 PM): i dont know... i guess boys just think irrationally becuz of their wieners   Ben (9:49:08 PM): always thinking with there dicks......typical! Dez (9:49:16 PM): yeah!  Why does life suck?
