I haven't seen her for quite a while, and though she says she'll call me soon (quote: "sooner than later"), I know it's probably just forced politeness. I could call her, but I'm sure there'd be something going on. Meh.  The music was great. Sam Druckers General Store. I'll find a link later when I have a little bit more time. I have to leave for work in about 20 minutes, and still haven't eaten breakfast. Anyway. I'm just a little hung over today, and if I can sneak a nap in after work before Kylie calls, I should be ready to tackle another evening. Hurrah!  rawr.
