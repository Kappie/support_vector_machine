The most salient point is the final one - anytime you do something artificial to lower the cost of a good, the supply of that good decreases, creating shortages.  The Nixon price controls created the gas lines.  Anytime you take a fixed supply and discount it, demand increases.  With no economic incentive to provide more, you just get shortages.  Sadly, 99% of Americans don't understand, or don't care to even try to understand, the essence of the system that drives our own economy.  They just want cheap stuff now, regardless of the realities of economics.  You want cheap gas?  Reduce arbitrary environmentally sanctioned blends.  Allow drilling.  Build new refineries.  This is a supply issue, so address the supply!!  We aren't going to 'ration' ourselves to prosperity.    And as for the eventual Hyrdogen economy, bring it on!  I'd be just as happy as the next guy to never need another drop of hydrocarbon, but that day isn't here yet.  So let's get what we need and keep things moving along.
