Today was quite a relax day for me, slept till 11 today as there's no class on sundays.. hehe. woke up, when to had my breakfast plus lunch, can save up by having two meals in one go instead of buying two meals hehe.. Afterwhich, finally got into some sense of clearing up my messy room, after being nag by my parents for sometime, very bad hor. But after doing the clearing up and found out that there's three big bagful of rubbish that has been stacking up all the while, after throwing them away found that my room is much cleaner and nicer to look at. hehe.  After a fruitful day of clearing up, manage to catch some breath watching TV programs on channel u till nw. Boring bit is tomolo morning still have to go to school, somemore is whole day starting from 8 am. Hope that i can manage to wake up on time and not be late.  Well, think that's all for nw folks, to drop me any comments and i'll try to come online to blog everyday to tell u ppl wat interesting life i have that day..  Till Then Cheers. Thomas
