So, I live in apartment, and for the most part I love it.  The massive problem last year was the frat across the way, literally 10 ft. from my bedroom window, loved to play basketball.  Or as I came to call it "Bounce bounce F***!" because every other 10 seconds I would hear two dribbles of a basketball, a clang of the rim and some sort of profanity.    I was increadibly overjoyed to find out the frat house is being torn down.  (PS If you have issues with me calling a "fraternity" a "frat" do the world a favor and depledge from your house by finding out if you're allergic to bullets.)  But, I found out that the frat lifestyle moved below me.    I wasn't awake for this conversation, but I'll relay the story my roomate told me.    Late one Sunday night, my roomate was up late playing videogames in his room when he heard yelling from outside his window.  He sat up in bed, pulled back his curtains and could just barely make out a group of guys calling each other assorted slang terms for gay people.  He decided to go downstairs to get a better view of the proceedings and ran into our rather favorable neighbors downstairs.  After introducing themselves, meathead 1 and 2 began the conversation:  MH1: Hey, if you guys ever have a problem with our music, could you just call us instead of calling the cops.  We had a lot of problems last year with people calling the cops on us. Roommate: Ok MH1:  This is (introduces MH2).  What bars do you go to around here? R:  Murphy's mostly. MH1:  Cool.  If you ever want the hook up, I work at CO's and this guys a manager at Kam's R:  Right, I'll see you guys later  For the record, Kam's is the bar of choice for dudes that like to use ruffies as their pick up line and women who will do anything to be around jocks.  Kam's also has been shut down on various occations for allowing 13 year olds into the bar, and most recently has been closed for encouraging drinking games by rewarding those that drink the most with more free shots.  Classy joint let me tell you.  I made a pact with my roomate at the beginning of Freshman year never to set foot into that place and I'm proud to say neither of us has ever been.  Cut to Thur. night   In between the VMA's and Cubs blowing another lead in St. Louis, at about 9PM Meathead 1 and 2 decided that we wanted to feel their music.  Not just hear, feel.  Our floor began to reverberate and eventhough our TV was at about 3/4 as loud as it could go, we still couldn't hear the TV, less than five feet from our ears.  I decided to give them a half hour of Techno blasting until the cops were called and 3 min. before the self imposed deadline, the thumping mercfully stopped.  I don't want to get into a war of calling the cops on each other with these two because once my roomate gets his half stack working, he'll be loud too, but jesus, techno sucks.  And I can handle loud music, but when you are shaking the entire floor of someone else, its too loud.  Here's another thought to chew on, if you've had problems with the vol. of your music before, take a clue and turn it down.  We'll see how this plays out.
