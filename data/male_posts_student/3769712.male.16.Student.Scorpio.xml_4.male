Seriously, just take 30 seconds to think about the "vastness of space", and then think about the size of the earth and scale to any other planet. We are reltivly small and new. It just "boggoling" to even think. I personlly love astronomy and would love to persue it as a career, but you don't really care, and its okay.                                                   P.S.                                         "Boggoling" don't know if it is a word or not.                                If any of you know what the tittle is then congrat to you.
