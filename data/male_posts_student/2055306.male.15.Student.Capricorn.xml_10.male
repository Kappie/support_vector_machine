He reminded me that while it is always a good thing to have positive character traits (as a leader) such as, charisma, a way with people, love, etc. The one most important thing that one should have, is to be grounded in God. I'm not saying that to be a leader, you need God. Because that's not true. Many leaders, are not christians, and yet they lead, and lead well. What I'm saying, is that as spiritual leaders, we must have a strong relationship with God. Because when we become leaders, we gain followers. And when we gain followers, we cannot only be concerned with our lives, but the lives of others. Which we should anyways. But as a leader, if you make a bad decision, and people follow you, you not only ruin your life, but theirs as well. So, one needs God as a spiritual leader, not only for one's self, but for the people that will follow where you lead.
