It sits on this electrically heated plate, in a glass pitcher sometimes called a carafe.  The handles on the carafes are color coded, orange for decaf and brown for regular, or what fat balding men trying to be original refer to as unleaded and high test, not realizing that Dot or Alice, who has varicose veins and sagging breasts, who nevertheless used to be beautiful once, and when the light shines through the plate glass window that overlooks the parking lot bounces off the table just right, still is, has heard the orange and brown handled carafes referred to in this way every day for the last fifteen years.  The electrically heated plate is called a warmer, but its primary function is to extract flavor from the coffee above it, and replace it with viscosity.   It's always over-bright in these places.  Fluorescents are the first real light to hit your eyes, except for the occasional headlight from a truck with eye level bumpers, in hours. And Dot, I'm sorry, but this is not one of those magical moments when the light bounces just so, making your skin translucent enough to make out the cheerleader inside of you; it's the fluorescents, I decide, highlighting those fabulous chin whiskers that any twelve year old boy would be proud of.  Dot fills my coffee before I'm half done with it, and I think she secretly wants me to finish the pot so she can make a new batch and give herself something to do between now and her three a.m. lunch break.  The cream sits in little stainless steel pitchers, next to Heinz and sometimes, usually south of the Mason-Dixon line, Tabasco, getting dangerously close to room temperature, and when nuggets of coagulated dairy product slip silently into your coffee, you try to convince yourself that you did not see what you know you just saw, and you smile back at Dot.  I watched the cream creep toward uniformity.  And even though I know that if I had started at the same time that the universe started, I would not have succeeded yet, I try to unstir my coffee.
