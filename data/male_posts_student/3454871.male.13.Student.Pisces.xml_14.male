She said she was all pysched because she was having a party and she didn't invite us. I mean, that's just kind of rude. Oh, and now we are referred to as "the old group." What a fucking bitch. Sometime I just wanna strangle that girl silly. She really can be a bitch. And she's got this "wonderful" plan to ditch us for Taylor and them at Six Flags. The first entry in her blog is... I feel really bad for... yada yada yada. I don't believe her. Go to her blog and you'll see what I mean. http://krazykooksblog.blogspot.com. Would you trust her after reading the later posts? No you wouldn't. We aren't re-inviting her to our special olympics today. She can stay home and do all her parents "anniversary" stuff though. Another thing. She told us like two monthes ago she couldn't go to the movie with us because it was her parents' anniversary. She's such a god damn liar. She just needs to be with Taylor and them because she's become on really big ass bitch. I HATE HER! I HATE HER! I HATE HER! I just want our old group: Lizzie, Katlyn, Julie, Melissa, Kristine, Kirsten, and I to be back together. I wanna go back in time and change what Lizzie and Kristine decided. And I wanna go back in time so that I can change what I did to myself. The cutting and the sniffing. I just want to go back in time about two years and fix EVERYTHING! Not even two years. To the beginning of this year. AND KRISTINE, SINCE I KNOW YOU READ THIS, YOU CAN GO TO HELL! YOU ARE NOT SITTING BY ME ON THE BUS TO D.C. GO SIT BY YOUR NEW FRIENDS!  Sorry about the swearing... there are no other words to say all that.
