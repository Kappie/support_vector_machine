We had to wake up at 5 am and we finished around 5:30pm. It was a very long day, but to finish off the day I once again defeated evil and was a hero in  urlLink Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne .   This is the 2nd time I have completed the game on the most difficult mode, Dead On Arrival. So boo yea, I rule. I am also playing  urlLink FarCry . This is by far one of the most difficult games I have ever encountered. The AI is very, well, intelligent, and this makes it much harder to sneak around. I am still waiting for the release of  urlLink Half-Life 2 .  Will this game ever come out?!?  -A guy that is cooler than you.
