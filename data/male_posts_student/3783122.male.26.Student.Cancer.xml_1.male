To eather move back home to California or to stay here where there is nothing out here for me, and lastly to join up with the crew of the Dennis Sullivan. (do a google search and you will find it. Yes its a clipper ship in Milwaukee) See I just dont know what I should do. I tried to talk to my ex-fiance about the whole thing. See we have been appart now for about 9 months. Long story but she is another woman who could not make a commitment. Anyway, She is the only support that I have out here in WI and she lives in Canada. She told me that every time we talk its hard for her and she feels bad for the next few days. She said it's because she hates what she did to me and everytime we talk she is reminded of it. She still has photos up all over her house of us and I suggested that we not talk for a while and she take down the photos so that she can start on the road to recovery. She still is a huge part of my life and like I said my support but I cant. So here wher e the sleepless night came in. I have nothing here so what am I to do? I guess move home and or travel and take a year off of college. So This is the start I guess of a new chapter in my life. Does anyone want 2 wouderful cats? They need a home and they are the best animals I have ever owned.
