I've been trying to figure out what I want in a vehicle - I've been critical of others for buying cars simply for style and so on, so I had to examine what I like in a car. Power I don't really give a shit for - it does at least 140 and that's generally as fast as I'd ever need to go, even in an emergency. Gas mileage is a concern, but so is carrying capacity and height. I want a vehicle that I feel taller in than my little red puddle jumper. I also want space in the rear seats for people with legs. Carrying double amputees is about what my current back seat is for. Four doors are a must, as is a roof rack. A nice sun or moon roof would be great (what the fuck is the difference between the two anyway??)  I looked at the Civic. Everyone's got one, it doesn't have the carrying capacity I want and it's just a little too generic. Also, the temptation to rice it up would be far too great and I'd end up with it a quarter inch off the ground - my vocabulary would be replaced mostly with such stellar examples of english composition as "shit niggah" and "word" and I'd have to drive the fucking thing off a cliff.  I looked at the Golf and the Jetta. While classy cars both, they are a little out of my comfortable price range. A nice TDI with leather would be incredibly efficient on fuel, but smell to high heaven. The trunk on the Jetta only holds a single body, and every time I seem to see a multiple vehicle accident, there seems to be a Golf sandwiched in there somewhere. One of my customers at work swears by them, but by his very words, he swears at them whenever there is something that needs to be repaired. Apparently you need a hoarded sum of Nazi-thefted gold and art when these Wagons-of-the-People(tm 1933 - Das Fuhrer) break down. Just like the Nazis. Fifty years after the war they're still fucking us.  I looked at the Kia Sportage. For about ten seconds. Thought process - "Hey, what about the Sportage? *pause* It's a fucking KIA."  The Honda CRV has gone up in price and down in looks and fuel efficiency since my mom bought one.  Whilst at a film not too long ago (who am I fucking kidding - it's been months since I've been to the god damn theatre - feels like) I noticed (HAH) the ads (puke) for the Toyota Matrix and the Pontiac Vibe. I've always kinda liked the "Sport Wagon" concept - which is rather counter intuitive considering my utter loathing of the station wagons of yore. That particular spur of my psyche might have something to do with the fact that I was driven to a camp as a youth in the back of one. It also may not.  Someone at work drives a bright yellow Mazda Protege5. I think the colour caught my attention. I added it to the portfolio of vehicles I was considering considering based on its "oooooh SHIIIIIIIIINEY" factor. In fact, I think my brain yelled "SHINE GET!" the first time I actually touched it. As I was browsing the Mazda site on "teh intar-web" I noticed that Red and White paint are both free, while Mazda reserves the right to charge $105 Canadian so you can have it in a colour that doesn't suck. (note to self, pick up a jelly wrist rest for keyboard tomorrow) After seeing the Other Two(tm) tonight, my interest in the Protege5 faded.  So I've settled on either the Toyota Matrix or the Pontiac Vibe. There are several interesting aspects to this decision.   Primarily: They are the same car. Toyota builds the underbits and Pontiac buys that, then slaps on their Vibe-ish top bits.  Secondarily: Both of the names are steeped in Dorkitude. First - "No one can be told what the Matrix is..." and all the requisit bullet time bullshit *that* goes along with it. The commercials in the the theatre were decidedly Ghey. Secondly - Vibe? Why not just call it the Pontiac Asspiercing Lubemaster? FUCK!  So my father and I set out in the worst storm to hit the Great Lakes area in at least ten minutes to examine the nature of Das Matrix and The Pontiac Jiggle. The Matrix's uniform colour scheme doesn't work quite as well as the two tone of the Vibe. The Vibe, as I found out upon returning home, is actually the replacement for the Pontiac Aztek, or as it was known by everyone, the Asstek. That particular Detroit mistake was the one with the built in tent in the back - cool idea, but somehow they didn't take into account that the damn thing looked like hammered shit. The Vibe on the other hand is pretty sexy.  I think between the two, the Vibe is the one I'm more interested in. They both share common features in the interior - what appears to be a lot of headroom, a dash mounted shifter, leg room in the rear - a large cargo tray and 60/40 splits rear seats that are backed in plastic. The Vibe is more expensive, however it comes with more standard features. Besides, when it comes to the pontiac, I really like the commercial with the little bobbleheaded dog grooving to the music. If they throw one of those in, I'll buy two.    The three prices involved - $26,812.25 for the Protege5 - $25,490.00 for the Vibe and $24,730.75 for the Matrix. The Pontiac is the best equipped of the lot, with the sunroof and all the trimmins. I think I'm going for a test drive tomorrow.
