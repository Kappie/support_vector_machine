Last night we had a campfire and some kids came down and we partied. Then some batards had to bring alcohol and cigarettes. So in the end someone's cigs got stolen and they were bitching about it and I knew who did but I had said I wouldn't say. So this chick goes off the deep end at me. I almost smacked, lucky for her I'm too beautiful to attack her myself. It's stupid the way people get over their substances. Above all today I have to do her a favour and return the crap she left at the fire. I should just toss it in the lake and forget about it but I'm too damn courteous. Other than this incident the summer has been kick ass. I got my hands back on a bass so I'm enjoying it. See you all at a later date. If any of my pals read this I miss you guys like crazy. If any of my enemies are reading this, punch yourself in the sac or the female pain equivalent. -Slightly Frustrated G I went to bed and didn't see why everday turns out to be a little but more like Bukowski.
