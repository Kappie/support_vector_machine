Then right after that we drove up to SF and watched fireworks.   It was ok, bit foggy though.  My mum's friend came over again and stayed wtih us all weekend, and I have to say after my mum ran through the disneyworld routine like three times, even she was bored.   And as i said, I dont mind the beer.   Well now i kind of do.     6 beers for one weeked and she didn't drink any on saterday, so ALL OF THEM on 4 o july.   D-A-M-N.   Eh, evenly gapped.   But besides my mum who said she quite a while ago(*cough*BULLSHIT*cough*), she was drinkin beer everywhere.     Kindof pissed me off.    And in the morning my mum made me bring her tv out even though I couldn't last week (read last post).     Besides the tv is in full use, still it pissed me off.    And to top it all off, i dont want to be included in anything.....cause whenever i am, she has a stupid laugh.      Oh and never go with her to a movie, she talks throughout everything.      Nother thing that ticked me off is that they wer talking about how a friend keeps telling her what to do and my mom says she shouldn't do that and my mum agrees......really, my mum needs some hearing aids like her friend.     And then they started talking about a car she gave to this one person and i was like damn, how many people do you know???   Really, "I game it to jim cause he's a nice guy, not saying that micheal isn't nice or carren,    but after that incident with John and larry, i couldn't stand Josh with kevin."  Last thing on my list is the worst that might happen.    When we are in disneyworld, mums friend considered coming with us.        NO.  DO NOT WANT HER HERE.    NO NO NO.  NOOOOO.   I can't explain it but NO.   This past weeks been gay.     football and thats about it.   This week seems no change, though since my mums friend went back home, it'll be alot of stuff finally off me mind.
