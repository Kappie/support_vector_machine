Stopped by a few places to shop for a compact heater, i need them to warm my feet from time to time. We went to this small chinese restaurant for lunch, named A1. Karen suggested i eat rice with some egg thingy on top so i ordered them with roast pork. It costs me 7.50 bucks, but it was worth it. The portion was big and oh am i glad to be eating rice again =) It was quite a long walk back, and i was carrying my brand new heater so we decided to "hijack" a tram. We call it "hijack" cause we're gonna go on it without paying. Don't ask why , its just some lame thing we made up. It was scary at first, but it doesnt seem so bad after all. We sat the tram to my place to drop of the luggage and get some rest. Somehow we ended up taking some pictures of the apartment and even a video to send to my parents later on. We locked Karen out on the balcony =P The day was still young, so we thought we should check out the location of our college. With Karen as our tour guide, she brought us on a half an hour walk to the college. We managed to catch a glimpse of the sports facilities on the way. Since we're already out, we then decided to crash Karen's place, just to kill time. We stayed at her shack for a while, enjoying a cup of lemonade while checking out some "interesting" magazines *Nyek nyek* We also watched a tape of.... South Park! ( OMG they killed Kenny! You bastards!!! ) We felt tired after that so we hijacked another tram back home. Kafaii got seperated cause he geniusly ran across the road and into the tram without waiting for us. The rest of us couldn't cross. There were cars. Bye kafaii! Luckily he didn't get lost hehe. It was only our second time hijacking a tram. Had a 2 hour nap ZZZZZZ and then it was dinner time. Went out for fastfood again, this time its Nando's. The price was not too bad , at 5.95, but the chicken was freakinnn smalll!!! The side dishes was in a quite big portion though, but it wasn't enough. We went back to kafaii's place for a cup of instant noodles. We're staying overnight cause kafaii and lipzhun's gonna watch Euro 2004 Finals next door....while i sleep =D
