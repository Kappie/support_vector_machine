Then of course, i don bear grudge easily, and besides, saying sorry is difficult, so ya lor, no more tension again. Then after that lessons all the way...got A.maths test, not that bad la...but then i draw finish graph then saw the question got error, then sian halfway, no more time some more. Then later all those slack lessons lor...then after school actually wan go bowling with justin they all, but then figured out Os coming, studies more important, so i went home. then as usual...eat, slp, study. That about sums it all for a boring tuesday, for now...back to study.
