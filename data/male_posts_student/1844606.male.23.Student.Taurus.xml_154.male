IF IT WEREN'T FOR BLACK SABBATH, I'D HAVE NO REASON TO LIVE!  OF COURSE I WILL BUY WHATEVER JOSH OR NICK PUT OUT, BUT THIS REALLY BLOWS!  Let me know if you find out anything about upcoming QOTSA-related albums. Peace out,  One seriously pissed-off Queens of the Stone Age fan   I love that my friends are really into music.
