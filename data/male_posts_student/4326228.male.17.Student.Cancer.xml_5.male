Try not to be as excessive as you'd like to be, though. This mood will last for a few more days. Mete it out carefully." So wrong...  I feel like shit, got hardly any sleep last night and to top it off I walked strait into my door when I went to go take a shower to wake up.  The shower was great as all showers are  but now I have to go pick up my licence  and then register at school.  Arg I know both things require a picture but right now I'm not in the mood at all to fucking look nice.  In fact when I'm done with all this stuff Maybe Ill just come home and sleep for ever.  Or untill I find something more worth my time.  My mother and I were talking again about school.   Some things she said to me, " Your starting to grow alot, your looking like a true man or some shit like that"  Yes mom very flattering and all but it was great how you pulled the join some military branch bullshit on me, it will be better for your life.  FUCK I KNOW THE MILITARY WOULD HELP ME OUT ALOT BUT FUCK THE MILILTARY!   I mean FUCK!!!  I have uncles who cry and scream in their sleep becuase of shit that went on in the war.  Pretty bad when like all the men in my family have killed someone.  BWAHAHAH.  Well excpet for my uncle bobby but he was a drug dealer so it doesnt matter.   I'm not saying I would get put in war, front line and have to kill someone for sure if I joined the military its the reasons we go to war.   I would sure as hell shoot back if some country came into united states and was trying to kill every one.  But I don't plan on going somewhere eles to do it, I'm to lazy I guess. Plus I dont like having to be yelled at non-stop to keep me in line.  It would drive me to the point where I would have to kill some of  "my own people" to get the fuck out of there.    I could type about this for a while, what eles is on my mind.  OYEAH! my sister,  hrmm well lets just say if things keep up the way things are going with her she will have a hard time working at a gas station and from staying homeless.  She is going to be going to CV this year with me so maybe I can umm sort of guide her but Ill have to show a good example and I hate going to class as well.  My mother wants me to go to registration with her tomorrow, Help her through all that shit and I said I would.  Infact I want to help her cause seroiusly,  she has no life at the rate she is going unless she becomes a slut for some really old guy with lots of money.   Well I'm off  to go school, wonder who I will see today.
