I skipped the early morning service today because i was plumb tuckered out of it - so i stayed @ home and worshipped my pillow for two extra hours.  I hope God isn't going to hold that against me :P  On Tuesday i have a humanities test that i lost my review sheet to - must ask roomate to borrow his.  This blog is seeming to go well, i've had more hits than i thought i would in like 2 months - yeah!! Now i'm sitting in church and a song by Rebecca St Jamesis being played, "I thank you . . ."  in remeberance for all of those who have paid the dearest cost to give us our freedom - their own lives.  How thankless i am, i find myself casting doubt and negativity toward those who are trying to make this world a better place -  America the Beautiful, what an awesome song.  it's too bad that the only time people feel like singing these and other patriotic songs is in a church somewhere .  .   . I bet you their are people out there who don't even know the words to America the Beautiful.  Imagine standing looking at the Rockies - "For purple mountains majesties;"  or the great plains of oklahoma and those states - "across the fruited plains" - the whole image of the song is lost on sooo many people.  The sheer reliance on God is evident throughout the next three verses - look it up, it's true.  A land that boasts in God we trust is shutting Him out at every turn. And the words on the tablet of the statue of liberty - give us your poor, beleagured . . . - we cast them out also.  Embrace the unloved, show them that someone still cares - i saw pictures of little arabian children, innocent . . . if we don't reach to them they will reach @ us but with weapons.  God's love is unmatchless and unending - He died for them as well as for you - today i'll end with words from my favorite song:    I'm proud to be an American where at least i know i'm free.  I won'ot forget the men who died to give this life to me; and i'll gladly stand up, next to you, defend her still today 'cause there ain't no doubt i love this land God bless  the USA.  Peace people i'll be onlater to talk more about the 4th
