There's latest CD is self-titled, Blink 182, and I think it's their best album yet! Even though it has a different sound to it from any of their other songs.  Definitely go check out this album if you like punk! Highly recommended. Also, check out the rest of 'em...they all rock ;)   urlLink Buy there stuff here!
