We ran around looking for an empty practice room but there were none. So we ended up just opening up Chelsea's trunk and practicing in there as everyone walked by staring. So when we were done we went back in the band room while eating our "New York BlueBerry CheeseCake Ice Cream." So when we get back in the band room we decide to take Sadia over to Chelsea's house to watch Blue Devils and Phantom Regiment. Sadia had never seen drum corps before so it was really fun watching her jaw drop. We then realized that we had to be somewhere in like 5 min so we rushed down to the music room and we ended up not even playing because our "dum major" didnt get his facts straight and go to a second source for correct dates. So i just ended up playing some excercises on the sousophone. But then me Chels, Sadia, and Raja decided to go to McDonalds without actually telling Raja that he was going to pay for all of us but its ok cause were going to pay him back. We went back to Chelsea's house and long and behold we watch more drum corps so that we could show Raja what it was all about. We pretty much summed it in in a phrase pertaining to "A marching band on crack." so he was all shocked and Sadia got even more excited. She wants copies of all the cd's and dvd's now and shes really excited for sun. our first b corps meeting. it was really fun and there's going to be about 10 excited faces at Chels house on fri i cant wait.
