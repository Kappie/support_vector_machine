Yesterday, we spent the afternoon and night together... We were at El Centro and we just went from one place to another one without a schedule. I felt great, we were relaxed, talking, been us. Now, as I said before: in the matters of two, I could only speak for myself, so. It was great for me. There was no pressure to do something, there was no need to fulfill time. At one point, we were going to the movies and they were too late so we sat in the parking lot talking... It was a nice way of spending a Sunday afternoon with someone you care.  I spent the night with him at his place of work. And I thought, maybe, we could get bored there, just staring at each other. Au Contraire. We had a nice chat... He was tired, I wasn't that much... Still, was a great night. A great conversation. And I found myself feeling a little chicken when it came to say what I felt... I'm more of a writer. SO I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, FOR YOU TO READ: I LOVE YOU. Did you see how more relaxed I was being friendly in public?... I just didn't care what everyone thought, I did care of a nice beating, but heck, what is one to do in those cases?
