But the good thing is tt I've plan for the next two days. L0L!  For tmr, I'll be going out wif Benson to make his new I.C. Apparently, he left his I.C at a lan shop and 4got to take it back after he was done playing. Haha, I told him to go back to the lan shop to try his luck, but he didn't want to. Tt's y tmr I'm going wif him to make his I.C. After tt, we'll probably be heading down to Queensway shopping centre as I wan to buy a pair of shoes. Haha, so nice of him to accompany me rite? L0L! At nite, I'll be busy watchin Euro 04. The first match tt kicks off the tournament is Portugal against Greece. I'm supporting Portugal all the way and I noe tt they are going to defeat Greece. It's quite obvious tt Greece stand no chance at all. Haha.  On Sunday, I'll be going to gamble and hopefully earn some money to put them in my new piggy bank. Hehe, but at nite I'll be back to watch the Euro 04 match between England and France I think. Well, I'm pretty sure France is going to win, but let's juz hope tt they flop. I dun even wan them to qualify pass the grp stage. Haha, but they haf a strong team and wif Zidane around, nothing can go wrong. L0L! Well, as for England, I noe tt they're going to flop the tournament like they always do. L0L!  I decided to cum up wif my own music chart too. It's juz to keep me occupied, but I dun even noe if it would daily, weekly or monthly. Haha, most probably when I like it and haf nth betta to do. L0L! These are basically the songs tt I've listening to, most of them are pretty old, but there are some new ones. Haha, so here goes...  Shawno's Music Chart: 10. Kimberley Locke - 8th World Wonder 9. Ronan Keating - She Believes In Me 8. Kurt Nielsen - She's So High 7. Atomic Kittens - Cradle 6. Bob Guiney - Girlfriend 5. Maroon 5 - This Love 4. ATC - Mistake No. 2 3. Guy Sebastian - Angels Brought Me Here 2. Kci  JoJo - All My Life #1. Kelly Clarkson - Beautiful Disaster  Yeap! So tt's about it for today. Hehe, I'll cya around ya? =]
