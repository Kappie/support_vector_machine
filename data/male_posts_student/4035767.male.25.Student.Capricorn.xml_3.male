To bolster his claim that organic foods were no safer than other kinds of foods, Stossel cited pesticide residue tests he claimed ABC conducted.  Later, he learned that the pesticide tests were not conducted (the tests were for bacteria, not pesticides).  Like most of the errors in journalism, the mistake was innocent.  Soon after discovering his oversight, Stossel retracted the statement with apology, and he still regrets the error.    Despite his admission and apology, leftist special interest groups swarmed to attack Stossel.  A spokesperson for the “Environmental Working Group” said, “Stossel lied and threatened an entire industry by disseminating false and damaging information.”  Many activists even demanded that Stossel be fired.  Some argued that the activists had been simply longing for the opportunity to demand the head of their Emmy-winning ideological opponent.  Others said they were merely performing the noble task of keeping the mainstream media honest.    Assuming the latter was the true motivation, it is curious that such truth crusaders are conspicuously silent with respect to Michael Moore’s film, “Fahrenheit 9/11.”  The errors, distortions and lies in Moore's film have been  urlLink thoroughly chronicled   urlLink elsewhere , so there is no need to recap them here.    The left called for Stossel's head because he said "pesticide" instead of "bacteria."  And the loudest, most obnoxious charge the left makes against President Bush is that he "lied" about Iraq (actually, the    most    obnoxious is the "war for oil" kookery).  So it is interesting to note that no person of importance on the left has even called for a retraction from Moore.  He'll even be speaking with some prominent Democrats (including Howard Dean) at a rally in Boston this week.  Responsible journalists admit error and immediately retract untrue statements, usually with apology.  Similarly, intellectually honest people recognize error even when it exists on their side of the aisle.  Instead of setting up "war rooms" and threatening detractors with lawsuits, Moore should apologize and retract his error-filled film.  Similarly, responsible Democrats should demand it from him.
