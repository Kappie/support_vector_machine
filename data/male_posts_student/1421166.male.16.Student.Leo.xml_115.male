Although at this point in time, I shouldn't be talking about recreation, I have two chinese essays to complete and here I am typing away at 9.30pm. Argh...can't get into the mood of doing work, well at least it's just Chinese work I guess. I think I really need to put down band life soon so I can finish up my work and revision in school. My home makes me want to sleep or whatever activity besides doing work.  Hmm...I'm form 9!!! Vampire eh...not my idea of me. Haha...oh well, hoping I'll get something that is more of hope and light and something angelic perhaps. But turn out that is dark and blood drowned. Makes out that I'm a blood sucker. Even Sherlyn got something like Phoenix. Maybe mine will turn out a better form if I didn't say that I feel lonely at times even when I know that there are people who love me. Anything, don't even really understand the description for my results anyway.
