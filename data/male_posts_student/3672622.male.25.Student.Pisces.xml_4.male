Talking about love through these medium is probably overkill to the avid reader.  However, love is the drive of someone's life and all the world revolves around their love or lack there of.  Which brings me to what may cause an aneurysm later on in life.  A little background: I am a nice guy, some assholes claim this title and are unable to back it up, hence the common quote, "He was so nice at first", anyway I was the friend that every girl claimed they wanted to marry, eventually.  Now that I am attending a four year university, I truly believed being the nice guy would begin paying off by Kharma's standards alone.  I have had girlfriends, all of which I have settled for.  Not that they weren't nice girls or pretty, but I am a helpless romantic that has a vision of who I want.  Not by the characteristics of blonde, tall, tan, or things of that nature.  I want a girl that thinks for herself and has ambitions in life.  I want the girl that will go play in the rain, lay in bed all day and talk even though the sun is shining, likes herself the way she is(little if no make-up and never even considered plastic surgery), loves the beauty of nature and is ok with no TV.  I could go on, but I thought I found the girl.(Keyword:thought)  She was my best friend and the one I confided in the most.  I confused the friendship we had with deeper feelings on account of the love you have for a best friend.  I was ready to give up on the girls in this region of the world, until an interest popped up in an unexpected place.  She was an ex-girlfriend's little sister in her sorority(normally don't like the breed but there are exceptions to every rule).  We will call her Maria, and I am not so bold to say I am in love or even in that state of mind, but I enjoy getting know everything about her.  She is real to herself at all times in any company, which is unfortunately all to rare now days.  Her ability to care for others is almost overwhelming, and leaves you breathless at times.  She thinks no one understands her.  My new name shall be "NO ONE", for I am the friend that takes care of all, offering myself and all that I have to anyone who asks.  This is the most fulfilling way of life to me, but it has its burns that come with it.  There is the taking advantage angle, but I am getting more from helping them than they are from me.  Its when the few days out of the year that you shed optimism and have the shitty days.  Where is everyone?  I could use someone to vent to. Guys, where are you?   No need to be bitter, but it hurts the heart, which is what guides me through life.  I like this Maria, she is special, unique in spirit and is all to beautiful(definition: pretty, funny, intelligent, outgoing), you know BEAUTIFUL.  That word is used all too much and most don't deserve it.  I don't care if anything comes from it, it would be nice.  She is one of the people you meet on your path in life and are a better person because of them.  I said it, she makes me want to be a better person.   This was all too long but it's my first time.
