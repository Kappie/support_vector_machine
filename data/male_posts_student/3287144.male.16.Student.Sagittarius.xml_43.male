Anyway not much to mention other than I had a rather interesting dream last night; I sit with a few friends on a bench next to a man; the man is of 60 years of age and is very thin, his clothes hang off his frail body and his skin is unnaturally white. While I am sat next to him I am conscious that he is evil and planning on stealing something off me so I try to get up and move away except I can't. Stuck fast I wait and eventually he gets up and I stand up at the same time, he then goes to embrace me and I reach to protect him from stealing my watch, I hold on tightly to it so that eventually he realises he can't get it and subsequently walks off. I then realise that he was Father Time. Looks like this was just a short one. Again.
