Take a look at this concotion:   Take one Packard Bell PC from a highstreet computing store, PC World for example. Mix in a generous helping of preloaded adverts, trial versions of software and ISP demos. Add in Kazaa Media Desktop and stir for 5 minutes. Introduce an AOL subscription and sprinkle with multiple antivirus software. Don't update your drivers, that will spoil the taste. Let it brew for a few months then serve piping hot.   But seriously, it frustrates me immensely to see endless families hoodwinked into buying PCs from highstreet shops which are loaded with crap from the word go. They put on AOL and Kazaa and then they whine when it all screws up.  I went round to a mate's house yesterday because he mentioned that Halo wasn't running so well. The PC spec was excellent, but it just wasn't playing as good as it should. Guess what it was though - a  Time  computer filled with AOL, Kazaa and loads of random antivirus and adware stuff! I'm sure I could charge people to clean up their PCs. Now there's an idea...  Now I remember my resolution - not to be lazy. So here I am, sitting in Computing, not doing an impossible Visual Basic task set by some pompous director of Somethingorother Education Board. The worksheet in front of me demands that I get on with my work so until next time, stay safe and watch out for those  urlLink AOL CDs .
