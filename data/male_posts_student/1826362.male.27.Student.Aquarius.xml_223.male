I don't think that the film told me anything I hadn't really heard before, but it did put it all in front of me again, and made all the anger and outrage fresh again.   I want to boycott something. I want to protest something. I want another system. I want voting reform. I want intelligent and compassionate people in office. I want my rights to be observed. I want an alternative.   somebody organize me.
