After getting about 3 hours of sleep the past three days, I headed home for a restful night of sleep. First off, today is "Stop Day." There are no classes today to give students time to study for finals next week (yeah, right). Any smart person would suddenly realize that everyone goes out and gets plastered the night before and spends a hungover day at home. Not wanting to fight the crowds and save some money, Squeak goes to bed early, about 10:30. Two hours later, the calls begin.   Call #1: 12:39 AM CST. Caller: Mike Bonomo  The phone rings and Squeak sees that it is one of his buddies who lives in Kansas City. He picks it up and is greeted by a loud crowd in the background. "Dude, next time to come up we gotta go to this place, you'll love it," Bonomo says.  "Why?" Squeak asks. "It's a piece-of-shit hole in the wall and I just got a shot of tequila for 75 cents," Bonomo yells back.   WTF? You called me at 1:00 in the morning to tell me about this shit? Squeak hangs up and goes back to sleep.  Call #2: 12:59 AM CST. Caller: "Mrs. B-KU in training"  The phone rings and Squeak immediatley knows it is "Mrs. B-KU-IT", due to the ringtone.  He picks it up and answers it.   "Hey, whatcha doin,?" Mrs. B-KU-IT asks. "Uh, sleeping," Squeak replies.  "Well, I am so f*cking drunk right now. I had 5 Bahama Mamas and a shot. I am so drunk. This is the real _________ (Mrs. B-KU-IT says her name)," she says.   WTF? Suddenly, Squeak sits up in bed. "What do you mean by the REAL _________?" Squeak asks.  "Well, I figure you've never really seen me this wasted before," she says.  "So, what you're trying to say is that you're an alcoholic?" squeak asks.  "No, well, it's just I like to party and alot of people think I'm a goody two shoes," she says.  Squeak realizes that Mrs. B-KU-IT is trying to impress Squeak. Squeak realizes that Mrs. B-KU-IT is not drunk, she is annihilated. Mrs. B-KU-IT hands off the phone to her drunk roomate. Squeak converses with the drunk roomte for a matter of two seconds. After some small talk, Squeak terminates the call and goes back to sleep.   Call #3: 1:59 AM CST. Caller: Carlos Mashek.   Carlos is one of Squeak's J-school buddies. Squeak answers the phone.  "Hey, **** face! I thought you were going to come out and get wasted tonight. YTou're a ******* faggot!," Carlos yells.  Squeak immediatley terminates the call and throws his cell phone against the wall and goes back to sleep. Stupid college kids.
