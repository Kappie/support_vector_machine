Band camp has kinda sucked in previous years, especially my freshman year. I remember one night were I sat out by the tennis court and fucking cried. Like a little three year old. I dont really know why. Some combination of me feeling sorry for myself and feeling angry about being a fatass... whatever. This year is going to be better. In the previous two years, carrying the drums has been, simply put, a complete and utter bitch. First year, I wasnt in any sort of physical condition to carry the farely huge bass I got stuck with (for all you Kevin-newbs, I'm in drumline: first year I played bass, second year quints (tenors? multi-toms? whatever), and this year I'm on snare. The second year, (with quints) I was stuck with the heaviest set of tenors, which means that I was carrying the heaviest drums in the line ... which is actually arguable because of the way weight is distributed over the harness. However, this year I'm on snare and am confident that I could walk as far with the snare as without it. yay. good times.
