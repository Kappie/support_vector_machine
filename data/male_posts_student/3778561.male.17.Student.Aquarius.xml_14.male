I then went on a totally random bike ride where I met up with Adam and Jo. Then we wnt to Needs and I got a Gatorade and Turtles and then Tom came. SO about 10 miniuts later sadly Jo had to leave to go back to Corner Brook. So Adam, Tom and Myself stayed around talking for awhile and then Adam left and me and Tom went to Justins and we seen Duncan and also when we got there Jason W was there. After leaving there we proceeded onto some more "Botiques" that can be found around town and also stopped in for some Subway yum, yum, yum. Well that about all that I have did so far today  but theres still alot of day left yet who knows what I will do! Well thats all I have to say for now. Until next post.
