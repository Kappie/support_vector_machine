Pi Day Competition tomorrow too.  I glad the Math Club ordered  vomit  colored shirts.  Checkmark in the Tasteless Articles of Mathematical-Related Clothing category.  I am also glad that pool deck was approx.  900 degrees  today. It was like a friggen' Swedish sauna in there.  Not to mention the fact that one could probably poach an egg in the water.  Checkmark in the Ridiculously Warm Recreational Bodies of Water category.  Glad we got that covered.  In other news, my "taking the liberty of being a spy for my friends" has taken a turn for the worse.  I think Meg and Herc are catching on.  "Why?" you ask? Well today I saw them together and  both  of them gave me the.... evil eye .  On the television front, there is gonna be a new  CSI  spinoff.  It will be CSI: New York.  Should be good.  Although no one can beat William Peterson as "Gil Grissom".  Oh, and before I go, Jennifer Garner (of  Alias ) made a recruitment video for the real CIA.  It is the most inspirational thing I have seen.  I loved it.  The part that really lets you know that Jen is patriotic is the fact that she wasn't paid a  cent  to make it.  That is truly awesome!  I love her.  Anyway, gotta start up the oven for dinner. Catch y'all later.
