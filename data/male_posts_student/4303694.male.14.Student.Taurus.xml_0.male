So I went and got Gloria then we walked to Kris' and I went inside and then I remembered I had forgotten my I.D. card ( I totally didn't feel like getting in trouble for something so stupid) So I ran home and got the DAMN thing but by then I was all hot and sweaty. Then I had to walk to school and got even more sweatier. So when I got to school I headed for the nearest potty and freshened up. I looke din the mirror I realized that all that sweat had messed up my bangs ( which by now were curly) So I ended up not being able to fix it till about fourth period. During school it was okay I talked to Bret and I also said "Hi" to Hector. Then after school The twins Angie and Lacey and Cynthia and my home girl Rachel and I went to Kris' to hang ( Because band didn't start til' abuot6:15 P.M.) So we hung out then we left at about 5:15 for my house and I changed into another set of clothes and My friends had never seen my house and they were all like "Erik you're so rich!" It really showed me how lucky I was. So now I realize that I should treat my mom better. Well then we went to band pracitce and got there early so we hung around. I said "Hi" to one of my old friend Jason who I hadn't seen in like four years. So during practice I saw Joesph Vase waved at him. Oh yeah and I saw George Stock, He actually said hi to me and i in turned said "hey"   After Practice I went to go and eat Sloppy Joes ( Which are so TASTY!!) Then I got home and called TYler Cortez. (Who I had heard messed around with the already comitted to Edward Gloria.) VERY BAD GLORIA!!!! Well then I called the oh so HOT Nathan. Who was doing homework and said he'd call later as IF! Well then I called my grand mother to see if my cousin had started school at my school yet. Turns out he went for a while then got tooken out for a physical ( Totally gross having an old guy touch your body.) Well I said that I hd told my friends another one of my cousin would be joining me at school. So now it's:   Margaret, Brittney, Eugene, Chris, GIlbert, Adam, Adrian( The latest0 and my brother. So then I said I have to many cousins that I don't even know. So that's why I stick to the white folks for BF's because I know that I don't have many cousin of that race ( Oh dear I do hope I don't sound dreadfully racist cuase I'm really not!) Well My grandmother said "Well Adam is white" And I said "I really don't talk to him much" And she said don't be rude and I go I am not! ( FOR thoese of ya'll that know me know that if you say Hi I WILL say hi back. But Adam doesn't like me so ADAM "F**K you!" I guess that's all I am much to tired.   Chow for now   much love   folks!!   Kinky Green   AKA   erik
