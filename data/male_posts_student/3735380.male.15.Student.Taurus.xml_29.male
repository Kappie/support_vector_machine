My twelve-year-old brother always thinks he's muscular, cool, and über alles just because he wears his pants halfway his thighs, blasts rap music everywhere he goes, plays basketball, and uses every foul word invented—including the ones in sign language. He's only halfway cool and still attempts it, which makes him a wannabe.  This conflicts with my interests. My interests are more computerized. I like technology, programming, and graphic design. These interests are always the target of the belligerent "cool" person, so he tries to score extra points by picking on his older brother. Real smart.  This morning he woke me up by the sound effects of  the computer, at full blast.  The rest of the day followed, and this was the most intense non-physical fighting we've ever done. Insults, threats, and cuss words were flying like grains of dirt in the Dust Bowl. This lasted about two hours.  I only fought back to defend. What is his mental diagnosis? He thinks he can be cool by picking fights.  Later that night, I started doing some roleplaying games. Those are fun online, and you make a story in a co-op mode.  I talked to my girlfriend again on AIM.  It was a mellow conversation, but we did find out about each other's more recent lives.
