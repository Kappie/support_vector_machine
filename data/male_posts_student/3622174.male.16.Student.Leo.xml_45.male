The new search function is now available, and allows you to search for stuff that I've posted without digging through the archives.  The search is updated at 6:00 p.m. every day, so you should be able to find everything.    By the way, how do you like the new skin?  I decided to go with something a little lighter on the graphics side, to avoid long loading times for our 56K users.  Hope you like it.  Tomorrow, I'm going to continue working on the site by tweaking some minor things.  Nothing else major is going to be worked on, however.  Most of the site's construction is officially done.    Beginning Monday, be ready for some sweet new posts.  I'm going to teach you how you can change the look of Windows XP, for those who didn't know, with the download of the day, Style XP.  Other stuff, I haven't thought of yet, but, you'll find out on Monday.  Anyway, look through the archives or do a search if you're looking for something, and be back Monday.
