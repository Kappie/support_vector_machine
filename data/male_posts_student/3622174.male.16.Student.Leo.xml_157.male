This may or may not be a daily thing, I'm not sure, but, if it is, then expect everything that I talk about to be completely...well, random.  Normally, I'll just talk about things that are going on that don't deserve their own post, and maybe talk about stuff that I like.  But, whatever happens, keep in mind that its random, and probably not well written.  Now, enjoy.    School is Changing  I was up at school today, and I must say, there is A LOT that is changing around TRHS lately.  I now know every detail of my schedule.  1st Semester: Period 1: Spanish 2 Period 2: Exec. Intern/Guidance Period 3: Yearbook/Mass Media I Period 4: Economics/American Gov.  2nd Semester: Period 1: English IV (I got the baseball coach again) Period 2: Algebra 2 Period 3: Yearbook/Mass Media II Period 4: Exec. Intern/Guidance  It's going to be quite a year.  Yearbook is going to be a huge change this year.  We're switching from Pagemaker software to the much-better InDesign, which combines elements of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Pagemaker, all in one sweet package, which will allow for better layouts.  I tried playing with it today, and it's going to be interesting, learning how to use it.  And we're going to have to work at it, but, in the end, we're going to create a Yearbook that it 50x better than last year's.  I know it.  I can feel it.   It feels so weird, knowing that in less than a week, school will have started again, and this time, it's the last time I'll ever have to deal with the rush of the whole "first day of school" thing before college.  College.  Holy crap.  One year from now, I'll be moving out to college.  THAT feels even weirder.  I got my locker today, and I'll be at the school for pretty much the rest of the week, working senior pictures and selling yearbooks and stuff.  Turns out I'm NOT going to be creating the video for orientation after all... some other kid that I know is working on it.  Good thing, too, because I'm too caught up in yearbook preparations that I don't really have the time to do it.    Back to the Future  Anyone else a huge fan of these three movies?  Yeah, being 17 years old, you'd think that I wouldn't be watching them like I used to.  But, they're my favorite movies of all time, I think.  I finally found a copy of the DVD Trilogy Set, and I'm very impressed.  It's in widescreen, but, the special features make up for it.  The quality of the movies overall has definitely improved-- the picture looks so much better.  Here's a rundown of each movie, just in case you've never seen them:   Back to the Future  The first installment of this new trilogy by Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis was released in 1985.  Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the stars of the whole trilogy, and their characters are defined perfectly in this first installment.  In 1985, Doctor Emmett Brown finishes his work on the DeLorean time machine.  After being attacked by Libya terrorists, Dr. Brown is shot, leaving Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) flying through the speed of time into the year 1955.  Somehow, he must try to get back to the year 1985, and he has no more power in the flux capacitor to get him back.  So, he must team up with the 1955 version of Dr. Brown to figure out a way to get back, without interfering with history.  But, Marty did not realize this, and he had met his pushover father, when he was a teenager.  Biff Tannen, who hates the McFly family, is always trying to beat up on Marty's future father, and also trying to get Lorraine (who would later become known as Marty's mother) to have sex with him or something.  Not quite sure what his intentions were.  Anyway, Marty has to try and hook up his future father and Lorraine for the upcoming school dance, because, if his parents don't meet, then he will never be born, therefore screwing up the time continuum and sending Marty into a state of non-existance.  He is successful in doing so, as Marty's father beats up Biff and gets Lorraine to like him.  Then, at the end, Dr. Brown has to make it so that the DeLorean is struck by lightning at a speed of 88 mph, in order to get Marty back to 1985.  They're successful, and then, the movie goes back to 1985, and Marty's warning to Dr. Brown about him getting shot works, as Dr. Brown is wearing a bulletproof vest now when he gets shot.  Then, it says To be Continued.   Back to the Future II  The second installment of the series first takes us to the future, the year 2015 to be exact.  Cars are flying, and things are different, and potentially bad for Marty McFly's family.  Dr. Brown must get Marty to dress up as his future son and prevent Griff (a relative of Biff), from getting Marty's son to do something bad and end up in jail.  Then, a big blow for Marty comes as he gets fired from his job in the year 2015, because of an inside business deal.  Then, they go back to 1985.  Things are different in Hill Valley.  In 2015, Marty had bought a sports almanac for the years 1950-2000, so that he could make some extra money when he goes back to the year 1985.  Dr. Brown made Marty throw it away, and Biff gets a hold of it, and also steals the DeLorean to go back and give the 1955 version of Biff the almanac.  Now, in 1985, Biff controls all of Hill Valley, and even beyond.  So, it's back to 1955 for Marty as he must retrieve the almanac from ever getting in the possession of Biff.  The cool thing about this movie is that it takes scenes from the first movie and gives them a whole new perspective.  Will Marty retrieve the almanac?  You'll have to watch it to find out!  At the end of this movie, the 1985 Dr. Brown is accidentally sent to 1855, and now, Marty has to go find him.   Back to the Future III  The final movie in the BttF trilogy goes to the old west, in the year 1855, where Marty McFly must stop Dr. Brown from wanting to live in the old west, and get him back to his time period in 1985.  The DeLorean goes back to the west, is nearly attacked by Indians, and Marty locates Dr. Brown.  Biff's relative from that time period (can't remember his name, sorry), is being the usual asshole towards the McFly family, and eventually threatens to kill Marty.  Dr. Brown meets the woman of his life, Clara, and doesn't want to leave the old west.  This one isn't the best one in the series (that title goes to II), but, it's still a pretty good movie.  I haven't fully finished this one, so I can't give complete details yet, but, I'll finish it up later.  That's it for today's Random Ramble.  I'll be back later tonight for the return of Late Night Bloggin', and maybe something else, too.  See ya!
