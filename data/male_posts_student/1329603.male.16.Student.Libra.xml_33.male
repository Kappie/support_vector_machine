I got Buzz a birthday card with some of the money I got for my paper round, £5 is going towards Suz's present and the quid or so I had left is mine, all mine. I spent some on getting a small Galaxy bar (and mum gave me £1 to get a coke on condition I gave her a pound's worth of coppers ^-^) so I now have 90p, which is enough to get a bottle of Cherry Coke from school tomorrow.  And... I apologise for being a complete tit.  Love, Jon Roskilly
