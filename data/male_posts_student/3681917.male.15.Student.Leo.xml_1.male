So i was hitting wiffle balls around and one went into a patch of tall grass and weeds....I got very mad and literally started destroying the weeds...i finally got the ball back. Now a whole chunk of the patch of weeds is missing...it looks kinda funny. But anyways...I worked on a beta layout for my nusuni.com site. The picture of it is on  urlLink This Page !
