"Finished" final. Sucked. Big time. I hate it. So much. So angry. I wish I knew what room Speech was. But, I forgot somehow, dumb. So, ten minutes left. No way to burn it. Probably not supposed to be in this room. Wondering how I'm going to do my English paper tonight, study for math, etc. I can't. Nope. Not possible. Knowing me, I'll start at around midnight, type up the crappiest paper ever, and blah blah blah. Every paper is my worst paper ever. I don't enjoy writing anymore, although I used to a lot. Stupid, I wish I still did. It's useful to know how to write, to write letters and whatnot. Now I just stumble along. As you can tell. Which is why my blog is probably not very popular. I just type as thoughts come into my head. Weird thinking about my hands moving this fast. Things that come by instinct are amazing. Playing instruments, typing, etc. Crazy stuff if you think about it. Whatever. Angry that I have to stay to do Biology tests. I could just leave. That would be the "Donnie" thing to do. But no. I have to get some of these points back. I'm building a future here. I guess. Some future, eh? I've seen worse. Incoherent beggars living on the edge of life because they are afraid of change and life itself, in many cases. Yeah, that would suck. Lucky for me, my life will be great until July 11th or so. Yeah, then I'll be afraid of life. Just like about...the past 6 years of my life (save the last month, obvously). Typical.
