I don't think it's a good thing, but it could just be something akin to stage fright where I feel like there's so much pressure.  But I could handle it right now, so it's not that bad.  The people are nice, for the most part.  Very ghetto.  Everyone is really protective of their cash registers...understandable cuz they don't wanna be over or under, but I didn't think it'd be so...roar!  Funny customer story.  So there was this lady who took forever ordering.  It was, "well, I think I'll have.....umm.....maybe......umm...."  So on so forth.  When she FINALLY ordered, the guy that was helping was telling me what to do and explaining what she ordered.  As he was doing that, the lady was like, "I'm just gonna go over here!  This is taking forever, I'm on a busy schedule!"  This coming from the lady who took like 5 minutes to order while standing in front of the register.  Hypercritical much???  So yes...civil servant.  I shall now go and kill myself.  Thank you, please come again.
