If you're not getting how serious a problem this is, I'll point out that I'm nearly always content to sit down and play through a game I've already completely a billion times. YES!! EVEN THE PLAYSTATION VERSION OF SPACE INVADERS!!!!  I've never suffered from this problem before!  I've never had nothing to do for so long!  For as long as I can remember I always had 2 options if I ran out of ideas either  1) hang out with Alyssa or 2) play a video game  but I've already lost one of those options and so I'm stuck with video games, sure I can't get enough games EVER!  Hell, I love them almost as much as I do Alyssa, but FOR FUCK SAKE!! THERE'S ONLY SO FUCKING MUCH I CAN STAND!!!! and only 3 days before I go on holiday too! fucking hurry up Monday all fucking ready
