Here are a few tidbits:  urlLink In Blow to Bush, Only 32,000 Jobs Created in July  by David Leonhardt at the New York Times on August 7, 2004.  The Nasdaq and the S 500 indices are at 2004 lows. The Nasdaq has fallen 9.1%, the S 2.8%, over the past 7 months. Source:  urlLink Bulls are unfazed by long decline  by Adam Shell and Matt Krantz at USA TODAY on August 5, 2004. That fact seems to conflict with the unsourced "fact" you stated. Care to elaborate, Mike?      *As the print edition of this USA Today article asked, "In face of new lows, is it optimism - or denial?" Ask yourself that question, Mike, and get back to me on what you decide.
