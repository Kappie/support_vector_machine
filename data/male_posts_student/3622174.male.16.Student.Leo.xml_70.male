Welcome to the new Blog of the Bagel.  Now, you're going to get two posts a day, one during the day, and one at night.  The daytime post will be dedicated to stuff you can do on the internet, and will feature all sorts of things related to it, including reviews, tips, and more.    The night time post will be the same posts that you normally get, the stories of my life.  These will continue to run every single night (except for when I'm out of town, but even then I may update).    I'm working on adding some brand new features to The Blog of the Bagel.  So, in the next few days, you may see some brand new interactive features.  Be sure to check them out.  Now, I need to get some sleep, because I have to begin writing my "BagelTech" post for tomorrow.
