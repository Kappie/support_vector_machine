Police found violent plots, pictures, drugs, and other stuff that would make him out to be a dangerous person. But theres one thing that is extremely familiar with their case and what i did, they both got charged with the same felony charges as i did.  Theres one thing i want everyone to consider when they hear about this case, before saying to yourselves "jeez, this kid is an IDIOT, i cant believe that! he deserves the death penalty", before doing that i want you to think about his family and how they are feeling. Also think about the kid himself, the kid is 15 and hes already on the news! How damaging is that going to be for him? After hes gone to all of his anger management classes etc., whos going to go to the prom with him? Whos going to be his friend? Just consider it. Because sometimes the media can make things seem different than they actually are, trust me they can. Update: People seem to misunderstand what im saying, im NOT saying hes innocent, im saying that once hes paid for what hes done where does he go from there? And will his punishment ever stop?
