The first time I really talked to Bob was online when he was having a problem with his woman. It just seems like when you start getting really close they pull away. They rip your heart out of your chest and stomp on it. Doesn't it feel nice? I know that it's a part of life and that eventually everything will work out for the best, all that shit, but what about right now? I don't know about anyone else, but i want my last high school summer to be an awesome. I thought that a certain someone was gonna be there with me for the ride and then we would come to some kind of understanding when I went to college. Things never work out the way you want them to. All a guy has in his life is his family, his friends, and his car and most of the time you have a problem with 2 out of the 3. Don't tell me that everything will be alright, just tell me that you know a really hot girl that's looking for a vulnerable guy to bang and then never talk to again. Thanks guys.
