Me likey. And as a reminder, all this stuff is pro-republican, just to clear that up, did you think I would be anti? Surely not!   urlLink Vast Right Wing Conspiracy   I want to become a member and wear this all day long...lol...sadly it's true, I'm that hardcore of a Republican.  I'm off to watch Conan O'Brian...gotta love that Walker Texas Ranger Handle thing...LOLOLOLOL!
