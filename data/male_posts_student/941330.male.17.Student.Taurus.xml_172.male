CUT THE CRAP.  edit 8:49 pm: oh yea, today i finally had to pay up for losing the bet (rams v. niners couple weeks back) to mr. o, and he really made me pay. man, there goes $19 (i throw away change unless it's quarters, but i hate quarters too). we went to dino's for lunch, we each had a monte cristo sandwich (scrambled eggs, bacon, ham on toast). good stuff. just up to 6 years ago he worked for frito-lay in west oakland, crazy. he can't teach anything above honors geometry cuz he needs to get a master's in math or something, but he's too lazy to go back to school. (he's like 6 points of 75 away from maxing out his accreditation and salary.) stats/calc with mr.o would be fun though. also, the sophs want to marry his coconuts, but mr. o's gonna make individual classes get 10 perfect scores to attain that prestigious honor. on a different tack, he and mr. cory think that the way to solve government problems is to create a flat tax, 10 cents of every dollar go to federal tax and 5 cents to state, you pocket the rest. get rid of pork and our country would be humming. and mr. cory knows a tiny bit about football! he rules.  edit 9:14 pm: thanks to the advice of one of emmalyn's sophisticated  urlLink collegiate connections , my bike has been newly cleansed with the glory of wd-40.
