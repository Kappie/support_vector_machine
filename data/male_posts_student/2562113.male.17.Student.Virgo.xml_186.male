So i go to this huge banquet hall with the black guy from oceans 11 (were gonna be in barney... RUBBLE? ... TROUBLE!), we get these huge guns (augs and m-16s with grenade launchers), and we go in and fuck the mob up. then i woke up to the reality that i live in rockland county, and that i will never fuck the mob up with a cool black person with a british accent. MAN I WISH I LIVED IN DREAMWORLD sometimes, cause i would f hott bitches and kill mobsters like it was my job.  PS, i watched the sopranos and "point break" where they do a drug bust before i went to sleep, so i think it affected my dream. None the less, it was awsome.
