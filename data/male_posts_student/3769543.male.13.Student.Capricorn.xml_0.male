The game looked really fun, and it was  free , so that really caught my eye. One hell of a big file, though. 736 MB! I had to leave my computer on all night to download it.  It was  so  worth it.  The game is downright awesome, but the folliage is a little, well... "Flat". By that, I mean it's 2-D. Most games are like that, though. Oh well. This game has realistic weapons, because it was done and paid for by the U.S. Army. (I think... Yeah, it was). Hella fun. Download it if you ever have 12 spare hours.  Next subject.  I'm not getting much sleep lately, and I'm not too sure why. I might be sick, but I sure hope not. My performance is in what, 2 days now? Jeez. Anna bought a set of knives, which scares me. She has been plotting my death for a long time, if you haven't known.  Very  scary...  I didn't have all too good of a day today. I got dirt thrown on me by Nick and Rachel. Fucking bastards... I guess I deserved it. Yeah, I did. Oh well. I'm still upset. Anna's brother wont let me fix her computer, so I guess I wont. Good for asking, right? I guess actually  doing  it is really better.  Might post some more before I go to sleep.  [edit] If you comment on my blog, please leave your name. Don't worry, I wont stalk you. I have that problem of my own to deal with.
