He was over near Bailey Middle School (w/in four blocks of his house) and four black guys (between ages 14-16) came up to him. One of them asked for a cigarette and when Dad told them that he didn't smoke they started to punch and kick him. Fortunately, a neighbor came out of their house to take out some garbage and saw what was going on and somehow managed to scare off the attackers. The police came, took Dad to the hospital and he's got a broken nose and lots of stiches. 
 They were probably going for money or something (maybe just for fun) but all that he had on him were his house keys. What the hell is wrong with society these days?
