I've already accepted that fact. lol  Who really gives a rats ass anyways.  The second that bell rings at 2 o'clock I'm out of there for the summer.  Well except for the 10 minutes on Wednesday when we have to clean out our god damn lockers... oh well.  I'm probably not even going to that... screw the administration, they can kiss my ass.  It's summer and I'm outta there.  Some people think I'm insane... so I've edited posts and changed some stuff... as to not look  too  insane.... and to those that know me better than most... just keep the question of sanity to yourselves...  I'm  really  not insane.   Maybe a little out there, but not insane. lol  So it's Friday.  You know what that means?      Wait... what  does  that mean in the summer... hmmm   I guess it doesn't really mean much of anything... I can sleep until noon on any day except Wednesday this summer...  Man is the drumline going to kick some major ass this year.  Four hour practices every Wednesday from 9am to 1pm.  So sweet.    So excited!!!       YAY!  Okay I'm bored.  I'm outta here.
