Decent movie, but it just doesn't seem as good as some of M. Night Shyamalan's other movies(The Sixth Sense and Signs to name a couple).  I saw the Twins play the Red Sox tonight at the Metrodome. it was pretty crazy up there! The Twins first baseman Doug Mientkewitz surprised everyone tonight.. last night he was playing first base for the Twins in the Metrodome but tonight he was playing first base for the Red Sox in the Metrodome. They must have traded him in the last 24 hours. Funny. The Twins won 5-4, so it was all good. Also, these college kids behind us were extremely tanked and kept muttering random things like "I wonder what kind of bats they would use if baseballs were made of cheese" and other nonsensical things. They also thought that the Twins were playing the White Sox. Haha.  Tomorrow Billy goes home, he is my cousin who went on vacation with us this year. We always take a cousin with us on our family vacations. Along with Billy goes the loaded 2003 Dodge Caravan my Grandpa allowed us to borrow for the trip. He's not going to appreciate that we put 2000 miles on his new van in a week. Sorry gramps, but it's time for another oil change again.  That's my weekend.. band camp in t-minus 2 weeks.  I also find it interesting that love is the only thing that is easiest to find when you aren't looking for it..
