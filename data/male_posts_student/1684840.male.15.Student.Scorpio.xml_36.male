The lightening was very thick and much brighter than ours, louder thunder rumbles too.    I'm gradually making my mind up over moving over here.  So far I'm 80% for it.  I'm gonna miss a hell of a lot of things, right down the the last red post box :)  Might be going a few places tomorrow, and I hopefully won't forget to update this blog which has been sitting here for days without a post (sorry!).  Good Night :)
