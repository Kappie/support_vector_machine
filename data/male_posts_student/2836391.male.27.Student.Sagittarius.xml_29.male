Although usually I am pretty technologically literate, when it comes to web stuff I am useless.  Working hard on assignments the last couple of weeks has left me little time to blog, but has given me plenty of things to think about, so look out for more ramblings to come. The tale of a driveway, a large pile of dirt, and several 'customer care representatives' who didn't, is probably the next story to appear.  Watch this space   But not for too long, cause its just a space, and probably won't do anything exciting, even if you are watching  Probably  because  you're watching
