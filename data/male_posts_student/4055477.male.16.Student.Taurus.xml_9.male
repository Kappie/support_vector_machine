I know it sounds funny but then again, you haven't seen my actual journal  have you?  Anyways..  - Lots of things goin on in my life that are a little "stressful" to say the least.. (living the suburban life is hard..  i swear it is! )  Hopefully this year will start out new b/c moving to Ohio in December was about the  worst decision my mom ever made . I'll try to make some new friends and not be the guy who speeds to class b/c there's nobody to talk to in the hallway.. ( I'm pretty sure that one day my pants caught flame.. No, seriously.. )
