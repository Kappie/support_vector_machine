It's not that nothing is happening, it's an overflood of what has been happening. My nice secure world of bachelorism just came crashing down on Monday, or was it Tuesday night....  It's something that I feel is too personal to talk about here, although it is easier to tell strangers about things happening in my life because the implications that they have on my life is possibly very small... They are far, far away, most of them anyway....  I'll try to come up with some interesting thoughts soon, so keep on reading, ok? And continue clicking that refresh button ya!
