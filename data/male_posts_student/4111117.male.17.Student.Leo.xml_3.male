HAMPTON! a set unworthy of all the history phish has filled that place with over the years, from their incredible '98 run there to their triumphant return in '03, it oozes history, not just for phish, but for the grateful dead as well. this was the site of the return of the warlocks show in october 89. there set lists for a two-night stand:  Hampton Coliseum, Hampton, VA, 10/8-9 1989  10/8   Set 1:  Foolish Heart, Walkin' Blues, Candyman, Me and My Uncle, Big River, Stagger Lee, Queen Jane, Approximately, Bird Song, The Promised Land  Set 2  :Help on the Way > Slipknot! > Franklin's Tower, Victim or the Crime > Eyes of the World > Drums > Space > I Need a Miracle > The Wheel > Gimme Some Lovin' > Morning Dew Encore: And We Bid You Good Night  10/9    Set 1 : Feel Like a Stranger, Built to Last, Little Red Rooster, Ramble on Rose, We Can Run, Jack-A-Roe, Stuck in Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again, Row Jimmy, The Music Never Stopped  Set 2:  Playing in the Band > Uncle John's Band > Playing in the Band Reprise > Dark Star > Drums > Space > Death Don't Have No Mercy > Dear Mr. Fantasy > Hey Jude Reprise > Throwing Stones > Good Lovin' Encore: Attics of My Life  The Grateful Dead pulled out all the stops, with Brett Mydland laying down some fierce sounds from the boards, bob and jerry's thrashing guitar licks resonated, and phil's, and mickey and bill's bass line was grandiose. You see, this is why i'm disappointed. Phish is done in a week. One last week for them to pull out all of the stops, and they give us a 5 song first set! i'm not complaining about the song selection, but in the second set, a crowd control! come on! i'm just a little disappointed that they chose to end their illustrious hampton career with a second set closing Character Zero, but from what i've heard, the Bowie encore was sick, possibly the best Bowie encore of all time, first one since 11-16-97 and only the fifth one ever. but again, no nod to the old man, no onstage antics, no phil or bob, seems a little of a bummer when you expected the world.  theres a lesson in that: when you expect the world, you will be unpleasently disappointed  don't disappoint people. and remember that no matter what time of day it is, YOU CAN STILL WRITE COMMENTS ABOUT MY POSTS!  coooool breeze
