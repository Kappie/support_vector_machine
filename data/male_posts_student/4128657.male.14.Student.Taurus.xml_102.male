I used gold cording to match the gold swirl pattern on the fabric. I made the pocket larger than the first bag I made and put a seam in the middle to divide the pocket. This is such an easy project. I think the hardest part is finding the cording to use for the straps and top opening. I final found it at Betty's in San Luis Obispo. While I was there I also discovered in the last two weeks they have added a whole yarn department that includes lots of different needles and pattern books.
