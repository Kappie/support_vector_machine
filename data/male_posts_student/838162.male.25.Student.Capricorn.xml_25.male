Not too bad, some were tricky but I completed it way ahead of time. Don’t really know what I was so worried about. I even put off writing on the blog just to study. I guess it’s this studying and working at the same time thing, or perhaps it’s the “so-long-never-study-don’t-know-how-to-anymore” feeling I was getting. No matter, I’m glad its over. I have another test this Sat so I’m not free from the books yet. Not to mention the coming exams. I’ll be so glad when Christmas comes around. All my burdens would have passed away. It may even surpass Christmas 2000 as the best Christmas so far in my life.    This is the final week that I have to report to camp in the mornings. For someone who have gotten used to waking up at 5:30 almost every morning for the last 2 years, 5 months and 1 week, I can’t understand why it’s been so difficult the last few days. I must be totally into the ORD mood. Good in a way, just hope I can last the week.  Was doing some quiet time after lunch today and I started thinking of the Audio and Logistics Ministry that I am a part of in church. I mused on the increased responsibility that awaits me when I join back the ministry in full. As always the lack of manpower is at the foremost of my mind. I am now considering a recruitment drive, most likely after the Youth Camp. Will give this more thought. What you do think?  Been spending a lot of time with my younger brother Nigel as of late. It is amazing how much he as grown in the past year since I returned from my overseas posting. In many ways I am glad that I was able to witness most of it. He has lost loads of his baby fat from daily soccer games, has developed his built with early trips to the gym, push-ups and some light free weights. He even wears the same size shoes as me now. Scary. Now I have to keep watch on his emotional and mental growth. Not an easy task. Since I have to keep a close watch on my own as well. Hmm..
