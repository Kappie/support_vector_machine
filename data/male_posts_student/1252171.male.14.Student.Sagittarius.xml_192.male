"He's been gone for quite a while," Knumchuck points out. "He'll be here soon, don't worry," Foxy says, reassuringly. Suddenly, the door bursts open and in walks Sa2b. "Hey, guys, guess what?" "Oh, you mean guess what you were doing for THREE FREAKING HOURS?!?!?" exclaims Camo. "Noooo, guess where we're going!" "Where?" asks Foxy, excitedly. "We're going to DISNEY WORLD!!" screams Sa2b. "YAAAAAAAAYY!!" everyone yells. "ONWARD!" Sa2b says, as they all vanish.  Reex Cave, Subterranean Disney World Sa2b, Knumchuck, Camo, and Foxy appear in a puff of smoke. "Where are we?" Camo asks. "Dude, didn't you read the subtitles? It said we're in Reex cave, obviously a walk-through ride at this new part of the park called 'Subterranean Disney World,'" explained Sa2b, as he broke the fourth wall. "Well, let's find the exit," Knumchuck suggests. While everybody walks off, Camo is busy looking at the rock formations. "These look too real to be fake...." Suddenly, a red cat with dark red stripes wearing a black tanktop and denim shorts bumps in to Camo. "Sorry," she says. As she is saying that, Camo notices that she has orange hair, red eyes, and three orange circles on her forehead and temples. She then runs off. When Camo catches up to everyone, he asks, "Hey, did any of you see that gi-" He is cut off when Sa2b grabs the top of his head and turns it in the direction they are looking. Camo suddenly sees this huge, blue, gelatinous monster with green tentacles all over its body. "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!" they all scream. The monster turns and sees them and lets out a huge roar right in thier faces. The four try to run away, but the monster grabs them and starts squeezing. You see, if serious pressure is inflicted on Sa2b and his friends, there powers have no effect.   Thenextpartwillbeveryshortbut to be contiued...  -Sane Intolerant-
