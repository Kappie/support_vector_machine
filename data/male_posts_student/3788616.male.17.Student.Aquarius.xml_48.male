Haha… heex… today, spent the whole day outside and had lots of fun! Haha…  Went out to Cherie’s place today to ‘study’, haha… oh well, that certainly happened didn’t it? Well, I went there and ended up, pretty late and well, in my panic, I pressed the bell cause actually also because my dear friend Wan Yi gave me the most vague descriptions ever! Haha… than I ended up walking all the way the stop facing Bukit Pangang Methodist Church lah! Wah lau! What an interesting walk man! Walked up and down until Wan Yi saw me and I saw Cherie! Haha… it was a great feeling seeing them! Heex…  Yeah well, proceeded to ‘study’ but in the end, we went out to Bukit Timah Plaza and on the way, we met Chris! Haha, invited him along cause… heh heh heh… ssh… however, he had to head to school 1st so he joined us later… but anyway, ended up playing pool and man! I really suck lah! Wah lau! The 2 girls thrash me like don’t know what lah! Damn it! Bleah… oh well, Chris only came at the end lah! Wah lau! Damn it! Haha… bleah, but I think Cherie is really quite good lah! You go girl! Heex… ;p anyway, hadn’t had so much fun since I don’t know when also lah! Haha… just kidding around and stuff! Haha…  I think the best part was when we started playing with the chalk lah! Cherie used the cue to poke me right at the forehead so I had this dot right in the middle… heh heh heh, here comes revenge, I rub my fingers in the chalk and wiped it on her face lah! Haha… than wah lau, note this, NEVER EVER disturb girls! I was soon attacked both sides by Cherie and Wan Yi, leaving both my cheeks with streaks of blue! Damn it lah! Haha… but it was fun lah! Haha…  Anyway, we back and Cherie and Wan Yi nearly pushed me into the pool lah! Wah damn heng I managed to hold on! Haha… oh well, we went on to study… but, Wan Yi soon fell sick so I had to do her Chinese work for her, though it was pretty fun to do… Chris was working pretty hard, though he looked so frustrated! Haha… and, Cherie? Haha… well, SOMEBODY just refused to start on her studies lah! And SHE has a test tomorrow! Man… Girl study hard lah! Good luck yeah! All the best!  Anyway, headed off to meet Gabriel for a swim, but just as we were reaching his home, I remembered that a guest was waiting for me at home, so now I owe Gabriel one! Hey man, I owe you! Sorry!  Haha… ate one of my favourite dishes! Curry, erm… buoakolok or something like that lah! Haha… oh well, it tested really fantastic lah! Heex…oh oh oh! Haha, I was actually in charge of breaking the shells before my mum cooked it! Haha, guess what?! Haha… I actually hit once shell such that a love shaped sign appeared on the shell surface! Cool eh?! Haha… what to do? Haha… I am just too good lah! Haha… *ego*  Anyway, overall, it’s a great day today lah! Hmm, I guess, there are a few things I would like to say about everything though… 1st of all, Thanks Chris and Wan Yi for being great sports! Haha… you guess were really great to hang out with… Thanks Gabriel for inviting me! Haha… will swim you some other time yeah? Most probably after your damn prelims or ‘A’s lah ah?! Haha…  Most importantly, thanks Cherie! You really am a bomb lah! Thanks for inviting me to your place and making me feel really wanted! Heex… thanks yeah?! Haha… I owe you one… anyway, hope you like the card! Do take care ok?! And please for heavens sake, EAT! Don’t get gastric anymore cause you refuse to eat lah! You so thin already and than you still don’t eat, you want to die is it? Please take care of yourself ok? Seeing you in pain, hurts me leh! Thanks once again for being such a great person! All the best for your test and enjoy yourself!  Oh! i do NOT look like a monkey lah! Wah lau eh?! May be at times, but, that's basically the way it was shot lah! wah lau, looking at my hand band, give me some credit lah! Wah lau eh! haha... anyway, so nice... Missing... already... oh well...  Hmm… well, that says it all… To everyone out there who’s down? Well, remember this, friends are always there for you! Trust me! I know, that’s why I am able to tell you all these, cause I know the strength of friendship and certainly the power of GOD. Cause, without GOD, would I have been able to meet such great and wonderful people? I don’t think so, so everyone who’s down or happy alike, have lots of fun and place your faith in the LORD! hmm... i would like to thank GOD especially for Cherie to come into my life at the most appropriate time in my life! Keep smiling! :p
