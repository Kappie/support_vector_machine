NOT to see how much crap you've memorized about the 15 bazillion tariffs in revolutionary-era america. that's why the socratic seminar in english appeals to me, except when we use stupid books like  farewell to arms  and idiots like vanessa talk over everybody and impress us with how much of sparknotes they can memorize. and that's exactly why the genre project and history poster are big steaming stinking piles of dog crap. for the genre project, the collective prettiness of the poster, timeline and multimedia supplement is given just about as much weight as the genres themselves. WHAT THE SHIT IS THAT. i would hope that in an ENGLISH class, creativity, insight and depth in writing would be a bit more important than adding sparkles to a fucking posterboard.   oh, the history poster. sorry people who presented today, but today showcased just why our history class is completely worthless. the first poster's analogy towards the gilded age was thoroughly uninspired and unconvincing, and the so-called similarities were strung together with sewing thread. the second poster looked stylish, but was CRAP. this isn't art class, dammit. the poster had twenty billion pictures that had nothing to do with history, and the explanations didn't even ATTEMPT to link to anything remotely relating to the analogy. maybe because they had no ideas in the first place? half of the presenters read their explanations straight off of paper (if you're not gonna bother memorizing your twnety seconds of speech, just read from the damn book and save us the pretense). another presenter tried really hard to recall specific details but ended up listing blatantly obvious generalities of the time period (interjected with "umm"s every five seconds) for two minutes too long. then of course, we realize that since every group must compare EVERYTHING about the gilded age to their analogy instead of just a certain sector, every group will be repeating the EXACT same things, but of course weissenborn doesn't really care about originality now does she?
