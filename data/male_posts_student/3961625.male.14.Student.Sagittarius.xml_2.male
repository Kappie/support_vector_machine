We had absoulutely no trouble finding the place, and when we arrived Ben was playing chess with Lotte and Mia was hitting them over the head with a big fuzzy and incredibly ugly teddy. Ine arrived soon aafter from the loo, and so I greeted her and Uncle David with hugs. Their caravan was very nice and I settled down to a game of chess with Ben while the adults talked. This game didn´t last very long because Lotte brought out her equally ugly teddy and the girls took it in turns to hit us over the head. So we left. We drove quickly to Brugge Central and parked the car, where Uncle David drew a small crowd while unloading his bicycle. Then we set off along a crowded canal towards the center of the city. This took about half an hour because the schlock shops worked their magic on the two younger ones. Ben was fairly resilient... We arrived at an old church and had lunch while we waited for it to open at 1:30. When it did, we went inside and had a look. Turned out that this was the church that housed  Madonna and Child , which I admired and photographed. We then headed down to the canal and tooke a very touristy but quite pleasant boat tour. I sat right next to the "Captain" who looked rather apprehensively at my camera when I got in, but at the end of the trip thanked me profuselyfor only taking only one picture. Poor man must be driven to drink by all the clicking! As soon as we arrived in city center it started to rain, so we decided to climb the belfry, except Ine didn´t want to (towerphobia or whatever it´s called) and Uncle David could´t, so Mia, Ben and I went up by ourselves. This tower was only 364 steps, but the view was good, so it was fun. By the time we got down it was time to go so we sauntered, then walked, the ran headlong for the station. I managed to leap on to the moving train with a quick goodbye yell to the rest of them. Two stations and half an hour later, I was in Gent!
