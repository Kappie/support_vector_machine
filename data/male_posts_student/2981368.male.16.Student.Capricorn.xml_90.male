Haven't talked to him for a while, which may or may not have been a good thing. He is completely insane, lives somewhere in the US and is training to become a lawyer. God help his clients. Heres some of the things he had to say, on various pressing issues.  -------------------------------   NOTHING IN PARTICULAR   Eli (11:46): it's like the batpoles! Eli (11:46): TO THE DOCKING BAY!
