As soon as we arrived, the first thing we did was check our chemistry grades.  All I can say is that I was very, very, lucky and relieved!!  Yes, the class didn't do so hot, but I thankfully managed to do rather well.  Anatomy also went just as well as I had anticipated, though, I feel so dumb for missing the bonus marks.  Now get this, the question was, "name 3 types of membranes and list their functions".  I was soooo thinking in terms of cell structure that I just wrote down plasma membrane, nuclear membrane and ribosomal membrane, while totally ignoring what I should have put down - namely serous, mucous, and synovial membranes. DUH!  Right now, I'm in the process of trying to memorize about 50 words.  Here's a word and some clinical applications of it: Angina pectoris â€“ a feeling of constriction around the heart or pain that  may radiate to the left arm or shoulder, usually brought on by exertion; caused by insufficient blood supply to the heart.  Oh yeah, before I forgot, I actually installed AIM today.  Yes, I hate AOL, but all the American's here use it so I was coerced into installing it, lol.  Ok, bye.
