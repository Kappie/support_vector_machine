I feel totally devoted to my home state, the wonderous lands and animals and people. I have had some of the best times here, times I will never forget.  This is such a big move for me, I am very excited to see another plan close to completion. Some things are not so easily planned. Often times, trouble steps in the way, but so far I've made it through just fine. It's is my last day at work, I have worked at EJB for over 4 years and it's so weird to think that I have been spending Mon. - Fri. at the same place for FOUR years. I will miss all the guys here, they are all great in some way or another. Most of all, I will miss my friends. Each and everyone of them in a special way. I have a feeling some tears will surface today, it will be tough to keep my emotions under wraps.  I am going to try and get off around 4pm and tie up a few things before heading over to Nick's House. After that, we will load up his stuff and head out into the sunset, like an old western movie.  It's going to be a long trip, I'm already super tired. I need to pick up some vivrin and redbull or something. It's gonna be a late one. I'll miss my friends.  My heart aches, but the ties are not severed and the contact will continue.  Wish me luck, I will need it...
