I met my friend Elma and her roommate to check out the festivities first hand.  From the crowds of people waiting to ride the train, you would think that the people here have never ridden a subway train before.    After riding through several stations, we went back towards the university to meet up with Alec.  Following lunch at a chinese restaurant (my fortune stated:  "Don't expect romantic attachments to be strictly logical or rational!" ;) ) we headed back downtown to the Metrodome for the Twins-Brewers game.    The game itself was not noteworthy (the Twins lost 7-2).  However we were scolded during the singing of the national anthem by a militant ueber nationalist Brewers fan for not demonstrating proper respect for the country.    All in all this was a very good Saturday.
