Really, ALL I've been doing. I think it has just been my mood lately, which has been very detatched and just weird. It has started a nice little self perpetuating cycle: my disconnection feeds my incessant drawing and visa versa. Drawing pictures of grossly deformed, copulating sharks into the wee hours of the night does something to you. I wouldn't mind being like this all the time. Kind of like a constant version of that feeling you get when you nap for a really long time and you wake up thinking you are late for school/work and franticly get ready and go only to realize you are 12 hours early...Well, not exactly like that, but kind of...Actually not really.   tomorrow, i.e Judgment Day, should be fun...Let the execution begin. Smek.
