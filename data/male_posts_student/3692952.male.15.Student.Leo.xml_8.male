From my observation, no one was watching it. then it was the "harmoni" dance...the indian dance was ok..chinese was ok toobut the malay dance is funny! (maybebecos' kevin and aaron were dancing..) then the finale and all...they "sang" gemilang, and then it ended with the national anthem.   well, the hari anugerah (2004) was ok...at least the food was ok. but i think the waiters and waiteresses were kinda pissed with our table...cos we kept asking for sumthing...first we asked for coffee...then he came with the coffee ONLY...then karen asked for tea, he came with tea only, then kim and lyn asked for coffee again. then later on, we had no more milk, so one waiteress passed by and we asked her for milk (dun think dirty, k?)and when she left, we realised wedo not have any sugar left too. then she came with the milk and then we asked her for sugar. she then walked away and came back with the sugar. i could sense the "tidak puas hati" feeling when i drank the coffee...  so, after hari anugerah, i rushed home and changed my clothes (in less than 5 minutes) and left cos we had to go to my grandma's hse...my aunt from england is back. then i came back bout...5 sumthing and then i came online and wrote this. later, i will have to do my PEKA physics, and also my add maths homework...(still havent finished it..its damn hard...) so, wish me luck and ciaoz!  (._.)v peace!!
