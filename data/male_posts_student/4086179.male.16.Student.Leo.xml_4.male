Their new look is very kool, and I cannot wait for their album to come out on August 30. The first time thatg I heard that song on the trailer to Spiderman 2 oh my gosh... then I found out that it was Killing Heidi, now that was a big surprise. Then there is Franz Ferdinand. Their debut single, "Take me out" is a work of art.  urlLink http://www.franzferdinand.co.uk,  check it out...
