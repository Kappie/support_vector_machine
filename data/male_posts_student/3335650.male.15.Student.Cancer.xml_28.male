" Ok, i don't mean to sound mean (pun there), but you spelling really is appalling... even by my year 9 standards... My sister, who's six, can write better! l'm not asking for 100% spelling, just for you to read through what you've written and correct it. Anyways... My holidays:Nothing planned for half-term, but in the summer I'll be flying to switzerland a couple of times :) that's the life! Also have a 10-day class-trip to sweden coming up, but don't worry, I'll keep you updated by e-mail over my phone. If you're lucky, you'll even get pictures :)  In other news:  A txt from Lou: "Yellow! Im bored and my feet hurt! =o(xxxxxxxxxxx" Well, Lou, my dear, what do you expect me to do about that?  That's what I could reply with, if l was being sincere or something, but seeing as I have no credit at this point in time, speculating 'bout my reply's rather pointless anyway... sorry Lou! Just doing my paper-round...  Oh what fun!   Laters!  LoZ
