The televised funeral gave the Democratic senator a chance to re-establish closeness, if not intimacy, with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, she told reporters at her Washington office this morning. "It was great, nostalgic, a trip down memory lane" she continued. "Sleeping with Bill was always a lot of fun, as I recall. And hopefully, we'll have a similar opportunity in the future, either on the solemn occasion of someone else's death or at an inaugural ball."   Bill and Hillary Clinton managed to get some much-needed shut eye at the National Cathedral, sleep they both needed in advance of a gruelling book tour and a tough campaign season. "Oh, and Reagan was a lovely man," Senator Clinton added.   If you liked this piece, check out  urlLink Broken Newz  and the rest of their funny works...
