Here's something marginally funnier (that's not saying much), about all the debates the Democratic candidates have been having:  To the tune of "Scarborough Fair (Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme)" by Simon  Garfunkel:  Are we having another debate? Moseley Braun, Kucinich, and Clark Al Sharpton, Lieberman, Edwards, and Dean Gephardt, Kerry; Bob Graham dropped out.  Ask what they think of the war in Iraq    (And if they think it's good we caught Saddam Hussein)  If the state should pay for health care    (Let's take the profit out, Kucinich says)  Tax cuts are bad? Or tax cuts are good?    (Tax cuts are bad when the richest pay less)  Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs    (Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, war)   Tell them to seal up my records of old     (Tell them federal matching funds, not what I need)  Bush hates trees, and animals too    (He's dumping poisons in rivers and streams)  Go to the left and I'll tack to the right     (Balance the primary with what comes next)  Caucus, primary, caucus, please vote  Are we having another debate? Moseley Braun, Kucinich, and Clark Al Sharpton, Lieberman, Edwards, and Dean Gephardt, Kerry; Bob Graham dropped out.
