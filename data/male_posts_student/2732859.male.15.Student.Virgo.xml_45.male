He is  NOT    a Democrat.  You can see the transcript from his interview with Tim Russert  urlLink http://http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5574180/  here.  He is against a woman's right to choose, he is for the Marriage Amendment, and he is against Gun control, just to name a few things.  He fully supports the War in Iraq and has complains about how the Democratic Party has gone too far to the left for him.  He says that it has changed.  Well Zell, things have changed since the 1950's!!!  You are a Republican!!!  Just switch parties and get it over with.  The Republican party has also changed because issues and situations change.  Communism isn't an issue anymore.   If you want an example of flip-flopping,  just look at Senator Miller.  He delivered the keynote address at the 1992 Democratic National Convention that nominated Bill Clinton.  He supported Al Gore in 2000 and in 2001 spoke about Senator Kerry in very kind words.  He should leave the Party now because we don't want him.
