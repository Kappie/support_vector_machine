I've needed my wisdom teeth pulled for ages now, but my parents ignore my all but subtle hints (T_T). I can feel them crowding around and sometimes try to manually push them back (XD). I'm such a loser. If I drink enough cold water, it numbs the pain (:D), not exactly the best remedy, but it soothes, OH HOW IT SOOTHES! *deep exhalation* So I guess not much is going on in my life right now. Now that I can't think of anything really to write about. I suppose I'll skip days like these when nothing of note pops up in my mind or elsewhere. I hate running down my writing average for this, but this is, again, for myself, fundamentally. I find writing thoughts out to be therapeutic, and since I can't even decipher poetry, let alone write it, simple prose will just have to do. I've stopped writing the story, by the way. Nothing permanent, just hiatus, I can't write and draw at the same time: it hurts my head. Okay, well I ought to shower and workout as I'm long overdue for the latter. G'night.
