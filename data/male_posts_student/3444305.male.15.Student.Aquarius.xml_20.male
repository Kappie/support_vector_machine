We took notes for half of the time today, and then we got to go into "committees" and pass bills and revise them and kill them. It was actually pretty fun. Jenny, she is harsh in that lol. She stole my papers and stuffed them in her pocket because I had many many bills passed that I wrote myself. She wasn't a happy camper. Nananana! I beat you! Oh is it fun to act like a third grader again. After school, I gave Ryn a ride home, and then came home for a little. And then my mom asked if I wanted to go to Chili's with her, my sister, and her boyfriend, Jason. So I went, and it was pouring down rain. Like a huge downpour. It was pretty cool, I love to watch rain. It's very interesting. I know I'm a loser so shut up. We got chips and salsa and then I got backed potato soup. Which was really good. Then we came home, in the lots and lots of rain. And then my sister and Jason went back to St. Louis. So I said goodbye to them, and really after that I did nothing at all today. I just sat around. I ate dinner, and then just sat aorund again. It was raining so I couldn't go outside. I finally got to go out tonight, and it was all foggy. Wow it was erie but really cool. It's like one of those nights that you sneak out and go have a sayons (spelling? even though I have a spell checker on this, I'm just way to lazy) in the graveyard at 12:00. Like on Now and Then! Great movie, thankfully someone else knows that movie besides me. And that girl is the coolest in the world, Amanda! But that would be so cool to go out there so late at night, and with it all foggy. Wow I want to do it. But it was to wet to stay outside for a long time, so I came back in and desided to do my APS even though it's not due till Wendsday. Well I got it all done thankfully meaning I have no homework tomorrow night, hopefully that is. I can watch Summerland with out having to worry about homework. Whitney just told me this story I kinda understood lol. I guess I would of had to of been there. Something about a kid they thought it looked like me, but then it was to big to be me lol. Well in Amy's mind she thought it was me lol. And Amanda is sad tonight! So she went to bed to try to get happy, hopefully she does! Or I'll have to tell her a lame joke for she might laugh at that! Hopefully that is lol. And I just found out Whitney has feelings for food. Maybe that will make Amanda happy because that's hilarious lol. Brian just got online to wait for his mom to get out of the bathroom, he has to go to camp tomorrow. We are both going to be dead tomorrow. Oh well! Well I really really need sleep. Night!
