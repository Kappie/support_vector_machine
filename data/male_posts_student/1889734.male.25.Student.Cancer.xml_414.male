If this trade comes through, there could be an unprecedented change in my Top Ten Most Hated List.  It would rank as thus:     The Yankees (previously number 2)   The Red Wings (previously number 1)   Hitler   France   Bono   Rosie   The smug IT guy   Bill Maher   Neon Deon   Anyone who winks     Anyone care to post their list?
