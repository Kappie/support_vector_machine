That movie ALWAYS makes me feel better.  I also watched Paycheck, which was really fucking awsome.  -  I got a new X-box controller, so now I finally have two, and I've been trying to get someone in my house for target practice in Halo.  I need to get back in shape for that Lan party tomorrow.  -  I actually bought a Pok√©mon game, and I was impressed on it's translation to the GBA. I'm still dissapointed in the fact that there's not an aventure one for the GCN.  -  My graphics card has been throwing a fit since we got it, so now it's yanked untill we can find some cheap RAM.  Yeah, I'm pissed off.  -  Got new headphones too.  They're huge, so I'm never gonna be seen out of the house with them.  -  To anyone who insists on calling my house and leaving a message, It would be a whole lot easier if you'd just call my cellphone.  Not only will it be on my person at all times, but you can call at anytime.  -  My dad's on an eating healthy frenzy.  I've been eating good things at school, but I do so I can eat junk when I want to.  -  I'm gonna go practice killing other humans in a virtual ring world.  Bye for now.
