Ofcourse guys hanging out really doesn't mean anything considering we talked about "empty" topic (alot like empty calories).  Saturday was better, my Father ordered tickets online for the Matrix, and we drove Idris and Co. to the Theatre.  We came the show before the actual rush, so we managed to get in no problem and get good seats.  I was pretty jittery during the movie, like my neck wouldn't stay still, and even the slightest noise would make me visibly tense up.  I guess maybe because I was cold (I don't remember being anxious about the movie).  For anyone who hasn't seen Matrix Reloaded, it's good, but also keep in mind good is a broad definition.  The plot?  What plot? It's to confusing to understand watching it once, and is probubly one of those movies you need to watch in the whole triology to actually feel it properly.  Also if you haven't seen it yet, wait until after the credits to see the trailor for the last movie in the triology.  It looks like it has even more special effects, and will be all about insane amounts of violence and all that poo-lah.   Today, we had to go to Church early because Nia was dancing in the girls dance troupe (actually it's THE dance troupe, but it doesn't really matter does it?).  They were really good at dancing, and the music was one of the best contemporary Christian pieces I've heard in ages.  The service following the dance I didn't like.  We had some overly "urban" guest minister who did the sterotypical baptist movements, and yelling and all of that stuff that would bother a little Methodist boy like me (considering most Methodist minister aren't known for screaming to the point where they need to gasp for air).  He didn't even really say anything, he based his sermon off a Letter of Paul (which he probubly didn't even write) and it was about having joy. Then he starts complaining about other churches Ushers..... Whatever.  I really need to become a more secular christian.  Of course staying to see the dancing again, in the later service I realized why I don't plan on it.  So many hot girls, like the type that you can't look at to long without twitching.  Haha.  That's a real hopeless romantic quote.  Now here I am waiting for around 7 to go to a Synagogue to hear Corey Booker talk about what he always does, because I love him so.
