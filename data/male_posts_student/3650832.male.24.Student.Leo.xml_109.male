Okay, it’s bought. Sure, “evil” makes itself felt because it is an acting force, while happiness implies a culmination. But… But… Wow, you really thought this thing through…  Yes, I agree pain and suffering are implicit in life because they indivisibly linked with (how did you put it?) “necessities inseparable from life itself”, but this is all based on the single equation:                xE = xG (x = variable, E = evil, G = good)** Indulge me if you will, read on. Perhaps their nominal weights are not equal in proportion. Perhaps ten absolute values of evil are worth one good! Oh, how much more convincing your argument would be! If we valued good even less than we do now in proportion to evil! But, perhaps we value good  versus evil (through out the remainder of this brief letter I will the employ examples you illustrated your piece with, happiness and pain in this case) on a more weighted scale.  Briefly (yes, once again “H”*** is absolutely yelling at me to come dance with her), let us, arbitrarily of course, assign the absolute value of one smile from a pretty girl as, oh, let’s say, ten. In logic’s assumption, we would place a polar opposite action (stubbing your toe maybe) with the same absolute value. What if, in fact, the smile’s absolute value was more akin to getting in a bicycle accident? (Remember that story! No, it wasn’t that bad, but it did create much more pain than when I last stubbed the piggy that stayed home on the end table.) You could jab a sprig of will-o-wisp in your eye every twenty minutes if, in that time between, you managed to have a decent day. I see it coming. “You only value happiness with such a weighted scale because life is so miserably dull,” or, “You try not to anticipate happiness so that the dampening effects of that anticipation do not lessen the happy moment,” or, “You don’t know what you’re talking about.” Well, as for the first two, no. If it’s that hard to internally elaborate on this short epistle, you’re fucked and you deserve all the potential misery you heaped upon yourself, let alone others. As for the last, you can go hang. Sure, you make sense, and maybe when I was a bit more misanthropic, before my over-extended cynicism was demoted to mere maniacal cynicism, I would smile when I read****  this. One time this guy told me, “Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world.” Tomato, tomato. I know all this will do is rile you up, but it’s not intended that way, honestly. I do wish I could elaborate more, but you know how it is… (Ha, maybe you don’t!) While I would like, and do intended (fully aware of my future failure to actualize this goal [a future failure in even intending at that]), to continue this line of thought at a latter date, we both know that won’t happen. If I were ever in the position to return, which would be do to lack of new stimuli and the inspiration to expound on them, then I would be much more susceptible to your point of view. A complete revision would destroy this thought. Well, take care, and write back soon. Bests, Josh.  * This is not a typo. Free your mind, think a bit looser. (Multiple moments, silly. Don’t assume linear thought!) ** This is a fault of human logic, assumptions. We assume that since these words “good” and “evil” assume polar opposition in literal terms, they also assume polar opposites in terms of the things they signify. The faultiness of human logical assessment can be expounded upon endlessly, but maybe some other time. I don’t wanna blow my load too soon. *** Happiness. **** To be read in the present tense.
