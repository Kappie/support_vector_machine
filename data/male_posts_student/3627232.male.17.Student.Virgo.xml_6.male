I arrive home in my mighty chariot I refuse to go to bed My self-induced insomnia May as well warp my head.  But I care not, for my energy is boundless! And I will stay ever awake! Sleep is not my master My will it shall never take!  So to sleep I will say, Leave me be, no time for you For I've been out late And now the day is new.
