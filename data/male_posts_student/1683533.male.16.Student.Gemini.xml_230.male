So I fall asleep at like 4, wake up at 2....to awake to fall asleep earlier....cant fall asleep till 4....wake up at 2....and so on.  Somedays I get up earlier and it still doesnt help.  I just cant sleep.  Lawrence Arms tomorrow, it is looking kinda doubtful :-/   The March Of The Elephants  is one of my favorites off of The Greatest Story Ever Told by The Lawrence Arms.  Actually, I like alot of that cd.  Still no call from evan about practice...blah
