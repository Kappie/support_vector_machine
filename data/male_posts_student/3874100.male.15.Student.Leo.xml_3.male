Ok, so it's not that bad, but anyway, 500 calories in 40 minutes ain't bad...(..well, maybe it is considering I usually put on 500 in 4 minutes, but that's not important).  As for the goldeneye, we got to the jail thing, I think it's called bunker, on secret agent and got bored, so we did some multiplayer (where I lost 12-3! - oh yeah!) and then watched some of Wrestlemania XVI, -brings back memories.  Probably going to do more excercise/guitar playing tomorow...not too exciting.    Oh yeah, bowling last night was cool, and we met this Vai/Zappa fan, who saw them 7 times, what a dude, it also turns out the barman was a Vai fan, as well as an AC/DC fan, nice, small world, eh?  And I'd like to dedicate this paragraph to the man, who first decided to get a pizza, and fill the crust with Cheese, what a man, what a genius.  Anyway, you never know, something exciting might happen tomorow...or not.  ..Jonny
