I finished off Chapter 5 of my story and now I'll have to error check it when I get some free time.  Assembly nearly sent me to sleep with Mr. Gledhill rambling on about bloody target setting and how we're going to be doing it again, grr!  Anyway, the bell finally rang and I head off home thinking "WEEKEND!!".  Got home and got ready for going to the hospital to see mum.  She looked really well and her will power is amazing!  Go mum :D!  When I got back, Dad used his Paypal to buy my domain and hosting which I should be getting any minute.  This blog is ready to switch over to it when it comes!  I'm also thinking of adding loads of other stuff to it too, and it's NOT going to be about Habbo Hotel either *phew*  Anyway, bye for now :)
