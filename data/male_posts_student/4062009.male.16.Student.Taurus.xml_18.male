But the reason why I am not happy about it either is because school starts this coming monday. :( What joy!!! (NOT!) lol!  Anyway, about Orlando. It was great!! We went to 3 parks, Universal, Islands, and Sea World within the week we had. I must say though, that the waiting in line sucked and that it was extremely hot while I was down there causing me to sweat like a dog, and I hate sweating! But other then me being a bit uncomfortable during the week, it was still rather nice to get on the rides and everthing.  I got some great footage with the video camera that I hope to soon show Grandma and Granddad, which just may happen with mom going down there for the next two weeks. Yet speaking of mom, Somthing happened over the week that I didn't expect and I am honestly not ready for.  You know how I was talking about new borns a few weeks ago, well mom is now pregnant. (And my dad hasn't even married her yet! She wants me to call her mom though so I do, thats why I am calling her mom even though she isn't quite yet.) And you know what is surprising, I too was born before my dad married my birth mother. And the chances are that this new child will be born in April, the same as when I was born. (HOLLY SH*T, that means I was concieved [SP?] in August or July! I never knew that.)  Just between you and me, I think she got pregnant on the vacation. I dare not say how though for I don't wish to think about it. We all shared the same room, this is the reason why. And really, it pisses me off if they did because they shouldn't be doing that. In fact, dad wanted to wait to tell grandma and granddad about them being pregnant, and that could be a reason why. But who knows, right. (They do, thats for sure.)  Anyway, that is my vacation in a nut shell. I will try and get some pictures of it all here if I can. Well, talk to you all later! Cya!     Wolfwood
