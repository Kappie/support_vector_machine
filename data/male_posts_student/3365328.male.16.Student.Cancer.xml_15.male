This is no bad thing as FFVII the game had enough story to fill a whole novel, and since the sequel is a film, it will be all done in pretty CGI graphics.  The flashy looking trailer, among other information, can be found here:  urlLink  www.adventchildren.net   There is also a forum suitable for obsessive fanboys/girls, so everyone is happy. But will the film have summons? ^_^
