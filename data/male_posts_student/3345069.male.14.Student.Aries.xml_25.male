       
      There is nothing to do here. Im not exagerating. No one is home so, I can't get a ride to go anywhere, no one is on AIM, and I'm sick and tired of my video and computer games. I hope to God that someone signs or my parents get home so I can go somewhere, otherwise I'm gonna have to start reading that piece of crap they call Anne Frank's Diary.
