That feeling of, "Yes, I did something constructive with my time."  What's so constructive you ask?  Well, I got some well-needed excercise, I got to work on my game, I got to completely destroy on of my friends I rarely see, and I got to play wit my bro and share some laughs.  The last thing was key, as we hardly spend time together with him working nites and sleeping in the morning and me go to work in the afternoon.  I also got to see someone I went to elementary school wit.  He was the best ball player then, and he is still amazing.  Like I wouldn't dare to play him 1on1.  He's getting some interest from some US universities, but he's going back to high school next year to  work on his game and marks.  I'm so happy for him, he's didn't fall into the many traps that high school has to offer...  I can also say that I have finally "Let it burn", tho I still wish you the best...  Matt, you said the next move is mine, so here it is... While you were still at that camp, I already forgave you.  I know it was unfair for you to get the most of my anger, but that's just how it happened.  Though I did get to see some of your truer colours.  I don't hate you, I just don't feel that urge I had before to speak to you over msn or see you outside of church.  When I see you next, I will smile and act like everything is normal, but I'm unsure whether it will be 100% sincere.  Ultimately, it was simply outside circumstances, hot tempers, and my pride that ended it.  I still read ur blog if ur wondering, and I still care.  I still think of you as a friend, tho not as highly as I once did.  Maybe one day things can be the way they were, or maybe that day will outlive us both...  On a brighter note, I can't wait for university for many reasons.  Alota ppl I know are going there, but more importantly, alot I don't.  I just really need to get that tuition paid off...  ARGH... my back hurts... ^_^ ... haha, I'ma sleep well tonite.
