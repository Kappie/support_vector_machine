I hate losing friends~ I don't really understand ... how Allah S.W.T arrange my life...how HE makes me meet with the one I can call best friends...and then take them away from me... Anyway , back to my life... I got this sms this evening which really stroke my heart ... makes me really sad... even the teachers and other drama students noticed that ...
