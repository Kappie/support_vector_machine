I re-added  urlLink Beth  and I have found the funniest people on the internet (yes funnier than the onion and OJ....although it might not be as funny as OJ's message board)....anyway Resha, Vic, Carmen, et al. write at  urlLink Kthxbi  (old AOL terminology for Ok thanks, bye....by far the worst internet slang term ever....worse than the misuse of LOL and LMAO)....check them out....very, very funny....if you don't laugh at SOMETHING there you might be legally retarded (which makes me wonder about the readership I attract)....
