Then she just left and Tyke went back to sleep.  At 11 he got his haircut for the last time before Europe and then he came back home.  He did some cleaning up of his downstairs (just a little) and talked with his mom about the trip coming up.  Then his brother and dad came home and they all talked about the trip.  Tyke made himself some split pea soup but he really hates the pull-off cans that soup comes in now.  They are such a bitch for Tyke to open.  He always opens it too strongly and spills on himself.  It's so annoying.  So he just had his dad do it today.  Lazy?  Yes.  Later on Tyke's bro decided he was going to go to REI in Redmond and Tyke decided to tag along.  Tyke got some cool boxers/boxer briefs that are like partially spandex and nylon and they are stretchy and sooooo comfortable but most importantly they are quick dry so he can wear them for Europe and just wash one pair at night and have it dry in the morning easily.  So that makes his packing a little bit easier.  He also got a stretchy fleece that is also soooo comfortable and really quite warm too.  He will probably take that with him to Europe but it will also come in handy during the cold days and nights at WSU.  College, damn that's soon.  It's so weird.  DCups was working at REI today so Tyke and him chatted for a little bit but then Tyke got his stuff and went to Borders where he got Muse's Absolution CD.  It's really good.  Tyke really likes almost every song on there.  They are an interesting sound.  Really good though, really good.  Tyke's bro got the Franz Ferdinand CD so when Tyke got home he burned a copy of that and Modest Mouse for himself and then burned Muse for his bro.  Haha, gotta love technology.  Then Tyke put on his new boxers and found out how incredibly comfy they really are.  Then he (oh yeah he was wearing the pink shirt all day) ate some food and listened to Absolution with his bro while watching TV.  At about 7:45 his cousin's and aunt and uncle (dad's side) came over.  A little graduation celebration and Europe trip send-off of sorts.  And just a chance to hang out with Tyke's older cousin who lives in New York (she could be teaching the Olsen twins next year by the way).  It was fun to talk with them and also he got $200 from them, bringing his total for the day up to $330, including the $30 the tux shop never paid him for being a rep.  So now he has made like 380 bucks for graduating.  Not bad for only getting like 4 cards.  Basically, prom spending has been nullified and then some.  After they left Tyke signed Tina's yearbook and it was sad to do.  It's starting to get sad for Tyke.  His Europe trip is going to be fun but he is going to miss seeing the girls (ok...and the guys too).  But after the party on Monday he will never see some of those people again.  The ones he really wants to see he will be able to hang out with but not nearly on the same scale.  And he really hopes to be able to hang out with friends a lot when he is here during the summer.  He really hopes so.  He fears not being able to, that is how much he wants to hang out.  Now Tyke is listening to Absolution and calming himself to the point where everything is moving in slow motion.  He is even blinking half speed.  This...is...
