Last night there was an "interesting" array of movies on cable....one of my favorite bad, bad movies, "Showgirls" was on TNT....boy oh boy where to begin with that crapfest....the script in that movie is sooooo bad that it becomes funny....like my man Bill Simmons from ESPN.com would say it rates a 100 out of 100 on the unintentional comedy scale....Glenn Plummer is at his absolute worse as the Anti-Don Cheadle....and Jesse Spano overacts her ass off....but the three best characters to me are the bitchy black dancer who gets dropped, Gina Gershon's slutty Cristal Conners with lezbo tendancies, and Jesse Spano's sexually repressed black rooommate Annie....I'm telling you if you get past all of the gratuitous nudity (which TNT does inexplicably) you have a very good bad, bad movie....  On the flipside, "Scarface" was on the History Channel....each time I watch it again I enjoy it more and more but I have a confession to make....I had never seen ANY of Scarface before this year....yes, all through high school and college I would wing it whenever Scarface references were made.....I don't know what the deal was but I had avoided Pacino flicks like the plague....hadn't seen Carlito's Way until sophomore year of college....anyway I watched it by myself the first time (I was told that was a mistake)....I didn't think it really lived up to all the hype....well having seen it a couple more times it has grown on me more and more....  Finally, I haven't done it in awhile so it's time for me to mention the top five songs of the moment for the Killa Cal  5)Oooooh This Love Is So - Al B. Sure....and I have OJ to blame for this....I listen to Al B. Sure everynight before I go to bed now thanks to this fool....  4)Spend the Night In Your Mind - Ceelo Green.....this is the best song on the best CD to come out this year in my opinion (and I've bought the most CD's this year since the summer after Freshman year in college)  3)Dangerously in Love - Destiny's Child....this song has officially entered the coveted Calvin Pantheon of Great Songs.....  2)Special Delivery (remix) - G-Dep, P. Diddy, Ghostface Killah, Craig Mack, and Keith Murray....I hated the original with a passion....but the remix is HOT....I will be buying the album "We Invented the Remix"  1)You Don't Have To Call - Usher...yep this song says so much by saying so little....I sing it in the shower, walking up the street, in class, in the car when other songs are playing....  Honorable mention goes to the Fat Joe song with Ashanti on the hook....when I install my harddrive on Monday that is the first song I will download....  Be back later!
