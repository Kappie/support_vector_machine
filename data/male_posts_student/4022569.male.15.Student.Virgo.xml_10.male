Then my moms phone rang and chase picked it up to run it out to mom. The phone call remained a mystery to chase and I. All we knew was that it was a hell of a lot of bad news. When mom finally told us the bad news. I couldn't believe what I heard. My sister in-law has condition with eyes that at some point here retina may detach and if not treated before it separates she will be blind. Prior to this phone I didn't have a clue she had any eye problems. All these images of heather walking down the street with a blind person's cane. I think things will be ok and they will be able to treat it at the hospital. Right now I know I should be crying but I'm not because I when I cry that means its hopeless. What I'm saying is that if heather is still seeing light in her tunnel then why should the light at the end of the tunnel already be out? All in all I didn't see it coming and ironically someone I'm sure someone can see the way out.
