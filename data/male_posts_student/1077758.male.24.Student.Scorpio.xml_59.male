This happened Friday at work--definitely one of the more stress inducing days we have in the grocery business.  Fortunately, everything was going smoothly this day--we weren't too busy, had a good bit of help scheduled, everything was going well.    Then Katy came in.  Katy is a girl that I get along with pretty well at work--we both have a little bit of the same sense of humor, we both pretty much hate where we work, she's going out with a guy out there who is a buddy of mine (and his brother kicks, too).  Now I had heard the stories about how she was prone to have seizures of some type before, but since she had mainly worked nights, I'd never been there for them, or even knew what sort they were.  About 10 minutes after she clocked in, she showed me her hand, shaking like a leaf in the wind. A few more minutes went on, and it kept getting worse.  I went to talk to her boyfriend to tell him about it, and we both decided that if anything happened, I'd call him and/or the manager on duty first.    I would ask her every now and then if she was okay--she was able to tell customers how much they owed, but she couldn't seem to manage to get the words out when I would ask her something.  Her eyes began hazing over, and her lower jaw would jar slightly.    I'll probably not forget what happened next as long as I live.  The shaking intensified, and she started trying to say my name over and over.  I ran to the register behind her and grabbed the microphone and called her boyfriend to the front in a calm, rational voice.  At the same time my hand left the microphone's button, she threw herself backwards onto the floor with the force of a tornado.  It was like somebody had a string tied to her neck, and they had just yanked it.  Another thing I won't forget is the sound.  Her head ricocheted off of the polished ivory tiles with a slapping sound, where she continued to shake.    I had been a foot and a half from her when this happened.  I was moving towards her, but....but I wasn't fast enough, or strong enough to do anything about it.  The eyes of the people after that...they knew I had been there, and they thought I had done nothing.    Which makes it worse, because even though I tried, I really didn't do anything.
