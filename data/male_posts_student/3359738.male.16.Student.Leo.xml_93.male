It's full of references to various elements from movies including but not limited to (and in no particular order): Spiderman, Peter Pan (hook and tinkerbell references), Mission Impossible, two characters from Beauty and The Beast, The Little Mermaid, COPS (ok, not a movie, but whatever), Godzilla, El Zorro, Alien, Lord of the Rings, Sleepy Hollow, Jurassic Park, and probably more which I don't recall. (I haven't really spoiled you anything yet, since I haven't told you what the actual references are.) There's  urlLink soooooo many .  It's also slightly musical, as it includes musical songs from the  Fairy Godmother  ( urlLink Jennifer Saunders ) and  Donkey  ( urlLink Eddie Murphy ) with  Puss In Boots  ( urlLink Antonio Banderas ). Also, Tom Waits, disguised as a character I shant mention for the sake of not spoiling it for you, sings songs in a bar in the movie.  Actually, now that I think of it, I wonder if  Shrek 2  is the first CG movie to ever feature a musical scene (where the characters sing themselves and stuff).  There's also a number of gags involving the  urlLink store names , such as a "Burger Prince".  Oh, by the way, if you go see it, when the credits start, stay on your seat, 'cause there's an extra bit featuring Donkey. (If I gave any more info I would spoil it for you.)  Lastly, seeing how well the animation was done, I look forward to seeing PDI-DreamWorks' next CG film,  urlLink Shark Tale  (also featuring a great cast of voices). Oh yea, I suppose you know DreamWorks is owned by  urlLink Spielberg ?
