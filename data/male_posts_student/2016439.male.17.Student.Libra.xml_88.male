Thankfully I've managed to keep you at bay for some time now, but I see you ripping apart relationships all around me. Go away and die, or something to that extent. Were you tangible, I'd take you by the scruff of your neck and box your ears. Yes, box them because you don't deserve a modern punishment since you're no modern entity. You're old. You're  so  old. You've torn apart ancient empires, brought the downfall of presidents, and brought out world to the brink of destruction. Do us all a favor and bother the Martians for a while...but then come back. I guess without you we would never progress. That's stupid. Yeah, okay, so we have to have you, but could you at least back off a bit? Life is complicated enough as it is. Just let me rest for a while, okay? 'preciate it.
