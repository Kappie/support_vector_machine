Do you understand that what David Kay is saying is not the same thing that the media is reporting?  I'm conflicted, because I feel like I need to go into the whole WMD issue in depth, but I don't want to.  Mostly because in my mind it is perfectly clear that we did the right thing.  I still think WMD activities were going on, and much of it is in Syria or the Becca Valley (according to the Mossad).  They will turn up some day.  But even with the WMD absence, there were another thousand reasons why the Iraqi war was justified.  We did the right thing, and if I need to, I'll go into that.  Just let me know if you want to hear it.
