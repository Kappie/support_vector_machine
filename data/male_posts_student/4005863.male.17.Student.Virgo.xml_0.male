They are not high paid prostitutes as many people seem to thing. They had honor and respect. I really would love to meet some real Geisha when I go to Japan. Ha, I honestly don't believe I would ever have enough money though. Perhaps one day. Today I haven't done that much. I have just been spending time with my mom and brother. I know my mom and brother are going to miss me a lot when I leave. I know mom wishes I didn't leave the state, but I just know that this is the right path. I mean it was like a sign when I heard of Wittenberg. It was last summer, and I received a pamphlet from them, and they knew about my interest in Japan. I still don't know to this day how they found a guy in a small town in Alabama, because they don't have a single student from Alabama. It has to be destiny. Well that is all for today. Take care everyone and God Bless.
