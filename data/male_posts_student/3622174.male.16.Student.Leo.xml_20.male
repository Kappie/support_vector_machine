This new blog is dedicated to the internet, computers, and anything you can do with them.  Sorry guys, can't post porn, so don't even ask.  Every day, check out BagelTech for the hottest inside tips and tricks, including links and reviews to websites, games, downloads, and more, and its all free.  Then, if you like what you see, head over to The Blog of the Bagel and tell me what you think in the message board.    Later today, I'll have a couple of reviews and things, so be sure to check it out later.  This blog will update two or three times a day, not sure, but, be sure to check it out.  Everything will be able to be found in the archives, too, if you missed out on it the first time, and I'll end every week on Saturdays with a review of what I saw this week, telling you what I thought was best, and what I thought was worst.  Here is my ratings system, just so you care:  0- This is probably not worth your attention. 1- Boring, but may interest boring people. 2- Alright, maybe worth checking it out. 3- Definitely worth a look. 4- Very interesting, maybe worth bookmark material. 5- The best of the best, and shouldn't be missed by anyone who uses the internet.  Why do I have two blogs now?  Its easy...I'm bored.  And I know that a lot of other people are bored, too.  That's why I am committed to updating my blogs on a regular basis.  The reasons?    1. Like I said, I'm bored, and others are bored. B. The internet has so much to offer, so why not help people find stuff? 3. I want that freakin' Gmail invite!  Today, I'll be getting right to work and finding the best internet stuff out there.  Expect at least two reviews, the download of the day, and more.  There will be at least three posts here today, and at least two at The Blog of the Bagel, so, as you can probably tell, I've got something to do now.  Enjoy BagelTech.
