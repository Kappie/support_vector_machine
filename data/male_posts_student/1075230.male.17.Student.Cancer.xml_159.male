Well, i just read Jade-chan's dream. and since she has no "comment" thingies, i decided to type in here....ummm interesting dream Jade! im just wondering...hmmm y u didnt at least TRY to climb the rock. i mean, it sort of seemed like it was ur mission....to relate this to real-life, id have to say ..that maybe the rock represents a challage and the "ghost"/"demon" is ur pressure to complete the challange. in the dream, u choose wat u feel like is that way to b "free" from this "responsibility" (or the "rock"), so instead of climbing the rock, u face wat u feel is the inetivable, to die. (or to fail) but u think that ull b free from the ghost (the pressure) once a decision has already been made, and this decision seemed to b easier then tiring urself climbing the rock. once u die, though, things r not as they seem, and the ghost/demon (or the "pressure") follows u even after ur false freedom. so....possibly this could b a warning, or, it could even b something that has already happened. As for ur family, i think this decision also affects them, they and the priests and nuns, (the "good" people) expect this from u, (as the nun expected u to climb the rock) but they probably werent the ones causing the pressure....hmmm think on that, tell me wat u think, and ill tell u more.
