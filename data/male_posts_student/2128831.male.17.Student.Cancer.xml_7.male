Ohhhh, and I got some braclets they are great!  ANd, that make me happy as well.  Ohhh, and Jared talked to me!!!! *squeals* His interview is at like 3pm in Califfornia, so like 7pm here.  I hope he makes it.  That would add to my happiness.  So, all of these things make me happier then a penguin on some ecsasty after breakin' into the research center in the South Pole.  Woot, woot!  Go Lynnhaven Mall you rock my socks!  So, Jared gets another package from me, yep, yep as sure as ice melts!
