(Can I say "black kid?" or is it rude? Oh well.) Apparently the kids used to hit him, pee on him, call him gay, and so forth.  But what I find interesting is this quote from a news piece about it:  Daryl, who cried at his sentencing hearing Wednesday, says kids at his school are still making fun of him daily even after all that he's been through.  "Most of the time they call me white," said Daryl, who is black. "It's better than what they were calling me before. But I've learned not to deal with them." So apparently "white" is better than "gay." I think I'm happy to hear that? Still, I don't like the fact that "white" is an insult to a black guy. I wouldn't be insulted if somebody called me "black." I guess the spectrum, then, is as follows:  Gay --> White --> Black  Okay. I'm glad we got that straightened out.
