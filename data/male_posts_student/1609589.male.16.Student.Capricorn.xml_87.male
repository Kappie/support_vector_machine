This shit shouldn't be allowed to go on any more.  Let me quote something i said during a conversation just a minute ago---  ShuChoMouff: people on this show get their bones broken, teeth smashed in, one game involves the contestant getting starved for 3 days, then have to gather more food than anyone else.  Should we allow this to go on? I say... NAY!!! Bomb japan! Stop this shit!
