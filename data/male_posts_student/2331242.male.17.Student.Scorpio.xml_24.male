And if you call, I will answer And if you fall, I’ll pick you up And if you court this disaster I’ll point you home  You think I only think about you When we’re both in the same room You think I’m only here to witness The remains of love exhumed You think we’re here to play A game of who loves more than whom  And if you call, I will answer And if you fall, I’ll pick you up And if you court this disaster I’ll point you home
