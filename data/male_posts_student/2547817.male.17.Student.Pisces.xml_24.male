It really intrigues me that so many people in my college have coloured eyes. Like a friggin rainbow. Yellow, blue, green, grey. The problem is, that the pigments don't really boost one's image. Not in my sight at least. On the other hand, I might consider it a sign of weakness. One of insecurity. Why not be who you are. presenting yourself to people without having to hide behind a pseudo-image. Being hip and trendy, funky and posh? Give me a friggin break lah. It somes from the inside. People will see it. Fell it. If you're reading this, I sincerely hope it speaks to you.  On the other hand, there was this one exceptional case. She's got hazel eyes. They're natural. What is it with me and this word "hazel"?! Stunningly beautiful. Truly, I am at a loss for words. She is an ordinary Jane, but those eyes... Couple that with a debaitor's mind and... I shall stop here...  She's nice.. reminds me of Claire abit. Oh well. My heart is still somewhere in hillview, in a 7-story house, in the pocket of another debaitor. Then again, what is it with me and debaitors!?  Goodness!
