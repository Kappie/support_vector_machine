I missed the front part of the show where they held games in their studio, but I manage to catch the last segment of the show where by the hosts helps people sort out their relationships. Today’s situation starts off with an army man wanting to check out on his girlfriend, to see if she’s seeing another guy. So the hosts went on a spying trip following the girl around. For three continues days, the hosts keep seeing the same old guy hang out with the girl, fetching her off from work, going out for dinner even buying her jewelry. They even spotted the girls best friend (another girl) quarreling with both the older guy  her. Poor army guy got a breaking up call from the girl his following off day. And the hosts showed him all the video they had capture and also asked his ex’s best friend out. And she reviewed that his ex’s is actually seeing someone else. The girl was asked to hold a meeting with army man’s ex and the army man, the host and the rest of the crew sits in another room watching the happening via a pinhole cam. What they didn’t expect was army man’s ex brought along that older guy, who army man discovered was his cousin. Is that messy or what? Army man wanted to pick up a fight but the crew stopped him. The army man ask his cousin to take care of his ex while he was serving his country, and sure enough he did (a little too much). And that best friend of his ex was actually helping him. Are we talking about a 4 way relationship here? I don’t know. There’s two things to conclude here, #1 its hard to maintain a relationship when a guy is serving the army and #2 there are other’s who care. =)  Ok so the show was over, and I took a little nap until 8pm. That’s when Tara’s sister, Keshia, greeted me with a BIG ‘BOO’. I thought it was fun so I ask where she got the add-on. It’s  urlLink  here , go try it out… HEhee… So I kinda play with the add-on programme, drawing panda’s, instant emoticons and even tracing out doreamon (and I kena condemned by Tara for insulting her hero). It’s not easy using a mouse to write and draw, just wait till I get myself a stylus. Yeah, and soon it was time to watch THE EYE on channel 8. It was my first time watching, but I thought it was kind of funny, I can’t help but to laugh with I saw a female ghost licking her husband’s char shew. And also when I saw the ghost on the train. Back in front of my com, we (Tara, Keshia  me) held a little gundam seed conversation in Keshia’s Blog. Funny sia, I have no other comments on that. Hehee… WHAT WILL KIRA YAMATO DO NEXT? Stay tuned~
