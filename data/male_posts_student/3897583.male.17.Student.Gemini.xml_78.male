When we reached St. Xavier’s School after a 90-minute drive (and a lot of direction-asking on part of Mr. Goswami), we were told by their teachers that we cannot participate as we did not send our registration by Fax. We knew of this, and hence, two days earlier Hema Jain Ma’am had called up their Head of Operations and informed him of the situation. He had told her that on-the-spot registrations were allowed and that we need not send the form now. However, their teachers there did not care to listen. I called up Hema Ma’am and explained to her what was going on around here; since all their teachers had scurried inside, we got their President to talk to her on the phone.  This person was extremely rude to her on the phone and denied that their members gave any such information to her (outright lying), telling her that she must have misunderstood and that it’s not really his problem.   There was no longer any reason to stay there and talk to these people. I have never seen a school so insolently and disrespectfully treat a guest school, not to mention their teacher. They certainly haven’t heard the “ Mehman Bhagwan ” saying. I would like to request our Principal to ban their school from participating in not only all Exun events this year, but also all DPS events in general (and if Mukesh Sir permits, I’ll write her a letter myself).  I would also like to make a final note that at least three people, namely Sanchit Bhatia, Arjun Agarwala and Shrinjan Khosla had sat and prepared hard for this competition and it was very painful to disappoint them in such a way.  A highly disgruntled Karan signing off.
