My favorite part is that she has a "cancer problem" but that doesn't worry her, her real concern is her "stroke sickness."  So if you get something interesting in your inbox please forward it to  urlLink me , and put "fun junkmail" in the comments field.  Yes, I want more junkmail.  But please, only if it is fun, different, interesting or otherwise noteworthy.  None of the typical, "please her" or "male enhancement-naturally!" emails.  And nothing that is going to get me arrested for having it on my computer.  Unless it's really funny.
