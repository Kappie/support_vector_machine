George and I will be packing the car up and shipping our asses back to Vegreville this afternoon, where I will then proceed to gorge myself on Christmas treats and honeyed hams -  whole  hams - for two consecutive days. During this time, the gang (which would include an assortment of chums and buddies) will attempt to throw together a road hockey game of monumental proportions, if for no other reason than to burn off the turkey stuffing and make way for Turtles, Toffifee, and Ferrero Roche, er, Fer...ro...F...ah, whatever. I just pretend they're little chocolate planets, while I,  Unicron , greedily devour their inhabitants one morsel at a time.  I would divulge the rest of my holiday plans, but the United States of America has descended in to Yellow, no Blue, no, shit!,  ORANGE ALERT , and I must observe a state of "increased awareness." I'd sure hate for some uber-Grinch terrorists to rain Anthrax down on my merry festivities.    Currently: Wondering why I didn't go to bed 7 hours previously
