You'd have thought that, what with me being retired and all, that I'd have decades full of time, perhaps enough time to fill the void that is Mullanals head - but that's a long shot. However, I've been out virtually all day picking up my suit from Nicholas Smith's - I've just tried it on to show Nan and Grandad and it fits very nicely - and then being driven around random places by Grandma for her manicure and to develop her pictures from her fancy new digital camera. It IS the best one ever!! I am SO going to steal it off her for the Prom Night... Mwuahahaha! Anyway, after this exciting journey through perpetual boredom Johnson invited me up to his and he spent basically an entire hour telling me that he thought my mum was hot, he also told me that he wouldn't mind getting a peice of somebodies muff - but unfortunately, I'm not allowed to reveal that it's Da... lol. Okay, so because of my tiring day I haven't got time to go and blogg something interesting, sorry Steph but I'm going to be even more boring than usual today :(. I'm going to post this and then maybe "steal" off with another cartoon using Google... Have fun 'ye all! Martin J.
