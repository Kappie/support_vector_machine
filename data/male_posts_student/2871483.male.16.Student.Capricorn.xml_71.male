I've been hurting since i've bought the gimmick About something called love Yeah, something called love. Well, that's like hypnotizing chickens.  Well, I'm just a modern guy Of course, i've had it in the ear before I have a lust for life 'cause of a lust for life  I'm worth a million in prizes With my torture film Drive a GTO Wear a uniform All on a government loan I'm worth a million in prizes Yeah, I'm through with sleeping on the sidewalk No more beating my brains No more beating my brains With liquor and drugs With liquor and drugs.  -  Starlight Parade was a blast.  Rain made it even better.  Best parade I've ever been in.  First off, I get there a little early, but I got to miss a bit of the practicing due to something with my uniform.  Next, this simple, easy busride.  Listened to some tunes.  Arrived in downtown portland (we parked in front of a porno arcade) and walked to our warmup spot.  Where we waited.  We were supposed to have waited for about a half an hour.  That half an hour turned into an hour, and then an hour and a half.  All fine with me, I just talked with people, had some fun.  When the parade actually got going, I saw my parents came!  I'm like, "No way!  They actually made it to a parade!!".  Definately cool.  Parade starts for us, so, of course, it starts raining.  Rain felt very, very, very good.  It was great.  The whole parade just went well.  Bus ride kinda sucked, I was crammed in with a bunch of people.  -  I'll post later.
