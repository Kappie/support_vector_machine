I do have to say I love life, and all the people in it. My life long motto would be "Live Life one day at a time." Original Huh? I live with my Parents Dan and Denise, with the addition of a sister ( Katie.) I have two life long best friends ( Meghan and Katelyn.) And they are really cool to be with. My most recent friends I have made were Sari and Chris ( co-workers.) Now all of the Visitor Services staff ( and Zoo employee staff ) have been really nice, and are also friends. Sari and Chris are just my two Best Freind Zoo buddies.     Now this would be a Blog without telling what happened today!       August 19, 2004    Today I woke up to cloudy Pittsburgh weather, I though I was going to have the day off, but little did I know that it wasnt supposed to rain untill later that night. So I had to rush at like 10:10 am to be able to get to work at like 11 a.m. Finnaly I was ready and my cousion drove me to work. Well today I had to work on CoGo's Sumatran Express ( its alil train thing that is an attraction for Zoo visitors.) Well I love the train to death...but today was not it's day. I was tried the dumb thing kept smoking and it rained twice so we had to shut it down two times. Well me Phil ( Train Driver ) and Chris ( Read^Above) got our luck when we did'nt have to take it to the barn, then walk back. It rained very heavy for about an hour and is still drizzling as I type. Again thats Pittsburgh Weather. Anyways I have to go right now, beacuse I work tommorow again on the Train.... Please Let It Rain!
