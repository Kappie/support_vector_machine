One thing I've learned (especially in Raw Deal) is that life is not fair.   THIS FONT IS FUCKING HUGE AND IT MARKS THE BEGINNING OF THE RANT ZONE!  IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ MY ENDLESS RANTING, THEN SKIP TO THE END OF THE RANT ZONE   So I got banned from TCO... again.  I have no problem with being banned, but the REAL problem I have is with AntiGoth and HalfBadger.  The main reason they are admins is because they're Rob Dean's best friends.  Understandable, but sometimes you just can't give your friends what they want and you have to pick mods/admins that do the job correctly.  AntiGoth and HalfBadger both said if links were sent in, they'd   reprimand (ha fucking vocab fucks)   the flamer/post whore/whoever.  Sooooo HalfBadger was on AIM the other day and I instant messaged him.  I don't have the exact IM anymore, but this is how it went:  J: Hey, I found some grade a flaming on TCO HB: Show me J: Link HB has signed off (signifying a ban)  Right.  They care.  MY ASS.  I could send them 5000 links, but they'd just say "Whatever, it's not you flaming/post whoring/breaking the rules, therefore we don't care".  Let me inform you all of why I have to say I was banned from TCO   again   and why I'm just not "banned from TCO"  Back in the day, there was a user by the name of Gareth.  After a little Joe/Gareth/Untouchables Flame war, it wound up that I (and only I) was banned for a month.  Amazing, isn't it?     I   was the only one banned.   Fast forward a little bit, Dictator/Gareth hack TCO, I get banned again, but this time Kevin Bunker says "I had a desire to hack TCO with the dictator"...  what the shit?  I hated dictator, why would I want to hack TCO?  Fast forward a very long time, to when the Raw Deal CCGPro patch comes out.  Me and David Klein set up forums and everything and stuff is going fine and dandy.  One of the admins from TCO, Jarrod "AmericanNightmare" Westerfield registered at our forums.  After a brief period of time, Doyvid found out that you could access people's passwords, and he eventually went on Jarrod's TCO account, deleted all of the forums, and then started accusing me.  Trust me, Doyvid, I know you were accusing me.  I was in the chat room you were doing it in.  Luckily I had a friend online when it started happening (I wasn't online at the time, I was off sleeping or something)  Anyways, he tells me what's going on, I hide out for a few days, and after the smoke cleared I took the blame.  What the hell, I was already being blamed anyways, and I was already banned so why would I care?  Fast forward a lot more to this Summer.  Dealers is about to go on air, and I have a little chat with RVD in a chat room for Dealers.  We talk and RVD unbans me.  Yay.  So I start posting on TCO again.  For those of you who don't visit TCO: That place is a hellhole now.  Right after all of the spoilers came out, everyone started trying to make "Potentially Broken" (yet even more potentially shitty) combos.  Then there's the dumbasses who can't put together a simple sentance let alone spell some of the simplest words (career?  carrier?  what the fuck?)  Besides that, there's the people who don't RTFCs.  If you don't read the fucking cards, don't talk about them!  End of that section of rant.  Even Team SRB sucks nowadays.  SRB used to be the coolest, now it sucks because they let all these stupid dipshits in.  I have been thinking about it while writing this, and I decided I will say it.  Ezzy ruined SRB.  That's all I have to say on that topic.  Then, there's the TCO politics.  If you ask Nick Chehi why he left, he'll tell you it's because of this.  At least that's what he told me.  Rob Dean isn't willing to scold any of his mods/admins when they break the rules.  Don't even get me started on their moderation/administration staff.  So, back to why I started ranting, life is not fair.  TCO is not fair.  The Forums are not fair.  In the end , Team Fear the Mullet will just be discriminated against.  There's no end to it.  The only end is a bullet.  Just kidding.  I hit my 3 strikes.  Hell, I'm SURE the Untouchables reached their three strikes SEVERAL times.  Let's start a Tally:  BJ of the Untouchables ----------- "I don't claim to be a member of 14 different teams in my sig and I don't act like a bitch when someone else is having fun. I believe that being a part of a RD team means something and I don't go throwing it around like "I'M IN TAEM POOPIE PNATS" eff you, idiot. I and my teammates are just requesting something that isn't likely to happen IN HOPES THAT IT WILL - stop trying to rain on my parade you rim jobbin' fecal slut." - Direct flame towards me (SuperRad) on the post....  urlLink http://www.teamcanadaonline.ca/tcoforum/thread-view.asp?threadid=18103=26posts=34   FalconX2 ---------- "Hellz Yes Hard Times!" - Post whoring on  urlLink http://www.teamcanadaonline.ca/tcoforum/thread-view.asp?threadid=18682posts=13   THEY'RE EACH AT ONE STRIKE!  OH LORDY  I don't feel like ranting on, so  THIS IS THE END OF THE RANT ZONE, AND YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE IT IS SYMBOLIZED BY THIS HUGE FUCKING TEXT (  motherfuckers  )   So I built a Cheap Pops/Plunge/Mono-Grapple Dude Love.  It's sexy.
