It was a bit warm, the time of day that most Coachella Valley residents take refuge in their homes.  Lo and behold I got there and a large Latino family was at the range.  And none of them had ever hit a golf ball.  I'm relatively new to golf and remember the time when I first tried to hit a ball.  I remember going to driving ranges, insecure and embarassed about my ability (or lack thereof) to hit the fucking ball.  I remember the sly smiles of those witnessing my folly.  No one ever said anything.  Golf is a very odd sport with way too many rules.  There is an unwritten rule in golf etiquette:  Never, ever offer advice on how to play.  I'm not sure why this is such an important tenet of the "gentile" sport but I'm guessing it has something to do with superstition.  I'm betting that most golfers wouldn't dare to offer advice lest it somehow come back to haunt them on their next tee shot.  F that.  Something in me just wanted to reach out to this family, give them a few pointers and help them enjoy this game a little bit more.  I spent about 15 minutes showing them the very basics of a good golf swing.  Many in the family had played baseball.  I could tell because when they swung the club, they led with their hips.  In golf, one must learn to delay the forward rotation of the hips to coincide with the movement of the trunk.  My new friends took quickly and kindly to this unsolicited lesson.  Especially the younger ones.  The father sent the oldest child back into the clubhouse to get more range balls to hit.  They had the fever.  As for me, I still can't hit my 3-wood straight.  All my friends pretend not to notice.
