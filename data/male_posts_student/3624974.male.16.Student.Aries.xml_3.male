Whos Rockapella you ask? well, remember that show  Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego ? they were the people that did all the singing on that. So when we figured I'd have the whole day off we schedualed my drivers test. It twas this morning at 10:30. I passed. I have my license. How fuckin cool is that eh?
