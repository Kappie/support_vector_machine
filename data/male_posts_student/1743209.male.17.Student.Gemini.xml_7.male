A bit corny, I know.  Anyway, so a quick crashcourse for you all into what's going on in my life at the mo, so you are up to speed with what i'm going on about:  I am 17, and currently doing my A Levels (Maths, Physics, ICT and Product Design). This combination of subjects is not as daunting as it looks (for some mad reason, I have elected to carry on all 4 subjects next year), although, time will tell. Also,  My AS results come out on August 19th.     So, moving on. This summer holiday, I have got next to no coursework to do, so I have mainly been chilling out. The main events of this holiday so far consist of buying an iPod for myself, and seeing mates (I definately recommend an iPod to anyone whos' thinking about it!). My main targets this holiday consist of doing as little work as possible, as next year at school is gonna be one long slog.  Finally, in this first post, when i am not upto my eyeballs in schoolwork, I spend most of my free time listening to music, and playing my electric guitar (A Squier Bullet Strat in navy blue). I got it in October 2002, and since then I have gotten pretty good at it (It helps that I played the violin for 8 years before learning guitar). I like to write songs in my spare time, although unfortunately, I'm not good at singing, so I tend to concentrate on the tune first (rythym, lead, solos etc) and then write the lyrics.  Anyway, I've rambled enough for today. Talk tommorow!
