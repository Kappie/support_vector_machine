Friday   Ahh! Friday! The last day of the weekidays and the start of the weekends. Well, at least after midnight anyway. Heh. Anyhoo, what happened today ar? Loads. Okie...I forgot what happened at school la. Got Chem lecture (where Mrs Tay suddenly ran out, which we all presume to vomit), GP (boring) and MT (not-really-boring).  After school is where fun begins. Okay. We've got a long day ahead of us. Our group is going down to this Teachers' Network to interview Dr Sumarta for our PW. First, we had to wait for Kelvin to finish his Parent-Teacher Meeting wtih Tham.   He came out with horror stories to share. Apparently, Tham had bad things to say about him. He 'attacked' KL using PW, saying that Kelvin could drag us down. O.O Even ducks meow!   Okay. It was onwards to the Teachers' Network. We took 190 to Orchard, then we went onto Orchard Boulevard. All thanks to the lousy map my father drew, we effectively got lost! LOST! We eventually have to hire a cab there, which was what my father suggested in the first place. Ergh.   Okay. The interview went rather well. Yep. We got rather a lot of info. One thing I must admit. I was very shocked when I met Dr Sumarta. She turned out to be woman. I always thought she was a 'he'! How surprising is that? Very! Yeah. She was friendly and great to work with. :D  Ahh...leaving the building is a terrible crime. You know what? I led the whole group to one big round finally walking opposite the Teachers' Network building. By then, I was terribly rushed. I have to go back, change, get moolah and meet my friends at 6:30. Die la! Do you know that it is very hard to flag a taxi at Grange road? Stupid right? Ergh... We spent about 10 minutes trying to get a damn cab! In the end, we got one la...  Haiyah! No time to go back to change clothes le. I have to rush to 768 in the end to get dinner moolah from Father. Sigh.   Okay. I met CQ and Gao Luan in Woodlands MRT. We then met Gloria on the train, and onwards we go to YCK station!  We met HL and HM at the station. We were fashionably late. As in 7.10+. We hurried over to AJ, then to the Auditorium. Wow! It was packed full! Lcukily, we managed to find a row of seats at the top.  The performance was great. I liked the Phantom of the Opera the best! tum-tum-tum-tum..... Even Joyce is meowingly good. At least, from what I cna see la. I remembered that in between the first and second song, she spaced out. Everyone brought their harmonicas to their lips, but she was staring into blank space. I was like O.O Then she remembered and the music began. HAHAHA! Still, she put up an excellent performance.   Okay. We went to 167 in Marsiling to eat dinner. O.O GL hor...likes to hao lian. Ayioh...hao lian about poly life. He also expects to go to the concert for free. O.O He thought SL paid le ma. Well, SL didn't pay for her ticket, but PY did. So it's like PY wasted her $5..and GL should pay. He seems to reluctant to pay, and when he tells Joyce that he's paying, he said like "I pay lor, to save you all the trouble". What the?? Anyhoo...after diner I went back with Gloria.   Yeah. Came back, bathed, read TNP and slept.   Today   Okie dokie. I woke up at 8, meowed and mooed till 10. I have to go mmet Tham ma. I was like very nervous. What if he says a lot of negative stuff about me? I hope I didn't do anything. Heh.  Right. We reached school at 11. Woah...We saw Yih Fei waiting, and he said that he waited for an hour le. HaHa. I found out that Siva was here in PJ too! She was in the TLDDS and is here for the Tmail Soc thingy. Hehheh. I was chatting with her, catching up with old times, until Yih Fei was free.   Hmmm. It didn't went as badly as I thought. Basically, the good points that come out of it is that he said my grades show that I am slowly adjusting stably and that I am a good student. Yeah. Meow moo.  After that I went to Admiralty Place to eat lunch with parents. After that leh, I met Gloria at Woodlands.  We went to Woodlands Library to do homework. Today was really productive, because I completed my Tutorial 10a (Basic Differentiation)! So easy! HaHa...actually I had problems only in the First Principle. Other than that, I love differetiation. Gloria helped me with my Physics Question 10. HaHa. I helped her too. Meow moo!   After that, Gloria have to go meet her friend, while I went to Popular to buy a book on punctuation. It's called "Eats, Shoots  Leaves", in which the title is basically a deliberate punctuation mistake in itself, if you saw the panda on the cover. Did you discover the mistake? Tell me about it in the comments! Such a nice book! Punctuation is important! A book of zero tolerance. HaHa!  Okay. Coming back was Internet and meows. Yeah. I think I gotta be going. See ya later! TaTa! Night blog!
