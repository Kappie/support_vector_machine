From the Simpsons: Marge: Homer, the plant called and they say if you don't come to work today, don't bother coming in on Monday. Homer: Woohoo! 4 day weekend!  Yea, but anyways, I got work today and I really wanted to see the Day After Tomorrow which comes out today.  If anybody wants to see it contact me, cause I want to too.  I made an "Other" section on the sidebar.  You can have some fun clicking around there, more links will be up.  A note about the Michigan Hardcore link though: it isn't just hardcore, it features alot of people in different types of bands.  You can check out classified ads there for people looking for bands or musicians for Michigan bands, and some other stuff.  I got to take a shower bye.
