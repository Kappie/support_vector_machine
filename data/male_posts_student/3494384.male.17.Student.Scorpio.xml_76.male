We walk around looking for the place. After that Kenneth arrived. Went eating. KFC. Saw some freaking Indians. They stinks. I saw them ordering food and they keep requesting that soft drink dont want ice and what only want the biggest chicken. They have totally no face at all.  Was quite happy to meet Kenneth larhz. Some catching on about what's happening and such.   There is a theme park near the event. Try one of the ride. It was quite fun. Fast and exciting lorhz. Some fast technp music and spinning action.  Never did I know that we need to queue to get in the event until i call Vincent up. He sort of make me angry today. Shant go in details larhz... Saw 1 very familar girl. She and her friends keep looking at my direction and was like talking about me. I guess she remember me too. Dont know why I know her face only but still I'm not sure if she's my primary school friend or what. Nevetheless, queuing was fast and quite fun. Some people went selling this pen which will flash light. Then we decide to buy it.  Went in. Sat waiting for 2 hours plus. The thingy was postpone from 9 to 9.30. Damn it. The whole stage was like very well done and the screen was playing MVs all the time to keep us occupied. Mostly is Energy's and SHE's one. Quite good lorhz. Though the wait was long and there's this guy who keep sitting with his leg open and that really irritates me.  Was like joking and chatting around. At 8.30, the Fireworks starts. It was DAMN NICE. How I wish to see it again... Maybe next year bahz... :D Hopefully someone will be by my side by that time. :D  Finally the thingy starts, dont really remember much cuz I dont feel like remember it larhz. Just remember about Toro's part. He's still as good looking and kawaii!!! So huggable de lorhz... He sang pratically every song in the Xue Tian Shi OST and he sang 'Give It Up'. One of the newest song of his. Later he sang a new song not yet broadcast anywhere with Yan Xing Shu. Quite nice. Find that Toro actually have a great body worz... :P  Yan Xing Shu is ok. No comments. K-One is ok. They sang well. They did manage to impress me. R  B is ok too. New band named TaiChi is absurd. All guys and their specialty is GongFu. They did impressive jumps and such. They really impress me besides for their name. All of their name starts with the word 'Tai'. What the hell...  Cyndi is good. Yue Guang was the song I always wanted her to sing live. She did sang it and it was good. Her 'Dang Ni' dont know for what reason make me cry. All because of my ex larhz.   Didnt watch 5566 cuz I ran out after I find myself crying. What the fuck... Kenneth and Patrick follow suit. Went home taking the last train.  By the way, my HP is siaoz onez... On and off service.   I'm tired le...
