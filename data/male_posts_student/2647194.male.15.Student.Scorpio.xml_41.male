Played starcraft, ate lunch, and did homework to whittle away the time until the evening. Then...the underground!!! (that was the best time I've ever had there!)  A little odd timing issue: Nikki, Amanda, and I all left for the Underground right when Dylan and his family arrived for dinner. The three of us proceeded to arrive back when Dylan's family was leaving. wierd.  It's getting really late...I mean its 12:34-on-a-Sunday-morning late, and I have to rise bright and early for church. In other words, I gotta crash. lol.  Again, I'll leave you all with a lyric, this time from a Queen song.  "Oooh you make me live Whatever this world can give to me, It's you, you're all I see Oooh you make me live now honey, Oooh you make me live   Oh you're the best friend that I ever had,  I've been with you such a long time  You're my sunshine and I want you to know That my feelings are true, I really love you   Oh you're my best friend, Oooh you make me live  Oh I've been wandering round, but I still come back to you In rain or shine, you've stood by me girl  I'm happy at home, you're my best friend   Oooh you make me live  Whenever this world is cruel to me, I got you to help me forgive Oooh you make me live now honey, Oooh you make me live   You're the first one, when things turn out bad  You know I'll never be lonely, you're my only one  And I love the things, I really love the things that you do You're my best friend, Oooh you make me live  I'm happy at home, You're my best friend  Oh you're my best friend, Oooh you make me live  You're my best friend"
