My grandmother taught me how to play it when I was 5 or 6, but I decided not to continue it. Now I'm regreting that decision. Wouldn't you wish that you could just turn back time and correct your mistakes? ... I would.  I've been lacking sleep recently. Mainly because of stubborness and laziness. I could do my homework immediately after I come home from school, instead, I just bum around... even though I've got tons of homework to do. Cramming has just grown on me ever since the first day of school. I could do my homework right away, I know I'm perfectly capable of doing it... it's just that I'm too stubborn to do just that.   I'm a very lazy person, sometimes I'm even too lazy to go to sleep(weird right)... to get ready for sleep actually. For atleast 30 minutes, I'm just on my bed lying down... when I could have that 30 minutes for sleep, instead I just lie down. Sometimes I'm not even thinking while just lying down, just staring blankly into space as if I have no feelings, like an inanimate object. I want to get rid of it, but I just got used to doing it. It's one of my bad habits that I want to get rid of, especially cramming.  That's my eight post so far, I hope whoever is reading didn't find it weird, I was just thinking of things to post so I'm sorry if you didn't like it...
