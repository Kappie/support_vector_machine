After yesterday's heavy downpour, it rained at almost exactly the same time today, albeit for a much shorter time. It's very humid and wet. The pathways in IIML are not very rain-friendly and water-logging is a problem. It cuts out some routes temporarily. Plus the stones used for paving are also slippery to my sandals, whose grip has been smoothened. So I have to walk slowly and carefully.
