Hanon  - 1-4 @ mm. 120, personally I think 4 still needs a little work. 5 @ mm 112, it was ok, gave my fingers a workout. 6 is really bad on the way down! 7 is hands separate and way too hard! :)  Cadences  - All are becoming easier! C  G in first inversion are coming along. C is really good, but G is h-a-r-d, because the F# keeps throwing me.  Technic (book)  - Ah inversions, how I loathe thee. But yet I still practice them. Ms. Rhonda says that they'll become easier. Obviously not today! My left hand is weak though.  Piano (book)  - Reveille is coming along better, now that I'm hitting the "turn" notes. Thanks for pointing that out Ms. Rhonda. Moving the evil inversions are still slowing me down though.  Spinning Song (performance piece)  - I'm really enjoying this piece. I just have to get used to counting it (1 e  a). I think I can do it though.
