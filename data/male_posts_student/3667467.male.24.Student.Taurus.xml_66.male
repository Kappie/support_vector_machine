Then again, at least they can be in public places, unlike Iran, and at least they can walk, unlike pre-colonial China. Still, one out of every five women in America are victims of sexual assault. So while I was going to start off this post by saying "Why are people so paranoid?" I've rationalized a bit more. Here's the problem, however. I'm a very fast walker, and it has made me look like a ravenous predator. At places like the college campus or anywhere with a sidewalk, it seems, I have somewhere to go while the women walking half a block in front of me apparently do not. This means that at some point I will pass them. Now sure, they might hear footsteps coming behind them, but it's even more possible that women have a sixth sense that a lone young male is coming up behind them, even from forty yards. (Maybe they have eyes in the back of their head, just like mom!) I instantly become a threat. You will observe the quick "I'm turning my head slightly but I'm not looking back and I'll pretend like I'm going along my business without looking worried about you" glance. As you come closer--staying as close as possible to the exact opposite side of the sidewalk so as not to look like you want to engage her--a minority percentage will tersely change their direction. Most just keep pretending like they don't notice me, which is the best thing, but the least amount of people consider slowing down and actually letting me pass them. What the heck, am I really that creepy?  Don't think it only happens between sexes, either. I was walking down Bleeker Street one Saturday night in NYC when, after several blocks, I was coming closer to a man going in my direction. He eventually started walking faster, and then quickly crossed the street. Mind you, I was still about half a block away. We walked parallel until I passed him about five blocks later. Ironically, I was suffering from an inflamed knee joint at the time and was trying Very Hard not to look injured and get assaulted myself; the only reason I was walking fast that night (I had nowhere to go) was that it hurt too much to stay on one leg for too long. If the guy had actually started chasing after me, I wouldn't have been able to run. So in conclusion, if a guy's walking up from behind you ON A BRIGHTLY LIT STREET, IN FULL VIEW OF DOZENS OF OTHER PEOPLE, LET THEM PASS YOU. We just want you to move out of the way; we're late for class dammit! Thank you!
