(The answer: no)  But we learned in class that two people's parents live in or near houses or apartments that were once the sites of murders.  Fun.  Other things that cause property values to fall but are probably not casualty losses:  Loud dogs Ugly plants Ugly dogs Loud plants Unseasonably cold temperatures Lingering manure smell from nearby stables Surly mailman Lousy school system Nuclear war
