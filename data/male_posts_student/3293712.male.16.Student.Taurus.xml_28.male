A few things though: I saw a truck down in the pit today that had two bumper stickers. One said, "I love cats, they taste just like chicken." The other said, "So many cats, so few recipes."  Skipped Chemistry today to go downtown filming with Kaddy/Kali. It was nice to be outside.  I have to go to get a cavaty filled tomorrow. That will be scary. Even scarier, though, is that "cavaty" might be the commonly used word in the English language that I can't spell. Someone wanna get back to me on that, tomorrow?  Until tomorrow, then.
