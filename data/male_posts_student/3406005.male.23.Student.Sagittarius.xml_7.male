There must be some explanation....  Alas, the resourceful and egotisical Mr. Clark has uncovered the real reason (from the Toronto Star):   Clark said there are two candidates for the new Conservative party for whom he would consider campaigning — Jim Prentice in Calgary North Centre and Ted Menzies in Macleod — but that they might not want to anger their leader, Stephen Harper, by inviting him.   Ah, now everything falls into place. No sane person would reject Joe's campaign assistance; Jim Prentice was actually instructed by Harper to spite Joe. I see, I see.  Can anyone say "cognitive dissonance"?   Which leaves one question open: why would "the devil we don't know" be so adamently opposed to his candidates recieving help from Clark, while the "devil we do know" is apparently fine and dandy with it?  Furthermore, Clark's pick-and-choose campaign ("Clark said he was urging Canadians to support the person and not the party.") contains some fairly tough logical flaws. For one thing, who would form a government once Canadians have completed their task of choosing super-fantastic candidates without reference to parties? Who would become the prime minister under such a mish-mash of loose fish?   Ah, my friend, how little you know of the mind of Charles Joseph Clark. Once assembled, the "good" MPs (as opposed to those naughty "bad" MPs, Harper included) would put their heads together and select as prime minister, the smartest, most articulate, most visionary, and most handsome politician ever to ascend The Hill.  Who?  Thats right........  urlLink    You like me, you really like me! urlLink
