GAH Spiderman is such a badass, I'm wearing a Spiderman T-shirt RIGHT NOW.  If you didn't like the first one, then screw you, quit reading my weblog.  As for movies, I'm going to see if Chronicles of Riddick is worth seeing by downloading and watching the prequel, Pitch Black. From what I hear, it kicks ass.  That's it for today.  -Reb
