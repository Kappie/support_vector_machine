Sitting at the first orientation session with my dad, we were both bowled over by the number of students... all there to make the most ridiculous music the world has ever heard.  Not a bad goal.  That first day, among the many awesome people I met, was a jazz singer from LA.  She came from the same performing arts high school as Sara Lieb, who's this badass Berklee alum (a ripe old 21 yrs of age) who's got an album on Berklee's jazz label, and has sung with Kurt Elling (GAH!), Kevin Mahogany (GAH!), et al.  Anyway, she and I will be working together a bunch.  She was all excited that there was an entering male jazz singer.  Well okay then.  And yesterday was the day I was stressing about like mad... auditions.  Had to audition for ensemble ratings.  They rate you on a scale of 1-8 in 4 areas: vocal proficiency, sightreading, improvisation, and rhythmic interpretation, with 1 being entering student and 8 being Charlie Parker.  So after watching several really good singers come out with straight 2's, I was a liiiiittle scared.  Then I went in and fucked up the sightreading part.  So much for the part I  kneeewww  I'd nail.  Then I sang.  God, did I sing.  I was impressed.  Apparently they were, too, because I got a 3-2-4-4 (in the category order stated above), with an overall rating of 4, which landed me with my first choice of teachers, labs, and hopefully a badass ensemble.  AAAAHHHHHH!  So we're off to a good start.  Today, I bring stuff to my sis at Wheaton, drop off a financial aid form at Berklee, and move my stuff out of the Rock Harbor Estate.  *sniff*  I sure will miss that house.  Classes start next Mon, and I'm really excited.  Also have to move into my apartment and get a job soon.  Like tomorrow.  Hehe... this sure is fun.  Berklee is the grestest place on earth.
