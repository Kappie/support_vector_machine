I am also slightly pissed off at the people who forward these to me too. They should have enough brains than to forward those to me.  This much I know is true, nothing bad has ever happened to me yet, not as those stated in the e-mails anyway. Well, if someone is going to get it, I might just as well get all of it and die from it anyway. I've already deleted so many of those. I'd rather just die than pass it on to the other 15 or 20 or even more people that is stated and let them suffer. If them, why not me?  I don't know how this topic came up, just popped up in my head suddenly...
