Poker took longer than expected so that is the reason.  He will try and make it more interesting starting Saturday, or at least Sunday.  The day was a pretty simple breeze.  Nothing that was challenging for almost the entire day.  Which is a total relief cuz Tyke really didn't want to do anything.  Tyke had a sub 1st period which allowed him to just "do" his AP Gov homework but really he just made up some of the randomest crazy-ass bullshit ever.  It was pretty funny.  Just so you know, the President is no longer the top man in his own organization chart :).  Tyke got to play basketball second period.  He couldn't really shoot as it was a tough little surface to play on cuz they were in the upper gym.  And it was tough to drive cuz he just got mutilated with hacks and elbows while driving so he would end up just forcing the shot but since there weren't fouls he just would end up putting up a poor shot.  Tyke was teamed with the best player on the basketball team and at the least Tyke showed him that Tyke was not to be taken lightly.  He can ball with the best of em.  His defense was great.  A few steals go a long way for the team.  Long enough to get the win.  Tyke hit a few outside shots and had some nice lay-ins.  All in all, he proved his worth.  3rd period involved talking randomly and watching the West Wing so as to "learn."  4th period though, what a hell hole this is becoming.  Mrs. Dyke-Bitch is giving hella work and quizzes all of a sudden.  And she probably thinks that this is preparing the class for the AP test.  But it sure as hell ain't.  Taking quizzes on words that the students simply memorize for one quiz and write silly poems in groups and do some homework that has no relevance to general concepts really isn't doing jack for them.  It almost makes them dumber.  Tyke has probably gotten dumber this year.  His blog is the only thing he writes in.  He certainly doesn't do writing things for English.  And Tyke has only had to write 2 or 3 essays all year in Gov with only 1 of them being graded.  That is just stupid if you really want to get prepped.  You need to get a lot of practice to do well.  Like last year.  That preparation paid off (not really in Lit it turned out).  But all in all, this year is a total blow off.  It is quite comical the effort Tyke puts in.  In all of his classes.  He slacks more than the stoners who barely come to class.  Maybe not more, but seemingly on par with them.  After the majority of the day Tyke went out to lunch at Pie but he got screwed.  He ran to try and beat these three kids that were about to walk in and he almost made it.  He sprinted hard but couldn't quite get around them.  So they ended up taking all of the good pieces and Tyke would have had to wait a hella long time for a piece so he just got the runt of the litter.  It was pretty poor.  Mediocre really.  But it still did a good enough job.  Actually, Tyke is hungry now.  Mmmm...Snickers bar.  That would be nice now.  Ooooo...or a huge slice of pumpkin pie with whipped cream.  No no.  Just the whipped cream.  A full can of whipped cream.  That tastes so good if you haven't ever just flipped it upside down and just started spraying it directly into your mouth.  Cut out the middle man and you get what you really want.  It is damn good.  Ok, 6th period.  It was fun.  The last day of the student teacher teaching which is kinda too bad cuz she became fun.  They hardly ever had a bad period when she was teaching.  Tyke read from the Physics book aloud again.  His accents are just random.  Random, random, random.  Pretty much you could sum up Tyke Translucent Turner in one word.  Random.  After school Tyke joined up with Macaroon and Fejj at Amed's house and they played some bball.  It was fun and Tyke owned the first game of 21.  Then he stopped playing and Amed won.  But Tyke jammed his fingers during the first game of Tyke-Macaroon versus Amed-Fejj.  Tyke and Macaroon schooled.  Tyke just kept hitting 2 bombs from everywhere with anyone on him.  It was sick.  And Macaroon would chip in a point or two occasionally too.  They won the first 3 games and then started missing the 2s so they had to kinda fight back but lost.  And apparently, that game was the championship or the important game or something.  Yeahhhh, suuuuure.  After Tyke's pizza dinner and such Macaroon, Tyronious, Amed, and Kinker all came over.  They played ESPN, MOH, and poker.  Tyke got 2nd!!!!  He outlasted everyone but Kinker who won the entire pot.  But Tyke still played longer than anyone else but Kinker.  Oh yeah, Tyke bought in 5 times.  So he lost 10 bucks.  Oh well, he was up 33 from before.  So that is fine.  He will win it back next time.  He was playing stupid anyway.  Amed is a funny player though.  He just makes it so much different.  He adds a whole new element.  So does Macaroon.  But we won't talk about that :(.  So then it became late and Tyke blogged.  And the cow jumped over the moon.  Night.  (Go Dotti!)
