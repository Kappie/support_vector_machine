Met DYT while doing paper route, so I helped with hers too... then I won't mention how I left 10 mins early (me and hoshi decided to leave house at 2.. next time, decided when to  meet , not when to leave.. =\ ), then waited for 1/2 hour and watched 4 buses go by... lol.. i won't mention that at all ^^ anyhow, after walking/talking awhile, we saw Joe.. turns out he finished summer school. We talked with him a bit, then it was dismissal.. and then there was Keane. We talked for awhile too, before I went.. hope you guys had fun!   Anyhow, after spending some time watching Transformers Armada, Yugioh and Beyblade (yes i'm bored), I ate dinner then went out to play basketball. For like the first half hour, my mom wanted to play to *chokes with laughter* she actually got quite a few in at short distance =P anyhow, then like usual, I spend most of my time just shooting the ball by myself for like an hour, then this girl appeared out of nowhere and asked if she could play, so I said yes.   we spent like the first 10 mins shooting in silence.. i'm always awkward around strangers =\ but anyhow, after talking for a few mins, justin and ashley came along, and i introduced them and stuff. Turns out that that girl immigrated not too long ago.. only spoke mandarin, so she couldn't understand canto. Surprisingly, she was 16 too (i had thought 17 or 18), and goes to a school in downtown. and she's fasttracking high school oO;; taking it in 3 years rather than 4... scary... =P   no hoshi, i don't think she was trying to hit on me... and no, i wasn't "interested" in her =P   we played bball till 10, then i had to go home.. then after a short convo on the phone, then freaking out for awhile about the HP1 i lent *coughcough* (it was late!!) i went to bed. For some odd reason, I woke up at 5 am... I decided to stay awake. I mean... might as well, no? I think I woke up because a dream finished...    ~Chronos
