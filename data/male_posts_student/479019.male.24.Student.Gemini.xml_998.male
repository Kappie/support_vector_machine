For example, the other day at work there was a pretty good looking girl... ok maybe woman might be a better word, that came in. In terms of clothing, disposition, and voice, she struck me as someone that has self-esteem issues. On a warm summer day, she was covered in light clothing and large brimmed hat. The vibe I got from her personality, I'd also guess that she's one of those people who collect things. I don't know what, but she just seemed like someone who collects stupid shit. She was alone, and I get the feeling she was in Laguna Beach on vacation. Either from a far flung part of SoCal or from a bus tour. The vibe I get from her is that she is someone who feels a lack of control in life.  Another girl, who I described to Katrina as "all sorts of fucked up" recently probably has some interesting / bad stuff in her past. I think it's not a simply a pretentious stuck of OC thing for her. There's just something about her behavior that suggests some deep problems.   I just watched  Walking Tall  and  Hellboy . Both decent movies.  I'm also playing a ROM Link's Awakening on my cell phone right now. Fun stuff. It's supposed to be the real sequel to Link to the Past for SNES.  ***
