And Second thought was emerging .. Suddenly my own blogspot crossed my shaky mind. And I acted upon things I wanted to do.   To leave my footsteps here I choosed and they will all one day remaind me of days gone. Recent days, I really feel like the other person who is quite different from who I was months ago. Maybe nothing really has changed dramatically so far and just I become restless. this is the only why I'm so depressed. But I can't tell which or what is right or how to straighten out problems appearing day by day.   Today anyhow is the day I built my own world here in the internet.  Revolutionized world I live in and renders me split into several personal characters, which I did not mean in the first place.
