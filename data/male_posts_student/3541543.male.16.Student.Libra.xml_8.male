I'm sorry but your not going alone, you said your brother was going also. I say if you don't want to go alone sell your ticket on Ebay. And then sometime later we all can go man, I don't want to pass up this time with Ash and not because I WORSHIP her. I am not obsessed, considering this camp thing wasn't recent at all. I thought I mentioned that I couldn't go sometime before all of this. But I really like her even though lots of things happened that don't make sense to me. Right now my feelings the only thing that seem right to me, and maybe I am being blinded by her awesome charisma. lol but there isn't much anything anyone can do to change that except Ash, and I'm going to see this all the way through even if I crash and burn. To me it's still worth the shot and we are friends man, don't start thinking that we going to get back together real soon. I know what happened and I'm going to do whatever it takes to prevent that. Idk if you saw Ash how I did than you would understand my insanity lol. Just let me live how I'm going to, and I know this makes me sound like an A**hole but really you can't change how I feel. Let me learn on my own, lol here is a proverb I'm going by "fall off horse seven times, get up eight times". Good things happen to those who wait and thats exactly what I'm doing. Don't think it's just Ash and me again. We aren't together and she can do what she pleases, just like I can do whatever I want. And if I want to wait for her I will, and she wants to go out and have fun while I'm gone so be it. It isn't me to decide what people can and cannot do.   I'm afraid that your perspective on this whole thing is unfinished because you are judging on what you see and know. And you don't know that much, nothing has changed between Ash and I. We aren't "together" and I am not obsessed and worship her even though I know how she wants me to ;) lol jk. Seriously I thought you knew about me not being able to go because you mentioned that to everyone "well this sucks, it looks like i have to go all by myself". Guess you were just kidding but I didn't realize that. Also don't think I being "saved" by going to a christian camp, I still stand by what I believe in. I don't need christian beliefs to make me a better person than I am. I already know what I stand for and the Bible teaches many good things, but I don't have to believe in God to be how I am. I'm already a good person and I try and be a better understanding, forgiving person. What can christianity do for me except subside my fear of death. And I'm not bashing religion idk I just find it far-fetched and full of unanswered questions. Aut yeah thats another post lol I'll save that for another day. Alright well I'm out see ya later.
