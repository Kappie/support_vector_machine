From this point forward, I will make a post each week that highlights the coolness of one of my friends or family members...and when I run out of them, I will start highlighting acquaintances and public or not so public figures. At the same time, I will compare myself to these people, and in doing so, will tear myself down. In honor of Brock's courage for pointing out the error of my ways (knowing full-well I could beat the crap out of him next time I am in Chicago), he will be the first subject and subsequent posts about friends will be called the  Weekly Brock . So lets get to it.    Brock L.: The man, the myth, the legend.     First let me tell you a bit about Brock's physical characteristics. The man is 6'4", 220lbs, and built like a brick sh*thouse. Despite his size, he has the grace of a butterfly in a cool spring breeze. He is quite dashing with his blond hair and blue eyes--he looks like your typical All-American Johnny Football Hero--and that brings us to our next discussion.    Brock is a legendary football player (and that's le football American for you soccer fans). Brock's strong right arm and comfort with having hishand on the center's ass led the Carterville Lions to aIllinois StateFootball Title in 1996. Let us take a look at Brock'sstats, and by comparing them to mine, get a sense for why I am always humbled in his presence. Shall we:   Passing Att. Comp. Int. Yds. TD  Brock L.  150 717 1,357 20   Anything  Ted C. 0000,000 0   It is clear who the better man is.    But football is not all there is to this man...oh no, no, no...Brock is also wise. Let us explore, again comparatively, some statistics.   1) Number of timesone of us kissed a girl,and then welater realized it was a really, reallybad idea:   Ted: 9  Brock: 0   2) Number of years served as a University Mascot:   Ted: 3  Brock: 0   3) Number of dollars earned to date:   Ted:-$100,000  Brock: $657,432.34   4) Number of times singing Spanish karaoke (without speaking Spanish):   Ted: 1  Brock: 0    It is clear from these stats that Brock uses his immense wisdom to make rational, logical choices; whereas, I do not always do so. I would like to note that, if elected, I would hire Brock as a senior advisor to help me make logical, rational decisions. The funny thing about all this is if I do run for office in 2020-something, an aged, decrepit Bill O'Reilly will be reading my Blogs from 2004 and be using words like 'travesty', 'abomination', and (my personal favorite) 'idiot'.  Now for some links:   1) This is a newspaper article from Brock's University, which features the quote, 'Sophomore quarterback Brock L. has been the only quarterback in camp, and [Coach] Quarlessdid not look forward to having that situation.'  urlLink http://www.dailyegyptian.com/Spring98/041598/spt-drills.html   2) More on Brock's high school career:  urlLink http://www.ihsa.org/activity/fb/1996-97/3info3.htm   3)More on Bill O'Reilly:  urlLink http://www.billoreilly.com/
