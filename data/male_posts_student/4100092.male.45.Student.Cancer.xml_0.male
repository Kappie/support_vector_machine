People often imagine the awakening of the soul as some gentle magical experience, when in fact it may be engulfed in conflict.  When the inner person is revealed it is often confusing to those who have known us, it is also confusing to us as well.  We may not have been real behind the facade however we at least were predictable.    	This conflict is the subject of the movie, The Matrix.  It is the realization that no matter how harsh reality may be, life behind the facade needs to be rejected.  We all must come to the truth.  In the movie "Neo's" has a conflicting conversation with a nemesis "Cypher".  Cypher was a member of Morpheus' crew, Cypher decides the life of a resistance fighter isn't all it's cracked up to be and engineers a deal to be reinserted back into the Matrix, at the expense of Zion.  He comments to "Neo", "I know what you are thinking, why oh why didn't you take the blue pill?"    	As shocking as this scene is I have asked myself that question a million times.  Having our eyes opened is no picnic, the pursuit of what is genuine is at times conflicted.  It was easier when I didn't know, I didn't see.    	My struggle continues, as I embrace the reality that for me there is no going back.  And so I end this post asking a question of you, "why didn't you take the blue pill?"  As we walk this out,   The Hitchhiker
