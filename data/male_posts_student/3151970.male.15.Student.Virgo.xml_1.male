Like I said, they just upgraded to 0.9 and it has a lot of new features.     - Extension Manager - Theme Manager - Data Migration/Import - New Visual Theme - Better Bookmarks - Better Search - Smaller Download - Online Help - And a Bunch of Bug Fixes  Its nick name is "the build your own" browser.  You can change literally ANYTHING about the browser through things called Extensions!  There are over 200  urlLink here .    If you're still using IE and havn't used Tabbed browsing yet, it will change your life.  Well, maybe not, but it could possibly make you a bit more organized than having 400 IE windows open on your taskbar.  It has a great popup blocker!    My favorite Extension is  urlLink Adblock .  It will actually block most ads from your web pages! How great is that?  No more anoying animations on pages wanting you to buy their product when you're trying to read something you actually care abou :)  DOWNLOAD THIS NOW   urlLink Firefox
