I was confident, made the right calls at the right time, and projected a professional attitude that announced to the players - "No bullshit this season, boys."  I have a partner this time, too.  It's a lot easier to feel confident when the other Ref has less experience than you.  I felt more in charge, more of a mentor - more responsiblity to the job.  It's also less nerve-wracking when you have the ability to share the blame for something missed.  I was quickly reminded how tricky it can be to maintain your balance at highspeeds.  (that's something Todd don't have to worry about!) These guys are fast, too.  Most of 'em anyway.  Don still plays - (Vern's cousin Don) so does Shwanger.  Buck-who was on the first Central-winning purple-jerseyed team with me - also still plays.
