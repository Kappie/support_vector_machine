Needless to say that Jonah and I will be having an abrupt conversation sometime very soon.  Also Happy Birthday  urlLink Deborah !  Also, JournalCon 2: Electric Boogaloo falls close enough to my birthday to warrant a party. Bring Presents. I will place a blessing upon the offspring of whoever can bring me  urlLink this . Or a reciept saying that it is shipping June 1st.  Shut up, Carrie. You don't want a baby. You want shoes.
