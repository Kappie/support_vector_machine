I guess it means you better brace yourself for some ads)  Well, I just got back from Boston last nite at the airport, what a trip!! At first I was kind of questioning whether I would end up liking it or not, but it turned out about.... oh... i think it's safe to say a BILLION times better than i expected!  Lemme make a shoutout to the COA people- You guys are the greatest- I don't think i could come up with anyone else i know that would have made that anywhere close to as fun as it was.  ...Except for that church service on Sunday...  blah  So i've missed a week of stuff in Irving, so what? I got all caught up and stuff last night.  Did we all agree that Blue Man Group was the highlight of the whole trip? I think we did, but i'm not sure...  I'm also not sure, but i think somewhere along the way I was unofficially voted funniest person in Boston. But again, I'm not sure. X-P  Pudding.  Okay, this weekend, I'm off to Houston for 2 days to work to help my mom with this dog training thing she's doing. I get a hundred dollahs. :-O!  I keep thinking about that guy sitting opposite me on our row on the plane. He was an | ASSHOLE | !   Now that I'm home in Irving, All i have left to think to myself is "How the hell did i ever have fun here?" Besides... the people, the mall, and the TGC, Irving is kind of a bland place to live. Oh sure, the city is trying to make itself more pedestrian-prone, what with walk-through parks for a 1/7 mile stretch on Story Road, but i think all 3 people who have ever walked through them said that it wasn't as much of an exciting and magical journey as the architects had imagined.  Well, at least we can't be killed by falling poodles, right? RIGHT!??!?!?!  I guess it's back to making my cartoons.  I'll post back later.
