At the moment they point to imaginery pages, but they'll come next :)  2) Created an index copy called subindex.php with the querystring 'platform=' Now the console menu's work - subindex filters through all the query's and just picks the ones with the relevant console.   i.e. http://server1.larrytech.biz/~thunder6/subindex.php?platform=PS2
