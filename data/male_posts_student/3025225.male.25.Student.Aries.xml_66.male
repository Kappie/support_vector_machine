It is often a kind of innocent pride, and the man of genius and the aristocrat are frequently regarded as eccentrics because genius and aristocrat are entirely unafraid of and uninfluenced by the opinions and vagaries of the crowd. Edith Sitwell (1887 - 1964)    His ignorance is encyclopedic - Abba Eban (1915-2002)
