On the first part, the driving laws section, out of twenty questions I answered eighteen questions right and on the road signs section, out of twenty question I answered nineteen questions right. So I got a 90 and a 95 which the lady at the desk that Mom is friends with because she works upstairs and knows everyone said that that was great so I was happy. Then I had to stand in the line and get my picture and stuff entered into the computer. The picture is aight I guess. Are license pictures ever good though? Mom let me drive down the street to Dottie's house to meet up with Robin and the girls since they are back in town. It was odd I must say. She said I'll get to drive more once I'm use to the size of the vehicle. Good day. Got my learner's, got more Starbucks, went to Old Navy, CompUsa, the Atlanta Bread Company, Petsmart, and Publix to go shopping for some food. Then, spent quite a long time at Dottie's place on the boat and swimming. Good times not much to talk about so later peeps!
