Well, I came out with a marvellous story plot for my Chinese compo, and I was so happy! HaHaHa!   YaY! I beta'ed two pages of Kelly's story. HaHa! I noticed a couple of interesting things about her. I shall not reveal it here, of course, to protect her privacy. Meow moo!  Okay. Today's choir was sucky in general. In general. Right. Let me start from the beginning.   Right. I thought it was a private practise, but only to discover that we had Hall rehearsals. Darn.   Okay. Basically it went horribly. First there was the mike problems. Secondly, we can't co-ordinate with our lives! Our dance steps sucks. Sigh. I was moved constantly. I ended up standing in between Gen Sheng and Jun Sheng. Why must I be made to stand near JS everytime? Issit my bad luck?!  Okay. Today, that teacher-in-charge, Miss Kumar, got pissed at the choir. I don't know why, her mood suddenly became foul and started being bitchy. She got so pissed off with us that she placed the Dance Club to sing with us, and ordered us to tuck our t-shirts ALL IN.   Fuck. What is this? She added the Dance club because, apparently it seemed to her, we have no life on stage. Oh! So she thinks the dancers are more lively la! She thinks that they can do better than us la! She thinks that they are so multi-talented enough to dance AND sing. Why not scrape off the choir from the performance list and let the multi-talented dancers do everything? Sheez! Some people have no brains. At all. Then the tucking all in part. Not even folding out a little. What kind of stupid rule is that? Even Mr Kuek doesn't mind leh. Tucking everything in looks so boring (and honestly, geeky). Whoever with a sane mind does that? Sigh...I am so appalled at the horrible teachers leh. One foul mood and they decided to be super bitchy and made life hell for us students. Such teachers should jump off the building. I mean, the students are so innocent loh. When I am a teacher, I wouldn't do that to my students. Even I have more morals and integrity! Take that, Miss Usha Kumar!!!  Right. Following that ugly episode, all of us were like so wanting to boycott her. John pointed out that although it would be nice to do that (and show her who's boss! She can't just come in here and bitch her way around us!), but it would be a waste of our efforts if we just boycott because of a stupid event. Why don't we prove her wrong. I mean, we are good. We know that. We wanted to show her that she was so damn wrong in picking on us. We devised a set of our moves, and we are so not informing the Dancers. Let them dance their own moves, or fumble while trying to mimic us. The dancing was so damn fun! We are sooo evil. I was enjoying myself singing while moving to funny actions. :D Great job, choir! Keep it up! We can do it!!  Coming back, it was already 9. Luckily I don't have homework wor, or else I wouldn't even be online now, ranting about the ugly side of life. Yes!   Okie. I gotta go. See ya next time (Don't think I am blogging tomorrow. Coming back late due to choir, and I expect that there'll be Chem Prac homework). TaTa! Night blog!
