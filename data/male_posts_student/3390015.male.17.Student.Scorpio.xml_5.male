I've been planning this for awhile now...I'm going to lock myself in my room...if that's possible...and finish writing my screenplay...I've got all the ideas in my head and on paper, now I just need to type.  I'll only come out to eat, exercise, and go to the movies to watch The Day After Tomorrow...  I'm giving myself until this Monday to complete the bulk of the script, if I don't finish sooner...hopefully I'll finish sooner, much sooner.  Anyway, pray for me that I can get this done, because I want to send it out to a good Christian friend of ours in Hollywood, because I think it's a great script concept I have here, very clever...the plot of The Italian Job, The Score, and Mission: Impossible all wrapped into one, it basically takes the idea of Mission: Impossible one step further in terms of the plot, and has elements of The Score's cleverness, with a mix of The Italian Job's clever heists....
