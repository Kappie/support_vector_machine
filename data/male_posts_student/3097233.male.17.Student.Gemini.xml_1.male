I haven't posted too much lately, and I am sorry for that, not that there is a mass amount reading here so yea, hehe. I will try to catch back up on this!  O, before I forget about this again, I make art, yea, you heard that right. I make art, well GIFs and alter images like the 4 down there at the bottom of this post. So if anybody wants anything done I can try and do it for them cause yea, it is fun, and I'm practicing at the skills for it all.  Women are evil, evil, creatures... They know they have what us males need and flaunt it. Evil little girls, hehe. Not sure about them though, not that trustworthy... Cannot trust them! Well maybe, I don't know.  Wow, my printer just flipped off! How very special. Speaking of Printers, anybody know how to get an  ALARIS WeeCam  webcamera working? Mine is dead and all and it hates me and won't work right!  That is a good post for right now, I'll think of some more like my Decades project or something to talk about later on.
