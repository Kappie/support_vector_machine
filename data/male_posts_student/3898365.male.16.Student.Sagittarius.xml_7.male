Hey Natalie, I think you left your phone at Robin's last night, but I have it now and I'll bring it with me to class. If it isn't hers, then I'm selling it. Hey, don't you judge me. Sometimes a man just needs his crack but doesn't have the money to get it.  Oh man, my mom told me the greatest thing yesterday. I no longer look upon my childhood as being boring and stupid. When I was first learning to talk, my Aunt Nancy would spend her time whenever she was around teaching me songs. So you want to know what the first songs I ever learned to sing were? "Lola" by the Kinks and "Take a Walk on the Wild Side" by Lou Fucking Reed.  One of the first songs I learned was written and performed by a former Velvet Underground member. That means some of the first words out of my mouth were “But she never lost her head/Even when she was giving head.” That is so fucking awesome! I love my Aunt Nancy even more now. I always wondered what it would have been like if I was born to her instead of my mom, and now I know. It would have fucking rocked.  You know what happened last night? I organized something. I organized a meeting of our friends at a movie theater to see  Anchorman . Okay, that's an accomplishment. Normally when I try to plan things, they don't work out. But last night, Amy, Kit, Robin, Elise, Devin, Natalie and I were all there laughing our asses off at pretty much the funniest movie ever. I'm sorry, but  Wet Hot American Summer  had a good run. I'll always love you even though you are only in second place.  But  Anchorman  had everything and everyone I love. I was squealing at each of the fantastic cameos. Paul, Jay, Jerry, Jack, Fred, Vince, Seth, I loved them all. The only cameo I didn't like was Ben Stiller. Wow, maybe I do just... really not like him. But in our theater, there was a smattering of applause when Ben showed up on screen, which made me want to vomit. He doesn't deserve clapping. The "Mr. Show," and "Saturday Night Live," and "Freaks and Geeks," alumni that had cameos in the movie deserved applause more than Ben did.  Will Ferrell is seriously a god. Everything that is funny seeps from him like jam from a half-eaten donut. One of the jam-filled donuts. You know... with jam inside...  I hope this launches Steve Carell's movie career so he doesn't have to keep doing movies like Sleepover and Bruce Almighty (although he was effing hee-larious in that).   I don’t get why nobody laughed at Fred Willard's conversations with his son. I thought those were pretty funny.  We listened to a little bit of Hedwig in the car on the way to the movie (my mom drove Amy, Robin, Elise, and I) and they really liked it. So after the movie we dropped by my house, grabbed Hedwig and watched it at Robin's. It was another fun night in Robin's basement.  Okay, well, enough for now, I gots to go get ready.  EDIT:  Drawing class, rocked. I seriously loved it. The teacher guy puts no pressure on anybody to do good, just to do. Just to get something on the paper to vent and express yourself and not care what other people think of it, to just make it because it means something to you.  I know I'm gonna love the rest of the classes. I feel so much better just from all the venting I did in that two-hour time period. Just pressing as hard as I could on the paper, getting my hands completely filthy with graphite but not caring. My fingers were sore, but I felt so great.  Okay, in the last three days, there have been some things said to me that I will remember forever and ever and ever. Here they are:  1. On Friday for Ecology class, we spent all day walking around this restoration site at Johnson Creek with a guy from OSU. At lunch time, Jenny and I were sitting on a play structure eating our lunches and playing that game where you have a bunch of dots and you have to make squares by taking turns making single lines. I forget what it's called. So the guy, Sam Chen, comes up the play structure to talk to us. He said that we were both incredibly knowlegable about the field for kids our age and could easily have successful futures in the field or a related one.   2. Thursday night after a few hours at Amy's, I hitched a ride to my house in the Shields van. Susie asked me about my situation with driving and I told her that I've had my permit for a year, but have only actually driven three times. I told her about my driving at our family property last weekend, and she said something along the lines of "I don't know why, but I would trust you to drive my car right now."  3. When I was heading into the back room to wash my completely black hands off from the graphite pencil and the teacher stopped me to chat. He asked how old I was and if I had any past art experience. I told him I was going into my Junior year and that I've only taken basic art classes my Freshman year and in middle school. He told me that I did a great job for the first class.  "At least she died doing what she loved most. Comitting suicide."
