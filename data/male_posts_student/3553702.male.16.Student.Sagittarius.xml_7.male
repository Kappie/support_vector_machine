And the reason is quite simple. Summer. Oh, how I love thee...and yet...you stab me in the back. Summer is both a great and crappy mistress because during summer, I get to lounge about and chill, something that I don't get to do as much in the school year. However...vacations and such that take me out of town are quite the annoyance. I'll begin with the reason I haven't posted in a week.  My family recently embarked on an odd and wondrous journey known as a 'cruise'. For those not in 'the know', a cruise is a journey taken on, big surprise, a cruise ship. A cruise ship is, basically, a  BIG FREAKING BOAT . Although I knew it would be big, I was not prepared for the pure size of it. For a good idea, just imagine a hotel, with a casino, several real-life sized restaurants, and a half-dozen real-life sized clubs and lounges. All rolled together, add a pool, and you've got the cruise ship. We drove for a total of 10 hours  (Go ahead and read that again. Yes, 10 hours. Let that sink in for a moment.)  to get to the city of Galveston, where the boat left, and we departed. The cruise went to three places: Progresso, Cozumel, and Belize City. There was plenty to do on the boat, but I think the best thing were the stops. In Cozumel, we hit the beach, which was great, especially the snorkeling. Tons of cool little fish and such. And in Belize (Turns out that's NOT in Mexico. Who knew?) we took a city tour and also visited their zoo, which was a fun experience.  Well, that's what kept me away from blogging and such for the last week and a half. Now, I'll go ahead and explain what will be keeping me from blogging for the NEXT week and a half.  I'm volunteering to be a counselor with a church group for boys ages 8-13 and that will keep me busy for about 4 days. Then, less than 12 hours after I return, I leave to be a camper at my own church camp! Fun. Then, (The fun doesn't stop there!) I go FROM the camp, to my family reunion! Should be GREAT. Although, that means I'll be gone for home, Internet, and Beautiful for another week and a half. Cruel summer.  And now, movie reviews. I've got two movies that I've recently seen and feel the need to post my thoughts on. Dodgeball, and Spiderman II.  Dodgeball: AWESOME!!! I recommend this movie to ANYONE who liked Ben Stiller, because he is the funniest part of the whole movie and it should NOT be missed by a fan. Also, you'll never understand just how cool Chuck Norris is until you see that movie.  Spiderman II: I must say, Spidey II is BETTER than the first one, and I considered the first one to be a masterpiece. So you can imagine how I feel about this one. Doc Ock is played terrifically, the special effects are INSANE, and in most cases you cannot tell when its Toby *Peter Parker/Spiderman* and when its not. If you're on the fence as you watch the movie, I guarantee you will agree with me on both the greatness of this movie AND the awesomeness of the special effects when you see what I lovingly call "The Train Scene". PURE BEAUTY!!! I honestly consider this to be THE best comic book movie to ever be released.
