First I went out to eat with my mom, and we went to La Bomba, some new mexican restaurant that was kind of not good.  Their cheese dip was a lot better than Laredo's though, so I guess I'll have to give it a... 4.5 out of 10.  Then after that I went home and sat around for about an hour.  Theeeeeeen I went to Tom Hess' house with a group of people and we played capture the flag for a while.  This is when the interesting stuff started to happen.  We got out some bottle rockets, and we were throwing them at each other, and I freaked out cuz one was like, right next to me.  I started running, and I completely fell into Tom's pond, and got totally soaked all over.  I smelled like shit, my clothes were soaked, and I was laughing my ass off, hahah it was great.  But then I remembered my cellphone was in my pocket.... and so yeah, thats not good for the phone.  Hopefully when it completely dries out it will work again.  Yeah then a little later that night, Ben was melting some electrical tape, and for some reason decided to throw it on my foot, which was a great idea!  It stuck to my foot, and it was hot as hell and burnt like crazy!  When I finally reached down there and ripped it off, it got stuck to my hand, and it hurt like crazy bad there too.  Result: I got a huge blister on the top of my foot, and it burnt until I woke up this morning, hehe.  It doesn't hurt anymore though, which is a good thing, and I popped the blister, so it just keeps oozing instead of getting really big, which is kinda a good thing.  So yep, thats pretty much all that happened.
