This hotel actually has Wi-Fi high speed internet access, so I can now post some of the stuff I have been writing over this long trip.   We are almost to the place that we are going to be staying for a couple of days, but for now we are only staying in one place for the night. Once I get to The Penn Stater (the hotel we made reservations at), I will be able to post some more entries and visit other people's blogs.   I have some pictures I want to post, but I'm not sure about how I'm going to do that. I downloaded Picasa, but I realized too late that Hello Bloggerbot requires Instant Messaging, which I don't have. I'm looking into getting Flickr, but we'll just have to wait and see how that turns out. Until then, just be happy that you have more posts to read.   Weâ€™ve driven 476miles since this morning, which means we only have about 200 miles to go tomorrow. We have been in five states today: Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and now Pennsylvania. While we were inWest Virginia stopping for gas,we witnessed a traffic accident. A minivan collided with a small car, and the accident looked bad, since there was a lot of smoke coming from the minivan (I couldn't see the car). Besides that, today's drive has been uneventful.   Well, I must get going if I am going to figure out how to post pictures.   Be blessed! Neo
