I got up at...don't remember, except that it was later than I planned. Soon realized that since DMV closed at noon, any hope of getting my permit that day was lost. Would have to wait a month. Soon thereafter, I realized how much preperation I had to do for Costa Rica - and how imminent Humza's party was. Heavy hearted, called Humza to tell him I couldn't make it. But he seemed okay, and I'm sure whatever his mom cocked more than cheered up the party.  At this point, Costa Rica takes over my life.
