I'm not going to spoil it. 2 big thumbs upfrom me and your mom!   I feel stoned now, and did right after I watched it. Not that I'm exactly speaking from anykind of personal experiance here, but I really do feel very strange. I'm tired, calm, and strangely, sort of happy. I mean, come on. I tried to spell "indisputably" as such "indusputabally" ... yeah.
