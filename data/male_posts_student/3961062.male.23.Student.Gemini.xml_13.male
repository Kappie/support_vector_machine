"A few years later, the U.S. began using professional athletes at the Games - Dream Teams. I always found that term ironic because now that we have Dream Teams, we seldom ever get to dream," he said.  But judging from the U.S. men's basketball team's thrashing at the hands of Puerto Rico (!) today, we may have to start dreaming.  How is it that the supposed best players in the world get  urlLink trounced by 19 points  by a bunch of "no-names"?  Well, I suppose there could be several explanations.  Most of the guys on the team are fairly young, albeit very talented.  Lebron James has one pro season under his belt, and Okafur just graduated from UCONN last spring, but youth shouldn't be enough to cause a loss of this magnitude.  Coach Larry Brown's post-game comments could be closer to the real reason for the loss:  "I had a job to do as a coach, to get us to understand how we're supposed to play as a team and act as a team, and I don't think we did that."  An individualistic attitude seems to have become more pervasive in recent years, especially among NBA players.  The game has become more of a one-on-one showcase of spoiled stars, and apparently the current Dream squad has had multiple defections and issues with players showing up to team meetings.  It's time for these men to learn some more wisdom from Kurt: "When you pull on that jersey, the name on the front is a hell of alot more important than the one on the back."
