I stuck my head out the window and she responded that she thought I was "John's handsome father."  Keep in mind that this woman is at least fifty and my dad is -- well he's my dad!  I got an Egg McMuffin there and it was pretty good.  However, the man who served me called me "sir" way too much.  It was kind of freaky.  On the way home, the incredibly stupid Nancy Hall on Q105 mentioned this web site below:  urlLink Pardon Martha Stewart Petition   I signed it and you should too!  However, she said President Bush would be too busy to look at it because of everything else he's doing.  But stupid Nancy doesn't realize that the President only signs a pardon; people who work for him do the work.  I have to go get ready for work.  I'm working 9 to 5 and then 6 to 8.  Before work, though, I have to return stuff to the hardware store in Mystic.  Maybe tonite I'll watch Gladiator chez Corey.
