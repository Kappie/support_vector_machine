If you live in the outer suburbs, going to the big fireworks display on the Mall entails traffic jams, sardine-packed metro rides, lots of involuntary flesh pressing once you get there, and sweat.  Lots of sweat.  But I was able to avoid all of that.    How, you ask?  By finding the grassy knoll.  Tucked somewhere in the Pentagon's vast campus lies a parking lot that backs up to a steep, short hill with a wide, flat top that provides a great view of the Washington Monument, Jefferson Memorial and Capitol.  And it's high enough to provide a view that's relatively unobstructed by trees and highways and other potential barriers.  So pretty much a perfect viewing spot.    The show itself was worth the wait, wet grass and bug bites.  I'm no pyrotechnician, but it was really well done and entertaining.  Beyond the mesmerizing colors, showers and booms, the crowd was striking as well; I hadn't ever thought about how resonant fireworks are to Americans.  There were probably one hundred or so people on the knoll, and nobody acted a fool, said anything obnoxious, intruded on anyone else's good time or did anything to draw people's enjoyment away from the spectacle across the water.  Once the shooting started, folks pretty much just shut up and stared, making no noise save the occasional ooh or ahh (except for the loud applause when a National Airport -bound jet flew seemingly straight through the spreading gold flames).     The point of sharing this is not to make some contrived point about unity or patriotism or nationalism or jingoism, but rather to just share what I saw.  Please share comments on what you observed or experienced this weekend.
