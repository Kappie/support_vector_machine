Suffice it to say that they involve camping. She wonders where I will camp, how I shall prepare for it, and more. I don't like her knowing though, mostly because of a recent strain of teenage independance I've caught. I told her I planned to camp for 2 weeks and she balked. Too dangerous, too long, too little preparation. Honesty again, I'm okay with this danger. It will be different than other dangers. Skydiving and bungee jumping are false recklessness as there is always an emergency parachute or a safety line. In my plans, there is no tether leading me back home to security. I want it that way. Too long is too bad. I need it to be long. Too little preparation I agree with. I plan to find a nearby DNR office and get registration for camping. I'll ask them where's a good place nearby to do some dispersed camping (camping outside of campgrounds).  Went to Hages and bought some CDs I've been meaning to buy. Five Iron Frenzy and GS Megaphone. Good bands. Too bad I lost my MP3 player at camp. Oh, yeah, forgot to mention that one. Well, I took it to lab one day and left it in the room. I went back and it wasn't there. Albert saw me listening to it but didn't see were I put it. It may indeed be stolen for all I know. This really sucks. That was my best pasttime and perhaps the most expensive thing I own. I'll have to call Lost  Found at U of M again to make sure it is gone for good.
