I would so much like for something or someone to pick me up, shake me 'til my bones start to hurt, make me come to my damn senses! --_-- I think a lot of stuff piled up in my mind, therefore these feelings... Bah, it'll all sort out soon, I just need some time with my own luck and happiness... (yeah, you know what I mean, don't you honey :))
