Why is it that they are the slowest days of the week? With that I begin my post for today. Today was your typical Wednesday. Sloooow moving. Don't you just hate days like that? So I go to school and I leave home without my Blogger Hoodie. Why you ask? I don't know. So I'm standing at the bus stop freezing my ass off, and well it sucked. So Kenny (my bus driver) shows up late as usual, and I warm up. Then I get to school and head straight to the locker. I pull out my trusty leather airman jacket. Man do I love that jacket. It is soo warm. Then Stefani, Jenkins, and I head off to the Cafeteria, and as we are walking past the old gym I notice I got mud on my Dickies. "Craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap!" I hate it when I get mud on my CLEAN Dickies. So we get into the Cafeteria and do that thang. Stefani gets me some paper towels because our lazy janitors don't fill up the guyâ€™s paper towel thing. Why? I dunno. So anywayz. I wash them off best I could, and then the bell rang so off I go to Early Bird. Ms. Nelson was there. Her son was shot in the neck. So she wasn't having the best time. We just went over the study guides. Fun stuff!  After that I went to French and watched Joan of Arc. The movie is cheesy, but hey, it is a movie right? Then I go to aviation and watch this boring ass movie about weather. The whole class was falling asleep so Mr. Kelly told us to all stand up. "Reach for the air. Bend over, grab your ankles."   Riight. I did get to see Oscar's happy trail and belly button, twice actually. So I guess that is good. He smiled at me too, so I dunno. But yea. Then I went to American Lit and took that test. Easy as pie. Then lunch, and history. Following that was Algebra II. Boring as normal, but hey! It is math; it is supposed to be boring, right?  Well, that is my day. Maybe tonight will be better. Chinese food. Mmmmmm. *drools*. And then tomorrow is TURKEY DAY! Fun fun fun! I love Thanksgiving. If I don't get a chance to post tomorrow, I'm wishing you a happy thanksgiving, and hope everyone is safe.
