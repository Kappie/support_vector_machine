    
       (It's late now... for me at least... so fuck spelling and grammar)  Due to the insane weather patterns of the past 365+ days, I'm unable to put an approximate date to this story. It happened within months of The EXTREME BOWLING NIGHTâ„¢ Fiasco, but I'm not too sure whether it was before or after...  The story starts out as all of my embarrassing stories start out; with Johnny and Kris and I getting together to enjoy the unseasonably nice weather. We wanted to take a walk, as usual, but where? That's when Johnny suggested a "secluded" hang out he frequented that he called "The Cove." Kris and I had heard of it before, and showed no interest, but that particular day we had both taken our stupid-pills, so naturally we agreed to go and let Johnny lead the way there. "no one knows about this place... There's rarely anyone there." Johnny said as we walked our way down Wawa road to the Womens' Shelter, from where Johnny said he knew of a path or shortcut. We approached the hill which the Womens' Shelter sat atop and followed JW into the brush. Of course, I took an extra dose of my stupid pills that day and (uncharactaristically) left ill equipped for our short little excursion, bringing only a pocketnife and a waterbottle. So there we were, standing infront of about a mile of sticker bush... Come to think of it, it must have been September, or late summer, because the wild raspberries were fruiting and I had to explain to John that, not only were they not poisonous, but they actually tasted better than farm raised raspberries-- especially on Philiadelphia Style Vanilla ice cream. We managed to work our way through the labyrinth of thornberries, and make our way to train tracks, coated in a porous volcanic slag, which Johnny gave us a brief but interesting geological history of. I forget why the tracks were coated in it though-- probably had something to do with water runoff. As we walked down the tracks-- Kris and I recreating the "Lollipop" scene from Stand By Me, and myself expecting to see the decomposing body of young Ray Brauer as we neared the next bend-- Johnny described "The Cove" as he had done a million-trillion fucking times before: "It's awesome. It's an open area with a cliff. You look down and there's a huge drop to the water, where there's a big lagoon. There's creeks and streams all around and huge areas to swim." All the while, I furrowed my brow in my usual skeptical way (this look seems to have pasted itself to my fase, as I use it so much). How could that shit be here in Pennsylvania, I thought. Right here, less than 5 miles from the house I've lived in for 13 years, and I had no clue about it... I didn't expect a word he said to be true. Then we approached a large clearing, where from the distance we saw a group of young gradeschoolers, a dirtbike, and a few young 20-somethings drinking and smoking pot. We weren't sure whether the kids were with the 20-somethings. I had wanted to fall back as soon as I heard people down the path, because, as Johnny had described the place, it seemed like no one but guys like us or troublemakers would want to hang out there. My intuition told me to turn back, but the stupid-pills... We approached the group. "You girls goin' fer a swim?" Hotshot shouted at us., Johnny all the while trying to look like the toughest, most in-control 120 pounder he could manage to look like-- Kris, just being Kris. "No," I said, trying to be as brief and neutral as possible (I was fuming mad, because I knew what this was going to turn into, and I knew in my gut before the day started that this would happen.) "We're just hiking through." "Come onnn!" coaxed Captain Wife-Beater, swilling the beer can in his hand and wearing his best shit-eating grin. He wanted to give us a hard time, and he knew that I saw what he was thinking, which made him want to give us even more of a hard time. "Come onnn! You fucking bitches... Stick a finger in your pussy and jump in!" He must have said that five times because he thought it sounded intimidating or something, though all it did was prolong the awkwardness of the situation. Had I been alone, I may have been able to hike on through, or even stop for a breif conversation and maybe had a beer with the guy, but I was with the two biggest asshole magnets the town of Glen Mills had ever seen-- the situation got more uncomfortable. Johnny was trying to convey some sort of image, but fuck knows what it was. For christ's sake! All he was doing was acknowledging the awkwardness and showing his discomfort and lack of control-- Kris was just being Kris. And Wife-Beater saw this and played off of it some more. I noticed the kids standing around like townsfolk at high noon in an old spaghetti western, waiting for the showdown. Wife-Beater directed me to a ledge. I looked down, sure enough; there was a huge drop to the water, a big lagoon, and creeks and streams all around and huge areas to swim.  I'll be damned, I thought. "So jump in! Do it. Take your shorts off, stick a finger in your pussy, adn jump in!" Catch-Phrase said to me as I read on his face that he was planning to either push us in or steal our shit when we disrobed and jumped in. Johnny was getting ready to jump in and swim, but fuck him, I was leaving. I walked away, and Kris and Johnny followed. 30 yards passed under us as we heard a clicking at our heals, and I knew I didn't mistake tap shoes for my hiking boots. Mr. Sugarwalls was throwing rocks at us; so were his (ironically) stoned girlfriend, and some of the kids. Great! This wasn't over. They were big rocks, and the guys aim wasn't bad, so we hastened out of sight-- Shebop and his posse of white-trash followed. I could hear them on our trail, and since confrontation was the last thing any of us wanted (actually, Johnny still wanted to swim and get his clothes stolen), my friends relied on my ninja-like steath and evasion tactics to keep us out of sight. Dr. Jellyfinger and his gang weren't going to try to fight us or anything like that, but they were definitely going to be a pain in our asses, and I was more afraid of that. I lead us down a hidden fork and hid us in, as luck would have it, a patch of stinging nettles, as the punks passed over the bridge above our heads, oblivious to our whereabouts and making teasing cat-calls. After a while we found a trail and followed it to a sign... and a parking lot... "Yada-Yada-Yada- DARLINGTON WOODS-bla-bla-bla" the sign read. I stood there choking back my verbal attack as I realized the "supersecluded Cove" that Johnny had led us to was actually a state-fucking-park (not to mention that sticking to roads would have gotten us there quicker and easier than fighting our way through the raspberries). I saw a road and wanted to walk it to see where we were. I walked it a bit, then crossed it to take a piss on a hill-- Johnny and Kris stayed back. Though I wanted to continue walking down the road, the two dimwits called me back, and being just as dimwitted, I crossed the road again to yell at them that I wanted to find out where we were-- and just in fucking time too. Professor Fingerbang and his crew of lumbering fools were making their way up the trail looking for us. We were off the trail by about two feet and in some thick brush, all bunched together when we heard them coming five feet away. I just sighed and made an attempt to turn back to the road-- I just didn't give a shit any more. Just then Johnny decided that he didn't want to pretend to be cool, calm, and collected. He must have been tired of trying to look tough, like we weren't being stalked through the woods by a malicious wigger with an overbite. He wanted to be scared now, and what a great time for that. He flailed his arms at a thousand RPM and pushed Kris to move to the road. Kris, in turn, pushed me, and in his stumbling he managed to step on the heel of my slip-on shoe, removing it from my foot. As I fumbled for my shoe Johnny continued his flailing but added to it a high pitched squeal, like that of a frightened rat. Frank Wank and his merry men were just standing there, their jaws dropped in a stupified awe. We made it to the road, Johnny and Kris panicking. We stood at the road for a bit as our pursuer heckled us from the brush... He didn't need to do that. I was already humiliated enough.
