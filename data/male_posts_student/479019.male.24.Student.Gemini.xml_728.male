It's like that article on Ink19.com I read many months ago explained.  You know we live in a pretty screwed up world. So the death toll in post-war Iraq is up to 200+, we have Saddam captured, Michael Jackson is formally charged with child molestation, there are continued tensions between China and Taiwan, kids continue to be exploited in factories, etc. There's all that shit going on in the world and at the same time most of us are more concerned with our daily human emotions such as loneliness, desire, anger, sorrow, lust and hate. It's like you wonder if the micro level alienation and anomie reflects how on the global level our species gets more and more stupid. If we can't even take care of our day to day lives, how are we able to end world hunger, the AIDS pandemic, and have peace?   I recommend all of you listen to  Bad Religion 's "American Jesus."  I really think that if I hadn't started listening to Bad Religion in 1993-1994, my freshman year of high school, I wouldn't have ended up in sociology.   ***
