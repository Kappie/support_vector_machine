The first time (this is one secret which only one person knows until now) I fell in love with some one who did the choir i used to go to. I fell in love with her (because then i was not sure whether i was gay or not) and the second was with Louis. Now both of these people hurt me so badly because of this little feeling LOVE. Love it seems to eat at us. I think LOVE causes more problems that nearly any other feeling. Ok Kind of sidetracking from the subject here. I want to have a b/f i really want one or maybe just another gay person i can talk to. I hate having to talk to st8 people all the time( no offence but no one who is st8 knows what this is like at all! i still love u guys but....) I mean i will have to wait ages to get one. And i know i am not the world most attractive person and i am not fit at all but having someone would be nice. I mean i go to partys and everyone kisses but what can i do sit and watch GREAT! And even if i did get a boyfriend we would not be able to do anything in public like holdhands or kiss at partys cos of people. And people say that words can never hurt you but this is not true. Words hurt more than anything else. Words hurt more than kicking and hitting and things. Words can stay with you for your life time. Thing people say are like bullets they hit you and you cant get rid of them they stick with you forever. I mean sometimes people use them as throw down comments which they forget about and when you say something u can see the hurt on their face as u say it. I mean when people at school they say things about gay people and they know it hurts me so badly and they still carry on. These comment hurt me so much. There is this guy called Samir, He hates gay people and he goes on about how much he hates them and how mu ch they should all die and how he hates them and how it is disgusting. And then all these people like when i say i fancy that guy they laugh at me. This little things hurt me so badly  TODAY today I had a fall out with a friend who i have known for ages but who i cant trust (cos he goes to my school and i cant trust anyone who goes to my school!). I told louis this thing about me friend (which i dont belive is true) and he had a go at me and then he said that i did it cos i thought he told my brother which aparently he didnt (but i trust jess who tole me that he did soo...) and he said that jess was someone who didnt know him and how i couldnt trust him was bad. After this i couldnt take anymore and i ran off and cried in the loos (how strong am i) and since then i have cried all day! great day today then hey??
