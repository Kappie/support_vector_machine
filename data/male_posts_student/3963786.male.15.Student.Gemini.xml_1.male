It didn't work. In the end I was too untrustworthy to be loved. I'm not mad at her, not in the slightest. I'm only upset with myself for messing up in the first place. Now we can't even be friends, I think we could be, but she doesn't. I really don't want to have to put her out of my life, but I can respect her wishes. I guess I'm never going to see her again, outside of school next year. We can look at each other and pretend like it never happened. The only upside about all this is that now I don't have to worry about if she's better off with or without me, she didnt seem to have any trouble answering that question. The thing that made me saddest was that near the end of the conversation, she said she was happy that this was ending. Halfway through the conversation she told meshe thought she might have loved me, and it felt like someone had taken a knife to my heart. But I realized at the end of the conversation that if she can actually be happy this is ending, then it never was love. I told her this, along with some other harsh words at the end. I now wish I hadn't. I don't know how hard she took these words, but I think she was just trying to be strong. I think I can now feel how she did. I'll put something in here, it's what I wrote last night. It's still crap, I'm not quite back to how I used to be, but I think I'm getting there.   FALLEN ANGEL  Torn at the seams My world is divided Stripped of it's wings the angel is blinded The once glorious and admired fallen to Earth Walking amongst us, walking in fire His limitless ambitions now burdened with restrictions The homeless purity reduced to crime no longer able to pass judgement his own convictions, has mimed once beloved once banished he looks at the world with his new 3rd eye seeing this is where he must live this is where he must die burst into tears he begins his eternal weep silenced only to those whocannot not to hear so their sanity, they may keep for the cry of an angel was not meant to be heard
