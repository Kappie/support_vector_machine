I get back from the hospital and I get a call from Ponderosa saying they want me to come in for a interview. Now how fucked up is that. Oh well Terry says I can call and we'll reschedule when Ifeel better, so I'm doing that today. I mean, my throat still hurts and I have a slight headache, but nothing is perfect, and I really need the job. I told Bri that if didn't feel any better than yesterday, I wouodn't go, but everyone is getting sick, and he can't afford it. At least if I have a job,I can back up what he loses. I" already giving him $36 for the money he lost when he came to the hospital in the middle of his shift. I'm just hoping Ponderosa pays well:) Gotta go shopping...anyway, my eyes are starting to bug out from looking at this stupid screen, so I'll see ya'll later:) *hugs kisses and a little extra*  V
