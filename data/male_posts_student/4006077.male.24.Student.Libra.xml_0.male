Since no labels exist above, let's forget about the whole thing shall we?  It is conference time at TACF, a place blessed wonderfully by God.  In fact, my sister an I are getting along quite well after 8 years here and if you had asked, no, I don't think that would have been possible without Divine Intervention.  But then there is the issue of work.  It has been too long of course, and really, you'd have to be daft to not realize it is your time to go (leave that is).  I feel it in my fingers, I feel it in my toes.  Or is it bones?  No, really, I am not deft.  I can hear in recordings what perhaps my co-worker (who may or may not have 20+ years on me) cannot.  But, does that mean I am deft?  Rightly, this whole post has been about nothing other than badminton, naturally.  You can ask any of my fellow badminton clubbers that actually, my skills are far from deft.  I have 3 raquets, two are yonex.  I use no capitals in that sentence because both raquets are the sub-100$ type.  In fact, one is after tax, a mere 2/3 of that.  The other one is a Fleet.  Not a FLEET, because not even one exists that I know that would require caps.  Caps in that case would be perhaps a  urlLink 300$ plus racquet .  And what would I do, I who disgrace even a 53$ 8200 light do with one?  Certainly not play.  Well, not any better than now.  It would be far too much power in my hand (right).  The most expensive and (and perhaps durable at that) raquet that Fleet manufactures is 170$ CDN up to 200$.  Well, mine is the 4/7 part of the last price type.  It is incredibly Sexy, though not entirely SEXY.  That is, it is not 80g with strings that ring in well over 30$.  But the grey mesh speaks for itself.  Yes, that mesh is titanium and well, if you are a fisher(man/woman) then you will be thrilled of hearing of any sort of net.    Good evening to all of me that is still fractured.  Today was looking through old photos, and my first girfriend as well popped up there.  I guess just looking was enough to say that somehow I miss her still.  Those photos are now in the dustbin.  Which is where some memories though good need to remain.  So, it took me over 2.5 years to do that, is that a measure of loss or what?  I am not deft in healing 'guess so.    From what you can imagine, this has not had much to do with "The Union" to which I belong, but I promise you that despite I have not mention that we "have" 37509 members, we are graceful to the "little guy" -- who happens to be Dave Pietre in this case, but in other cases, it may be someone else.
