It's quite hard to get back into the habit of updating this thing. But I shall make the effort. Over my holiday I came up with numerous things to talk about, and attemted to remember said things. And failed. Failed miserably.  At some point, really soon now... I'll post on the following:      C++     Dell     EA     Microsoft     Linux     Game Physics     My Futile Existence     Cats    And anything else I think of. So that's just over a week, if I post each day. Starting tomorrow.  In the mean time, go get Dev-C++ from Bloodshed software. Then get some tutorials.  -- Dom Out
