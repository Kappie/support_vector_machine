I slacked for the rest of the day till bout' evening time. My whole family was out by tt time, so I decided to go out as well.  I went to seach for a new school bag as my current one had a hole. My keys were nearly lost once, but luckily tt hole wasn't big enough for my keys to escape. Unfortunately, it has now become bigger. I went to west mall first den to jurong point. At jurong point, there were more shops to look for bags. There were shops like Converse, World of Sports, Royal Sporting House and All Bags. There were at least 1 bag in each shop tt I liked, but I decided to get the Adidas bag frm All Bags. It cost me $26, but I thought it was pretty worth it. I oso saw this Fila pouch in All Bags tt I realli liked, but I couldn't buy it. I had to save money to buy fat pussy cat's soccer boots. *Sighz* Haha.  I came back to Bukit Batok Interchange and had my dinner at Mac. I proceeded home after tt and nobody was home yet. Haha, so I was first to return back home. I took a shower and came online to blog. At the same time, I'm oso watchin Simple Life on Chan 5, kindda lame reality tv programme. L0L! Well, tt's bout' it for today. Cya ard~ =]
