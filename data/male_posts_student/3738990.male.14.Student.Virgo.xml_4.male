Tie me up with the sheets to the bed Smother me with a pillow Cut me with knives and forks Drag me across the lounge-room floor By my hair as I suck up the dirt With the vacuum cleaner Pin me to the wall with your Toyota Steal MY T.V. remote Let me hear the sound of one hand slapping Drink your beer while we make love But just DON'T call me fat.
