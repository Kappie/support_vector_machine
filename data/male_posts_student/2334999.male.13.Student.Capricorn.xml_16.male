But i cant sleep or else I would'nt be able to fall asleep 2nite and ill be even more tired and lethargic tomorrow morning. But on the positive side, i got PC Gamer's September issue today :D and Lime and 2 other books (from MPH) namely, The Supernaturalist by Eoin Colfer and The Armor of Light by Thomas L and Boey M.H. Its the first part of a trilogy set after the death of King Arthur. Its a fantasy novel with mages, spellcasters and swordsman. Lotsa reading to do... Have to finish up my Warcraft: War of the Ancients trilogy, The Well of Eternity. I'm only half way through it. No time to read :S Still have lotsa homework to do but thxfully, they're due the day after...  Whee, and I also bought a new deo, some gatsby ice note thingy... Makes u feel cool (literally) when you're really hot (literally, as in temperature hot, warm). Was receiving complaints about the nivea one... Bah, sunday afternoons sux... Cos you just get that horrible feeling of dread when you're just 12-18 hrs away from going back to sch.... And sundays are for u to finish up your homework :S
