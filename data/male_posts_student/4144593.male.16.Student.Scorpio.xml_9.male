It proved to be another stupid decision by edmund cuz we reach there only to be grilled by the afternoon sun. Sat rite at the last row of the yellow section. Dun wanna tok bout the parade since most ppl would have seen it on tv already. So let fast forward to the fireworks !!! Yeah i lov the fireworks.  But since we were in the last row, the marshals gave us umbrallas to sheild us from the fallin fireworks. 4 of us had to squeese into a small pathetic umbrella so niao gu. But the wait was worth it, the fire works were great, much longer and nicer than the fireworks on sunday at marina. Got quite a number of photos of the fireworks, my photoshootin skills not veri good but i guess they r passable. I love fireworks............
