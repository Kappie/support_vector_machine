I'm now legally allowed to lots of things, like buy cigarettes, and...  ...lottery tickets! ;) Most people gave me money, which is no bad thing I suppose. I'm also getting lots of clothes from my Dad (have to look super-stylish for college) and a personal organising thing from my Mum (for when I forget to go to college and my efforts in style are rendered pointless). Went out to Pizza Hut for some food, I'll probably organise some bowling action for next week with my friends. Go 16!
