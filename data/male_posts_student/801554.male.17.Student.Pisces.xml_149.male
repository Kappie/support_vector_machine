Watched Bushie's press conference this evening (how could you miss it), and I was amazed at the utter waste of time it was. Every question was basically avoided and brought back to several key mantras. I especially liked how he said he wasn't planning on loosing his job. Guess what buddy, majority rules. And most likely this time, the supreme court won't toss the highest office in the country to you, Mr. I-like-to-pause-between-words.  God, I wish I could vote in that election.  Also a comment on my media viewing habits. The only TV station I watch for news is C-Span. Non-biased, non-partisan. And I love how they realize that the public owns the airwaves and put viewer calls on the air. For all other news I go to Google. There you get a good look at what is going on without all that slant. And NPR. NPR is good.
