My heart goes out to those people. The lonely and the heartached.  This life is just a drop in eternity, yet we have the power to influence so many drops that we can change the course of eternity. Make it better.  Thanks Martha. Your right, I do need to smile more. I'll try.  I've just lost sight of everything important recently, and I'm trying to find my bearings.
