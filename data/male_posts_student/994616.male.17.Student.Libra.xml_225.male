If it cracks (and reveals three blank CDs and aniTunes Logo, and you fall on to a beach) it works. If you can't tell, i'm writing out my drems. I walked along this beach where i saw a mayan group of people doing something. i was kinda scared so i walked faster. Then realised i was waist deep in water so i yelled at the aboriginal groupd of people i was by "Little help?" The quickly obliged and took me into their area. Apparently there was a burial thing going on, hence and we had to lean over the water and do something, but i didn't know what and got kinda confused. Every one seemed happy though, so that was good. We then proceeded to sit down to a meal of mexican food - nachos tacos burritos etc. Later i left (and somehow appeared at the entrance to the wildlife park with Caroline and Erin)  We were going to go back to the camp so i could show it to them. There was a big sign sying something along the lines of "if you see any cockroaches please kill them for us, every little bit helps." We continued walking (and killing) untill we  eventually Erin dissapeared and we ended up at a little sitting eating area where there was a playground carved out of a rock. Now i think we ran into a famous children's book author. Caroline dissapears, something happens with children's books and colours, and then i'm in caroline's passenger seat recounting much of the experience to her. Then i pause and go "wait - you're driving - does that mean you got your Ps?" "yep, with a big grin" "then i give her a big hug while she's driving and she sweves a bit because of it.   The other dream is decidedly less remembered  We, my family and I, were on an elevator on a cruise ship that was also carrying some prisoners.Anyways we decided to sleep in an empty room towards the bottom of the ship (no I don't know why) At some late part of the night some people sneaked in to an empty room down the hall. We went to investigate. it sounded like they were planning to take over the ship! That's when they heard us. We then tried to hide, but they knew where we went so they threw some knives at us. I think they had a never ending ammount. After a while of this my brother did something that reminded them of some hero, whom they all stopped to remember for a few seconds, which gave us a chance to escape.
