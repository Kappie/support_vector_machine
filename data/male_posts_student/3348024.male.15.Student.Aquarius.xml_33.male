I think one of the funnier moments occured at about 3 am.  Amber was goin a little crazy with the ice and stuck an ice cube down my pants.  Naturally, I kept it there for about twenty seconds because understandably, it gets really hot in my pants so an ice cube once in a while feels good.  After about twenty seconds, I declared, "My hands are in my pants," and grabbed the ice cube.  I then walked over to amber and rubbed it in her face and she took it and stuck it in Matt, her boyfriends mouth.  Good fun... Good fun.  TBC... I'm fuckin tired.
