Read the article  urlLink here (BBC),  urlLink here (Scotsman), or  urlLink here (Guardian).   Metcalfe had been suspended from his teaching and housemaster role since April 2003 ( urlLink school press release ) pending the results of the police investigation and any subsequent prosecution.  Monday's  urlLink press release  from the school,  "hopes that the matter is now finally closed."  Was this a poor choice of words, press officer?  Or does the school really hope that the matter is  finally closed .  I presume the school mean that they hope justice has been adequately served, rather than a hope for an end to negative publicity, irrespective of a fair trial.  Interestingly the Scotsman said  "Winchester Crown Court was told that the Crown Prosecution Service did not believe there was a  reasonable prospect  of a  conviction  and offered no evidence against Mr Metcalfe." and "He is now expected to be reinstated."  The BBC was perhaps kinder stating  "the prosecution would offer no evidence against him...He had faced three charges of assault and ill-treatment of a child."   It is interesting the way a story can be spun.  Metcalfe is presumed innocent as no case has been made against him, and his reputation is thus unblemished, but the Scotsman appears to spin that fact into an article that almost suggests the prosecution couldn't be bothered to argue their case (or indeed the 3 young adults are no longer willing to face the humiliation of testifying). Internally there has been little public fanfare or indeed any acknowledgement at all.  This has been too much of a headache for too long, I suspect. One don said to his set on Monday afternoon  Mr. Metcalfe has been cleared of any wrongdoing, and his name is completely clean... I always  knew  he was innocent, and I am glad this has come to an end for him. I'm sure if any of us were innocent of such charges, we would also be pleased to be acquited.  But, how can you "know" someone is innocent of a crime in which you yourself were not privy.  Especially when it comes down to issues of "assault" and "ill-treatment of a child"?  Like all such child-related matters, the mere fact that someone acts professionally to colleagues and appears to be a "good-bloke" doesn't ensure that he is (or isn't) innocent.  Undoubtedly, there will be a few in the school who remember what it was like to be in Metcalfe's house, and it is surely them to whom we should turn for a character reference - I certainly am no expert. -- Bizarrely I've just noticed that if you search Google Groups for "Winchester College" you find some strange posts (no. 3 or 4) relating to Peter somebody.  Add Peter to your search  urlLink query  (or indeed metcalfe), and you get back the strangest reports and accusations from a few years ago.  Anybody have any idea of what that's about?
