I started the tutorial missions with meager interest only to discover how cool and interesting it was! So here i present it to you.   The name of the game is Netstorm. It is an old title made by Activion wich is now an abandonware (Means that the full version is downloadable on the net at no fee in total legality). Netstorm is a Real Time Strategy with 2d graphics in a fictional fantasy world. It is a little bit difficult to explain. Try the early missions yourself and see if you like it. I love!  NetStorm(15.8Mo)(executable install file) is available right here :  ( http://www.netstormhq.com/download.php?view.1 )   By the way, it as a big feel of Starcraft and Magics The Gathering combined. Have a look and forge your opinion!   Paulo lended me a bit of stuff yesterday. -Pokemon Silver for GameBoy Color -GameBoy Camera -around 20 Dvds for my parents to watch   Thanks Paulo for all these, i guess i'll be busy for quite a while :-)   Also i tried to play a little bit with the comments.
