I have two houses that I live in, but no home. I am overwhelmed by school and society. I have had thoughts of suicide. I have had extremely violent thoughts. I have been confused. I have been walked on. I have been persecuted for my beliefs. I have been told I am nothing but property. I mean nothing until I'm eighteen, yet I am expected to one day give to this society. I have witnessed terrible things. I have been lied to by my loved ones. I have been rejected. I have cried. I live in the wealthiest, most powerful country in the world. I'm told that myself and my generation are to lead this country in the future.           .........thanks for the childhood, assholes.
