Today was a rather memorable day, having met a lot of peepz in the local ID scene, and had a mass makan session with them.. it was very enjoyable.    Met Aaron at the arcade at around 1.30 pm. he was playing some ID, so i thought i might go play some Wangan before i go with him to the second floor, where Seoul Garden is. met KC, Channon, Wayzik, Gwen, and a lot of other peepz... after that we went in and just whacked the food hard.... we took up a total of 5 tables, and were like so noisy throughtout the time we were there. Enjoyed the food, the self grilling, and got a little oil splats on my hand, and had great conversations with them.. even though they just knew me. Loved it. They were very friendly and a great bunch to hang out with.    After that we proceeded down to the arcade again, to play Wangan. i successfully completed my second round of story mode, and is on my way to full tuning my R34, wads left is 1 more round of playing the CPU, and i'm ready to take on challengers. My card name changed to The Steel Wind, and it sounded very strong, haha.    Headed to Atrium after that, and played some ID. As usual, i couldnt break any times. felt vexed at the way things are going... wasting money and couldnt see results. bleah. After that some of the peepz went up to see the movie King Arthur, but i stayed behind and watched all the way to around 10.15pm, and went home after that. Got to know Zheng Long, a member of X-T who lived very near me... just 2-3 blocks away.    Told my mum how i felt these days, she just said the usual stuff, try hard, dun waste money. and get urpriorites correct. i knew it all long ago. just that, i didnt have the heart, the mood to do it. Well i guess i have and got to pick up from where i left off, otherwise this semester, i'll be darn screwed big time.    After meeting Aaron for the first time today after talking to him so much on MSN, this is the first time i had a meal together with him. Or rather, same location, but 3 tables away. I kinda guessed that he was not wanting to sit with me due to the empty seats (i did feel a little sense of pung seh, when i hey-ed to him and he didnt look back, but i wont blame him) , and it would be occupied my Melissa and Zhi Sheng... the couple now, but the girl Aaron lov-ED. I felt he became kinda more depressed and disappointed when i told him how Zhi Sheng (Shiro), told mel that he was staring at her... He did tell me later at atrium, he just couldnt believe it. The words Shiro said.And yet, he cant do anything about it.    This situation was kinda confirmed when about now, i've seen his entry for his blog today, and it was a entry full of emotions. His phrase, '   I know I'm not any handsome suave young guy girls would fall for, but certainly, I'm human too. I've my emotions. I know my limits, but please God, stop fooling with my life anymore. I'm on the brink of death and destruction.  ',really pulled out what i've got to sayin this period of my life, and thanks to u, Aaron, i certainly didnt know what to type, but this, is really my point, that i have in my heart. Thanks a lot for putting it into words. I've been a bit too messed up these daysthat my previous entries was all kinda single-worded (i did notice it.. but my vocab couldnt pull anything else out) , darkness, lonliness, and all.. i know my english isnt as good as yours, and i, definitely couldnt express it out better than you. Thanks again.   Guess thats about it, had some time to think of stuff on the way home, on the bus, and felt verymessed upabout it. Still,nothing's been going right, and darkness is all around. What can i say, thats how my life is now.    Night peeps. Benedict out.
