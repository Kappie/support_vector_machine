My English teacher is borderline retarded, and she managed to impress me with her retardism...  See, you would think that with less than a month left of school that a teacher would know the names of their students.  Not Ms. Grande.  This isn't anything new, but it just never ceases to surprise me when she does this.  At this point you are wondering what exactly did she do.  Well she was in the middle of handing out parts for this play that we are reading so she is reading off names when she gives a name of a student that does not exist.  Now not only did we lack a student with this name in our class, I am almost positive that in her other junior class the student does not exist.  So when nobody said anything she yelled at the girl with the name that sounded closest to the name that she actually said.  Yesterday and today have been pretty uneventful, but one thing that is a continuing trend is the absence of my biology teacher.  I think that this is the 3rd week of school that she has been absent for my class, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  Of course our new room is a big closet (no windows).  Now that will drive you insane real quick.  I don't know what I'm going to do in that class, because not only does it lack windows but it also lacks cell service.  Now I really doubt that I will ever do an ounce of work in that class even with no windows or cell service.  I think that I'll just give the teacher a blank stare when she gets back.  Oh and that final is going to be a failure.  Not just for me though, the entire class.  So with a curve that could give us all an A.  Not a bad deal, hell I'd take it.  Well this is pretty long.  I kinda like this blog thing.
