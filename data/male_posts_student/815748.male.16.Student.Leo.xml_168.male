Like two days ago in French, I was in Melody's group for this thing where we had to come up with sentences for idiomatic expressions, and I thought she spelled something wrong (turns out I was wrong), so when I was "fixing" it, I was trying to make it look like girl handwriting, so I put a little heart over the "i" and then Mme DeRobert came over and was like what the so I was like, don't all girls do that?  That was funny.  Then yesterday in French, we finished writing our trial skit for  L'Etranger , and our group and another group kept covertly swiping and swiping back my French-English dictionary.  And we ended up with a good skit; I won't say what was funny about it because at least one reader (of five) is in my French class.  Guess which.  Ooo, tough.  English today was...interesting...   This looks like an orgy to me! --- Ms. Kranes    Then history was good, Somers and I were in a group together which has never happened before.  We were for "Promot[ing] Western Values" in the Middle East.  When Loren heard what I was supporting, he was like, figures, and I was like it's such chino thinking the one he was doing, which was like suppress everyone with the military.  Then he did an impression of an Arab person, and was like, "Can I..." and the military goes "No!" and starts beating him up.  During lunch, Melody referred to Loren as "the skinny Chinese kid."  That was weird.  After school, I got myself a haircut at that Newtonville place.  Go sexy-haired me.  And no more seniors...   Does "C" exist on the periodic table? --- Ms. Srikanth    I am sexually interested in you. -- Matt Woolf ,  to me
