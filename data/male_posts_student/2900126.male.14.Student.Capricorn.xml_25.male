It was kinda fun because we were walking and Sonya tried to teach me "The Six Ways Not To Get Jumped When Walking In East Gate At Night"    #1.) don't act crazy  #2.) walk with your head down and put your hood on if u have a hoodie   #3.) if you see people walking towards you keep walking and don't talk to them  #4.)if you walk at night avoid people in big groups and people with metal poles   #5.) if they don't stop walking towards you run .....................for your life   AND NUMBER SIX, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL ...... #6.) be sarcastic, the ghetto people in East Gate don't understand sarcasm they take what you say literally   #7.) don't practice self-defense if they continue to approach you hand over all your money.
