What makes me remember this is that all day at work I've been playing a little word/mind game for myself.  Here's how you too can play the Tim's A Pervert Game! After anything and everything you or someone else says, just imagine them (or you) saying, "... in bed!" at the end of it. It works with everything. I think.   Hey Caleb, good to see you... in bed!  Hey Caleb, keep up the good job... in bed!   Yeah... Tim has issues.  And for all you faithful fans who have been commenting (faithfully) on the blog, you have my eternal thanks and boundless love! However, I suck, and I haven't been reading them lately, but with more free time and a computer up at work, I'll be checking in rather frequently. So jabber at me... in bed!
