Let this serve as a warning to those who try to get me to do new things. (Those who aren't reading webcomics, sometimes they're funny, but a lot of the time they aren't. Just a warning.)  My teeth still hurt and nobody has posted in three days. I'm just sayin'...  It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!
