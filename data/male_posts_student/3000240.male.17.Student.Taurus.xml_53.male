Should be good, last time I went to a party there I came home with hickeys and I can vividly remember the elaborate pulling between Rachael and Frances (Never laughed so much in my life apart from when Paul tried to chat up a 90 year old woman in the swan once I suppose). Saturday is still a blur really apart from Chelsea playing Manure at Old Trafford. Quite confident that we will be pissed of and lay the final nail in United's season. Well a good end to the week in football terms would be gladly welcome.   Have fun wHeReVeR yOuR gOiNg. xBuBzx
