Anyway, very tired. VERY, very tired. But contented. Talking to Fi. She's nice. It's unfair that Fi, Nikky, and Laura are all really nice. Some of their nicitude should be shared with people who are bitches. Silliness. Total silliness. Although, only Fi's on, which is a blessing in itself, but I was going to talk to Laura... no offence meant, I've just known Laura for longer, and I also want to work out whether I'm going to be able to go with her to this Thursday thingamabibble.   Aach. Really tired, I can't blog much more. Missing talking to Laura, a day's break seems to be too long.  Quote of the day: "Guide me, O thou great redeemer, Pilgrim through this barren land. I am weak, but thou art mighty, Hold me in thy powerful hand."  From the hymn   Bread of Heaven   Love, Jon Roskilly
