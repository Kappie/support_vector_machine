Conservatives must be wary of appearing callous and cruel, while Liberals have to be wary of being way too granola and weak on defense. I think any smart politician is aware of this.  So what's up with John?   I believe I can fight a more effective, more thoughtful, more strategic, more proactive,   more sensitive   war on terror that reaches out to other nations and brings them to our side and lives up to American values in history.    Regardless of what he meant, does he really want to tie the words 'sensitive' and 'war' together in one neat little bundle? Are the American people interested in being 'sensitive' as we try to protect our way of life?  Keep talking John. I thought Bush had the monopoly on entertaining speech.
