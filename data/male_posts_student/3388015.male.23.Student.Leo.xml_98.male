I hung out with the cat and had a quiet Friday night.  I took some garbage out to the dumpster and I saw the stairstepper that had been there for over a week.  So I got on it thinking I could perhaps use it if there wasn't anything wrong with it.  I went inside to get a flashlight to check it out further and when I came back outside, it was gone.  Not moved, not thrown out.. it was gone!  Within 2 minutes.  That's crazy.  Saturday I woke up late and cleaned a bit before Cindy and I headed to my grandmother's place for a 4th of July picnic.  We got there around 4 and stayed until 8.  We went to the Outlets and shopped for awhile.  I got a shirt, pants and shorts for my trip.  We came back to Rochester, Cindy got her alcohol and we drank the night away.  Alison came over and stayed until 1:30 or so.  Cindy spent most of the night on the floor.  It was fun.
