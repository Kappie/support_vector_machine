(Don't worry I will be purchasing the Album the day it is on the shelf!) Since I've started listening to "Where You Want To Be" it has not left my CD player. Though it lacks the mind blowing poetry which John Nolan took with him when he left Taking Back Sunday, it still rings quality whichI encourage you viewers to get your hands on.    The eleven track album consists of many new songs, which include the upcoming single, "A Decade Under the Influence" and "This Photograph is Proof (I know You Know)," which can also be found on the Spiderman 2 Soundtrack.    If you can't wait for the 27th, and you have no way of getting a pirated version of "Where You Want To Be" you can check out the entire CD on mtv.com. From July 20th-27th, mtv.com is hosting "The Leak," a free stream of the new album. Here's the links to the two mtv sites hosting the stream:  urlLink mtv2.com    urlLink mtvu.com . You can also check out the new Taking Back Sunday video, "A Decade Under The Influence" at the TBS web page,  urlLink takingbacksunday.com .    "Where You Want To Be" is almost here, andI strongly encourage you to go buy it. I give it a7.8/10.  Until Next Time, Good morning, good evening, and good night.
