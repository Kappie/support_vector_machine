You’ve been worrying about your faith for quite some time. I know you have, I’ve been watching. You no longer see the point. No reason to get caught up in religion and the such. There’s no room for individualism there. Sit. Kneel. Obey. You don’t like the idea of it all. I know you still believe in God. I know you still feel guilty in the middle of the night, while laying there awake, looking back on all the thing you’ve done. I know you still believe enough not to say there is no God. You know there is a God. However, religion, like all things, is man-made. This is what you believe, isn’t it? And so, if it’s man-made, how can it be perfect? How can it be true?   Once, you were so strong there. So much passion. So much love. Now what have you got? So much hate. So much rage. Apathy. Lethargy. All of that. And more. Or less. You hate organized religion. I know you do; I can feel it in you. The councils. The education. The politics. They’re not better there than anyone else in the world. They’re not any better. No, organized religion is not for you. Or for anyone, really. That’s just what they’re adjusted to. The world hates change.   I know you still need to worship. So you occasionally go back there, to their building, to their House of God. You go to celebrations, like Christmas, like Easter. And you still go a few Sundays a month. It can’t ruin you that way. I know, because I’ve seen it. I’ve seen you sitting there, reflecting quietly in your room. Your faith is pure there, with no one else around. No priest and his message. No Vatican Voodoo. Nobody with a show put on, singing, dancing, praying, just so everyone can see them and say “Boy, are they ever a good Christian”. No. Maybe your faith isn’t as strong as theirs. But then again, it might be, because it’s true.    What do you WANT to be when you grow up, really not actually. (astronaut, actor, mime, stripper, ballerina) I don't really have any definate plans on what I want to be when I grow up, I just want to be happy and successful with whatever I do.    How do you respond to these worldly issues? War-  The only purpose of war is to boost the ego of those in power. Sometimes, I guess war is justified, when there is a real threat. Most of the time though, war is useless. The war in Iraq, for example. Sure, "the good guys" won, and they did it quickly, but what you don't see is how many innocent people died to remove a dictator who gave them free healthcare and free education.  Poverty-  Poverty is an inescapable side effect of capitalism.   Gay marriage-  I think that people should be albe to do whatever they want, so long as they are not harming anyone else. Sure, gay people should be allowed to get married and live long and happy lives together. By "allowed to get married", I mean by a judge or a ship's captain. Catholics, Christians, they're allowed to believe whatever they want, and if they don't want to marry gays, then they shouldn't have to. New laws that are coming into effect could technically send priests to jail for refusing to marry gay couples. That is wrong. As long as there is some sort of legal binding, like with a judge, then that should suffice.  Legalizing Marijuana-  Again, people should be allowed to do whatever they desire, so long as they aren't harming other people. In a basement, in a garage, sure, why not. If you want to pollut yourself like that, then fine, have at it. However, it should carry laws that would make it illegal to be stoned in public, especially around areas like playgrounds and schools and the such.   What does your faminly look like in the future? (Spouse, children, pet,etc.) I would like to be married somewhere between the age of 21 and 25, but do not desire children until at least 3 or 4 years after that. I'd rather wait a little while and be financially stable before starting a family, not just so I can drive a nice car instead of an old beater truck, but also so my children have the opportunity to attend which ever school they want, wherever they want. And so my family and I have the opportunity to spend time together like holidays and such. I want to live in an average house with a paved driveway and a basketball hoop. Maybe even a dog.    Are you a party animal or a classy swindig kinda person? I have my moments of both, but if I had to choose, I'd probably pick black tie events over a night in the club or some house party.    If you could have any car or truck in the world, what would it be? 2003 Monte Carlo or 2003 Mitsubishi Lancer.    What would you do if you won the lottery? Spend none of it, invest in a few business ventures and build a business empire (damn capitalism, eh?).    What does your fantasy wedding look like? Whatever my bride to be and the wedding planner come up with.
