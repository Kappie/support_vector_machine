Unless your one of those kids who think church is fun. Yesterday night I was so bored I actually went out. Runaway Jury was actually a pretty good movie. HOWEVER, I almost died/puked/passed out at the cinema. The lady I sat next to was at least 300lbs and had the absolute worst body odor I have ever smelled. Absolutely horrible. Anyway, the movie was really good. Congradulation's to Neil and his website for making it Hazleton big! Click on the link on the right to view this outstanding website. Hmm, I need a different adjective. Funny? No.. Odd? No... Just go to KindergartenBabble and you think of one yourself.
