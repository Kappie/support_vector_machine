School doesn't start until Friday, but I assumed this was some generic "senior initiation" thing.  As it turns out, that wasn't the case. Thursday is the 8th grader's initiation. The only reason a senior would go is if he signed up for the Big Brother/Big Sister program where you basically have to babysit the 8th graders and let them follow you around at lunch and after school.  I didn't sign up for this. But that doesn't matter.  Our principal, Ms. Hall, making great strides towards making the school look good to everyone else while making the students feel miserable, has made this program  manditory.  So now, I'm forced to drag whoever this kid'll be around everywhere and be forced to "show him the ropes", as it were.  I feel bad for the kid though; I don't DO a hell of a lot outside of classes. Sure, in class I'll be doing all kinds of spontanious and interesting things, but lunch and afterschool is devoted to relaxing, listening to music, and sometimes doing the school work I neglected to do in class. Other kids are in band, or in sports, or one of those weird abstract clubs that do things for the community. Me? I lounge around in the math teacher's room and doodle while everyone else practices academic games. Not very interesting for the little bright eyed 8th grader.  It's not the first change Ms. Hall's brought about this year. The vending machines will now be shut down for most of the day. In fact, they made it as sort of a competition now to see if you can get a candy bar or not. The vending machines (including drink dispensers) will be on for only twice a day for 10 minutes and at, more or less, the most inconvient times possible. So now the revenue on the machines will go down, and they'll be gone for good. But that's ok, because the lunches there are really good.   Oh wait.  They got rid of all the lunches in place of "archdiocese approved" lunches. Say hello to frozen two-fer patties stored in the back rooms for about 3 months! =D  Well, I'll live. Worse comes to worse, I'll bring in my own bag lunches full of all the crap I could possibly want, while everyone else chokes on 4 month old stale chicken nuggets with the consitancy of a skipping stone. I won't be sharing any of my lunch with the 8th grader though; the little bugger has to learn to fend for himself in the wilderness of High School.
