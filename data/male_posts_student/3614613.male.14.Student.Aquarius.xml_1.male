I now begin my apology to Tan Li Lin  (her blog) in order to please her royal highness:  Dear Finest Woman On Earth (a.k.a Tan Li Lin)  I humbly ask for your forgiveness, for disregarding your feelings at that particular moment of time, whereby I have created a picture, depicting your face upon a picture of a body builder. I was not thinking clearly and was extremely bored at that point of time, therefore creating that picture. So I'm wracked with guilt, hoping you don't tell your mom about this. Please, just forget about it.  It doesen't mean I'm a bad person.  From Nana.
