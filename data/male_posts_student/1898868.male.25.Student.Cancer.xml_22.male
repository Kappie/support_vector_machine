The the new guy's cell phone goes off during class, and instead of some really cool ring tone, it's a really nerdy one.  Everyone quiets and looks at him.  "Oh... sorry," he says in a really cool voice, and casually turns off the phone.  In the meantime, there are girls (maybe Sarah Kelley) who are writing things in their notebooks like "Sarah (hearts) New Guy" and "Me + New Guy."  Maybe Sarah is even writing "Mrs. Sarah New Guy."  ----------------------------------------------  Unrelated: Later in class the professor uses a weird expression like "You need to make sure you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater" when talking about a principle.  There are a few sarcastic glances between students who think the professor is a nerd or whatever, and then the camera focuses on one student taking notes, who is trying to follow the lecture and is intently writing nothing that really has to do with the lecture, but gets "don't throw baby out with bathwater" down.
