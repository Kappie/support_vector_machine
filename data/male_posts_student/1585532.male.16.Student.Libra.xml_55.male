Weeee.  Anyways, nothing going on as of this moment...yet.  Everythings all boring and not fun.  Hopefully tomorrow proves more interesting.  I went to Disneyland the other day, and I will never go on a Friday again.  Though it was fun.  I went on Pirates about 6 or 7 times.  AND...Big Thunder Mountain Derailroad.  It's actually kinda fun.  They've slowed it down a bit thanks to the braking and such, and they removed one set of the wheel assemblies.  But yeah...nothing to report...  So...bye.  PS  You all will eventually see my Arizona photos...I'm in the process of loading them up...should be up any time now!
