She seems to hate me and I guess I deserve it then, because after all, she cannot really hate anybody and I manage to be the only person in the entire world that she hates. I posted a comment to one of her blogs, she'll probably just delete it, though I didn't really say anything much other than about a product that she talked about... O well... My night sucked again, instead of having any good dreams they were all crappy and consisted of Her being mad at me.. I have a feeling these dreams are going to be going on for a long time. I checked this morning too, to see if she even had me on her messanger lists.. Nope, MSN says I'm not on her list and I'm guessing the same for Yahoo.   Anybody feel like reading what emails when sent back and forth last night after she said she hated me? Ah.. well here they are: [note, Her name is changed to Her or to [name] because even if she hates me, I still care about her and am not going to try and ruin her life.]   Brian -> Her  If you will... please... talk to me.. I really don't want this to happen... I don't know what I can say if anything that will get you to stop hating me, but I want to try, I do, even if it means starting from nothing... Please [name].... talk to me...   Her -> Brian  No. I had to stop friendships in this situation before. You obviously won't give up, so I have to give up on you. No, I'm sick of being torn in half over this. I'm sick of being forced to regret falling in love. Yes, that's how you made me feel. You made me regret falling in love with Ama. I won't take it anymore. No, move on with your life already. You're getting pitiful. You knewI wasn't feeling well today anyway, and you still kept on with being annoying. Screw it, and screw you. Good riddance.   Brian -> Her  ...Good to know that you can just forget me like that I guess... I should of known that it didn't matter as much to you when you said you already loved somebody.. I know I pushed it and I guess I'm paying for it... but I'm not going to forget you... even if you decide to just forget me... I doubt you care, and probably blocked me now.. but at least I'll know that I care for you enough to try and work with things and try to at least be friends...   Brian -> Her [sent from a different email address]  I don't want to give up that easy on you [name].. I want to talk toyou.. I want to at least get a real goodbye from you please... You...you... you probably are just going to block me here too... but I'm hoping you won't... I'd do anything to get you to talk to me...anything, Please [name]... please     Those are the last words that she said to me and that I said to her.. I doubt I'll see her in vRO even any more... Today has started out shyty already and I doubt it will be getting any better unless things change between Her and I.   ~ Falcion ~ Rithem ~ O'Brien Bashir ~  ~~ Brian H.
