It was the best car purchasing experience ever!  No pushy salesman, no haggling, no B.S. period.  We checked in, signed the docs, inspected the vehicle, got the basic orientation and drove off the lot - all this in under 40 minutes.  Unbelievable.  What the Filipino Mafia can do for you!  Just kidding.  Although we did have Filipino connections working on this deal.    I'm currently on vacation until next week.  I told Norm to drive the new car to work tomorrow, since his coworkers wanted to see it.  His reply "Heck no! I'm not driving that mother-of-pearl coloured car."  So I guess that makes me the primary driver.  :)
