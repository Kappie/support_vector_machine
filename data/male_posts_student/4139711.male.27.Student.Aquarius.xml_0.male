Wondering why even the church looks the same far too often as the world?  Think about those who will not draw breath tonight.  Think about the unborn who are having their brains ripped out of their bodies while still in their mothers womb.  Think about the homeless man getting rained on.  And about the 15 year old girl who is being raped.  Sill sad? Depressed? Angry?  Think for a moment of the hatred of Jesus.  See how irrational it is?  Think about how society rages against the church. Isnt all we want to do is love them? We have a corrupt and immoral society.  A society that is in its death throes.  It is kicking and screaming trying to hold onto life, and ironically it is raging against the only being that can give it life.  So many christians lament and do nothing.  Many others burn out and desert the cause.  What are we to do? Perhaps its time once again to agressively engage our culture.  If we have been commanded to disciple and baptize nations.  Then how can we ignore culture and society.  We have been given a mandate, a christian manifesto so to speak to take dominion.  We are like like the Israelites, the promise that where ever our feet will step He has given us.  Was Christ a liar when He cried out "It is finished"?  Was salvation accomplished for His people.  Is the arm of the Lord too short to save now?  Can He take Canada and America and change it in a day?. Christ is not a liar. Let God be true and everyman a liar.  Mission/evangelism exists because true worship dosent.  Kiss Him, worship Him, and adore Him like you've never done it before.  Just see how the world changes when the church worships Him in Spirit and truth. Psalm 2The Reign of the LORD's Anointed1Why do the nations rage[ urlLink 1 ]    and the peoples plot in vain?2The kings of the earth set themselves,   and the rulers take counsel together,   against the LORD and against his anointed, saying,3"Let us burst their bonds apart   and cast away their cords from us."4He who sits in the heavens laughs;   the Lord holds them in derision.5Then he will speak to them in his wrath,   and terrify them in his fury, saying,6"As for me, I have set my King   on Zion, my holy hill."7I will tell of the decree:The LORD said to me, "You are my Son;   today I have begotten you.8Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage,   and the ends of the earth your possession.9You shall break[ urlLink 2 ] them with a rod of iron   and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."10Now therefore, O kings, be wise;   be warned, O rulers of the earth.11Serve the LORD with fear,   and rejoice with trembling.12Kiss the Son,   lest he be angry, and you perish in the way,   for his wrath is quickly kindled.Blessed are all who take refuge in him. Take refuge in Him beloved......  Footnotes   Or nations noisily assemble   Revocalization yields (compare Septuagint) You shall rule
