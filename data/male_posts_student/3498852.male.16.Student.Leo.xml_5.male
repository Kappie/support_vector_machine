That's so great. haha    Drumline practices start on wednesday... It's gonna be awesome.    So graduation was today...  that was the most boring thing I've ever experienced... but the party was well worth it.  Helium is a very good thing to have when you get bored....  I still want to hear my voice though... lol     Well I'm free for the summer basically...  still working on getting a job... and I better find one soon.  I'm getting tired of this POS computer of mine. haha  Well it's midnight.. so I'm gonna finish up on the computer and hit the sack... long day of band practice and nothingness tomorrow.  Sweet freedom.  :-P  "Wake Up" - Three Days Grace
