One year ago I was a young man, confused, and searching for ways to take my worthless time and turn it into enjoyment for others. That's when I found the program Blogger. Well, actually, my brother helped me with it and soon enough I was writing about my day-to-day life. Now that it's been a year, things have changed! I've become an adult, more understanding of the world, and a good reason to be on the computer for a good while each day! I know this sounds real cheesy, but it sounds good, ha-ha!    As an extra, I'm going to write about the celebration I had! I'll try to have it up A.S.A.P.!   Now, I have to give my thanks. I'd like to thank Max Gerry for starting my blog and helping me create a whole new revolution with my writing. And well, um, I guess that's it. WAIT, of course, I must thank all of you, the fans, for going on my website. Without you all, I wouldn't be at ALL motivated to keep this site running, and for that, I thank you. I hope that as time goes on, you will still visit and enjoy my site as much as I like running it!  Thanks to all, and have a good night!
