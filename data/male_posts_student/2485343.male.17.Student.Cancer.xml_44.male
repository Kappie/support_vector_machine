Chris Carrabba is my hero, Johnny Cash, Elvis. i reflect on this past week and i see nothing, literally. someone once told me, 'if you look back on your week and see nothing, there is something wrong with the way you conducted yourself that week.' i need to challenge myself. baseball is coming up, maybe that will help me in my school work, or lack there of. i am sort of happy for my brother. he lives baseball. im also proud of him for getting his ticket out, as he told me in 7th grade. im going to miss him. he has been such an influence in my life. maybe someday i can tell him how proud i am of him. he has his pick of colleges. heroes: Saul Williams, Jessie Lacey, Chris Carrabba, Johnny Cash, Elvis, Phillip Silva.
