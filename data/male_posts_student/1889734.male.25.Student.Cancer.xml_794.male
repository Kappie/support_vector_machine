Excerpt -  The commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks has received new information indicating that a senior officer in an elite unit of the security services of deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein may have been a member of al-Qaida involved in the planning of the suicide hijackings, panel members said Sunday.   News will continue to come out, and I think the case of the Left will continue to decay as we approach the election.  Unfortunately, the media will continue to grind away with their slant.  Here's an excerpt from  urlLink Boortz  this morning.  Excerpt -  The 9/11 Commission found there was a connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda.  Maybe not actual collaboration, but there was a connection.  Now ... read the headlines:  "Saddam, al-Qaeda Not Linked.  Sept. 11 Panel's Conclusion at Odds with Administration."  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.   "9/11 Panel Debunks Saddam Link.  Report:  No Evidence of al-Qaeda Ties."  Pittsburgh Tribune-Review  Now listen to the words of Keith Olberman of MSNBC last Wednesday.  "Memo to vice president:  9/11 Commission finds 'no credible evidence' of any link between al-Qaeda and Iraq."  You've already seen the stories ran by The Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN, Associated Press and more, all saying the same thing; all saying that the panel had found no link between Iraq and al Qaeda.  Now ... what does the Vice Chairman of the Panel say? Lee Hamilton says "There were connections between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's government.  We don't disagree with that.  What we have said is that we don't have any evidence of a cooperative or a collaborative relationship between Saddam Hussein's government and these al-Qaeda operatives with regard to attacks on the United States."   So the media is blasting Bush for something he didn't say, contorting his words of a connection between Iraq and AQ as a statement that Iraq had a leading role in 9/11.  Who knows, before this is all over, we might just find out that there was some connection, but for the moment, the US Administration hasn't made any such statement.  When will the media do their job?
