Also excited about Green Day, man..where have they been?  I hope this Volume is better than the last was music wise, there were a couple songs I liked on it but the rest kinda stunk, but this also comes with features such as:  videos from bands like Alkaline Trio and NOFX  Comedy pieces from Will Ferrell and others  and six informative political shorts.  Sounds nice, plus it is gonna be not too much money, I think its either 6 or 10 dollars like before...  Speaking of the  Lawrence Arms  they are coming to the shelter on the 2nd.  Brendan says  "we are leaving on our final tour in support of the Greatest Story Ever Told on Friday. After this, kids, it's gonna be a long time before we come around. So please, if you have any desire at all to see us, please come out, and we will rock it. For real."   Coming along with them on the tour are  urlLink  Music For America     to try to get people to vote for Kerry, or at least just vote.  Thats all for now.
