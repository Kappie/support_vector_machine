Well i can see the D but the A is not complete... hmph Maybe i should engrave Daniel's name on my arm...heheh I donno if Daniel will like it or not. Well during english class i felt like fainting because i did loose quiet a sum of blood. When i stood up to great Mr Bouncy Bruce... my head felt like no blood was going up there, my fingers felt as if there is no blood in there and my legs felt weak. Well during recess i pitied my friend, Syakilla, as her Cousin had just past away yesterday, May you rest in peace my dear brother.During band had a bad time but did have a little fun duringbreak time. Had to shout here and there coz the band was too noisy. On the way back home with my juniors, i sang the national day song, HOME. So went home and rest for a while. Well what a typical day for me today. Well till here bubbye.
