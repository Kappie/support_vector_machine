Some philosophical background is needed to understand the jokes, so I recommend not spending too much time on an entry if you donâ€™t get it.  Here are some hilarious examples.     alvinize , v. To stimulate protracted discussion by making a bizarre claim. "His contention that natural evil is due to Satanic agency alvinized his listeners."    buber , v. To struggle in a morass of one's own making. "After I defined the self as a relation that relates to itself relatingly, I bubered around for three pages." Hence buber, n. one who bubers. "When my mistake was pointed out to me, I felt like a complete buber."   derrida . From a old French nonsense refrain: "Hey nonny derrida, nonny nonny derrida falala."   gadam , v. To expound the meaning of abstruse writings, dreams, arcane and necromantic symbols, and the rest of the universe, in ways pleasing to the humanist. Hence, gadamer, n. one who gadams. Hence, also the adjective, gadam, gadamer, gademest, of or pertaining to the activity of gadaming. "I done my gadamest."   heidegger , n. A ponderous device for boring through thick layers of substance. "It's buried so deep we'll have to use a heidegger."   kripkography , n. The opposite of cryptography: the art of translating a meaningless message (about, e.g., de re necessity) into expressions that an uninitiated observer would take to be straightforwardly meaningful (e.g., "Look, it's not so hard. All he's saying is that since the term is a rigid designator, it refers to the same thing in all possible worlds"). "He used to claim he just 'couldn't understand' essentialism, but now, thanks to kripkography, he just sits there nodding and smiling."    kuhn , n. A fox often mistaken for a hedgehog; it is usually attended by such a commotion that it appears more than twice as heavy as it really is.    mctaggart , n. A black hole which not only sheds no light but in which time stands still. "Some mctaggarts are rather broad."   moore , v. To try to win an argument by taking something out of your pocket. "I couldn't think of anything to say so I hauled off and moored him."   rort , n. m. (1) an incorrigible report; hence, rorty, adj. incorrigible. n. (2) Fashionable but confused discourse. "Don't talk rort."   taylor , v. (in the idiom, to taylor the argument) To defend an absurd position or conclusion by inventing equally absurd premises or inferences; as in. "It's easy to get a proof of fatalism if you know how to taylor the argument." Also, taylor's dummy, an absurd principle on which to hang bits of metaphysical nonsense. My hope is that someday I will make an important contribution to philosophy and be immortalized by a silly pun in the philosophical lexicon.  I would encourage readers to come up with their own creative entries and post them in the comments.
