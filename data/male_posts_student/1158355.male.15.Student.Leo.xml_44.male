We went all the way to Lindenhurst again to get Alison's new lamp at the Bedroom Source which is where I recently bought my room's new furniture (the first day of vacation). Again, we passed our old house which is beautiful compared to most of the other houses. It was like driving through memory lane, so many memories, everything I recognized. We went to All American Burgers and Franks in Massepequa. This has been my dad's and my favorite burger place. It took us 30 minutes to get the food because it's so crowded. After the food, I went to GameStop and bought the Zelda:Wind Waker Player's Guide. I beat the game but now I need to get all the extra shit. After that all, I went to Sports Plus with Keith and Steve hoping I'd see The Used. I also had some left over tokens from the last time I went with Dave (gangster encounter) so I decided, might as well use them. Some 10 year olds liked me and they were following me around, it was freaky. We met 3 cool girls, Ashley, Valerie (Beth!), and Sammy. I managed to see The Used from the back entrance. They were awesome, they were going all out crazy. I gotta go to one of those concerts one day so I can unleash some craziness (the real Tom). Ok, so after everything, I came home, drank a huge can of Arizona, fought with a wanksta from GH and scared him shitless, wrote my blog, played Zelda and went sleepy.
