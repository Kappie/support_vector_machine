Thats where all the rubbish started  Before I say anything.. I just tell you guys something.. When you pierce a nail through a piece of wood, and remove it, there will be a hole which you will never be able to remove.. Thus it is that same as impression.. good or bad.. Particularly bad ones though.. It will be left on you and you'll not forget... Secondly, chinese say that the bad things will spread of a thousand miles.. Thus whatever wrong you do will be remembered for life..  Lemme go into my main topic.. As most of you from pyss-spf band will know.. I have done a great wrong to Mr Poh.. detailed one too long lahz.. Anyway..At the prata place in clarke quay.. I had no money so i didnt not order any food.. All was fine.. everyone started to tuck into their food.. They had not have dinner.. All were eating like pigs.. :D..Well.. Then the huy suddenly came with a roti john.. no one ordered that.. And now i've let one of the seven deadly sins "greed" got the better of me.. Forbbiden fruit taste best.. Thus i ate the roti john.. anyway daniel told me we could cheat thru them and get away with it.. Pls take note i am NOT blaming for my misdeeds.. Therefore i ate it.. Though i taste best..   Then came the bill.. When the time came for the accounting of the 2 roti john(jun xiang ordered one as well) I claimed that we did not order the roti john.. Den as you know they keep claiming that we did(in actual fact we didn't, but i ate it anyway) Then Kenrick step in.. We eventually told him there was but we did not order but we ate it.. So he left and apparently he went to pay for us the cost of the roti john.. Thus this is all my fault lah.. This will add to the list of my greatest mistake in my entire life..  1) Took cigarettes and burn it for fun when i was in pri 4 with Lionel(My pri sch best buddy) Note:I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE A PUFF OF THE CIGARETTE) Got caught and punished badly by the principal 2) Stole Dad's money for the things i wanted(Greed got the better of me again) 3) Fought with my closest cousin.. Now he and i, though on talking terms, are not as chatty as before 4) Lied to Kenrick on 23-5-2004 5) Attempted to cheat at prata shop at clarke quay on 4-6-2004   When can i set things right? What is wrong with me??? I could hav borrowed money from someone there to pay? Why do i have to lie?? Why!!? What IS WRONG? IS IT MY STUDIES? MY MUSICIANSHIP? MY LIFE? MY CIRCLE OF FRIENDS? KENRICK? OR IS IT JUST IN ME TO LIE.. I really don't know.. Maybe I lost the very friend who brought my interest back into band music already.. The very friend who i had spent one of the happier times with.. The closest friend in this short time i knew him.. Gone.. Is this how life should be? And why can't i find the courage to tell him i am sorry for the things that i've done?? WHY!? ARGH.. It's killing me.. Even people find it hard to swallow the fact that he and i are not like before.. Thanks for your concern Siew Li, Lisa and Benedict.. But this i think will have to go on for quite some time.. I hope not though.. When i have mustered enough guts and courage to talk to him or when he finally forgive me, thats when it will stop.. But wil things be the same as before? I have no idea.. The sky is gloomy.. I need a bridge over troubled waters.. yet who is able to provide me that? Benedict? Ruoting? Lisa  Co? I really dont.. Perhaps the bridge is Kenrick himself.. For now i will stay the same as i was today.. Trust is perhaps something that you have to give but yet you can't.. Sad.. The last time someone did the same to him he took 4 mths to foegive them.. For me?  I really don't know... Longer? Shorter? Seems like the former is the more probable one.. For now i just have to live with the feeling of guilt, the feeling of being a liar, the feeling of sadness, the feeling of being left out, the feeling of suddenly thinking of means of saying sorry to him, the feeling of being lost, the feeling of lonliness, the feeling of letting people down..   What will he think of me now? A liar? A loser? A sinner? A jian huo? A person who cannot be trust? I think is all of them being added up, forming a phrase called Felix Yap Kaiming.. Thats me..  In his dictionary, Yap Kaiming Felix probably means: A person who lies with his eyes open, loser, and a person who cannot be trusted(Noun)..   Anyway, i thanks siew li, lisa, and benedict for their concern again.. ya.. to farzana.. i dunno if you're feeling sown these days because of this matter.. I wanna tell you i DUN BLAME you for what has happened ok? so cheer up lah.. It really makes me feel bad you noe.. So if she doesn't sees this.. Convey this message to her ah.. Thanks people.. =p  Well having said enough.. i tink he probably will not read my blog anyway.. I see you soon.. one last thing.. Members of PYSS-SPF Band.. put in all your effort for this very last month.. I am sure you will not want people tosaid that we are a tyco-gold banmd rite?? SO WORK HARD AND PROVE THEM WRONG.. SO TK BOWEN DEYI BUKIT PANJANG AND THE WHOLE OF SINGAPORE TAHT WE'RE THE BEST!!!! Chao pple..
