Oh well, I'll think of something.  Oh my gosh I just thought of something.  What if some weird creep finds this and steals my identity?  All kinds of people are on the internet.  Anyway, if that happens, I'm taking yours.  Your identity, I mean.  It's only fair, since you caused me to lose mine.  I'll be Marten Dollinger, and you can be some weird internet creep.  That'll teach you to reveal my secrets online.  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
