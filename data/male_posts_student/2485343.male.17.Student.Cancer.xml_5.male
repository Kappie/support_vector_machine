I wish I could just not give a damn, and follow through with my courses of action. But I just can't. Well...there is still an opportunity. I mean the thing is... I don't need anyone in my life right now. Sure it's fucking nice to be able to like have relationships with people...But the problems with that is the fact that there is a lack of resources. Not a lack of people per se, but a lack of the kinds of people I would like to spend my time with. I refuse to go through social hoops to get to know someone, along with that I refuse to be forced to do that. So that is the main reason why I am here by myself still. I don't understand a lot of people's reasons for doing things. In fact, I don't see where some people get off doing the things they do to me.
