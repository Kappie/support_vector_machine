You can see his gorgous mug  urlLink here . Ain't he cute?  Cuthbert lives in  urlLink CuthbertLand . In it you can see his plastic tree, which Cuthbert decided was evil and killed and conquered. I later propped it up again. You can also see the pretty shell I bought for him that he will hopefully change into when he feels like it, and his orange starfish-shaped sponge that he uses to get his water. His food dish is also visible in the back by the shell. Sadly Cuthbert and his accessories are too big for CuthbertLand, so he will be moving into a bigger cage soon. Name still unknown, but CuthbertWorld is a definite possibility.  Cuthbert is the best pet ever. He's silly and hyper, cute and clean, and friendly yet with pinchers to ward off evil young sisters. Cuthbert is a true champion of justice. He also shows an incredibly well-developed interest in  urlLink pop culture , considering his relatively young age.
