Oi.....starting with a friggin phone call at 7am and lasting until 1130pm+...yeah I'm runnin' on overdrive as we speak. But it has been a fun day....sorta....but the night was insanely long. So right now pretty tired...but I will still push forth and complete this post =P.  My day started off somewhat retarded this morning. I normally sleep to 730...but was awoken by a phone call at 7am? Who would call at such an outrageous time I thought only Patrick could calling in saying he couldn't go to school or something....but no it wasn't. Nor was it a relative from HK or sometin. It was Robert Michelak asking to borrow DDR. Did I let him borrow it? Uhh.....wake ME up at 730am....I THINK NOT. So therefore....he never got DDR from me =P. Well now that I've been awaken from my slumber....I reluctantly....and angrily got out of bed....stomping down the stairs....and nearly falling out of my chair when sitting down to eat. Yeah my balance is VERY poor at 7am. So ate breakfast, did usual morning routine *earlier than usual* and then tried to kill sometime...played the piano mostly....and then headed out to school at around 745am or so. Yeah my steam wasn't totally blown away yet...and I was still pretty peeved in the car. Yeah...waking me up from my sleep is one of the very few things that I can't tolerate...besides hypocrites, bling bling gangstas, and people that put the definition of "cocky" to a whole new level. See? VERY few things =P.  I got to school 'bout 805ish and pretty much headed straight to history. Chatted with Ryan and Milosz a bit, and then up I went to history class....where today we would head to the library to do research....  As said....we went and did research. What I'm doing for the research: Canadian economy in the 90's. Bottom line: It was mediocre. With many ups and downs, and gas prices that are more ridiculous than tye dye t-shirts. Also our dollar has sucked over the last 10 years. Wonder what happened to make it plummet from 95 cents to 67....and then back up to 74. So researched for 75 minutes on our economy....and that was pretty much it. Me and Hailey couldn't really figure out this one person's name in our group. Yeah I know kinda sad....but it happens I guess *shrug.*  Civics: we started debates today. Hmm....so difficult to come up with pros for an issue you are always against *i.e. Same Sex Marriage* Unfortunately I had to support this issue being the "government," BUT IT'S SO HARD. Lol but nothing was as bad as Quinn....he was on the government side and said a statement supporting opposition lol. Debates were kinda fun though....I made a remark, but it was a crappy one. Got rebutted pretty effectively *shudder.* For abortion though, I was whooping some ass =P. Being against abortion is easy...as one big point always is that you are murdering a child....though it is unborn but it still does have life. Anywho....since it's an assembly day... classes were shortened, so by 1025 we were out and down in the auditorium for the student council elections....er more of speeches to make you vote for him/her.  Assembly was kinda boring....wansn't as good as last year's but I'm not surprised since each candidate had a $50 limit on campaigning. Apparently last year the president spent over $300 on his campaign....and I'm not surprised he got elected =P. Today though I liked some of the speeches that were put out. Though I sorta knew who I was voting for in the beginning, but it was still pretty cool seeing the different personalities of each person going up and saying what they had to say. President, Treasurer, and Vice was pretty much default...with the people that won it giving acceptance speeches instead of "voting for them" speeches. Oh yeah....and of course I can't forget the trailer for Phrinj Movie night. "Nitrogen is a common earth element" is the movie they showed, which is a spin-off of a 007 film. That got my attention though...so I'm definitely going to go see movie night next monday =P. So after that short assembly, headed back to class to vote. And this is who I voted for (don't shoot me please):  Minister of Communications: Tehmina  The two social directors or w/e: Melissa and Teefy  Yup....that pretty much sums up my morning....preetty boring I know...but at least tomorrow....my morning will be at the Social Justice Now conference...WHOO NO SCHOOL =p.  Lunch headed out to Jasper's today. Mmm....Chicken quesadilla and caesar salad. All for the somewhat expensive price of $6.50 (includin' a root beer.) Ate, talked about random crap....hmm can't remember much else...for some reason today everyone noticed I got new glasses...Got a haircut yesterday maybe that did sometin =S. Anywho point is ate lunch and left and talked also (not in any particular order.) Oh yeah....JASPER'S HAS ICED CAPPUCHINOS! I just found that out today =P.  Math class....finished cosine law....and really there's only about 4 more classes of math before review *sweet!* So did questions, chatted for a bit....and then programming class came along.  Programming: ALMOST DONE MY 007 ANIMATION! Only a few more lines of programming....and I should be done =P. Right now it's pretty good....I like it anyways lol. So almost done that...and today we also did some spreadsheet stuff. Final evaluation...NO EXAM! SHWEET!  FINALLY school's over. Bused home w/ Ryan and Dominik, and then got home around....330 ish? Anyways point is....got home, ate, went on compy for a bit then slept until 6pm where then I had to get up for music night...  *few hours later*  Yup, after a stomach-upsetting dinner, and a lift where I was drinkin' some tea to wake me up....SENIOR MUSIC NIGHT. Ugh I played horrifically tonight, but point is the band still sounded good...along with the other ensembles =). 4 hours of pure senior music. I didn't mind it...in fact I enjoyed much of it. Though I had a bit of an upset stomach, but after a word of prayer....and just complaining in my head....it wasn't much of a bother after a while. Jazz band was amazing like usual....but the best part of tonight HAD to be the song that goes with the movie "Nitrogen is a Common Earth Element." LOL it was EXACTLY like an actual 007 movie theme song....and was written by none other...than the infamous Dave Rutt =P. Lol hilarious song though....you know a song's gonna be a hit single when it's a song about Nitrogen. Hysterical though....and then after that we went on with the rest of our program. Choir *shudder* and some other ensembles....and to close it off was us...the senior band. Ugh stupid cell phone....I accidentally left it on vibrate during intermission....well I think I did I doubt Maisie even could figure out how....and was so annoying throughout performance when my parents for some reason called me 10 times. If I don't answer it the first time....I WON'T ANSWER IT THE 10TH TIME! It's like charades....  "IF THE ANSWER'S NOT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME DAMNIT IT'S NOT RIGHT THE 2ND OR 3RD TIME!"         -Stewie Griffin  Yes a family guy quote....but I really agree with it lol. Well eventually the night did end....with the senior band *the one I'm in* ending off the night with "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night," "Godzilla attacks Las Vegas," and "Vesuvius." Great pieces, and if you wanna hear us play Vesuvius....go to the "Stars of the Festival" concert on May 26th @ Centennial Hall. Out of 20 performances, 11 are from Central =).  Anyways....Mophead gave me a lift back home....and here I am now, an hour later @ 1225am....technically Friday Morning posting up this blog. Chatted with Jenn, Peggy, Vikki and some other TCers and people on MSN for a bit...and now I say "Au Revoir."  Au Revoir.
