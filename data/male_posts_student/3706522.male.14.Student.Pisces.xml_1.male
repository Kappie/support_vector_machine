Since this is a blog (see above), I'll be on here much more often and longer than the forum. Plus, summer will give me a lot of extra time on my hands to do stuff with.  3. If 'Little Princess' annoys anyone (especially me, excluding himself), I can and will ban him.  4. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be misquoted and used against you in court. (OK I admit that had nothing to do with anything)   WS
