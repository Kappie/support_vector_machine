What we did do was pick up our lawn tractor.  After getting it last night, Dad left it at my grandma's house (he was going to a speedway in the same town and didn't feel like taking the trailer all the way home, then driving all the way back).  Dad and I drove to Grandma's to pick up the trailer and tractor.      We got there and she had lunch ready for us.  We had meatloaf, green beans, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, cole slaw, tomatoes, and bread.  Your classic "lunch made with Grandma's love".  It was great.  Afterward, she wanted me to help her with her computer.  You know, those new-fangled counting machines.  She has a photo editing program and hasn't the slightest clue how to operate it.  I took my time and explained everything to her, which took about 45 minutes.  It didn't help that she lacks the steady hand required to double-click.      Now, on to the mower.  It's a Murray (Performance division) with a 17.5 hp OHV engine in champion red.  It's considerably smaller than our old Murray, with a 42" blade span, instead of a 46".  However, it is more nimble and has a much smaller turning radius.  Plus, you can't go wrong with independant front suspension.  Not a bad mower at all, if you ask me.      Dad and I called about a white 1997 Ford Thunderbird LX.  I liked it pretty well, except for the 3.8L V6.  It only produces 145hp, and with a car that heavy, you need a V8 to feel the acceleration.  I'm going to pass it up.  I am getting a little desperate, though.  I'll take either a Dodge Avenger or a Chrysler Sebring now, or anything that comes along and I like well enough.  I don't want to have to ride the bus to school anymore, but have 2 weeks to find a car.  Wish me luck, because I'm going to need it.      Thanks for reading.  Ya'll come back now, ya hear? ...what the hell am I saying...
