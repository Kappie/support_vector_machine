I'll post how it was then. And then I'm off again, to help out at a summer camp for younger boys, grades 3rd through 6th or something like that. I was in the group that's going when I was that age, so it might be nice to go.  Well, I wrote a new song today, although I'm not sure its as good as "Forgive Us", but I kind of like it. Basically, its just about people (especially those in authority) who try to put us in some sort of conformity box, to try and make us be what THEY want us to be. Its a nice little ditty, with a pretty keyboard part to go with it...OK we all know I'm joking there, but what the heck. Its not my fault keyboards are boring. OK, maybe they're not boring, but most songs that feature them are just not my style...I'm just gonna post the song and shut-up already.   The Box  I can smell the concrete and hear the mixing in your head Thinking of what's to come, I wish I was dead I strike out at the plywood stands, but I'm beat back You pretend to give me everything I lack When, in truth, I can get those things myself, alone I see your blind conviction and it chills me to the bone Stop it now, before we're both locked in our pain Can't you see there's nothing to gain?  (Chorus) You'll never keep me in a box Build it for yourself You'll never keep me in a box I don't want to match you You'll never keep me in a box Don't put me on the shelf  What am I to do now that the bricks are stacking up? I should not, will not, cannot, shut-up! A hammer to the structure only does so much I'm crippled, without a crutch Blackness is closing in as the ceiling is built I can feel my spirit begin to wilt My box, my home, is a dark place now But still, I will never bow!  (Chorus)  My scream lets out and the concrete begins to splinter I'm in for a very frigid winter I push my bleeding hand through the hole I've made And the walls begin to crumble and fade I'm in for so much more, I can see But in the box I'll never be! So the choice is now yours to make Do you want to live a real life, or continue this fake?  (Chorus)   Well, while you stew on that and come up with all the reasons it suck/rocks to then put in a comment *hint hint*, I'll ramble some more. I wasn't joking in the title, most of this post is just random stuff that comes up as I think of it.  Well, the Algebra class is over. I escaped with a B, which made me happy. I could take the final and try to get an A, but I'd have to get a 96 or better to do it...not gonna happen. It was kind of depressing today, because we were only supposed to go if we wanted to get the review for the final and only 8 people showed up from a class of about 20. And tomorrow, only about 5 will be there, because the rest of us are happy with our grades and are exempt from the test because we came to class!  David and I have been working hard on the freeform RPG we're working on, and its coming along nicely. I was a little disappointed in the logo he drew up for it, but the lettering he did was nice and I'm going to use it in the site. The game will be on the server at www.mysteryandmagic.com. I'd suggest to ANYONE who likes RPing to check out that site and look at the different games: they're all FREE!!! If you want more information from someone who plays one some of them, or anything like that, leave me a comment and I'll email you. *Another hint about leaving comments...*  I'm not the only one writing up a storm of songs, Warlock has come up with some too. I won't post those though, since I didn't write them and they're not my material. It wouldn't be cool.  Well, I recently visited the city library and happened across one of my favorite books: Flowers for Algernon. Its amazing, I've got a really good memory for books and I knew EXACTLY what would happen in the book, and yet I couldn't stop myself from getting it and reading it for what I think is the 4th time for me to read it. If you haven't read the full novel version, I would suggest you check it out. It honestly makes you think. Its the story of a retarded man who's given a surgery to increase his IQ to such a level that he becomes a genius and then...well...I think I'll leave it at that before I reveal too much. This is one of the only books I've ever read that I actually felt emotional while I read and I'll admit that the first time I read it, a few years ago, I almost cried. Its a VERY sad story, quite a tear jerker but not in some sappy stupid way. Beautifully done.  Painting sucks. Beautiful recently decided to paint her room and all the furniture in it and I, of course, offered to help. She'd already started when I got there, so I helped her paint some of the walls, and then I had to leave. The next day, the walls were basically done except for one, and we moved on to furniture because we couldn't get to the wall effectively without getting some furniture out of there. So, we did that, and finally I had to go AGAIN! So, the THIRD DAY, we finished...FINALLY! Of course, Beautiful did most of it because she had to be there constantly, so she got to have more 'fun' than me. Truly, it was a lot of fun, because we got to hang out and talk a lot while we painted. That's probably why it took so long. Either way, it would have been a lot worse had we not done it together, but since we did it together, it was fun.
