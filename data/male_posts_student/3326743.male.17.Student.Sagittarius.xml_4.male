Pray for me.  I've done some things I shouldn't have and I'm struggling some.  It's so hard to have devotions even though I know I should.  Pray that I'll have a desire.  I need it.  I'm looking forward to the Bible study.  It was depressing at first on Friday when things didn't work out, but Mondays will work now.  Read through first Timothy.  It'll help for the Bible study.  See ya.  PRAY.
