Most of it got pushed back to this month so I'm expecting it to pick up anytime soon.  Still feeling very drained. Not sure why. Could be the office politics going around of late. It totally changes the working environment. Especially when you're caught in the middle.  Then again, it could be my seemingly lack of time management. Plan to sleep early, but always end up having to do one thing or other.  While we are on that topic, it could also be due to my comp giving me loads of problems. Corrupted files and lost chains and links. All due to some beta level software I managed to score to help test out. Tried to anyway, it just ended up total messing up my harddrive. And I haven't made any backups recently. Had to do alot of "zombie" hours to fix things, but its hard to fix what you do not know is broken (hmm...did that come out right?). End up chasing alot of ghost in the machine  this leads to:   Windows 9x Tip/Tweak #1     [[Always make regular backups.At the very least copy your Windows/system directory onto floppy (or floppies) and keep them safe with your Windows Boot Disk. If you have a CD-RW, even better....grab a copy of Norton Ghost and make total complete backups of your harddisk.It my take up a CD per Gig, but if had a total failure on the disk....you will be thankful you used the time to make them. If you need more details or backup help, just drop me a line at my email below.]]     Me gotta get ready to feed the meat. Meeting Da Man for dinner. Need to pass him something.
