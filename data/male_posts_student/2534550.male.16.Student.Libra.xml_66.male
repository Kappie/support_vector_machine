The bus ride was really fun i slept alot but we also played a bunch of games watched alot of movies and found out some interesting things. We left at 3:30 and ate at about 8:00 or so Marc Havner ate a 16 by 16 from In  Out for those of u that dont know thats 16 patties and 16 pieces of cheese complete with two buns. He finished all minus 3 patties. We got to the hotel around 2:00 and we were out, we had a long day ahead of us... we rehearsed for 30 min. each choir and then we left for some shopping mall place, i dont know which one though. then went to downtown disney. It was really fun we had a good time in build a bear factory making a Mr. Teeters bear. The thing that happened next potentially ruined the trip for me though. A girl named Gina stole from Sephora and got caught. She was so dumb and i dont understand y she did this. But the security guard where following her around the store after they saw her put something in her bag on the security camera. So she was caught and was screaming on the floor and was just all bad. long story short the girl that was with her had to hang out with my mom for the rest of the trip. which was really supposed to be our time together. But this girl attracted a crowd and there were just so many of us so i didnt have any fun for like half a day until my mom was tired and went back to the hotel and kassie had to go with a different chaperone. but yea the whole rest of the time i just decided to leave but it still messed up my whole  trip because i didnt get to hang out with my friends at all. but it was ok because they day of the festival came and we were amazing. We one 1st place concert with a gold, first place chamber with a gold, sweepstakes for high school choir combined for chamber and concert, sweepstakes for higest music score combined for any school, and sweepstakes for best choir for chamber singers. I was in complete aww...ive never been so happy in my life. but yea i think im gonna go goin' to chill wit some choir folks tonight payce.
