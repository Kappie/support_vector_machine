For the first of my ten days, I was put in Postal so I could learn my way around.  All that I actually learnt is that nobody does any work in postal, because there is so little to do.  Oh, and the Postal coordinator or whatever his title is, while being quite a nice guy, is a total Brent.  He even has the same smile, same laugh, same mannerisms as well as the same personality.  Perhaps it is true that there is a Brent in every office.
