Adam and Ulli, thanks for letting me crash at your places.  Adam i don't know why we thought it would be a good idea to get another beer after the danceatoria, but it was a great time.  And Ulli, do you piss on the plaza in iceland?  But i'm gonna enjoy the absinthe that tim got in that random country without a government.  Hope to see ya soon.  later.  Conor
