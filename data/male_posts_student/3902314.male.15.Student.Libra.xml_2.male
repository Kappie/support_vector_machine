When feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone (Applegate), Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other "female" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons... it's war."  Interesting premise, yet there were many flaws in this movie which ruined the desired effect. As a fan of Will Ferell I agreed to see this movie with very high hopes. Sadly, I was thoroughly dissapointed with the entire production.  I believe that the main reason for my dislike was the supporting cast.  The jokes told by the cast members were either hit or miss.  Too many times during the film were there awkward silences in the theater after the various buffoonery. Average film.  Rated PG-13 for sexual humor, language and comic violence. Runtime: USA:91 min
