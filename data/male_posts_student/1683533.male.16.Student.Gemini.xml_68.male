Course, they arent that good now....so she says we are gonna have to talk, and maybe have some consequences...*sighs* great....  My dad screamed at me all the way home to my mom's...i forget why...  All my friend's aren't going to Pajamarama...so i think i am just not gonna go as well...  I need my counselor now....  "You're not the boss of me! I'm the boss of me!" -The Vandals
