It seems to me that the Democrats as a whole would be better to adopt a "vote for one of us" strategy, because the image of a half a dozen people on one side of the room arguing amungst themselves and then GWB on the other side of the room sitting quitly not what they want to project.  Basically what I am saying is: unite against a common enemy!  But then again, who better than the American people to decide, that's what Democracy  is .  Maybe I don't have any idea what I'm talking about. Maybe my inane rambling is completely off-the-mark. But I think I have some kind of correct perspective.  I'm not sure about this election (even more so because I'll miss being able to vote in it by 4 months).
