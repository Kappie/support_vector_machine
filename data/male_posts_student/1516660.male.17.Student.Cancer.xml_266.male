I bascially surfed around and chatted with XC lor. Yeah.                                                                         Mother cooked lunch at 12+. Instant noodles la, nothing much. Moo meow meow. I also downloaded Wendy's mp3s. Ayioh...so idiotic. I can only download like, 4? The rest are either unavilable, corrupt or the stupid people changed the file names. Darn those idiots!  HaHa. I can tell you I slept from 1 till about 2.50+. I just lie down on my bed and slept, waking up about like 15-30 mins in between. HaHa. I am such a lazy cat. I am so sleepy! *Yawn*  After that, I helped Janet burn a CD containing installation for Dreamweaver. HaHa. It cna't work though....hmmm. Then, I surfed the Net, play Neopets, this and that la.   I went to bath at 6, came out, ate dinner while watching my Sat shows. Then, tada, I am here. HaHa. I don't know what to say liao...  I think I stop here liao lor. Such a short (and boring? or sweet?) blog. Ha! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
