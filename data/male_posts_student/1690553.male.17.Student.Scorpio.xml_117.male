So tired so I won't write much.  BTW, here's some funny computer error messages in haiku form.  A crash reduces Your expensive computer To a simple stone  You step in the stream But the water has moved on the page is not here  First snow, then silence This thousand dollar screen dies So beautifully   From Reader's Digest
