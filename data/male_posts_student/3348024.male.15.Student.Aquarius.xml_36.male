Judge Mike Peters said, "She's going to get more than her horses got."   So that's how we base our punishment in this legal system... Well I'm thinkin Mr. J. Rapist is in for a surprise then... LMAO, I hope he "gets more than his horse."  If ya catch my drift... Well, it's a funny read either way...
