In fact, two hours of boys teasing the shit out of each other led to me laughing more than I have in a very very very long time.   Eminem will never act again. Or at least, if he's smart he won't - reason for this: He's going out on a high note. He played himself to a T, and I've got to say I enjoyed his performance very much. I doubt very much that this was acting - more of an immersion into a life he's already lived. He'll never top this - I'm sure the boy can't act, but fuck it was fun watching him for the time alloted.  So we essentially are presented with The Karate Kid IV. B Rabbit waxes on and waxes off through the flick, building to a neat climax that had me laughing for a good fifteen minutes. Mehki Phephiphephr is a stellar Mr. Miyagi, what with his dreads and very carefully groomed goatee.   I enjoyed the film. I liked watching Mr. Mathers III rip a strip off some cocky bastards. The cobra gang had nothing on them. If you get the chance, go see it.
