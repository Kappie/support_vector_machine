Note: of course, all those past blogs are not accurately dated so I guess you have to use your imagination.  I've chugged through most of my World History SAT II book with a trusty highlighter over this past weekend and now I only have 83 pages of review left to read through.  Once I'm done with that I'm gonna keep reading it over, taking notes, and reading it over some more until it sticks--all up until June 4th, the day before I take my test.    In other news, Mr. Austin urged me to join ARISTA, which is A. Philip Randolph's chapter of the National Students Honor Society.  I turned in my application today and he said I'd get the invitation to the ceremony soon.  Then I asked him if you had to have been accepted to the get that invitation and he said yes but that wasn't going to be a problem for me at all.  That made me feel good.  When I picked up my recommendation from my English teacher for ARISTA today she squeezed my forearm and smiled.  It was so nice of her, I don't know.  I guess I felt touched because I hated her so much at the beginning of the year but I've come to appreciate her and respect her greatly as of late.  Not to mention, that definitely meant she gave me an insane recommendation.  Class elections are on Wednesday I believe.  The first draft of my speech is finished but it needs some additions, and I need some more info to put into it.  I'm feeling confident.  Now I'm gonna head on down to the living room now and do some SAT review.  Godd I'm such a loser..
