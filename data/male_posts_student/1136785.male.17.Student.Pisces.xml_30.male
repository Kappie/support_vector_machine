I didn't really mind after I eventually found a spot on a bench so I could sit down and watch the show.  I need to get back to studying for a massive test I have in roughly nine hours and ten minutes. It will be the first time we will have to do arabic to english and vice versa translations - complete sentences at that.  But as I got some more studyin' coke from the machine, it gave me a quarter (fucking expensive Yale coke) as change. But this was no ordinary quarter. This was a  state  quarter. Arkansas, to be precise. This is the most fucked up lsd inspired currency I have seen - not counting all them foriegn "funny money". The back of the quarter is so crammed with random shit that I can barely fathom what the hell is going on. Front and center is a giant floating cut diamond. Beneath the diamond is a forest of what might be evergreen trees on the bank of a river. A godzilla sized duck is flying above the river to the right, while on the left is a massive weed stalk that appears to be some mixture of marijuana and wheat:     Now  urlLink they   have a logical and clear explantation for it; but to the uneducated masses that will use it everyday it appears Norman Rockwell and Andy Warhol collectively defecated on the mold in back of the US mint. You would think that a state with such image problems as Arkansas would take this as an oppurtunity for some good PR, like  urlLink Alabama.  They tell us to forget the gun totin' red necks and a legacy of bigotry well into the modern era by urging us to remember what's really important - Helen Keller and her amazing accomplishment; and how one woman's trials and tribulation and abilty to overcome despite the odds makes up for one state's shortcomings.  This coming from a guy from Kansas.  Shit I can't believe I wasted this much time on this. I need to study. Back to work.
