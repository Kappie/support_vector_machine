I'm kinda hungry, haven't eaten much all day besides a hamburger and have been writing essays for the better half of the day.  I walk downstairs and my little sister is watching TV while doing her homework, there is a rule at my house that says "no TV while doing homework." I polietly ask her to turn the television off; she refuses.  I turn it off and tell her she needs to concentrate on her homework.  She then yells at the top of her lungs, "BUT I HAVE TO WATCH THE OLYMPICS FOR SCHOOL!!!" Okay, she was watching cartoons on Disney, she didn't even know what channel the Olympics were on anyway. I tell her that she can sit at the table (she was on a chair/couch watching TV), do her homework, stop throwing all the candy wrapper from whence she was eating candy in the chair and that she can turn on the TV when she is supposed to watch the Olympics.  Here's where it gets crazy.  She gets up and screams.  Followed by tears, running around and complaints that I don't understand her.  After about 3 minutes of me talking to her screaming I get fed up and yell at her.  I say that while mom is at work I am left in charge and that she should know better than to disobey mom's rules when she is not home.  After I say that I move my sister's homework and books to the table where she can get to work.  Wow, does she hate this.  Once more she screams and declares that she hates me and wants to kick me in the balls.  I say "fine, go ahead, if you can."  She gets up off the floor and charges me.  When she gets close enough I sidestep and grab her from behind when she passes me.  She screams and I ask her to calm down.  Her breathing slows, she quiets down, things start to go in my favor.  THEN SHE DECIDES SHE WANTS TO BACK KICK ME IN THE NUTS. Great move sis.  When her foot moves I catch it inbetween my legs, just below my manhood.  Her ankle is trapped, that must have hurt.  Now I am seriously fed up with this little girl and her psycho problems.  I turn her around and lower my voice, calmly I tell her to get back to work and stop complaining.  When I let go of her she takes a few steps and slips on her socks, great she hit her head.  Don't worry, she was fine.  But she didn't think so.  Now I have a crazy girl running around complaining that my brother and I are yelling at her when we are barely speaking over a whisper.  God, I am so sick of her.  I call my mom, she tells me that she has ordered pizza for us and asks how everyone is doing, I explain the situation.  I get my sister to pick up another phone and mom tells her no TV is allowed while she does her homework, my sister says "okay" and everything is fine.  WTF??? So now I have a mom that thinks I did the right thing, but yelled at my sister too much, I yelled like once compaired to my sister's million yells.  A brother that thinks I'm a meanie head because I didn't want to look at some internet cartoon while I was writing this post and a sister that hates my guts and wants me dead.  Anyone else have problems like this?
