While a lot of the multiple choice questions are subjective, the essays make up for it.  If you write good strong essays and support your points, you should (hopefully!) do well.  I think people just find the test to be hard because its not something you can memorize out of a book; its skills for recognizing rhetorical strategies and writing well that count.
