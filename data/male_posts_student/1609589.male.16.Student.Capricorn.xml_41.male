I loved how at the end of the flight the entire mass of passengers and crew(led by me) collectively threw him out of the airplane. I thought that that was the start of pure acceptance between humans of all races. Or maybe I just dreamed that. God, that guy was an asshole.  I was readin on this website about these 2 people, on halloween, dressed up as Blue Man Group and went to parties and passed out twinkies. I think that would be cool to do. We should do it. I need 2 people. Preferrably people that have access to drumsticks and/or lengths of PVC pipe(optional). It'd be even cooler to have a girl in there, just to mix up the.... 'mix' a little bit. Like at one of Sarah's parties, which are cool already, could be souped up(I like that word... soup) some more with special guests who couldn't talk, and were just trying to figure out the world around them. I know BMG chose 3 blue men at a time because it gives both a feeling of community, and a feeling of isolation. I watched a video of 3 blue men walking around Boston. It was crazy. One of them stepped in gum, and they all watched in curious amusement as the one who stepped in it picked his foot up off the ground, with a trail of gum still stuck to the sidewalk. Then, as if the gum dissapeared, they all 3 lost interest and went into a smoothie shop, who somehow passed their order on to the waiter.  I just love that. How did they come up with a completely new personality type like that? I proved Rhiannon wrong last night when she said that "No band is unique. Not one." and then I ran rings around her logically.  You may call me obsessed, but I think there's so much depth in this thing that it deserves a little studying.  ...I type too much...
