Took me about 20 minutes to write, but there are boundaries I've learnt not to cross, and I feel I just about crossed them in what I wrote, so it's not there any more.  Look... in short, I'm off the lower end of unhappy at the moment.  Quote of the day: "I did not live until today. How can I live when we are parted? Tomorrow, you'll be worlds away, And yet with you my world has started."  Guess   Love, Jon Roskilly
