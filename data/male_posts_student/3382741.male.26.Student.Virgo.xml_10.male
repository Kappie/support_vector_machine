I could go into all that has been going on in Richard's life but frankly right now i don't care.  Suffice it to say that I am single again.  He said it's becuase of how much crap he has to deal with in his life right now and the distance.  whatever.  I will say that he has absolutely wonderful timing. NOT.  I wouldn't be that upset about it except for all the other junk in my life.  i still love him but was never in love with him so its not that big of a deal ... just one more log on the flames ... just salt rubbed in the wounds.  what i do see coming is the conversation tonight with my grandfather and pastor hawkins.  i am dreading this soo much.  i am supposed to let Kevin know how it goes so he knows what to expect on Wed night (he is going to be there along with several other friends it seems to suuport me).  It also seems there may be some people from the sc pride association (or something like that) as well as some other churchs in the area.  it sounds like its going to be a mad house.  i dont think i am really looking forward to that either.  well whatever happens .. my life will be different after wed ....
