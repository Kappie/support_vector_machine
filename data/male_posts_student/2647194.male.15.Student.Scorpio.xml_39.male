Its a minimum of 30-5 source cards, 25 note cards, and you can't use the damn backs!! GRRR....PLUS the 25 are due on Thursday. I haven't started my notes yet, since my thesis is absolute crap. I know what I'll be working on tonight and tommorow night, that's for sure...  On to the daily recap: Math: I actually got AHEAD in my assignments today....wow. Science: labs...again Band: At least I'll have jazz day to get me through Thursday...english hell! an hour and a half!!! Spanish: I honestly don't have any random spanish funnies today, as I was allowed to save myself from watching Legally Blonde 2 and work on math instead (hehe...yeah I'm a nerd lol). English: ::makes sour face:: Social: Presentations will continue tommorow. We did a worksheet today...how interesting.  Random Social funny (another class has these?! yes...it does): This was a one-time thing, as Mr. Pullar subbed for Mr. Schoeberlein for a while. Anton stood up on a chair and danced while Matt danced around on the floor wearing a skirt...Either Pullar didn't notice, or (the more likely) he didn't want it to stop...(burn!)  We also had Pullar for English too....what a drag.  Today was the day of subs: a sub for English, Social, and a substitute bus driver.  I have to leave, but before I do, I will end with a footnote this time.  Footnote: I must thank Amanda for giving me permission to utilize the previous lyric (lol).
