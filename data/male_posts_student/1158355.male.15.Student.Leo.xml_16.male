I think he's in the CIA. He thought I smelt like smoke but it was probably from an asshole in my math class who smokes all the time. He sits next to me. After the drug test my dad recieved his new computer and isn't using it yet so he gave me the monitor to use for a little while. Right now it's 7 and I'm still doing dam homework all the way from when I got home. Oh ya and half my bus never found my bus today and we saw our bus number and went in. I was the first one on and the bus driver said "Swim team?" and I said "Yes!" thinking he was joking. Finally some guy in a tight swim suit came on saying this is the swim team bus... it was so confusing but our bus finally came with some asshole who all we understood from his mouth was... WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAWA. I don't think he's from around hea yo. Jesus today's log just went completly backwards! Back to 7 PM, I'm working on an essay for SS and not having any time of the night to enjoy watching TV or something.
