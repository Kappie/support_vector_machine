From the "What Were They Thinking File"... Engand lost. I'm incredibly disappointed. N'aw well, the tourny's over for me; I don't care who wins now... They could blow the place up for all I care. Bah.  I went to Windsor with my mates the other day. I had hardly any money cause I spent it all the weekend before... Whoops! I hope we go again after I get paid. I did buy one thing though:  Donnie Darko  on DVD. Yay! If you haven't see  Donnie Darko  then you suck. And you need to rent it. I think I'll go watch it now.   So long.
