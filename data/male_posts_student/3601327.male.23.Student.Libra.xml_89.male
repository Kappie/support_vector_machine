He makes some interesting points and the commenters to his post also pose more questions worth considering.  One thing he doesn't address enough is that this is the nature of politics. The truly motivated are generally those who have the strongest values and also generally the most extreme and farthest from "mainstream" or "moderate." The truth is that over the long run moderates are usually the ones to win elections. Occasionally a very highly motivated group can excite a base on a particular issue just enough to elect the occasional prominent official (see the "Know-nothing" party of the 1850's). However, once the "base" sees the radical viewpoints for what they are and compare it to what they actually want, the radical candidate will lose the "base."  I don't think his lessons can be applied specifically to Republicans any more than they could be applied to Democrats or any other party. It is simply the nature of politics and the "mob" mentality that occasionally arises.
