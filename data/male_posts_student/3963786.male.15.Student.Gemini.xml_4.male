I guess maybe we just weren'tmeant to be. It felt right tho. It's weird, I kind of feel relieved, so maybe it wasn't that right. Or maybe I'm just lying to myself. Maybe if I had tried to get in touch with her a little more, or done something right, this wouldn't have happened. Well now I've got a open schedule, for the rest of the summer. This is kind of embarassing in all reality. That I could screw things up that bad that quickly and not know the right thing to do. Well I guess it's time to face it, it's over........
