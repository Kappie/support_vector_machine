But what the hell is a "Verdana"?   Don't know but it is the biggest one...   thats just me....trying to find the easiest way to do things....   Anyhow or "who" or "wayze"...whatever you like...this would be considered my first blog...   I use to have a zanga or xanaga...whatever the hell it was called, but I wrote nothin but two entries and fell off...   so this here is my second attempt to hold a blog/ man-journal....diary?...I think not..      So..."It's not what you do, it's how you do it..."   the name of my blog...   why?...   just cuz!...   naw...was listening to this CD that my co-worker Evertino shot to me a while back...   It's this hip-hop/jazz mix....   some old stuff..   some Gangstarr, Dead Prez, Davina feat. Xzibit..Roots...   stuff in that nature...   you know that 3am creep through the fog type music...   but yeah, there's this one cut on there...   I think it's Bahamadia...some female MC...   excuse me!    a great lyricist    for those who wanna say I don't know shit about hip-hop   "Aww, whut choo know bout Bahamadia?"   Purists....   Fuck em'   but gotta love their dedication....   back to the title name...   I use to think that just doing what you do on a daily basis would be enough to keep you sane...   does that make sense?..   like are you gonna walk like a square-bear...or walk...   ...David Banner..."Like a pimp"....   something to that extent...   can't really explain it right now...   maybe on my 10th entry I'll try to break it down...   that's if I even make it to a 10th or 4th..      I want to be on some swol status...like my homeboy Jeff...   but I'm just so damn lazy...   but I did work on my shoulders today...      spoke to my cousin JR or "JRGeezee"..   see he just recently moved out to Puerto Rico...   4 years at optometry school...   I wish him all the luck and success...   and the finest piece of PR dunk-a-dunk(s) on the planet..   Yadadameen....!   Bay area lingo...don't steal...   Ever...
