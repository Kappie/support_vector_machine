I mentioned some of the little facts I knew, like the Declaration of Independence was signed before July 4th, so Independence Day really isn't Independence Day. (Actually, since the Treaty of Paris acknowledging America's independence wasn't signed until 1783....Anyway.) She knew about the Boston Tea Party, but because of her accent I thought she said the cause of it was "Texas." After figuring it out I added that the "Texas" Americans had to pay were the lowest in the British Empire, and therefore probably the world. So sometimes when I think about America, I think it is a nation of whiny brats who like to eat. But on a more positive note, America is, well, so UN-American. On the 4th of July we sing our national anthem (British, look it up), drink beer (German), light firecrackers (Chinese) and celebrate our system of government (Roman, Greek, British, Iroquois, French, etc.) and our independence from foreign oppression (?) All of this country used to be owned by Natives, and we either got it from them or the British, French, Spanish, Dutch, Mexicans, Russians, Canadians, Hawaiians, or countless other people, usually by force or unfair land dealings. The Statue of Liberty was built in France. New York City is the home of the United Nations. And on and on. So if anything, be thankful that we are a nation of people from around the world who have worked harder than anyone to deserve the right to become whiny brats who like to eat. And if America=the world, God bless Americans.
