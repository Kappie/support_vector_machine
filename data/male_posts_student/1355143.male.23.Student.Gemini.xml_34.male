PERU!  yup, went and saw them almost embarrass Spain in Montjuic on yesterday, cracking goal put them one up but then the boring Spaniards finally put a couple of chances in the back of the net!  Stadium was almost empty and there were probly more Peruvian fans than Spanish (apart from the Nazi skinheads that Edgar sat next too, apparently thats what you get when you pay more for your ticket!), but the atmosphere was wicked as we sat right next to them and their big drum!  Had some friends from Madrid down on Saturday and tried our best to show them the sights and sounds of Barca, Steffen got rather drunk and begun to cross dress but luckily stopped at shoes!  Lovely photos to follow!  Looks like we might be goin to Karnaval in Sitges this weekend, thinking of what to dress up as,  any ideas?????  Got a call from Constance yesterday whilst we were at the footie, she saw ETA on the telly and heard Catalunya and thought we might all have been fried by some dirty bomb but we ok!  She seems to be doin well and by the sounds of it maquina hasnt corrupted the dancefloors of Madrid yet (lucky bastards!)  so tink I might find my way up there to rip up a dancefloor or two!  Tim - what particular idiot gets a bloody job that pays peanuts to afford a trip back to Barca and then gets told, by his BOSS!!!! that because of work commitments he cant get the time off!  Lay down the law Timmy boy, show him whos boss!  I want your arse here in March and thats my last word on the subject!  Walker - nice bird in the photo big man, got any goss, go on, make it explicit like Ulii ;op  Until the next time, sleep tight boys and girls, TTFN,  A
