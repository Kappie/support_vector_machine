Went to eat KFC at Clementi Central with Keith and Fabian in the afternoon. The ST2334(Probability and Statistics) tutorial was a disater. Disater as in I do not know how to do majority of the questions. Guess that I do have to skip lectures less often now. Discussed about some things over lunch with Keith and Fab. Then Fab told us a very funny thing after we brought up the topic of those secondary school students watching porno together. He told us that last time while he was in sec 1, he had a classmate who once took out his dick and start to masturbate in class while his teacher is teaching. He was actually teaching his fellow friends how to masturbate. Since its an all guys school, he dared to do it. This is really incredible. I laughed immediately after I heard that. How can a sec 1 student be so daring to be able to do that? And there must be something wrong with that guy's mentality at such a young age. Then Fab later explained that he came from the US and have experienced a lot of things. Well, still, he shouldn't have shown such disrespect to his teacher and his fellow peers.  After lunch, I went to the lab and waited for Fab and Keith to finish their tut. After that, left school at about 7pm as I am meeting my sisters, Esther, Edwin they all for bowling. Enjoyed myself thoroughly. Scored 134 and 138 for the 2 games played. Pretty satisfied although a bit disappointed at not bettering my personal high of 167..=p  After that, we went to Holland V for dinner. Dad ordered a lot of things and I ate until very full. However at the bad of my mind, I kept thinking about the CS4271 assignment due the next morning. It was not until 11.30pm before I reached home. Think have to pia throughout the night liao.. Till next time, Goodbye for now...  Nites...
