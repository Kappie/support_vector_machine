Of Bulfrogs and Butterflies (an odd, symbolic story)  Parian Sword (might be set in fudal Japan, i haven't decide yet)  Three Shakes of a Lamb's Tail (i know, i'm a sucker for happy endings. must be finished by August 6th)  "story" (doesn't have a name yet, based on a wierd dream that i had)  plus other stories that i haven't thought up yet!    but i thought kevin hated writing?  kevin likes to write, IF he gets to write about something he likes and IF it turns out the way he wants (barely ever happens)  progress so far... i have the first 5 episodes of Legacy of the Shooting Stars done, but i'm going to redo them because they weren't perfect (i'm getting way too much like my sister, aren't i?)
