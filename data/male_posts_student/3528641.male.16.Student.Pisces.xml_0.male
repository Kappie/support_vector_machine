I'm hopin she's not ugly. Okay, this is the deal--I saw her but it was in the dark and I was up close to her but i didnt look at her directly but I really don't think she is ugly..well I'm hopin. And I know it's not all about looks but I just hope she has some looks cuz I'm gonna have to look at her. But neway, my fried Marie came over today and we chilled. She is one of my best friends. We always have stuff to talk about. We walked to this dude named Demetrius' house. He lives in the neighborhood beside mine. He is my other best friend (and also has something going on with Marie:)uh-oh). So we walk down there and come back in the dark. We got back and talked to Demetrius on the phone and watched tv. OH!! While me and Marie were walkin, Nicole (that girl i met@ the club)--her friend called and said she wouldnt be able to talk cuz she was still sick, so I called Nicole later and expressed to her that I was sorry we wouldnt be able to talk and that I hoped she would get better soon. She had lost her voice about 2 nights ago and it was still gone. So I'm hopin for the best. We are going to mail each other pictures of ourselves. She thought of it first (another reason I dont think she's ugly). But she's too good to be true.... So now I have to go take some pictures and make sure I'm lookin nice in them. Huh, Demetrius will not sing for nething. We're best friends!! I dont know why he wont just sing. He doesnt sound bad. I wish he would stop bein a punk and stop bein so nervous. He shouldnt feel nervous or scared around me. But whatever, I guess it comes with time. He'll start to feel more comfortable around me sooner or later. I have to go to my camps in 3 more days. I hope I have good roomates. Hugh...please Lord let me have good roomates. Well I know this wasn't as interesting as before but you'll be alright.  Keep the peace, LaRon
