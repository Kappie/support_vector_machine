Well you choose  Oh, look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone, Oh well, it seems like such fun until you lose what you had won, Oh, look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone A fool of everyone, A fool of everyone  Take my photo of the wall if it just won't sing for you, 'Cause all that's left has gone away and there's nothing there for you to do  Oh, look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone, Oh well, it seems like such fun until you lose what you had won, Oh, look what you've done, you've made a fool of everyone A fool of everyone, A fool of everyone     Vindicated  by Dashboard Confessional   Hope dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption  Winding in and winding out  The shine of it has caught my eye  And roped me in  So mesmerizing, and so hypnotizing  I am captivated,  I am...   [Chorus]  Vindicated  I am selfish  I am wrong  I am right  I swear I'm right  Swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well  I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself   So clear  Like the diamond in your ring  Cut to mirror your intention  Oversized and overwhelmed  The shine of which has caught my eye  And rendered me so isolated, so motivated  I am certain now that I am...   [Chorus]   So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x]  So let me slip against the current  So let me slip away [4x]   [Chorus]   Like hope  Dangles on a string  Like slow spinning redemption...
