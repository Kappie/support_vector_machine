You think i lend to someone.Nooo.!! i broke it few months ago against a wall, i guess i was angry at something. Anyways, its not the right time to discuss that. I went to Lahore just before the long weekend here, visited Hasan, a childhood friend of mine and a good colleague aswell. We roam around in the bustling city and ended up buying myself a guitar. I am a gutar freak, you see. I have been playing guitar for twelve years now, started it off when i could hardly get it in my hands, but that was fun. I have always been inspired by Santana and then there was Bryan Adams. The one i got now is a Semi-Accoustic one, like the one you can mix softies on. It does support hard but softies sounds marvelous on it, and i love to play softies when im down....Ooopsss..!! thats a secret..!! LOL Gosh...if you peeps know what time is here, will definately kill me, LOL..!! but i aint sleepy, told you i cant put off before 4, but its past 4 already. I dont know what should i do? hmmmmm, like i better play some tunes but then all the other peeps are sleeping sound in their rooms, yeah and i dont want them to bust me in the morning or like as we speak. I better get outta here or else do some posts to my mates. i havent done that like in 5 days now. I think should be nice to others, LOL...!!
