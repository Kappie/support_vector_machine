Do you know why?  "I'm sad..... but at the same time I'm really happy that something could make me feel that sad.  Its like, it makes me feel alive, you know?  It makes me feel human.  And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt something really good before.  So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I'm feeling is like a...a beautiful sadness."  - Butters  Being with you is one of the greatest feelings known to humankind.  Not being with you is like that sadness, like that sort of sadness, where everything has no point, nothing is important.  But when I feel that, then I know that there is something there to be greatly happy for.  Being with you, I have experienced so many emotions I never felt before about anyone.    I know I've told you this before.............. and this is very open......... but thats how it is.  Am I alone in thinking this?  Am I alone in these...... emotions?  Its like I'm waiting for something...... waiting for a sign or something.  I can't assume things.  I can only hope.
