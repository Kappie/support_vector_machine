It's a Michael Mooresque--sensationalist documentary, and as enjoyable as it was I felt this movie was lacking a little.  Don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy the movie. I find the topic to be fascinating, and I have to give kudos to the star/director, Morgan Spurlock, for coming up with the ingenious idea of capitalizing off one of the strangest aspects of modern culture. Despite the topic, the movie lacked the speed and coherence of most of Moore's documentaries and I think that as his debut movie Spurlock almost nearly hits the nail on the head.  Yes, this movie does have a message: eat mcdonalds and you'll die-- but it lacks the planning, and information to really get the point across. The movie ends up being a 2 hour circus show-- with some white guy scarfing and puking up quarter pounders. It disappointed me because Spurlock ends up meeting all these really interesting characters like Don Gorske, a John Lennon look-alike who is addicted to Big Macs due to his Obsessive Compulsive disorder. The most interesting thing about Gorske is he is in great shape despite the 19,500 Big Mac Attack.  You also meet some insanely overweight guy who is about to get his tummy tucked- and in some amazing cinematography you get to see the procedure accomplished. The problem is Spurlock goes nowhere with these interesting, and bizarre people. You don't get to see how Gorske lives- and let me tell you where there is smoke there is fire... I am willing to bet Gorkse's house was insane, talk to his wife for 5 minutes and I bet you'll hear some good stories. The tummy tuck guy dissaperes after the surgery- you don't see or hear from him again- what would have been interesting is if Spurlock came back to see the man and offered him a supersized McDonalds Combo-- just to see how much of it the guy could eat. What would have been even better is if Spurlock took all his doctors and some of these weird people in a bus, and drove down to McDonalds headquarters to not only make a scene,  but also to announce the results of Spurlock's evil diet.   Ultimately the movie was boring, there were too many scenes showing him going to the doctor, and too many scenes of him doing nothing. The movie didnt have enough weight behind it, it deviates off topic a bit, and the interesting characters are not put to good use. I suggest people watch the movie, but don't expect much-- the movie falls short of being a classic, but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. So cheers to Spurlock, the movie may have taken 10 years off your life, but I'm sure it was worth it.
