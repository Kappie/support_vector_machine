     
      Don't let your parents down, They brought you up.  Be humble enough to obey, You may give orders someday.  Choose companions with care, You become what they are.  Guard your thoughts, What you think, you are.  Choose only a date Who would make a good mate.  Be master of your habits, or they will master you.  Don't be a show off when you drive. Drive with safety and arrive.  Don't let the crowd pressure you, Stand for something or you'll fall for anything.
