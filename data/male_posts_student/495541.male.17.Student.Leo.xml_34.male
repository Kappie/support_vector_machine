It all started when I found a host that was cheaper and had better features.  So I canceled my account and signed up with a new host.  That's when bad things started to happen.  First thing was that they charged me the whole 12 months worth of service instead of just the month like I thought I had selected on the option box.  I was wrong I guess.  Then I realized that their Unix plan had no option for multiple FTP accounts.  Then I wouldn't be able to host other people's sites without letting them have my FTP information.  Then I found out it would be $30 charge and a downtime of four days.  All to change it from Unix to Windows 2000 so I can have a few more FTP accounts.  Now there's no way that a Unix server wouldn't be able to have multiple FTPs!  They just want to restrict it to Windows 2000 I guess.  So if I'm going to want that in the future, I'm going to have to pay $30 and wait four days.  In addition to that, I'm currently in the process of just changing my DNS servers on my domain which is taking forever.  Network Solutions is not really doing a very good job of keeping a customer happy.  They don't care though because everyone has to register through them sooner or later.  Other than that I've been pretty busy with off-season stuff.  I'm getting used to it so I'm not complaining as much.  :-)  Until later.
