Despite my grades pretty consistently matching my expectations I still get kind of nervous/excited when I see them for the first time.  And then I see them, and they look like I expect them to, and I realize it didn't really make sense to care that much about them, since they're pretty much what I thought they would be.  Whatever.  No disasters, no surprises.
