I want to get my butt into the fall sessions at A.C.A.D., so I have to get a portfolio of recent work together, along with umm....an essay of what is up with...me. I'm 45 years old, and most of the time I really don't know what is up with me. I seem to move from one thing to another in an effort to, what.. get it right? I may never get it right. Whatever it is. Into drawing classes now. Just starting actually. More challenges. I've got to read more. Books that is..
