After that, I am free to update the site as often as I want to. Maybe i'll actually use this site for what it was originally meant to be; a place to share all kinds of writing, by me, as well as Randy, and some other guest writer's. Hopefully, we'll have Shawn write some stuff for the site... we just got to get him an account. As well as writing ability. We'll work on both of those, ol chap.  I really lost track of "The White Experience", as work just piled up and it became too much of a chore to find it, edit it, and post it. Maybe White will be back this summer with more of his crazy views. Right after he leaves the insane aslyum, due to his Sharks choking in the Eastern Conference final. *Insert the Price is Right losing horn*.  I've been working on a lot of writing... some short stories, a few poems, scripts (!!), as well as a series of articles that i've labled "High School Chronicles". I'm proud of them, so once I have time, i'd like to start putting them to print and testing them here.  There's a lot of choices i've made about where I am going with my life in the next few years, and writing is definitley a major part of it. I've decided i'd like to try and become a high school teacher, and gain acceptance to a concurrent program at Brock University, where i'll be able to earn a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Education at the same time. Hopefully, my writing can be a big part of this, as there's many projects i'd like to work on while i'm still young.  I have a lot of aspirations, and it's time I started the next stage of my life. Hope you're all in for the ride, it's bound to be a good one... and at the very least, it'll be great to see me mess up a lot.  I figure if I become a teacher, i'm gonna have the summer off... that will be a great oppurtunity to explore different possibilities with my writing. I can work on  side-projects, and maybe even open my own business someday. Yeah, my mind's going in weird directions lately, but i'm happy with the choices I have either already made, or am about to make.  High school only has one more year left for me... it's going to be an interesting one. Hopefully experience new things, new people, and probably new problems... but they are ones I am willing to face. I plan on keeping this site up to date regularly, so you can all read along my (hopefully) interesting next few years.  As for the blog, we're trying to set up a new template and an easier comment system. Try the stuff out... we now have profiles (only mine is up at the moment, Randy's will be up shortly). Tell us how you think the new layout looks.  Well, that's about it... hopefully me and Randy can update this thing with good frequency, and with good articles. Thanks for reading, you all rock.  "You let him watch those damn Muppets... I mean, they've got a frog kissing a pig... what did they think was gonna happen?"
