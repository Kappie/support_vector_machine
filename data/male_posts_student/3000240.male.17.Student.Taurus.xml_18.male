This game is absolutely huge from my point of view, as, quite usually from my prospective, I'm outspoken as I feel this will be the absolute making of Ranieri as Chelsea manager. If he, like I hope to God he will, lead us to our first victory over them since 99' in the League Cup, then he will be well and truly be taking us up another level, however if we lose over the tie then I'd rightly say his time is up. The guy has with the team during in the course of the season, despite the constant close-knit victories, only a handful of absolutely decent performances (i.e. Newcastle at home), the rest of the time we were lucky and at the right place at the right time. True, I believe whoever leads the team next season, we will improve on this one, but shouldn't a manager who can play attacking football and still better the results Ranieri's getting be in charge? His style, baffling tactics, lack of understanding what even his best team is, surely stifling the gelling of the team, and causing already reported public unrest within squad. I have thought however he is a decent man, with morals and dignity, especially throughout the constant barrage of pressure he's faced this season, and I do want him to do well, but oh well at the moment we can get any manager in the world who's mind would be swayed by money (which is practically all of them) so why stay with Ranieri, a pretty average-good manager, just for the fact of being just and that there's no absolute must-have reason to get rid of him, when we can get a world class manager i.e Arsene Wenger clone, which Ranieri I'm afraid to say isn't. Roman Abramovich as I'm sure your all well aware of didn't get to the top of the business world by not being absolutely ruthless and in the words of old Santa-Claus Ken Bates, he is an absolutely brilliant business man, so what chance does Ranieri have anyway?  Anyway, we have been beaten by them for years. I can remember stretching back to junior school that I used to come home on a Sunday from one occasion or another, that we had - inevitably - been defeated well by them once again. My theory (like the one's why Tottenham can't beat us nor we beating Blackburn at home) is that every team has a style that never well and truly changes over the years, and we are a lesser form of Arsenals, and always have. Any team who plays the same style or one less efficient than Arsenals 99/100 will be beaten, and Chelsea have never been the 1/100 via fate and God I guess. Arsenal are without a doubt, like AC Milan at the moment, awesome. If they had a decent Right back, which (like I think they will in the summer if they lure Hasem Trabelsi from our grasp when his contract runs out at Ajax) they'd be perfect. The only way in which we will beat them will either be a 0-0 at the Bridge and a 1-1 at Highbury, which lets face it is highly unlikely considering that Arsenal will score tonight whatever defence we put out, they always do, and can shut out shop at Highbury, which they've never really had to do too much, but they would defend there by attacking and inevitably score, which is by far the best form of defence; or by nullifying Viera and dominating the midfield, which lets face it is the hardest job in football. We'll have to be on top of our game no doubt about it, and they'd have to have a rare off day. I live in pessimism and hope rather than expectation, and lets face it tonight, most Chelsea fans are after the 3 2-1 defeats to them already this season. Despite also Arsenal showing signs of fatigue, I think they're an intelligent enough team to know that once they recently annihilated Bolton et al recently, to let of the pedal to reserve energy for the 4 major ties that lay ahead of them, and beside they have a well-documented history of being able to raise their game and staying calm when the going gets tough.  Fear will hold us prisoner, hope will let Arsenal score. In my opinion it's a no win situation for Chelsea, but wouldn't it be sweet if . . . . . . . . . make sure you watch it tonight, whatever happens it will be one hell of a match.  xBuBzx
