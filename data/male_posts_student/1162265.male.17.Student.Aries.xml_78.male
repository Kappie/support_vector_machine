School sucked, considering I forgot to go to Novemsky to get make-up work, and I have to take a quiz for Mastellone that I haven't even studied for during study (which is when I usually study for math).  School sucks the most at the end of the year, because the sense of time completely slows down or speeds up to such a degree that I don't realize what's going on.  I really don't expect people to understand this, but it was the poem that I had in my mind today from the "Last Poets".   Niggers Are Scared of Revolution  Niggers are scared of revolution But niggers shouldn't be scared of revolution Because revolution is nothing but change And all niggers do is change  Niggers come in from work and change into pimping clothes and hit the streets to make some quick change  Niggers change their hair from black to red to blond and hope like hell their looks will change  Nigger kill other niggers Just because one didn't receive the correct change  Niggers change from men to women, from women to men Niggers change, change, change  You hear niggers say          Things are changing?  Things are changing? Yeah, things are changing Niggers change into 'Black' nigger things Black nigger things that go through all kinds of changes The change in the day that makes them rant and rave          Black Power!  Black Power! And the change that comes over them at night, as they sigh and moan:          White thighs, ooh, white thighs  Niggers always goin' through bullshit change But when it comes for real change, Niggers are scared of revolution    Niggers are actors, niggers are actors Niggers act like they are in a hurry to catch the first act of the 'Great White Hope'  Niggers try to act like Malcolm And when the white man doesn't react  toward them like he did Malcolm Niggers want to act violently  Niggers act so coooool and slick causing white people to say: What makes you niggers act like that? Niggers act like you ain't never seen nobody act before But when it comes to acting out revolution Niggers say: 'I can't dig them actions!' Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers are very untogether people Niggers talk about getting high and riding around in 'els' Niggers should get high and ride to hell Niggers talk about pimping          Pimping that, pimping what          Pimping yours, pimping mine          Just to be pimping, is a helluva line  Niggers are very untogether people Niggers talk about the mind Talk about: My mind is stronger than yours "I got that bitch's mind uptight!" Niggers don't know a damn thing about the mind Or they'd be right Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers fuck.  Niggers fuck, fuck, fuck Niggers love the word fuck They think it's so fuckin' cute They fuck you around The first thing they say when they're mad: 'Fuck it' You play a little too much with them They say 'Fuck you' When it's time to TCB, Niggers are somewhere fucking Try to be nice to them, they fuck over you  Niggers don't realize while they doin' all this fucking They're getting fucked around And when they do realize it's too late So niggers just get fucked up  Niggers talk about fucking Fuckin' that, fuckin' this, fuckin' yours, fuckin' my sis Not knowing what they're fucking for They ain't fucking for love and appreciation Just fucking to be fucking.  Niggers fuck white thighs, black thighs, yellow thighs, brown thighs Niggers fuck ankles when they run out of thighs          Niggers fuck Sally, Linda, and Sue          And if you don't watch out          Niggers will fuck you! Niggers would fuck 'Fuck' if it could be fucked But when it comes to fucking for revolutionary causes Niggers say 'Fuck revolution!' Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers are players, niggers are players, are players Niggers play football, baseball and basketball while the white man cuttin' off their balls  When the nigger's play ain't tight enough to play with some black thighs, Niggers play with white thighs to see if they still have some play left And when there ain't no white thighs to play with Niggers play with themselves  Niggers tell you they're ready to be liberated But when you say 'Let's go take our liberation' Niggers reply: 'I was just playin' Niggers are playing with revolution and losing Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers do a lot of shootin' Niggers do a lot of shootin'  Niggers shoot off at the mouth Niggers shoot pool, niggers shoot craps Niggers cut around the corner and shoot down the street Niggers shoot sharp glances at white women Niggers shoot dope into their arm  Niggers shoot guns and rifles on New Year's Eve A new year that is coming in The white police will do more shooting at them Where are niggers when the revolution needs some shots!? Yeah, you know.  Niggers are somewhere shootin' the shit Niggers are scared of revolution   Niggers are lovers, niggers are lovers are lovers Niggers love to see Clark Gable make love to Marilyn Monroe Niggers love to see Tarzan fuck all the natives Niggers love to hear the Lone Ranger yell "Heigh Ho Silver!"  Niggers love commercials, niggers love commercials Oh how niggers love commercials: "You can take niggers out of the country, but  you can't take the country out of niggers"  Niggers are lovers, are lovers, are lovers Niggers loved to hear Malcolm rap But they didn't love Malcolm Niggers love everything but themselves  But I'm a lover too, yes I'm a lover too I love niggers, I love niggers, I love niggers  Because niggers are me And I should only love that which is me I love to see niggers go through changes Love to see niggers act Love to see niggers make them plays and shoot the shit  But there is one thing about niggers I do not love Niggers are scared of revolution.   It really is a pretty heavy poem.  My mom was suprised I listened to the Poets considering it was big when she was in High School.... Oh well, I'm a throwback to the 70's.
