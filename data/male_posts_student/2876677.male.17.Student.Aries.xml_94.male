For instance, DID YOU KNOW that this young lady starts out the day with rum.  Jcarlos287: breakin'out the bubbly triquetta16: i wanted to talk to your parents tonite about the way you dress but apparently you all are skipping church to get drunk Jcarlos287: alright patty...i need to go get drunk now triquetta16: just dont drive home like that Jcarlos287: we have a designated driver patty Jcarlos287: and some people find my fat hanging over my pants attractive Jcarlos287: so whatever  Can you really trust a girl like this?  How do you know she wasn't drunk when she wrote her post?  Also on the obeisity issue, drop a pant size or ten before you try to talk about my fat.  Seriously,  if you have never met "her", I would encourage you not too.  If you would like to see "her" go to Wal-mart.  She will be in the Plus size section(Large sizes  for girls who need to drop a few)...or McDonald's.  It is not a sight you will forget.  She also is a husband batterer.  She can become extremely violent if you try to take her Crispy Creme.  She denies this of course.  The first step in the healing process is admitting you have a problem.  Also "unnamed girl", all is a noun, pronoun, adjective and adverb.  Leave comments about your feelings toward my co-blogstress.
