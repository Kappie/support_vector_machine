No matter how unhappy that makes me, if I've got to invest in this area for a few years, there are worse things.    I have yet to really commit to this initiative of mine.  I need to do it...throw myself at film, and not turn back.  This is it right now.  Nothing else.  And if it doesn't happen, then we move to Plan B.
