It's called "California, Uber Alles" by "The Dead Kennedys". It's really cool. Punk-rock-ish. Still good, though. I'm supposed to be working on my math homework. Yes, I have homework over the summer. All because I got an F on my Math grade. Middle School grades don't even matter, but "the study habbits, do" quote my parents. I really don't care about my grades,  too  much, but... Oh well. I got the VBS Volunteer Jr. sheet. Waiting for Anna to say if I should go all day, or not. Speaking of which, she has been plotting my death for a while. I'm starting to get a little afraid. "If she brings a rolled-up carpet, run for your life" quote "Trooper". I'm trying to figure out how to put background music on my blog, just because the music that I like, I think sounds good. Heidi is  very  nice to go out of her way and fax me the sheets. Thank you, if you're reading this! It's pretty boring at camp, now. Our show's on the 2nd, if anyone wants to see my "acting prowess" quote well, Me, of course. Kukuku.    All the people going to VBS with me, we're going to see a movie after the first day. Dodgeball is what Anna and I decided on. Either that, or Spiderman 2. The Pleasant Hill "Century 16" theater is good, because it has DDR, despite the long-ish drive. I'm really looking forward to meeting everyone at VBS. It sounds fun, but I'm just afraid that on like, the last day, Anna will carry out her death-plan. *Shudder*. Oh well, all I can do now, is write my will. Anyone want anything in paticular?   [Edit] We're not going to see Dodgeball, so we'll see Spiderman 2. I figured out how to get the music on the background up and running. The song is called "California Uber Alles". Good song, good song.
