I was a little bit younger than I am now, maybe early teens. Our class (I'm guessing, though I didn't know anyone) was on some field trip through a building, perhaps, a museum. Its architecture was new-age industrial, but that doesn't matter. Anyways, for some reason, I was an assassin, but my weapon of choice? hefty coins that I chucked at people's heads (Â¦P). Apparently, my targets were just about anyone; it was completely random. No one else seemed to notice that I was taking out people from behind with those big old coins. So we get near some kind of unisex bathroom (since EVERYONE was going through it and it was part of the tour >_ _ _ _Here it is:  Lately, I've been remembering several of my dreams... I just thought I'd share the most recent and memorable one.... So, my family, my cousin's family, and I are at this hotel, vacationing, and we decide to go down and do some sight-seeing. We end up in this interactive museum/aquarium (figures, I'd dream us to a nerdy place). Anyways, there are these exhibits which are actually pretty cool, cuz' you see through these windows, and there are entire expansive environments contained within them. One of them was this beach set up, and inside, this lil' ferret-looking thing pops out of a the water in the distance. For sum reason, ppl show up inside and start playing with it. Then, the ferret thing transforms O_o, into a sandwich and a bunhc of other things. It crawls close to the window, and my sister says, "that's not a bear" for some reason, and then it turns into a cartoony bear XP. The bear turns into a slot machine kinda thing and starts spewing out these lil' prizes (don't ask). I get most of the prizes, which makes no sense. Then my cousin's lil' sister complains about not having received any. We leave the exhibit, but she stays behind and gets rejcted by the bear >.  _I don't know why a lot of my dreams take place in buildings like that. The architecture was really neat though. Although, some room transitions are physically impossible (>_
