Fuck the shotgun, you get a chainsaw.   Weapons that use bullets or shells, or anything for that matter, that you have to use from even a short distance, are for girls and gay firemen.     A real man gets his hands dirty by digging a chainsaw vertically into a screaming demon's skull.   Oh yeah the game might have a story line too.    So like yeah, after I was done being very one-thousand three-hundred thirty-seven, I get an email.  My application got accepted for Reality! I'm writing for the newspaper! I am very happy!   This is almost as much fun as  Doom , but still... c'mon,  chainsaws, people.    My day was almost perfect, except for when my aunt and the kids came to visit again for the next two weeks.  But by the time I get up, they're usually going to sleep anyway.  And I am going to wildwood for about a week tomorrow so I don't really care.   Whateverzors.    It's going to be hard to fuck up my day now.         [cutscene to sam watching his house burn down, while it starts to rain fecal matter]
