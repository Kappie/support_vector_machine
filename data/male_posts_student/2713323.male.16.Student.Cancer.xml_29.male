Neehows did a whole lot of nothing yesterday and today, stayed at home and stuff like that. We had a bbq 2 days back, man it was smashing! Many turned up, and i got Mrs Pereira to throw up the horns. Heh. Disappointing, Rebecca didnt come even though this bbq was set for her...she chose to go out with her other friends. DOH. No wonder she had to come over to chaichee, she probaly thinks that we are too low class for her or something. After everyone left, it was eden, me, jonathan, c.k and kel left. We ate like dogs, cleared the chicken wings and satays...very fun, should have more of these. I took out 4 cans of Barons and 2 shots of vodka ice...felt a little high, kel took 7 barons, he was still going on strong. But when we reached his house we couldnt sleep and i ended up snoozing at about 6am. The hell? But it was worth it. Anyway, hope u can make it for the date tml hui!
