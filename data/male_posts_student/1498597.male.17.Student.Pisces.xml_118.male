It was on TechTV that a certain percent of blogs post maybe ONE entry and thats it. Can you believe that? Someone starts a blog and just abandons it later. What a waste of time.  Why do I bring up that subject? Because this blog is like a flower, its slowly withering away from lack of energy and resources. Hence, I propose the  Blog Revitilization Plan . Under this plan, many things will occur:      New Quote Every 14 Days.  Yes, this is something that we need to keep doing... changing the quote! That will help keep the page fresh and up-to-date. As you can tell, I have already updated the quote for this period of time.     Periodic Review of CDs, Books, Movies...  Perhaps reviews are the next thing that we should tackle....? Every now and then, one of us can post the latest movie that we have seen and what not. Or perhaps the latest book that we finished or a CD that we recently purchased.     We Will Become the "Three Eye Witnesses Official News Source"  That's right. You will now read articles pertaining to Three Eye Witnesses, Inc. affairs and what not. Every now and then we will tell you what is planned in the future and little details like that.    With all of these improvements being planned, hopefully this blog will become the place to come and read from daily, or perhaps weekly if need-be. Don't give up on checking for updates! Keep coming back for more...stuff.  Thank you to everyone.... including our loyal readers!  Like  always ..... stay tuned!
