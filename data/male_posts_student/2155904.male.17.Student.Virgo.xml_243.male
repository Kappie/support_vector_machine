Every time Tyke could, he has blogged and that streak has been going for months.  This would have been a stupid way to break it.  By simply forgetting.  Well today had a little more action in it than yesterday.  But not that much still.  Tyke got up to the nice sun and then a little later got a nice burst of energy.  Maybe it was from the donut he cut up and slowly chewed for 5 minutes before finally finishing it off.  The whole mouth thing is getting annoying now.  Sure, Tyke has had it really easy with the operation and post-op health but he still really wants to be able to chew and he still can't other than with his front teeth.  So he ate the donut like a gopher or rabbit or something but it still tasted wonderfully.  Later on he went downstairs and saw that the sheets on his bed really needed to be changed.  So he did that and then noticed that the floor was messy so he vacuumed the downstairs.  He did it quickly and it wasn't a great job but it still was good enough.  At least it doesn't look like it's dirty.  It still probably is but if it doesn't look it then nobody cares.  Then he just sat and watched tv for hours.  At dinner time he popped a fettucine alfredo in the microwave and took his time eating that.  Then he got called by Naan/Footsies and they invited him to dinner at Thai Ginger.  He was up for it even though he couldn't eat/already did.  There was Purdy, Ekul, Naan, Footsies, Red Sox/Kalia (did Tyke name her Red Sox first? he can't remember), and Christmas Carol.  It was a good dinner.  Tyke drank a lot of water and that was it but he chatted it up with Ekul and Naan and Purdy and Footsies.  So it was quite enjoyable.  Then he went home and got kinda tired so he ended up not doing anything.  He did play 2 hours of Empire Poker with Kinker though.  That was pretty fun for a while.  Then Tyke got up to leave but realized he hadn't blogged so he came back and did that.  It really was a close one.  But Nene was also online tonight so they talked for a little and they are going to hang out sometime soon now that she is back.  Maybe he'll visit her at work tomorrow.  Except he doesn't know when she works so maybe not.  And she doesn't want him to so there's another reason not to.  Yeah, well time for Tyke to actually go to sleep.  Hmmm...he's getting hungry now.  Maybe he'll sneak a snack from...ah crap he can't eat anything really.  Grrr...  EDIT: It's funny how things work out, isn't it?  Tyke almost forgot to blog tonight and now he is doing a second blog in the same night.  But Tyke can't sleep so he needed something to calm his mind and hopefully ease his troubled mind.  And he didn't really feel like taking Vicodin to do so.  But then he wrote out a long blog and thought that it was too personal and revealing so he shouldn't share it.  Sorry if you were looking forward to reading something interesting from Tyke but he knows he can't be too forward on here.  It isn't anonymous and problems can arise from what Tyke says.  He certainly doesn't want to make his current situation any worse than it is so he is going to have to just tell you that the reason he can't sleep tonight is because of love.  His mind is racing with what-ifs and self-doubt and other hopes and dreams that Tyke knows can't come true for him.  It is a tough idea to cope with and Tyke might not truly cope with it.  He might just end up forgetting about it but he thinks that if he were to be face to face with his "problem" in 10 years, he would remember exactly how he felt for this past year.  It's just one of those things.
