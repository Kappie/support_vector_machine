That sounds like Dio.... lmao and he suddenly starts sing "his names Dio, Ronnie James Dio". Simple things amuse simple m1nds..... i guess. It sure did make me feel better. I’m now sitting here with a stupid grin on my face.  Guess this year's been the year of Punk for me. At least I Fund something happy-sad-mellow-snappy to listen to, to keep me going on.  While i was biking to school, I kept thinking as to why I need women in my life. All I’ve ever got from them is hurt.. hurt by everyone. I guess i have this script buried deep inside that's always told me to stay away from people, I guess that’s why I’m am so .. I don’t know.  Still searching for a job, nothing seems to be working out. I've been applying no more replies. I applied for an internship in Turkey through AEISEC, it’s a .NET job. I still haven’t heard from them. The Chinese internship is gonna work out to be too very expensive I can’t afford it. The job from B'lore has been put on hold, till I get back. Knowing my luck, it would have been filled up when I get there.  Haven’t done any work, by the time I decided to do something I found out that i have the wrong version with me [sheesh me], Heading home, hopefully I may do some work done. I think I will show Pete as much as I’ve finished so that I can start the documentation process and be done with it soon.
