I'm working on a new presentation too.  Plus I get games on this thing.  Its a Compaq 5300 LTE with interchangeable CD/Floppy Drive.  Pretty bitchin with a P133 mhz processer and a 1.26 Gig HD.  Not bad for $75.  Too bad I have to dish more than the laptop for a battery.  Damn technology to hell....
