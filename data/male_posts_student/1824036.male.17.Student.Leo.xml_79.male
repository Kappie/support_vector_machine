My Chemistry teacher gives me one look and says nope sorry you cant do the lab. I'm like why not, but then it hit me. For safety reasons (which our school has a lot of) you have to wear long pants on days you have a lab. Just in case you spill an acid on yourself or something to that nature. But I dont mind a whole lont. I will have to start doing my homework tonight and get to bed earlier than usual (maybe 10:30 after  urlLink That 70's Show  is over. I love that show. It is so funny.
