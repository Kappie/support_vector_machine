It says feminism's view of equality has inspired ideologies which "call into question the family, in its natural two-parent structure of mother and father, and to make homosexuality and heterosexuality virtually equivalent".  Personally, I think the Church should stop trying to regain control of its followers' minds and start renewing its ideas. This new document - and any other document like this in the history of the Catholic faith - was written with  control  in mind. Control over Catholics' lifestyle, ideas and most importantly: creativity. In order for the Roman Catholic institution to survive over the past 1,700 years, it hasn't allowed any opposing or personal views upon the faith. (If you doubt this, look up any article dealing with the "Albigensian Crusades") Only when you practice  blind faith  in the words of the Church - and only then - will you make it to heaven. Anything else is blasphemous. The Church has been making concessions the past 20 years or so, but with pain in its heart, and never on the most important topics, which deal with freedom of body and soul. It's not so much that today the Church is outdated, its that we freed ourselves from its grip and left it behind like we leave behind a bad idea.
