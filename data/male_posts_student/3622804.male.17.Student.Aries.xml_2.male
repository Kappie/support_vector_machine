Anyways, on to my life story for today. John Gladwin, my Study skills teacher, is a farking genius. I mean it. He knows everything and anything about knowledge. He looks in his 50s, but Sean thinks he's in his 60's and John Gladwin is really really really smart.. i mean it. Anyways he said my individual presentation is going along fine and that all i have to do is restructure my headings for my topics. And he was wondering why this singaporean boy was doing smth to be passed up in week 7, but now was only week 5... kiasu lors..... LOLX  Math was damn good.. cuz i managed to do all the sums.. I'm happy that now i'm better at maths. YIPPEE! So anyways, we went to Mercato shopping mall where sean loaned me money to buy lunch cuz me mum forgot to give me cash... As usual.... (i remember i borrowed $2 from mellie.. and paid her back 10 months later... lol...)   The heat was totally unbearable and we took an hour nap inside Sean's Jeep... and then went to business class where we did a case study on Mcdonalds.. and it's MCDOMINATION OF THE WORLD...       -_-'  And now i sit.. alone in the university awaiting my mum to pick me up.. Have microsoft word test tmr... wish me luck fellow frens... BB..  Love you and get better soon k Mellie?  ZZ is the best guy ever.. :) lol...  DD
