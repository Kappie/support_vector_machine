Her pneumonia symptoms are slowly clearing up.  No more cough, but still has laboured breathing.    Since last Wednesday, I've been living on my own, and that will end today when Scott and Sue return from their vacation to Fruitvale and Kelowna.  I've been feeding their cat Kittles for them while they've been gone.  She is the strangest cat I've ever seen.  She's so anti-social, she makes hermits look outgoing and friendly.  Since they left, she's become a recluse, hiding here and there, only coming out to eat and look for Scott.  But in that time, I saw Spiderman 2, possibly one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Totally enjoyed it!  I really enjoyed the performance of Rosemary Harris and Alfred Molina.  They really made the movie for me.  Their characters were very well performed.  James Franco did a good job, NOT!  He played the easiest role of all.  The spoiled rich kid who wants revenge cause someone has wronged him.  Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst did well in their roles, but they didn't change all that much from the first movie, which I loved as well.  Friday night was a night in enjoying the Busch Series race, while Saturday night was the same, except I enjoyed most of a quart of rum and the NASCAR race from Daytona.  Sunday was a day of nothingness.  Lots of sleep, a really good supper and lots of Simpsons.  Yesterday was back to work.  A good day of photoshop-ing some pictures for the library screensaver!  THANKS STEPH!!!  I got lots done and enjoyed a nice quiet shift on the media desk.  As for my ebay winnings, last Friday, the boxed sets of Robotech started to arrive.  Sadly, set #5 arrived on Friday, and as you can guess where this is going, Boxed set #4 arrived last night.  So last night, I cleaned up the little mess I had made in the house, had a nice supper of fish and green beans and while watching some of the Robotech Masters series.  Dana Sterling, Marie Crystal, Bowie, Angelo Dante...just like I remembered them.  WWE RAW was on, then I played around for a bit on my PC, read some more of the new book I started, The Lone Drow and hit the sack.  Now for my rant!  My Mom called last night to say my phone bill from Aliant had arrived.  I was like cool, 5.75 for my email account right?  Nope, 300 and something in miscellaneous charges.  w00t!!! Those rotten dumbasses.  And to make matters worse, if you need help, Aliant's business hours for help are 8am to 6pm.  So if your phone is fucked any time after 6pm, you're screwed without service until the next day.  Isn't that great.  So I called internet support to see if they could tell me if I was billed for the adsl modem I had returned in April.  They couldn't tell me anything.  Just as I figured they couldn't.  So I get to work and call this morning.  37 minutes and 16 seconds of being on hold and I get the billing department.  I explain my problem and ask to know what I was billed for.  The woman's response, oh.  I can't see that information.  That comes from the credit department.  HELLO!  You billed me for this stuff and you can't tell me wtf  you billed me for?  HELLO!  Wake up!  I want service, not to be more pissed off.  So she puts in my complaint to the billing department.  So anyway, I ask how long will that take.  Your complaint will be held up due to the strike.  How long will it take?  Oh, anywhere from a month to two months to resolve this.  Ok.  Well, I'm not paying you anything.  No, you shouldn't.  We've billed so many customers for stuff that is wrong, it's sad right now.  Ok.  Well, cancel every service I have with you, which should only be an email account.  You can tell me I have an email account right?  You are billing me for it.  Yes, sir, you do have an email account and nothing else with us.  Ok.  Cancel it.  What's your email address sir, I can't see what the account name is!  It's drizzt@nbnet.nb.ca.  Oh yes, I see that right here.  This is pathetic.  I'm wavering on sending a complaint to the CRTC about this.  This is the worst service I've received from anyone.  Anyway, I have the slip to prove I returned the modem and they won't give me a number for the department I want to talk to so I can resolve this.  It better be dealt with ASAP, because I hate this crap and like to get it resolved right away.  Telephone companies, they should all be shut down we should all become telepathic.  Anyway, tune in next time, same bat time, same bat channel!
