So this morning, I brace myself, open the opinion page, and see "Iraq Illustrates Perils of Empire" by GW himself.  Say what?  Empire?  This looks interesting.  (I later find that the original title was the less, ah, biased "Ignoring History in Iraq".)   Anyway, I started reading it, and immediately encounter comparisons to early U.S. empire-building.  Annexation of the Phillipines?  Mexican-American war?  What?  Is this George Will or Howard Zinn?  At the end we even get a nod to that taboo analogy, VIETNAM!  What is a conservative in his right mind doing comparing Iraq to Vietnam?  That's our job!  And he says the other GW could lose the election over it!   Ok so that was kinda strange.  That's all.  Any idea why the date and time system on this Blogger is so godawful?  I have to correct it by hours every time, and it's off by some completely random and constantly differing amount.  Arg.
