Speaking of which, Yesterday i got to hang out with a good buddy of mine, and during our excursion we stopped by the not-so-recently moved Your Move Games in Davis Square. Lots of capitalized letters. Anyway, they have wicked cheap Magic cards there- $1 for a rare or uncommon that you pick out or $1 for randomized homemade booster packs that are guaranteed to have either a rare or "prize card" in them. The prize cards (i got one of them) are for a free extra booster or store credit. I got a free extra pack. It's a pretty sweet deal. Check 'em out. Peace.
