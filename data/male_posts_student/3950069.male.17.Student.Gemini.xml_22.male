Things went at an extremely slow pace today, but when I think of how quick another week has passed me by, its just...well I wanna slow down. I had bad mornings this week, plain afternoons and everything's like a blur -wooosh- and here I am again, waiting for the weekend and then the new week. There's just something I look forward to every time the weekend comes though, and that is the chance to be with  you.  -smiles-  Listening to songs always remind me of memories, good and bad. Maybe tonight, I'll think of my own memories. Like how it   all happened,  happiness.   I am still reminded of the time I was left all alone, so alone, by a bunch of friends whom I trusted so much in. I don't know why it happened, things just happen right? like -poof- and you're in this situation and already asking why why why? I don't want to go into details, but that was prolly the lowest point of my life. I didn't want to trust anyone else, I believed closing the door to everyone else was the way, because then no one knows anything about you and they cant  hurt  you, can they anymore? Wouldn't it be worth it if I could turn cold and turn my back on everything and everyone else if that meant I wouldn't feel hurt anymore? Boy, was I selfish back then. I hated feeling vulnerable, I don't like the way some people can look at me like I'm transparent, I didn't want to feel hurt again, but as long as we have a heart, we'll feel the pain, won't we?  Then I found  you , when everyone didn't look at me, you did. Looking back now, everything happened so fast, its been a year and five months since we got together and almost three years since the day I got to know you. You have given me wonderful memories, like the first day we met; you told me I looked nerdy but good then insisted it was Shar who said I looked nerdy and how I felt something warm but gently growing into something more than pure attraction when I looked at you. On the first day we met, we only spoke about three sentences to one another(how shyyyy) yet wasn't it amazing that I felt that I could almost tell you everything about my life the first time I asked you out? And how you caught sight of the silly picture I drew at the back of the photo of me and my dad or how you realised I drank soyabean too. I promised to give you a flower, and I got you a rose on the second time we went out together even though you weren't serious about asking me to get you a flower, but I did and its special to be the first (: Spending my first Valentine's day with you, was kinda awkward but sweet nonetheless because I surprised you by going all the way to Khatib and in the end, we talked for over 2 hours and you told me the very next day you wondered what we talked about that lasted 2 hours. If it wasn't for you, I would never know I could actually do the things i've done for you.   10th of March   2003  , that night was really amusing but meaningful. What was meant as an innocent question, turned into something that brought our hearts together (:  We have gone from confiding in one another about our lives, writing emails and letters about the people around us and our problems to sharing each other's happiness like everytime your basketball team won, I was always rooting for you. We could talk about almost everything under the sun, sharing lil late night chats under the stars, I'd be lying under the cover of my blanket on my bed, waiting for your sms and then we'd continue to talk into the wee hours of the night even though it was a school night -grins- I told you about my passion for stars and literature, I told you about my dreams, about everything I wished to be. It was amazing, how I could take all myself, how  free  I felt just being around you. From talking about music bands, we talked about our exams and how we'd always encourage one another not to give up and jia you for the next paper. And after all that, we actually thought about  our future , a future together.  Do you remember the time I placed your palm on my chest, and asked you, "do you feel it? That is my heart, and it beats for you." I took your hand and pulled you closer, "you have such beautiful eyes, I would take eternity to gaze into your eyes, if i could." -sigh- how time flies.  Wasn't I the one who told you I wanted a hug from you every night? I was there with you, when I told you I would find your faith one day, and return it to you, didn't I?  "promises are meant to be broken."-me "no! promises are not meant to be broken!"-you "whether promises are meant to be broken or not, ours is forever -smiles-"-us  The very first time you teared in my presence, I couldn't stop crying.  Those were the very first memories.  "lets just say that there's sth called moving on. just tt now it's getting to me and i wanna slow down. and i'm so scared of changing. and catching up. i fear that along the way i might just fall down and lose sth impt to me again. and i'm so scared of growing up." [-taken from del's blog]  This is just something I've been thinking of tonight.     remember, the first time I told you, "Iloveyou", didn't I look silly?        you ask me why my heart is beating so fast, I tell you, "Its because of you".      Everything sillybeautiful,  is what I call bliss.     The first time we kissed; like cherry-blossom petals, you blushed     Oh how you fell into my arms, into the depths of my soul, into my life a love I'll always cherish
