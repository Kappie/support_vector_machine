But before I explain why I find it worthy to note, there are two other things I want to say to my legion of readers.  First, Jim runs a great blog.  The kind I would love to have, but for several reasons I can't.  Partly because for me to even put up one post may take up to an hour or more, and as I work two jobs, that is time that I don't have.  And also due to the fact  that I lack original ideas.  As much as I'm interested in politics, I'm constantly amazed at how little I know.  But that's why I travel to other blogs online, giving me the opportunity to steal their ideas and present them to my peers as my own.  Jim is a skilled writer (although at times I want to sneak into his house at night and pry off that comma key), a talent that eludes me.    Secondly I really don't read newspapers very often, not even online.  While young my family subscribed to The Aegis (a third rate rag even by local county newspaper standards) and the Baltimore Sun.  My Dad ended the subscription to the Sun when the delivery guy kept tossing it into the mud instead of putting it in the box.  This happened when I was eight or so, and at the point my reading interests had yet to surpassed the comic section.  I'm really not sure what this paragraph is about or going so I'll get back to the article at hand.  I, as you might have guessed by now, live in Baltimore City.  While today's kids might call it Charm City, when I was growing up it was, and always will be to me, The City That Reads (even if it is closing library branches on a regular basis).  That means that I live in Maryland too, a state that is not considered a  urlLink swing state  .  However, upon googling, I  urlLink found  that since 1948, out of the 14 elections that were held, Maryland electoral votes went to a republican 42% of the time (6 times).  Votes went to Reagan in 1984 and his sidekick Bush Sr. in 1988.  This doesn't seem as likely now to happen as the popular vote gap between Republicans vs. Democrats has widen since 1988 to favor Democrats to a safe degree.  Hence, we are not a swing state.      That is why I voted for Nader in 2000.  I knew he would make a lousy president, but that was the beauty of it, he wasn't going to become president.  I think it's important to support a third party candidacy, giving another voice a chance in hope that the voice leads to some kind of change.  During the 2000 election I felt both candidacies, Gore and Bush, where two men trying to sell the same platform.  I didn't see a big difference between the Democratic and Republican parties.  Which frankly, I feel that in the grand scheme of things, they aren't all that different.  Both parties have sold out long ago to the highest bidders and are very good at getting very little done.   But Bush is different.  He has done things that I thought the shackles of bureaucracy would have stopped.  I know that 9/11 changed everything, primarily causing the Democrats to put their tail between their legs and form a puddle on the floor.  But I'm still amazed at what he was allowed to get away with.  And that's why I'm voting for Kerry.  Even though he has Maryland in the bag, I'm throwing my support behind him.     And I wish Nader would see this too.  He can still fight and try to change things for the better, but running for President is not the way to go.    "I'm going to take more votes away from Bush than from Kerry," he claims. Yet the overwhelming majority of polls say just the opposite. And by selecting a vice presidential candidate who will be anathema to conservatives, Mr. Nader indicated that defeating Mr. Bush is actually quite low on his list of priorities.
