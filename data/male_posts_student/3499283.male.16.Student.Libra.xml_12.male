The previous transit of Venus occurred on December 6, 1882 - one of merely five events of its kind ever watched by mankind.    ARGH I missed it!!! I'll add a pic stolen from some website to show what it would have looked like.  After school today Dan, Brandon, Meg, Angela and I went to Big Eats to study for the Wade final. From what we hear the final is a joke, just an exact combination of all 3 marking period tests, so I don't think we're quite as worried as we were a couple days ago.  Maybe Wade took pity on those who took the final early, but she better NOT HAVE!  It was hilarious.  The cook made a deal with us that whoever got the highest score on the final gets a free meal.  ITS SO ON! There goes the teamwork we planned on..  We'll be meeting tomorrow but I have my doubts on how productive it will be. It will no doubt be a lot of fun though.  Argh the heat in my room has put me in a bad mood.  The air conditioner doesnt reach my room, I don't have a fan, and even when I open my windows it does nothing.  I need some ice cream. Pity party for chad.  The only hw I have left is studying for the last Bio quiz, and I want to get to bed early....trying not to get distracted by NBA game 2...   congrats seniors-yearbooks tomorrow  Peace  Chad
