If it's over winter break, then in California. Otherwise, here in California. I'll do it over break if California folks seem at all interested.   What : We will sit down and watch six different episodes of Furi Kuri in one night, starting around 9 PM and ending around midnight. Which six episodes we watch isn't fixed yet.  Current Possibilities:  Episode 1 Episode 2 Episode 3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6  I might- might- be convinced to replace one of the six Furi Kuris with the same episode of Furi Kuri.   Why : I am a (probable) Furi Kuri major, but I have neither seen nor read all of Furi Kuri. This will not do. I suppose I could just watch the last two episodes, but that wouldn't be hardcore. And I never do anything that isn't hardcore.  So, does this sound like something people would want to do? Or at least would people want to stop by for one or two episodes?   The above post was a complete and shameless mockery of Jonathan Owiecki's "Hamletday". Well, that's not entirely true. Furi Kuri Night will happen sometime over Winter Break.
