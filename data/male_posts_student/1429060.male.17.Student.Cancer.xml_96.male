Much has happened since the last post. I lost all recreational driving privelages by not stopping completely at a stop sign about one hundred feet away from my house. Which, truthfully, sucks much. I am hardly able to go anywhere now, for I am (usually) dependent upon myself for transportation. I have slacked off in school, I am dying with fatigue, I am having less than self-preserving thoughts. Blah. School is coming to a close soon, thank god.  I am really surprised that my moodiness has not been improved by the rain recently. I usually feel splendid in rain.  Mom and Dad are attacking me for not having a job and for not being organized, which is thoroughly making me feel far worse than I think they realize. I just feel that their view of me has gone down recently, because I made *gasp* two B's on my report card and had a little encounter with the teen driving squad (police). I feel they are taking something out on me. Which is probably not true, but it sure as hell seems like it.  I really think that I am just having trouble with trust and self-image lately. I've been finding out things about friends that I wish they had told me, for example. And I can't be too sure what my fellows think about me sometimes. This, too, is probably nothing at all, and I am probably overreacting as I always do. God. I hate my neurons. I've been having this insane idea of letting all the bad blood seep out of my wrists. Or taking enough pills to make it better.  Blegh. Forgive me for being a lunatic. I am going to drink a pinapple Fanta soda. Like right now. And play Rachmoninaff whilst drinking this golden soda. Tropical Rachy.
