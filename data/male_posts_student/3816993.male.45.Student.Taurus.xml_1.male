One of the first speakers was former Vice President Al Gore. To my surprise he was actually quite funny and appeared more relaxed than usual.   During his speech he made an appeal to disaffected Republicans to consider voting across party lines. He then said something that surprised me:   urlLink  I also ask tonight for the help of those who supported a third party candidate in 2000.  I urge you to ask yourselves this question:  do you still believe that there was no difference between the candidates?    Although he never mentions Ralph Nader or the Green Party by name, the implication is obvious. I was one of those who supported a third party candidate in 2000. I have some of the same concerns about the U.S.' two party system as I had back then, but I recently found the site  urlLink Greens for Kerry . There is an interesting quote from Medea Benjamin, whom I admire, who ran for the U.S. Senate here in California. She states:   In the swing states, where this election's going to be determined, [Greens should] recognize that we owe it to the global community to get rid of George Bush. And if people in those swing states support that strategy of getting rid of George Bush, than voting for Kerry might be the strategic vote for them."   Well, I can say one thing for President Bush and his administration: it certainly has helped, sans Nader and his campaign, unite progressives and liberals in this country in a way that I haven't seen in some time.
