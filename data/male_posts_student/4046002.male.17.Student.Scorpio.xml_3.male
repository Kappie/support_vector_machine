Any guy taht watched the show will agree with me.  The second thing is that I grew up watching that show.  I mean when Cory and Topaga broke up, I was actuall upset.  And even though I seen every eposide I still laugh at the jokes.  When I watch the reruns, I try and watch them with my little brother cause he needs a show like it.  There is no new shows like that on TV now and days and that wrong.  Oh by the way Topaga is hot.
