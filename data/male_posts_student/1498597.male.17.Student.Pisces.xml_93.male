Yet this title is misleading, because the novel has nothing to do with rats, God, or rats seeing God.  In fact, the story deals with high-school senior  Steve York  who is trying to just finish his senior year in a San Diego high-school so he can obtain a diploma. There is only one problem, Steve is short in the credits department by one year of English that he failed. His counselor  Mr. Demouy  suggests that he write a 100-page story to compensate for those missing credits.  The result is a hilarious, fun-filled story based entirely upon Steve York's experiences with girls, his astronaut father, and life in general. He begins from the "bottom up" so that the reader can understand what is actually going on in the story (if that makes sense, he goes in chronological order).  Reccommended for grades 9 and up,   Rats Saw God   is a well-crafted novel that deals with the many elements of teenage life.   ---- Nick Brown   Rating:   5 eyes  out of  5 eyes.
