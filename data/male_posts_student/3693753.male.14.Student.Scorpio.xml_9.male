They think hes "on something" so they make him take the Sobriety Test and his eyes are dialated... Wiegel "Sir, your eyes are dialated, what have you been taking?" Man "Just ssome Ssskittless thatss it" Wiegel "Skittles???" (Turning to Dangle) "That must be some code name for some new drug..." (Silence) Man "So.. did you hear about the Mexican werewolves..."(Pause)"Yeah, they're coming up here and selling  crack ...."
