I'm just tired of caring about the things that don't matter or get in the way of a nice, normal, healthy situation.  Selfish as it may be, get the f*ck out of my face if you're causing me UN-needed stress.  (The key word here is UN-needed.  Bring it the f*ck on if it's productive or relevant, we'll knock it out, deal with it, solve it, etc.  Otherwise, shut your face, and back away).  *whew*  Now that I have that off of my chest, we can move on.  I saw a bearded lady today.  It was great, I was getting my tires changed in my car (because apparently if I'm going to sell the car in the next couple of weeks, the tires need to have tread, or some shit) and this HUGE lady in the tire shop had a BEARD.  This was no 5 o'clock shadow either.  She had FULL stubble.  How does such a thing happen?  I am sad that she was somehow cursed with a man-gene that caused her to grow more of a beard than I can.  *sigh* I'm sorry bearded lady, please don't be sad.  Hang in there.  Tomorrow, I take a friend to have his wisdom teeth pulled.  Poor friend.  I don't like that idea, because I know how horrible it was when I had my SIX wisdom teeth pulled.  Yes, six.  Why would anyone have six wisdom teeth?  Mason did for some odd reason and they were all up in his sinus cavities and embedded in the bones of his jaw.  I wonder why I am speaking of myself in third person.  Anyway, what a shitty week that was.  Hell, I can't complain, at least I'm not a bearded lady.  Well, it's time for me to go to bed now.  It has been a long day filled with new and exciting adventures, new people, and bearded women.  WomAn really, not womEn, seeing as how there was only one of them (I hope).    6 weeks until I graduate! WOO.  Moving to follow, so so so so so excited.  G'night ya'll.
