I listen to death metal on a regular basis, and none of that stuff, scary as it is, has put me quite off-balance as what i heard today.  What I heard today will haunt my nightmares for a long, long time.  Like the whore's manifesto I saw the other day, this was beyond the pale.  This is what prompts things like the whore's manifesto.  This song made me want to vomit, and then take a few cold showers...of flaming gasoline, to purge away the uncleanliness.  This song is called "She will be loved", by Maroon 5 ( I want to spit at any mention of that blasphemous name, but have no good place for it).    I was introduced to this song by a quote in some girl's profile.  This quote goes as so:  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved  It seemed innocent enough, so I downloaded it (illegally; this is the only reason I haven't commited Seppuku for listening to this, I didn't pay a dime) and let 'er rip.  This song was disturbing on several levels, 2 of which I will cover in this post (which you are all dying to read).  To say the least, I felt like my life had just been shortened by around 10 years.  This was disturbing on these levels:  1) Shitty music backbone This same-same, Pop-rock, trendy shit is normally stuff I don't listen to.  At least, normally, it's harmless enough.  It might give me extreme diarrhea, but it won't give me thoughts of ritual suicide to restore my wounded honor.  This was that bad.  It was everything every stereotype is, and much more.  It was so bad, so tacky, so overdone.  If this had even had decent lyrics, it would still be pretty bad.  But it didn't, oh no, and it only goes downhill from there.  2) Brainwashing lyrics And this is the real point of this article.  These lyrics are exactly why I keep fighting, even when hope fails me.  This shit is what inspires things like the travesty that was that single away message, for which I will never forget her name in my "Dear Jesus, please have ___ get hit by a bus" prayers.  These lyrics are the train wreck of the century.  If these lyrics got more of a hold on society...I don't know what would happen.  We would all become schmaltzy, sentimental communist pigs, all hailing the almighty stereotype of a lonely girl and a guy with a choice to help her.  Well, I hope you didn't put much stock in diarrhea medicine, because here comes the relief!  Aaaaaahhhhhh.  It's called "Reality check", and it's good stuff.  Nowadays, if a girl is in that position, she is baiting the trap, waiting for some poor sucker to come in and try to actually love her (you know, the thing she was looking for?) before she turns around and stabs him in the back, like is much more usual, and then resets the trap, hoping to get more idiots.  What, do you think I've never been down this road before?  It's happened more than once to me before.    Now I have to go, before my power goes out.  Now that I think about it, don't just kill a whore to help society.  Kill two!
