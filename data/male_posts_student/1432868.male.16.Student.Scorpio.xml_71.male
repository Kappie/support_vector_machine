Dunno why, just today I was talking to Dori and Kira and I wondered if they were merely tolerating me or on the verge of not tolerating me. i really wonder if I am annoying or something. well back to work. today though when making groups 4th period me Jeffrey Caitlin and Kira gerrymandered ours into a L shape. Heh Loughridge hated that. He hates our little corner rebellion he does.
