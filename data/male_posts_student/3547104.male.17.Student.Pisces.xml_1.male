(I think I've found a new pair of hos to call my own [I say that with love]). Also got my tux for SV's prom and wat not (which was yesterday)... Holler. I went with my Amy (who by the way looked like pretty pretty princess in her light blue gown)... Nikita tagged along with us because she thinks we're super cool kids (J/K). I met a few awesome kids (Holler at Autumn, Karen, Warren, Lydia, and the oh so beautiful Joe)... def woke up yesterday at ten or so and went to bed at 6:30 this god damn morning. I attended the after party at SV after the social event, where they had sumo wreslting suit things (STEPH!), inflatable twister (STEPH!), and boxing (STEPH!). Everyone also went to the auditorium to see the hypnosis (or whatever) guy do a show type thing. Quite entertaining to see a big guy think he's got ice cubes in his shorts. It was quite the night. And to Amy: You've proved white girls can dance!!   Today's lyrics are dedicated to Erin Sullivan aka My Buddy for Spring Break 05 (IRELAND!)    ...and soon we cleared the way on the rocky road to Dublin.
