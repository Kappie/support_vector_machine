I found this Calvin and Hobbes comic that seems fitting for the blog...or should i say...Club Log?      urlLink    My friend Mark T. and i went camping last night. We went to Indian Caves State Park. Nice place i must say. Ive been going there since i was a child. We drove a ways and when we got there, found a good spot to park. Then we hiked a ways to our campsite. There, we started looking for wood. Looking for wood is one of those things that's in man's blood. A man gets to a campsite and its second nature. He throws down his stuff (and at night grabs a flashlight) and heads off into the forest. There is a sense of danger going in, yes. It's a forest. But that danger is hardly ever even acknowledged. And even if it were, the next thought would be: "That would be great if something like a bear or a mountain lion decided to attack me right now, I could take the tree limb im carrying and club it to death, and bring it back home to tell of the story...maybe i will even let it claw my left arm so ill have a good scar to go with the good story." I wonder if thats the reason men sit at home after a long day of work and watch tv...They have no forest to go into to gather wood for their fire. They have no fire to build.  And so Mark and i gathered wood for about an hour. We had little head lamps strapped to our heads and every once and a while we would call out to each others glow in the distance: "finding anything good?" And so into the forest we went, pushing down small trees, jumping and pulling off large limbs, and dragging and carrying it all back to the campsite, with sweat dripping and arms burning. After a while, when we had the equivalent of 14 small trees, we went about breaking it up. For those of you that have never broke up wood, it is an art. I have learned many techniques over the years from many people. One technique i am thankful of is one i learned from Matt S. and Todd L. This technique really brings out the best in a man. It requires first, setting the limb to be broken against a tree. Then a very large limb, or log is picked up and hoisted overhead. One takes many steps back with the log balanced high in the air. Then with a full force, one runs at the limb and throws the log with all their might against it. Usually the log will snap the limb to pieces. (Occasionally, this does not work as some will attest to when camping at Yankee Hill several years ago.) Mark and i, however did not have any large enough logs to throw with so we went about our work at first by bending the limbs until they broke. The problem with this was that a lot of the wood was wet and would not break. It would bend. And bend. For about another hour this was our toil. It was successful but slow and our faces often looked like this:     urlLink    But Mark, being a genius, then rediscovered and old technique for breaking wood. This technique requires a hefty tree with a fork in it near the base. It then requires the branch to be broken, to be placed in the cleft and then torqued. And torqued. Until it breaks. This worked wonderfully for us. And we broke the rest of our wood using this ancient technique. Then we got the fire going. The fire, was good. In fact, it was grand. We stood around it throwing more and more wood into it like the fire was our bellies and they were starved. Then we sat. I noticed and commented to Mark about how once the fire was going, it felt like home. We did not want to leave. The campsite miraculously changed from nothing to our home. And it was good to sit in the forest with this grand fire, feeling at home, while coyotes chattered in the background, deer peered from the depths and owls cooed.  It was a good fire, and Mark and I had good conversation. I am thankful for that. At one point Mark told me of the army, specifically the army Rangers. He said they called campfires, "Ranger TV." Makes sense. I will confess that Mark and I didnt look at each other much while we talked, we watched Ranger TV.  The night was good as well. It was a perfect night for sleeping out. The morning was swell too, and we made another fire, ate southwestern style eggs and drank coffee. I noticed a flyer laying on the ground nearby. It was printed on Indian Caves letter head. I tore off the letterhead. I wouldent mind having my own letterhead someday looks like it. Its brilliant, but until that day...    urlLink
