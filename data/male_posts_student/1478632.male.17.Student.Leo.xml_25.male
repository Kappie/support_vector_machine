Last night I left it on to run Norton, and it found 80 infected files! Yay! So, after that happened, Norton cleverly deleted the files and my computer didnt like that for some reason. Nevertheless, it was making its funny little noises this morning for a little bit. School was funny though. Functions was dull until we went to a presentation on respect. After that presentation, with all of its flashy pictures, I felt like buying a case of Pepsi...wonder why? Chemistry was, as usual, very, very, very boring. We went on for a little bit about chemicals and then talked a little more about chemicals and then talked about some weird bridge building contest where you use popsicle sticks to build a bridge to span a 30" gap. It seems that my class is going to watch the competition for some reason...iunno why since we're a chemistry class and it's a physics project. Whatever. English was actually semi-fun today. We kept working on those stupid words that I talked about before, and I just copied off of Allison's paper today (since we were working together ;) ;) lol). We talked for a bit and then in the second part of class we talked again until Dunlea made us watch a video on Langston Hughes, which I *proudly* slept through :). History wasn't as good as yesterday. We talked about our candidates for the Final Exam project, and then we talked about Allison's  scary  story she wrote using some '20's era words that Gleason gave us (*shudders*). Afterwards, we talked about the reading from  "A Problem from Hell": America in the Age of Genocide" , at which point he just gave us some questions to answer. Monochrome and I worked with the rest of the people in our row, including Darcie, Chelsea, and a few scary girls named Michelle, Christina, Jessica, June, and the rage-fueled one: Mary. Somehow, I ended up telling everyone in the group the story of how Monochrome burned his chin on some pizza--obviously  completely  off topic, but whatever. In the end of the class, we were talking about the  best  movie evar,  urlLink Donnie Darko . Though it makes no sense at all the first time you watch it, it is major deep stuff after you've seen it twice. I  highly  recommend it to everyone who reads this page...and by every one I mean all one lol. After I got back from school, Monochrome IMed me and started talking about how he can't get Chelsea, who just doesn't seem to want a boyfriend at this point. I have to admire him, though, because he's persistent. What else has happened today? Not too much to be honest. Right now, I'm listening to the best psychadelic rock band ever: Pink Floyd, and I'm feeling a little tripped out :P. Ahh, The Wall r00ls. For today's first survey:   Your element is Earth. I hate to say it but you are down to earth. Stubborn and loyal. You tend to want to nurture others and you are the one person friends always come to for awnsers. Without people like you others would be flying over the edge because, whether you know it or not you keep a steady beat to your life and will end up where you want to in the end. There is a sureness about you that is hard to match that draws people to you. No matter what happens the Earth keeps turning.    urlLink   What's your element     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    ...and:   Miyu -- Now that you know which anime vampire you are, why don't you  urlLink  Click Here  to become one!    urlLink   If you were an anime vampire, who would you be?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     I think that's about all for this afternoon's post.  --Raine
