They were in the afternoon, so I had complete freedom to get up late, not really do anything for a few hours except nearly be persuaded to wear a shower cap to the exam (don't ask. please, for your own sanity).  The exams themselves were piss-takes. The reading was just...reading...as would be expected...and mostly consisted of writing V's and F's in boxes. So challenging...The writing only had 3 questions, the first being "Make a list of 4 different types of transport". The other 2 weren't exactly much harder either. So thats another pass.  Walking home was pretty fun. Holly kept up her 'game' with Sarah, Charli and whoever else was anywhere near, with the punching whenever they saw either a yellow car or a soft-top. Things discussed included: -Throwing ones self in front of a car. -Whether being senile always happens to everyone when they get old. -How easy the exams were, and how fast time flies. -Those new-ish 'EuroMillions' draws. -Prom transport. -Prom clothing. -Spray paint.  Again, its probably best if you don't ask. Anyways, I got a free freezepop thingo *yaay!* and found this really random thing:    urlLink Hold the Button   - How long can YOU last?
