I've realized during my time in college that I love kids. I love teaching, directing, helping guide them. Its one of the greatest feelings I've ever had....and I don't want to ever lose that feeling. So, my career is going to be geared towards children in some way, shape, or form. Law school is still a possibility, but grad school is also an option after I'm done. I'd definitely love to teach for a little while too, middle school social studies. I'm gearing up for that right now....it is so exciting to think about!      Ok enough about the stuff thatprobably noonewanted to read. I went to McFaddens for Kristina's bday on the 19th. Ran into a gang of people, such as Sabrina JT, Janet, Reg, Fred, Ty(the most surprising person I saw there), Eddie, and a bunch of others. I came there with Sam and Sarah. It was cool to hang out and all, but I'm really not feeling the whole bar/club scene anymore. I think the peak of that for me was when I was with Joey. I am definitely clubbed out. So, if you want to hang out with me sometime, invite me to a movie, bookstore/cafe, basketball game, picnic, dinner...........basically anything besides a club or bar.      This past Sunday I went down to Arlington, VA with Sam to watch Maria's game. She did exceptionally well(of course), an we went to eat afterwards. I was so happy just watching her eat. I really don't know how things happened like this, but its something out of a fairytale with this girl. Isn't love supposed to feel unreal? Definitely have that part covered, hahaha. NY is coming soon for her, and I'm sooo happy that she's so happy and excited about it. It will be tough if I'm here in MD too, but I'm built for it, and I think she is too. Anything worth having is worth struggling for! And who knows, I could also end up in NY very soon.........y'all know how I like to sporadically relocate, hahaha.      My sister is about to be a college freshman. WHERE DID THE TIME GO?!?!!?      song currently playing: Janet Jackson- Because Of Love   "Idon't care what people say   you're the one that brings me so much joy   hen I look at your smiling eyes   my heart wants to dance...."
