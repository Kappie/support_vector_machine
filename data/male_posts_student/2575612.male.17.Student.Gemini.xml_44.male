Thats how im feeling, its hard to explain. i have one hand, extreme joy for what may happen in my life in the upcoming months, and on the other : alot of regret, sadness, kind of a weakness deep inside of me? Can anyone explain, for all my readers of like three out there...But this journey of mine gets stranger and better every day. i'm so glad ive stayed away from things that could drag me down....im glad ive kept on my own less trodded path. stein auf.
