What am I going to post on this, who knows, I sure don't. It'll most likely be something that I only remember having when I'm bored . . . which is a lot.  And now for a nice and random song lyric quote from the song Baby's Got a Temper by Prodigy: "We love rohypnol, she's got rohypnol, we take rohypnol, just forget it all!!!"
