On Tuesday, I went to my Pre-employment acessment and that sumed up to be 3 1/2 hours of tests. Still waiting to hear back as far as a real interview goes.  Yesterday, I started a new painting, played Vice City most of the day and went to see Henry Rollins spoken word that evening.  I enjoyed that event. If nothing else, I was turned on to a few writers; Franz Kafka and Ryszard Kapuscinski. I am going to the used book store before work to gather up some stuff. I am so behind on good reading. I love books, and I enjoy reading immensely.  I am also on the hunt for an overhead projector. I looked a bit on ebay and the shipping is high. Maybe a thrift store will have one for me to purchase.  I've been feeling a little on the humdrum side the last couple of days. Maybe it's my exhausted excuse for not being very motivated to do everything I've been wanting to complete. I am relocating to Rohnert Park at the end of the month and I am not looking forward to the cost and labor involved. Speaking of labor, I hit the gym a few times this week. That always barrages the spirit and body. I owe the gym money, so that adds an impediment to my motivation.  So now I will try to obviate my discourse by rocking to some Stryper. That shit ALWAYS makes me laugh!
