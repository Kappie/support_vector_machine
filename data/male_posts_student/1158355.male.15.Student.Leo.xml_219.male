I withstood another day of 4th period with that retarded freshman art class where I had to make a fuckin clay panda but it didnt work so my teacher was bitching to me and if my gpa lowers because I can't build things out of clay I'll march into the school with that clay...along with a few wires (C4). Bastards. I'm so sick of school. It's almost done. The hapiness during the summer. The relaxation. The ability to go in my cousin's pool like twice a week, go to the beach, go into town, hang out with friends non-stop and play drums non-stop. I have a busy and fun schedule this summer. It's gonna kick some ass, actually no, it's gonna kick all of the ass. Not just one cheek. So ignoring the fact that I fantasized about the summer all day, this day also sucked because of seeing the American civilian decapitation FULL VIDEO (Yes the one that made front page) with those disgusting sand crawlers speaking out of their ass as they read an anti american text right before they killed him. The result, I screamed out my window "FUCK THIS WORLD" and starting attacking my mom. Well not really but I was pissed. My mom was telling me to calm down and all and I kept punching the walls and jumping up and down because seeing that really makes you wanna march into Iraq and set off a nuke because after we bomb their ass, there's no more threat but of course after this whole thing is over some other war will occur. Adults really suck, they're the ones being immature and fighting this pointless war and they tell us how to behave. So this world will never have real peace because our primitive cerebrums just cannot understand the human body yet. Maybe one day according to Karl Marx, history will stop, no events will occur and life will be the same thing over and over again. Why? Because one day after so much history, people will learn and understand the mind. Who knows. I think that's retarded but if there is one day total peace it will be set by future technology I think. Ah this is all stuff I've already explained so I'm gonna stop and just pity all of you for not being like me. Well I'm sure there's alot of peacemakers out there, not the bomb, the person. I mean most of this state is Democratic peacemakers because we're very well educated and alot of us New Yorkers are athiests including myself. The south is a different story. That's why there's war! RELIGION! Maybe it would be good if Jesus were to come right now to prove the Muslims wrong but of course Jesus isn't real so that can't happen. Well some fuckin god should show up and prove everyone's religion wrong and make everyone love each other and there'd be one religion. Anyways, I pity the people who can't keep peace, who seems to need war, to love war for some very strange reason, why? I don't understand the world at all. Maybe I should ignore it all and realize I'm going to fucking deep into this shit and I shouldn't worry because this is America, I'm safe and happy here where people are civilized. I must realize, that country is filled with beings that were once human. They aren't anymore. They used to be when they weren't filled with hate and death. Now they're aliens, disgusting scum of the earth. OK SO FORGETTING ABOUT THE WAR, I'm also mad because today I didn't have time to drum because I spent too much time playing with my record player trying to play Stairway to Heaven backwards, couldn't get it. I was playing around with it today listening to old Led Zep record such as "Houses of The Holy" and "Zoso" or whatever (Stairway To Heaven album). Fun. Now I'm clueless and can't figure out what to do. Perhaps Counter-Strike or Metal Gear Solid. Haven't played that game in a while. Or maybe just cruise the e3 on www.nintendo.com for more awesome new games. Goldeneye 2?! Awesome.
