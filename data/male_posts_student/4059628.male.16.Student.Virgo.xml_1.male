I also make myself busy with a lot of things....especially academics, which for me, places a high value in my agenda. But wait! I'm not the type of a nerdy=nerdy=geeky person as you may thought. Of course,there's a little bit of time to satisfy my hunger......Eating! and Debating with some other guys....especially Paulo, my worst enemy (in argumentation!) and another Paolo, our soon to be Summa Cum Laude.  My life, I should say, is nothing more a bit exciting. For me, life is just a state where you can experience the extremes in your life. Yeah, for sure it's a little bit mushy but let's accept the fact that life's like this. No one knows, I may become the future CEO of Globe Telecommunications Company or in another perspective, I may become just a little, scrawny boy you can see in the middle of the street waiting for jeepney drivers to buy my cigarettes and pungent menthol candies.(Haler!)  Okay, let me stop myself blubbering around here. I am making no sense at all! But anyway, just to make you a bit excited, I will get this end for the moment. Wait for further postings and announcements about myself and my interpersonal daily activities......Chiao!
