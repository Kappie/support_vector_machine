She came into town Friday night and I got to see her right after work. However, I ended up hanging out with my mom and then my dad that night. Megan had a "date" with Kyle as I put it. He cooked her dinner and then they watched a movie together. I knew that she was doing this and I have no say in what she does anymore so I can just bare it. I also couldn't sleep last night. I didn't get to sleep until like four in the morning. Not being able to sleep is a common thing for me actually. I have never been able to sleep very well at all. It usually takes me two to three hours to fall asleep each and every night.  So you might be wondering why I can't sleep and what do I think about. Well the answer is is that I think about a lot of things that are bothering me and how maybe things could have been or could be different. For example, last night I thought about Megan and everything that was going on. I thought about how I really do care for her and that part of me can't bare the thought of losing her. I also thought about other girls I have liked over the years I have dated Megan.   OK....OK I will finally admit it to myself and everyone else
