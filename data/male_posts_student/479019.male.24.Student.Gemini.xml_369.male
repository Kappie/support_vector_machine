Even the cameos by Andy Dick and David Spade were whatever. I can't say there were any gags that really stood out even.   I have  American Psycho  sitting on my dresser, which I'll watch tomorrow. I think that should be much better than the trite movies I've been watching lately... well no  Trainspotting  wasn't. I should probably check my NetFlix queue. Heh... queue... I remember hearing that word in England in the first time under the English context of standing in line. One of the reason's why I rented  Loser  is because that Wheatus song was kind of big in England, when I was there seemingly ages ago.   I've actually been thinking a lot about England due to my art history class. It's weird, yet so cool to learn about places I've actually been. I reminds me of that awesome summer... and I'm looking forward to the upcoming summer. I miss my friends, concerts, and California.  ***
