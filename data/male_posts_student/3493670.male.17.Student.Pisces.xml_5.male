Because he makes me cry. I've got to make him happy. I've got to teach him how to fly. I want to take him higher. Way up like a bird in the sky. I want to calm him down now. I want to save his life.  And I know that Love will change us forever. And I know that Love will keep us together. And I know, I know, there is nothing to fear. And I know that Love will take us away from here.  Sometimes its such a pleasure. Sometimes I wanna tear it all down. Its easy to be lazy. And hard to go away from the crowd.  I know the road looks lonely. But that's just Satan's game. And either way my baby. Will never be the same.  And I know that Love will change us forever. And I know that Love will keep us together. And I know, I know , there is nothing to fear. And I know that Love will take us away from here.  In a blink of an eye everything could change. Say hello to your life, now you're living. This is it. From now on, its a brand new day. It was time to wake up from this dream [from this dream].  I know the road looks lonely. But that's just Satan's game. And either way my baby. Will never be the same.  And I know [And I know] that love [that love] will change us forever And I know [And I know] that love [that love] Will keep [that love] us together [that love]  And I know [And I know] that love [that love] will change us forever And I know [And I know] that love [that love] will keep us together And I know [And I know], I know [I know] there is nothing to fear And I know [And I know] that love [that love] will take us away from here
