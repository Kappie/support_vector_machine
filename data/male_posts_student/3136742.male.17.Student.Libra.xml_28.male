I shouldn't have to stack my dessert plate on my mug of milk just so I can shut a door behind me... What is this bullshit?! No, I'm done with this shit-- I've had it! We humans have lots of organs which served a purpose at one distant point in time but have since become useless-- excess bagage. I'm talking about apendixes (that is an acceptable spelling of the word, before you bitch at me), tail bones, pinky toes, toe nails, uvulae (do we really need a gag reflex? c'mon.), that little fucking concave bump under the septums of our noses, wisdom teeth, etc... We don't need that junk. What's the point of it all? There is none. The human body is such an inefficient machine, and why should all that bone and tissue go to waste on all of those bullshit organs and apendages? Starting now, I am  willing  myself to grow another arm, or another pair of arms. That would be something I could use. You could brush your teeth and comb your hair at the same time, or even wipe your ass without interupting your magazine reading. Imagine all those times when you thought to yourself "Self, you could really use a hand with this." Or think about the potential for musical success. Hell, I'm sure it would make sex a whole lot more interesting.  This might take a while, but I'm sure if I meditate on the idea long enough I'll develop some sort of useful apendage.
