I thought it would be boring but I actually got into the story, although some parts of it were confusing.  The people in our discussion group were having a hard time trying to figure out Dr. T.J. Eckleberg.  Does he represent God?  Nick?  Or just a random billboard, watching everything?  Anyone have any ideas?  Also, we had a group consensus that we dislike Tom and Mrs. Wilson (well, mostly a consensus).  I have to go, but I'll come back later! Bye
