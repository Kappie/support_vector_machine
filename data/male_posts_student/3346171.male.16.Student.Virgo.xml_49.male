Did i mention about an aunt who had a problem on her thumb, and the blood didn't come back to her heart, so the thumb got necrozed? Well, she was under a cirurgy and everything was fine, the doctor had to vut only the thumb off, if it bled, they'd have to cut off until the ewbol. Thank God!!!!!!!  I can't post anymore, because i went to the gym and didn't take shower. Ew! I know!!
