Jo's dad is a dude, and his party was cool. Had a pint of bitter and a tropical Bacardi so I was hardly barely altered but I had some interesting conversations with Shez and Seg about alternative uses for vegetables and the like. Oh, we played well too *shrugs*. I wandered off in the middle of 'Are You Gunna be my Girl?' though, so... um... what? It's showmanship. Yeah.  After catching the train back to Cheltenham my mum decided she was going to come and pick me up from town and so I lay on a bench for a while and people thought I was a hobo. Todd walked past and I did the rising thing and scared him. Talked to him for a bit. Todd's cool. But yeah, mum didn't turn up so I had to phone her and make her take me to Gloucester. Then I went to Ross... basically I hadn't been back home for 2 days. Whoopdeedoo.  Saw Meg and Ainsley at the GYWO rehearsal, even though they didn't actually turn up for the rehearsal, just the meeting afterwards. Meg's off to Sri Lanka for a couple of weeks so I'm not gunna see her for a bit. Should be someone I can talk to lots in Holland, which is cool, cause she's nice and fun. Hooray.  Had day 1 of the 6th form induction today. Meh, the guy taking it was cool enough but he didn't say a lot for the amount he said. You know.... he spent 3 hours saying about 5 minutes worth of material, that sort of thing.  *sighs* It was pretty good on events. It's me thinking that's made it worse. Think I might just be over-tired at the moment.  Quote of the day: "I'd follow you To the end of the earth, If you would follow me."  From   My Own   Love, Jon Roskilly
