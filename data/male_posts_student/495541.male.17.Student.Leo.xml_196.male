I'd like to upgrade to BLOGGER PRO but I don't have money to at the moment.  Well I'm in the process of a complete redesign of my page.  I have no ideas at the moment but we'll see.  I'm interested in making a section for photos and videos and maybe some other interesting sections based on the things that occur when you're bored out of your mind during the summer.  I'd like to get out the video camera and take some video if I could.  We'll see how quickly I get a new design up.
