Well its not really backstabbin cuz im over that now...i have moved on to something even better, and im happy now...i am forgettin about and droppin the past, it has gone and will forever b gone, im looking towardz what i have right now...i have been through the bad and i dont want that to happen again, its over. I hope something does happen between me and that special girl i have started to talk to, she has a great personality and we both like the same thingz and have the same traits...its great jus talkin to her and gettin to know her and for her to get to know me...its a beautiful thang...PAYCE!!!
