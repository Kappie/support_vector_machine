I understand perhaps is because of the incident which happened yesterday, that has caused the auntie to be emotionless. I then came up with this theory, when someone is feeling down, the food they cooked will be awful to eat. That means their cooking skill will be greatly affected.  Even though having chilli added makes no difference to the Mee Soto... or is it my tastebud.  I can't tell what had exactly happened, I heard it, I felt it, but I couldn't tell how terrifying it was.  Something was already amiss in the past, it was not right, I should have knew it... but all is already too late. It can never be undone nor it can be forgotten, forgiveness it might be but unlikely.  Things are not going to be the same again, it can never go back to the past. Everything has changed from time to time, but the history will always remain. Nobody knows what will happen next, one thing for sure, anything can happen just in a second. It's just a matter of time, sooner or later everyone will know. What seems untrue can become a fact and a fact can never be changed to a tale.  It's the reality that controls our fate, not the virtual. Think before you regret, because you will never know the future that lies ahead beyond us...
