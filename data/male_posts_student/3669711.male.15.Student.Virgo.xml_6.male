Since my job offer didn't come through for today, i was forced to play CS for the entire morning.  I started off sucking, like normal.  Then i started to get a bit better.  I was about 9 for 14.  Pretty good.  Next game 10 for 12.  Next game 14 for 15.   Next game 17 for 12.  W00t!  I'm starting to get back my m4d sk1llz!!  Next thing you know, i'll be as much of a CS junkie as i am a DoD junkie.  Damn these Half-life mods and their addictability...  Lates
