I decided I'd better post today though, since I'm probably not going to get to post Monday, Tuesday,  or Wednesday. In fact, I almost think I'm a little too tired now.  Yesterday me and my dad went over to his parents farm; what we consider the middle of nowhere. About the middle of the day we went fishing. As it turned out I caught 6 catfish and my dad caught only 1 =-) (Yes, that's the truth).  He probably would have caught more, and me included, but it started to rain on us. So.... we had to go in.   All in all we had pretty much more than enough, but it would have been better to have more than 2 days worth of fish. And that's saying we gave some to my grandparents. Today however was pretty (is pretty) much normal. Not much goes on on Sundays to talk about, but I guess then again not much goes on during the summer when you are around me. I am a pretty boring person. Well. Off I go. Later.
