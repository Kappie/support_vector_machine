Tonight was "Thursday Thunder" at the local strip, and it was nothing but street legal rides.  I loved it.  We pulled up to the ticket stand and the guy asked us if we were racing tonight.  As it turned out, ANY street legal car could race for $10.  There were Mustangs, Camaros, Firebirds, Foci (more than one Ford Focus), a couple Imprezas, a Celica or two, some Corvette ZO6s, an Evo, a Dodge Challenger, a Yamaha Warrior, a Suzuki motorcycle (that ran the 1/8th mile in 7.2 seconds at 109 mph), and many others (including a Dodge Shadow, some Chevy S-10s, and a Scion xB...which sucked.)        One of the coolest was simply called the "Grocery Getter." It was an 80s model station wagon that burned every other car there.  It ran the 1/8th somewhere in the 8s at 92 mph.  No V8 or turbo/nitrous equiped car could touch it.  It was pretty funny.      Then, they had a jet dragster there.  This thing was amazing.  It ran the 1/8th in 3.6 sec at 207 mph.  The driver was a 21 year old female.  Now, girls are awesome...and racing is awesome...but a girl that goes over 300 mph in a quarter mile is wicked.      School starts in a week...and I am still "car-less."  I'm really starting to worry, as I do not want to ride the bus again if I can help it.  I thought I had one, though.  There was a nice 1998 Dodge Neon Highline Sport (That could probably contend with some of the rides at the strip), but it was sold before we could buy it.  I'm going to keep looking, but I'm biting my fingernails now...      I got Alter Bridge's new album "One Day Remains."  Those guys are great, much better than Creed, in my opinion.  I'm glad they dropped Stapp's ass and decided to let their heavier side come out.  Good decesion, guys.      Well, I think that's enough for now.  I'll try not to go another 9 days without posting.  Talk to you later.
