Id just like to say that My Little Eye is freaky. With horror movie I get to terrified pretty quickly but it takes a lot to get me to fucking terrified and this movie failed. I mean it was scary and it was scarier than the ring but I mean its still a movie maybe its just that Im reflecting it was pretty gross in the cinema. The acting wasnt bad if a bit over done. The cinematography was interesting but it had to be. It had a sock rocking ending though. All in all it was like a good Identity. Actually now that I say that its pretty damn similar to identity except without the subplot. Though a subplot could have made the movie more interesting.  Im thinking about taking up a sport to get fit and make my body better. Vi dunno what sport I have a few floating around in my head. Im not sure I want something that I can do by myself so I dont have to be a team player, I hate relying on other people I guess Im just not trusting.  I also had a brief look at some cars today and here the shock the mini had the most leg room out of all th cars I looked at including an astra and a Peugeot 206. the mini had the nicest interior with a kinky CD player. The back seats looked like theyd be shit for sex though the seatbelts stuck right up. But I suppose the car is sexy not used for sex, lol. Oh well it was THAT much better than all of the other cars, and it has like 6 airbaags so its good for safety.  1up shroom to: Tiffany who is ingrids friend whos pretty cool and smart  Poisoned Shroom to: australian for society, why does everything have to close so late?
