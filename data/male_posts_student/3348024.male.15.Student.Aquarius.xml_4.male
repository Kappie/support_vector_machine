The good guy does something completely unrelated to the story to show his character.  He then goes to talk to his boss who gives him the important mission that is going to take two hours to complete compared to the 7 minutes it took to complete the opening mission.(sounding like James Bond to any of you?).  Aparrently they didnt' even want to create any original characters either.  They just took some comic book/video game characters and put them in the generic storyline with some flashy graphics(to impress the youngins.) and dialogue full of cliches.  The whole damn movie was a cliche.  Sooo... in general, Van Helsing sucked.
