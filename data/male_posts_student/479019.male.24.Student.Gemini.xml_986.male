There wasn't enough parking both in and out of the fairgrounds, and the lack of adequate notification that good bands like  urlLink Anti-Flag , and the  urlLink Bouncing Souls  were "opening" was bad.  Anyway, I got into the venue and immediately felt like it was going to be a let down, but  urlLink Guttermouth 's mocking of the Casualties' fans lifted my spirits. See what happened was Guttermouth came on right after the Casualities and they made a joke about the Casualities' hair and time telling abilities. Then the fans got pissed off at Guttermouth. The lead singer Mark then proceded to rip on the fans through out the set. He'd be all like, "Where's my leather jacket?" "This is nothing but a fashion show!" "The Sex Pistols invented this thing called the swindle in which they make money off you... just like how you spent $$$ on hair products, make up, and women's clothes." That of course resulted in lots of trash being tossed at them. It was funny and reminds me of some past  urlLink comments I've made on some of those kids.  Then it was a fun  urlLink Bad Religion  set, an actually good NOFX set, the amazingly funny antics of  urlLink Van Stone , and Flogging Molly. Seeing 7 bands ain't bad.  ****
