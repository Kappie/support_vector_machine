The first one was  Harry Potter and the philosofers stone , wich had some really nice extra's, I especially liked the deleted scenes wich you were able to see if you reached the stone. It was interesting to see some things that were mentioned in the book, but not in the film. Other things that you could see were tours on Hogwarts, buying a wand, catching the snitch, etc...  The second one was  The meaning of life , a film by Monty Python. I really love these people, because the make great Britisch humour and the extra's on this DVD were just like how you would expect them: bizarre, and most of the time hilarious! You can see how the film was cleaned up, how it was promoted, how it was made, etc...  Third and last one was  The Quest for the holy grail , also by Monty Python. You can see a scene from the movie made in Lego (fantastic!), karaoke versions of the songs, the many uses of coconuts, how to be a good monk ( Pie Lesu Domine, Dona Eis Requiem ), and a very interesting documentary about the locations used in the film, where you can see how it is possible to use one castle more than one times for more than one locations, discover stairs that aren't stares, corridors that aren't corridors, etc...  Think that was it, so goodbye, and don't forget to smile when the brother of the baker's nephew's mother in law's aunty's doctor's girlfriend passes by!
