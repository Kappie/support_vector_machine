(for the second time actually. kinda lost my first ones with the rest of my wallet.) and the ohio state government has slipped up again by letting me get my driver's license. suckers. all of this is on the condition i pass the test tomorrow but i don't expect any trouble. keep small children and animals off the sidewalks, let alone the streets. this emancipation has been long awaited and i'm going to revel in it's glory.   as you can see i've had a rough past couple days so i think i'm going to recuperate from all the trauma... Skool fo Foolz!
