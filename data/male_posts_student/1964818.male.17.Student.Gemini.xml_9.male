Only things to do are look for tokens, do the insanely hard challenges and do the random crimes.  I just wanna get Tales of Symphonia right now...  I saw the Spiderman movie on Saturday, and it was really good.  There was enough difference from the game so that I didn't know everything that was going to happen.  Now I cant wait for the third one.  later...
