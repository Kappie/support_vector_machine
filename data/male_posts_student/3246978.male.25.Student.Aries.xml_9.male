These employees will either be on the rolls of Reliance industries/ Reliance Infocomm/ Reliance Energy itself or smaller little known group companies.  I believe Reliance is stretching its strategy of SELF - RELIANCE too far. First it would be a major Human Resource excersise and secondly it may look like a Public Sector Enterprise.Soon time will come whenexcess labour force (or unproductive labour force) would become a heavy baggage for the Reliance growth machine.  It would also lead to diluation of brand value of Reliance as a recruiter. Similar problem is being faced by IBMs and Morgan Stanleys of the world who are recruiting people for call centers under the flagship company Brand name in India.  Its time Reliance starts the unlearning process. SELF-RELIANCE has worked for them in past and is one of the major reason for their success. But retail business is a different ball game. Its time to learn the virtues of OUT-SOURCING
