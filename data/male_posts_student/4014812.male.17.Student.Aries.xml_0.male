Then ashley phoned me and threatned me to goto a movie.. but i didnt want to cuz i didnt have a ride home... and i really didnt wanna take a taxi because they are really expensive and i dont exactly have alot of money to use this weekend so i must use sparingly...     Yeah.. me, Wes and James played Warcraft for like 2 hours straight... until about this point where im typing up this thingy... yeah.. we were playing this Diablo RPG thing and the players were being gay and using stupid moves, but i dont think you wanna hear about that.     yeah.. going downtown tomorrow apparently but i dunno what for.. or when.. cuz wes never gives complete instructions... DAMN YOU WES... YOU N YOUR GENGER BREAD MAN... hahaha Wes cant spell..
