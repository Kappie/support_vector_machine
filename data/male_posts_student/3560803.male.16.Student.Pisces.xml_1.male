So anyway, I woke up about 9:00 and groaned a bit.  Not so much because of the time, but because I have felt like shit since yesterday.  For those of you who know what I'm talking about, I don't blame her and she was justified in her decision I suppose, but it still hurt quite a lot.  It's like one of those feelings where your heart is being squeezed so that all emotion leaves it.  Why would all emotion leave someone’s heart?  I'll tell you.  It's because that person is feeling extreme pain (the squeezing) and they eventually go numb (loss of emotion).  I think I'm doing better with it now.  It not so much anger and I'm just questioning myself now.  Why not me?  What did I do wrong?  Will I ever get what I want and feel that I deserve?  I haven't figured out the answers to these questions yet, but it will give me something to do during the summer.  So back to my day.  I fell back asleep after I woke up at 9:00 and reawakened at about 10:30.  Feeling that I should stop being pathetic and lazy, I got up and went downstairs.  After sloshing around for a bit, I sat down and watched The Rundown with my Dad and brothers.  I was so into the movie, however, that I didn't talk to them much.  Fortunately, I had some leftover ribs as company.  They didn't stick around long, but it's good to just sit around in your boxers and eat every once in awhile.  Did I mention that I love food?  Thank goodness I have a high metabolism or I'd be fat and undesirable.  That doesn't really matter though because my experience with women has taught me that I am, in fact, undesirable.  That wont ruin my time though.  It will just make it lonely.  So around 1:00, I got in the shower and made myself presentable to go to A.J's.  I know that sounds gay, but it isn't meant to be.  You see, there was an extra credit project for my chemistry class where we had to take a well known song and change the lyrics so that it was chemistry orientated.  We then would have to either record it or perform it for the entire class.  I'll post the lyrics to my song at the bottom of the entry.  The plan was for Dan, A.J. and I to make this music video at A.J's house.  This didn't happen though.  When we got there we were so unmotivated that we dismissed the idea and decided to eat instead.  Conveniently, one of A.J's older sister's was having a graduation party and there was plenty of food for us to eat.  Another plus about the party was that there was lots of women there.  There was only two problems with that.  Number one is that the girls ranged from about thirteen to sixteen.  You wouldn't think that's a problem, but we couldn't tell the ages of the girls.  They all looked the same age so I decided to leave well enough alone.  The second reason is that there’s a girl who I really like a lot and I can't even think of going out with someone else because I'm pretty much in love with her.  I know that sounds really pathetic, but I can't help it.  Anyway, since the flirting idea was out the window, we decided to just go to A.J's room and hang out.  While we were down there I got to play a Star Wars game which wasn't too exciting and I watched A.J's kick some Communist Russia ass with a wrench.  It was quite amusing.  Then I got an angry call from my mother where she told me to be home at 6:00 and yelled at me because the answering machine for my new cell phone says "mwa haha bitches!"  That reminds me, I should change that.  So at 6:00, I left A.J's and went home.  I took the long way of course because I hate being at my house.  When I got home, I put the bike away because I can't drive yet.  Then I came up to my safe haven, my room.  Then I started this site and am currently talking to Meg and Bailey so I'm going to write later.
