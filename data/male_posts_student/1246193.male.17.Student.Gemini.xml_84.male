School is out, the weather is beautiful, and the ice-cream truck is up and running. You can't get much more summery than that. It has been a long year and I am completely ready for summer, because it means LOTS of FUN!  On a slightly less positive note, time is passing faster than I want it to. I think that everyone is coming to the realization that next year is our last in high school. It is really rather scary. I know that people say that they can't wait to get out of high school, but I think I could stand another couple of years. I don't deal well with change. I can't imagine what the seniors are going through, a combination of incredible joy and incredible fear perhaps? Bethany really needs to get that time machine/energy converter thing built. Or maybe I will just go to space. Though, I will probably just deal with the changes as they come.  Men do change, adn change comes like a little wind that ruffles the curtains at dawn, and it comes like the stealthy perfume of wildflowers hidden in the grass--John Steinbeck
