We played outside with this long table cloth jumping through it and going under this gigantic construction cone and when cars come I'd walk across the street but all they saw is a moving cone. And perhaps a few feet. That's right bet you didn't see that one comin, I'm a real life pokemon. Then I was completely wrapped in table cloth and I looked like one of Osama's ladies. Very grand. We watched some Three Stooges, then everyone left. Today, I don't remember, nothing good, fell asleep I think 4 times in school today and then I got home and passed out. Didn't get to practice my drums today but I will all day tomorrow along with lessons. Ok bye.
