We opened Legend of Jenny Wiley last night to a huge house.  And it was very well received.  My first paid lighting design looks amazing... even I'm impressed with myself, and people have been fairly encouraging.  One person commented that it is the best the show has ever looked. I'm very proud of that design.  Well, it's not much of a post... but it's the 400th... isn't that swell?  Keep checkin' in... who knows... maybe there'll be 400 more.
