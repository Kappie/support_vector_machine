Well, actually,  more  about me. I've been thinking--yes, I know, very shocking. I guess the major question in my life right now is: "  urlLink  Mary    or   urlLink  Theresa   ?" Do I continue in this endless quest for Mary?--who seems to have grown quite fond of me now that I speak less and less to her. Or do I move on and try for someone else--namely, Miss Theresa.       On the one hand (the Mary one), I truly am in love with Mary. I mean, I can talk about her like I hate her and say cruel things about her, since it's the summer and I rarely see her--but what happens when school's back in session? I can't possibly contiue pretending she doesn't mean anything to me if I'm confronted with her stupid face every day, can I? She's only the second person I've really loved, and letting go of that seems out of the question. But I've been trying preposterously hard to get her to love me back, and that has proven to be fruitless. It's been five months since we've stopped dating--I should have moved on from her by now. And I believe the only way I can move on from her is to literally  move on  to another person. Which brings me to my next point...      Theresa. Okay, so, maybe I'm not in love with her; maybe she has a boyfriend; maybe she's a seventh grader-- so?  I was watching  The Dreamers  (amazingly beautiful movie, by the way) today, and those French bastards don't care about any of that shit. Hell, they spoon with members of their own  family . Do you think age and relationship status gets in the way of a Frenchman's libidinous desires? Hell no! Just because I grew up in this Puritan-founded bastard of a country doesn't mean I have to bow down to its wholesome, pristine beliefs. And it's not like I just want to have some sexual affair with her--I  really  like this girl. I think she's smart, funny, kind--not to mention, dazzlingly gorgeous. But do I have a chance with her? Well, I'd like to think so. I guess I should probably learn more about her and the relationship she has with her boyfriend before I make my move.       So I guess I just have to just ask myself who I want more.       Who do I want more?       ...       Well, I can't answer that. Maybe if someone else asks me.       ...       I  said , "Maybe if someone else asks me."       ...     urlLink  G-D    [  urlLink  blog    ] : OH, WAIT, YOU MEAN ME?        No, I mean that other extension of my personality who answers all of my queries.        G-D: THERE'S ANOTHER ONE?        Yes  you , you ass.        G-D: UH...WHAT DID YOU WANT?        Just...Just nevermind.        G-D: NO, WAIT--I GOT IT.  AHEM . WHO DO YOU WANT MORE, MY SON?        ...       No, that didn't work either.        G-D: WELL THEN STOP BOTHERING ME, DICKWAD. I HAVE SERIOUS BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO.        Like what? You haven't done anything useful in years.        G-D: WELL, I, UH...I HAVE A BLOG NOW,  THANKYOUVERYMUCH .        Oh, yeah, you gotta keep cranking out those entries for all your faithful readers. Fag.        G-D: {SMITES -chuck-}           -chuck-    ...or eat limes...
