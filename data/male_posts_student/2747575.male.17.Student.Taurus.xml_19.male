No matter how much you trust me, either me or Will (and I am hoping it will be me) will call her tomorrow. I am promising you this time.  Other then that, it is really cold outside right now in Toronto. I just walked my dog and I am freezing, and my hands are numb, so this post will remain short. Period.
