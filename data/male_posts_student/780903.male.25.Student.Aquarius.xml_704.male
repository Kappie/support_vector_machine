Anyway, the soundtrack, which, if you want to pay $2.50 less than I did at Tower Records, but pay for shipping instead and wait a bunch of days to get it, can be found on Amazon  urlLink here .    I give the soundtrack 3 stars out of 4, on a random scale I'm just inventing right now that means nothing.  The songs are nicely melodic for current Broadway -- actually hummable in a bunch of cases, which is nice.  Most are uptempo trying to be funny, and some even succeed.  In a bunch of cases, the titles / concepts are pretty funny and executed nicely -- "Everyone's A Little Bit Racist," "Schadenfreude," "I Wish I Could Go Back To College" -- and in bunch of cases the titles / concepts are pretty funny but it's one joke and executed predictably without much oomph -- "The Internet Is For Porn," "I'm Not Wearing Underwear Today," "You Can Be As Loud As The Hell You Want (When You're Makin' Love)," "My Girlfriend, Who Lives In Canada."  The rest of the songs are a mix of not-that-funny plot filler ("The Money Song"), and pretty solid ballads / "meaning" songs ("There's A Fine, Fine Line," "Purpose," "Mix Tape").  My favorite song on the CD is possibly "What Do You Do With a B.A. in English," except it's too short, and so it probably means they ran out of funny stuff to say.  So I like overall.  Recommended if after reading enough of my weblog you think that if I like something you probably will too.  :)
