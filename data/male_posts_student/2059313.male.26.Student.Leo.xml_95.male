One instance of forgetting is that of a friend who becomes involved with someone and suddenly they don't have a lot of time for their friend.  I've witnessed this more times than I can count, and I've experienced it more times than that.  It's hurtful.  It makes you feel unimportant in others lives.  God, if this is a lesson, I think You've taught me well. Please don't allow me to put any of my friends through this if I meet someone.  I want to incorporate that person into my life, not neglect my life for that person.  I want to add on to my life, not replace it. Forgive me if I've hurt others in this way, and please grant me peace in this area.
