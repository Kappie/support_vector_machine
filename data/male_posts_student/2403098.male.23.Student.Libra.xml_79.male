I have no recolection (memory of a goldfish tonight for some reason) what the joke was, but it had something to do with us both wishing that "Aunt Becky" off Full House had a website called "BeckyAgainstTheWorld.com"  Lauren dared me to just go ahead and change my blogspot title to "Becky Against the World" so there it is.  I might just leave it forever.  On another happy note, I did update my "about me" page, just with some worthless crap.  enjoy!
