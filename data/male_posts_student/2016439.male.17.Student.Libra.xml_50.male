I'm seriously starting to get nervous about going to Reno tomorrow and competing with five other  highly qualified  individuals for a spot that only recently has become of utmost importance to me.  I've been on an emotional rollercoaster this week: at one point I'm thrilled about going, the next I want it to be over.  One minute I think I have a very good shot at being National Young Marine of the Year, the next I think I have none.  I really don't know what to expect.  I don't even know what I'm doing; I feel like I'm playing pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey.  But whatever.  Surprisingly, I'm not nervous about flying tomorrow.  Usually I start freaking out about two weeks before because I hate to fly; it's one of my biggest fears.  However, I'm not feeling the hysteria that normally accompanies a flight.  I guess it's because I'll be flying with my parents and grandmother instead of by myself like I was last summer when I flew multiple times.  Reno, NV, should be cool.  We won't get to see much of it, but that's okay with me.  Saturday's going to be what I think one of the most stressful days of my life thus far.  We have the oral board where the Young Marine Board of Directors basically grill you on whatever they want (personal info, YM knowledge, whatever they want) as well as the banquet.  The banquet is where they announce the winner, and start from sixth place and go up.  I absolutely  detest  when they announce results like that.  It makes me feel lightheaded and seasick (yes, seasick).  Grrr...  Well, we'll see how this goes.  I suppose this is the pinnacle of my career as a Young Marine.  I graduate from the program in a year, so I have to make this last one my best.  Guess we'll have to see what this next year holds.  As stressful as it can be, I can't wait.  Looking forward to the future is one of my favorite pasttimes ;-)
