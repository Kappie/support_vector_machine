Was so over joyed you know. Cause I got second in class with an A1!!! I was so happy when Mr Khoo gave me my paper. Was like totally crazy!!! Kept asking people their marks, but quite mean la. hehe... Then, Ms Sheka( if that's how you spell it ), kept telling us about her date later in the evening during make-up. So funny, she a bit too transparent. Wonder if she notices.  Then, I came home practiced piano...try to la...then slack around. Now I found out that my broadband bill had exceeded and I'll be in for scolding. Don't think my achievements in results will matter anymore...haiz...God, give me joy and peace.
