This year’s suck; advertisements, coupons for Campbell’s Chunky Chili, Chicken Ramen Noodles, Clearasil Lotion, and Nyquil and Dayquil (add tampons for the female version). No deodorant, no candy. And the exterior of each box is a big Sponge Bob…oh, and there are condoms in each one. I don’t know why they would put rubbers in a box with a child’s cartoon character on it (people usually take those things home to their kids thinking there’s nothing but candy in them). Now I’ve got 150+ condoms and nothing to do with them. Whenever my brother is home he is sleeping. He’ll nap all day up until dinner, then go to sleep at 8:30. By that time I’m usually tired of being on the computer and I want to do something. My only two options are go out or play my bass/guitars. Working at the bookstore only pays once every third Monday, so I don’t have money to spend. Going out is useless (plus I don’t have a destination, since most places close at 9 on weekdays), and my room is right next to his, so I can’t play music. Is it my brother’s fault that every weekday of mine is ruined? You might have heard that hell froze over. I might be getting a cell phone soon, just to have around. NP: Victor Wooten – his cover of The Beatles Norwegian Wood (one of the most impressive instrumentals I’ve ever heard).
