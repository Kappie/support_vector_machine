So, I get to see her again however, I just keep feeling that something is not right and I don't know what is it! May be is just a feeling or....... never mind! Feeling very sad now and I also don't know why?! What the hell is wrong with me? I am feel like dying now just end my life and I won't feel so painful! Haiz.. But I guess that she don't know how much I love her! When will she know? Holy sh*t! Just want to die now! what's the fastest way to die without pain and looking good? Haiz..
