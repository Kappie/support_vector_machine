I guessed the ending 1/4th of the way through the film, though. "I think I know where this is going, but I don't know how the monsters play in here." ... "oooohhhhhhh. I get it."  Chapter one: The basic rules of love.  The first rule of love is that it doesn't make sense. The second is that as soon as you write down a rule for it, it breaks the rule, so by writing this everything written here is totally true. Except for rule two which is actually false. Because it is a written rule about love. SO that means rule one is...  Oh. Nevermind. ...it's late...  Now I feel like one of those annoying people that won't leave you alone and won't get a clue but your too nice to say, "go away" But I hope it was just that she was tired. Yeah. Tired. That's it.  The hunt is on. We're finding Katy a boyfriend. So watch out all you eligible sexy male specimens out there, here....we.....COME!!! *busts into the mall with a tranquilizer gun - commando style*  and I wanted this post to be good
