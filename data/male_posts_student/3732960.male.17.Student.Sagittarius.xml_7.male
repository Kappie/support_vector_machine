When i woke up and got ready, we headed to summerfest. we'd panned on seeing switchfoot. then we decided to keep our options open, cuz we'd both heard "meant to live" 100000 times on the radio, so we were debating between switchfoot, dashboard confessional, and trapt. What did we end up seeing??? NONE OF THEM! We just walked around the whole time. I saw some cool people. Brie, Heikinnen, Menghe, Christina and Sidlarz, Britney, Dan, Chiello, Hannah, and my friend jessica, so that was cool. But the plan was to meet up with some of my other friends and get shit-faced. turns out they decided to leave their cell phone at home, and i didnt find 'em all night. Then we got to the car to go home and got stuck in the parking structure for about 45 minutes, and there were stupid people who kept laying on the horn cuz there was a huge ass traffic jam and it just started to give me a headache, but when their stupidness died down, i was fine. Then me and kathy decided to say fuck you to the huge traffic jam getting on the freeway, and we went the other way.... only problem: we didnt know how to get home that way. Yea Turns out, kathy's a spectacular driver and navigated her way from there to the freeway and we got home around 1:15ish. I made myself a drink (which i'd wanted to do all night) and then kathy decided she should go, cuz she had to work this morning at 9... poor kathy. **Dumbest License Plate: "GV THNX 2"  Thursday I went to school, came home and slept, went to work, then came home and did nothing.  Wednesday I honestly can't even remember what I did.  Tuesday I went to school, then went to kathy's right after and she made me lunch. Then we were bored and decided to go to Soundwaves, then to the mall... i made 4$ (kathy made 6$) take a survey at the mall... it was pretty worth it, cept the lady asking the questions was a fucking crackhead.
