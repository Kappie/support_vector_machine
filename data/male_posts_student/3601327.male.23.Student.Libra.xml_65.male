I have never read a movie critic that sounded like the average movie fan. They may sound like a student of film - but that's not the same thing. How about a movie critic who is more in the vein of a movie reporter. Tell us what you thought of it on a visceral level and not compare it to mid-20th century Argentinian civil-deconstructionist philosophist dogma or other such drivel.
