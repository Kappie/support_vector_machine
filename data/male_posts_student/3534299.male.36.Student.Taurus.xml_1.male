Well, today was one such day for me. Early on, I got the indications. A verbal duel with my wife who is good at it. Not that I am much different. The worst part came in the library where I sat on a sofa, a chair, and a toilet seat, trying to make sense of a few sentences. After a grueling, emasculating five hours,the result was two and a half page worth of editing that will pass through my eyes tomorrow again. All right, let me write about what was good today. I read on rediff.com an interview with Lt. Gen. Brar who talked about the famous (for me it is famous) Operation Bluestar at the Golden Temple in Amritsar. I wrote a three-line comment and the same was put up on the site by evening. It was satisfying to read my words in print--words that mean to me the world. At about 9 p.m. Suhas and Pradnya came over. We had pizzas together. They are a nice couple. Meeta enjoyed her Jalapeno-topped pizza. Then, after our neighboring couple went back, I tried to sleep but was not successful. I decided to proofread Suhas' thesis so that I could work on my things tomorrow. I completed it. That's good. Just before going to bed I wanted to look at my name on a case study I wrote with Kelle that is now a part of UNLV's Business Writing textbook. It was so satisfying, that one look. I want to write another case, with Heather Lusty. Her idea, sent by her father, is good, too. At last, when I was about to  disconnect the net and shut my laptop down, I remembered that I hadn't "blogged" today, so all these words. I love words. I hope my love is reciprocated. Tomorrow.
