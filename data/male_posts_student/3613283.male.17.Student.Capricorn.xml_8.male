I can tell you,  getting an American visa is not an easy journey.   When I arrived at the embassy, my first thought was "I should have taken a camera!". There were literally, early in the morning, a  loooong line of people waiting to enter the building . It was impressive. The whole street was virtually packed with people eager to get in. When U.S. officials such as Donald Rumsfeld tell you "people are lining up to come to the United States",  they're damn right!
