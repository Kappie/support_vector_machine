Not just because she prods me to continue this blogging, which I do appreciate because sometimes I feel so un-funny (like un-pretty of TLC almost), but also because funny shit just happens when we talk!  Shit that needs to be discussed, personified, evaluated, laughed about, and most of all mocked.  So someone got on her blog-posting-extravaganza (and for anyone who is reading this and wants to get more insight into just how funny things are in "lola's" mind, take a look at www.ellekinzy.blogspot.com).  Anyway, fragments galore here, but someone got on her blogspot and posted a comment in Portuguese.  We deciphered, after much altavista.com translation work, that it was something related to voting for governments that are corrupt or something.  What the hell?  I don't know how they do things down there in Rio, but we do the ENGLISH up here.  Hence our posting are IN English.  Another funny thing, everyone I know seems to be dealing with credit card fraud lately.  Okay, so everyone means two people, but one of them is lauren.  I think it's really ballsy of someone to take a credit card from someone and then use it at places.  This is 2004 people, this can be traced.  I'm scared of so many things that are so much less serious than credit card fraud that I can't even imagine running into a store and racking up a bill, knowing that it's OBVIOUSLY going to show up on someone's statement, and then the bank will  be after me!  I like, however, to envision her credit card as taking a vacation.  I loved the visuals that were invoked after reading her post (again, www.ellekinzy.blogspot.com), of her card taking it's own lil' trip to Texas.  Somehow the card has arms and legs (the arms and legs are a dark blue) with lil' 4 fingered (not five) puffy gloves and white booties on its feet.  Very Mickey Mouse, circa 1929, but IN FULL color, not that Steamboat Willie bull-shit, horn-tooting, African-American looking Mickey.  (That's not racial, he was on a paddle boat going down the MISSISSIPPI, and he was black, so shut up).  Anyway, so the card that says "ARVEST" across is, would probably be driving a convertible or some sort.  Something rented, and something definitely red.  Probably not like, loaded or anything, but a convertible nonetheless.  You have to keep in mind, this card has never had freedom of its own, so it heads SOUTH.  100% like the movies, on its way to the border.  It's NO surprise that lauren said the charges came from gas stations (hello, remember, the card IS in a convertible afterall).  I bet that mother f*er is on its way to Guadalajara.  HEY!  I'm between Oklahoma and Mexico RIGHT now while I'm in San Antonio!  Lauren, do you want me to hang out on the side of I35 for a while and see if I spot a miniature red (i'm assuming here) convertible cruising by?  I'll get that lil' bastard and have his car repo-ed FAST.  In fact, I saw a Jaguar getting towed off today (I'm assuming it was being repo-ed) while at lunch today as a matter of fact.  DO YOU THINK it was him?  There's no way he could reach the pedals though, so I'm gonna stick with the fact that it was a LITTLE car.  Very Stuart Little of him.  Next thing you know he'll be making friends with a cat, flying around in a remote control plane, etc and so on.  Speaking of flying around in a plane, my dad just called and needs a ride home from the airport, so I'm off to get him.  I'll ask if he saw anything suspicious out the window of the plane while flying back from Dallas.  Possibly a red bi-plane of peculiar size.    Updates to follow.  I'm gonna go smoke a little more crack-cocaine apparently.
