Like Mr. Reem's six-year-old daughter and birth control lol. And how Roxanne predicted what was going to be said. It was just an awesome day. And I got the most bills pasted! So I was happy. Then we took notes because we have a test on Friday. And then that was all we had to do. We got to leave after that. Then me, Bree, and today Ryn were gonna walk home again. But then the awesome Tara took us home again. She told us to get in her car and there was no exceptions. So we did, she is an awesome driver. It's always fun riding with her. Then I got home and did nothing for a little. And then I cooked myself two grilled cheeses for lunch. After that, I just kinda hung out. I went outside for a little. And just listend to music on the computer for most of the time. Then my dad got home and he mowed the lawn. And then Amanda came over with her dog which has the coolest name in the world. We talked, and then I had to go becaues my daddy was taking me out to eat. We went to Mcdonalds and I got two double cheeseburgers becasue we had coupons! My dad got to Big Mac's because he also had a buy one get one free coupon too! I love coupons! I could live off them, getting things for cheap or free is awesome! Like my two pair of jeans that I got at Old Navy one day for nine bucks each. Yeah they are a little bigger in the waist, but hey they work! You have to love Old Navy. But back to my day. I got home and ate with my dad, and then I just went and got on the computer and Andrew asked me if I wanted to go to the park with him, and he told me to invite Amanda, Natalie, and Whitney. So I did :-D. Whitney was in St. Louis so Amanda and Natalie walked to my house, and then we went to the park and met Andrew there. We played there for a long time, me and Andrew swung on the swings and I almost hit the tree, three times! It was scary, but fun too. And then Brian came with CJ. And then we decided to go play soccer at the soccer fields. Well we had to get the girls shoes so we went to Natalie's house and Amanda just used a pair of her shoes. Then we went back to the park, and then Amanda forgot her cell at Natalie's house so she ran and got it and then we went to the Soccerfields. And then Brian and Andrew killed us in soccer. They even let us have 5 free points! That's how horrible we are! But it was extremely fun. Then Andrew kicked the ball and it totally hit me in the back of the head. He didn't do it on purpose, but it hurt lol. But I still love you buddy! Don't worry! Then we played "smear the queer" which kinda worked out but Andrew was just way to fast for any of us to catch him. And then we just ended up on the soccerfields sitting and talking. And then we all decided it was time for us to go home, so I walked Amanda home, and then I walked home and drank about a half of a picher of koolaid. I was so thirsty and how can you not like koolaid!? They have a mascot that is a huge picher! How awesome is that!? And he busts in to peoples houses!! I always wonder if stuff falls into his huge hole on the top, and then that would just be nasty koolaid! But that's besides the point. And then I just came downstairs and did my APS. And then there was  urlLink this . Wow this kid is crazy, he has way more muscle then I do! Just think when he goes through puebrty! He is going to be one buff kid! I'm jealous of him! I have no muscle at all. Which makes me sad. But I'm just way to lazy to get any. Oh well. Well I told myself I was going to bed by 10:00, and that's oviously not happening. I'm talking to KLT on the phone which usually takes a long time. I'll just think about how I still love Mary-Kate Olsen evne thuogh she is in rehab for anorexia. I still love you Mary-Kate! Tell Ashely I miss her! Wow I'm to obsessed with them. I just need to stop right now!! Well I need sleep really really bad. So I'll talk to you later! Night!
