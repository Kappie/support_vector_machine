I'm not sure I'm going to actually dress up (God knows I might end up looking more like a wench than a pirate, if my wardrobe is any indicator), but it should be heaps of fun! I'll post some pics up if and when I take them.  Meanwhile, the house is smelling of cookies 'cos my housemate Judi has just baked oatmeal ones: low-fat, low-sugar, high in goodness, she says. She should be a copywriter. Heheh. Judi and I were meant to go out shopping today, but I cancelled the plans...she wanted me to own a pair of "gay pants" - i.e. pants that are tight enough to "show off" (yeah, right) thighs, legs and butt whilst being simultaneously comfortable and fashionable. Everything I own is too  baggy , she insists vehemently and with a vengeance.  If you've got it, flaunt it!  she shrieks.   I don't got it. _____________________________  Meanwhile, five music clips still available for download! Check out the "Nick's Music" link on the right. Would appreciate it if you let me know what you think! Thanks!
