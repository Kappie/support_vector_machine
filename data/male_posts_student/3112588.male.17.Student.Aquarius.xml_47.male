THEN, we talked for hours and hours--even passed out for a while LoL!! nikolitsa left around like 1:30am..and tim and i left nicoles around like...2:45am? tim had decided that if he fell asleep he wasn't going to wake up in time for work, so we made it an all nighter. we talked for about an hour after he got home...then i went to bed around 4:30am this morning. i really did have an awesome time all and all..(and i guess im "beautiful" haha). so yeah. dunno what ive got planned for today, but we'll see. i havent been planning lately guys! you would all be so proud of me----no more writing things down in my planner. with these people, there is no such thing as planning: they do what they want, when they want to do it. so im happy i guess....lovin' it! call me  white stuff !
