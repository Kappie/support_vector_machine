My eMac runs Mac OS X Panther.  where as pc's usually are running Windows XP.  i can honestly say that Mac OS X is MUCH more stable and gives MUCH less problems than Windows XP.  now some people say "Well I can do more on a PC than I could on a Mac!"  lol... obviously someone who has not used a Mac lately.  granted there are things that PC's can do that Mac's cant... but those things are usually just stupid little useless functions that no one uses.  personally, i'd rather have a computer that can actually DO the basic stuff than one that has a bunch of bells  whistles but still cant do my basic functions without crashing
