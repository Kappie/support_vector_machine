She has a voice that is much higher than I thought, but it's cool. And she's not short, she's "vertically challenged". How cool... we spent many times in Ottakars, which was actually really fun cause we weren't glued together, we had a bit of a look on our own before meeting up again. Which is nice, usually I feel awkward and end up being glued to the person, but that was nice. It really was... ended up not making too much of a fool of myself, too. I showed her where Badlands was. And as she said on her blog ( here ) there was a really strange song on the raddyo, the lyrics of which made us both giggle. They were sooo awful, seriously. But yeah... *sighs contendly* she's cool. *swoons and falls off chair* We got passport photos done, too. They're quite cute. And I didn't let her (though she wanted to) get the one of me grinning like a psycho... either a psycho who was about to stab her, or had my hand somewhere. I'll let you figure that one out. But still... *swoons again*  Lisa's blog is amazing. It is très cool ein design. Really is. Anyway...  CAYO was actually quite good this morning, too. Met Jack Kane's sister, who didn't appreciate me saying she looked like him, a little. But she doees, a bit. A bit.  *sighs* It was worth counting down to. Seriously, at 4PM yesterday, with Scott in Gloucester, I said "yay, 22 hours" so that'll show you how much I was looking forward to it. 'Twas worth it.  Quote of the day: "Do you hear the people sing, Singing a song of angry men? It is the music of a people Who will not be slaves again."
