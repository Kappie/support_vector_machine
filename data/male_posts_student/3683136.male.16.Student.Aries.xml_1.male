Very comfortable, surprisingly.  I'll probably do it again.  I think Louis has the right idea there.  Thanks kid.  Lunch with Gareth, home.  Left at 4 for the Center.  Got there around 5:10.  I was dissapointed.  I knew no one, and I felt really out of place there.  I enjoyed the discussion later, but for the most part I just felt awkward for a while.  I wanted to see Alex, but he didn't show.  Damn.  Got back to Linden, called sarah, and we drove around and ended up at the beach, which is always nice.  I'm glad we "made up" or whatever.  And we talked about a lot of shit, so I think we're fine.  This is good.  I worry about Sarah a lot.  She's my best friend, but I feel like I'm so helpless when she tells me shit.  I find it so hard to empathize.  And that just sucks.  The only thing worse than feeling really shitty is feeling really shitty and not being able to do anything about it.  My parents are acting eerily normal.  Is reconciliation in the cards?  I doubt it.  I hope it is.  But I doubt it.  -Mike  "I've got to admit it's getting better, it's getting better, all the time."
