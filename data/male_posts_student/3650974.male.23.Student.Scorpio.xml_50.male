If the saying "the good ones are always taken" is true, and you're not taken, are you therefore not a good one?  Considering it takes so much more energy to hate someone than to get along with them, how do so many people around the world manage to hate so many without becoming exhausted?  Why do we depend on, or even expect, others to make us happy?  How often is someone's opinion changed by what someone else says, rather than does?  Am I channeling Rusty right now or  what?
