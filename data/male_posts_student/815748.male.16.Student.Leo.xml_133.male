Not that I had anything to do with it, but we beat Pioneer Valley by one point at Fanueil Hall in the final trial with Associate Justice Roderick Ireland, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, presiding.  It was the funnest trial I've ever been to, which isn't saying a heck of a lot since I've only been to two others (plus three or four scrimmages).  This means that we get a whole new case, and in May, we'll go to Orlando to represent Massachusetts at the national tournament.  One of the funny things that happened at the trial was that Martin, on the cross of Faulkner, had to go through this whole analogy about the law of supply and demand using thirty-cent and three hundred-dollar pieces of gum from CVS, and the witness was showboating saying, "Well, I wouldn't shop at that store."  I thought it was a waste of time, but we won, so whatever.  Oh, and every performance got a perfect ten except both openings got nines and the Sarak direct got a nine.  Here are some other quotes from the trial:  "Yes, I found myself very talented." ---Jody Sarak  "And you knew that she is responsible for a disproportionate amount of e-mails that are responsible on the internet, don't you?" ---Martin Rotemberg  "You can't both be true, can you?" ---Palmer Cross
