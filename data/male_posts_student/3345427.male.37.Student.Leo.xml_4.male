Kinda interesting where we met and how we strted to talk about life. From a fetish list to a messenger chat, to BLOG. we crossed many lines of discussion about a great many things. A great deal of my time, especially at night, i sit here in front of this box, and i talk to people all over the world. i am a counselor, an activist, and HIV / addictions counselor as well. Last night i added another angel to my list of "people" out there that I hope to stay friends with.   Life throws us many things and decisions are part of them. Do I "come out," "what do I choose to be?" and where do I find my place in the world? I don't have all the answers, but I do have part of the roadmap of life. My roadmap. It is the plan that I follow every day. For those out there looking for the route into the world, I should tell you that the more people you talk to the greater chance you might have to find part of "YOUR" next portion of the map.   You never know where a conversation will go from beginning to end, and really, it might amaze you when you open yourself up to someone far away. I am amazed at how many things i have experienced seem interesting to many people. My life, as complex and insane it can get, has its teaching value. This is for Jon.   Hi there, I see your on your way to Singapore.. How kewl is that. I hope that one day you will find the courage to make that important choice you need to make. It will come when you are ready for it. It will appear to you and you WILL know it. But until then, follow the road, whereever it may lead you. It's all about the journey.   The JOURNEY....   You never know who you will meet on the road of life.  We are asked to start the journey only carrying what we need to. Please leave the samsonite luggage at home, excess baggage is useless.  Leave all the things you dont need to carry at home. Memories remain in your heart. You do not need pictures or books or junk that will hold you back or slow your pace.  If you need water, then find a water bearer. If you need food, find someone with a little bread. if there are elderly men or women on the road, walk with them a bit and help them on their way. Stop to talk to wayward journeymen. Ask them where they are going and see if you can't walk with them until they reach the city gates.   The journey never ends. The journey goes on as long as we choose to walk. and walk we will, but never alone. One just needs to realize that we are never really alone.   You never know when you are going to "Entertain an Angel."   Walk tall my young soldier. We are here and we walk with you. If you need guidance then ask us, I am sure that Someone has something to share with you about their own journey.  Lao Tse says: "You can do great things, by just doing nothing."   Have a good day.
