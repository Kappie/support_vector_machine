I sent my first resume and cover letter in the mail yesterday and have finished rough drafts of two cover letters for public relations firms.  The thought of working in the "business" world still scares me, but not as much as the thought of living at home for any extended period of time.  I missed a Cubs game on Mon. because my stomach sucks.  I've since given up alcohol and caffeine for the foreseeable future.  I'm going through withdrawal...need caffeine, know it will hurt.  I came up with this little gem at 3 am while trying to list traits advertising companies would like.  Obsessive fans are a lot like overprotective mothers; they don't want to share their loved one with anyone.  Both bands and children alike have to grow and by the time the band grows out of adolescence (or playing clubs) fans begin to cry foul.  Fans and parents need to learn to accept change.  Yes it sucks that you can't score tickets for when the band does do an one off club show or that your child moves away, but know that these changes lead to bigger success.  Ultimately, the early days of clubs or childhood, and the memories that accompany them will mean so much more the further the band or child moves on in life.    idea for book.  From Pop to Pap: The Decline of Pop Music Since 1950.
