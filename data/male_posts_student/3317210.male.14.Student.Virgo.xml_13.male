Either way, I'm still persevering with it, even though it isn't going too well =)  /me crosses fingers in hope of a new speed modelling topic at CGTalk  *sigh* Not a new subject... AGAIN! I can't take this. I need something to push me. The Weekend Challenge really did a good job, even if the result didn't turn out too well. It pushes you just to MAKE SOMETHING... Must stop sitting around and complaiming.  Just giving a link to myself - SUPER COOL FERRET MADE IN XSI!   urlLink Mr Ferret ;)   Anyway, SPEED MONSTERS! =P Quick 3D models I made, took about 20 minutes each   *heeheehee*  Watching Alias, and guess what... We just discovered, the Passenger... It's her... *horror music* SISTER! *background scream* Yeah, well... I knew about it before, because E! News doesn't respect the fact Australians are like two months behind all the TV shows... *sigh* lol... Also, Von found out that the Australian actress (oh yeah, go Aussies! Melissa George RULES! *innocent whistle*) was a double agent! WooT! They killed Sloan! WooT! Jack revived Sloan! Wait a sec... Eh? =P  Stui has been helping me out since this morning when I told him about the "Aerial Spire" thing (just remember, that the name is only a working name, not final), and its been quite fun =P We could become a double team of writers! WooT!  I've got a terrible terrible cough, which isn't getting anything out of my throat, but more specifically it feels like razors being run down the insides of my throat... Ouch... I stayed up until literally 4 AM yesterday (or more specifically, this morning) and went through three episodes of BBC Lord of the Rings Audio Series.  It's 10:30, and Alias just finished. Anyway, time to go, for the night draws close, and the world is beginning to withdraw. Farewell
