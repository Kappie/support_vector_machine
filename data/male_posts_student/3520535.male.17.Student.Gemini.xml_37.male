But there is also the idea of the nation. This comprises language, people, land, flora and fauna, as well as more adademic subects such as national ideals and types of governance. I have been reading a book called The Basque History of the World, and I've been thinking about what constitutes a nation, who are a people. In the end, there is no easy way to say that on this side of a border there are these people, and this side has these others. That's why nations such as the Basque Country are important to look to. They show us the difference between the concept of a nation, and its government.
