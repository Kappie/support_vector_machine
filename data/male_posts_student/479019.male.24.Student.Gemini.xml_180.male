Today I've got to go pick up family portraits. I'm also planning on going to SD with Brandon today, but I'm broke. That kind of puts a damper on things. I'm not sure what I want to do the next couple days. I kind of want to hit the beach before.. well... I have no opportunity to hit any beaches. I'll try to do that on Monday.  ***
