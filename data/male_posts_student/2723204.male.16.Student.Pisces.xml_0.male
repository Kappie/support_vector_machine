And i was thinking, who in this Earth can make such a watch? So fine and exquisite. Soon, i walked away but heard the footsteps of two men. I hid in the bushes to watch. One said, "hmmm, this is a fine watch, and i want to make one for myself, so I'll dissect it, examine and make an exact copy of it." The other said, "I'm gonna find the guy who made this watch, and ask him to make an exact copy of it.". As they went their separate ways, i was thinking, "why not ask the guy who made this watch, ask thim to teach me, then i'll make as many watches as I want."     the afore mentioned watch analogy is really a philosophical cliche, but i've added some stuff which actually shows the divide in religion and science and have added my own stance to it. Alright, alright, before you thought that I was talking crap. I shall make this Analogy clear in the context of God. The watch is the Earth, the secrets of nature and the exploitation (both good and bad) of its resources. The main character, is me. And that guy who wanted to make a watch himself by simply examining the watch are the scientists and the guy who wanted to find the watch-maker are the religious. And obviously, in case you're a pretty dense idiot, the watch-maker is God.  Obviously, there has been a divide between religious and scientific circles. And my advice to Both sides, is to stop your pride, stop sticking your nose up in the air, stop being that arrogant prick, and start working with each other, in short stop being total asses. I'll expand on my analogy tomorrow, this is basically an intro. Anyway, i'm just sleepy if not i'll write more stuff.
