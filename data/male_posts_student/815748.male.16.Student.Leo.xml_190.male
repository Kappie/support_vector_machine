The hikes lasted at least four hours per day, and though I got dirtier than I've ever been, the food that the porters cooked, the satisfaction involved, and the unparalleled sights -- such as a plethora of stars because of the utter lack of pollution and lighting and the view of the cloud cover from above while on the ground -- were more than worth it. Everyone, except for Charlie Mokriski (who got dizzy on summit day and had to stay behind) and Mr. Jobe (who stayed with him), got to both Gilman's Point and Uhuru Peak. Summit day was incredibly difficult. The altitude, which had previously caused only mild headaches, hindered my breathing immensely during the ascent. We awoke at 11 pm after a three-hour nap, hiked for more than twelve straight hours, took another hour-long nap, and hiked for another three hours. At least I'm now able to say that I've climbed the tallest mountain in Africa.  Zanzibar, where we'll spend the last few days, is very touristy, i.e., good for R The beaches are pristine, though I'd rather just hang out and do my own thing. Well, I'll be home in four days. See y'all soon; picture-sharing and birthday fun are coming right up.
