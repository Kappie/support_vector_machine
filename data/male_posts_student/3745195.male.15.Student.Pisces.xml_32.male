I stayed there lying on the ground for about 20 minutes thinking about what I did wrong. It was a sad time for me and yet the next day I came up to that same spot and lied underneath that tree and felt at peace. It made me question myself, How did I find comfort in this place, the place that I broke down and cried at just the day before. So I lied down and started reading/ watching the clouds and it felt so calming. I could hear the birds chirping above my head and the "wizz" of the cars as they pass by in almost a rythmical pattern. It was really relaxing and I think I might go up there again tomorrow. It's one of my favorite places now.  I love you
