Norman is a dead-ass place now.  lauren and I were able to cause some last minute havok though, before she shoved off.  Havok wasn't really much more than drinking beer on my balcony and then falling asleep, but it was a fun time.  Can't help but be sad to see you go.  Can't help but be sad to see fun times go too.  Just a few acquaintances basically still remain in this town that seems so unfamiliar these days.  I drive around and stop in places that seem so memorable, only to recognize no one and feel older than everyone.  It's like that whole "alone in a crowded room" feeling.  Everything looks familiar, but nothing seems to feel the same.  Time is pushing me out of here.  So, needless to say, it's boring around here and I'm anxious to get the next few months over with and be done with this place too.  It's not that I'm hating it a ton or anything, but there's just nothing left.  It's just a place now.  Like staying in an empty apartment, the walls of this town seem bare and filled with holes where memories once hung, and the rooms seem too big and empty.  The streets almost echo when I walk down them.  I don't walk down the street very often, but I imagine these things, you see.  Everything changes, and it is so weird how the timing seems right.  Running off from this place in the middle of things being the same would feel sad.  Six months ago I would be leaving things behind.  Departing knowing that I'm leaving nothing behind fits better.  Back to that empty apartment example though: it sure is bland around here.  I went to Wal-Mart tonight to get ONE thing, and wound up with 50 bucks worth, of course.  I hate how that happens.  I also hate how it was so crowded.  I let a guy go ahead of me because he was buying 3 things.  Nice deed of the day.. DONE!  I squeezed it in just before midnight.  Just kidding, I have no "nice deed quota" each day.  More like one each month.  Kidding again.  Year.  K, again.. with the kidding.  I'm off to bed now.  Goodnight.
