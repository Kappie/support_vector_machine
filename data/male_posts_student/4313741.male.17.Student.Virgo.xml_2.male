I think I'll get by the first term without too many bumps.  The only bad thing is that my gf is leaving for college soon :( she's going all the way to corvalis for OSU and I'm stuck here in bumsville :'( the only reason she's going to corvalis is cause she's smarter than me... ok i guess that's a good reason but i'm still gonna miss her :(
