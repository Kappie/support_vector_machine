And then I thought of the very teenage male tendency to create an idealized version of a girl and to then worship the image, rather than the reality. I know that creating an obsession begins with daydreaming too much about the person. You start inventing little scenarios, and you half-begin to believe they actually happened. You begin to feel an unreciprocated affinity with the object of your affection. And then you feel embarrassed, so you bottle everything up and slowly lose your mind. If you turn a girl into a goddess, all you can do is worship her. Forget talking to her, forget being equal with her, forget getting her to like you. If you think she's above you, then she will, too. It's odd how often this stuff happens to people who should know better. I think that's what being a teenager is all about: knowing what you should do (or not do), and then turning around and doing it.
