I could make an image of my old hard drive and copy it to the new one, but I'd rather reinstall everything and just copy over what's needed. I think that would be better.  It's nice and black with silver on the fron't. I got a black keyboard and new speakers that came along with it. The keyboard doesn't really make a sound which is good it you aren't supposed to be on it =P. The speakers put out wonderful sound. I don't think I'll ever go back to my old ones. My old ones were white anyway, so with everything black but the monitor and mouse, why get white speakers?  The specs aren't that great but it's better than I had and I'm not complaining. Her they are:  2.60 GHz 40GB Hard drive 256MB of RAM CD-RW Drive (48x Max. Write speed)  That's basically it. I hope to have 2 hard drives soon. My formatted old one, and then the new one I have now.
