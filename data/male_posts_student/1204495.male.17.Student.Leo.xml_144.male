Half term, I spend most of my time doing loads of research for our Toung Enterprise company on our final product and then in last week's meeting it came to being put into little teams working on developing things - the first being a digital jigsaw for the Christmas Trade Fair, the second being fundraising ideas and the third being a tourist guide for Stockport. I was asked if I'd like to be in charge of the mini-team I said yes. The Company Secretary wrote it down in the minutes and then ten minutes later the whole company was asked who wanted to be in charge. I said I would again, but Mark said in a louder voice that he would do it. Guess who gets their name scribbled out? I spent my half term doing loads of work when I could have been having fun - they don't like my research. *fumes*"  i don't exactly call asking 10 people a lot of research now do you?!  [will update later on got papers to do]
