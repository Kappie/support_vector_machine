My dad thinks I look rediculous. He said I look like a canary (even though it's a creamy yellow). He probably thinks I'm gay now, and he can't help laughing at me every time he sees me. I think I look like a banana; a very rich, well dressed banana. Or a pimp... Or a really rich motherfucker who owns a huge yacht in Anapolis, MD...  I am so badass. 8-)    NP: Michael Hedges-  Breakfast In The Field , and  Oracle  albums
