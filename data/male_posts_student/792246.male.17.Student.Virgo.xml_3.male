A boyfriend The Congo(I'm really running out of time and Lizzy WILL kill me) A boyfriend Love Someone to fuck A boyfriend.  Well we know whats on my mind. Oh well.  I got my schedule. Yay! For all of you who go to Paly, you can get your schedule at viking.paly.net/dev. Assuming of course you can navigate their shit. Good times.  I got a Japanese dictionary! Yay! Now I can bring it when we go downtown to scare people. Not to mention I've been slowly making a list of all the "useful" words in the book. Sadly lacking much slang though. Super ultra mega formal japanese all the way through, with a few exceptions. Chinpo chinpo chinpo! Of course, this also means I have no excuse to delay starting my random translation of the 53843 Japanese artifacts lying around my room. Though I still really need a kanji dictionary. And furigana. Oh welly.  I've been playing a lot of Neverwinter Nights recently. I have come to the conclusion that having cows and chickens in the party is the coolest thing ever, despite a complete lack of usefulness. I just found a nymph's home. She's been keeping prisoners. Like the one under a spell that was standing there naked. Gee, I'd sure hate to be imprisoned there.  I'm really suffering from Rocky(for those of you are anal and/or Jonathan, Horror Picture Show) withdrawal. Not the movie itself obviously, but the whole experience. No amount of listening to clips from the show in Tokizawa can cure that. Or Yatta for that matter. Ah, Yatta. I so want to own Yatta on DVD. Along with Bible Black, hehe. Damn it. All the copies on Kazaa I've found of that have been raw, no sub, no dub. And since the dub was the best part("Why are you squeezing my tit professor"). Oh well, we'll just have to buy it for Jonathan's birthday or something.  My family sucks at keeping secrets. Nuff' said. Guess it runs in the family.  So last night I saw "Roman Holiday" with Kelly. The best part was this Italian taxi driver in the beginning who randomly went "BAU!" in the middle of one sentence. We're going to make a sequel, with sex and violence. Most likely titled, "Roman Holiday:The Sex and Violence Edition". Fun.   And on that note, girls suck. Goodbye   I should point out that none of the items on that list have actually been given to me, and I happen to have another birthday coming up in August. Something to think about. Ah, the days when Yatta was fresh.
