Their links page can be found here.   urlLink  Links    "Do we really want to see public libraries change into commercial, moneymaking enterprises, where the wants and needs of the local community get lost amongst the pound notes? Do we really want to lose the opportunity that the public library offers for ordinary people to be able to think and debate issues, to pursue various leisure pursuits and to obtain information? It might not be ideal, but what is round the corner, and in fact, is already staring us in the face is the business takeover of public libraries. The primary goal of these private operators is and must always be to make profits, which conflicts with goals about serving the wants and needs of the local community, caring for people and notions of equality and social justice. "  Just having some fun with the topic!
