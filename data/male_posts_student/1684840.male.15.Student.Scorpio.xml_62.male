Said hi to freinds and ppl I hadn't seen over the holidays (erm... everybody!) and gave out Lifesavers and everyone was asking me about it :| lol!  Well, my reply was finally a "Yes I am moving, Woohoo!" and some were shocked and some were happy lol.  Information Systems was very boring indeed.  Mrs. Checketts is not what I expected her to be like in lessons, but she is still a big old weirdo o.O!  The rest was ok, but double cooking just rocks!  I felt the effects of jet lag this morning when I couldn't concentrate at all.  I got really hot and stuffed and I couldn't think at all, then I relaxed a bit and set my head straight.  I'm not suprised I didn't fall asleep though in I.S, it was borrring.  I started to wish I hadn't have taken it :S  I'm sweating like mad right now, my allergies are going mental and I feel stuffed up :(  Why can't us Brits have air conditioning too!  Smudge is going back to the Cat's Protection on Friday because he can't stay here :(  I'm gonna miss him soo much, even though he damages my health.  It's not fair...
