I'm of the opinion that if you don't know [much] about a subject, it's probably best to keep from voicing your views on the matter to others. Take for example, the average American, and the many different views on how money should be handled. This is just me, but unless you are financially so well off that you don't have to work, you shouldn't be telling anyone how they should handle their money. Especially since most Americans spend more than they make in a month, and the average debt for every man, woman and child in America is over $5000.  I'm sure there must be millions of little kids running around, but I also know they don't have credit cards. So for every man, woman and CHILD to have that much debt -- the actual average amount of debt for those who can have debt is significantly higher. (Just a side note, this is unsecured debt [e.g. credit cards] and doesn't include mortgages or car loans.)  But back to the point in question.  Would you take tennis lessons from a brain surgeon? Not a chance. Would you ask Pete Sampras to take out the possible cancerous lump in your brain? Again, no way.  So why is it that people feel so free to talk about what they know nothing about? Sure, its a free country...You can say what you want, free speech and all -- but that doesn't mean you are right, and to someone who actually does know -- you sound like a complete idiot.  And I'm fairly certain that no one intentially wants to look like an idiot.  Just a thought...
