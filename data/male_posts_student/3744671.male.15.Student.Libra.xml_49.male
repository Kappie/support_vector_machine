Well, there is a TV channel that can be ordered from most satelite or cable providers called G4TechTV. This is my most favourite TV station ever! I watch it more than anything else on my dish!  I love it so much because it's a TV channel dedicated to video games and tech related stuff! Every single show is about video games, or tech realted stuff! I't absolutely phonomenal! If you like these things too, I definitely recommend you get it, if you can! You shouldn't have any problems if you have a decent satelite or cable provider. The greatest thing for me is the price point! I have a fairly limited budget and can still easily afford this channel. It's only $1.99 plus tax per month from bell ExpressVU. However, I've unfortunately heard that some providers can charge more for it, still well worth the price of admission!  For more information, go to  urlLink G4TechTV       The website will give you all kinds of info on the channel itself, plus the different porgrams it has on!      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
