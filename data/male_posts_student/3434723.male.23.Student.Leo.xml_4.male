My friend needed to go to a place about a 100 km away to get a deal done, and since he was not very fond of riding long distance alone, he asked me along. Since I liked to drive I readly agreed. I drove all the way there and most of the way back. It was a bit hilly at the place and the bike was not a powerful one, but still we managed to return home today itself. Our destination was a College situated about 2 kms from the nearest town, and the amazing fact is that there are no bus plying on that route. As I said earlier it was pretty hilly there, but the atmosphere was very tranquilant, nature very beautiful. The place was not uninhabited. Too bad I didn't have a camera with me, since a picture is worth a thousand words. But I guess those who read this would have to be satisfied with the few words I have put here.
