Everyone's gearing up for spring break around here, but I'll be working down here at Uni, so I'm really not that pumped. Ulli, I know what you mean about missing that something. I think what we all need is a little reunion. My vote for destination is Chicago! Just kidding...you're all welcome any time, but the only place less likely for a reunion would be New Zealand. Speaking of which, anyone heard from Caroline in a while? It seems that most people have dropped off the face of the earth. Adam will have to be dragged out of Mas i Mas if we want him to contribute to this blog. Or perhaps he's karaokeing (is that a word??) at Selmo, singing Queen at the top of his lungs with his new pals who inevitably can't sing as well as us. We did have Vegard, after all. Simon is currently searching China for Vegard, his next big prospect. Last weekend in Chicago was awesome. It's impossible to describe how cool it is to see 80 story buildings rising straight up along the river banks. Sears Tower's still there...still tall, too. I was gonna take some pics for everyone, but I figured that might make me look a bit touristy with my interviewers. Anyway, gotta run to Business Law now...should be fun. Studied "stee-moo-lee" today in marketing. Adam and Svana will remember how our Cons. Behaviour professor butchered stimuli every time and I nearly died with laughter. Well, my professor today pronounced it correctly, so it wasn't nearly as much fun. But I'm off. Ciao ciao for now, brown cow.
