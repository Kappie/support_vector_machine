I agree global warming is serious and the open use of chlouroflouro carbons which is a large addition to the problem should be regulated in third world countries. About the movie "The Day after tomorrow"; I went into the movie expecting it to be concerning the effects of global warming but really they just threw watchers some bs about the North Atlantic current shifting and heating things up. They did not address the common problems in the world today that cause global warming. All in all the movie had good special effects and it was cool to see mother nature wreck havoc. Anyway I hope you all have a great weekend.   Chris
