Why HERE IT IS!=P  ===> By Nicole Schneegas; Loara KC            Katella, Savanna, and Loara Key Clubs came together one morning on May 22 to help children at the Anaheim Children's Arts Festival show their creativity and imagination.  Arriving at 8:30 AM was no problem for the dedicated volunteers.  Smiling faces as we helped children with origami and the satisfaction of watching the children enjoy themselves made it all worth it.. With all the booths lined up and the air full of excitement, the street looked like a market place, bustling and electrifying, with all of the volunteers manned at a boot, ready for anything.  We got to be children again and time well spent.  This annual event is awesome, so watch out for it next year!  Unfortunatey Loara failed to be top five clubs that rocked the house this month.  Loara was placed at 6th rite under the last club that is printed in the Top 5 =(  Comon Loara what happened we can make the Top 5 at least!!
