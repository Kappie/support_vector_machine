But since I'm writing about it, do I still not care?  I'm listening to dream theatre now. It's different. Reminds me of X-Japan. Tragic story that X-Japan. The band version of Michael Jackson. Well... not really.  Watched Moulin Rouge yesterday. Realized that Bazz Luthman has his own style in film. It was reflected in Romeo and Juliet too. That's what makes him special. That's what makes him stand out from the other directors. What I don't understand, is why the film was so award winning. I wasn't really touched by it. Beauty, truth, freedom and most of all love. It's good.. love.  Her kiss was as velvet and silk are to skin. Love. It's a good thing, I think.
