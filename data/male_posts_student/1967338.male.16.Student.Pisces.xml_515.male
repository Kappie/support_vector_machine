That means that they have to cover all expenses up to and including food and drink and also have to have comfy sitting area. Paul and the Comstocks have this, I've never been to the homes of Marten, Erin, Sophia, Thomas, Rachel or Tyler so I can't judge their homes yet, however, I'm allergic to cats, so I don't think Marten's house will work.  Okay Here's the schedule for Cons: MovieCon, WestWingCon, AnimationCon, WestWingCampCon, MusicalCon. We'll set dates to these when we get to that bridge.  Okay, Tim's a little bitch, so I have to go. Toodles!  I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.
