It feels nice to be in Irvine again… rolling down Culver Drv. and listening to KROQ’s 90s music flashback. The music and the campus made me forget about Binghamton for a while. It’s almost like the Albert that’s a grad student there was gone, and I was back to being the person who lived in Irvine for 17 years. The music of the 90s is the soundtrack to a good chunk of my life here. I couldn’t help but feel reminiscent of the past.   Last night it was cool hanging out with the posse (Derek, Jon, and Brandon) as well. At  urlLink BJ’s  I also ran into someone that was on my high school wrestling team that I hadn’t seen in years. Life is familiar here, because my life has a history here. This makes it so easy to let go of memories of Binghamton… 2500 miles away from here. There are familiar faces in Binghamton since it’s such a small place, but there’s no history to it. Life there has always been extremely liminal…   That’s not say that Irvine feels exactly the same as it did in the past, but memories are anchored to a long chain of events, and places.  ***
