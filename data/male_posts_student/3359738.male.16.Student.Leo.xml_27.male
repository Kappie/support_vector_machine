It had an unexpected twist in the end, and it's one of those that once you watch the ending it makes you go "ah! so that's why   did   when   happened", and that's always fun. The special effects were amazing, and the score is  AWESOME , and done by my favourite composer, the amazing  urlLink John Williams . The only thing I despise slightly is the voice that dubbed Ron (in the Spanish dub which I watched since I am in Spain), but hey, Spain's to blame for that, not the guys that made the movie.  I enjoyed this third movie a lot more than the previous one in the saga,  urlLink Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , and I thought it was a lot more action-packed and more fast-paced than the first one,  urlLink Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone , though the first still has the original Potter "magic".  I recommend everyone who liked the other Harry Potter movies to watch Harry Potter 3. I thought it was quite worth watching. ;)
