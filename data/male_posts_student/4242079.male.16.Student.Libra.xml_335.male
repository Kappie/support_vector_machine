Not because I don't enjoy writing anymore, and not because I don't have the time to (today, I watched a movie not just once, but one and a half times). It's not like I don't have anything to say, either. There's lots of things I would like to write about...but...I don't know what's going on.  I am alive though. Been going to work, reading a book, getting phone bills. I got my long distance bill today. 17 minutes worth of calling to New Mexico for $1.80. Since the service charges are $5.00, it doesn't make any sense to have this plan. Maybe I should move someplace far so I have an excuse to call long distance.   Easter was good. Dug out lawn furniture for deck now that snow is melted. I love my deck.  Meh.  Here's to blogging.
