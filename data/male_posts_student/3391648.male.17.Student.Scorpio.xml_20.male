It is discrimination against a crazy australian (maybe jewish!). If he wasnts to risk and indanger his life just to make a point about an animals habbitat and raise the much needed awareness that kids and adults wouldnt recive other wise then he bloody well should and he bloddy well does. If what he is doing is wrong and bad for these aniamls, then what the fuck are we doing for the animals? Its simply egotistical biast views from people who obviously dont relise that the reason those 10ft seals are indangered is because they drive a 10 seater family wagon for only there money hungry selves. Go Steve, have some fun and educate us all!
