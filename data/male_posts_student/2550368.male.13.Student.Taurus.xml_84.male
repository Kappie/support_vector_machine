YES ITS A HUGE DEAL the crosshairs are fucking huge and it is impossible to aim! What are they trying to do make us people with 1600x1200 res on 21'' montiors suffer? HOW AM I GOING TO WIN MY MATCH TOMAROW? THATS RIHGT THEY CHANGE CS 2 DAYS BEFORE MY FIRST EVER MATCH IN A LEAGUE.  I use to love steam.. sure the semi-constant crashing was bad and the "Game currently unavalible" problem sucked at the error about the service not being started was bad but this has drivin me off the top. VALVE IF YOU GUYS KEEP CHANGING COUNTER-STRIKE MORE I AM F*CKING UNINSTALLING COUNTER-STRIKE AND PLAYING A REAL GAME LIKE Unreal Turnoment 2004 (Hehe a real game like unreal).  Ok my weekend: Lan/Birthday party on friday (Got over $100). Slept at 1:30PM Woke up at 11PM Slept at 2AM Woke up at 8AM  I went to best buy today and baught a logitech MX510 for better acuracy in counter-strike ($50) BUT NOW I GUESS IT WONT MATTER.  UHG. Im gona go play cs and kill people to take out my angure.
