Luckily, I've been able to get to our library, where I can make a post with a little bit of free time... check out this "OWNAGE"   Man Jailed for Shooting Off His Testicles  Tue Jul 13, 1:06 PM ET  LONDON (Reuters) - A British man who accidentally shot himself in the testicles after drinking 15 pints of beer was jailed for five years on Tuesday for possessing an illegal firearm, a court spokesman said.  David Walker, 28, was arguing with a friend at a pub in South Yorkshire, northern England, when he went home to get his sawed-off shotgun, which he jammed into his trousers.  But as he walked back to the pub, the gun went off, blasting pellets into his testicles. Doctors later removed what remained of his testicles during emergency surgery.  Walker admitted possessing a prohibited weapon at a hearing in June at the court in Sheffield.   Wow, how horrible... let's hope we don't see "PWN493" like that ever again...
