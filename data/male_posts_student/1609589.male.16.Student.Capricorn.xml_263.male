I've been watching them argue and scuffle about making a website, getting servers they don't need, and who is in the clan or not.  And in the midst of all this, they decide that the most important thing for them to do at this juncture is change their name to Digital Adrenaline(you may shoot yourself now). Can you get any more generic? I bet there are at least 2 other clans out there named that.  I refuse to join a clan, even if they asked me to.   [edit: I would start one, but i would never join an existing one]  Why? Because I, unlike many gamers these days, play games to have FUN. When you join a clan, you join a world of schedules, rules, and expectations. It's no FUN. I could have sworn that GAME developers developed GAMES, not serious sports.  Here's what would make me like clans- since it's just a game, and if they lose, they act like their life is over. My idea is, give them something they really need to worry about. Have it where, if your clan loses, you get shot in the knee. See? Problem solved. I'm happy because idiots are getting shot in the knee, and the clans have actually something to worry about! Drinks all round!  But of course, sport-gamers are stupid, they would never listen to reason.   I heard an arguement about Battlefield 1942 by a friend of mine, he said "Man, that game's no fun, all you do is mess around." and my rebuttle was "...isn't that the point?"  When I play a game, i'm sick of realism. I want to have my expectations of what's possible blown right out of the sky. Everybody wants me to play America's Army(a painfully realistic simulation, i don't even call it a game), which is no fun at all because you have to complete training (some of which consists of getting the entire fucking vietkong thrown at you and 3 seconds to kill them all, with having a 12 second fucking reload animation) before you can even get to play with your friends. It's stupid shit, i'm gonna go play TRON 2.0 some more.  That one was good. It took everything Tom Clancy and the folks who came up with the rules of football said, and kicked them out on their asses. TRON 2.0 = TRON + badass + totally kicking the ass of my perception of what's possible(!!) + Rebecca Romijn.  The levels never got boring (Halo, Enter the Matrix), the combat never got monotonous(Serious Sam, Serious Sam, Serious FUCKING Sam), and the multiplayer doesn't lag like a whore on most occasions.  Too bad i've beaten it twice on it's hardest difficulty level. That's enough for me, unless i want to replay it just to see the good-looking cut-scenes.  I can't think up a good ending for this, so I'll leave you with...  END OF LINE.
