Instead of brooding about whether someone you met will continue to like you after spending a day with you, ask yourself, How am I liable to offend that person? Be specific. If you discover a fear of embarrasing that other person by acting immaturely, ask yourself by what actions you may do this. List them. The clearer your picture of how you may do damage, the better prepared you will be against doing it. Many of us exist with the vaguefeeling that we are undesirable, but few of us ask ourselves precisely how do we make ourselves undesirable? By asking such questions, we would, in effect, be rehearsing what not to do,a process sometimes even more valuable than rehearsing what we want to do.
