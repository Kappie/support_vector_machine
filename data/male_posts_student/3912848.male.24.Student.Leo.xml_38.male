(Read the  urlLink AP short ).  Most of you won't find this interesting, but this is just the sort of fresh constitutional issue that excites nerds like myself. (We need  something !)    The cases are  Granholm v. Heald  (as in Michigan Gov. Jennifer Grahholm);  Michigan Beer  Wine Wholesalers Association v. Heald ; and  Swedenburg v. Kelly .
