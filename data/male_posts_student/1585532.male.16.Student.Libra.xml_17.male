Anyways, yes, I did have a huge piece of green tree fall near my house yesterday.  It was quite freaky.  I didn't mind it though, gave me an excuse to use a chainsaw (muahahaha!).  Has anyone noticed the heat is just crap lately?  I hate this stuff, its evil as evil can be.  It needs to die, and fast.  Well, I'm about spent, since I'm posting on my laptop and I don't want it to explode...::KABOOM::  --Error:  The current user can not be reached at this time, please try again later.--
