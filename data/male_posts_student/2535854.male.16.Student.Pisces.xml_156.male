A pair of black trousers...I have one but they are rather tight and would be nicer if an inch longer...I wanna wear them at Commencements and I don`t give a damn about if I have to wear school pants at the show...my ass is available for kissing to those who would be against this.   My desktop computer`s problems to end..  Haziqah`s blog address...I know you`ll be reading this...you just wait!  I think I wanna get a haircut soon...I think..?  Some snacks!  Try and get back my wifi..though my method is rather risky...  $$$$$$$$$$$$$  Study...exams are on the 9th of August..  Start working out again and train for handball...im so out of favour and by the way, i`m so weak and have no speed to speak of when running and stamina that I need to hop my yella ass on the exercise bike and start cycling and pushing...Those Abs need work as well.   That list was totally useless and jobless!
