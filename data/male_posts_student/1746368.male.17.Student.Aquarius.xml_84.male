I post as "2corinthians418" please, join! We want as many members as possible. Tell 'em that I sent you.  Eh, Steve is being mean! He got a box of Skittles and he won't share! If you would like to see how big the box is take a look at my avatar (the little image underneath my screen name [2corinthians418]) at Conglomerate Speech.  That is all.  No really, 'tis all.   Okay okay!  You got me! There is more. I shall now recap my day as of now.  I woke up and got out of bed. I started playing a little Mario Kart (okay, like three hours worth) and I beat a few things. Then at about 10 in the AM I went next door and watched X-Men (the first one). I was planning on watching the second one, but by the time the first one was over it was way past 12 and I thought that I should probably call Dominique. So I did. She wasn't home. I accidentally (yes, accidentally) took a nap today. I was waiting for her to call back, and I was reading and I just fell asleep. Luckily she didn't call back, or in all likelihood I would not have woken up. I woke up and called her again and to my delight, she was there. Anyways, long story short, never lose your glasses, unless you can see without them.   That is your punishment for reading on. You get a weird ending. Maybe I will tell the rest tomorrow, although it is just as non-interesting. G'bye.
