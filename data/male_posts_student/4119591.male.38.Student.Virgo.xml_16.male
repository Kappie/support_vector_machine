A Santa Rosa teacher gave an assignment in class that encouraged students to send the message to a member of Congress. The lesson was supposed be an "experiential exercise that would instill a sense of fear so they would have a better sense of why more people don't participate in the political process."  Expression is one thing, threating violence is another. Class dismissed?  I'm waiting up to see how long it takes for the FBI to arrive at my door.
