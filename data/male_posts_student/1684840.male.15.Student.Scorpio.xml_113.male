And of course whenever the sky is clear, the air is bitterly cold!!  The backs of my hands are pretty numb and it is prooving to be a little hard to type right now lol.  Me and James went out for a walk.  We went across a motorway bridge near to a field where there were hardly any street lights in sight, boy was it a pretty sight, however, we didn't hang around for long because the darkness was starting to sink in and the feeling of ghosts and scary night beings forced us to turn back towards the light :D  Maybe my Dad could take me over one time.  I am still yet to spot the Andromeda constellation.  Anyways, we had a good time!  James got some frubes and we squirted a few over the pavement (LMAO daft I know - haven't had so much fun in a long time :P)  Anyway, my hands are starting to feel more normal now and Im gonna go chill a bit, goodbye!
