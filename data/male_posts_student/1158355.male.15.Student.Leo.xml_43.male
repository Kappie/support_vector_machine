I went to Keith's today and watched The Ring and then Steve's mom brought me home, and brought Keith and Steve to the little league baseball game to ump but it was cancelled (good news). So Keith and I met Ashley and Val at Dave and Buster's and we hung out and shit. Ashley I Love You! I came home, watched the end of Mothman Prophecies and went to bed. Ok, so that's all folks, stay tuned for another BLOG tomorrow!
