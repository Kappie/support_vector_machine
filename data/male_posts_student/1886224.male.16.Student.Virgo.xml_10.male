I hit a single right past the 1st baseman and then a bunt single 2 innings later. I went 2-3 last night with 2 singles and a ground out. We had a chance to win the game in the 7th inning, but Huntington was able to score two more runs to tie it at 4-4. We went into one extra inning and didn't score anything. We ended tying which was rare. We are 1-4-1 on the season. It feels good to actually tie. We are playing against college level people and its hard to win. So far on the year I am 2-8 (.250 AVG) with 2 singles, 4 strikeouts, and 2 walks. I hope I can keep this momentum going.
