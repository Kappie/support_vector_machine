So I made book with him. if i was right he would wear shorts to school for one week. then he said, if i lost, i had to get all my hair cut, then go to school bareheaded. After checked the book, i knew i lost. i had to get all my hair cut. but i kind of didn't like that. i had never been bareheaded since i was a baby. after all, it's so embarrassing. i called him to know whether i was allowed not to have my hair cut. i begged him. but he said NO!!! i was so embarrassed and angry with him for he was my best friend. however it's not his fault. then, today (Saturday) i went to barber with my sister. i asked the barber to cut all my hair. i was so nervous then. The barber said nothing but to get started right after I told him I wanted bareheaded. My dearest hair was falling down as my heart's beating so fast. I didn’t know what I would be like. Very fast half of my head had been done. My scalp was so white. No time for thinking, hair had gone! I looked at myself in the mirror. Was that me?? however, it’s not that bad. At least my head is inerratic (round, not very strange).it's not as ugly as i ever expected. I was satisfied with the barber’s work. He made me look not very bad. Then I went home pleasurablely. I felt I was quite different. Whole new feel``````````````~~~ I would get used to that. I told my classmates on QQ. They were all surprised at me. I phoned Linda. Luckily she was not angry. Then until now I was writing what happened. Lol…………………… Okay. Whatever. It happened already.
