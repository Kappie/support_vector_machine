So today at dinner, I don't know how the fuck it came up, but my mom started talking about my friends. She wanted to know if I was still talking to my friend Jason. Here's the reason why she asked: Jason acts in ways that would give you the impression that he isn't straight (well this is true, because he's bisexual). So when she asked me that, I answered no because he was going to college and was pretty busy. Then you know what she said? She said "Good. I don't want you to be talking to him anymore. I dont want you hanging out with gay people because being gay is contagious." The she said that it was a   fact   that if you are staright and hang out with gay people, that you will become gay yourself. I just wanted to slap her and cuss her out right there and then. She just pissed me off so much. So then I said to her, "You don't want us talking to Rodel either then? (Rodel is my only gay cousin, who I still haven't called)" Then she said "No, that's different." In my head, I was thinking it's the same thing. So ya, that really got me pissed.
