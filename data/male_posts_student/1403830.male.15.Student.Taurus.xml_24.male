For how much I like her  I should know more about her  Or maybe we should just have more in common  Or maybe  We should say fuck formalities  And get together and have a lot of kids  And then I could be like now we have somthing in common  And sure  We might be labeled as trailer trash  But love conquers all  Even trailer trash  Sometimes I wish what I said was true  Like when I talk about how hot I am  Or how I have to fend off girls by the masses  That's the stuff that's supposed to be funny but its actually kinda sad  Because its kist an attempt for me to put all my insecurities on the  table  Maybe I'll scare them off one day
