The night before I had stayed at Niklas's and we had stayed up all night watching movies cause  the weather was shit  so there was nothing else to do. All movies were good apart from one shitty one called " Dahmer " or something similar to that. I have never seen a movie so boring and so homeosexual as that in my whole life.  FUCK IT! . Pointless piece of crap!     Anyways. I had a boring day since I had to go to Falkenberg to see my grandma (who turned 70) and my other cousins, who all look the same and are still as  boring  as they always are!  Good thing I have FIFA 2004 on my phone =)!
