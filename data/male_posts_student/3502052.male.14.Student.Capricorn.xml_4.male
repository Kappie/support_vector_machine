This year Greece won the Euro 2004 tournament.  Not only that in the final three games they played they held their oponents scoreless.  Now thats something, especially since they wouldnt be what i would call the worlds greatest team.  so we wonder how do they do this??? its  called unity.  they pulled together to keep behind the ball and then counter attacked.  total brilliance.  so they win.  This is life baby.  If we pull together we will be unstopable.  People may push us, but nothing will happen if we are all together.  They may penatrate, but they will not score.  So now as we enter High School i urge you to pull together an not get demolashed and we can do the demolishing
