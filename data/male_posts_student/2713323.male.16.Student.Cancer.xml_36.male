Im basically here to check out more about this blog...and i found out that i cant place a background music!! Simply, because i have to pay for it. The irony ahh!! Plus, i found a great track on powerwebmusic, thanks to hui...it was kickstart my heart by motley crue. DOH. Neeways i figured that i didnt write an entry yesterday so yea, i'll make it up. Recess is going to be over in 15 mins so i have to be quick. Hmm...went to macs at siglap with jon and the others...ate, came home and quickly tried to sleep because i had tution at 6.30 and it was like, 5 already...woke up at 6.25, felt damn wasted, and the tutor came, ON TIME. God damn, he taught me physics, covered 3 chapters. After which i went to watch the oscars and yadayada...waited for my supper...till 11.30 and i so tired that i went to sleep. School so far today was cool...double free period cos of chinese...which was damn boring. I felt sleepy but i could'nt sleep, wonder why. We had P.E after that i played a little bit of tug-of-war and soccer...the usual. E maths which i did nothing and Mr Ng did nothing cept for go through some questions, and here i am. Recess. Sheesh theres a physics test after my art today which ends at like 3.30 so i have to stay here for another hour to complete the bloody test, and leave at 4.30. I so bored now...so hungry too...theres double period Chemistry after this where there might be a test, but lets just pray that there will none, and hold hands and skip after.
