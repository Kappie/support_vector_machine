You should know by now that tomorrow is my 18th birthday.  I just hope nobody will make a big deal of it at school tomorrow.  You’re probably wondering why I’m telling you this.  Well, I have a feeling that something truly special is going to happen tomorrow.  I know, I must sound crazy, just like the other times that I’ve felt like this and it never happened, but something’s different this time.  I can’t describe it, and it just makes my head hurt to find out how, but I hope it will be for the better. 	I think I’ve worried about the future long enough.  As they say, you can’t live life with your head in the clouds, so I’ll just take things one step at a time, just like I always do.  I guess I can always count on the present to be there for me, so I won’t let anything stop me from having a good day tomorrow.  Good night!      Jan      It was Monday as Janet Wilson read over her latest diary entry once again.  She tossed her long brown ponytail over her shoulder as she lay on her queen-size bed, holding the blue-bound, custom gold-lettered book open in her hands.  She couldn’t help reading the lines, written in a metallic blue ink, over and over, despite the fact that she had told her diary that she wouldn’t morose over the issue.  She tried to think of other things, but always found herself coming back to the diary, in which she only wrote the most important events of her life.  Her bright, blue eyes were still transfixed on the page and she wasn’t sure why she couldn’t stop thinking about it; something was just nipping at the back of her mind and she had know to find out what it was, but how?    Then she remembered her calculus homework, which she had better get started on soon, because it was already 6 o’clock.  As she got up to dig into her blue, vinyl-lined backpack, something new caught her attention in the mirror for a split-second, and she stopped for a while.  She looked into the mirror at various angles, trying to reenact the way she had passed it before, but it didn’t happen again.  Then she noticed that the change was actually in her self-perception.  Behind the few freckles that dotted her face beside her nose and her piercing blue eyes, there was a new sort of elegance that she couldn’t quite describe.  She removed her navy blue hair tie, letting her hair fall down about to her waist and her mouth opened slightly.    Perhaps this elegance was simply the feeling one gets when they’ve known someone forever and yet, something new, exciting and beyond your conceivable interest is there.  Then Janet realized something else, although not nearly for the first time; everything was blue.  Her cute little blouse, her slightly-faded denim jeans, her socks, the shoes she’d picked out at Kohl’s, the bedspread, the pillows, the diary, the pen, her bag; the list could go on for an eternity.  Even the walls were painted a light shade of blue, before the family had even moved into house.  Maybe it was some matter of destiny.  Destiny is such a powerful word in itself, the word that determines the very purpose of an individual’s existence.  A word so powerful that even fate must bend to its constant will, for fate may change the path, but it can never change the destination.  Hence, the reason for the form of the word, destiny, and that was it.    That was the powerful, gripping emotion that quelled inside of Janet Wilson on her not-usually-so-fantastic eighteenth birthday.  Today was not just another birthday with cake, candles, jokes and a few presents.  Today a critical event would come that would guide her toward her true destiny unknown.  As the thought had left her head, it was replaced with the cruelest image of irony she had probably seen in her life; a scene where she and her family went out to dinner late and as they sat down at a table, the man of her dreams walked by.  How she gazed at him with the utmost passion, until he pulled out a gun and told her to stop staring at him and when the gun fired, a sound like a large bubble bursting reverberated inside of her head and she was tossed back into reality.    ‘No.  That wasn’t even close.  Besides, the guy killed me anyway,’ Janet thought to herself resolutely, but still a bit heart-stricken nevertheless.  She forced herself to smile and laugh at the whole incident as she pulled out her rather ponderous mathematics text and heaved it onto the blue bedspread that depicted rolling ocean waves.  She took her pencil in her left hand and set it to the paper, when her eyes fell on the complex formulas that covered the opposite page of her book, and she remembered just how much math made her sick from time to time.  It was definitely not that she didn’t understand it, although calculus in itself was difficult to grasp.  In fact, Janet usually did very well with her math courses; they just made her crazy if she wasn’t in the right mood, and her mind was still on whatever was supposed to happen today.    By the time she had finished the first problem, which spanned over nearly a fourth of the page, it became too stressful for her at the present time.  Whenever Janet became stressed, a nice cool shower was the best solution, well for her anyway.  It could help her focus or just let her take a load off and not worry about so many things, and in this situation it was probably the answer to both of those problems.  And so she picked out another easily matching blue outfit and took it across the silent hall and into the bathroom.  Her parents wouldn’t be home until about eight.  They worked a late ten-hour dayshift or an early swingshift, however you might put it, from 9 to 7:30.  Janet thought it was interesting that they both worked at the same complex, but almost never saw each other all day.  Actually, it sounded kind of sad, now that she thought about it, and she only got to see them later at night and early in the morning before she walked to school.  She really missed them sometimes…    Janet glanced in the mirror rather timidly as she pulled her pale blue top over her head.  She instinctively blushed, self-consciously, as most anyone would trying to look their best for themselves.  She was about five-nine with a small frame, a lean and slender build and quite a fair complexion.  She was sometimes late to her classes in the few recent years, and since then she’d made a habit of wearing a watch on her right wrist.  She pulled a couple clean towels from the cupboard there and stepped into the shower.  She hadn’t noticed that she had forgotten to remove her watch before getting in the shower until the alarm she had set went off, reminding her of the exact time of her birth; 6:22.  It was just one of those things that one almost does without thinking, setting a watch for such a precise time to commemorate a special event.  She just smiled and turned it off, but as she bent over to place it by the shower door where it wouldn’t get wet, she froze.  As the beads of cool water softly rained upon her face, something very strange began to happen to her.  >                                  A blaze of potential the ocean doth hold, A powerful motive when tamed and controlled. Still lies in a darkness so bleak and so cold, But soon shall its purpose begin to unfold.
