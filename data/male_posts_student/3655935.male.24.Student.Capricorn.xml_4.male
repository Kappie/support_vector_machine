I’m not an unattractive human being.  My personality is not utterly repulsive.  I’m a great guy who just hasn’t met that beautiful, intelligent, funny, Christian lady who   also   likes me.  In order to hasten things along their natural course, I believe my best option would be to create a reality show where a variety of eligible ladies compete for my affections on national television.  Sounds like a win-win scenario to me.  Actually, upon little reflection, I see this is a terrible idea.  I guess I will just have to do things the old fashioned way.   Uuuurrrgghh....
