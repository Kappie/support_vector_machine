I guess that could mean better bloggin'  Anyways yesterday was a long day.  Pretty boring too.  Game @ Xavier we ended up winning by 2.  I'm glad we won because we got a technical for a very stupid reason.  That combined with the fact that we almost got a second one because the coaches were arguing the call of the first one.  Wow.  I'm just glad we won after all that.  I played alright, but not great.  A couple points but I missed a few free throws.  I guess it's not that bad because we still won the game.  Blah blah.  School is no fun sometimes.  Yeah that time is about now.  I want to go home and sleep at the moment but no I can't.  w00t?!
