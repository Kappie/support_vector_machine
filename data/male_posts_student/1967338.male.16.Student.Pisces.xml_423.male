Anyway, I just want to say that I am oblivious to Hall Sweeps because I have a press pass!  I am awesome!  I do like the protest idea, but I think instead of doing it I'll put on my press pass and interview people about it.  Protestors always like to be in the paper. Anyway, I need to go to bed so I will make a real update later.  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.
