Yes, and I did intentionally use REVERSE. Or perhaps adverse would be more fitting....  I don't know why, but it fuckin does.   What is life's quest, life's meaning? Matty says procreation. Every being on this earth exists solely for procreation. To facilitate what? MORE PROCREATION. Bugs breed so they can feed the frogs. Frogs breed so they can feed the snakes. Snakes breed so they can feed the eagles. Eagles breed to keep the population in check, allowing for more...you guessed it...PROCREATION. We exist solely to spread our seed.  So yes, to all you nay-sayers out there, life IS all about boys and girls and falling in love, and something or other involving birds and bees. BaHAHA!  The cause was lost somewhere in translation, and now we just exist in effect, searching, and endlessly searching.  I'm not pessimistic, I KNOW what's going to happen. And that is SO not the same thing. Totally.  Well, I better go find myself a suitable mate, preferrably one that will devour my head and lay her eggs inside of my carcass. Ah, love at first sight.   You know, me fellow buddies in AA have a little prayer, and it goes somethin like a this:   "God, grant me the serenity,   To accept the things I cannot change;   The courage to change the things I can,   And the wisdom to know the difference."   Now, the thing about serenity is it is not exactly existing in an environment totally without chaos, as that is impossible. Entropy exists no matter where, when, or who you are. Chaos is the human stain. Serenity is being able to cope and to exist within this chaos, without having it destroy you.   I don't know what all these fans of mine are raving about. I'm hardly in tact.  I don't really have a choice otherwise.  We will rise.
