Namely, with the  urlLink politically motivated crimes  receiving much  urlLink harsher  sentences. Granted, it seems reasonable to punish a man for burning other people's property, but giving him a sentence that is almost 3 times as long as rape or attempted murder for a property crime in which he  was careful not to harm anyone  is definitely unreasonable. Jim Luers' story is old news (still a pressing issue; he's been in prison for 4 years and has 18 to go), but it's still happening with activists all over, like the artist being accused of bioterrorism for an anti-war project and a slew of others.   Also, I just stumbled upon this  urlLink frightening shit  on  urlLink Infoshop :  " Jeanne Lenzer  New York  A sweeping mental health initiative will be unveiled by President George W Bush in July. The plan promises to integrate mentally ill patients fully into the community by providing "services in the community, rather than institutions," according to a March 2004 progress report entitled New Freedom Initiative (www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/newfreedom/toc-2004.html). While some praise the plan's goals, others say it protects the profits of drug companies at the expense of the public.  Bush established the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health in April 2002 to conduct a "comprehensive study of the United States mental health service delivery system." The commission issued its recommendations in July 2003. Bush instructed more than 25 federal agencies to develop an implementation plan based on those recommendations.  The president's commission found that "despite their prevalence, mental disorders often go undiagnosed" and recommended comprehensive mental health screening for "consumers of all ages," including preschool children. According to the commission, "Each year, young children are expelled from preschools and childcare facilities for severely disruptive behaviours and emotional disorders."  Schools, wrote the commission, are in a "key position" to screen the 52 million students and 6 million adults who work at the schools.  .... Dr Darrel Regier, director of research at the American Psychiatric Association (APA), lauded the president's initiative and the Texas project model saying, "What's nice about TMAP is that this is a logical plan based on efficacy data from clinical trials."  He said the association has called for increased funding for implementation of the overall plan.  But the Texas project, which  promotes the use of newer, more expensive antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs, sparked off controversy when Allen Jones, an employee of the Pennsylvania Office of the Inspector General, revealed that key officials with influence over the medication plan in his state received money and perks from drug companies with a stake in the medication algorithm (15 May, p1153). He was sacked this week for speaking to the BMJ and the New York Times.   The Texas project started in 1995 as an alliance of individuals from the pharmaceutical industry, the University of Texas, and the mental health and corrections systems of Texas. The  project was funded by a Robert Wood Johnson grantâ€”and by several drug companies ."  I don't like this. I can smell through the bullshit public interest rhetoric. This project reeks of lost liberties and government spying, not too mention pork barelling. I think this calls for a big  WTF?!?!!!!111one
