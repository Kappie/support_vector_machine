I mean I've know the man for 17 years on Monday, and it really worries me to say I feel I know him, and I would feel comfortable talking to him as I would if a random hobo walked up to me on the street. I'm not saying he's a horrible person, he's a nice guy and an awesome father, but we never really seemed to click as people. Oh well clash of personalities I guess.  Nehoo I went to a looong philosophy lecture today at Goldalming college, and it felt like hell honestly, all apart from the Aprils fools joke that happened at the beginning.   I'm knackered though so I'll see you later xBuBzx
