Finally, three days after the jog, the soreness is gone! Time to do it again.  :-)   I am working on a new Bodyforlife-style program, which I am currently attempting to implement. I kind of started it this week, though I did make some missteps. Still, forge ahead! Today I bought www.PrimalEloquence.com -- it's from a choral piece, and it refers to music's effect on the soul, but I think it works just as well as a description of a fit body. I'll wax more about that when the site is up, probably next week.  And now... okay, Frith asked me to get dinner at the greek restaurant. I know I could eat healthy there but I will probably end up sampling the pastitsio.  Hehe...  as long as I keep getting regular exercise though, this should be able to fit into my plan. Will keep you posted.
