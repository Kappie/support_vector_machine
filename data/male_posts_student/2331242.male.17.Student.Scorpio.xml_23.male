       
      I close my eyes and I keep seeing things Rainbow waterfalls Sunny liquid dreams Confusion creeps inside me raining doubt Gotta get to you But I don't know how Call me call me Let me know it's alright Call me call me Don't you think it's 'bout time Please won't you call and Ease my mind Reasons for me to find you Peace of mind What can I do To get me to you
