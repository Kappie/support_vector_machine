Basically, i am really tired, have no idea what is going on at times in my life, all i have is 1 clear focus right now, besides studying i mean... and that is of course, with regards to Kelly lah... not that much is happening, but of course, i do wish that things would go well...  Anyway, why do i sound so sian today?! Well, cause, i really feel sian today! man, it's like, Chapel was the only thing that i was happy with... i mean... besides receiving a message from Kelly lah... haha... that, was another matter altogther! haha... but, let's just say, i was damn happy! haha... ok... anyway, the whole day was so monotonous, things went on like they usually do, nothing much interested me except the occasional gossips, scandals that were going on around... haha... i sound like a girl right? Can't help it lah, just damn bored at times lah!  Oh well, work is getting heavier as the days go by, and i seriously need to get down to my acadamic stuff lah! If not, i am really chopped liver! heex... ;p Somehow or another though, i can't seem to get my spirits up unless i see Kelly or get a message from her, but how often is that?! haha... ok, i seriously sound like some lovelorn person and even Yong Xi said that i was some love sick puppy! Is it that obvious that i really miss her so much? i hope not leh... it seems as if, she has become the epitome of my happiness and joy... the center of my life...  ok... yeah well, i really am feeling quite tired right now, and just got home not very long ago! haha... Finally heard from Chun Yan lah! Wah, he missing from action like don't know how long liao lah! So nice to hear from him again and nice to know that he cares! haha... ;p oh well... but anyway, i really miss some people or rather, wish that i could like hang out with some friends that i haven't been hanging out with much recently... but, we'll see how it goes in time to come lah...  till next time though, i am going to study hard, work hard and basically... just... keep trying and waiting for you know who lah! heex... ok... take care every one and keep smiling! ;p
