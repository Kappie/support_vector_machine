We do camp stuff.  I enjoy it.  I am very tired at the end of the day, but it only hits once the kids are in bed.  Or at least with lights out.    A fantastic rainstorm tonight.  I rarely love rain like I do tonight...usually it's just rain, and I'm near a storm drain or something, but tonight, at camp, feeling inspired and nostalgic and alive like I used to all the time and like I hope I can get back to, it's wonderful.  I stood in it for a minute, just basking.  I'd love to fall asleep in it.
