Still, something is unsettling about them. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it has something to do with their Doubleshot. All it has in it is an espresso, cream, milk, and caramel color. What the hell gives it energy? I smell whiskey...   I just realized how dumb all this is, sorry for the inconvenience.   Go America...........I'm already sick of writing these America things........
