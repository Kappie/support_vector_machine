Due to my parents generosity and understanding of my needs, they let me bring my comp and I spent most of the time playing my favorite game: Morrowind.  But time I didn't spend on the PC, I was listening to music.  It's strange, my tastes went from Techno, to Heavy Metal, to Video Game Remix in just one week.  I also got a lot of writing done.  I finally overcame a writer's block I had in my biggest series Twin Planet, created a sequel/crossover of three of my stories I'm probably gonna call Black Saga until I think up a better one.  It's just a filler name but those tend to grow on you, why else would I have a series called Twin Planet?  It's probably the stupidest title I've come up with yet it's still my favorite.  I also overcame several writer's blocks that came up in a nameless crossover story I'm writing with Noizchild, I'm proud of what I have, even if it's only about three pages, which isn't much to show for a week.  But like I said, Morrowind was over 50% of my time. I got farther than I ever had, realized I killed someone I shouldn't have early on and started over, got as far as I was before and then some.  I love that game.
