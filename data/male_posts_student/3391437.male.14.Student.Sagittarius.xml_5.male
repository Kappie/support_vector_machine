I am from the country of mountains, country of diverse ethnic groups, country of rich cultures and most importantly the country of my ancestors which is Nepal. It is the place where my ancestors grew and worked off their sweats and blood so they could provide a living for their family. I am proud to be of the grandson of those people. Taking about my early childhood, I used to enjoy hunting birds. Slingshots were bought from the cities and taken to the villages where I could find a huge area for hunting. Hunting was one of my favorite hobby, sport or whatever you like to call it. “One feels such an excitement and energy going through his body when he/she is really close to the enemy and is about to face it.” One of my quotes which I have used to motivate and keep track of my mind from going some other place. “Killing bird is not right. What has the bird done to you, why do you want to kill innocent creature?” One of the many expressions that left my mom’s mouth in my childhood. Even though my mom everyday used to remind these words to me, I never listened to her. I was a killer.
