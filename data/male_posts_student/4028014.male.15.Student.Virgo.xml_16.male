I've made some important decisions today which may affect my character in future...  Hmm... Let see... Well, last time i would consider my friends as my top priority... I'm sorry to say but its now between second or third... Its my family that's is really important to me now... They need me and vice versal... True, you might think that its normal that everyone treats their families as top priority... But not me... I'm just abnormal... I'm a very negative thinking person and imagine all those people who don't... Well, that's me!  And from now on, i'll no longer tolerating other people's temper... I believed its time for me to show mine... Yea... That's right... So sorry, but i am really frustrated with the life i've not... What's more when i am going to take this major exam, every problem came out... I'm just a fifteen year old teenager, and i don't think i deserve this kind of treatment while most of the teenagers out there are having fun... I really wished that i was born to a rich family where by i can have things i want and live life without worries... Yea... But too bad... I was born to the opposite kind of family that i want... Still, they are the ones who brought me up and continue to give me education when they were in financial crisis... Though i kept demanding for money to buy some things which were not really important to me at the time when they were not earning much, they would still gave in and give me the money... I still remembered that it was my 13th birthday, when i received a call from my parent saying that they might not be able to celebrate my birthday as they have to work longer to earn more money.  Feeling disappointed, i put down the phone and went to bad early... Soon i was in the dream land when a sudden jerk woke me up... It was around 2300 when my mother wake me out, one hand holding my birthday cake. I was so surprised that they would buy one for me... I was so touched when they said that they came back late so as to earn more money to buy my cake... Though its small, but it is definately one of the sweetest things they had given me..   Thinking of that, i felt really stupid... I actually took them for granted, finding them very naggy this days and all sorts of things... From now on i promised that i would treasure them really really well...  As for friends, i do realised that my past thinkings were not totally right... Yes, friends are important, but it got to depend on what type of friend you have... As for me, its a combination of good and bad, with temper and without... All sorts... What i prefer to be my good friends is those who are able to tolerate with me and don't have temper at all or at least seldom show it to others!!! Yea... One good example is Pin Wen... He is really a good guy to be friend with... Really, i am really honoured to have him as my friends...  Well, maybe i will continue this blog tomorrow, or i might changed to other if i realised that there is nothing left much to elaborate... One things... Whatever i am going to do to those people whom i detest, i'm not going to go easy on them... I honestly hope that i would not see you guys again after graduateed from this school!!! Take it as a cursing if you guys want... But normally what i've cursed would come through... Probility of coming true is 2/3... So don't mess with me!!!  That's all i've got to say... Yea... Have a nice evening and sweet dreams!!!  Quote of the day (from Harry Potter): "There you go, Harry! You won't being thinck after all -- You were just showing moral fiber!"  Love Louis
