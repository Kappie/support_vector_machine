I have tried...but failed, I probly took no for an answer. Well I wont let this get me down again. I hated being depressed and sad, and I hated fighting for something that I cant win over. It was her choice to do this, she says it was for the best. As i take my path of shame and revival of life, I hope i will come upon happiness...the happiness that i have been missing for so long. Tune in to what the future reveals in the life of a defeated fighter, in his quest for a chance...the saga continues
