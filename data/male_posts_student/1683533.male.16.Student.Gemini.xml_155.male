The bad thing is that I need to put all the links back there, if i can remember them -_-'. So, I will be fiddling around alot with this...  Other news: band is slow, havent practiced in awhile, Evan is on vacation and I got grounded.  Hopefully this week I can sit down with Brandon and write some trombone parts, and work on new songs, we are ditching alot of the old.  There have been a number of school band concerts, I'm am growing weary of band, I really dont like the warm-ups we do everyday, but hey, its an easy A.  Persuasive speech on tuesday...Im not even sure what I am gonna do mine on yet >_  School is almost over, god I want it to end.
