Perspective, means, of course, that something far, far worse and far, far funnier happened to the Glennis on Monday Night. This is second hand, so don't shoot the messenger here kids, but I've got it on good authority that it's pretty accurate.  We have a chip display. Not for microchips or memory chips, but for chips of the corn and potato variety. A veritable temple of carb-evil. A satanic alter to Humpty Dumpty and the Muchie gang.  Glennis was governing the floor (he doesn't manage it, he governs it... WITH AN IRON FIST!!! ... ahem). So some lads, looking glassy eyed and smiling like the GST had just been repealed are loitering. They firmly grasp both sides of the display and hoist it into the air. They march directly from the store and begin cramming it in their car. The Glennis is shell shocked - a customer comes up to him from outside and hands him a bag of chips and says "Aren't you going to stop them?"  This apparently triggers some sort of Stupor-Hero reflex in our duh-tagonist. He races out to seize the villains... as they drive away... in their car... with.... NO LICENSE PLATES.  BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!  Oh, the comedy. I can barely breathe.  Apparently he called the cops and speculated that they might be on drugs. To which the cop allegedly replied "They stole an entire display full of potato chips and doritos and you *THINK* they  MIGHT  be on drugs?? Shocker man. Shocker."  It'll take me a while to get over the raw humour that is this one.  Maybe Glennis should be a security guard.
