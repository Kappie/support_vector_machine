For pirates, there is not Polly-want-a-cracker Nursing Home.  No, retired pirates go and cut down Cacti trees, the bane of most horticulturists.  Only the fearsome task of scathing the monstrototies known as the cactus can be entrusted to the fearsome pirates of an age long gone.  But the fate that fell upon a certain seasoned pirate is so gruesome, that it must be told.  There was a pirate his name long forgotten, who was contracted to remove one of these monoliths of spikes and pricks. Many a pirate would never leave their cabins without the right kind of specialised equipment. To do so would be as perilious as wrestling a 50-foot kraken. But this pirate whose name was long forgotten approached the task appointed ill equiped. He was up against the forces of nature. Bless his soul.  To cut this solemn tale short, the pirate ended up with spikes and pricks in places that were never meant to have spikes and pricks. The price that he paid will be discussion for every tavern from here to the end of the world.  WIth spikes in his eyes, the poor pirate required a patch covering his maimed eye. Rumour has it that it sparked the fashion that had pirates from here to the Madagascar Islands wearing the same patch over their eye. Hands swollen and blistered from pricks told of hardship endured. Clothes rendered useless were burnt.   T'is a sad tale indeed.  Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhhhh
