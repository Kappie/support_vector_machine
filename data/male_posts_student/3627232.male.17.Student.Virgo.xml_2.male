(little robot)   Ladies and gentlemen (if I can say that), I would like to take a moment to make a small tribute to a very great and comical cartoon known as   Invader Zim  . This cartoon is just so hilarious, I can barely begin to describe it. It's almost as random as my overall thought patterns.  Invader Zim is about an alien of the "Irkon" race. They are a race of aliens that basically invade other planets. Some planets include the planet of the largest most comfortable couch in the universe, or the planet of the man eating rats. Zim, a reject of his people, is selected to go on a "special mission" merely because he screwed up the last invasion. Zim's mission is to take over a planet thought to not exist, but much to the "Tall Ones" surprise, Zim ends up on Earth. Before leaving, he is given his S.I.R. (I forget what it stands for, it's been a while), however, Zim's is made out of a broken one from the garbage, and the brain is made using a screw, some gum and some string. It springs to life and calls itself G.I.R. . . . and it's a complete moron.  While on Earth, Zim encounters the one person who believes aliens exist, his name is Dib. The whole show is basically Zim and Dib trying to foil each other as Zim tries to take over the Earth.  This show was banned from TV a while ago because it was "To violent for children." However, some channels still put it on. If you have the Nick-toons channel then you should be able to watch it, or you could try and find it using some form of downloading utility, such as K-Lite (because Kazaa is for suckas).  Watch the show or go to hell . . . I'm sorry, that was uncalled for. Watch the show or go to hell, please.
