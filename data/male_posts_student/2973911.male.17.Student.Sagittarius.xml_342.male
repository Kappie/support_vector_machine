I'll entitle it 'What is Love?' and I'll survey about a hundred or so people and let them answer the question as short or as long as they want and them let visitors comment on the main question or the answers or even the comments. What do you think? A moneymaker or moniker?  As for Dream Interpretation, how do you propose to find out what your dream really means?
