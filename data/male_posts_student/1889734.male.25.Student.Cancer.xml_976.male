"They went into Iraq in a brilliant military strategy, which we all adopted and supported, but they didn't have a plan to win the peace. They didn't bring other [countries] to our side. They didn't give our troops all the equipment - the body armor and the armored Humvees and things they need and deserve."   'Other countries'?  I guess England is now one of our colonies.  Did France and Germany merge under the new title Other Countries?  Interesting...   Kerry: I can guarantee that … within my first term, I will have a substantial reduction in troops [in Iraq], yes.  Stripes: Is 17,000 [troops] enough in Afghanistan?  Kerry: No.  Stripes: Would you put more Americans in there first? While your diplomacy works?  Kerry: No, I’d like to expand the NATO presence there, and I’d like to expand other countries’ involvements. But I do think that this administration is diverting from the real war on terror, which was in Afghanistan against al-Qaida, to Iraq, and I think it’s cost us dearly.   France already vetoed NATO presence in Afghanistan.  Is Kerry just going to ask nicer?   Stripes: Increasing end strength, even the 40,000 soldiers that you’re talking about, that takes time. We have a readership of young troops in the field right now, and I think they want to know what you’re going to do immediately to help their situation.  Kerry: I will seek a much greater level of both NATO and other-nation involvement in the training of Iraqi troops and Iraqi security [forces]. We’ll provide greater Iraqi security on the ground and reduce the burden on our own troops … so it’s not an American occupation. And that will greatly reduce the risk to the soldiers in Iraq.   Uh, France also vetoed using NATO to train Iraqi troops.  Again, ask nicer?  I thought our policy wouldn't be held hostage to other nation's interests?  Elect Kerry - because the French will listen to him?
