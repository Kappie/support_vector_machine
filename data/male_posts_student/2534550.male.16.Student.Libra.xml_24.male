As expected the rookies did FANTASTIC for their first time...haha i remember the good ol days when i came in halfway through and everyone else already knew how to do everything....i was so lost but at least the rookies will get lots of practice. Chelsea and me were talking about just how good the rookies have it since they dont have to go through daily 9-9s. Lucky punks just wait till tour where we're stuck on a bus for 20 hours (ah memories) and Omid bustin out the Gold Bond.....and Axe (that was me). well im done you guys go back to your daily life...unless you're a bari..cuz then you gotta go practice more! MORE PUSHUPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
