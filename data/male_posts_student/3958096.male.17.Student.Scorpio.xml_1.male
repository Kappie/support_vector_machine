It reminds me of a quote I once read, from Epidicus'  Disappointment  - "It is a bitter disappointment when you have sown benefits, to reap injuries." I try to be a good person, to help those in need, to be as altruistic as possible, thinking that maybe in the distant future I can attain happiness at last. But that, I've finally figured out, will never happen. It's a liberating thought, really. Once you stop yourself from trying to realize the impossible, to make life something that it isn't, you can see it for what it truly is - a means to an end. A conversation I had with a friend might be able to better describe the situation. We were discussing the impossibility of space travel, that is, visiting other inhabited planets and communicating with other sentient species. Pretty much all of science fiction is based on the premise that faster-than-light-speed travel is possible. But it's not, not according to the top quantum physicists of our day, including Dr. Michio Kaku (author of  Hyperspace . In theory, if any matter was accelerated to 100% the speed of light, it would be converted into pure energy. To sustain travel at this speed would consume all of the energy in the universe. Poof. Nothingness. What then? Maybe that's how our universe started to begin with. Idiot scientists, under the guise of unraveling the truth of the universe, discovered a way to travel at the speed of light and ironically unraveled the universe iteself. Then BOOM, the Big Bang, and our universe came into being out of the remaining singularity of theirs. Who knows how many times this may have happened? Are we universe 1, 1000, or 1 billion? Of course, I'm probably wrong. And everyone else is probably wrong as well. The one absolute truth in the universe is that we will never know the truth. Perhaps the search for truth, religious, scientific, or otherwise gives people hope. Even I consider myself a Christian. I, like billions of others on Earth, want desperately to believe that there is a greater purpose. But faith just isn't enough anymore, not in a world where wars ravage continents, disease slaughters countless millions, and George Bush is allowed to be the president of an entire nation. And so, I choose to push on with the knowledge that knowledge is ephemeral. Life begins, fades, and eventually ends. What we make of our lives matters a great deal because of our ability to comprehend our existence. But after we die, what remains to do the comprehending?
