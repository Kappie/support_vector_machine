I had a bit of a headache over breakfast, but nothing too bad, so didn't think anything more of it. Got a lift to school, feeling a bit worse when I got there. I was called into the exam, sat down, headache now getting quite bad. I decided to grin and bear it (ok, I didn't grin, I wouldn't want one of the teachers to think there was something wrong with me, but I did try to bear it) I was ok for the first 2 questions or so, but then something deadful happened... I came over all hot... heavy breathing... headache getting worse... felt like vommiting... stomache contracted... and nothing came out. Luckily. Sat there for a few minutes trying to recover, and went back to answering the question. Still feeling fairly bad, but not quite as much as before, I did about half of the paper. And then it happened again...came over all hot... heavy breathing... well, you know the story. I was seriously thinking of leaving the exam, but I didn't. After about another 4 minutes, I seemed to recover a bit, and went back to answering the exam. But I was writing awfully slowly, and my hand was shaking slightly. Didn't even get on to answering the last question (which turned out to be a 12 mark one) and I did about half of the penultimate one.  2)It was also the worst exam so far, because there was so much of it. 12 mark, 9 mark. 12, 12, 12, 9, 4, 12, 12, 9 etc. And that went on for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Although, I didn't find any question particually difficult, knowing at least a few points for each.   Anyway, as soon as I got out of the exam room into the open air, I felt almost perfectly fine, with only a slight nagging headache. Waited about half an hour with my friends  urlLink Deutsches  and someone called Nick, whilst we waited for another person named Tom, who had extra time for some reason. Then we proceeded to walk home.  I also had a biology extension exam yesterday, which I was going to blog about after it had finished, but I didn't get round to it. Thinking it was going to be dangerously hard, after seeing stuff about genetic fingerprinting, ribosomes and messenger and transfer RNA in the revision guide, I was actually a bit worried, having not learnt that hard stuff, but it turned out to be quite easy, the only question I had no idea of being 'Name 2 scientists involved in developing vacines'. I named Dalton and Harvery, but after a quick Encarta check at home, turned out to be wrong. Dalton was an atomic physist and Harvey discovered blood circulaiton. The correct answer should have been Jenner and Flemming. Oh well, it was only 2 marks.  Getting home today after business, I had a bit to eat (crisps and water to drink) and watched Star Wars Episode V video, which I must say is a great film, but not as good as VI or II. After that, feeling more hungry, I had an abysmal attempt at cooking a fried egg on toast, which I thought would be easy. It wasn't. It looked more like scrambled egg with flattened into a pulp. Also nearly ruined the frying pan too. The toast wasn't done properly either, as I toasted the bread straight from the freezer, not wanting to cut the fresh bread, or wait for this one to thaw out. Therefore I decided to have a peanut butter sandwhich instead :)    Weather Very cloudy, quite warm. Partly sunny earlier.  Reading:  Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban. I'm not going to achieve my target, am I?  Listening to:  Monty Python CD - I Like Chinease  Watching:  Star Wars V - The Empire Strikes Back  Confused about:  Product Diversification  Annoyed with:  Illness  Mood:  Not too bad
