What happened is I was in the living room watching TV, and the Lakers were playing a game and were totally kicking the Pistons ass. However, the location of the game was in the gym at my old elementary school. Not to mention that, besides Shaq and Kobe, the only players in the game were teenagers.  The dream started getting strange when the next thing I knew was that I was in the game playing for the Lakers. There was a problem however, and it was that I suck at basketball like there's no tomorrow.  When it came for my turn to get the basketball, I couldn't grab hold of it because the ball was bouncing too much. Everyone in the crowd was laughing at me.  Is this a prophecy that might come true someday?  No, obviously not. Not because the game was on the gym in my elementary school, but because the Lakers were beating the crap out of the Pistons. We all know that's never going to happen if the Lakers don't pull their heads out of their cocky asses, which they seem to have trouble doing.
