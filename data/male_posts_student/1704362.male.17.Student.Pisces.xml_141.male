An advasary has come upon us! To the catupults!" to the modern definition of "Please grease up my penis."   Old : Bartholomew, the dastardly barbains are attacking!  Foe Shizle mine nizle!    New : Bitch step up!  Fo shizzle my nizzle!       2   - An urban slang rendering of a common phrase in real estate, "For Sale By Owner."  " Fo' Shizzle My Nizzle:   3 bedroom, 2 bath cape cod in desirable neighborhood. Close to schools, parks, and shopping. Asking $149,900."  request for deletion of definition from rancidmonkey:"This definition could not be correct. Real Estate agents, urban or otherwise, would never use slang to advertise. The meaning is also too formal to ever be used in everday conversation, such a word rendered in slang would be."
