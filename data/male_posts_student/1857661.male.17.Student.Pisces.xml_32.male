I'm just so fortunate to have her as my assistant.   ~  urlLink May Yenn  was talking about being herself. Therefore, she's becoming a bit sarcastic sometimes.  ~ Inez is back! She now looks like Christina from Form 4. Everyone says that and she's getting annoyed by it!  ~ Had a great time during Commerce class. There was only 9 students in the class after lunch. Others were involved with the cheerleading (practice or decorations).     Yes. The badges that I have so far. The top one is the Interact Name Tag. The monitor badge is on the bottom left while the right one shows the prefect badge.
