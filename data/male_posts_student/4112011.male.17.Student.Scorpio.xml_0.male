LIfe.. is this what it is all about?! oh well.. not much i could do right? Lucky for me i have a jeijei who i know would be by my side... Last night was scary. I practically cried the whole night thinking that i've lost jeijei.. that was really scary. i dont want anything like that to happen. Hayyyyy....  who's new.. tina... and there's rus... pero like the rest they're expected to go away. i dotn care. i have jei jei naman eh.:)   Teth is now with sportz.. hahah.. i have no idea who she is... sportz is pretty good looking. never really loved teth anyway.. wel i thought i did. pero mostly it was just about lust and wanting to OWN someone. hmm.. so didnt suffer that much from that.. expect of course for finacial ouches! ahahaha...  Im in the library. i like writing my journal here. Its quiet here noone can bother u. no one... except for your own self. is that another somebody bah? maybe..
