Oh, my sis' rabbit died :(...she was just gone one morning, and there was a hole in the cage.....we thought she chewed out but...we found some brown fur in there...and snowball is all white...so we concluded that a animal chewed thru...and got her....yea....pretty gruesome...well...that rabbit was near its death anyway...it was 8...that is really old for a rabbit....but...everything dies anyways....  hmmm...i think that is it....bye...
