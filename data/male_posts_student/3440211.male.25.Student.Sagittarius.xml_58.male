It went better than usual. normally i come out of it feeling shit...  However the decission is taken and I am abiding by it. What else can I do the benefits do not really match the heart burn incurred in the past few months.  I guess I'll just have to live on for a bit and then well see how it goes.  Mood: good the week-end has landed...
