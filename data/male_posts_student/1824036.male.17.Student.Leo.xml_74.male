They started the game running the ball to my side. But I made every tackle for less than 3 yards. The rest of the game they ran the ball away from me. Never once (except on a play where they screwed up) did they run the ball to my side again. I also made 3 kickoff and 1 punt tackle. The second half we were really pumped up. We won the game with a score of (I think) 20-6. Also with time dwindling down we attempted a field goal (something the varsity cant even do) but missed barely to the left.  Our JV is 2-0 while our Varsity is 0-2...am I missing something here???  Last night the Des Moines North volleyball squad was in Fort Dodge yesterday night. Larissa (one of my friends from summer camp) goes to Des Moines North. Now instead of being 110 miles away she was a stones throw (20 miles) away. I took Jadie with me and we went up to Fort Dodge and I let Jadie and Larry (Larissa's nickname) meet. Larissa is a cool girl. I watched one of the most boring volleyball games ever. North lost in 3 games. I hope Jadie's volleyball games aren't this boring because if they are I dont know how I will ever live through going to them :S  Last night after I got home my mom came downstairs and said that the Cross Country boys were TPing (Toilet Paper-ing) our house. She told me to go yell at them. Instead I went outside and joined them.   Why would you do such a thing!!!   Well for one I only threw one roll and only one time. I let them do all the heavy damage. Plus my sister has to pick it up. HA HA HA. So I guess that is too bad for her.
