Liked this band called Nocturnal , some Helloween , Got megadeth on MP3 ;) (yay), and some assorted stuff too.  I know this for sure i have been a fool flogging a dead horse over and over , wondering where i went wrong, things happen dunno if its for the good or bad.  A misses me . wish that things atart getting better for her , i really do . havent heard from mum in 2 days . lol i guess she'll call tomorrow or today. C wouldnt miss me . been tryin notto text her . or leave her an offliner or mail her ..   as jetro tull sang   "Your life's in the gutter -- your love's in the sink"
