All of the tiles have been put up, and my dad is halfway through putting up the new ceiling. Still a lot to do though, I'll help in any way possible.  I think I have a new favourite band in Fear Factory, but I'm not sure. They have a lot more music out than Chimaira so it gives me a little more to explore, but a lot of Fear Factory's stuff sounds the same... but it's such an amazing sound. I'm just scared that I'll grow bored of it, because I now own 5 of their albums.  Anyways - went to Mandy's yesterday. As soon as I got there we both fell asleep and we were just lay there for about 4 hours listening to the same song over and over. Was nice =) and time really flew. Before we knew it Mandy had to go to work. So I went to the bus stop and she went into work. As I was waiting for my bus she sent me a nice text message so I started walking back to her work. I stayed there with her for her 5 hour shift, but halfway through I went to her house to shower. I had lots'a beer and watched the 'Top Rock Goddesses' on Scuzz when her brother come home. I felt like such a tit and left.  I stayed over at Mandy's that night. I hate it when there's no one but her brother in because we have to be really quiet all night. You can't even say anything (which was kinda unfortunate because I spoke a lot in my sleep last night)...  Anyway, she come here for a while today to read these entries and set up her own Flickr account. I'm happy we're back together but I still have really strong doubts. I don't know how long it will take before I am how I was. But I'm prepeared to wait...
