I have nothing to do, everyone is watching the game. One thing I do know is that Dunkin Donuts Vanilla Chai is overpriced, but good... oh so good... Last night I was informed of this site: urlLink Secret Diaries . It cracked me up so much.... LMAO... If anyone wants to play Yahoo pool or something IM me.   By the way, I was looking through the counter when I found that someone searched for this: http://websearch.cs.com/wm/boomframe.jsp?query=%22i% 20 need %20a%20 lover %22%20%20 gay % 20 depressed =1=0=redir? src=websearch=99bd947df7fc4a0a= 3=%22i+ need + a + lover % 22++ gay + depressed  and found or site.  WHYYYY????????? WTF???
