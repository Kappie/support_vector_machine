Okay well its been an overall good time here in Blanding, between the late night 11:00-12:00 driving around with a bunch of guys in the Expedition making stupid jokes about irish people (seriously, jokes about the irish). And chillin' with all the teens in the town just outside of "Mel's Video Store" the one and only run down shack that the citizens of Blanding affectionately call a "video store."  The only real downside to being down here is not being able to see Kensley and my friends, thats not the best, but just being down here has done exactly what i expected it to do: get my mind off things back in Farmington and just.. get away.  I had two weeks of scout camp which i can really say was an awesome thing to be a part of (i will have pics of the camp and the guys that worked with me as soon as I get back). I taught canoeing and helped out a little bit with rowing, it was really cool. I had the opportunity to help a disabled kid get his canoeing merit badge which i am really proud of, in all honesty, I think he deserved the merit badge more than half the kids that got it.  Anyways, i will try to update at least 1-2 times a week, i'll see what i can do.   Peace out Farmington.  -Shutt
