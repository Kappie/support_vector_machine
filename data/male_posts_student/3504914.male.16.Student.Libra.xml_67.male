Ah, I better write what the dream is before I forget.   Main focus of the whole dream was this girl called Ella, and the period is what I'm guessing the future (Unless we have flying cars right? More on that later). Anyways, this dream starts off with me at a party with some friends, Zio, Yoshi, and Christina. With the exception of William, these are the people I should be hanging with today. That explains why THEY were there.   But there was this other girl. You guessed it, the mystery gal called Ella. When I say she's perfect, I dead mean it. Hot as fucking hell, great body, and an amazing personality. Her face looked Eurasian, not too skinny, not too fat. She was wearing this great black flowing dress. Now, in the entire dream, only two people knew her, Christina and Arty (more on this later). Anyways, I became attracted to her in the period of one night, and when she was about to go, I asked for her address, and like in this other dream I had she said "not now". Alright, no surprise.  Then a few days later, another party, same people. This time this Ella dame and I were a lot closer, god knows why, but when the party ended, we went down in this flashy elevator. Once again, I asked for her address, and she suddenly broke down in tears. Obviously I was thinking "Wtf?" Then, as soon as the elevator doors sprung open, she started running out into a crowd of people, and when I say crowd I dead mean it, there isn’t a centimetre free of human life. So basically I chased her through the crowd, who wouldn't do this if they thought they knew the perfect person? Thing to note here it was dark and lamps on either side of the pavement were shining yellow, brightening up the night sky greatly.   Thing is, she was always at least a few metres ahead of me, so I finally gave up when we reached this breathtaking park, collapsed and pretty much yelled out "God dammit, stop running, I like you!" And she suddenly stops and turns around and replies with "God, that's not what girls want to have, we want gifts!" How surprising is this? xD Dedication of love is much less than physical presents. Anyways, I smiled at her one time, and turned and started running back for the apartment where the party was, but as I did, I bumped into Arty. And she makes mention of the fact that she knows Ella, and that she saw me chasing her, and then walks away into the crowd. Obviously I shrug this off as coincidence, and return to the building.    The next day I went to a Metro (Department store here) in the air in a bloody hovering car. Now, I was planning to get her chocolates and some jewellery, but as soon as I got out of the car, I slipped, and luckily got hold of the rim of the car, so I was hanging out of the car, with nothing below me but air. But in the name of infatuation, because that's what I think it was now I think about it in reality, I managed to get back up and immediately started running through the store looking for the exact stuff I would buy Ella.   THEN MY SISTER WOKE ME UP! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!   *sigh* Now I don't know what happened after... Chances of seeing her in my dreams again are very slim. And god do I mean she was perfect, it saddens me deeply she doesn’t exist. Now, time for analysis, because I like performing my own analyses, not trusting generalised dream interpreters.    Why I had the Dream : This I know, it’s because I talked with Christina before going to bed about why I haven’t met with a young Julia Roberts or Catherine Zeta Jones. This comes from the thought that I look like John Cusack xD And then as I was nodding off I remember thinking about meeting the perfect girl. So maybe it was that, but if it was, why would I only now have this dream? I’m sure I’ve thought of it before.   The First Meeting : Now, I know why I chose Eurasian for this girl, it’s because I find Asian-European mixes to be hot. Don’t ask why, it’s just this odd thing I figure to be true in most cases. Now, the fact she only knows Christina at the party could be a depiction of that conversation I had in real life. Now, as for her response of “not now”, this doesn’t baffle me at all. Whenever I even think about asking a girl out, I expect a negative response, whether it be going someplace or going out as a couple. The fact Ella is no different could mean she’s a representation of the girl in my head, the one that will reject you every chance they get.    Another Chance : The fact we meet again could be my brain trying to pretend that you always get a second chance. In most situations, you only get one, or so I’ve learned. The descent in an elevator rather than a winding staircase is good, because it means a straightforward solution to the problem. How do I figure this? An elevator goes from Point A to Point B in a straight line, whereas a staircase often has you turning or even when the staircase is straight you’re moving diagonally. Anyhow, when Ella starts crying after I ask her for her address again, I figure this could be telling me that persistence doesn’t always work. Dunno. The crowd, to me, represents confusion, so if Ella runs through it, it could just be that she’s amazingly bewildered, and the fact that I follow her through it makes me bewildered as well, then. The night sky being illuminated by lamps could mean this is artificial, rather than where a day sky would mean natural light. One of the reasons I therefore think I was simply infatuated with this dame.    The Pursuit : When we chase, she’s always metres away from me, out of grasp for what seems to be forever. This could mean I’m never going to find the perfect girl, or it could mean that it will just be really hard, because she does stop after I pronounce my feelings for her. The fact she tells me she wants a gift is rather odd, because I’ve always thought that women are money diggers, so this reinforces my former stated idea that Ella is your common girl. Bumping into Arty, this bit is odd because I can’t make head or tails of why I would. I won’t pretend I can figure this bit out.   The Store : Now, onto the Metro scene. I arrive in a hover car, of all things, maybe significant of my feelings being elevated. The fact I fall out could indicate that I’m just going to loose this ecstasy, but me getting back up represents that I will get it back again. Chocolates and jewellery, stereotypical gifts for a stereotypical girl, apart from the beauty that is xD Running through the department store could mean I’m trying to make choices, but I’ll never know because of being woken up.   Feel free to leave your thoughts, and yes, I did actually do all this interpreting myself. I feel some dreams mean more than others, and that to each person an object could mean another thing, thus my distrust for dream dictionaries.
