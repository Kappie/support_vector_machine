And it just ticks me off that it causes my short fused dad to well, lose his temper. And I hate when that happens.  We went to this hawker centre at Changi Village which supposedly has good food for dinner and I wasn't all happy with the idea but I went along with it anyway. And well... my dad was just showing his frustration. Won't blame him for that, cause that's how my grandfather was, but yeah. You're christian now dad... Won't you behave like one?  It just irritates me, these places known as hawker/food centres... Grr! I probably should get jogging now anyways...  Germy
