You may be more demanding than usual on the 1st, 27th and 28th, but if your date or mate doesn't want to tend to your needs on these days, there's probably someone else who will. You love to play mind games with potential love interests on the 4th, 5th and 6th, but be careful of playing hard-to-get because it may backfire. A night spent at home with your sweetie is more romantic than being wined and dined at a fancy restaurant on the 7th and 8th. You don't mind being spoiled and pampered on the 9th through 11th. You're more realistic than idealistic on the 12th and 13th, but if you use your creativity on the 18th and 19th, you should be able to silence someone who was critical of your (perceived) inability to be romantic earlier in the month. You like to push the envelope a bit when it comes to experimentation on the 22nd and 23rd, but it's extremely important not to do anything that might make your partner or date feel uncomfortable. Use the 24th, 25th and 26th to vent your frustrations or to declare your love for someone, but keep your emotions a little more reined in on the 29th through 31st.
