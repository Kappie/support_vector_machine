It's one of the best films I've seen in a while (and that includes  Mystic River , which I loved).  As a side note, I find it laughable that some  urlLink people  are complaining that Moore's film presents only his point of view.  Ebert's response to this is spot on: "Well of course it's a politically motivated film. That's allowed. President Bush's speeches are politically motivated, and he doesn't give lip service to views opposite his own. That's allowed, too."
