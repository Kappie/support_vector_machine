Nevermind. It'll teach me to be a bit more careful in the future.  I'm still feeling seedy after last night on the vodka. I have no idea how I'm going to go on my birthday. I WAS planning on going out and getting a little hammered but I think I'm over that idea now. It takes me too long to get back to feeling well again.  Got the first day of second semester tomorrow. I have a few things I need to do, such as: finding out how I can get one of my subjects turned from an 'Incomplete' to a 'passed'. I know why it's an 'I' and not a 'P'. It's because of that last assessment I handed in late. Man, I really hope I don't have to redo that subject because it'll mean that I have to do it again next year, which then means I don't head to the UK at the end of the year. Fuck. Stupid stupid stupid!! I'll go and have a talk to my tutorial lecturer and see what needs to be done. I hope it can get sorted out. Otherwise I'm fucked.  Anyways, I gotta go and get some sleep.  Talk to you all soon.   Lowman X.   "I've got to be honest,  I think you know, We're covered in lies,  And that's okay..."  Vertical Horizon - 'You're a God'
