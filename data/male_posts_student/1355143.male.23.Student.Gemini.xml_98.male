If England thinks that they have shown what is about to come they are wrong we just sucked 12-0 wouldn't had been unfair. 3 of the goals were deflections (gol de los churros) and unlucky really but England also had really good changes they blew and  scored one more goal that was ruled offside though it wasn't.  What went wrong then? Quite a few things as you can imagine but some more extreme than others.  We did in last year loose the leaders of team so we have got a quite silent defense which isn't good in team work these players are Guðni Bergson, Eyjólfur Sverrisson and Rúnar Kristinsson the last one is a midfielder but we are also lacking leaders there. Now the only leader we have is Eiður.  We didn't have enough midfielders since players playing in Norway weren't allowed to play and Brynjar did get a red card against Japan for a two footed tackle. For that reason Eiður was moved to the midfield where he doesn't work.  There are a lot of explanations but simply we played badly.  The bright points: Indriði (the left wing back) just salted Gary Neville. Eiður did get some things going but all and all sucked. Herman (the Herminator) sucked but every header against Campell he had in the game he one remember the goal A. Kristján (the first substitute) wasnt that great but just ate Joe Cole and he is the fastest MoFo around could probably out run Henry!!!  Will back to crying there will be sometime until we will do anything and we have to start looking for leaders. We had one generation with 5 but now no one.  Well I going downtown to hunt, later.
