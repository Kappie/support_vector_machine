Monggiton did not know who invented but I think he loves it. Of course, this gadget can materialize bad things like a gun or a pornographic magazine so, the inventor placed an "anti-bad-thing-materializer" that only the teacher could prevent or obstruct the materializing.   The materializing can be done inside the cubicle by putting a headgear just like the one that cyclops of x-men uses but it is only larger to fit the head. This headgear will autofit in your head but only from the forehead or only half of the head will be covered. The instruction is to think of the thing that you want and concentrate on that thing. But first, it will go in to the "main system" that the teacher can only see. So if the teacher thinks that the material the student is trying to materialize is bad, the teacher will obstuct it and warn the student that it cannot be materialize. The only items that can be materialize is the things that the instuctor embedded in the system. Maybe sometimes, there will be free time to materialize anything the student wants. This is one of the items inside the cubicle in the Digitalia.
