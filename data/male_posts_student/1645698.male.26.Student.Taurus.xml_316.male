Check it out, damn funny, but must warn...LOUD at some points.  I've still got to do these damn supps for SUNY's, they should really just go off and screw themselves. They want people to go there, but yet they make you do all this weird, unnecessary bullshit. Someday, the US'll turn communist, and we can all go and get college educations and everyone'd be smart.     Iggy Pop - The Jerk  Look, here comes the jerk !  See the guy with the fakey smile, Talkin' to my girl in a friendly style. He thinks he's quite the flirt, She'd suck a rats' dick before she'd fuck him  His brain is full of dirt, That's why the guy's a jerk, His balls are gonna burst, Thats why the guy's a jerk  Oh man you're killin' me ! Hey man you're killin' me !  He hangs out by the ladies room, His pick up line is like the voice of doom. "Hey baby do ya wanna go out with me, and by the way I make a lotta money."  His method just don't work, That's why the guy's a jerk. By the office Johnny lurks, That's why the guy's a jerk  Jerk (x11)  Oh man you're killin' me ! Hey man you're killin' me !  look here comes the jerk (x4)  His brain is full of dirt, That's why the guy's a jerk, His balls are gonna burst, That's why the guy's a jerk  (x2) Oh man you're killin' me ! Hey man you're killin me !    Hey, everyone loves pissing off other people, right? Well that lovely movie "The Passion of the Christ" has gotten every religious fanatic of Jeudo-christian religions yellin' their heads off, 'cause they say the truth is all lies. Well, to make 'em happier, I suggest that everyone hear who hasn't seen it, go add to the $117 Million its already made. That number alone shows that a few close-minded individuals can't stop artistic freedom, and most of all, facts from spreading into the mainstream.  I'm the Zenman, go Buddhism!  "I love vanilla..."
