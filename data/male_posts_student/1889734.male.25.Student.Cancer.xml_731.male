I spent the weekend at my parent's house and had some interesting conversation with my father.  His position as of last week was Abu Ghraib was the end for us, and we had lost a war that he already did not agree with.  He thought we were botching it, giving me the usual CNN litany of miserable failures and so on.    This week he was of a completely different mind.  The Nick Berg execution changed it all for him.  Now, he isn't all that concerned about Abu Ghraib, and in fact thinks the 'torture' might have been a smart thing to do.  He thinks we should escalate our involvment, and be more aggressive against al-Sadr.  He also is starting to wonder if it is even possible to coexist with Islam, but I didn't go into my position there since I frankly didn't have the energy to spend an hour ranting the contents of this Blog.  After all, it was the weekend and I was supposed to be relaxing.  While my dad isn't a representative sample, I do get the impression that many reasonable undecided people are having their attitudes hardening with the Nick Berg murder.  I hope so.
