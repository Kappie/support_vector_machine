While I like The Strokes, I would never pay more than $17 for ANY CD, unless it had decent extras. And it wasn't even like it was that new, the CD has been out for at least 10 months. I didn't understand why anyone would pay $22 for a 10-month-old CD, no matter how good the band. Then I heard an advertisement for the American Idol cell phone, and I resolved never to shop there again. Yesterday we went to CD Warehouse, a used CD store by me, and I bought Pete Yorn's  Day I Forgot , a pretty-good CD. Oh, and 2 of my Dreamcast games were too scratched to play, so I have to go back to EB tomorrow. Later!
