[ok yeah i know YOU do but i chat with you almost every day :-P ]).  So wow ummm ... last entry was the day after i talked to my cousin and aunt and other friend ....  at that time i was thinking that this past wednesday was business meeting and i could just get this all over with.i was wrong.  business meeting is the 2nd wednesday of the month which makes it this coming Wed.  So last week I went to church and sat there like a good boy pretending nothing was wrong.  One of the pastors (the one that is my uncle once removed) had been wanting to have lunch or dinner with me for a while ... just to "catch up" as he put it.  What this really means is he wants to talk about how i am doing with the gay "issue".  He already konws some of my past history ... he knows i am gay ... and knows about one particularly bad episode that happened about 6 years ago.  so we went to dinner thurs night.  it didn't go very well.  i told him that things had not really changed with the gay "issue" - that i am still attracted to guys and not to girl .. etc etc .. and he was "saddened" to hear that.  then i said that we needed to talk about something else and started on the whole subject that I don't beleive the Bible to be 100% anymore.  This got him going.  To make a long story short (I already know this post is going to be a big one) ... he argued this and that and we came to no conclusion.  He said that he wants me to sit down with him and my grandfather (one of the other pastors) and discuss this.  SIDENOTE -- I hate dentists ... I loath them ... the smell of a dentist office is just about enough to make me sick to my stomach (yes this will have some bearing on this post in a moment).  Ok I would rather go to the dentist for a root canal than sit with my grandfather and talk about all this.  It's sometimes all I can do to not go nuts just talking about the website I work on for him.  ::sigh::  Yet now here i am scheduled to meet with the two of them on Monday night. .... prepare the traquilizer ... so after i got home i was a bit upset about the whole meeting.  keep in mind that i had 3 hours of sleep the night before this and was feeling sick to my stomach ever since lunch.  I tried to call Richard and only got voice mail.  I left a message almost in tears and then just went to bed completely drianed.  i talked to Richard some this week ... well I tried to most of the week ... and actually got to some this weekend.  seems he has been going to bed very early this week and so hasn't returned my calls or messages very much.  tho it's been a lot better this weekend.  I was hopeing to go down to see him friday ... but he has moved and is staying with friends and sleeping on the couch.  so there really isn't room and he feels it would be weird to invite me to stay there since it's not his place.  i totally understand that have no problem.  so I told him I would come down Sat ... he was going to call me later friday and we could finalize plans ...  well i decided to go to a movie fri night and he called during it (i had expected him to call hours earlier but oh well).  he left a message saying that it kinda rediculous to drive down for just one day and waste the gass and such and that he is coming up here next weekend anyway and we can just see each other then.  all very reasonable ..... excpet he is my b/f and the drive is nothing to me to get to see him.  however ... i really did need to get the oil changed in my car (it has oil dificulties and if not changed on time it will run out).  I also was unable to sleep last night and didnt get to sleep until after 4am.  so i decided that i would not go down today.  instead i got my oil changed and tried to get my stero fixed (Best Buy was too busy tho ... ugh).  I am planning to go down to the show tonight in Atl.  I should be able to see Richard then.  I also plan to get a hotel since it really won't be that much more expensive than driving all the way back to simpsonville and then back to clemson again the next day.  (plus i save 2 full hours of driving that i can use as sleep time :-D ).  we will see how things go with Richard when I am down there .... he lost a lot of points the past couple weeks with how distant he has been and not calling when he said he would and not returning voice mails or text messages.  .... guess we will see ... maybe i am too forgiving but oh well ::shrug:: its who i am.  one of my friends was reading my blog and read all about this church situtation.  he seems to be quite anoyed with my church (and i certainly can't blame him).  we had dinner tonight and talked about it all among several other things.  seems that a few of my friends from back in clemson are not happy about it ... and it sounds like some of them may show up at my church Wed for the business meeting.  this promises to be MOST interesting.  I really hope that gay "issue" doesn't come up at all in the meeting.  I don't mind being disciplined for not beleiving the Bible is 100% accurate (in fact want to be disciplined), but I do not think the fact that I am gay should have any part in it.  if it is brought up ... well lets just say I don't think my church is prepared for what may happen.  I love my friends!!!  so .. how i am now .. i guess i am OK.  certainly better than i was about it, but still dreading what is to come.  i have been asked why don't i just walk away from it all ... and the main reason is that it would simply drag on a lot longer.  i want to get this all over with as fast as possible and try to move on with my life.  let's hope things dont get much worse before they get better ......
