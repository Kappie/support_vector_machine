Yesterday and today we had a band practice, took a bunch of pictures and completly nailed down our original "Behind My Back". Basically everything has been band time lately... we want to go places and become famous! It's sad because Matt's out and now he hates me. So I lost another friend because he thinks I hate him and that I can only be his friend if he's in my band and I'm the one that allowed him to come in in the first place. haha, I just relized it, I've been losing all my friends, I don't know how. I think it's because I don't hang out with anyone anymore. All life is for me is band. band. band. Ok Bye  Wait... please for me... DOWNLOAD GEORGE GERSHWIN'S "Rhapsody in Blue" it is the most beautiful song in history. Especially the part that sounds like the ending to Mission To Mars. I sware it made me cry. Beautiful... beautiful. You think I'm joking, it is god.
