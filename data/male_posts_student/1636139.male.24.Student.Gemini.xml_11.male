I had just put stuff into the washer in the laundromat  was in the elevator going up. The elevator stopped at the lobby  then the power failed with the doors half-open. Not wanting to stick around, I squeezed through them  walked up instead. Shortly thereafter, I found out that the power outage had taken down the entire Eastern seaboard. 
  
Rather than mope around at home, my family elected to take to the streets. Apparently, millions of others had the same thought. It was nice to see so many people walking around. It was a tad less nice when I realized that the few bars  restaurants still open were filled to capacity. After much wandering, we managed to find a Pizza Pizza that was operational - hurray for gas stoves - and procured some dinner, which we consumed as the sun set. I don't think I've ever seen so many stars in TO! Walking back home was a bit of an adventure but there were sufficient random emergency lights to find my way. Apparently the elevators were actually running, although I didn't realize this at the time  walked up 20 storeys.
