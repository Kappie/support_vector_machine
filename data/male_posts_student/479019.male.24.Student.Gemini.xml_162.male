I think the same goes when I write essays.  Another boring day of work today, but afterwards I watched some of Smackdown with Kaho and Derek. It seemed like old times. It was also cool to see John Cena wrestle again. It's weird to think that I talked to the guy outside of the Galaxy before he made it to the WWE.   Work tomorrow and BBQ on Saturday...   ***
