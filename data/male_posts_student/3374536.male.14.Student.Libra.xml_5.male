Also when i looked out of the window i saw a couple kissing (i did not peek) and i was so sad then i started thinking bout my X while fixing the basin....SHIT MAN IT STINKS LIKE SHIT......  ANyway  the song is damn nice n i would really do anything for the 1 i loved.......   PlAyInG: I'D Do Anything          simple plan
