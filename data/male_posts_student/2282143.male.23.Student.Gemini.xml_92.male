But Im just kind of enjoying the quiet time.  Time when I can just sit and think and do nothing.  Listened to music, watched some Food TV, made some KILLER tortilla soup (I think I outdid myself this time...), and just got to relax while not worrying about anything.  Its nice to just zone out and not think about the problems of the world today.  No family, no distractions, no worrying.  Just me.  I never thought I would say this because I love human interaction, but its just nice to be by myself.  Gonna relax and pick weeds in the garden (yes, I kinda find that relaxing, ok?) and then maybe some early dinner then a softball game which hopefully hasnt been rained out!  Sorry I havent been writing too much.  Just too busy I guess.  Oh yeah, go to the zoo and see the new wolf exhibit.  It rocks.  Some time, I will arrange a field trip if people are interested.  Just lemme know.
