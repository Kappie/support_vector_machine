Thinking Too Much Once Again...   Forget Everything...   I Mean EVERYTHING...   Why Be Persistant...   Gave Up...   It Was Really Nothing Afterall...   Nice Chat Though...   Got To Know What I Wanna Know...   Friends Forever...   No More Doubts...   Anyway...   Day Was Rather Bad...   Really Stress Today...   How I Wish People Can Stop Asking Me Questions...   Headache During Maths...   Getting Crazy Already...   Bus Trip Was Good...   At Least Got People To Go Home With Me...   Shall Treat Her Well Anyway...   :)
