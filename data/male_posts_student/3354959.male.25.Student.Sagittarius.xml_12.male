This is surprising to me, given the success of other music festivals like  urlLink Coachella  and  urlLink Bonnaroo  and the popularity of some of the acts on the bill, especially the Pixies, who just reunited. Not to mention, of course, Wilco, the Flaming Lips, Sonic Youth, Modest Mouse, and a bunch of other bands (including the Dresden Dolls, which a girl I know from high school is in).   Rather than surprised, I guess I'm more confused. How could all those AWESOME bands in one place be a bad thing? How could you not want to go and be a part of that? Some have mentioned  urlLink electronic file trading  as the cause. I don't think that's it. Maybe after 13 years people are just getting a little bored of the thing. I don't really know. It's kind of sad. My advice: Blame Bush.
