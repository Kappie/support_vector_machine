Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Naughty Girl -Beyoncé  Peak  Billboard Hot 100  position: #3  Catching Beyoncé at her most blatantly sexual moment throughout  Dangerously in Love , “Naughty Girl” is just a notch short of “Crazy in Love” as a single. Favoring off-kilter harmonies to RB croons, she chugs her way through 3½ minutes of extemporaneously orgasmic verses and speedy bridge deliveries akin to those in  Outkast’s  “Ghettomusick.” And, for once, she takes an entire upbeat single for herself, not letting any significant other get in the way of her Eastern-tinged teasing. When soulmate  Jay-Z  was all about the dirt,  Beyoncé  was all about the flirt.  Best Moment:  That sultry and soulful high note she hits every other verse line, which makes  Mariah’s  voice-whistling in “Heartbreaker” sound like a sped-up  Kanye  sample.   The Verdict:  9.4/10 - The Fork   (4.7/5)       2004 Best Singles Club Entry
