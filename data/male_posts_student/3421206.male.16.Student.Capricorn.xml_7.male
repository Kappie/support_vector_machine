Also last night, I talked to Mario on the phone for almost 2 hours which is quite a while in my book. She relayed some info to me that she could talk to me forever. Im guessin that is a good thing right? Sure it is. We talked about serious stuff, funny stuff, not so funny stuff. She is someone who is awesome to talk to. She keeps things interesting. She said something about not liking clowns. But I found one word that she does like.....poop! Simple pleasures for simple minds I guess. Heh heh. Its ok Mario! I have a simple mind too you arent alone. These things happen. Talked to Gregg last night. He seemed to have had a good time in N. Carolina. He went to a five day gymnastics camp. He said he could barely walk. That leaves me the perfect opportunity to kill him if he messes up. Which isnt likely to happen. I should go kill him now while he least expects it. MWAHAHAHAHAHA! ok Im done. Well folks.....Im outta here so have an incredible day! Buh bye!
