He needs to see what a great person you are!! :) You and I should hang out sometime. Like Wednesday or something, we should go and see A Cinderella Story or something!!! I am so so so pumped for Orlando guys.  Ok guys, i was hanging out with Jen the other day, and i couldnt help but noticing of how much she talked about mullet. I dunno maybe it was just me. I CANT stop thinking about if i like him or not. I know once i see him im gonna start all over again. I really just wanna say something, but im soo afraid that hes gonna laugh. What do you guys think i should do? Hey brit, i havent talked to you in forever!! lol sorry guys that was random. Well if anyone wants to hang out, seriously call me! I'm up for anything. Love, Rach
