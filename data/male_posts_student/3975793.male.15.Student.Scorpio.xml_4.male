"Oh my god... ... ... did i leave the backdoor unlocked?!"  Yup, thats right.  I had another encounter with the dead last night.  this one was stranger though, because two people were there, i won't mention their names, but one of them is still alive today.  It was rather creepy.  So i get up and run to the shower again, this time i scream inside until i fell down.  and then i literally, couldn't get up for 5 minutes withough falling down again.  when i got out of the shower, I kept feeling a rush of dizzyness.  Maybe screaming till i passed out wasn't the best idea.  Then i got all my guitars (3) and accessories and went to work downstairs.  I was gonna be teaching danielle today for the first time.  Teaching is so hard!  more on that later.  So after about 2 hours of sitting on the couch waiting for my coffee/student to show up, she finally came.  coffee and muffin in hand.  I wanted a banana nut muffin, but that wasn't all that important.  I really only needed Coffee to start the lesson.  but when whe got downstairs, there wasn't much teaching going on.  We chatted for a while and played some pool.  then i picked up the guitar and wailed on it playing some awesome riffs.  Danielle didn't seem to like that very much, so she got me by asking me to play pinball wizard (i don't know how to play it).  Thats when the lesson began.  I taught her that each string's 5th is the next strings root.  took a little bit (not too long, i think i overdid it), but we got it down.  and then i taught her how to play hotcross buns.  and then she had to leave.  so after that i was pretty bored, we did however make plans to go to the WCCC Rock expo.  I can't wait to see Breaking Benjamin, Soil and all that other good stuff.  Kenny B, come with us!  You too josh :\  GUUUUUH, dinner is almost done so i think i'll finish the rest of this later.  bye.     ~*~  ~*~  ~*~   -Jim
