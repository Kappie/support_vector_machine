They'll be on display again this year for all to view at Perisher Valley. It's an awesome weekend that pulls thousands of spectators. Last year I went with 3 mates and entered ourselves in the 'tube race' and 'leap for cash'.  We didn't win either of the events, but it's the most fun I'd had in a long time.
