The other part of my brain is saying to pray for no snow so that we have a nice long summer and that I will be able to play basketball. In this instance instant gratification is defeated by long term joy. I'm really sick of the bad weather and recently I've been outside alot. Funny how living in Hazleton alters your view of warm weather. After all of those days when the temperature was from 0 - 10 Â°, 30 and up seems fine to me. I can go outside in shorts and be fine. But one good thing in March: March Madness! Ah yes. It's that time of year when we all go crazy filling out those famous brackets and waste all of our money on useless pools. And we love every second of it. As for my picks, I have Georgia Tech winning the championship beating UConn. Should be a good tourney this year. Except for the fact that the Atlanta division is stacked. As long as Duke doesn't win I'll be a happy camper. And now since it is pretty late I shall kill this post and send it back to it's rightful place: Hell.  Listen to H.I.M.
