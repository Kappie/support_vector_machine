Yesterday reached JB ar 9, and guess wat, cross the Woodlands checkpoint at 12. The custom checked at Malaysia were worst. Many people were waiting to get their passport chopped, and one of the custom officials, the one which I'm queuing, was talking and taking his own time, as if there were only a few people queuing up. That guy got me so pissed that i could have smacked him straight in the face if not for the glass window.                The weather in Genting was very cooling, but still relatively not high-tech compared to singapore. The place was clean, and it should be, but when u go out of Genting, you could see litter everywhere in the hills and mountain. The people should be more concerned about our environment, should teach them what's stewardship.                 The place actually is quite boring, and as i was quite hum, didn't play much in the theme park there. The arcade was quite old too. The billard there was quite cheap, but didn't have time to play. The nightlife was cool, got a few pubs there. I went in one of them, and there was 2 girls shaking their butts and singing on the bar top. Deep inside, i can't but think they are sluts, keep on flirting with the old ah pek dancing. The second day i went to sportsbook watch soccer, then was too tired after that and went to sleep.                 Actually got alot to blog, but no mood to blog now, will update again tomorrow.
