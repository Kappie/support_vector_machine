All the personal whiney stuff will be moving to an anonymous location where I don't feel self-conscious.  Witty and informative observations will be delivered to my friends in a more direct fashion.  I am currently learning how to be witty and informative.  Oh, and I've changed the title back to ye olde 'note to self' because that one was always my favorite.  I find it really speaks towards the essence of me rocking.
