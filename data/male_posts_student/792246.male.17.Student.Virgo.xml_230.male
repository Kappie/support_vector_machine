I call you all to arms my friends, we must go engage in *dramatic fanfare here*:   Operation: Green Blood !  I'm well aware that he lacks the endorsement of the Green Party this year and will be running as an Independent, but I think it's catchy.   This operation consists of three vital steps, all of which must be executed with the utmost care. I will now detail them.  1) Find his fucking house. 2) Go to this fucking house. 3) TP his fucking house.  Thank you.
