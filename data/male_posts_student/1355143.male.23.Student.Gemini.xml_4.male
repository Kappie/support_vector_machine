Icelandic is really getting too cold for my taste - even though I guess that our friend Tim is probably colder.     Me and my class are going to the beautiful beaches of  Croatia for a graduation-trip in june so that is more or less what keeps me alive at the moment.   I tried power-joga for the first time last week and my muscles were sore for days. I am going again today and I can't wait!..... I enjoy torturing myself way too much :)   The second ad for auditions for my project comes on in the newspaper this sunday. We didn´t get sufficient response to the last one, but I am crossing my fingers for this one!  We have a new member in the team, the set and costume designer. She is really good and I am proud to have another talented person in my team.  Her latest project was Chicago - the musical, and her costumes have gotten a lot of attention (yes I know it doesn´t take a lot to get on the news in this tiny country, but still)  I am working right now...... or rather: I am in work right now. I have been here for an hour now and nobody has really showed up. That is the beauty of my workplace. You can show up anytime in the morning, you just have to be there before nine and work for 8 hours.  So I, who showed up at 7:45 can leave at 15:45! ..... I am not sure you find this interesting at all, but hey, I´ve got nothing else to say and nobody else is "blogging"   I hope you all have a good weekend with lots of booze and women,  Svana
