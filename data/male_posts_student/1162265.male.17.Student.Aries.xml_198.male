It's like how a person feels when they get high, they feel seperate from themselves, like they are greater then their bodies, but at the same time still stuck in it.  That's the story of my life, and I have no clue where it's going.    It's like having a road put in front of you, but it  is completely covered by grass and winds through a forest.  It's like when Sophia descends into the void.  It's like when Jesus was about to be betrayed.  It's like that.  You don't know what the hell is going to happen to you other then it that it'll be something different that'll change you forever.  I don't have any single useful extra-curricular going for me.  So I'm damned to be a fucking Newspaper editor if I want to go for the big league schools.  This is such bullshit.  It's all because Aunt Susan died too.  That's why I've been acting so crazy, and having absolutely NO MORAL COMPASS.  None!    Okay whoa.  I'm not even thinking much now.  This is a late night confessional, and fortunately, I've stepped out of my body and realized that for an instant.  Okay.  Remember what A-tak said.  Hehe.  Best quote ever.  "I don't do... I wasn't doing drugs!" Haha.  She'll kill me, even with my undying love for her.
