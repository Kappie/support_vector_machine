It was totally blown out of proportion because it was on a thread about "what things bother you," and I put on there what bothered me. I wasnt aware that saying something about illegal imigrants was racism. This "thing" goes back to a day in English class when I wrote a paper about non-english speaking people getting jobs in America. I wrote something that I probably shouldn't of but did anyways to spark a conversation. I was unaware someone was going to get really mad at me, and call me a racist. I didnt mean but 1/100 of a percent of it and it still got me thrown into the doghouse. However, I said I was sorry to the person who I offended and I thought it was in the past and that everything was ok. But after I made the comment on the site I was banned and I think it was a harsh punishment for one infraction on the site. So if you ever see this,(and anyone else who sees, let the person(s) know about this), I am sorry for the comment, sorry about the paper I wrote, and I'm sorry for creating another account on the site when I shouldn't of. Sorry.
