At around the same time, an advert for  Halo 2  shown at screenings of I, Robot at Loews Cineplex theatres flashed a link to www.ilovebees.com, which is ostensibly a site related to beekeeping.  The site, however, was covered in content that did not pertain to bees at all, but was instead some form of gobbledygook. This link quickly spread amongst Halo fansites and ARG sites.  Shortly after the site was "attacked", the webmaster created a  webblog  stating that something had gone wrong, and the site itself was attacked. Later entries state that her attempts to fix it were in vain.  -   Wikipedia
