When I make friends its normally for a reason, I do it because I need something, think about it, what was the last friend you made? Now think about what led you to that person. Was it because you needed their influence, their money, their affection? Whatever, I would say that we make maybe 20% of our friends because we actually enjoy their company. The rest are functional, nothing more. This is why its very common to not actually like your friends all that much. So, here's my next point, what do we do when our friends reach the end of their usefulness? We get rid of them, we faze them out. There's no reason to keep someone around if they don't benefit you that much. Is this right? Am I the only person that thinks this way? And am I right in thinking this way? No, I think its the truth, there is always a reason. So, the question is, should I change, should I only make friends on the basis of actually enjoying their company, or should I continue to use people in order to make my life better, and lets not forget it works both ways, I've no doubt that I'm being used, is this the way it's meant to be?
