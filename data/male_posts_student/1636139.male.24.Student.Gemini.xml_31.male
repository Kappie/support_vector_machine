Actually, almost everybody on my team uses a TiBook running OS X. The lone Linux user is Tom, my mentor, who is a veritable fountain of fascinating information about Mexican food. 
The other interesting thing I found out is that both James (Gosling)  Michael grew up in rural settings and consequently have plenty of great stories to tell. 
  
I have a SunRay  a Linux box to work on, although I've been having some issues getting RedHat9 to play nice with the PC that is supposed to be a Linux box. Perhaps Suse 8.2 will fare a little better...
The SunRays are kewl because of the way they use a JavaCard to allow roaming sesions. I stick my JavaCard into the SunRay to use it and then take the card with me when I leave. Then I can stick the card into any other SunRay in the lab  my session will pop up onscreen, ready to use. 
  
A few of my coworkers have many plants in their cubicles  one of them was kind enough to lend me a couple of hers to green up my work area. It's always a delight to have rich green foliage to add some life to the artificial indoor environment :-)
