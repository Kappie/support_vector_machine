PIG! haha... Juz kidding...  Stress... Hoping to live up to standard again... I'm always a bit cranky during the tests and examination periods... I'm always trying to make people study with people and stressing people up...  Recently I think I pissed Sara off a bit... she is kinda fierce towards me nowadays... rolling her eyes and all.. Its frightening me... I'm scared that she thinks badly about me... after all... I have been acting a bit wierd lately... Maybe I'm thinking too much... but dunno why... somehow I feel it...  Timothy and Jason have gotten real close to me recently... We do almost everything together... (hey.. whoes thinking sick stuff.. huh?) haha.... But the ICAs really made us do alot of things together... going home together.. studing together... de-stressing together.... LOL... haha....  I think my group is really close to Jia Wei's group too..... Haha... oh yeah.. there is Reverand Ryan, Mother May, Sister (Sara, Sharina, Sabarina, Sonia), Junior Jason, Archmage Andrew... a hell lot... haha...    I  l o v e my  cl a s s ...  =)     What am I thinking now : Nostalgic... In deep impressionable thought... " I really think that this is a beginning of a beautiful epic... that will always be engraved in my mind, never to disappear forever.. "
