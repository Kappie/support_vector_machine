Getting back to school, I've been very bored for the past week or so being stuck at home.  3. ...this year? Enjoying last year or so of the fruits of youth.  4. ...over the next five years? College! My entire life changing completely and utterly. What could be more exciting?  5. ...for the rest of your life? Finding myself. Carving a niche for myself in this world we all live in.   Happy 2004, everyone!
