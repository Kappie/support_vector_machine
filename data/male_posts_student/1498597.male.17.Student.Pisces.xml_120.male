A host of reasons have delayed the debut of many key features of the plan entitled, "Blog Revitilization Plan." Senior writer Nicolas Brown gave an insight on why implenting these features takes so long.  "Well, there are some things that just require a bit of more work, like the periodic reviews," Brown commented via instant messaging, "Whereas things like becoming the official news source are much much much easier to implement."  According to Brown, the  Three Eye Witnesses Corporation  is trying to salvage whatever is left of the "wilting and neglected" blog which was incepted by founders  Nicolas Brown  and  J.R. Ganzon .  "With these new features and what not, we hope that the blog can be saved from becoming dormant again," Brown stated, "however, if things do not improve, the blog will be shut down temporarily, then indefinitely."  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  On the Internet:   Three Eye Witnesses : http://screwlife.blogspot.com
