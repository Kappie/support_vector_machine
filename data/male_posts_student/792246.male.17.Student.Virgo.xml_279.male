I'm getting angry at everyone and everything, and I love you all and I don't want to hurt you.  But it's not like this anger is coming from nowhere. Maybe the medication is irrelavent, maybe I'm venting. I'm taking  something  out of everyone, I just don't know what. Just...give me time to sort this all out. I promise I'll get better.
