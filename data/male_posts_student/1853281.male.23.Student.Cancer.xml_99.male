Saw my papa this weekend for the first time since december....he is doing well and has a new girlfriend.(pretty good for an 80 year old) saw the ROE crew yesterday at punk rock brunch....than got to sit in on practice. Pretty cool. They have a show coming up on Thursday.....at the Whole in Coffman....7 o'clock. Be there or be square. no more roomate, but he did not give me back the key, or leave me his new phone number, or clean out the refrig or his room. Basically his stuff is gone and i have no way of contacting him. Grrrrr. but. I am living alone again so i am very happy. back to work cheers d
