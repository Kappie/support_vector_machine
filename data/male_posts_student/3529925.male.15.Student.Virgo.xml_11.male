Kevin hasn't had a girlfriend for the past... 3 years, and his last one was somewhat of a bitch (or is now anyway.) Maybe it's because he talks in third person. [??] And I don't even really want a girlfriend. Well, I do, but I would be content with more friends who happen to be female instead of a single loving nice girlfriend. A quasi-good friend of mine is Anna, but I've hardly ever spoken to her outside of school, so I don't really know how much of a friend she really is. Then I was friends with Ani for the end of the Disney trip.. and I'm not sure what happened there. I think I accidently ignored her one to many times (I get really nervous around people i.e. *shudders and grabs sholders while eyes dart frantically about while mumbling to self* when around people who are not Kevin. That is of course a slight exaggeration, but sometimes I am a complete ass unintentionally. And I dont even know why. Then there's Rei, who is probably the only [female] friend who may end up reading this because the only place I really talk to her is online or at ZZ, once again, never done anything with her outside of ZZ or school.    Screw this feeling sorry for me. I apologize, especially to the guys who had to listen to me whine when they wanted something MANLY and ENTERTAINING! RoAR [of manliness]! We'll all just float on.......
