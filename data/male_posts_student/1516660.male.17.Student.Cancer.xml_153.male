It's a small cute little mini dog, accompanied by a note! The angel wished me luck in my exams. It also turned out that XiaoXi got the same thing too! Hmm! I guess the angel wants both of the presentless mortals to feel comforted! Such a nice angel! I placed the dog in my pencil box to accomapny me throughout the exam.  Of course, naturally, Paper 1 comes first. I did the Part 2 report first. It's about Principal asking me to write about the explosion happened that happened in the Chem lab. I wrote about CQ accidentally pouring the whole packet of potassium into a beaker of water, cuasing an explosion. I wrote Mrs Chew into the story too! Mrs Chew commented "So terrible the question! A lot of you wrote me into the story! Did you say that I fainted? (Well, we were suipposed to describe the teacher's expression!" HaHa! Mrs Chew is in the limelight! I was quite pleased with what I wrote. However, my compo took quite a long time to complete.....aI had only 2 minutes left you know! This is so unlike me! I wrote about a smoker friend of mine (his name's Benjamin by the way) breaking his promise to me about not gonna smoke again. I wrote a very long compo...4 full pages (almost) consisting of almost 860+ words. That's the longest I written! I hope I can score good marks!  After Paper 1, I recieved another Angel's present! This time is from my actual angel! He/she sent me 3 packets of chocolates! Coolies! They were very tasty! Thank you angel, whoever you are!   Paper 2, compre, is not so tough after all. Cheh! Mrs thong ar, she said she will give us a tough paper! Cheh! This paper is quite okay ma. I think I can pass. do well? Let's hope, okay?  After Paper 2, we went all around school looking for people. First, we looked for Miss Mala. HL wanted to hand in some worksheet. Miss Mala asked CQ and HL for their opinions on the compre. They said it was tough. Miss Mala then said "Told you all already. Watch more Discovery Channel! And you wnated to watch Zoe Tay!". She then turned her attention to us. She asked us if we were from Bnad 1. Gloria said she's not and pointed to me and Joyce. She then asked for our opinions on the paper. I said it was okay. She said, "Bands 1 and 2 have no excuse to find it tough!". I am horrified! She's indirectly insutling CQ and HL in their faces that they suck in compre! How can?!! Oh my! I really wonder why CQ and HL suffered this humilation in silence!   Anyway, then we ate lunch. After lunch, we went up to look for SL. We listened to Mrs Chew explaining some concepts. Quite informative. I then decided to buy a couple of TYS for O Levels. One is the Combined Science TYS, the other is for SS Sec 4's Longman guide. Yeah. After that, we accompanied SL to eat in the canteen.  Then, after eating, we went home. Met XC on the bus. He's gonna eat sushi later. Later, me, Gloria and Benjamin alrighted.First we went to Popular to see some assessment books and after that, we went home.  Reaching home, I went to bath. I went online, chatted with Wendy, brought a Pen from her and surfed the Net. At 4 something, I went offline to play FFIX. Alright. FFIX updates! I completed Desert Palace at last! Then, I went to Esto Gaza. Brought some new weapons and stuff. Then, went inside Mount Gulag. I saved before I defeat the boss. I had to go eat ma.   I just ate and watched Holland V (all about JingJing today! She's such a nice person!). Now I am online and typing blog. Oh yes! I also came up with a poem while bathing. No. It is not about bathing. If you read yesterday's entry, you know what I am talking about le. Presenting my poem!   Dual Denial  Stupid Idiot Useless Denial  Why i call it "Dual Denial"? Because tthis poem can be interpreted it in two ways. And I don't wanna explain to you now. Survivor's showing later and it is the season premiere! I am NOT gonna miss it for the world! If you want a explanation, ask me anytime. So, with this, i am ending this entry! Goodnight blog! See ya tomorrow!
