Can't wait to see u again man. Anyway, yeap! Leon is going with Mel. Hahaha, sounds like i'm cursed right? dealing with the fact that got turn down so many times... Anyway, last night i was in church and i prayed to god outside the church. Something happen... when i finished, a bulb just off. All the bulbs except this bulb is off. Sounds weird or stupid but its really cool. You should have seen it man. Anyway, i can't tell u wut i prayed for. But its really magical. Again, can't wait for arin to come back. Hope to see u again. Ciao man.
