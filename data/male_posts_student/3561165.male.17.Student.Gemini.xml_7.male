I gave them a hard time, being the sadistic bastard that I am, asking Kele (Okereke, lead vocalist and guitarist) and co to spontaneously unleash some Radiohead, purely due to the fact that Russell (Lissack, co-lead guitarist) bears a striking similarity to Johnny Greenwood. Anyway, I thought they were wondrously good, and checked out their website after the gig, downloaded 'She's hearing Voices' and it has just gone on a mindboggling rollercoaster wild-ride since then. I've heard everything they have commercially released now and it has to be said that they're awe-striking. Just consummately original, and different and well, fresh. I have a sneaking suspicion that this is only the beginning and they are headed for the stratosphere, and I have thought this since March, so no I'm not bandwagon-jumping. Anyway, I have a sneaking suspicion that their ascendency is yet to fully realise, I predict that 'Little Thoughts', as the NME describes to be their "most melodic three minutes yet" will be Radio 1 C-listed on the 'morrow and is going to be their biggest hit yet.  Anyway, enough of my mad-ranting predictions, I did my examinations today and suffice to say that I failed my Maths and maybe with any fortune got an A in politics. History tomorrow which should be breeze when adjacent to the hellhole that is a Maths exam. Tongith should be an orgy of sweat (due to weather), good music (listening to Rush) and post Henman misery, rank five in the world my foot. I hate it when Henman plays it brings out the patriot in me, which I'm always trying to subvert, I get around it by reflecting it all onto "Oh I just like Tim Henman" which sounds ominously homosexual. Anyway I shall abash myself, happy reading, readers. Also obfuscate is my new favourite word, deary, deary me.  Mood: Disgustipated with Henman Music: Rush - What you're doing; Metallica - Welcome Home (Sanitarium); The Beatles - I am the Walrus; Bloc Party - Little Thoughts.
