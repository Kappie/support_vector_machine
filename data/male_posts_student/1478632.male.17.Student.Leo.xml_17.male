Unfortunately for you I'm still here, just fell asleep for a long time...nah I lied I was just a little busy. I have a question: Why is it that the nicest people tend to be the ones that live the loneliest lives out? I mean Bill Gates, the purest form of evil is happily married, but a person like me, who is nice to everyone he sees is seen as a loner, no matter what he tries to get the attention of the girls that he likes? It confuses me to no end. If you asked anyone I know, they would say that I have never done anything to make them dislike me (Even Bonsai who ritually and regularly tries to bring my self-esteem lower than it already is). Does anyone out there know why this happens? I surely don't. Whatever. To whine a bit more, I have noticed that all of my friends have a very close friend of the opposite sex...even the punk-geek ones. Monochrome has this really nice girl named Chelsea, Bonsai has a girl named Talia (who may not exist because I've never seen her), Keys had a girlfriend until just recently, but I'm sure that he can get another if he tried. So that leaves me. The last girlfriend I had was in the summer, and we broke it off after being "together" for about 3 weeks since she "Didn't want to have a strained long-distance relationship." Bah fuck. Last night Monochrome told me that a girl at school liked me, and though I was skeptical, I went along with it for a while. Today she didn't even say "Hi" to me. Once again: Bah Fuck. On another point, I have CAD again next semester (that is, after the second week of January). This means I'll be updating a lot more by then. More on updates: Bonsai has moved to  urlLink his own blog . This means that you probably won't see a lot of him on DisInt. Keys has pretty much left DisInt alone altogether so you won't see a lot of him there either. Monochrome is still at his old blog,  urlLink here . If you feel the need to, update your bookmarks as necessary. I'll be changing the blog links as well to match this new development. One more thing: I think I'm going to change my handle to Raine. It sounds cooler than Clash.  That's about all for now. 'Night.  --Raine
