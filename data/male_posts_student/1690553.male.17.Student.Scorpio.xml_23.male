PHIM is founded by my father and his friend to help poor people getting dialysis treatment. The beach is crowded with JKR Kuantan and FELDA Pahang Family Day forcing us to move a little further to avoid mix-up.        By the way, Rahmat Wahab we'll be doing the programming job for my uncle's law firm. Don't let us down us Mr. Rahmat, I know you are capable of doing it.
