My primary observation is about the people. Danish people just have this hilarious thing going on where they all have this kind of short, round-faced phenotype, like they've been eating too much of their Danish bacon or interbreding with their Danish pigs. It's funny because all the population around them, the othr Germanic people, us, the Germans, even the other Scandinavians, are taller than them. The Danes are blonds, but that's about it. On the other hand, I totally fucking dig this place. Cycle paths here are full on lanes in the road that you step into at your peril. The girls are all kind of pleasantly pretty, although none of them are really hot per se. And everyone's so nice! This must be like the nicest country on Earth. I was expecting them to be like Germans, having hardly met a Dane before coming here (presumably since their all just sitting around Jutland trying to restrict their gene pool), but in fact they (a) all speak  perfect  English, even more so than the Dutch and (b) they're just really fucking helpful. On a tangent, I can't believe how rough the girls are in London, which I transitted through yesterday. I think I saw a cute Latin girl crossing King St. in Hammersmith, but that was it, and I can't even be sure about that one. Bang goes my theory that concentrations of capital suck in fit girls from the surrounding areas. Ok, so in Copenhagen I'm staying in this backpackers called Sleep-In Heaven that looks like an army barracks you bought at  urlLink IKEA . Just one large hangar with three-storey metal bunk beds in an IKEA-style. Of course, the entire town is like an IKEA version of a world in which the Nazis had won the Second World War. Except there's a few darkies about, speaking Danish and being preposterously cheerful.
