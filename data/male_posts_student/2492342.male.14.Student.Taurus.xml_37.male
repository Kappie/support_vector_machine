I see a girl on his lap,  He says things to her he never said to me. I ran home to cry on my bed,  Not  a word to mother was said. Father came home late that night, He looked  at me from left to right. He saw me hanging from a rope, He took his knife   to cut me down. And on my dress a note was found: Dig my grave, Dig it  deep.   Dig my grave, From head to feet. And on the top place a dove. And   remember this, I died for love... "  I didn't find to get on after school like usual cause I asked for help from ms elliott and mr koetke. it was good, though i hope i remember it for the tests coming up.... FINALS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AHHHH!!!! but i ahve friday off, thank God, and I get off early on thursday. It might be everyone, but I've been making myself feel special by saying it's because I have fewer classes than anyone else. Yay me.  I stacked up shoulderpads in PE today. It was oh so much fun. Mhm.  ANother mundane today. Though I found out that Andrea and Mary Lane were talking about me, God knows why. They got in an argument about my name, cause andrea said my anem was alex shams(crap, the hell's her last name? Or anyone's for that reason?!!!) or alex reza. they both won in the end. lol  Um...Not much else happened. I'm thankful it was mundane, because it was quick, vs. then if I had been depressed or something, and it had been hellishingly long. or if it had been Day 1. Like tomorrow, Oh  crap. DAY 1!!! Hell day!!!! bring it.  lol. delirium....i dreamt about being in mexico, though it was really ugly and old western. i saw juan while i sat on a suburban(?) and asked about omyra. I also thought of some intricate theory and wondered whether to ask my dad to take me to barnes and nobles. scary..my mom said my dad was forcing me to come with him to b  crap. im not listening to a waord aishas saying on the phone. something about tickles. ill just laugh and pretend i get it. *laugh* oh, interesting. brighton made a profile and stuff. its sweet. tho norah jones sucks. 'I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.' nice  what the hell is aisha talking about? alum????? yeah ok. riiight.   that girl who was told by brighton i wanted to kill brighton gave me dirty looks today. her eyes follwoed mine whenvever i passed her and she looked at me like i was a psycho. i sorta smiled at points. but like a baddish smile. i dont know how to say it. like when two people know a secret. wait. not really.  nothing else to say.  much love  peace  ~alex
