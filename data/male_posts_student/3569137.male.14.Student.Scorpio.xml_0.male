It was the kind of friendly attack which I totally expected, especially given it was my first time. I think I got off okay though, because as far as I know, none of the people who would really kill me about it, because they don't like me. :D Anyway, depressing day today: first batch of results. :'( I didn't do   terrible  though. That's about it.   Tatty Bye.
