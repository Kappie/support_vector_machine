AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!  im feeling really bad. i just cant do this. no. its just too difficult for me to breathe. i cant breathe! i have so many stupid things happening that i cant control any.  firstly, stupid song for stupid academis week on monday. they (certain ppl in the choir) just cant stop being so playful and fcuking childish for once. especially jeremy. he just loves to make some stupid fcuking lame actions that can just piss the fcuking shit out of me. imagien this. u are standing in front of the stupid choir, trying to get them to listen to you. and there, the 3 fcuking hippos will be talking away. jeremy will be doing some actions and get the whole lame group laughing and then thebban and shashi and amir will be there following jeremy. its really hard to control them. they wouldnt listen. and i dunno what jeremy is thinking but i think he thinks he is trying to be funny. well, me kicking his a$$ would be funny.  science and maths quiz. hannah and i will be the emcees...well. i aint got complain for that cos not much work is neede there. i just need to be there and read the questions.  interact choir. i also have no complain for that as this is the first performance we were told to prepare for. so, i guess there is nothing really.  librarians' nite is another problem. firstly, invitations not sent out. ppl havent pay for the dinner. performances not up. even the guest arent even told about this. and guess wut? the nite is next friday. wow! i have so much time!  then comes sejarah sketch. i wrote the freaking script and then the 3 hippos just can be satisfied. i mean, they will NEVER be satisfied...not until we follow their stupid fcuking ideas. well, if you were to say "no, ur idea sucks" or sumthing, they would be cursing behind you and they wouldnt commit themselves into the sketch. fcuk them.  you know whats the worst thing bout being the head of a performance? its that, when you are too nice ie listen to everyone's idea, you will never get them satisfied. cos each of them will wanna do it their way. and so, solution is, say it this way, "Everyone listen, XX has an idea" or "According to XX, we shud...." like this. In this way, u will be avoided from being called lame and everything when someone disagrees with the idea.  another thing which sucks when u are the leader is that when u try to get them listen to you, and they dont, even after you use the "soft" manner, u will feel the anger inside you. and then, once the anger cumulates and then suddenly, "BOOOM!" there goes everything. u will start screaming your head of telling them to shut their holes (happened to me today...twice). and then, ppl will say that u are bossy, stupid, lame, self centered, selfish and wutever they can think of. sometimes, they might even call u to fcuk off, fcuk u and other colourful words. and u will have to bear with it cos u need them inside the performance. tough?  this is tougher. when u are practising halfway, when everyone IS actually practising, there comes an a$$hole who will say sumthing like "what if i dunno how to do on that day?" or "wut if i forget my steps?" or "do u think ppl will listen?" or worst "this is lame" or "this is wasting my time" or simply "this sucks". and then, ppl who WERE practising will agree with that a$$hole and then the whole practise will end up with nothing.  after everything, the real day for the performance comes. eventually, everyone will do their parts. however, there will always be someone who screws up everything. and if the whole performance fails or screwed up, the students will laugh (sarcasticly, refuses to clap etc), the teachers will blame you (leader) for not practising enough, not serious, blah blah. and then, the performers will blame u for writing a lame script/chose a stupid song/didnt practise enough. and then, there would be one bigger a$$hole who will say, its becos its jia hoong's idea. thats why its lame.  i wanna breathe!  (._.)v peace!!
