I got no rest last night despite going to bed around midnight. If my dreams are any indication... I probably got a lot of exercise in my sleep. The usual running, fighting, and... playing baseball!? I hate baseball... I have no idea why I was playing it. I have 601 at 1:10 PM... so I have about an hour until I have to catch the bus. I should really get myself something to eat.  **
