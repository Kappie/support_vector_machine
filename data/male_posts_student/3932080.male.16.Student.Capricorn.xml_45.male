Now,  'N Sync  is coming back together to sing the national anthem for the  Challenge for the Children Foundation , which will be followed by a charity basketball game (expected date: July 23-25).  To trump all this crazy charitability,  Michael Jackson  has announced that he will combine the two by performing nude for children.
