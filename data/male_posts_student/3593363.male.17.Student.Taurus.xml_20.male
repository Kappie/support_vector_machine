We did nothing for a while than went swimming and taco bell. Then I fell asleep, and woke up confused, and went home.  Today (my first day off in 10 days) I finnaly cleaned my room and went to the bank. Then i ate with my family for the first time in a while, then i picked up Ian and went to Lindsey's. We chilled with Sara, and then went to Mr. Freeze. Then we watched Ferris Buhlers day off. It's such a great movie. Lindsey said he remided her of me. But i was to busy playing with her kittie. I like kitties. Thne i drove home listening to ACDC
