I've never thought that much of Valentine's day, right back from when I first knew what it was. It has always seemed to me to be over commercialism, flower prices go up, shops are overrun with chocolates, cards and all sorts of gift ideas.   If we care about someone, are we not meant to show that person our love all the time? Why do we wait for one day of the year to say it?  As I said, I've never really liked Valentine's Day, because I think, like many others, that it is designed to make singles feel uncomfortable. Through my teen years I never celebrated it, largely because as a somewhat geeky teen, I never had anyone to send a card to! But at that time of the year, when everyone around me was celebrating, and spending time with the one they 'loved', I was acutely aware that I didn't have someone in my life who was that special to me.  This year will be the first Valentine's Day in 5 years that I will be on my own. You see, at the end of last year, my marriage of three years ended. We were dating for two years before we married, so for 5 years I was one of those out buying cards and flowers every February 14th, and doing the whole couple thing.  As I think about the upcoming day, I feel sad, because the feelings and the hurt are still really raw, and I really don't need a reminder that I'm alone, not just at the moment.  So, I've made plans to spend that evening with two really good friends. I know that they will understand if I'm not my usual self that night, if I seem a little down. But I know that being with them, sharing good times with them, will help me to remember that life goes on, and that even though I have lost one part of my life, there is much more that I still have.
