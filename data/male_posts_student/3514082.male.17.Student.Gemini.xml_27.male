    
       I am so tired and board of revision. I didn't get any sleep last night; I was cold but hot at the same time and cosequently had the worst nights sleep I can remember. So because of that I'm tired and none of this revision is going in to my head at all. anyway hope your having a better time. I've got a pretty nasty week up ahead with 3 three hour exams and my whole politics course is assesed on one days exams. After that though I'm completely free and can relax, yay! 
Sorry about the rant, I am just getting very annoyed with having to do stupid revision.
Speak to you soon
Alex
P.S. When will you be back?
