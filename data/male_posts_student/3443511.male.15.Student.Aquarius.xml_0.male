Usually like, what is life, and the stuff no one can answer.  Before you ask, i am an atheist...  If you hate me because i'm atheis blow off, i hate people who hate others just because of what they are..  anyways, i just went over to my friends house.  We drove a lawn mower with a wagon on the end.  We felt like such hicks.  It was funny, we would wave to people and if they didn't wave back, we would flip them off.  Then of course, we had to do something to get their attention.  so, i flashed them...lol..  It was funny.  This dude on a cell phone looked at me like he wanted to molest me or something...It was funny.  I tried to stand up and pretend like i was surfing, but i fell like eight times, then the wagon fell apart, and i fell on my ass...It was funny..     Yeah, not much really happended....but, you know      ~All of my endings are waiting to begin~
