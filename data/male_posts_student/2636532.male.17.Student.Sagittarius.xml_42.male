You can use a pitch fork with dead babies. -What's funnier then 10 babies nailed to a tree?  A dead baby nailed to 10 trees! -What's black and shiney? A dead baby in a garbage bag! -What's the difference between a dead baby and a live baby? The live baby wriggles when you stick it with a pitch fork -What's red and white and screams all over? A peeled baby covered in salt!!! HAHA! oh they get to me every time! i must thank my twisted friends Sara and Cara for those ones. oh but arent they grand? if anyone can think of more send them in! -Matt
