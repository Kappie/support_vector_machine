For AP Psychology, I chose  The Three Faces of Eve  out of a list. (Mainly because I saw the movie in Drama, which is apparently accurate to the book.) So, that's good and all. Also, I mailed in my State Council "Code of Conduct"  "Medical Release" forms for the Board. Oh, and I letter I finished inking to Holly (our former 4-H'er  Program Assistant), who's at camp as a counselor. Other than that, it rained again today.
