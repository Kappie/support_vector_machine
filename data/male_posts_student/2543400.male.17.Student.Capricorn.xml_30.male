Anyways I'm in singapore right now and they have better keyboards at their free internet terminals then did Hong kong.  Anyways, like I was saying man there are a shit load of indians here it;s friggin annoying. They're everywhere! It's not even one or two, more like 10-20! I hate my race, damn bastards. Anyways I'm at a free net terminal in terminal 1. LOL! like that makes a difference. Anyways the plane ride was not as crampt as i thought it would. It was ok i guess.  I need to buy some sunglasses by the time i leave. Need em for the heat in india.  It's so nice to have net even for few minutes. I tried to connect to the wifi here but found out it was for pay. GAY!  Anyways I'm standing here writing this. I haven't gotten into a fight with parents yet and they are letting me go on my own tours. Man i guess i'm grown in their eyes. Anyawys, i got pictures and i'll try to upload them as soon as possible. I've been doing nothing more then shooting pics. Some are nice others are crappy oh well. Sinapore airport is nice has many of these unusual osaises, will put pics later.  I'm already missing my friends right now. They seems so far away! Sucks! But I gotta get gifts for them all.  Well that's all for now, i'll come and write more as stuff comes to my head. i got a long wait ahead so might as well. more later
