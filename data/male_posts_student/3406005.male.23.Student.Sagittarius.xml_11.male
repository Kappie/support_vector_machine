I have recently discovered  urlLink Paul Well's blog  on the Macleans website, which is, I think, consistently the most delightful read on the 'net. From there I linked to Kevin Michael Grace's blog,  urlLink The Ambler , which is equally entertaining but somewhat less agreeable.  urlLink Recent stories  about the blogging habits of a very naughty staffer in a US Senator's office have not discouraged me from beginning such a blog, although viewers interested in similiar stories here may be disappointed. Sorry.  Nor, to be truthful, is the idea entirely new to me. Fully 2.5 years ago, before blogging was cool (if indeed it is; I hope not, it would be nice to be on the cusp of something) a friend maintained a similiar online rant-source. I speculated that he should consider himself lucky if any animate object besides himself ever cast a glance on the site, and thereon in referred to him with the entirely appropriate term "cyber-wanker" to commemorate his solitary and apparently satisfying online activity. Karma has, aparently, taken a chunk out of my backside, and here I am.   Later!
