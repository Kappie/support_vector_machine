People rock.  and so do chocolate chip cookies... but that's beside the point. :-)           It's so nice when you're not in the best of moods, and then just by chit-chattin with a few people you're bouncin off the walls.     I love that feeling.  Thank you Tweet, Roo, Bop, and Doc.  And for those of you that don't know... those are indeed real people. haha  Nicknames.  Can't get too personal on the internet; don't know who's out there.  lol           I finally got a template I like... and modified it to hell and back, so I think I've found the way this Blog will look.  At least for a while.  Well I gotta get some sleep, school tomorrow... blech.    Night all.  Currently Listening to: "Wish I Could Forget You" - Silverstein  _TB
