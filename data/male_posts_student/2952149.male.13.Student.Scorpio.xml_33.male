In 3rd period we worked on our project a little bit and then we started messing around. We started throwing stuff at Tim P. like markers and stuff. It was funny. When I got home I went to visit my Great Aunts who are visiting from Hilton Head S.C. I really missed them a lot. We went out to dinner and here I am now.
