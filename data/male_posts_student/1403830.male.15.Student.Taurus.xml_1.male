About my lack of responsibility and generally useless-ness; lest we not forgot laziness as well.  so I woke up today, and when I awoke, I awoke with purpose.  a purpose to do things correctly, to put others before self, and to generally take every cliché I could and stuff it into my panties.  Well, this was somewhat accomplished; instead of getting up at my usual 12:30 pm, I awoke at 10:00.  I then proceeded to make breakfast, and GASP even cleared my plate and put it in the dishwasher.  my mother, the fine woman that she is, then decided to call me on the telephone.  when I answered, she inquired as to whether it would be to my liking if we went to the first ever farmers market in Bellevue, and then went to her work so I could help her.  normally, I would weigh these 2 options, the 2 options being  a.  staying at home; which consists of: -	watching TV -	a lot of aim  -	web surfing  -	masturbation  -	and the like and b. going to my mothers work, which would involve none of the previously described hedonistic activities, and would result in me doing crafts meant for 6 year olds to see if they would work for her "customers", but don’t forget,  today, today my friends, was different.  so, it was with those fleeting images that I meekly agreed to dress myself, change my diabetes supplies and turn off the computer, and venture out into the unknown.  when I arrived, I tried to be as courteous as possible  “mother, can I help with this or that?”  I carried back all of her bags from the farmers market and placed them ever-so gently into her trunk, then proceeding onto her work, I spent 3 hours making tissue paper flowers to make sure that they were not hard for the children  when this was done, I came home.  but  just when I thought my trials and tribulations were over, I was summoned again  this time it was to give the dog fresh water  no, never mind the fact that you are four feet away and could fill it up yourself, it is much more efficient for you to summon your son, who is located 1 story and a flight of stairs below you, to do said deed  and I obliged, I came up and filled that water dish to the best of my abilities. not 1 drop was spilled, and it was placed back on the ground with grace not seen in times like today well, continuing on my courteous kick, I asked if the table had been set  why no, my mom replied, a smug grin invading her upper facial region  well I said, maybe I should do that then  maybe you should she said  so I remove the utensils from their respective drawers, fold the napkins and pour the beverages.  it is at this point, with my task completed, that my mom tells me that she wished to dine outside on the deck  this poses a conundrum the outside table, left unused for the winter  has acquired what many would refer to as "filth"  thus, it was unfit for food to be consumed upon but, do not let that worry you; of course it would be my delight to spend 1 half hour in the blazing sun wiping that table off, and then resetting it  with all that done and accounted for, I was, mad, yet satisfied with my efforts  wanting to face the trees, I asked my brother if I could have the spot that overlooked our yard  this request was met with a "Sam I really want to sit there too, sorry, should’ve asked sooner"  yes Nate, whatever you please.  when I was done  I cleared his plate, and my mothers, and everything that was out on the table  I then put everything in the dishwasher  I then ran the dishwasher  at this point  I was heated  and retreated back to my room to escape from the retardedness of my family but wait it gets better after thinking about it for a while I realized that not once during the entire day had anyone thanked me for giving up my time to help them : whether it was at my mom's work, or through my tireless kitchen chores I thank my mom when she does the slightest thing but no, a simple, thanks Sam is too much to muster after an hour of being removed from the situation I am summoned once again this time by my father who had just arrived home from Chicago there was no hello son or, my trip was grand, was your day swell? no, I was greeted with a "Sam, sit down" I proceeded to park my derriere in a seat at the dining room table  which still possessed the placemats I had set upon it just a few hours earlier for the next 20 minutes I was inundated with reasons why I wasn’t good enough, especially concerning my grades this left me speechless I had worked my ass off in every one of those classes I had raised all my grades to b's, except in Spanish, in which the teacher specifically said that I had been working just as hard, and just wasn’t getting it now, if anyone else had said this to me my mother, for example anyone other than my father I would’ve ripped into them I would’ve yelled like there was no tomorrow no, but here I sat listening to my father telling me that I wasn’t someone that colleges want the only words I spoke during this verbal tirade were  "dad, um, I'm in 9th grade?" his response to this was impressive as I sat there, and watched him yell at me about disrespect, laziness, how the test scores must be wrong because they say I’m smart, and to him I’m a dumb fuck I bit my lip the entire time and it bled by the end at the end of his performance he asked me Sam I’m not mad at you a single tear dripped down my cheek Sam, I’m not mad, I just want you to understand that you need to try harder.  I’m not asking you to get straight a's I’m asking you to get b's, b+'s, a-'s, that sort of thing so Sam does it make sense? I shook my head and said no, and left the table as I left he yelled come back her goddammit I want to talk to you no I’m not coming back dad and I’m not an angry adolescent you're just a fucked up old man no there was no mention of  1- Sam pulled up 3 of his grades 2- there’s three paragraphs in my history comment about how nice I am to other people about how honest and courteous I am no he took the only nice point in the English comment that I am quick with words and told me it was because I was dumb it was all I had to rely on so dad, I’m through well 2 hours later instead of him coming down to talk to me he yells at me from the stairs Sam come up here you need to do a blood sugar test ok ill do one later no you will do one know fine so  I get up I comply I walk past him as I enter the kitchen "Sam, I want you to know that I said that because I love you" silence  "and that I said it because I felt that this is a time for you to make changes" silence "Sam, give me a hug" he reaches in to give me a hug "dad, I don’t have to give you a hug" Sam come back here and give me a hug dammit no I didn’t I just walked out of the room so dad how was your trip? and that’s it that’s how I feel about life
