But, then again, this is a blog not an AA meeting, and I get the feeling nobody liked Claire anyway.  I don't know what else to say.  It hurts to come looking for support and instead find your friends cursing at each other about stupid stuff.   And Now, Mtto4*   Marten:  sorry about Claire  I think ? btw, I don't appreciate cursing at all.  I respect your right to use it when you deem it necessary, but keep in mind that I'm opposed to it.  Sophia:  There are other guys!?!?   Thomas:  LC's always been nice to us, in a we're very proud of you but you won't beat us sort of way, so you can see why beating you would be nice.  Nathan:  Maybe you were being a jerk, but I enjoyed the biting sarcastic way you went about it *Mtto# only includes people who have posted since my last post.
