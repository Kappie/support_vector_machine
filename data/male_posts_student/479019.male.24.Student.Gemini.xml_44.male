Well at least I managed to secure a viewing of  Blockade  for next week.   In other news... the mp3 download spree continues! Up to 2441 files completely id3 tagged with with more files on its way. Last night's additions include the new Face to Face album  How To Ruin Everything , Randy's  You Can't Keep A Good Band Down , and Nerf Herder's  My E.P. . I'm starting to run out of stuff to download!  ***
