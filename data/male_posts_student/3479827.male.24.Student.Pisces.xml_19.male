After breakfast we were to meet Da Bao's friend and his month-old baby. It's customary here to celebrate the baby's first month. It turned out to be a much larger event than I had anticipated, with at least 20 people showing up. We were in a lovely city centre restaurant, where they'd booked a room with two large tables just for this. The baby girl was beautiful, and spent most of the time fast asleep - which quite surprised me, because there was much alcohol drinking and merry making :) The was another enormous meal, but it was a bit too soon after breakfast for me, so I couldn't fit enough it. It certainly was impressive though!  After saying our goodbyes, we headed off on the bus to Zhi Wu park. It took us about an hour to get their. Yuqi's three year-old nephew (Li Bo Han) was so well behaved on the bus, he just slept most of the way there. Upon arrival, we bought our tickets and walked for about 15 minutes down quite a long road, until we reached the water bridges. The best way to describe the water bridges is like an adventure playground for all ages, over water. There were several chain bridges and floating platforms to run across (Or more often, have your friends make you fall off by wobbling them from the other side). Me, being big and clumsy was too much of a scaredy cat to try any of them. One of them looked particularly dangerous - being a series of very large cylinders covered in rope above the water. The cylinders were, of course, free to rotate as people attempted to run across and had just enough space in between to fall into the water if you made a mistake. Needless to say, if I can chin myself by falling out a shower - this was not a good idea for me!  In the end, Yuqi and Da Bao found a really long tightrope bridge with two cables above on either side to hold onto. The whole thing had a net underneath so you wouldn't fall out. It looked a good idea at the time, but once I was on it ... it was absolutely terrifying! It was really quite long, high up and had about 5 other people on it. Of course, the others thought it was hilarious to make the tightrope wave from side-to-side with the foreigner in the middle clinging on for dear life. Although much slower than Da Bao and Yuqi, I did make it across eventually. Next time, I think I'll stick to the ground!  As if I'd not scared myself enough, across the bridge were a few fairground rides. Naturally, I spotted the one which hurled you around upside down ;) I persuaded Yuqi to join me and we strapped ourselves in. Obviously everyone else had used their better judgement, and we were the only passengers - chest restraint in place, they started the ride. It had two axis of rotation - one in the middle, and another at the platform we were seated on. This meant the ride operator could leave us in the amusing position of being stationary, upside down about 10 metres above the ground. The operator also loved my screams so much, he did it 4 times. I've got a great photo of it to show you all - I think I'll be able to upload some when I travel back to ShiJiaZhuang.  After a couple of other smaller rides, we headed home on the bus and had dinner with Yuqi's uncle and Aunt. They had kindly cooked me some chicken and chips to help me ease into the Chinese diet a little easier. We had a lovely long chat which included her uncle and Da Bao playing some traditional Chinese musical instruments (fantastic!) It's late now, so I'll leave it at that - hope everyone is good back home! Bye for now!
