Spent most of my time packing up my house and putting everything in storage (Justin and Rachel, you guys rock, thanks for all the help), but also got to have some quality time with a few friends I've really been missing. And what better way to end a long day then getting drunk at an Irish pub with good friends? =) Wish I could have stayed longer, but I guess some time is better than nothing. Looking to be a long week, as I have finals coming up on Thursday.
