Here's how this came about:   First visit:          Yesterday, I was supposed to go to the city and pick up a carton of miscellaneous luggage which had been sent by courier from Amdavad. As I boarded the bus, however, I saw three friends from my class also going to the city, to watch a movie in the only multiplex theatre here - 'Wave'. They persuaded me to come with them and I thought I will have time after the film to go and pick up the parcel.       We got down from the institute bus after having covered a very short distance, as the driver guided us on how to reach the theatre. We had to reach the Faizabad road by cycle rickshaw (yes, they abound here) and hopefully, pick up an auto-rickshaw on the highway. We were two to a cycle rickshaw and it was a roller-coaster ride (although very slow). We managed to get an auto-rickshaw on Faizabad road which took us to the theatre which is very far away indeed. There, we had already missed the 'Spiderman 2' show, so we watched an absolutely horrible David Dhawan film - ' Mujhse Shaadi Karogi? ' The film is undescribably bad.      After the film, I felt Hazratganj (where I had to pick up the parcel) was too out-of-the-way for us, so we returned in an auto-rickshaw all the way back to IIM.      This was a big waste of time when the mid-term exams are so near, but since I had done all other work for today, I was feeling in control and so didn't feel very guilty about it.       More in another post.
