Jam on my glasses........... hmm...Maybe itgot there when I was running from the Rhino. Or was it earlier, on the Motorcycle ride over?But then why wouldn't I have noticed it before? Could I have gotten it in the future? Do I even say that, or should it be "will I get it in the future?". Time travel is so confusing. It doesn't matter. I knew I shouldn't have trusted those recruitment officers. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be horribly confused. Perhaps I shouldjust start at the beginning........
