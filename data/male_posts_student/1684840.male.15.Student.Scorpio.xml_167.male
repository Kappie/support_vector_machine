Me, Sam and Craig had a tent putting up race and Craig stood there with the tent on his head.  We drank coffee and watched School of Rock in the tent which was a really cool movie!  We had pizza and we we pranked a few people from my room with the Old Boot hehe.  Overall the night was pretty rough as usual with sleepovers lol.  We jumpd around in the tent a bit and squashed each other.  Sam kept farting    It was way better than the last one and we are bound to do it again really soon  *hopefully*     I've not long woken and my face feels like it has been glued.  Craig tries to take the tent apart on me so I got out and then he started wearing the tent again.  We've just had a drink of coffee and stuff and now we're all awake again and ready for another day of MADNESS!!  I made this...   Jamie as... The Hulk
