But when Joe got 100 yards away, he heard a scream. "I thought I told you to be quiet!" he said. "Well, I was when the snake bit me," said Steve. "And I was when the bear attacked me... but when the two chipmunks crawled up my pant leg and said, 'Should we eat them or take them with us,' I screamed."
