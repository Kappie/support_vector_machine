I found some NOW arabias at borders, but i doubt ill find time to buy those.   I'm going to Tijuana tomorrow. Yay me. But we might go further south to Ensenada instead, since I know that city a lot better.     On to real things. I told whitney my secret. lol....but im in denial-ish right now, so whatever. im fine. im good. she and pat broke up, after ALL that. It makes me think life isnt worth much, if like a month and a half ago she was sobbing because Pat had gone off with someone else..and then he fucking ignored her the last 2 weeks. What a pig. If whitney had been my girlfriend, I would've held her and never let her go. Why do bastards who treat their girlfriends like shit get ahead, while everyone else watches in despair at those they secretly love be dragged away and beaten by a guy the girl thinks she loves? Ugh.    Qod, this is making me depressed. Like why I'm alone? lol.... I shall find somebody. Yeah, ok, you keep telling yourself that old boy. Maybe ooone day it'll come true. Uh huh, ok. I'm such shit.  *continues lsitening to Going Under* oh..another song downloaded..but i like this one too much to change it.  Me and aisha talked on the phone for a while. i think about 50 mins, cause the phone kept disconnecting. well, once she hung up on me after i threatened to do that to her if she didnt tell me what she had been doing with the boyfriend she ahd troubles with before me. I mean, I didn't help it, I was a big reason in the end that she broke up with him. hah. good times. Someone actually put me ahead of someone else they knew..for once...SEE!! Thats why I love aisha. Because she doesnt make me feel like shit. she doesnt make me feel like im a secondary person, just there to talk to when everyone else is gone. which is what everyone else does. UGH. Thanks AIsha.  I was gonna tell everyone that I knew you were having sex witht he boy before me when we first sort of met like exactly a year ago, but i decided not to. Hah. whoops. i just did. lol...it lightened the mood? yeah, alright, ill stick to that.   I think...I think a major reason i used to be so depressed is because I thoguht/knew that if I killed myself, or shot myself or something, people at school wouldnt care. I mean, I don't think ONCE anyone like...appreciated me being there, i guess. I mean... once. i rememebr. in 6th grade. paulina was crying and i comforted her. she was always nice to me after that. but..ugh. now lets fast forward to this year. lauren..was crying once, and she was a total bitch to me from the time i liekd her til then. SHe said she was really sorry and stuff, and tried to help. SHe's been nice to me like before, and that's really good. better than i ever got at oaks.  THATS WHAT I HATE. Poeple treated me like a shitbag. a total shitbag. They were total hypocrites. Practically all of them. This idea of a loving Christian middle was fucked. It could have just been for me. I mean...I  liked being a lone, but having people to talk to. There were so few people so it wasnt my fault i was a lone a lot... and arian, who id di become friends with, was a total dork in 7th grade. In 6th grade, we were friends. the next year...he became weird. Garrett...um...i guess he was ok. David too. But they were total weirdos, in a bad way. AHH why am i talking about them? i dont know.  Christine. I had a friend in her. Maybe not fully at school, but she could be really nice. Though usually not at school. But still really nice.   Kaitlyn was nice, but not around anyone else. A total bitch then. In the play and on the phone and then..she was nice. But when lauren popped up. Here comes the bitchosaurus. ugh. I ahted people like that, with two faces. ANd she liked me..but when i gave her a love poem... she shoved it in my face. and showed it to so many people.    'so it was from u, im sry iwas a bitch back then and i reallly hurt ualex cuz i knew u liked me. and u preolly h8 me now. 4give me? friends again?'  she told me a while ago. but i shouldve said no. i shouldve said no to lauren too. But im so weak...cause i think whatever i can get is the best ill ever have.  HOLY HELL. The screen jsut went off, and I thought everything I wrote was gone. That scared th ehell out of me. Well I'm gonna go now. Thanks for listening to my rant, thought I doubt brighton is still reading lol.  oh...below...this was up towards the top, but ir ealized it was boring so i put it at the end since i dont really care if you read it. :) lol  u can skip done to where i say the endings...    I was playing NS and got to a resolution vote. It was about euthanasia. I eloquently stated why the measure should be legalized.   "It is equal then[the voting in the region]...But, after reading the resolution, i feel compelled to fight for the rights of that little boy. This law does violate some sovereignty; yes, but so does any law forbiding slavery or demanding human dignity, as this one tries to do. By not going too far into the issue, it has allowed each nation the right of choosing certain things. Like, at what age will this be legal? For whom? What constitutes a debilitating or life-threatening disease? It is completely up to you. And thus I believe that this law will promote human dignity and cultivate a respect for a person's right to choose their life's path.  Personally, I have doubts about the concept of euthanasia. But I see no reason why those who are more sure, and know they will have to suffer for years without this procedure, shouldn't be allowed to make a choice like this. Would you rather have those with AIDS jumping out of windows? We do not know their pain. And thus we must respect their right to choose what they do with their life. We attempt to give individuals every other possible right; why not extend to them the privilege of deciding when pain has become too overbearing?"  We all take that game way too seriously. But it provides a forum for discussion on everything, and its interesting. You can see people from every walk of life discuss every subject imaginable, from virginity to Bush to Slavery. Bet you didnt know there are around 27 million slaves in the world? Some estimates say up to 20 million in India alone(the highest at 100 million), but those are probably innacurate. There are thousands of slaves in the US. sad isnt it?  Yes, very sad.  ENDING PART  yes..here we are...this is incredibly long. but u know i love you. And so with my heart I say  Much love  peace  ~alex  La ill Qalbi. Never Without Consulting the Heart.
