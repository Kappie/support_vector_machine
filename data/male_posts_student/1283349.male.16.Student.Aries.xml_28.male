Granted, Aerios is a pansy-ass healer, but it's hella fun to roleplay that guy. Specially when he's got a looove interest. Awooooga.  In other news, urlLink  Imperian  is released on Friday. More MUDing goodness to be had there... it's ridiculous how excited I am about it, too. The prospect of rising to power, garnering fame and whatnot in a brave new world is my drive, I guess. Hell, I've already got the background for the lil fella (Rasca) written, as well as his description, and even an alias or two for various RPing uses. Fun stuff. Even worse, I've set aside some dinero for purchasing credits...God save us, I have money to burn.  -Dice Squirrel Squirrel...to the MAX
