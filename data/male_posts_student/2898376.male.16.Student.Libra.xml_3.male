What is the most boring thing in the world? To set up a test for this, imagine you are in this hypothetical situation: You have just had a long haul-plane flight. You are on your way to a three-day conference about  what? . The conference's speakers will all be bald men with combovers, who last took a style update in the 'brown' period of the 70's. They will also drone. And be unable to get any jokes whatsoever. Apart from theirs, which will be long, boring and not funny. Paperclips Nails (The metal sort. Small ones, too) Boxes. Staples. Paper. Seamus Heaney / Gillian Clark etc.... Something vague and sciency - but boring.  Of these I would be tempted to say that nails was the most boring. I would find it difficult to make nails interesting for a minute, let alone 3 days. With paperclips and paper, there is the aspect of making little sculptures or origami, and we all had fun in boxes as children. Science: just a bigger subject. And staples...they're just more interesting. Not much, but more. ANd as for the poets...there's the raw hatred that would sustain me.  Feedback appreciated.
