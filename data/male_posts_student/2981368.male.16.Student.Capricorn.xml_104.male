Ellis and Upward both moaned at me in school for whatever stupid reasons they hold against me. Lunch was mostly boring, as were the lessons. And then Upward phones me the minute I get home to have yet another long yell at me. Bah.   Both Eastern and Western conference finals 3rd games are on tonight, go GO CALGARY and GO TAMPA BAY! I still really hope Roenick gets the good checking he deserves. As in, gets concussion from a cross-check or something =P And yay, only 3 days of school left.  OK. Today suddenly seems a whole lot better. Yaaaaaaaaaaay
