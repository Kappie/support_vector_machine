It has nearly no load times when you enter or exit a building, which is amazing, not to mention a time saver. And it's so complicated, I mean I've played it for just over 4 hours and I've only finished 19% of the game. Another good thing is in the game there are chanlenges, so even after I finish the story I'll still have something to do for a long time. This is definately a good game, nearly as good as Vice City, which has awesome cars and tanks and stuff.
