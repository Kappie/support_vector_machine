Its not that they will try to fight creatures bigger than them. Its the fact that they have a very rare form of unconditial care for the person that takes care of them. No matter how bad your day has been, or how many people you've had to yell at, when you come home, your dog will always greet you happily because it knows that you care for it.  A dog will listen to anything you say, and never disagree with you. A dog will never talk to you when you are aggrivated, but will pay you the attention you need when you are lonely. A dog will never take your possessions from you and claim they were their's first. A dog will never lie to you about what it really thinks, because you can always see it in their almond-shaped, glittery eyes.  A dog is a great pet to have, but it is so degrading to think of them so.
