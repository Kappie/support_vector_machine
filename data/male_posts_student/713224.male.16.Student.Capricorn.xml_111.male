The answer to the age old problem is here, in the form of a badass homebrew flamethrower:   This thing is so hardcore, it makes Mr. T cry. It is a beuatiful thing when your neighbor makes his own high powered weapon, and tests it out right in your culdisack. But even better yet, he releases the plans on the internet, so the taliban will be running around like "JIHAD!!!" with a small army of PVC fire-chuckers. Doesn't that make you feel all warm inside?  check out  urlLink this forum post  for more pictures and details.
