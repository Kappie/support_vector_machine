Other Thoughts  Now that exams are over, I'm going to try and get my shit together, slowly yet surely and get one comic a week.  Than two.  Hopefully I'll have 3-5 comics a week if I can get things working out well.  We've not even had 5 comics out already and I've heard bitching about my comic.  I'm holding back here, but to those people,  nuts to you and don't read my comic .  Next comic soon.
