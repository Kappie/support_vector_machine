I'm so excited. But that excitedness is kind of being  weighed down, because I'm just really depressed about my school. I feel like there is no one who believes in Jesus. They just run Him down to the ground, so to speak, by the way they live.  What do I mean by that? Well lets take the biggest thing in High School for example. SEX. They have sex and then they come to school and boast about it. Like they've done something special. Basically they're justifying what they are doing. And I want to go up to them and shake them and ask them "What's wrong with you? Don't you know that you're hurting yourself?"  And there's so much fighting going on, and it's driving me crazy! Sometimes I wish that some people could expirence hell for about 30 seconds. That may sound bad, but I know that would light their fire.    I just have this heavy burden on my soul. It's hurting too. I feel like I can't do anything to help anyone. I just need to pray about it and pray for some people.  If you're reading this will you please send me an e-mail?! Please I need to hear from somebody!  CHAD
