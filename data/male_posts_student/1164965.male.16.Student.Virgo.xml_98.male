But anyways, you certainly have a very interesting humor there Rob....And I'll certainly commend you for spicing this blog up with some humor :) As to breakdancing, do you know who's going to be really good at that......Tyson Cecka. So if you ever have any trouble looking for a good break dancer, Tyson Cekca can do it all for you.   And for everybody here, I demand all of you to have an awesome Spring Break!
