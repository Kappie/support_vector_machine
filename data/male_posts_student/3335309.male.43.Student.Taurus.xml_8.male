All that's left of my education as a massage therapist is a perfunctory written exam in Swedish Massage class on Friday  a few hours in the clinic.  Sigh.  I came to the desert hoping to reinvent my life, it's direction and meaning.  I've spent the last 12 weeks touching  feeling several strangers' bodies.  In time these strangers have become friends.  Of note, John and Natalie, expatriates from across the pond, have become good friends.  We had them over for dinner last week.  The festivities lasted well into the night.  My mandibles  masseters ached from so much laughing and frivolity.  Then there is Simon, our little Cypriot friend, by way of Paris.  A mere child of 26 years, with baby face looks and a pedigree as a stripper.  He's hot, he knows its and he only wants you to touch him.  Over and over again.  Stacie, straight outta Compton, a security guard at a local casino and an outright natural as a healing therapist.  I get the sense that he's as solid as the Earth itself.  The Bosnian women who sat in the back of the classroom, speaking at a volume appropriate for Wall Street.  And Mersada always commanding some young male with less girth than she, "You, massage with me!"  I'll miss everyone one of you.  Looking forward to Sports Massage in two weeks.
