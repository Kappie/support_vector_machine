When you consider that it's out of, like 321 choirs, thats not bad.  Everyone was really awesome.  It was fun. Tracy found my dream log by typing her name into a search engine and got all creeped out, so I'm going through and misspelling everyone's names on it.  I'm to tired to type coherently anymore so I'm going to bed.  Night! It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!
