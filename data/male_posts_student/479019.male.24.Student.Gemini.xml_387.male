I thought it was just as good if not better than the first. Speaking of movies, I saw  Road to Perdition  this weekend at my relatives' place. I thought it was a pretty good movie. I would have liked it if Tom Hanks got bad ass with his Tommy Gun, but alas he didn't. Has Tom Hanks ever tried being an action hero? I think he might be able to pull it off... a Harrison Ford style action hero though. I can't imagine the dude from  Big  whooping ass.  ***
