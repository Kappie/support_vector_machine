On iTunes: Los Lobos- Done Gone Blue On PS2: Dark Cloud 2 Mood: Relaaaaxed (Spring Break, baby)  Before I start on the beginning of the history of the Joe Era, I'd like to point out the hystericality (new word) of Achaea in this recent quote:  You have slain Jesus. "The soul of Jesus says, "Jesus does not pray for Salvation.""  I am so going to burn.  Right-o, on with the interesting stuff.  So, we left off with the beginning of Joe's scheming. This was sometime last summer, so there was time aplenty. Until  his campaign setting was complete enough to throw some monsters and a few brave adventurers into it, the group (Brian, Joe, myself, and for a short while, Fiona) took turns being DM, running little published modules. While the hack provided by Fantasy Flight Games, Green Ronin, and AEG was quite satisfying, it didn't have that fully integrated feel of a developed campaign setting... but in a few weeks, Joe had enough deviousness squirreled away in his lil world of Oceanus to supply us for years to come.  Since I like to hear myself type, let's have a short history of Oceanus and our adventuring within it, shall we?  In the beginning... there was Nothing. Out of the cosmic emptiness, the multiverse spawned the very first creature...Theoneous, the Universe Dragon. From him sprang the World Dragons, who searched the inky black skies of space for stars to devour. However, they grew sluggish and fat, and slowed their search, sated for the moment...in time, they lay down to rest forever. And atop their slumbering forms, tiny bits of matter built up around them, creating the worlds like a clam creates a pearl around a piece of sand. But of all the World Dragons, there was one who was mightiest in magic and strength, larger, faster than all the rest, blessed to be born with two heads, and all the power that came with that privilege. Galroc. He traveled further and deeper than all the rest, devouring sun after sun. But even he came to a halt after a long while had passed, and on him Oceanus formed, far away from any other of the newly formed "planets". While the world was still young and not a single creature save Galroc lived on it, a strange visitor came...he was, some would say, as mighty as Galroc, though you might put it this way..Galroc had the brute, unstoppable strength, whereas this stranger, Pathan was his name, had wiles, and even a bit of the Divine in him... Pathan spoke to Galroc, saying "Galroc, Greatest Son of Theoneous, I bring to you the future. This world of yours is blessed, the Young Gods look upon it with interest...but it is alone, and lonely, devoid of life. From you shall come the first race, the greatest of any: Dragons. But also, they shall be the last...and you shall witness their rise -and- death." With this, Pathan left, and Galroc cried two tears, one from each of his heads. Those tears swept across the bare earth to become the great seas that cover Oceanus from horizon to horizon...  As all worlds have their creation myths, this is Oceanus'. But that's stale history. Here's -slightly- stale history:  Through some turn of events that I wasn't around for, the Lox (Brian's character, a street-smart thief and scoundrel, weak of body, strong in mind, deft in fingers) was swept into some swirling vortex that landed him in this strange new world, Oceanus! Quite a switch from his old home of Faerun. Hell, he barely even knew -that- world, just the odd metropolis here and there. One of the first things that happened, and again I'm not too clear on the details here, was that a crystal shard from the ancient C'tan/Gaul War embedded itself into the Lox's heart during the voyage... this shard was once a part of the Gaul Avatar, a single being who nearly defeated the foul C'tan singlehandedly, though was destroyed in the process. But, he lived on in a way, preserved in these shards. They were embedded in random people (somehow doing it within the past month or so I believe). He met up with quite an odd assortment of "heroes": The illustrious Captain Silversword, Pirate Extraordinare, Wealth Redistributor, Swashbuckling Menace of the High Seas, Slicing and Dicing Consultant, General Badass; Da'te Mogetsu, Iajusto Master of Okina, Head of Clan Mogetsu, Slayer of Dragons, Way Too Badass Just Any Way You Look At It; Zoto Kotsumari, Most Pious Paladin of Kord, Hacking With Extreme Prejudice Versus Undead and Evil Nasties, Official Smiting Biotch. After hacking our way across the islands for a while, adventuring here and there, slaying the odd monster, we discovered (heh, through the "process of elimination" *snigger*) that by revealing another shard to the presence of a Shard Bearer (through killing them, of course), that shard would explode and "redistribute" itself equally to all the Shard Bearers, giving each of them amplified powers. We theorized that once all of the shards reside in a single person, then the Gaul Avatar would be "reborn" in that person. Ca-razy. Now, what about these C'tan people? Well, people isn't the pertinent term. These things are fucking DICKS. Let me explain.  These bastards and the Gaul are natural enemies, born to kill eachother. Some sort of serious psychological thing, I guess. So, the C'tan in the last War were eliminated down to...six. The Gaul were wiped out, and the shard broken. Now, the C'tan have learned of the Shards, and had this brilliant idea to save their own arses: enslave everyone everywhere! So they're xenophobes too, evidently. Wowee. Some major problems. Freud would go into conniptions. Now they're coming for Oceanus, and the advanced troops have landed...in a few months, they themselves arrive. Then, we're in the shitter.  Tomorrow: Will the Knights of Oceanus (and more importantly, Caleb) be in the shitter? Will the C'tan take their place in the shitter -instead-???  SUSPENSE!  -Dice Squirrel Will he squirrel dice? Yes, goddamnit!
