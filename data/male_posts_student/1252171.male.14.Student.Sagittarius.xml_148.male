"Hey, wait a minute," says Camo, "why are we running when you could just teleport us back?" "What, and ruin the fun?" says Sa2b. "There's the hotel," says Camo, "get ready to turn."

"Wha, no, the echidna! He's being held at Area 13!" "What are you talking about?" Suddenly, Sa2b remembers a small child and a giant thunderstorm. "No way....

The two teleport out of the room.   To be continued...  -Sane Intolerant-
