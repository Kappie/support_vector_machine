So yeah im happy right now but it didnt last long because I figured out that I have 2 weeks left until im dragged in the hot sun to march around in circles for many hours. THANKS CARROLL!! no actually it is pretty fun (except the heat) and I cant wait. So go Carroll Football! Peace out and take care.
