LOL, big European History test tomorrow for me to fail. I've tried studying my ass off, but it won't do any good; I'll fail just like every other test I've taken from that class.   Here's a list of a few things I've learned about the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment:   1. Louis XVI was so whipped by his people it's not even funny  2. The French are really too thick-headed to realize when their money is going down the crapper  3. Copernicus was so wrong; the earth really is the center of the universe  4. Newton made a big mistake (gravity my ass)  5. Cheese really isn't made out of whipped cream and horse shit (who'd have thunk?)
