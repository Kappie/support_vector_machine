The thing is that there was a little football match today though I'm not sure if everyone knows about it so I shall clarify.  You remember the little cold island where Ulli and Svana live........yeah, Iceland, thats it!  Well they just happened to have the misfortune of playing the best country in the world today.  No not Brazil,  ENGERLAND, ENGERLAND, ENGERLAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I would love to say that it was a case of David vs. Goliath and that the underdog came out on top but unfortunately it wasn't.  We crushed them, thrashed them, smashed them out of the park,                                 6 - 1  Thats right, some of us had to remember how to count up that far!  I for one did!  So ends the gloating, at least you scored a goal guys, well played!  I am sitting here with Steffen, Valerie just left today.  We have hit all the top nightspots though disappointingly Bar Paris has not received a visit!  We did it the only way possible and hit Dicotheque VIP last night which is always nice.  The night before saw us taking in Danzatoria Tibidabo and Club Sutton, all about the free entries really.  And finally, on the first night we all got fairly emborachado and ended up trying to dance to salsa............big mistake!  Steffen and Vali actually managed to pull it off, I on the other hand just preceeded to do a very bad impression involving a lot of twirling ;op  Was really nice, though very interesting at the same time to have the guys back, especially Vali as it had been such a long time....  I have my friends coming tomorrow so the carnage continues but in all honesty I am not sure if my body can take it, I already have the shits and the shakes and I am not sure how much more it can take!  Ulli, hope your not still crying...........  One love,  A
