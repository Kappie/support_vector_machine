I don't know, some days, it just feels like I'm trying to fill an insatiable void.  Life feels like me running around trying to wipe off all the Fuck You's from my walls, but they never come off, it's hopeless, and the tragedy is that I can't stop trying to wipe them off.  Ten points to who gets my metaphor.  edit: Someone rescue me tonight, I feel like I'm going to snap.
