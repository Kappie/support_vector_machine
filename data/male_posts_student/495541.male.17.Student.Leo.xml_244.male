I had an old version with a lot of bugs and a few things to work out.  I'm hoping to make it available on Halbe.org for a small fee.  It's just a simple program idea I came up with my Dad during the time I used to play on a couple AAU basketball teams.  Maybe I'll make a few bucks on it... Who knows.  I'm definitely going to do that first... Because I know it'll make money.  Other stuff I've tried with my pictures hasn't made a dime.  If I'm going to be saving up for a car, I shouldn't waste my time on things that are not productive.
