I am never going to have any free time at all, all i am going to do is to do research for the buggery papers and presentations. Gaaaah. Okay, I'm Done. In other news, i am feeling much better this morning, due i think to not going to school yesterday, and laying in bed watching movies. I watched Querelle, The Pillow Book, and Titus Andronicus. They all combined to give me some rather odd dreams last night where the location was actually a character and all i did was walk around commenting on the design of the places i was in. Pretty weird, and i know that i am not explaining that at all well. Than had my reoccuring dream where i am sleeping in someones arms, and than i woke up and felt really alone, more alone than usual. I think my subconscious might be saying i am ready to put myself out there again, which is good because my mind and my...uh...other mind have been saying that for weeks:) So, time to get out there and meet people, but i am suddenly aware that i am no good at meeting people, and haven't the faintest idea how to do so. I have always been set up or met people online(which i will never do again). So Anysuggestions? cheers devin
