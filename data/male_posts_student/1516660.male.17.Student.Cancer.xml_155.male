At MT lesson, 3 people got their prezzies! They are namely CQ, Wendy and Clar. Hm. CQ got a picture frame with a photo inside. Wendy got a crystal ball inside a a beautifully decorated box. Clar got a bookmark. Clar finally got something! Ahh! And I don't! Jealous jealous KY! Anyway, you are wondering. Have I given my prezzie yet? ~Shrug~ I don't know. I like CQ's and Wendy's prezzies! So nice! And during recess, everybody was looking at me weirdly one leh! I think they suspect I am Wendy's angel (since Wendy also like that look at me)!! Oh my my!  Okay. due to the lack of time (Charmed's showing and I hate doing this to my blog every Wed), I gotta end le. I will fill in tomorrow about today's recital. It was very intereresting! Alrighty then! See ya! Byes! Goodnight!
