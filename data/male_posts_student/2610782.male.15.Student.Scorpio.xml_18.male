Depressed initiates desperate for something to believe in enter ,people who are eager to 'give god's love to everyone'(note:its god's love,not their own) reenter the   real  world.Some are so bad that they keep going on about how god is so good and how every  small thing  that happens whether good or bad is attributed to god's will.Always it is god's will,god's will,god's will.Terrorists?God has his reasons.Poverty?God has his reasons.Sickness?God has his reasons.That ,my gentle readers,is  gods will .  Christians are fond of saying how at the end of each prayer session or service 'they are changed forever',well,I think its an irony that so many of them lead doubled lives,they're so angelic in church but when they get back to their   mundane  lives,they revert back to their old crappy selves.Damn,I'll be damned if I give my life over to a journey of hypocrisy.  -strictly a free thinker
