I really do, cus like, I want my iPod, a pretty watch, and kewl stuff for next year. If core's gonna eat me alive next year, I wanna at least look and feel good while Im goin down.  I procrastinate way too much. I should be working on my powerpoint... but yeeeaaah.  I feel sleepy, somebody tuck me in!
