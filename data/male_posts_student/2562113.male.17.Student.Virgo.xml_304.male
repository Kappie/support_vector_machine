The old man says "I have been waiting here for 10 minutes" so me and bob look at eachother and he said " Nick take off your glasses and give this guy a death stare when he comes out " so i do....and just as the door opens a [SMUT] member comes out of the bathroom laughing cause he heard me and bob getting annoyed about the wait. Then the [SMUT] member apologizes to the old man for the smell...all of us started to laugh hysterically then we went back to the heard of ppl to continue with our night
