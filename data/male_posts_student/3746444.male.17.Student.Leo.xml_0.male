I know if I get to close she will burn me but if i stay to far i get to cold. When we used to be I was warm but I alone set her out and found my self trying to find new things to warm me like i used be. My flame used to warm her friends as well as mine but i saw once i put her out she drifted to only one other. All of us gathered and huttled together to keep warm thus growing all of our friendships but we all knew something was missing. I turned around and i saw her making another man warm. She seemed brighter than she has ever been i almost didnt recognise her until i remembered that i saw her like that once before thats the flame that used to warm me. Only it wasnt warming us she was warming. She was burning brighter than ever as if another flame was joined with her. But i feel now that if i get to close that i will try and start another fire using her flame But then again i dont want to get burned once more. Maybe Shakespeare isnt right maybe it is better never to have loved.
