Cause I know I'm growing up to be a better man. Father I will always be, that same boy that stood by the sea. And watched you tower over me. Now I'm older I wanna be the same as you. What's a dad for dad? Taught me how to stand, dad. Took me by the hand and you showed me how to be a bigger man, dad. Listen when you talk, dad. Follow where you walk, dad. And you know that I will always do the best I can, I can. Father I will always be, that same boy that stood by the sea. And watched you tower over me. Now I'm older I wanna be the same as you, the same as you. Father I will always be, that same boy that stood by the sea. And watched you tower over me. Now I'm older I wanna be the same as you. When I am a dad, dad. I'm gonna be a good dad. Do the best you could, dad. Always understood, dad. Tell me I was right, dad. Opened up my eyes, dad. Glad to call you my, dad. Thank you for my life, dad. I love you dad!!
