But still, my appearance is marked improved. I no longer have that slight discoloration in the gumline of that tooth. I've had that since I got it broken in a tragic sledding accident...what, 5 years ago? The gap between my two front teeth has been closed as well. I've had that since I was born. I plan to join the localYMCA as a Youth member and my mother plans to talk toaskindoctor she knows about my acne.I feel like an upgraded Agent, all spiffy and speedy. If only I could hit that Neo guy...  I'm at least 90% completed with my job applications (took me damn long enough, eh?). I found out my supervisor for 3 years was Jim Rhinehart. Huh, who'da known? Well, finish that and the resume and I'm well on my way to leaving my torture game of a job. I was actually told by a passing car-driver to get a real job (a friend in fact). Well, you just can't argue with that kind of coincidence.  I've started performing a ritual called the Wesleyan fast. It involves not eating anything (much like other fasts in the rule book) from morning till 3:00 on Wednesdays and Fridays. Supposed to help with my prayer life, so I can't complain. Wonder if my family will figure it out someday...nah.
