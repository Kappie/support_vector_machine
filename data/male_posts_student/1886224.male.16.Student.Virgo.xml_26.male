After a few boring hours at my grandmas house, I came back and met up with Joe, Tom, and Jimmy and we went to Chris' house. I drank like 6 beers and a few wine coolers in like 10 mins. I'm still a little messed up from tonight but I am able to write this post. I met this girl there who happened to be my friend's little sister but I couldn't recognize her. She was only 13 years old! I could of sworn she was older. She looked good and I tried to get with her a few times but nothing happened. She was too drunk and young so it didn't feel right. Jim's mom took me home and here I am now! Woo! Good night!
