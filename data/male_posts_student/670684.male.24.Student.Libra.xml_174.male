It sucked anyway; quite honest and telling, moreso than a blog should be, but something so important should never be shown in first draft, and once it hits second draft, the honesty is gone.  It's the folly of writing.  It's why I am struggling at the moment.  Hopefully I can pass that problem and make this shit happen again, because a screenwriting grad student who isn't writing screenplays is just another grabass jackass.  So why am I not writing a screenplay?    Padres lost another heartbreaker.  Two losses in three days that were decided in the last out of the game.  It's almost too much to watch.    Tomorrow is Day 1 of Honesty Relationships.  I should copyright that, sell it to power lunch business gurus in LA, put inspirational phrases and quotes from people with funky names from funky times on colored index cards, pass them out near the smoothie stand, smile a lot, wear suspenders, and talk in the energy meets radio voice about feelings.  What is funny is I'm embarking on a road of telling people to fuck off.  I love people...I have a lot of friends, and a lot of great friends, and some good friends who hopefully will become great friends...I live to inspire others.  I don't live for the bullshit.  Bullshit equals fuck you.    I want to rewrite my entry, but I'm tired and I promised myself that free internet porn would be my reward if I posted tonight.  Most nights, the writing wins out.  Tonight it's porn.  Who is walking the plank at Captain Lust.com?
