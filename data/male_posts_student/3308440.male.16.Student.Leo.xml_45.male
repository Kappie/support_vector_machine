So yeah that was yesterday now I am sitting writing this kind of bored really, the worst thing is it's hot and sunny out but all my friends have dissapeared, so if anyone wants to talk or anything just AIM me or email me (all details are in my profile) please.  More intresting and thoughtful update to come...  See ya  Dan :)   Current mood: Bored  Current music: Daniel Bedingfield - Gotta get thru this
