I still let her go outside on our lawn which she isn't normally allowed to do, so I made up for it. In other news, I got a kickass CD today, and it was free! In Borders they have their anime section in between their two kid sections, implying it was all appropriate for children. So I had the urge to recommend to some mother one of the ones I knew had at least one graphic rape scene. Seriously, someone is either really stupid or really mean.  Did you know in Japan they use sinks to fill their bathtubs? Well it's true, whether you believe it or not.  When my parents aren't here my house doesn't magically clean itself up. How annoying. I'm gonna ask the cats to do their part. brb. Assholes.  Dubbed Hentai is the best. Where else do you get chicks who magically grow dicks AND find badly acted wonderful lines such as "Why are you squeeing my tits professor?".  16 days til my birthday. w00t. hehe.  Jonathan:"NY Style Pizza sucks." Me:"Suck it." Me: "No, the pizza!"   Strange I know, but there was a time when people were unfamiliar with Bible Black. Fascinating I know. I also lost the aforementioned kickass CD, which was Jonathan's Friends Mix CD. I want another copy from someone sometime.
