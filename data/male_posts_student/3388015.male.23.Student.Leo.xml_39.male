I got back from working out at the gym during my lunch hour. Very busy today at the gym, it was luck that I got on a machine at all. I think I'm gonna head to my mother's place this weekend to hang out. Not sure yet. I need to start packing soon for my move next week. Oye.  Quote: Cindy: How did you get those bruises?
