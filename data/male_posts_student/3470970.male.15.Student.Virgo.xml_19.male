I was feeling bored (always use that as an excuse if u do something lame) so I took a picture of my desk..AGAIN...just to show you how the amount of work I have to do increases.     Oh yea, and here is a fake Gucci watch I bought for Rp. 50.000 ($7), cool isn't it? I will take a few photos of the shops that are filled with pirated CDs aswell. I love pirated software.
