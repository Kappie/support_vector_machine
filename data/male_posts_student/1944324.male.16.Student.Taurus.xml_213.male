Just wanted to wish everyone happy (insert holiday here)!  I hope everyone has  a good holiday and a good break.    You guys' phobias are silly.  I'm slightly arachnaphobic and claustrophobic...but not to the point of whatever.  I suppose I am a little afraid of going into the guys' bathroom, but I think that's just funny cuz it's not like they'd mind if there was a girl in their bathroom, right?  Oh, and, Marten, I hate that feeling...that your fly is unzipped...I always triple check before leaving the bathroom, just to make sure that I'm not showing everyone my pink polka-dotted underwear.  Not that they'd mind.  Again.  oh well.  bye.    Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret.
