It’s not so hard to Understand that I’d do Anything for you. Why can’t we be… Why can’t you see That I LOVE YOU!?!  Some called it obsessive And some just called it love… But I did NOT give a fuck What people said about us. We were off somewhere, Off in our own little world, Cause I was your special boy And you were my only girl.  It’s not so hard to Understand that I’d do Anything for you. Why can’t we be… Why can’t you see That I LOVE YOU!?!  My eyes still burn, Sometimes they must. Tears still flow down, I’m not about to bust. I’ve got more left than The days passing take. Im enduring more than I ever thought I could take.  It’s not so hard to Understand that I’d do Anything for you. Why can’t we be… Why can’t you see That I love you?  I LOVE YOU!!!   here ends the love making session
