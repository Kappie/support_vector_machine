It isnt about who you've kissed, which sport u play, which guy or girl likes u.   It is not about your shoes or your hair or the colour of your skin,or where u live or go to school. In fact its not about grades, money, clothes or colleges that accept you or not.   Life isnt about if you have lots of friends or if you r alone and its not how accepted or unaccepted you are.       Life just isn't about that       Life is about who you love and who you hurt.   Its about how you feel bout yourself.    Its about trust ,happiness,compassion.   Its about sticking up for your friends and replacing inner hate with love .   Life is about avoiding jealousy, overcoming ignorance and building confidence.   Its about what you say and what you mean.   Its about seeing people for who they are and not what they have.   Most of all its about choosing to use your life to touch someone else's in a way that could have never been achieved otherwise.       THAT'S WHAT LIFE'S ALL ABOUT!
