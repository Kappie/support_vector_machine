You know what, I'm starting to feel like a stalker. Every time my phone beeps that there's a new message, my heart jumps and I flip it open as fast as I can... only to find that it's someone else. Then I get all depressed, and end up sending a message to Kat. That's really the only way we're communicating. As she is in Vegas, she can't get to her IM, or the internet. That's right, she hasn't read this.  Boy, how creeped out will SHE be.  Go read the rest of my blog starting from the bottom up.  Bye.
