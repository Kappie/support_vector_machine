Kari was the last person i felt totally open with.  she was a great friend... the closest friend i ever had.  i guess thats what i'm lookin for still.  someone to fill the void left by her.  not to say that i havent had great friends... cuz all my friends are wonderful.  i just want more... that sounds selfish i know... but everyone seems to have that one person who they tell everything... that they trust with anything.  i want that so bad... again.  man.. i sound so depressed.  i think its time for some Canon in D... its good for the soul.
