So i stayed home waiting to take phone calls if they called, the phone had been of limit's for anyone to use. i was able to convince my mom to let me use it for 20 minutes which allowed me to do some stuff but not a lot. ANyhow so they called(mom) saying if they had called, becouse there aren't any Shell gas stations on N, shephard, and so i waited then they called it was almost 2:30 in the morning whe they called (visitng family) Adn where like we are located in so and so near a greenhouse. so i called mom and gave the location of were they, so when mom arrived she was like where th hell are they if been going in circles in the location they gave me. So they came home and left my uncle to search for them by this time it was 3:30, and i was being blamed , and i was like what the hell, you're blaming me becouse you can't find them, what was i supposed to do tell them to make a left on the next light, if you couldn't even find how was i supposed to know where they are. This of course shut up my aunt and her bitching. SO we waited a while and mom told my uncle t stop looking so, we decided to wait and see if they would call or soemthing, so by now it was 4:20 or somewhere around there.  So this time we were told they were in rosenburg, they had gooten ion the freeway and missed the exit and wound up over there. So i went this tiem becouse A) my mom didn't want to listen to my aunt's complaint's B) if they called she'd probobly write down every thing thy said, from pauses to every word per word. C) she needed to give my uncle (who was now on the search with us again) they're cell phone number's which i had to reapeat by memory, becouse they were inmy mom's cell phone now and she was calling my uncle to give then to hin and so only havin seen them 5 times in that day was like 265-8889 and so forth *note this isn't the actuall number this is a made up number so it doesn't in anyway link to me. SO we were ehading out to resenburg which is what 30-40 minutes away. so onthe way there we run into dearest uncle, who happens to have as a choufer one of his many mistresses. so we find them and it's already by this point it's almost 6 so we spend a whilke there 10-15 minutes just chatting and asking what happened? SO when i was outside i saw my uncle looking like he'd been doing some hard partying, and at that moment i had a memory flas to a couple of years back when we were on a trip to mexico city in car and there really weren't that many car's on the road, and so i remember we were besides this truck and i looked at and next thing i know i see 2 people a guy and a girl, the girl is leaning to the guy's side she's facing the rider's window and i see her bend her head down and then comes up again and so i was like oh my god she's giving him head, and i also was like that must be hard for that guy to concentrate on driving while his wife or girlfriend or whatever give's him head. and so i was like oh my god when i saw my uncle and his new girl, which really didn't surprise em becouse he has different girlfriends at different time of the day and week. so back to the family it took a while longer ecouse we went around the galeria area so we didn't have to pay the toll. so now it was like what past 7 se when we got home and my aunt was like it' hard not knowing a city. and so to make thing's more welcoming my uncle invited is to breajfest at Ihop and so my aunt was like are you kidding I'm not dressed properly and i was like this is free breakfest at Ihop and I'm in partial pijamas so what the hell. So she didn't go becouse she wasn't dreesed and showered for the occasion. So WHile we were eating i discovered that my visiting family and my uncles girlfriend have knowledge of beliefs and remedies we were talking about re-incarnation, but mostly about oil's and blends and what the are good for and superstitious beliefs about certain oil's while eating. So the basic meaning of this story is that i don't tink there''s one but it hink it is alway's choose a point where you're going to pick up soemone choose a specific location. well that's that
