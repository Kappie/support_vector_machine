I know that Iraq has a ton of oil, and that some people think that the reason we invaded Iraq was to exploit this oil, but unless I'm missing something, I think the United States is in fact losing tons of money on the war. We have spent 87 billion so far in Iraq, and it looks like we will continue to spend more. The oil in Iraq is owned by the Iraqi government, which distances itself from the US more and more. The US will have the same access to their oil as previously, and in fact it may be less because of the militants attacks on oilfields. You may say that the reason that the Bush adminstration wanted to attack Iraq was because of their connection to the oil business, and this may be true. However, the reason that 70% of Americans supported the war (not me however) was because they thought we were going to fight a dictator who committed genocide, not because they would profit more from the easier access to oil. Don't even mention Halliburton, they aren't ripping anyone off except we stupid Americans. I am genuinely not sure, but could someone please tell me what the difference between now and our access to Iraq's oil fields, and previously? Thanks.
