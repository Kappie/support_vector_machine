I might have a quick glance at some of her other more recent music if I get a chance. Don't you just love little surprises like that?  Anyway, today was meant to be Pure mat's revision day, but it didn't really work out since I struggled on a load of the practice questions and was distracted many a time by the Internet, my cat and food amongst other things.  What makes it worse is that next Wednesday I have the exam in it! Ahoy!  Talking of exams and tests, I have another driving lesson yesterday and my instructor sprung a surprise mock test on me, the sneaky so-and-so. I got 11 minor faults (all mirror checks) and 4 serious faults (opus!). Still, that is quite good for a surprise test. My actual practical test is on the 26th, a week that's packed full of university visits. Actually, while I'm on the subject, I'll roll out my crazy diary:   Friday 18th June - miss school and travel to Manchester Saturday 19th June - spend the day at Manchester university open day Sunday 20th June - spend the day in Manchester Monday 21st June - miss school and travel to Nottingham university, where there is an open day, then travel home Tuesday 22nd June - actually go to school! Wednesday 23rd June - miss school again, travel to Leeds Thursday 24th June - miss school, Leeds university open day Friday 25th June - miss school, Sheffield university open day, then travel home Saturday 26th June - driving test 9.37am, then off to Reading University open day!   How crazy is that!? I might as well take Tuesday off to do some driving!  On the gaming front, I finished my review of  Gran Turismo 4 "Prologue"  today, giving it 6 overall, plus played a bit of  Call of Duty  as I was in a D-Day kinda mood with all the anniversary things going on. I've also become increasingly interested in  Full Spectrum Warrior  recently after watching a 15 minite demo video of it. It's such a shame that it's out in the US right now, but wil reach our shores on the 25th. Then again, I've got exams and crap right now, so can hardly play that many new games. Uh, or in theory I can't because I'm far too busy doing revison (he says writing his blog, chatting on IM, listening to music). Hmmm...  And now finally for a little list of a few things I can look forward to, just so I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, a tunnel which is currently dark and shouting "exams!" at me.    Finishing the exams!   Getting my digital camera   Passing my driving test! (fingers crossed)   Visiting all those universities   Seeing Thunderbolt V6 launch   Going on holiday with my friend who I'm going on my gap year with   Going off to Poland    Enough of this blog for tonight, now is the time for TV and a huge bowl of ice cream :)
