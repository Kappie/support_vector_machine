       
      I just finished reading  1984 , by George Orwell. As usual for me, it was hard to put the book down after I started reading it this morning. I would call the day wasted, but it's summer and it was a good book. Now I can sleep, as long as I make sure I don't mumble "Down with Big Brother!" in my sleep loud enough that the telescreen can pick it up.
