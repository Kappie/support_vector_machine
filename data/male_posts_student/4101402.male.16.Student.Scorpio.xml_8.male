Frankl suffered in a German concentr I ation camp. It was there that he claims to have discovered the meaning of life: love. I'm about half way through it, so we'll see how the rest of it goes.      Other than reading, I played a little bit of billards today. I'm getting to be pretty good at it.  Today, I played my best game of 9-ball ever. I made the break, then hit the 1 ball into the 9 ball, which then fell into the corner pocket.  One shot after the break is my new record.  News on Murray, my lawn mower: It's dead. We put in a new spark plug and it won't even spark now. We're going to have to send it to someone who can fix it, as it must be an internal problem. Dad said that I should use the push mower and mow the back yard. Yeah...I don't think so. I don't feel like taking several hours out of my day just to mow grass.  Car news: A dealership 20 miles from home has a red Avenger for sale. It's got everything I'd want (automatic transmission, CD player, power everything, premium wheels, etc.). There is just one problem...it's got the 2.0L 4-Cyl. engine that produces 140hp. I think I'll just wait for the V6.  That's all for now. Talk to you later.
