Thus, Jai is running outside every five minutes and chasing after delivery trucks...anyway. 90 minutes 'till my first driving lesson. Should be fun. No, not fun, what's the word... painful.  That's the word.  Stay inside, lock your doors, authorities have the situation...well, go ahead and  panic  then.
