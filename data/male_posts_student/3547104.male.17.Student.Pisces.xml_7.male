And let me just say, what a year it has been (The best year ever hands down!) I am most certainly going to miss my people in every one of my classes. So I've decided to decicate this entry to people whom I actually like and enjoyed being around:   MUZZI: Nice ass. ('Nuff said.)   Dijana: Oh, my bosomy Bosnian friend. You are honestly one of the only people my age who I admire. You've been through so much and you're an extraordinary bumper and grinder. I  despues de la tempestad, biene la calma     Ashole: What can I say? I LOVE YA!   The rest of the IB Env. Sys. Crew: I'll miss those long ass mornings, intellectual conversations, and steph's random ranting. I    Jessica Diva Puuuuuucek: Girlfriend, you is the one that kept me sane in that clown Kent's class. *Two Snaps* Thank you for always putting up with my nonsense, sleeping, arm in/on your back, rubbing of your shoulders, and my B-S in general. OH NO! NOT THE GUMDROP BUTTONS!    Bobbi Blo  job " STYLE="text-decoration: none; border-bottom: medium solid green;" HREF="http://search.targetwords.com/u.search?x=5977|1||||job|AA1VDw">Job : Oh my, you've been there for me since day one... literally. I'm glad you are my hag forever and always.    John Juan Mattimore: Although I picked on ya like hell this year in Spanish, I luv ya... ya big H pronouncing conservatist you.   TO THE HOT CORNER IN MATH: You are the sole reason as to why I did no work and failed every damn test. And for that, I thank you. Ya made Phalen's class entertaining. To Raven: LOOK AT THE FAT GIRL!!!! To Inna: I see London, I see France (or Iraq)... And to Katie: Pickety Pick pick, wipe wipe, LICK!   AND FINALLY TO MY soulMATE CAIT, LOOSE-SEAL, AND BROWNIE: There's not enough space on the entire world wide web where I can put into words how much I appreciate you guys. I love you dearly, and I really relly mean that. Thanx for everything. TOXXIC DIRRT '04   06/10/2004: A BRUSH WITH DEATH Well, today was an average day once again... EXCEPT for the fact that I almost died. This band was going to play during lunch on the front lawn of the school, so cait and I decided to go watch. Let's just say, I don't belong in punk/rock shows EVER, but I made an exception cuz I knew some of the band members and cuz Cait loves that kind of thing. We get there, and there's a pretty large group of people there; including those who are "punksters" and belong, and those who obviously don't belong there (Namely my girls Gina F. and Maggie.) The minute I start realizing the music is pretty good, this kid is thrown in my direction (he was crowd surfing)... so naturally, I stepped out of the way. Then, I got caught in the middle of this mosh pit thing... I'm trying to desperately get out (I'm fearing for my life at this point)... I'm getting shoved in all directions... The second I got to safety, Cait pushes me back in there and is like: GO, ITS FUN!... I was shoved around some more, kicked or kneed in my left kidney area... I was clutching my side, for I was in pain... Then, out of the blue, I hear two voices say: NATE'S IN THERE! Two glorious angelic hands pulled me out of the pit, full of nasty ugly people. I look up and it was Maggie and Gina! I WAS SAVED! They then told me I looked terrified and that they knew I didn't want to be there, so they yanked me out. I'm glad I have hot gorgeous guardian angels. I     I whip myself scorned... I wanna hear what you have to say about me, hear if you're going to live without me... I wanna hear what you want... I remember December.
