I've got digital cable on my desktop now - using an ATI all in wonder card - for those of you unaware, ATI is the company that brings you video cards that a) outperform the competition while b) not requiring a breeder reactor to power them. It's cool, it's transparent, I'm wating it through this post.  Political ads on TV are terribly unimpressive - I'm glad that for the most part we've stayed away from the more hardcore mudslinging ads that the Americans have to suffer through. I'd probably vote conservative this year if it weren't for Steven Harper - motherfucker creeps me right out - he's like some kind of fembot - seems  too  smooth. I also get the feeling he'd embarass us on a Bush-like scale at some point. Jack Layton and the NDP are like Homer's view of solar enegery - a pipe dream. Whoops, I take that back - I just got to watch a Liberal ad labelled "Think Twice, Vote Once" - big old slam on the Harperino. Not sure I like that. I think the best thing for Canada at this point would be a minority government with the liberals at the helm. I'd like to see them co-operate with the conservatives to keep them fiscally responsible - seeing taxes drop would not be a bad thing at all. I'm sick of paying, and paying, and paying.  I enjoy creating a schedule for work and then having most of it thrown away without a thought. The three hours of my life that go into creating it really means nothing. *sigh*  I don't like the new Toronto Bluejays logo. It's Harper-esque in its slicknacity.  My HP camera is still sexay.  Euro 2004 is exciting. It's nice to watch both the Italians and the Germans sitting on the sidelines. We shall call them the "Axis of Spectation". We've got England v. Portugal tomorrow. I'll either be very happy or very sad.  I'm tempted to watch The Good, The Bad and the Ugly again. It's three hours... but, oh, those hours.  Finally: Glennis has been uber grumpy of late. I'm torn between trying to cheer him up and trying to piss him off. I'm tempted to bring him some canned goods or something - he's just... gah. What should I do? You've all got my email - discuss.
