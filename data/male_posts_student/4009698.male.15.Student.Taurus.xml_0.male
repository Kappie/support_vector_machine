Anyone would die to have a job like that. Maybe not Collingwood President, but Eddie McGuire has enough on his plate.  I remember when he hosted the Formula 1 telecast from Albert Park. That was unbearable. He's also hosted the logies. That was unbearable aswell. The point I'm trying to make is:  Eddie, Shut up!  I know there's people who reckon that Eddie's doing everything for the good of the game, but WRONG!!!! Eddie is a wannabe-bigshot who has nothing to do but unleash verbal diahorreia on the public.  Thank god there's a website to help the public of Australia that hate Eddie's guts:   http://www.petitiononline.com/shutuped/petition.html
