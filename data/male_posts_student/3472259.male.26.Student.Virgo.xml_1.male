I believe this to be true of all people, regardless of their location. Ethnicity, nationality, heritage, royalty, nobility, etc…. is all a bunch of BULL$HIT.  We are all the same race.  No one is anything other than a human.  Being human has no link to wealth or social status.  The rights of humanity belong to all equally.  No one is any more than someone.  I just happen to be a cracker, but I can not take credit (or blame) for what other crackers have done, know why?  I was not f#@$ing there!  I was born in the USA, but I’m supposed to be Irish?  What then constitutes being American, Irish, Italian, African, etc.  If it is not geographic location then what is it?  Ethnicity?  What is that, other than a social system?  I was not raised in an Irish society, so how am I Irish?  I am not an Irish-American, I am an American.  To me being American is not my nationality.  Nationalism implies an heir of superiority that I do not feel.  I do not believe that Americans are better than, just as an example, Iraqis.  I feel that all people are created equal and are given by God, not a government, certain rights including ….  The words of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are, to me, some of the most beautiful in history.  Our system is the culmination of the Enlightenment, and the relationship between the government and the people that it portrays is revolutionary.  We, the people, are not subjects of, but the power behind this government.  It is because of my belief in the equality of all that I am an American.  It is true that America and Americans have not always lived up to this ideal; this fact, however, does not make this vision invalid.
