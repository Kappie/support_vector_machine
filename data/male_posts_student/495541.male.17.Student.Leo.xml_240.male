Definatly a degranged film.  It's about an old guy (Billy Bob Thorton) who is pretty much a bum.  He has his jobs being santa then he robs the places.  He swears a lot and drinks constantly.  He hooks up with a santa obsessed jewish woman.  This kid comes along and the old guy ends up living with the little kids grandma and him.  Weird movie, but I don't know much else to say about it.  It was alright.  Probably just a low budget comedy.  John Ritter's last film.  R.I.P.  I don't have much else to say.  Practice in the morning, I should go to bed so my sister doesn't scare the crap out of me again.  I forgot she was sleeping on the fold-out couch.  Peace.
