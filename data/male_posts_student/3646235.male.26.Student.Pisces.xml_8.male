He mostly talked.  Most of my questions seemed to fade away before I could ask them.  It's like when you have a debate with someone and think of all these great responses, but when you actually have the debate your points are moo.  I had several questions about things in the Bible, most importantly how can you trust everything if it was written by men?  He said that they were just stories for the most part.  Before most people were literate, the only way to pass things on was to make a story out of it.  Everything in the Bible did not neccessarily happen, but the message is what is important.  Hmmm, something to think about.  Now to think of more questions for him next time.  We'll probably meet in August, so I have plenty of time.  I really want to have a stronger faith, and maybe thats the most important thing.  Once I'm there, it won't be a half-ass endeavor.  Maybe I intentionally slow my progress so I won't have to go to church as often.  That's a sad.  More on all of this later.  Things I need to work on: Praying more Reading the Bible Going to Church
