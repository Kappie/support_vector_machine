How much i wished to be you..  My life is full of ups and downs.. Often i thought.. It always should resembles the life of a normal one.. But things don always go in my way.. Again.. Thats another resemblance..  Many things happen in a day.. For which.. many i hoped never happens.. I never expect any consequence.. That leads to violence..  Friends are like footprints.. Many people walk in and out of your life.. But only friends leaves footprints in your life.. They could be an agony.. However only sometimes.. Moreover often many times..  I feel like giving an advice.. But your character seems like stubborn of a kind.. You insist on what you wants.. I could only forgive what you have done.. What a friend.. Having a friend is always better than having an enemy.. Remember..  You too...
