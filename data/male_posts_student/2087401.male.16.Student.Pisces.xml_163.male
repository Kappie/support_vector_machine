His overexcessive posting made it less obvious that I wasn't posting much.  It was nice.  kinda.  lol.   So I'm feeling kinda random.  Bummer...I was gonna try my luck with a new conversation, but since Michael's gone...DANGIT!!!  grrness.  stupid men and their stupid inferiority complexes.  Stupid, stupid, stupid!  Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog.            Woof!
