Seriously... what is the world coming to!? Soc Sci 3A becoming a real class, heightened violence in the Middle East, bombs going off in Columbia, troops to the Phillipines, white cops killing more minorities, springing forward for daylight savings, idiots driving the wrong way on the freeway trying to kill people, perverted priests... the list goes on and on!  Screw homework for now. It's due at 5PM, which means I have approximately 17 hrs to get it in! I hear my bed calling.   ***
