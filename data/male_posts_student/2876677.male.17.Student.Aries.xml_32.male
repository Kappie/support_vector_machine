Frankly I hope its a lie but if its not then I don't see why you think not crying EVER makes you stronger or more masculine.  I mean I don't cry often but I do cry when things happen.  Like when my one of my best friend's sister dies then I cry.  Or when somebody who I really care about tells me they have had sex before marriage and have a STD, then I cry.  I just isn't worth it to hold it in.  Life is way too long to hold it all in every time something goes wrong.  Life is way too short to let it hold me back.  Crying just makes things better.  If you hold all the tear's in, you are drowning your soul.  I really wish I wasn't sick today.  I missed school.  I am missing church.  I MISSED MRS.BODANZA'S PIZZA!!!  Shout out to Jess Booth.  You are a nice kid.  Sometimes I wonder how our school got so lucky.  Sorry for ever being mean to ya. Remember:It's ok to cry.(well not about everything cuz then your just a pansy.)
