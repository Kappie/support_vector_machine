I can barely think these last few days, and sleep is becoming more and more needed. But to think.......11 more day 1's and 11 more day 2's and school's over. Well exams but then school's over. Exams are a breeze anyways. Ergh....but this is when intense schoolage happens. Like today....  Senior band..we got music night on Thursday and Intermediates tomorrow. I just hope we sound good. This morning we had a 1.5 hour rehearsal, though it was a late start day, but regardless I still had to be at school by 730am. Argh.....so early...but it's worth it for senior band I think sometimes. Sound so much better than intermediate....and much more productive. So we ran through pieces this morning, and got out at 910, just before class started *late start day.* Oh yes and of course...morning routine before going to school hehe forgot to mention but yes it did occur =P.  History class......Ms. Manson had to go to a track meet so she quickly assigned us to our groups for the final year end group project, and then left. Hmm....well I'm doing present day Canadian Economics. Wow....our dollar sucks and gas prices make buses look more and more appealing each day. I mean subway is self explanitory to look good......but BUSES?! AND LONDON BUSES!? *shudder.* Stupid gas prices. Hmm...my group pretty much is people I've never worked with, so can't really say much about them. Maisie's with....uhh....some other group? lol. Hmm...so yeah not much in history. Chose groups and then bell rang...  Civics class: We didn't do anything for first half with no teacher, but Mr. Baldwin eventually came in after realizing he had an on-call. Actually he was pretty funny today...had some good jokes that made most of the class crack up. Then he left....and another teacher came in *Mr. Brown?* or sometin like that. We did more debating....I didn't talk much *GASP* and just sat there reading the proposed bills each class made for civics. Hmm....Marijuana legalization, Same Sex Marriage, Euthanasia, and some other ones. *Shrug* easy debating issues I find. Oh well....but that's for next day. For now....  LUNCH! Jasper's...had some sorta pasta that cost me 5 bucks. Just found out Mophead's meal everyday would normally cost 4 bucks for me....and it is a lot more filling. But Alfredo pasta is SOOOO good... Ugh descisions descisions.  Beats BK though where every burger just looks like a different form of grease =P.  Ok summarizing rest of my day:  Math Programming Home.  Yup...that's pretty much it. Use your imagination to fill them in. I'll help with a few things though. Example A: While I was doing science h/w today, I had to go outside and stare at my garden and somehow manage to make up and ecosystem. While doing this process...a bumble bee comes by...and for anyone that doesn't know me I HATE BEES. So seeing it....and it approaching closer and closer I turn and flee....eventually hiding behind my minivan in hopes the bumblebee is out of my testing area for lifeforms. After doing that....I ran inside then....and finished my project behind a window. Event B: Played ball w/ Patrick for a bit....I WON! HAH! Oh yes and also no drumsticks at the moment as for some reason they've gone missing.  Anywho.....use your imagination for the rest. Studyin' for bio then I'm out.  By the way Jenn.....REAL sorry to hear your blog went BOKAN! to the extreme. Mine kinda did...but I'm salvaging what i can =S. Ugh shoulda listened to Jason. Yet again he is right in life *shakes fist.*  Later.
