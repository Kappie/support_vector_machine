Only none of it was for me. *laugh*  There is something so great about spending other people's money, but at the same time, when I have all these cool new computers sitting in my living room, it's hard to think about how I don't get to keep them.  Built 2 brand new computers for professors at the university/college I work at last night, upgraded the machine my Jenny's brother owns and am about to repair my roomates machine.  No profit or anything, just something nice to do for the people in my life, so they can save a few bucks.  Keeps me out of trouble I suppose too. *laugh* Besides, I will enjoy the look on their faces when they see their new computers. People generally like new toys and gizmos, so this should give them all something to be happy about at the very least.  Church tonight and tomorrow morning. Singing my heart out as usual. Then tomorrow is a special day for Jenny and I. 6 months since we mutually expressed our feelings and desires to move beyond plutonic friendship. *smile* Jenny is excited. That REALLY makes me happy. I love her so much some days it hurts.  Lots more going on really, but I don't feel too expressive right now. Meh.  Shalom.  Rooster
