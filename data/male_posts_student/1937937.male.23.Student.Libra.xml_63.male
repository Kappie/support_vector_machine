We were enjoying the scenery – the Rickenbacker Causeway which leads to Key Biscayne, and glimpses of the city shrouded in the sunset light.  My apartment is oriented in such a way that from it’s balcony, I can see the edge of downtown, but the skyscrapers in the center of the city are hidden from view.  The building across the way from me is under construction, and its balconies have a clear view of downtown.  It just so happened that on this night, several guys were working on a balcony that was almost even with mine.  They were rough looking Hispanic guys – until the explosions started wracking the evening, I’d hardly noticed them.  It was sudden: downtown was echoing with the cracking, booming sound of heavy explosives.  After a few moments, the construction workers across the way began to shout:  “Hey, the building is on fire!”  They looked at me and gestured wildly towards downtown.  “I can see explosions!”  Terrorists.  I knew it.  I started scanning the sky for stray airplanes.  I could see a huge plume of smoke pealing out of downtown, orange lights flickering inside it.  Shit.  I turned to Carissa, and said: “We’ve got to get out of this building.  Quick, put your shoes on.”  I ran into the living room.  My roommate, Brad, was in the bathroom, taking a shower.  “Brad,” I shouted.  “Get the fuck out of the shower!”  “Why?”  “Because I said so, damn it!  Get out right now!”  I wasn’t holding back: this was my moment.  I was going to direct us all to safety.  I was born for this very instant.  It all became so clear.  “What’s going on?” Brad asked.  I could hear the shower water still running.  I was infuriated – couldn’t he tell I was trying to save his life?  Didn’t he understand that by wasting precious moments forcing me to convince him that it was necessary to get out of the shower, he was putting all our lives in jeopardy?  “Get the fuck out of the shower,” I screamed.  “I’ll explain it to you in a minute.”  Carissa had her shoes on, she handed me mine.  I slipped them on and waited a moment.  Then, I decided I was going to be a true hero.  “You go down,” I said to Carissa.  “Don’t wait for us.”  She nodded and headed out the door with Pooka, our Chihuahua.  I went back on the balcony, waiting for Brad.  I called to the construction workers.  “Is the building still burning?”  They ignored me.  Strange.  A moment later, Brad stepped out of the bathroom, in his boxers.  “What’s going on?” he asked.  I explained, briefly, that we were under attack by terrorists and I didn’t have any more details.  He nodded.  “Okay then,” he said, and went back into the bathroom to put his clothes on.  Then, like an angel from beyond, Carissa re-appeared in the doorway, bearing a message.  “The guy down the hall says it’s fireworks,” she said.  “Fireworks?  But they said it was on fire,” I said, pointing to the construction workers.  “I think they were messing with you, Rob,” Carissa said.  And like that, my moment of glory was snuffed out – I became the fool.  There were no terrorists.  I went back out onto the balcony and looked again – a puff of firework smoke was drifting off towards the horizon, carrying my dreams of being hero away into the sunset.
