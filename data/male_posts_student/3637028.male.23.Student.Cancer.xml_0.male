I knew I'd have no chance of seeing it in St. Louis because we only get the big budget pieces of crap that Hollywood shoves down your throat for your "enjoyment."  We get the occasional art-house or indie film picture, but not the amount that we should have. Anyway, I forgot about this poster until I was browsing through Blockbuster recently looking for anything that would be interesting and I happened to see the reduced version of the poster I had seen many months ago.  I'm sure you're asking yourself right now, "What the hell is this all about?"  Here's a quick synopsis of the film:   Elvis is alive and living in a retirement home in Texas.  Another of the residents is a black man who believes he is JFK.  The two have to team up to stop a mummy from ancient Egypt from sucking the souls out of their fellow residents.   That was enough for me to want to find out what this was all about, and then I discovered that Bruce Campbell (star of the "Evil Dead" series) played Elvis.  I realized that I HAD to see this film.  I'm not going to tell you any more about the movie.  I'd be spoiling it for you.
