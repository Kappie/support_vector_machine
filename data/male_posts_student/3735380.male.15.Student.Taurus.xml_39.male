All of them are over 13.  At another poll, It the statistics seem to be more interesting.  Have you been kissed yet? Most people over 13 years old say they have not had their first kiss yet. That is about one third.  The other third has had his/her first kiss before he/she entered high school.  The final one-fourth had their kisses during high school, while a tiny percent had the kiss after high school. It's a really interesting poll, and I suggest you take part in it. (You must be a registered member to vote though.)  So if you're over 13 and haven't had your kiss, there's a good chance you're perfectly normal.   urlLink The poll can be viewed by clicking this text.
