Anyone at all?  You! I like you! You you you!   me : why is it always about who I like? what about who do YOU like?  Nice move.   ac : Me? No one...  She doesn't like me... I wasn't expecting it anywa-   ac : Or maybe I just won't tell you.  What sort of games are you playing, woman?   me : Oh darn. Wait, don't you like that  hd  guy?  No, she doesn't. Whatever. Just make conversation.   ac : No way!  Alright, I believe you. I think I'll just keep being a shmuck about it though.   me : Whatever you say.  ac : I'm serious!  me : Its okay... I'm not gonna say anything...  ag : I really can't... I mean, I'm not even sure...  What are you talking about? You can't what?   me : you really cant what?  ac : I really can't tell you... it would ruin everything.  No it wouldn't. Tell me!   ac : Sort of...  me : I really dont think it would, but I'm sure you know what you're doing. Pulling more and more out of your ass.  ac : I wish I could tell you... I would, but like my best friend likes him too...  Wait a second... her best friend? kg likes me, and they're best friends so...    me : Whatever.  No, dammit. Tell her you like her!   me : Anyway, I like you.  Stupid stupid stupid. What is wrong with you? How could you possibly think she likes you? Out of all people. Really, pull it together man. Just tell her you're kidding.   ac : Right.  This is your chance. You could blow it all off right here--   me : No no, I do.  *smacks head against keyboard*   ac : Of course you like me, we're great friends. You like me as a friend. I know that.  She's trying to let you out easy! Just take the bait! Make it into a joke somehow!   me : No, look. I like you as a friend, but then I like you.. like... the other kind of "I like you."  Real like, smooth like, you know, um, wording there. You had the easy way out, and you blew it. Theres no way to explain this and not look like a complete asshole. Good job.   ac : You're... kidding me, right? You like me more than a friend?  Augh. Its all over...   me : Yeah, totally.  Totally? What the hell are you thinking? You're just on a roll today.   ac : "Yeah, totally" to the first or second question?  me : The second one.  me : ac, yes. I do like you more than a friend. I have feelings for you.  ac : Woah. Thats so cool. I'm such a loser... Whatever that means...  me : I'm a bit confused, but alright.  ac : Me too, why are YOU confused?  me : The whole part about me liking you being cool, and you being a loser. That didn't quite click. Look, I sort of figured out that you don't like me... We can just talk about something else.  A real man accepts defeat. Dammit. Dammit. Dammit.   ac : No, I do like you, I just didn't want to say anything...  And the rest, as they say, is history. This was a conversation we had online, but of course, I added in proper spelling and grammar, merged IMs, etc. to make it easier to read. We agreed that it was too late in the year to go out or anything, as my family goes away for the whole summer. I'm not happy about this at all, but thats for another entry. Anyway, I'm feeling quite elated right now. I know theres still the issue with  kg , and I had to promise not to tell her, but I think there still may be some action going on at a party or something... Either way,  kg  didn't bring it up to me even though she was online all afternoon, so maybe she won't say anything afterall...  Oh, by the way, I hope you like the new logo thats been put up. In case anyone is wondering, the font is called "Whiffy."
