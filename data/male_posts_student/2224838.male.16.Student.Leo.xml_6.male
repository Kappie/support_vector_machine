I'm not really that fond or even familiar with Macs, for that matter, but I have been learning more about them while working on the newspaper this year. I don't know that I would ever want to own one myself, but there are some pretty cool things about them. As an added bonus with the iMacs, Apple sent a few copies of none other than Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. I think my addiction to the game has quickly worn off, but I have a feeling that there won't be much work going on for a while.  On a different topic, my journalism advisor received an advanced screening copy of the movie  urlLink  Shattered Glass  . It's about a journalist from the  New Republic  who fabricated most of his stories and ended up paying the price. Since it's related to journalism, my advisor may let us watch it in class sometime.
