I've been getting fatter, more angry at journalism and more sure that I really like Che Guevera.  So my friend helped me to start a blog.  I thought it would give me something to do that would make me fatter and increase my love of Che, but at the same time keep me away from the news.  So far, so good.  Thanks.
