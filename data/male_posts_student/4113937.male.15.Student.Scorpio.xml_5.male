So tomorrow, we will be able to do well! ALL THE BEST EVERYONE! haha.. some words of encouragement.. or else.. haha..       today school was quite boring because the lesson we had today is not really very interesting and worthwhile.  Only the history and math i think so far i found it useful for thursday.  Wanted to go home during english period and decided not to, haha.. overall it quite boring from there onwards.      after school, we got the tanglin idol thingy at the parade square and then in the classroom, there is also SC thingy in the hall, overall both also quite important. So is quite a busy day tomorrow, national day..  haha..       Just when i was updating the blog,  she message me and wish me good luck! haha.. ;)      went home around 9pm like that, really tired out and don't feel like going to school tomorrow. but i cannot.. damn sian.. haha.. okay.. shall not complain if not i will feel more sian about it.. haha..       tomorrow had to reach school around 6.15am.. it was like so early, nevermind.. haha.. shall not complain.. haha.. nitez everyone!
