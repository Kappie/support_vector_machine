WRONG! the best part of the date was deffidently after the date! me n julie were in the back of the car just kinda laying there (or atleast we tryed, its a pretty small car). jays just driving around for the hell of it. me n julie were just all over each other the whole time. if i was sitting in the passenger seat looking back i would describe what i saw as 2 people kissing like animals at first. but then it kinda slowed down, got a lil more passionate. i would open my eyes every now n then n all i would see was just her face illuminated by a street light every few seconds. our arms were around each other holding each other as close as we could. i dont no how long it lasted, but it was like being in heaven. i remember laying there for a bit, my arm around her waiste, she had her face in my neck n i was playing with her hair, n i remember thinking...i cant believe i have something like this again so soon. hell its better then what i ever had before. i wished me n her could just stay in each others arms forever, n i get the feeling that she felt the same way.
