Like I said I want to be wrong, but Carpenter will probably not keep up this pace." -July 10, 2004  The Cardinals witnessed first hand the old adage, "Good pitching beats good hitting."  Kerry Wood's dominance of the Cardinals through 5 innings (Baker being careful on Wood because he just came off the DL) is just a taste of the power a dominate pitcher brings to the table.  St. Louis has 1. Hitting 2. Bullpen (So far) 3. Speed 4. Fielding 5. Power, but not a dominate starter.  Matt Morris is extremely streaky, and unfortunately can no longer be counted among baseball's top tier of SP's.    Pipe dream of the week: acquire Randy Johnson.  He would look very "Ek" like in the Cardinal uni.   -CJ
