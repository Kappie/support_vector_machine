Recently got an e-mail from the geocities people saying that they would delete my site if I didn't update it, so I slapped together something about Santa being evil. Enjoy! The link is over there somewhere, you know...  The bathroom is  actually  finished now. Nothing beats the sensation of not having to go into the cold outdoors to have a nice warm shower.  And at last count I have to read about 5 novels over these 2 weeks, of which I have in my posession 1, and of which I have finished none, so don't be surprised (whoever you are...) if I don't post very often.  Going to see Spiderman 2 tomorrow. My brother said it was boring and crap, so I'm expecting a good film!  Oh, and can anyone tell me who is having the phone conversation at the end of the Outro for the  urlLink Limp Bizkit  Album, Hot Dog Flavoured Water and the Chocolate Starfish?
