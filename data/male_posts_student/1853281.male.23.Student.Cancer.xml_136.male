Not that there is anything wrong with women, being womenly, or anything estrogen related.(I could never feel that, being raised among Amazons as i was) But i seem to be particularly female recently, and that is rather odd. I really want to watch a soccer or rugby game, have a few beers, go camping, chop wood, oh i don't know anything to regain the last shreds of testosterone i have. But am not sure what to do. I am beginning to wilt, being stuck out here in the suburbs, and there are still five more days to go. Housesitting rots, especially when one has no car
