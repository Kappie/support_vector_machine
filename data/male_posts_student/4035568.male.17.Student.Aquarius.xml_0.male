Well, she decides that it would be a good idea to quote unquote...(sorry I prefer to tpye it that way lol....) embaress me...now doing this action is a very tough one indeed I must say. Her way of going about doing this is very thought out and well planned..well not really but that just gets your attention more. She does the thing that is so embaressing it could kill your perfect rep completely...well not really but close enough to it. Ok I bet you I'm making you go What IS IT!?!?! Ok, my mother, is driving down College St. takes a left turn at the second stop light, and then a right turn at the next. Now this road that we are traveling down now is old 68, which has BP Sloan center right beside it, next thing I know the windows are going down and she reaches for the remote to the cd player...I'm sitting there thinking..now what is wrong with this woman. She changes the cd player to her 70's Funk Music CD and blasts it. I know exactly what is coming next...we get near BP and she puts on her left turn signal and pulls into BP...I'm as low as I could possibly get in my Mom's 4 door hunter green 01' Ford Windstar SE. Yes...a mini van....I was rding with my mom cruising the BP!!!! THANK YOU MOTHER! Yes....you got that right...she did move up to my #1 slot on my ever so long hit list! No Keisha you didn't lose everything..I saved a close 2nd place for you!! A......HA! I thought it was amusing....oh well, I need to go puke... I think I will never go out again...If anybody is out there tell my friends I lived a good life and that I love them..but my social life is about to commit suicide.       ~Later Dayz~
