I still have a ways to go, though. Last night was great, my dad and I went to Shreffler's snack shack for their cruise in. The burnouts were amazing, it was just zoom zoom zoom one after another. I can't wait until a week from now, when I will be going to night camp. That will be fun. Staying up late, hanging out with all the peoples I know, like Central, Zack, and Deanna. It should prove interesting seeing all the peeps that were there last year, and of course all the newbies. I feel obligated to write about Andrea because she was gracious and kind enough to write about me in her blog. I mean, there is not much to write about, we had a nice long chat tonight, that's about it. Talking to her is always fun. Tomorrow I have to work on my car some more. I should probably go to bed soon so I can get up early enough to get cracking on my car. I can't wait until it is done. It will be really fun taking people off road. I remember when Mike Atkinson would take Micheal and me off road in his bug. He is the guy who started my brother on getting his bug ready for off road. I can't wait to join them. My car is all built for it, too. I can't wait until I get 3x3 trailing arms for it. That should put the stance nice, especially with longer shocks. And, when I twist the spline a few notches, that should bring that rear up like an angry cat. The front end, I don't need to do much. I just need to preload the spline a couple notches, I should be fine. Of course, the real thing that should help it is the huge tires I plan to put on it. 32 inches for the back would be awesome, buggy tires so that they are nice and wide. Of course, it really doesn't matter how wide the fronts are, in fact, the skinnier the better. They just need to be tall. When I connect the front beam to the bumper, and the front beam to the roll bar, which is connected to the center tunnel, the body, and the whole rear end, that will make the whole car integrated. It will be plenty safe jumping, and rolling it wouldn't be a worry. I am not sure yet if I want to put nerf bars on it. I suppose it is almost necessary. Ah well. After I have the body done, the fun part comes in doing the electronics. I plan to use a different harness, so as to make it reliable, especially with the larger wires. It will certainly be a beast when I am done with it. I just hope it will have enough power. A little 1600 is not exactly a pulling machine. It would be the bomb if I could fit in a type 4 engine, a 2.0 liter instead of a 1.6. Of course, the ultimate of ultimates that I would do if I could would be sticking in a vr6. Yeah, like that will ever happen! It would be next to impossible. I will just have to do with what I have to work with for now. Ah, dreaming of a vr6. Good night.
