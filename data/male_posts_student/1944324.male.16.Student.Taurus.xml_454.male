Thomas must see The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra before it leaves Castleton Arts since he so totally wrote it. Also is it wrong that I find the fact that Marten got stood up by the Comstocks and I absolutely hilarious. By the way, Nathan made two mysterious bathroom trips.  I have SpongeBob Uno! Yay!  Why shake hands when we can shake...other things? Like Lips.
