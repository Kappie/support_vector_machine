Now then, we all decided that in order to spice up the story a bit, it should be rewritten as a Matrix movie. HOW KICKASS WOULD THAT BE?!? Like Darnay is Neo, Lucie is Trinity, Dr. Manette is Morpheus- HOLY SHIT I THINK I JUST PINCHED A LOAF!!! THINK OF THE POSSIBILITIES!!!! buutttttttt.... then I remembered that I'm a lazy procrastinator who has the attention span of a 3 year old with down syndrome. Perhaps that explains why I'm so slow to update my BLOG. Anyways... I thought it was a good idea. School's almost out- WOOHOOO!!!                Day two in my search for female sustenance has been futile. I'm still horn..errr HUNGry and stuff. Yep...not many chicks to choose from at our school. Imagine you're in a supermarket but all they sell are three kinds of bread- Untouchable, Skanky, and Bitch. Then if you're really nice to the guy behind the counter and you wink at him a little, he may show you their secret and limited stash of Perfect bread...ALL OF WHICH IS ALREADY SOLD!!!  DAMNIT!!!!       But I am talking to this one chick...but shes taken.  SURPRISE SURPRISE , NO?!? oh well...she asked me to say that she was (warning these may not be true because she tends to exaggerate): shes so pleasant, good, kind, polite, fine, hott, sexy, pretty, gorgeous, attractive, good looking, beautiful, cute, appealing, sweet, nice looking, cool, funny, fun to hang out with((even though we dont)), fashionable, arousing, so incredibly nice because she came to my play,overwhelming, grand, breathtaking, splendid, remarkable, amazing, marvelous, awe-inspiring, astounding, humbling...and kind of skanky. KIDDING, KIDDING! She's not that polite. BADOOMBANG! Once again, just kidding- he isn't  THAT  skanky. *wink*    NOW GET ME THE HELL OUTTA HERE!!!!!!
