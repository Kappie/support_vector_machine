I also must show those of you who are familiar with Triangle and Robert, namely Nathan and Jonah, my new parody.  I got bored in math and started drawing polygons, and it turned into an alternate T universe.  Enter: Thomas and Rhombus.  Its not just a crappy hack of the origional, Ive got interesting ideas, it works. just read it.  Its wacky and absurd in a whole new sense of the word(s).  I don't like Phillipy.  I do like showing him up with well done assignments.  The battle continues.  History is a giant crack.   Sorry, I couldn't help myself
