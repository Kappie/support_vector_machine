Marathon is the first title of a serie of 3 chapters (Marathon,  Durandal  and  Infinity ).  So basically, Marathon is  Bungie 's early attempt to Fps (before  Halo ). If you want a feel of what Bungie did before the  xbox  hit blockbuster, now is the time.  What i propose here is completely legal, the build is out of  Source Forge  and come with the free license and stuff so you won't get into any problems. This game was a  Mac  game, so it may not run perfectly on your pc.  Here are the files you need in order to start playing Aleph One - Marathon.   -Marathon Source code-  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/marathon/AlephOne-Windows-20040417.zip?download  -Aleph One's Marathon Port-  http://orbitalarm.bungie.org/downloads/alephone.html    ---Details on how to install---  Windows : Just download both zip files and extract them. Just copy Marathon file into Alephone file and go in marathon, just click the icon. Important : Windows user download the Special Windows Version of Aleph one on the website.  Mac Os 9 : Same thing, but you also need the latest version of SDL library (1.2 if possible) extracted in the alephone directory. ---   Understand that i cannot provide support for the Mac users, your on your own. I have been able to make it work easily on Windows, so should you.  If you have questions about the game that i cannot answer, try on bungie.net
