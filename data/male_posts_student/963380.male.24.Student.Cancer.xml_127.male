She had this bizarre paranoid fear of Native Americans (not the modern kind, the ones with the headresses and the scalping) which I exploited via the Tomahawk Chop and tribal rhythms pounded out on any flat surface while she was around. Apparently that one has passed and now we're on to Meatlof.  This means one thing and one thing only: I have begun to give virtuoso performances of such classics as Paradise by the Dashboard Light and I would do anything for love.  Truly I am the God of Sex and drums and rock and roll.  Oh Yes.
