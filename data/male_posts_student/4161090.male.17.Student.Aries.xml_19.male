But instead, the greatest fallacy?  And deep inside the very soul burns With the same energy that feeds the sun For this soul of man refuses to believe That life is but a thousand compounds of carbon And all the weight comes down to life A heart? A brain? A conscience? A soul?  What is that mystic spark that fuels a man? Little choice but to accept ‘life’ as a whole  And life alone makes the mind go supernova For with beautiful life alone began it all And life alone is the thing that brings death And a considering mind’s downfall And after all that the answer hits you What if life is just god dreaming? But then your blood curdles as you wonder What if life is just god screaming…  …for all Eternity? -Aditya MJ
