I normally wake up rather quickly, jump out of bed, and immediately begin planning out my day.  Today, it took me around five minutes -- I'm feeling a little behind.  Regardless, allow me to introduce myself to all of you -- whoever you are.  Chances are I know you.  I either work with you, go to school with you, or have done one of those things in the past with you.  Those are all acceptable to me.  So, to begin, as the "profile" aspect of this little gem seems to be lacking, allow yourself to bend thy seeing ear my way as I explain to you my most hidden desires, thoughts, and plaintive moods -- or to be more pedestrian about it, I shall explain my profile.  To begin... "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is my favorite movie.  Why?  I'm glad you didn't ask, but I'll tell you anyway.  First of all, the movie is beautifully rendered on a visual level -- the land and city-scapes are gorgeous.  They give the film a very palpable fairy-tale (or for the pretentious, "faerie-tale") mystique.  Compounded with the visual elements, the characters are realized in very human terms... they all have very glaring weaknesses (although not necessarily flaws except in Jen's case) which made them very sympathetic to me.  Overall, the depiction of China was a very romantic one, and it swept me into that blue lagoon that is the history-sized sky of China. HOWEVER, the permeating theme of the movie is not so romantic as its superficial layers.  It indicts the male-dominated society of ancient China, and also criticizes its self-oppressive and repressive customs.  Despite their greatest strengths, the story is ultimately a tragedy -- with the fatal blows being struck not by human hands, but by the sweeping brush of human fundamentalism.  "It should always be acceptable to love somebody", begs the film.  Ready for more?  I mean, you've already read this far.  You might as well finish up.  I mean, why not read the whole post?  It's only his second post, he's excited.  He goes off on tangents sometimes.  In the future, maybe he'll develop a more stream-lined and accomodating mode of narration... so I'll give him a chance now.  He seems smart enough, and those eyes... those eyes...  What do I do?  Well, if you're reading this now, as in the day I wrote it, you know what I do.  I walk around our bookstore and tell you what to do.  Actually, I don't tell a whole lot of people what to do.  I don't like to... besides, whenever people tell me to do something, I don't do it.  I think most people are like that.  So I either don't tell people to do stuff, or I tell them to do it in a funny way so it doesn't actually seem like I'm telling anyone to do anything.  So far, my modern day mind-sorcery has worked... no has gotten wise yet... and fuck it, people can figure out shit on their own anyway.  I've got a blog to work on, goddammit!  Other than that, what else about me?  Some basics: I try to keep clean.  I noticed yesterday that I began to stink, and it really pissed me off.  I hate stinking, and I hate being dirty.  If I seem to be in a bad mood, it is invariably because I either feel dirty or I feel like I stink.  The best way to get me out of a bad mood is to either say, "you look clean" or "you smell nice".  If I detect a lie, your punishment will be delivered swiftly and without mercy.  I'd like to point out, almost in summary, that this blog is about me.  Only me.  That's weird.
