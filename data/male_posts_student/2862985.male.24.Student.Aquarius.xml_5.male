Actually its because her foster is coming only this saturday to fetch her and Kailing couldn't keep her at her house any longer (as she already has a dog at home and her mum starts to nag at her.) and hence Cass and Kai have to ask for my help. Well, I couldn't have been happier to have a dog again! Its only my mum thats the main problem. But still I manage to convince her and help to put up Brownie for the next two days.   Actually I really really love dogs a lot. They are not known as man's best friend for nothing ok?!  I used to have a German Shepherd a few years back. His name is Jacky. That time, whenever I feel very low or down, I would talk to him and he seems to understand me. Thats how I started to form a special relationship with Jacky. When he passed away due to old age, I was very very sad. Its like someone close to me has left me forever. After his death I have not got myself another dog. I do not want to have that feeling again..... Sighz.. (Thinking and missing Jacky now...)  Today is actually a very normal day. Went to school in the afternoon to collect the Visual Studio.Net CDs. After that, went to John Little to buy the thermal flask as they are having sale now. Then went to Ang Mo Kio Library to return my books which are due tomorrow. Hee, tell you one secret. I do not know where to return the books and have to ask a little kid in the library where to return the books... Haha, so "malu". But cannot blame la, its my first time there to return books. Normally I don't return.. keke..:P  Played a lot with Brownie just now. Very tired as she makes me run round the whole estate. She ran out of our gate when we opened it and I have to chase her around like a mad man.. Haha.. but well, a good workout though... Its been a long time since I run for such a long distance... :P  Too bad Brownie is just going to stay with me for another one more day. Sighz.. think I already can't bear to see her leave already.. but well, tian1 xia4 wu2 bu4 san4 zhi1 yan2 xing2, that applies to humans, more so for dogs. So guess I just have to wish her happiness with her new master ... Brownie, stay happy and cute always!!!  P.S. Porto won yesterday! Yeh!! Hurray!! Although my heart wants Monaco to win, but well, you can't possibly work against $$, can you? Hee..:P
