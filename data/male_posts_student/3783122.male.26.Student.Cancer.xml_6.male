Ahhh, beer at last! Our weekend didn’t start until those burgers and red peppers hit the grill.          So, after a few beers and a lot of absolute mixed with very little pink-lemon aid we headed out to the local Karaoke place.      See we had this master plan. We still had all this beer left over; seeing as how it cost so much at the bar to drink and both of us are poor college students, we decided to take it in the car with us. Only one problem….. We forgot the opener. So, imagine the two of us out there trying to open up beer on the curb or a light post. I’m sad to say that our efforts had the net loss of about 60% a bottle. There had to be a better way. Anyway not really to concerned about the loss at the moment we headed back inside to sing a bit with my friends (all of whom are old enough to be my grandparents or parents) Ron, Lilly, Brandon and the rest of the gang. I sing a few and Ben and I go back to the car and eureka I figure out how to open up the beer with just using a key and a lot of pressure. YEAH 100% return on the discovery! See what college is teaching me. At least I can say that I am the one paying for it myself. We were now well on our way to skunk as a drunk. As our night progressed the more frequent the trips to the car became. When you mix young men and beer together you get instant testosterone / machismo level spikes which no medical device can measure. Ben could have taken me for a good $10 but he reduced the bet to shots. He knew I was going to lose. Sad to say I can not throw a bottle across a 50 yard gap while drunk and the empty bottle ended up in the Manitowoc River. Ben gets a call so I head back in to get us a round of Yeager. While sitting there I talk to the bar tender and have a pretty nice talk with her. That is when fate played her hand and Andrea called me. So picture this Ben and myself are outside on the phones to both of our girls. She begins to tell me that she misses my kisses and misses me. She said that it really hit home with her just then when she herd me laughing. (At Ben’s and my situation with the cell phones) That is when she started to say that she really missed my laugh. It’s tough to hear someone say that to you when you miss them so bad it hurts. I told her that she was always on my mind. Well, we got off the phone and I went back in. Ben came back in and we had our shots and went back to being our usual goofy selves. With a few more shots down we headed to the Country Kitchen which is the only place open at two in the morning in Manty. The best meal when you are shit faced is the Country Skillet. It’s a mammoth skillet shaped porcelain platter piled high with ham, bacon, cheese, eggs and sausage and a beagle on the side. After that we headed home and promptly passed out.
