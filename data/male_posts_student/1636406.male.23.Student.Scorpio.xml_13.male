A bunch of fat, depressed, confused housewives give their bodies over to the  urlLink Fox Broadcasting Company  in order to be hacked up, abused, and caked with hooker makeup in order to compete with each other for some crappy-ass prizes!  It is sheer marketing genius.  There is nothing more enjoyable than seeing stupid people do very stupid things.  Now for my little rant: The finale was so rigged it wasn't even funny- it was stinkingly obvious. I knew Rachel would win after seeing the first episode- why? Because she was the prettiest so they put her on first to get people to watch the show. Rachel was also much taller than all the other girls, which for whatever reason goes far towards winning a modeling contract.  So the show was rigged! A shock to everyone I'm sure. I am keeping my fingers crossed that next seasons girls are fatter and uglier and require even more hacking and slashing.  Hell I have an even better idea: take a bunch of men that want to be women, give them a sex change and hormone therapy, then throw them in a beauty contest facing them off against The Swans... that would be my ultimate show.  FOX Execs if you read this and you like the idea give me a call-- I'd make a great producer.
