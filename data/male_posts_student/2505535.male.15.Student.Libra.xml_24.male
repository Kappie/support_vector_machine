Saturday morning I did 3 and 1/2 hours of Tai Chi, which was fun, then when I got back Charl came round, we played video games and drank tea.  Today, Charl, Jen and Charm came round, that was fun, we watched some  urlLink ATHF  and south park and managed to play some Sonic Shuffle that was most fun. Excellent.  Oh yeh, Monster Magnet are playing here soon, and so are Fantomas, RAWK! =D
