So give me a call back tomorrow, okay? Bye!"  now, any other guy would jump on the opportunity to catch a flick, but i'm smarter than that. yeah, i know what's going on with that shit. i bet she's not even going with anyone. yeah that's it. she's just trying to use telepathic powers to psych the shit out of me. five bucks says somehow everyone else will miraculously not be able to go, and it'll be just me and her. no bitch, you can't seduce me. HA! i'll kick her ass if she doesn't maintain at least 200ft away from me. she's never seen kung-fu like my kung-fu. yeah i sent a guy to the fuckin' hospital, so don't mess with my ass. a wise man once said, "  GET OFF MY PIECE!"     besides, i'm heading my ass to the engine room to have myself a goodass time. that's right, baby,  edgebrook:live ! i mean, i start my week downloading mp3s from apache servers owned by people i don't even know and end it with some good ol' ska. now that's a bitchin' week, kids. even though there are some people  urlLink  MISSING IN ACTION  , this week was pretty damn good. i mean, even though i cried myself to sleep for two weeks (sike!), cut my wrists more than usual (double-sike!), and received lots of bitchy voicemail, i think i'm a fuckin' trooper for surviving that shit. after all the asskicking is done by edgebrook, i'll head on over to the luxurious razo manor to have yet another goodass time doing who know's what. but i mean you can't beat having razo's butler pampering your ass as you demand ricecake after ricecake. i mean, the man has toilets made of  solid gold .  boys and girls, that's how you do it.   Update: my parents suck ass.
