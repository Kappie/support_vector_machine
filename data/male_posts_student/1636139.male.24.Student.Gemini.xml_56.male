On Friday, we had the last bash of the year to toast the departure of the Fall interns. I was up until 2am packing but was able to board my flight with no major hiccups. 
  
I guess it's only appropriate to make a few closing comments about my experience working in Silicon Valley. The biggest difference for me was the complete dependence upon cars; If I am able to return, I've decided to take up driving. I also found most of the Canadian myths about the pushy ignorant Americans to be rather exaggerated; they're not as different from us as we'd like to believe; well, at least not in Northern California. It must have something to do with that fact that the ethnic diversity in The Valley (and ,to a lesser extent, the entire state) is very high.
