I fucking up, and it's my fault. i got like a 38 percent in earth science, which is EXTREMELY SAD, and i'm still fucking failing Math.  Plus, i don't know if my AP Englsh DCA is gonna go through or not.  What the fuck? all this shit is fucking happening so mother fucking fast.  oday, i fucking stay after to do a quiz for math right? NOT, i was just garunteeing another fucking failing test, its fucking unbelivealbe, i wasn't there for 3 days, didn't even KNOW there was a quiz, and all of a sudden, i'm expected to do one.  shit man...and what the fuck is up with all these chicks? lol, i mean, lol, holy shit, it's just fucking incredible. If you look at some of my first entries, i rant about chicks SO MUCH, it's to sad for me to even look at anymore, and now all of a sudden, i'm apparently hot stuff. wtf is that about? i mean, i'm saying i don't appreciated by it, i'm flatered, i really am, but it's juss soo wierd, ya know? i guess it's cause i never really saw myslef as "hot" or "sexy"...my license plate is just a joke...but i mean, shit, today, even TARA.....tara winkler...like, probably, the most sexually active and diverse person in that damn school was even getting alittle crazy.  holy shit....and thats not adding some other ones that i as told of, and by.  but whatever, i juss wanted to get that off my chest, it was juss to crazy.    um....whatelse...one more day of school left. Thurs is a half a day, and frida and monday we have off...definitly needed before the end of the year.  On thursday i'm suppose to go to Victory with Andy.  It should be intesting...and on friday, were having the Lan party at Czanks house.  Now, the official numbers are foggy, but as of now, i heard 16 people... 16 PEOPLE !! that by far, the biggest i would be going to, and i'm sure it would be for most of the guys too.  i mean, at jonese, the most we had on computers at one time was about 5, or 6, depending.  and i mean, that took ALOT of room, but 16 fucking people!!?!?! thats gonna fucking rock, i don't even care who's coming. And apparently were gonna have like a BBQ too, so thats just the icing on the cake.  The krew is suppose to make an appearance, and thats all i know of.  But i know alot of people have plans.  Like i know Jorge is gonna go to Playland with some people.  Besides, i remeber Dan talking about double dating with jorge judith, him, and a "special" person. lol, unfortunatly, i think i already know who that is, but i could be wrong.  Because of that fact, i ain;t saying names.    i was looking at all the people in the school and realized, i'm gonna miss the seniors.  I mean, i'm not mr. popular, knowing EVERY SINGLE ONE of them, but i mean, i know enough...it's juss soo wierd to picture school with out em'.  But i guess that's how it goes.  If i know them, i'd know enough that i'lll see em' at summer school.  I can't fucking belive i fucked up again..i'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ubeleiveablyy pissed. Fuck that typo.    i'm pretty sure mike was pissed when he heard of my new rule.  It's a buck fifty a ride if u wanna ride to lunch with me.  but after carful consideration, i brought it down to 75 cents.  Don't like it? blow me.  you juss don't seem to recognize my situation.  I don't live a lavish life of 4 bedroom houses, and nice cars.  I live in a SMALL ASS BASEMENT APARTMENT with 2 small ass bedrooms and a bathroom.  thats it.  so off the bat, i don't really have alot of money.  thats number one. number 2, is that i don't pay for my gas.  i don't work, so my parents not only hook me up witht he gas money, but also my lunch moeny. thats 2.  3 is very simple.  My mom juss graduated again from mercy, so she's not working right now.  wanna know why? Cause she has to do feild work before she can start working, therefor he not only has to pay for like almost EVERYTHING, but now, even the rent and shit.  aand to top it off, my car isn;t exaclty the most fule efficient ride around.  ok? so if any of you are wondering, thats it.  75 cents.  Unless i'm going your way.  simple as that.  I need the fucking money.  U think thats stupid? u think that's unfair? u think thats selfish? u think thats not very friendly? read the second sentence of this paragraph....   i'm done...i need to sleep or something.
