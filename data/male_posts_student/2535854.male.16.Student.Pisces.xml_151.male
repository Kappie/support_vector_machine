So in the morning had breakfast which for me wasnt nice..dont know how you ppl (Malaysians who are like this(read on) )can eat Nasi or mee for breakfast!Gawd!I still haven`t gotten used to that kind of thing..And haha had like 4cups of tea and 1 of coffee..watch it Steffi..i`m getting closer to you and your over caffeiness!
