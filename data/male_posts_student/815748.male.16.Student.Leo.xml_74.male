Here are a few of the changes:  New Format - New colors, proportions, fonts, for a better blogging experience.  Music - A soundtrack to your window into my weblife.  Mail - A mailto link on the right-hand side of the page for immediate contact with Mr. Dietz himself.  Dannon Quotes-on-the-Bottom - Alternating quotes or other musings running on the bottom of your window (usually the "status" bar).  Links - Expanded linkage to the coolest sites on the "interweb."  I hope you enjoy your visit.  Keep it real.
