I mean, the graphics are spiffy and sound is engrossing. I even jumped the first 8 or 9 times a monster jumped out at me. But after an hour and a half of the *exact* same thing, it begins to wear thin.    The description of this game was right, a remake of the original Doom, with new graphics. That's it. Nothing new in terms of gameplay. Sneak around. Get spooked. Empty your clip into a zombie. Move on to the next room. Ho-hum.    Glad I "tried it before I bought it."
