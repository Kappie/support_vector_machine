In Studio in Media Arts, this freshman Travis and I were throwing our tests in the air and predicted where they'd land...well I threw mine and it landed on the ground standing up on its side. Concidering it was extremely windy outside and the window was creaked open and the paper is very light, the chances of that happening are 1/10000...well I threw it again. It did it again! It stood up again! Then after the second time I heard an annoying beep in my ear. Then I tried it again and it wouldn't do it anymore. They fixed it. There was a glitch in that area, the gravity was fucked up in that spot. Maybe the wind messed up a computer source somewhere changing little things, and then they fixed it. That's what the beeping sound is. The point is, I won't stop looking for clues, until I find the truth. Wow, this new Puddle of Mudd song is godlike. AJ and I talked about how book worms are going to turn into computer worms and the expression "Don't judge a book by its cover" will turn into "Don't judge a computer by its modem." Other stuff happened but I'm too lazy, nothing exciting except Matt Kaiser got in trouble by the security guard for throwing stuff and Jay in the commons. I was so happy to hear it, the first time Kaiser gets in trouble. This day was pretty boring. Well, so long everyone.
