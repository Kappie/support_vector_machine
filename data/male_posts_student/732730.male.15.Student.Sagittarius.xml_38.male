For the past several years TAS has boasted very good OP band results (ie. 25% of all year 12 students recieved OPs in the 1-7 band).   For the uninitiated, the QCS test determines what OP positions are available at a school. That is, they determine what any student at a school gets, not what OP the test taker recieves.  By convincing people who wouldn't do as well to not sit the test, the OPs that can be given for TAS goes up. -->
