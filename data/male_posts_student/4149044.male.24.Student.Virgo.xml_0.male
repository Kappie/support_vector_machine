We started out looking for barstools at a skandinavian store and ended up wanting to buy everything else. I don't like a lot of the stuff we currently have but it's not like we can just throw it all away. So I'm not sure what we're going to do, though I already suggested we dump off some of the furniture at our house in Hugo. Since my dad is giving the place to me I really don't want it to look tacky or mismatched. Why spend a half mil on just a townhouse (half the price of our current house but  infinitely  smaller) only to furnish it with stuff that looks either out of place or just plain ugly. Don't get me wrong..we have a lot of nice shit right now, but I don't think some of it will look as good in such a small space. I'm already afraid the place will look like a freaking chinese antique shop.   Next week we're going to look at some plasmas for the living room. Our ancient 35" weighs 85,492lbs and takes up approximately one acre of space. We'll probably get rid of the oldass 35" and 30" Toshibas for those reasons alone..anyone need a tv?      I still feel so fucking stuffed from lunch. I was good on my diet for uhm  two  whole days. Damn I really need to workout.
