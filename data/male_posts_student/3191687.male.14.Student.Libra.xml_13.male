Just so long as I stay warm and safe and dry, life's pretty good.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      your the slang word crackin. used to greet everyone and everything. this one can be used for anything     urlLink Which slang word r u?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Uh...yeah...

Your one hell of a ass-kicker and nver let anyone get close to you.    urlLink   What type of eyes do you have?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     heheh   AH HA i knew it.  My dominate "emotion" is...    Apathy, well I can say your lucky, in some ways. You see Apathy is no emotion, basically you don't care. But that does not make you a bad person. Some of my friends are apathetic and I love them, but it wouldn't hurt to care a little more. Trust me life hurts, most people who are apathetic do it cause they were hurt. But don't worry, life is pain, its also pleasure. Good luck.
