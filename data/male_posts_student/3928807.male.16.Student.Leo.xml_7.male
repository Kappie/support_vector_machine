The interview went... okay. It could have been a lot better. Honestly I'll be a little surprised if I get hired. I busted the front wheel of my bike on the way there somehow, so that made riding home a pain in the ASS. Especially since I got caught in a STORM. I was drenched by the time I got home. I just took a shower.  Since it's raining, I can't go outside. Oh well, I'm tired anyways. Damn, it's been raining alot lately. Damn, why did A.J's dealer have to flee to Iran? What the fuck. If I don't get this Earl Bales job, it's back to motherfucking square one. Where am I going to look next? I'm tired of biking around, going store to store, asking if they are hiring. And I hate going downtown to the job fair. I tried to get drunk before I went to the interview, so I would be calmer. I drank a beer and a little whiskey. It didnt work. At all. Apparantly,I actually can keep my liquour. And at the interview I was nervous and a little unconfident.   So, what shall I do now? I can play Gamecube- nah. I can watch T.V - nah. I can watch a movie on my computer... nah. I can "surf the web".   ..damn, I'm just reflecting on the interview, and I realized I actually did horrible. It was a truly horrible interview. The only way I'm getting that job is if the other people who apply are even more incompetent than me. FUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!
