The so called denunciation of the PM's post by Sonia Gandhi is nothing more than a strategic decision keeping in her mind her ability and capability. I don't think even in my wildest possible dreams that she is a person capable of ruling India, leave aside the foreigner part of it. The mere fact that it took her about 15 years to become Indian speaks it all. How did she not know that she would be "elected" by the parliamentarians of the congress if it wins the election. This oversight might be coz She didn't expect that congress would win. Plain and simple. When NDA was able to project its candidate why was there no mention of Sonia not in fray if it is that Inner Voice was there b4 the elections, then why was she not declared "not in fray". Double Standards- Indian have been, are and will be easy prey for these people.
