Well it is now time to reflect on the year that was in Englihs. It wasnt bad, not as easy as i had hoped and my grades arent as good as they should be but i think i will do well on this paper. Thank god for debate team which will help me to do well on this kind of shit. Mrs. Martire wasnt that bad, too much writing at the end of the year. We should have gone a lttle quicker so not to rush the end of the year like this. All in all not a bad year and i wouldnt mind having her again but alas i wont because im a lazy bum wwho wont do yearbook because im going to have a full year already. Business law is too wasy and i hate the class if it was more interesting like a moke trial one week or something along those liens to get people excited about the class or at least not sleeping.  I also plan to update on my finals after i take them and by popular demand (meaning because im bored) I will update my profile with some sort of picture, and post a music list of everything i have playing in Winamp. Also i am planning on having a full summer here is a list that i may or may not have posted before: 1.  Read the required reading 2.  Do the projects really well 3.
