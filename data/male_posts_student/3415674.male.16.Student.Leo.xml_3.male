And you'll just drag me down below I know your something more But your not something for me And you never say What you see in me  SO JUST... LEAVE So I may fight this on my own SO JUST... LEAVE So I can have a chance to grow SO JUST... LEAVE ME HERE  It felt so good today Free and on my own So much that my outlook changed Even my voice had a higher tone Love is something that I will stay out of For as long as I possibly can Cause love is the weakness I can't stand
