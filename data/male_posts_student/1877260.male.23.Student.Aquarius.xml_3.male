Why an all-night wind rather than perhaps a hand from heaven? That would have been much more impressive.   The six days of Genesis and the wind at the sea ensure that the world will look natural.  A natural world allows us to maintain out free will.  The biblical Creator may be omnipotent, but in this universe each member of mankind chooses his or her own path. And sometimes we are given the opportunity to "persuade" even the Creator which path to choose.    Some time in the future a book review will come. Don't hold you breath tho, not responsibility taken if you suffocate.
