Since when was it a crime for an unmarried man to have a fling with an unmarried woman? Both Sven and Mark saw this woman at different periods of time (Which isn't a crime in Scotland, but obviously seems to be in England) and have admitted having a relationship with Faria Alam (Real name?). Faria Alam has also confirmed that she had a relationship with both men. Fine, no mis-understanings there then. But wait a minute, that's not right - A national football team manager having a relationship with an attractive woman - somebody call the News Of the World. Despite dwindling sales of this 'comedy' paper, they've obviously dished out big bucks on this farcical story to try and have a last ditch attempt to boost paper sales and give us all something to talk about for 10 minutes. So, after occupying the news for the last week and a half, wasting a whole load of people's time (Sven, the FA, the British public, infact everyone not working for the News of the World who I'll bet have now made quite a tidy sum from this little escapade) and an inquiry later it turns out that Eriksson is actually not guilty of anything at all (What exactly was was he accused of again?). Perhaps this is just the News of the World's little prank on the English football team after getting knocked out of Euro 2004 by Portugal on penalties, again. Comments, please.
