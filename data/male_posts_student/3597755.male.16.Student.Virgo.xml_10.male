With these three types of pieces I will never have a problem to supply more shit you will want to read.  What do I aim for? Being better than the best on the web. In a couple of months I will be funnier than Maddox (www.maddox.xmission.com). I will have more discussions going on than the best forum site, www.textravaganza.com . And you will have the possibility to discuss more about music than on any music blog or magazine forum.  Do you want to respond? Sure, go ahead. If you don't like my articles? Reply, I don't care. DO NOT BE SURPRISED IF I KICK YOUR ASS AFTERWARDS...   Toecrusher
