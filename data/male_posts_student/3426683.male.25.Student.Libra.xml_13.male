I order my meal, get a beer, sit down and watch.  I'm a little late, and the Dodgers have already scored a run, but only one, so it's okay.  Unfortunately, I can't listen to the play-by-play, because the WWE's  urlLink Bad Blood  pay-per-view is on almost every single TV with the volume jacked up, including the TV immediately to the right of the baseball game.  This is okay.  I can handle this.  I can block out the WWE and watch the ballgame.  I manage to ignore the  urlLink four-way bout for the women's world championship , despite the locals hooting and hollering around me (for some reason, I'm vaguely reminded of Braves OF Andruw Jones's  urlLink testimony  during the Gold Club trial and his reference to the strippers "doing lesbian action").  No worries.  I'm okay.  This is what I have to deal with to watch the ballgame.  Fine.  We'll just tune that out and pay attention to the ballgame.    By this point, I have an internal monologue doing play-by-play for the ballgame, trying to keep myself focused, but it's getting interrupted by the yahoo in front of me howling with laughter during the match between  urlLink Eugene and Jonathan Coachman .  By now, my monologue's sounding like this: "Okay, here's the one-one BODY SLAM!!!! that's a strike on the outside YAAAAAHAHAHAHAHA and a routine grounder to THE PEOPLE'S ELBOW!!!!..."  Also, by now, the NBA finals are getting going, and I've got to contend with Tom Tolbert's mug on the TV to the left of the ballgame.  I ended up right before the bottom of the fourth, which most of the people in B-Dubs would have considered to be right before  urlLink Kane and Chris Benoit  squared off.  I half expected someone to turn and ask me where I was going, as I was going to miss "the best part."  Anyhow, there's no punchline to this.  Just had to share my pain.
