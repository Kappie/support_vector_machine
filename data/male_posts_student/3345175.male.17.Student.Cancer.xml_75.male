You knew and…and you knew this wasn’t right. This wasn’t the plan! You bastard. You’re no better than a tease. But…you are better than that. Somehow…I cant explan…but I know you are. So why? Why now? Is it now? Are you…are you teasing now? You’re fucking me about again?  What kind of…This is by far the suckiest thing you have ever done to me, you know that? Tomorrow…I was supposed to….it was all I’d ever lived for, to…to die, tomorrow. It was going to be beautiful…my ultimate brilliance. My final moment, all I’d ever waited for.  To go down…fighting…fighting, and at my peak. And the good fight nonetheless. Not like this. Not like some…decrepit old man, in his sleep, in his…his fucking bed. After all this…you take it away from me? You do this to me? 	I was made to soar! You send all the signs, the opportunity, the battle…and…ARRRGH! The signs! THE FUCKING SIGNS! And yes, i…Why are you playing with me, with my mind? Payback? The years I didn’t pray to you, the way they told me? Having a little bit of originality…They told me to stop doing this…Stop fighting…It wasn’t your work…But it turns out I shouldn’t have? Is that really what you’re telling me? No, that doesn’t warrant this…you wouldn’t…you could, but…but I think you wouldn’t. Then again, could be lies. More lies. More deception. You convince me of so much so easily…so much promise…and then you snatch it back. Give and taketh away, is that what this is? Do I have more tricks to look forward to on this side? The need to fly, those power surges through my body, up my spine…I felt bleeding all over, my hands burned from the inside. And instead…I was dragged out of the fight, put on permanent reserve, just when it fucking mattered!...Grounded…Wingless, no wounds…no spark. Why bleed without a wound? Fly without the feathers? Burn without the flames…you extinguished me…right when you promised I’d light it up…when my fire would roar. I wasn’t your messenger, I know that. I wasn’t anybodies messenger. I wasn’t anything to anyone anymore…not anything…but I was a warrior…and I was going to tear the darkness…I was going to…and now I’m just, what? Gone? Faded? How do I judge when I’m in line for judgement? How do I end it, save others, when I have been ended, and when I cannot be saved? 	I was made to soar. And now I wont. Why be built for a task when there is none? Was I just a factory, making components for a fate that wouldn’t need them? Trust you…you bastard…And just when the fate needs me, I’m out of…out of production? It needs me. They need me. Can you see them? They can’t have me…they cant have me out of this…but they cant have me. Because you…pulled me out. I can’t sit this one out…I cant…I…they cant. They need one more, and I cant let them do this without me. I need to be what they need me to be. And dead is not it. I need to be the extra hand, I could make a difference, but you’ll have me stuck in this fucking place, my body lying there…cold…and I cant even feel it! I cant even feel the cold of lifeless fucking corpse! You would have me here…sitting and watching…when…when I could be cold…when I could be bleeding!…Burning... 	I was made to soar.
