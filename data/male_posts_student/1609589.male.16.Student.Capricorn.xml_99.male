It's the only web host I have and it wont let me post pictures! So here, goto  urlLink The Martin Luther King picture  so you can see it.  You know what that is? It's a picture of my Martin Loofer King ACTION figure! I took it with my digital camera. Isn't it awesome? It had a podium, but i lost it when i was 7. Hard to believe I kept up wif this thing all these years. Sorry there's crap in the background, directly behind him is me retainer case, under the power switch is a ticket stub for... ~looks at ticket stub~ The core...(thats been there a while), and behind it... some notes i drew on a note card while playing Myst(i'm such a dork), that blue thing is something that came with my Tarot Cards(which i want to start working with again...) and my kick-ass own-all computer(at least to normal people) to the right.  Well, I guess I'll go on a picture taking frenzy of wierd things i have... like.... my dart board i dont have any darts for, and my AOL CD collection.
