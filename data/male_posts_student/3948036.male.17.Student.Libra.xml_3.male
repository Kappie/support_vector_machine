But the thruth is, that before I cut my hair (very short), i had an afro(well people called me afroman so I guess it must've been true). And I had it all of last schoolyear too. So when I go to the BBQ tomorrow (*see one of the previous posts*) I expect people to be completely shocked! I hope it'll go something along the lines of: "Who the fuck is that-OMG, it's Karsten! WTF?!" And I'll just stand there and say: "Is there something wrong?" And they'll say: " OMG, man! You're all like haircutted and stufflike things!" And then I'll be all like: "So you noticed? I just took a little trim." And they'll be all like: " Wow, dawg. Yous be mad-trippin' right about now!" Nah, I'm just kidding. That was my imagination being carried away a little bit. But it should be fun though... If it's not, me and John is going to sneak off to see Spider-Man2. Which I hear is pretty good, so it's kind of a win-win situation.    My little borther is heading for Norway Cup soon. Ah, I can remeber when I was his age(actually I was one year younger if my memory isn't playing tricks on me) and went to NC...  The memories... Me scoring a goal, followed by me breaking my arm... Well at least we won the match! I hope my brother does better than me, well I know he's going to do better than me, because he is really more into this football stuff than I was. For example he is going to Idrettslinja next year, which is kind of like ordinary school just with more gym... Can't think of any equivalents to America nor Britain... SportSchool maybe?!    Right now it's very sunny outside, but a tad windy. So I think I'm going to go out for a sec.
