It's a 1991 Mazda 626 LX (or LE or something), manual transmission, champagne color. I can't find a picture online, leading me to think it's not a 1991 model. Either way, it's a nice car that drives well and has room. Now all I have to do is take my first test at the DMV Wednesday and get my Kansas permit, take Drivers Ed starting mid-August, and have my license in October. It's about damn time!
