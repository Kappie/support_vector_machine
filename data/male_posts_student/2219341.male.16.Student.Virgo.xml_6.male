God will make it ok.  thats where my comfort will always come from.  i've learned that the hard way.  twice.  ha!  i took me 2 times to get it.  but i did.  after all of that i realized that God is the only thing that will ever truely remain constant.  the ony one who will never turn their back on me.   and when the rest of the world does he will always be there with his hand streched out to help me.  that is one of the greatest feelings ever.  i still have to get used to it though.  its so hard not to depend on a person.  i still miss her.  even though i do feel better.  i guess thats ok.  i mean i do love her and i dont really want it to be this way...but i know its what God intends.  so why try and stop it.  i will survive.  i will be ok.  life will go on.  and God will guid me and give me the strength to keep breathing...no matter how cruel the world becomes...
