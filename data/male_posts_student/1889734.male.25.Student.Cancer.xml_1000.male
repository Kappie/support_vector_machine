I looked this up during lunch, and I thought it would be interesting.  First, check out  urlLink this  page titled "What the Department of Education does  NOT  do".   Under the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Nothing specific is said about education in the Constitution; therefore it falls outside federal authority.  In creating the Department of Education, Congress made clear its intention that the secretary of education and other Department officials be prohibited from exercising "any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system." The establishment of schools and colleges, the development of curricula, the setting of requirements for enrollment and graduation -- these are responsibilities handled by the various states and communities, as well as by public and private organizations of all kinds, not by the U.S. Department of Education.    Well, that's a relief.  At least they acknowledged the Tenth Amendment.  However,  urlLink here  is what they think they are allowed to do.   1. The Department of Education — establishes policies relating to federal financial aid for education, administers distribution of those funds, and monitors their use.  2. The Department of Education— collects data and oversees research on America's schools and disseminates this information to educators and the general public.  3. The Department of Education— identifies the major issues and problems in education and focuses national attention on them.  4. The Department of Education— enforces federal statutes prohibiting discrimination in programs and activities receiving federal funds and ensures equal access to education for every individual.   How do these activities differ from the prohibitions acknowledged in the Tenth Amendment?  They hand out money, collect data and 'focus attention'.  All for  urlLink $63 billion  per year.  $63 billion for an organization that really has no right to exist.  Why can't we abolish it?  What vital service does it provide that can't be done by the states, where it belongs?
