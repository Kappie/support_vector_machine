I am back from Canada and shall do my personal ranting after my reporting.    *RFID UPDATE* A company in the UK has begun research for the stated purpose of selling a system of meat tracking chips to the US. The chips run at a higher frequency than regulation chips in the US. Their plans look suspiciously like the plans of our good friend, the New York Senator who wanted to implement such a plan back in December and failed.    *Animal behavior update* earlier this month, July the fifth, over 200 melon head whales crowded into a harbor in Hawaii for two days. Two weeks earlier, 96 confirmed witness saw a cigar shaped object disappear over a set of mountains.  Another “manged fox” was seen in Baltimore, but the experts, though not retracting any statements have not yet deemed what it is. I have looked, but have not found a credible UFO sighting in the last 3 months near there.
