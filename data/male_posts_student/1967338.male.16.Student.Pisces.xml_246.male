I may check my e-mail on the twentieth but I may not so get JournalCon RSVPs  IN MY MAILBOX  by December 19th. E-mail is here. E-mail me even if you aren't coming so I'll know that you aren't coming, rather than just thinking that you are ignoring me, which I'm pretty sure most of you are.  TWoP Quote  "Oh, ABC! You and your viewer-discretion advisory. Trying so hard to be all rough and tumble. It's cute. Anyway. We open on a very rainy day, and two FBI agents chasing some other dude through an alley. It's very blue in Richmond, apparently. I'll add that to the list of things cinematography has taught me about geography: thanks to Line Of Fire, I know that Richmond is blue. Thanks to Traffic, I know that Mexico is yellow." Jessica on  Line of Fire
