Actually I have been quite busy and haven't really had the time to do such blogging.  So begin backblog of what I've been up to...  Last week on Thursday, I went up and visited Sam in the frozen tundra of Kalamazoo.  We went Ice Skating on Friday and Contra Dancing (look it up, its fucking nuts!) on Saturday with the girls from Sam's audiology program (who are all pretty damn cool from what I could make of em).  After the insane time with the simple folk (John Deer and Sally Plain-and-Tall, seriously the Amish seemed a bit more normal...) a few of us proceed to go to Monaco Bay (a kick ass piano bar that Sam has been kicked out of once before...) and get shit faced.  Thank you God for cabs.  We even met a really cool cabbie named Tom who I feel should become our new official chauffeur.  Its always a fun ride when you discuss the pronunciation of Ypsilanti and try to distinguish which is the best Deja Vu in the state...  Sweet...  Anyways, drove back early early Sunday to say goodbye to my dear sweet brother as he departs back to ISU.  Fucker... But he will be back as Friel will be playing another show this Friday (when and where, I have no clue, but whatever.)  So nothing fun happened Monday except for re-injuring the bone spur on my right fifth metatarsal from where I probably broke it once before, but never healed properly.  It happens.    Today was another story.  First day of clinical and I am already so depressed I wanna shoot myself.  Really.  Our unit?  The people out of the hospital (acute care)?  Nope.  The private residents?  Nope?  The Alzhiemers?  Nope.  Well, not really.  Yes, they have what Reagan have, but in the final forms.  Advanced Alzhiemers...  Few talk, they scream, talk gibberish, don't respond, defecate on themselves, many are combative (that means they like to hit you), and its the worst possible thing ever compared to atypical Parkinson's (that my Grandma has).  Would you rather have a clear functioning mind and be trapped in your body as it goes to shit or lose your mind and not even know that you are losing your body along with it?  Seriously.  If I ever get this way, Im going to have a talk with two gentlemen: Smith and Wesson.  Seeing how these people live, I couldn't or wouldn't want to live like that.  Im sure these poor people don't want to, either.  So where do I come in?  Im here to help make sure that the final moments of their lives are as calm and pleasant as possible so they can die with their dignity.  Although Im sure they don't remember any of what I am doing for them...  But if I can just get one glimpse of the real person trapped inside their mind, then I think this will all be worth it.
