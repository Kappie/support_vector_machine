I didn't know the news the whole of Yesterday . I thought the CAT paper this year was a bit easy than the one I had given earlier and I was also surprised when they asked us to take the question paper back with us .                               Now the CAT is likely to be rescheduled in the month of Jan according to newspapers , but this is a Big shock for most of the aspirants who have other exams  schedules planned .
