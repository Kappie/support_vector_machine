That wasn't that bad; we had one debate all year, I did participate in that one and we got knocked out in the first round even though we should have one. I got a fairly decent score, I'm not sure what it was right now but like a 22 or something one round and like 27 the next. A lot of talk and next year should be promising with my new links and stuff updated, I hope if I have time think summer. Not a bad year hopefully we will go to some more debates next year and possibly host one my senior year which would be awesome! ARC was ARC, we almost killed little Fonda and Rachel with our rocket and started a fire. Next year one engine per stage for us. Actually I don't feel like writing right now I don't know why I feel as if I should be working or something. Well everything after this point is what I am editing at 8:03 pm Saturday June 26th. Well Track, specifically indoor and outdoor track. Indoor wasn't bad thisyear, I didn't do as much running as I usually do which is a plus and I did get better in shot put which is good but I still haven't broken 30 feet which is really buggin me a lot! Had a lot of fun with the seniors and will have fun with those returning, but I don't think some people should be allowed to do track jsut because they don't take it seriously. This was the first time I met Rachel who I have had a crush on for a little while. But next year she will be going away to Savanah College of Art and Design and I will be stuck at Bunnell for two more years. But hey maybe I will try my luck luck with Carlie who I also met in indoor track. Next year she will be a senior and do I honestly think I stand a chance to go out with a senior. She would rather go out with Austin or a friend to prom or ring dance over me a dumb rash prude junior. But that is enough wallowing in self pity because I hear that Lindsay and Teddy split up which is an interesting development. I seriously doubt she would have any interest in me because she could get any guy she wants in our grade probably, and she definately could get any of my friends if she wanted to. But maybe I do stand a chance because she did talk about me once or twice to Julie, so thats a plus, but hey how will I ever know if i don't try or have someone try. Outdoor track was good because i got varsity for Javalin and I will get better bcause I plan to lift and shit. Also I broke what I wanted to for disk, which was 90 and i got 91 and change. In shot I quite because that i no longer my forte but Javalin and hammer. Also i set the school record in hammer but had it broken by Marcin 3 times in a row. If I only threw what I normally throw I could have been in the finals and possibly gotten all state or something. By the time I am a senior I will have my name on one of those Banners!
