Anyone who has seen it, see it again. Anyone who has seen it many times, good work, you may rest at ease!   To educate you : It stars Jack Black and Mike White. Black plays a failed rocker who takes the identity of his flatmate Mr Schneabley a substitute teacher and proceeds to train up his prep-school class to be in a rock band to play at theBattle of the Bands.   Throughout the film are classic gags and brilliant comedy from Jack Black, including his ad-libbed songs and wacky facial expressions. The characters are believable; White's girlfriend is incredibly annoying and the headmistress Mrs Mullins is typical youthfull rocker made bitch through stress and the cast of children that make up the band and crew are cool and watching their transformation at the hands of the wild Dewy Finn (Black) is quite impressive.   Overall, a must-see film. Great for the familly as much as the "hardcore" musicians.   On another note... Spyk Thomas' Blog is now up and running, since I prodded him senseless to make one, at  urlLink http://spykshit.blogger.com . Check it out, it promises to be more random and even less structured than my own.        Gonna end this here, been writing this far too long... Will probably edit this when I have little or nothing to do.        Dxx
