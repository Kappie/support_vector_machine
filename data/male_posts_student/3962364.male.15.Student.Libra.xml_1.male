Yes, its back to Orlando in two days. UCF soccer camp. But your not reading my blog to read about UCF...its about what happened at Camp Orlando. And by George..I shall tell!  Day-1: Arriving with kaos  With a long drive..and a ..I guess you can say excited...to and eventfull first day. We arrived at the Sheraton and go through the doors and look at the Great Big Lobby. Dont get to excited. Wait till you hear about the rooms! You'll be like..O thats awesome! But anyways. We hear loud music. Jarrod thought it was a club. But we walk through the doors to a big room and loud music. Yearbookers dancing! Who would of thought that yearbook peeps have a wild side? Well Camp Orlando was full of some yearbook hotties! No complaints watching them dance. So with a little bit of dancing, and some rules from the "instructors" we began our classes.  Class- Meet Mrs. Border  Well well well...we have a mixture of spunky and yet...prefectionus (is that a word? get back to me) and a little bit of (some of us think) A.D.D . So class begins. We learned loads..about I lines...fonts...and other stuff. But it gets a little bit boring..and you sometimes need a snooze. NOT like I did that or anything but, thought crossed my mind. So we finish our first lesson. And to top off a boring lesson..HOMEWORK! ugh. But I did finish it. So its all good.   Hotel Room-  Remember what I told you. How you would be like awesome about our hotel room? The famous 1,702 room Shearton. Yes. We stayed at that. But..the downside..we stayed at the 2 story Sheraton. Its next to the big tower. So we walk in to a ordinary hotel room. Two Beds...t.v..refridgerator...basics. But. The door shuts..with difficulty. Bathroom door shuts, not lock, but shuts...with difficulty. But. It will be our home for the next 3 nights. Might as well make it for the best....right? Well obviously I made it through, or else I would not be spilling what happened at camp. So. I have five roomates. Three older staffers, and Jarrod and myself. Jarrod being wild decides to start jumping on the beds. Yes yes, laughs there. But anyway, its our home and thats what matters. After another class, we come back to our "home" and start to chill for the night. With a little bit of laughing and being fat the night ened to Anger Managment and some conversation, we concluded our first night at camp.  Day-2: A beautiful way to start...  Wow...day two..alright. Only 2 more days at camp which really means...damn. I start class and relize that someone other than my fellow TRHS staff members have noticed me. At least, I think I did. Cara was watching and told me about a girl that sits next door at the next table. And she apparently keeps looking at me. First thought is is there something wrong with my feature. Anything in the teeth...on my shirt. But both were a negative. She deffinitly was looking at me.  Well...shes a good looking girl deffintly. So later in class we begin to talk. She is so cool to tlak to, she seemed so chilled. We talked and then I got back to work. I had met a new friend though. And it was pretty cool. Glad I met that girl.  Day-2: THRS and the quest for the holy hat  To make camp more interesting...schools have a chance to do a skit. Schools were supposed to bring a funky hat and do a skit about how that hat defines us. Well, we had to make our hat. And stayed up late making the skit for it. So we decide to make our own version using Monty Python and the quest for the holy grail. Well it was a good one. Im going to try and upload the video onto my blog soon as david can help me and tell me how. Look out for it coming to you my readers.  Day-2: Universal  Lateron day two, we get to go out for a little bit of fun. We decided to go to Universal. Most people went to Islands of Adventure, but I do not like roller coasters, so David and Lauren both wanted to go to Universal Studios. No complaints. I went with them. My first time there. We got there and rode The Revenge of the Mummy first. Dang! Thats how you start off a good time. If you havent taken a ride on that..I must say you should. Then ET, Back to the future...MIB2...and other ones. It was a good time.  Day-3: Workshop heats up  Whew..after a fun night, we get back and start to work on layouts. We had to do them on paper!! Im used to doing them on the computer, but paper. So of course. No one from THRS could make a perfect one for Mrs. Perfect herself. So after three pages, I finally have a decent one for the likings of her. We also worked on captioning today. To easy. But that was one easy thing turned into difficulty for me. We get back to the room where Jarrod and Jon both make themselves jump from one bed to another, " FLYING FISH" crazy time. I believe the work was getting to us.  - Later that night was the workout night. Jarrod, David and I go first to the fitness room. Being a soccer player and missing practices..you need to run. So we workied out. Soon Jon, Courtney and Melissa joined us for the fun. We ran somemore and lifted some weights. Well we wanted to go for a swim to cool down, but it was closed. So we needed something to do. Melissa and I went for some ice cream and we went back to the room to watch t.v. Next thing we know there is a security guy at the door. He comes in and says "Im taking care of the room problem..." and tells us to turn the t.v down. Cara is on the phone and he tells her to put it on mute...so she puts it against her chest. But then the room phone goes off and its Lauren wanting to talk to Adam. Overall, we were supposely getting complaints about us, and he came to talk to us. It was the damn Irish people next door. They complained several times supposely. So we made sure we made no noise whats so ever ;)on our last night at the best hotel in the world.    Day-4: Last pages...last of classes  What a bummer, I get to leave Mrs. Borders class..what will I do? Well, first I will not listen to her, and then ill wont do anything! yay! All I did was write letters. Then we went to lil classes and finally met our pro. She talked to us about last years yearbook. Her likes her dislikes, her ideas. Overall she liked our cover and yearbook. So, we checked out, said our last goodbyes to ppl and were on the road to lunch. TGIF. Had some chicken tenders and some final laughs. The ride home was sad. I didnt want this trip to be over..even though all that happened. But we got back to the river and that is where im left now. In two days I leave for UCF soccer. And I can hardly wait to start the laundry for that. Well, I have given you a good five minutes of reading time. Im out for now. Till then readers. Peace.
