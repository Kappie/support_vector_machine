Here's a conversation I overheard while in the bathroom between speakers:  1: "Hey, whaddya think so far?"  2: "Oh man, are you kidding? I live for this stuff!"  1: "Ha ha! I hear ya. That guy was right on about prioritizing.   2: "You know it. You know, every morning I enter my tasks in my tablet..."  [this is where I started rolling my eyes]  2: "...and then I put them in order of importance. And I've found that when I accomplish the first three or four, the rest just seem to melt away."  1: "So true. Are you staying for the lunch roundtable session? I'm going to be here the whole day."  2: "You know it!"  I didn't know these people existed. More on this later.
