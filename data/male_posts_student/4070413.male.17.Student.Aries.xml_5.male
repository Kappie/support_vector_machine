Used to escape from this song n deny that u were once my past. But all of the sudden, its doesn't bothers me anymore. So i assume that i don't love u. To look at u once again, i felt that u r unfamiliar. Taking another closer look, i can't recognise u anymore. Are u ther one i deeply love before? I think the defensive wall within my heart had recover from the past hurting wounds. Probably time really heals all wounds. Just finish writing. I fallen asleep
