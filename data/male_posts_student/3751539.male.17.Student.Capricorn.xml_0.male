Then I gained experience and it became natural, but there is still a strange, subtle experience underneath it, a strange feeling.  It is like visiting a far away land where you don't fully understand everything that is going around you.  Every so often this feeling develops into one of almost panic as I try and figure out whether or not the directions I got were good ones, or if I just missed the exit.  When you are on the highway, one hour away from home, without a cellphone, you really are alone.  You don't have family or friends to support you or double check you.  I can handle almost everything that is thrown at me, but it is wierd having so few safety nets. My guess is that my driving experience will change as I learn more, and also that the strange, lack of safety net feeling will occur more often as I go to college and start living on my own.
