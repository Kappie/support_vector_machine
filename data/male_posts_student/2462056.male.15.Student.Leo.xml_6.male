(haha)  Countdown until Jesse and Trevor get home from Woodward:  6 Days  countdown Until Claire and Dabney get home from North Carolina:  6 Days  Yeah.... 6 days.... thats a while!  I havne't updated this thing in like, 2 days... hmmm, what has gone on in those two days...  On Sunday I went and played soccer with a bunch of people for about 2 hours, then went home and ate dinner, then that night I went over to Claire's house, along with Ben and Andy, and we watched TV, ate pizza, played Uno Attack and Apples to Apples, then we just kinda hung out until we left!  Thats pretty much all I did on Sunday, cuz I got back from Claire's around midnight.  Then on Monday... I didn't really do anything cuz I had to stay home and watch my sister.  Then that night, around like, 9:30 or so, Claire came over and me and Claire and Lacy played Uno Attack and Candyland!  It was mucho fun.  Then when we were done with that we all sat around and talked until around 11:30 when Claire's mom came and picked her up!  She left for North Carolina today and she won't be back until Monday, which sucks, because that is a pretty long time!  Today... I did nothing at all, just kinda sat around and played Half-life, which I beat! Then I went straight into Half-Life: opposing Force, cuz i'm a total dork, hahaha.  My sister has 2 of her friends over for a "sleep-over," so they better not get loud tonight or I'll have to whoop some little kid ass tomorrow! Haha not really, cuz I'll probably be up way later than they are.
