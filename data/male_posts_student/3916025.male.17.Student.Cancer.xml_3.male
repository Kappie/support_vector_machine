I told Bobby to meet me at Cyprus so we could hang out. So he took me to lunch at Wendys, then we went to his house because he wanted to show me his house. It's a pretty nice house. Then he showed me his  HUGE  backyard. Very nice. Then it was time for me to go home. So he dropped me off and then later that day (or night I guess) I went to see:  Fall Out Boy ,  Bayside ,  Armor For Sleep  and  Name Taken  at the  Venue . It was so awesome!!! I love every minute of it!  I get ungrounded in one week from today! How exciting is that?  VERY ! Well, my uncle from New Mexico might be coming on Wednesday so that will make the week go by faster. Ummmmmmmm......on  Friday the 13th  there is a show at the Zipcode (in Magna) and Chris Suitt's band ( Apollo Collage ) is going to be playing!   Friday the 13th .....what a day. 7 months ago me and Tim went on a group date. On  Friday the 13th . That's crazy that 7 months have passed. Well I guess this is it.
