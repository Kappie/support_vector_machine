Completed quake...GLQuake  really does improve the graphics of quake...nice 3-D acceleration,  quake looks so much better with it, particularly the blood and  explosions. Nothing like a good shooting spree on violent  games...alongside my Huntign on Carnivores...managed to bag T-Rex with  the Shotgun, X-Bow And the sniper rifle (i really hate the  rifle...makes things way too easy)   And...Discworld...I love playing Discworld, and managed to get Discworld Noir working...bit of a laugh..hehe  And  of course, I want to get Myst to work on windows XP...I havn't seen if  it will run, and I am hopeing I won't have to find any patches in order  to play it.   Well...next week, I leave...I intend to sort out a  notebook or something to keep a journal which i can post here. As for  now, well...Nothing more...yet.
