The second worst president of the United States ever (oh, and the worst is in office right now), who was the guy who started the whole "Starwars" national (needless) missile defense system. Mr. Ray-Guns coined "trickle-down economics", the worst economic policy/theory ever put in place, oh-and its still in use under "monkeyass's" rule (America is a monarchy, right??). Mr. Dutch also loosened restrictions on America's auto industry, so you can blame HIM whenever you see a fat-ass hummer on the road today. Reagan's policies were crap, and Bush lives the legacy.  Oh, and about this week-long marathon burial: Clinton won't get one that long, will he now? Most likely not, since he "caused" the large national debt (which is actually the "monkey's" doing).  Needless to say, Reagan didn't deserve the attention he got for saying what people wanted to hear and doing otherwise (that means he made false promises, everyone), and Bush sucks even worse.
