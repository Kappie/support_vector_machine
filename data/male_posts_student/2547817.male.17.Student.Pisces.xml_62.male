As to the Zel issue, I figure, "good things come to those who wait". It hurts when I think of the fun we had. It's not my fault. Just read an email that Jiu Rong sent me. "Everything a guy should do for a girl" I read it and got everything checked on the list. I did it all for her. Even the lying down under the stars with her head on my chest. Everything. I miss her so much.   Oh shit, I'm crying.  Went to see runaway jury today with Shawn Goh( Bukit Batok sec sch ex head prefect NJC) and Audrey Chua (RJC). No special effects or high speed car chases, but a damn good thinker.  Here's a special thanks to Jiu Rong for making me smile whenever we meet wherever we meet. She's pretty and wise. Today she told me that I shouldn't hold on to a beautiful memory so tightly till it hurts. How true.
