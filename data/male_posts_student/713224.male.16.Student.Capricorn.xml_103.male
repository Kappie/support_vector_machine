As soon as i looked at the box, i also noticed a familiar baldy (no, not ellen degenerise), it was big Vinny D. Now I'm not a huge fan of VD, in fact, my philosophy with his movies is similar to that of movie games ever since -xXx- was released, But since i couldn't get a ride to the local prison, i had no choice but to play it.      This isn't youre average movie game. V Dizzle's voice acringg is just as good as his acting, monotonous and balls to the wall, add his confused and angry stare, and he could tell you wearing womens underwear is hardcore and badass. But this becomes boring when you feel terrified to walk by an item when the Vinmeister barks "Press 'X' to pick up this weapon". You half expect him to take a cheap shot at your mother or make a comment striking my man hood down to that of a 9 year old girl. Now all this slander of a accomplished *cough*failiure*cough* actor (i dont care HOW bad ass he was in Pitch Black) may make you think this game sucks, which it definately doesn't. Actually, now that I think about it, it really isn't that great. For starters the graphics are really good... sort of. The anti-aliasing is terrible, and so are the textures. the animations are averageg though, and the models and attention to level design are superb. Another aspect i like about the visuals in this game is relatively no hud. The guns dont have crosshair and the ammo is displayed digitally on the gun. The only display is the health bars, which are very hard to read and they're ulgly too. Obviously the plot is decent because its a MOVIE, and the game play is alright, but it has NO replay value (which is not something youde want in a 10 hour game).      All in all, my rating is a 5, but if you dont hate Big D, then its 8.5-9.     nice goggles... jackass.
