And I had this thought.  All these straight men mimicking queer style.  If I were a cultural critic in training, I'd point out that in saying we like the way these gay men dress, we are saying that there is something we find attractive about these gay men.  We like the way they look.  We identify with them enough to mimic their style.  The show is a very clever way of teasing out the latent homoerotic tendencies of the straight man.
