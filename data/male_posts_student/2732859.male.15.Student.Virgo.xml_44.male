He didn't get much of a bounce probably because there was nothing to bounce to.  Only about 10% if that of the voting population are undecided, and those people probably won't vote in the end anyway.   urlLink http://http://www.slate.com/id/2104745/  Go here to see a credible person talking about how the polls are good for Kerry.  I would bet that Kerry will win and will probably win by a fairly large margin, maybe 5%.  That is a lot for this election.  Most of the undecideds will go for the challenger, Kerry.  Kerry victory in November.
