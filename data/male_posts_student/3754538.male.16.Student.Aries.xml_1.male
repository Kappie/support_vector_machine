Looking at the listed height, the label clearly stated a max height of 6 inches. The plant was already at least 2 and 1/2 feet tall.   A bush with all white flowers. The label glorified the "vibrant pink, yellow, or red flowers."  Can't remember any others right now but there were some more.   You'd think such an established company could at least get the labels (that they print themselves) straight.
