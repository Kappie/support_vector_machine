Onto more important matters.  The latest PPV. I hear it was quite a smash! Maybe its just me but I think that Smackdown has not only better story lines (well...they are more practicle at times) but they also have better wrestlers by far. No doubt. Absolutely...you have Angle, Lesnar, Big Slow, Haas and Benjamin, Cena, Hardy, Los Guerreros, Taker, Edge (although he is nursing a neck injury), Ultimo Dragon (where is he by the way...). Need I rant on more?  Smackdown far superior in the talent department!!!
