I was doing my AP Euro and all the sudden I end up in my bed. I don't even remember how I got there. I slept for about 2 hours and when I woke up I felt like I came home from school at 8 at night. Dinner had been long ready, and now I can't drum because it's too late. I can't even type right now. This is so weird. What happened!!! It's confusing, today was a complete blur and allI remember was the fire truck and Mr. Michaelis coming to my neighbor's house. Now I'm acting all crazy. Everything's green! GREEN EVERYWHERE! AHHHH!! MUCUS!!! Where's tomorrow when you need it? Come on tomorrow, come to me and overthrow this weirded out day of mine!
