At any rate, you live- Douglas Adams   Flash of the Day : http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/french.php   Rambles : I’m amazed at the number of people who try and make arguments without backings. Had an argument with somebody yesterday about God, she was saying she hated him etc. When I asked why, she had no reason, but she did make a lot of comments on religion. I conclude from this she hated religion, and because God is the core focal point in religion, she hated him. Stupid…   You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty - Mahatma Gandhi  I often forget that.   Well, sometimes I wonder how virtuous I am. I don’t belong to any religion, so I take it upon myself to judge how loyal I am to God. Sometimes I feel I’m not very loyal, because I question what happens to me, and why it has to happen to me, despite knowing that you have to take the good and the bad. Sometimes I feel that I am, because I seem to be surrounded by people who pray to religion rather than pray to God, which is awfully fucked up. These people have attitudes that follow the “Oh, I go to church, so it’s alright for whatever the fuck I do the rest of the time”, and these are people that have criticised me for not choosing a religion. It pisses the righteous fuck out of me.   I can’t write much more, I’ve been sapped of energy since yesterday. Well, i'd like to state that CB idol was alright, I enjoyed seeing the teachers perform. Only in CB do economic teachers rap, and do computer technicians break dance xD On this note, I end with a congrats to Christina for winning xD
