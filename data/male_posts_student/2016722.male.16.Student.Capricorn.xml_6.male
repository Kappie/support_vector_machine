Also, I need to find a new violin teacher. Alice suggested switching about 6 months ago because she thought it was time. She's good, but too nice. And I know her more like a good friend, which can be good, but it just deteriorates the lessons. Some choices are... David Brickman, maybe Katha's teacher, Boris, and Alice has some Russian lady at her school who she wants me to try. She does seem good, but is new to teaching, and Alice probably just wants me to stay at Kanack. Besides that, I have German homework due tomorrow. Ansel and the German teacher are coming here at 7:30. That's early. For me. Tomorrow we have auditions for concertos at the notoriously bad Eastman Fellowship Ensemble. I think that's what its called. Even the name is notoriously bad. I'm playing Hindemith Trauermusik (Music of Mourning). Its really beautiful but modern, so the judges, whoever they may be, won't like it as much as say... Addison's Bach or whatever noise he is blasting out now. Bach isn't noise, Addison is. Just clarifying. Anyway, German.
