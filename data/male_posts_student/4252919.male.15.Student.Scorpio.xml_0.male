My mom and I drove half way around Cleveland to pick up a copy of my Birth Certificate, and Social Security Card(no, you may not have the number). Both of these required for a job(why need a copy of my birth certificate, obviously I've been born, and I am still alive...*shrugs* and so ended that day.  Eventually, during the natural sleep process, the sun slowly rises as the moon sets. Now unfortunate for me, things didnt work this way. I went to sleep at 11 on Friday, woke up at 1am on Saturday, and didnt get back to sleep till 6. Early morning television bites. Now eventually I went back to sleep *for an hour and a half* woke up, got ready, and waited for my cousin to come pick me up. When he did, we went to help his girlfriend move back into college. So we drove, out into the middle of almost nowhere(only because there were gas stations that weren't by highways or freeways). So after taking stuff out of her car into the apt, we then had to get her stuff out of storage. When we arrived, we found rat pellets over boxes and containers(nothing like surprises to make a day go better) and we took that back to her apt too, then headed home. Tiring? You bet it was.  (This is where that noise would sound, you know the one from Law and Order when there's a change in scene, or when it first begins. I'd write out the noise, but I don't exactly know how to do that. So from now on, I'll just put L short for Law and Order Noise. So lets give this a try. )  *L* And so sunday rolls around, and what do I choose to do? I play eda video game for about 2 hours straight(very disappointed when i found the special ending...PICTURES...5 of them...they did have two sizes though...small and magnified...boy oh boy how happy I was...anyway back to the point) followed by getting ready for dinner at grandmother's(now this is no sarcasm...very(emphasis on very)very good food(notice the parenthesis within the parenthis)) and so I gorged myself(with children...wouldn't you like to know) and went to filling out paperwork.  That's right, I now what it's like to first become aware that you have been accepted to be an employee. You get to fill out tons of paperwork(I dunno, maybe that's part of paying your dues or something??? I should investigate that...or somethin) but its worth it sense I'll finally have a job.  Otherwise than that, and the fact that I'm writing this blog, I don't think there's too much more to say.  Oh and yes, the title of this blog has nothing to do with the content itself. Just some random stuff making fun of the quote from the matrix where the little boy goes "There is no spoon." That was kind of funny, because when he said that, I could have swore that I was looking at a spoon on the tv, and not only that, but the coding of the matrix would have shown that there was a spoon, so in conclusion, one must agree that even though the spoon didn't exist in true reality outside of Neo's mind, the spoon inside his mind, of the matrix, did indeed, exist(it's smart-#$!es(I'm not sure if I'm allowed to swear or not on these things...(and another parenthesis within a parenthesis(so that makes 3(and 4 if you include this one)))but anyway its smart-#$! such as myself that make really good movies like the Matrix get bad ratings).  This concludes our feature presentation.
