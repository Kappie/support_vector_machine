I wanna go to a huge protest in LA, but i dont know if I can. I might see a movie tonight. depdnds on how much homework i ahve. im getting used to staying up later. every morning I wake up at like 6 and then drift in and out. its much better than just being forcced to get up immediately. and im sleeping later.  hum  jen couldnt cut me today. she had to talk to mr. mclaughlin about a late lab. next time she has to cut me above the elbow. so no one can see. spain in one week!  hum.  life is tiring. at lunch i helped jen with some stuff. sat with her and andrea for a while. then this annoying boy came. so many annoying people today. him, sheva, um...im sure i had more before..oh well.  hum  OH yeah!! a huge truck filled with gas fell over on the freeway and killed some poeple, gas everywhere, im sure explosions. mass traffic jams. everyone was diverted off the freeways to small side roads. thousand sof people. i wa slucky cause i knew the areas around and the secret roads, but people like neena were 3 hours late. she drove in a carpool from 6 45 to 10 45. My God.   talking to adrienne..she gave up this morning and just went home..nice.  i should go....im alone with ms allen..scary..lol  much love  peace  ~alex
