Started off... Interestingly. The band butchered up an Oscar winning score. Well..., Actually, "The Two Towers"'s score didn't win an Oscar. But no worries. It was alright though, but I'm such a fanboy that anything Howard Shore writes is music to my hea-ears. God I need to get out more. Anyway, after that was an amusing video/film. It was kinda funny... The cameo appearance made by my Grade 10 English teacher was hilarious... After that everything was just old and "seen it". The films that the kids at school have made so far are all shit. I'm sorry, but I could write something better in an hour. Well after this came the all important dances. Not. My high school seems to celebrate everything with a dance. We've had a few deaths since I started in 2001, and yes, we had a dance for at least one of them. That is how sad we are. Well after the five-hundred dances the was a foolish kid who decided to make an ass out himself and rap. It was... funny. But fell  so  flat. I could have pulled a better assembly out of my ass. Go figure. Final rating: Six out of Ten.  Now for my weekend plans. ISUs galore! And studying. I'm a bit worried about one ISU (which isn't really an ISU since it stands for Independent Study Unit and this is in groups...) 'cause we have to get together tomorrow, which means I'm the ring leader... Great. I'll get 'em all sorted though! And it'll be GREAT! Rock on y'all!  And that's it for today... Stay cool.
