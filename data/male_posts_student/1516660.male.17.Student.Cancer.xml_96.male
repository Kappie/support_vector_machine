I basically told X why......I don't know whether he gets the idea across or not. Who cares?! Right?  I just realized, that this is the first time, I cried because of a broken frienship. Yes.....probably because this is one of the most treasured friendships I had. And silly old me was crying while singing Sarah Brightman. Can you imagine it? Crying and singing at the same time? I am a siao cat.   I am glad this whole thing turned out very well. Can you imagine? 5 days of not talking to X? Sounds pretty torturous if you ask me. Ahhh.....I can get a good night's sleep le. A good good good night sleep. Goodnight.
