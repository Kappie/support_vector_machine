So many things my mom doesn't let me do. I miss him. Wish he hadn't gone. Said he'd call me back later on tonight but I doubt it. He might forget like usual or I'd miss his call from being at guitar class.   Should I type out what's wrong on here?... I'm tempted but I'll probably only type out the minor things. The major stuff I'll leave for myself. Where should I start? Hmm...  Well first of all, I think, or should I say KNOW, that Nika likes Nima. I think she still likes him a lot. When I say a lot, I mean A LOT! Anyway... so let's go back in time a bit... according to my resources, Nima and Nika went out last year, I think. Someone said that they broke up after one week of being together. People say that Nima said he didn't really like Nika but only went out with her because she liked him A LOT. Then Nima put "I LOVE _ _ _ _" in his nickname on MSN and Nika thought it was supposed to be her name so she liked him again. She also wrote "N" on her desk once and someone asked why "N" and she said something about "N" being the person she liked. Another thing is that she stares at Nima in class. Any class. In Science, she stares at him non-stop. It's kinda scary. I don't know if anybody else noticed [Kryss and Moca knows] but Nika ALWAYS ends up close to Nima. She's always behind, beside, or in front of Nima. "Coincidence? Fat chance."   A third thing is that I think Konez tried to stop Nima and I getting together for her friend Nika. Why else would she have made up all that crap about Nima and piss me off? Probably because her friend likes him and wants to help her friend out? Interesting...  A [wise person] had  this  opinion on this situation, or rather our relationship... (WP = Wise Person, and I'll say "it" instead of "him" or "her")  WP thinks that Nima is with me because he likes the attention I give him and that he's too nice to admit it. Maybe he's going out with me because I liked him a lot? Another bizarre possibility. WP thinks he's only acting and it observed that his attitude towards Moca and I are the SAME.   I don't know... I thought about WP's opinion a lot and it really made me think. I came to accept that it IS a possibility but after washing my hair and taking a nice, warm, comforting shower, I changed my mind. I am going to disregard that possibility because  I trust Nima.  I trust him when he tells me he loves me. I trust him when he says he cares. Therefore, that is over with and is merely WP's opinion. I should not have done something so foolish as to even take it into consideration. [No offense to ____]To be EXTREMELY honest TO THE MAX, I cannot help but agree to the statement regarding his attitude towards us.   I am either paranoid or I am losing it completely. [S-Gurl] might get POed and just get annoyed with me but you know what? I'm really tired of this. I'm tired of her getting annoyed at me for the things I do. She is a great friend but you know what? I can't stand it sometimes. I'm ME. I'm PARANOID, A BRAT, BITCHY, AND EVERYTHING YOU SAY I AM. Okay?! Accept me for me. Otherwise, please do not PO everytime I do something that annoys you. So many things YOU do annoy me and piss me off but I don't ever blow up at you OR snap at you! Give me a freakin break! Okay, let's get back on topic.  Am I being too blunt? Being too honest? Being too paranoid? Care too much? Or do I love him too much? I don't know... you tell me what I am. But after reading this, I am 100% SURE that Nima agrees I am anyting BUT perfect. Sorry Nima... you wanted me to be honest. Here I am. I could never get myself to say all this to you... therefore, that is why you're reading my blog.  Also, I just remembered... Nika was beside Nima during art class too. He was sitting with Nikki, Nika, Konica, Kellie, Alena, Mayhar, and all those people. Most of them were "Persian". *rolls eyes* I am so freakin sick of this "PERSIAN PRIDE WORLD WIDE" thing. Next time Nikki does that, I'm probably gonna start spazzing at her. I admit I used to say "AZN PRIDE" but I don't do that anymore. I knew it was racist. Okay, back to the Nika thing. So yeah... I don't like how Nika is always beside Nima or whatever. In fact, it bugs me... am I jealous? Probably. But you know what? I'm past the point where I'm hiding my jealousy. If and when I'm jealous, I post it all on here. Good idea? Definitely.   After letting this all out on my blog, I feel a lot better and also a lot worse. I feel like a totally jealous and paranoid bitch bitchy brat. I really do. Fuck it... I shouldn't have said anything anyway. 5:30... one more hour until guitar lessons. Won't be back until 8:00pm. Borrrring. Well, I'm off for now. This is probably the longest blog I've typed up. Too bad Nima's on his "walk", otherwise, I'd call him and tell him to read this. Well, I'll blog later. Gonna exercise a bit.  Nima, after reading all that up there, I want you to know that I'm sorry. You have no idea how sorry I am. Also know that I love you, and it's true. Otherwise, I wouldn't be so paranoid, jealous, and I wouldn't care so freakin much. I hope you understand. Asheghetam. I mean it. Please... don't ever forget. No matter what happens.
