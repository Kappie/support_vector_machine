This is very cool.   After that Pisal and I went to have dinner at the BBQ plaza and went to his house to burn some cd  and play NBA live 2004. We were having 4 consecutive loss :( . And cheering Soccer EURO 2004. our favorite team for the match LATVIA and they were loss...!!  I drag my sleepy soul home.
