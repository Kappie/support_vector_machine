Academia has its good and its bad sides. I am sailing on the positive gradient... this is nice....  I do appologise to my gril-friend she does understand my passion. She would just prefer that the pasion was like that for her too. It will be...  On the mean time take care.... I will post all the incidents that happen. And also some recipies of course. I will feel like cooking again pretty soon.  Mood: brilliant....
