Saturday went to the mall and in one fell swoop got caught up with my X-Men comics.....yeah I'm a big effing kid...I bought three "trade paperbacks" basically collected story arcs....I also bought Harlem Nights on DVD....guilty pleasure....  Sunday I rested....then went back to the mall....got a Milwaukee Brewers jersey and a t-shirt....and three more movies....Rounders, The Game, and Star Wars Episode 1.....I figured I couldn't go into Attack of the Clones (which has to be ten times better by default) without giving the Phantom Menace one more shot....this brings my DVD total over 120 which should be illegal....  Just got done watching the 20 most contraversial (sp?....who cares!) videos according to MTV....of course there was no Public Enemy or NWA....but they did manage to surprise me with a 2 Live Crew clip....the choice for number one (*****SPOILER ALERT*****Prodigy....Smack my Bitch Up....your bad for missing it) was new to me....I never caught it in the week that they showed it....it DID live up to the hype though....I caught the surprise ending before it caught me....I saw it coming a mile away but it was still something interesting....  Back to the grind tomorrow....it's the anchor leg of the relay....the homestretch....gotta call in my reserves....can I make it?.....we'll see!
