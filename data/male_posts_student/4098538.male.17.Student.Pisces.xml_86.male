People use these things to get their feelings down but I don't know what the hell to write about. So I'll write about the last 24 hours.  Mandy came over last night and we had a nice night. Today we just lay in bed all day doing nothing. There was another amazing storm again today. There has been loads lately for some reason, but I'm not complaining. I took a few pictures but I'm not really impressed with them. I need to set another date to venture off somewhere again with my camera, because my garden and my house are getting boring...  I must admit, the arguing has stopped with Mandy and I... but how long for? I think that's what I find scary... not knowing if it will go back to how it used to. But I only really have two choices...  1. End it and be miserable... 2. Stay with her and hope things won't turn bad but be scared in the meantime...  I got a text message earlier and grabbed my phone from Mandy's hand to read it. Seems stupid I know, but I just wanted to read it. I should've thought. It gave her suspicions. Well anyway, I told Mandy I have strong doubts about us still and that maybe being with her isn't such a good idea, but I soon changed my mind. We spent the whole time at the bus-stop hugging, but for some reason I felt kinda uncomfortable.  I don't know what's wrong with me. It isn't anything that Mandy has done... it's me. I wish I could read the signals my brain is trying to send me. Hopefully this is just a phase and it will be gone by tomorrow morning.  Sorry if this post seems retarded and stuff but I really don't care right now. Mandy just hung up on me without realising I was upset (immediately thinking I was angry - but I suppose my own human nature has brought that on)...
