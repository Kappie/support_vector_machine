It was fun and I was really proud of myself because I got onto Apollo's chariot, Alpengeiste, and Lochness Monster ^_^  And now I have a rash that kinda hurts in a place that shall go nameless.  That is all I really have to say for the sheer fact that I am kinda tired right now.  OH! I think I found a new favorite movie... Last night I saw the movie  Underworld.  It was great...
