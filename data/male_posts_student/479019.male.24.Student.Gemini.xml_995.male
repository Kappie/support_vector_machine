Oh and I also got phone service set up for Binghamton. (22 days away).  I spent most of the day watching movies. I watched  The Punisher  and  The  Girl Next Door .  Now playing:  Bad Religion  - Mediocrity  The Punisher was alright. It was bad, but wasn't great. I think the movie was afraid to go too far in terms of brutality. Instead it offered cartoonish violence. Also Kevin Nash looked damn silly in it.   The Girl Next Door was a sort of Pretty Woman story, only with teenagers and porn stars. It's basically a love makes you a better person story. This wasn't really a bad movie, but it was just decent enough to decently kill some time today.   Now playing:  Ataris  - Boys of Summer (cover)  Does love make you a better person? Call my a cynical bastard, but celebrity stalkers, and people in abusive relationships are examples of love being a bad thing. Then again I'm a person who makes jokes about corpses, torturing animals, and other things. That might explain my lack of a serious relationship in a while.   There should be some more fun going on tomorrow night.  ***
