It will let me practice and learn new skills and let me download lots and lots of stuff when I don't want to tie up my main desktop or even when I am not at home. Then I will hook my X-Box up to my network also then the fun will begin.   I drove past the fountain near Millplain and 164th st. and it was dry. I want to see suds!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Is that too much for a guy to ask?  I made my outline for my research paper. I even started the into and thesis too. I will finish it tomorrow. I can't seem to get into a groove here at work when it comes to English homework or art. Wow, I still have my final art project to do. I have to draw 5 objects that represent me. Can't I just draw a mushroom cloud and get it over with?????????  I have more and more ideas for new inventions or just improvements on existing stuff. I need to team up with someone who knows business and who believes in my visions.
