So far my favorite city has been Paris, and the Hiltons have been very nice too, ezpecially the Hitlon Arc de Triumph, which is spectacular. I have taken about 120 pics on my camera so far, but only 5 have me in them, which are the only ones my mom really cares about, she says i should just buy postcards of things that i dont have a picture of me in. i bought a whole bunch (maybe like 20) but only have afew peoples addresses that i know, so i guess ill keep the rest for myself. only thing im not looking forward to is the long airplane ride ahead. The tour went by very quickly. only today and tomorrows concert and then the next day is flying home. met a bunch of people who i didnt know from before. hope everything is going well in the states. gotta go!
