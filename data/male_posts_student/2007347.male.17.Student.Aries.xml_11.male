(and or woman)  that's not going to stop death. You can delay it a little. Your still going to die, and someone else who DIDN'T work for it will take it. What is that money worth then?   Cars. (except the Supra) will rust. Empires will fall. Fame fades. Time Heals All Wounds. Superficial thing are useless pursuits. And maybe you could say relationships are a goal, true love etc. etc. But YOUR STILL GOING TO DIE MOTHERFUCKER! That love will be forgotten, or the loved/lovers will die too.    when you really think about it. What really matters is that YOUR happy with your efforts. That you feel happy with yourself.    Everyone says when you die you remember everything.  Hell isn't fire. Or pain, or daemons. Its guilt. The guilt of a entire lifetime, to think about for Eternity.  guilt is what eats your soul.    that's what I was lightly saying when I said "id like to end up on my death bed with proof that in the end..... I didn't fuck up." I was hoping that I wouldn't have to say all of the above, and give further evidence of my fucked up ness but .......... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
