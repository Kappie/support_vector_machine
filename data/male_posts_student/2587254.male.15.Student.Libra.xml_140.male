I for myself, found it somewhat interesting hearing the biased thoughts of many intellectual humans speaking out against various things like Coca-Cola, the War in Iraq, Corporate Capitalism and many other issues. Obviously there were some issues I didn't agree with, but there's the pros and cons of everything in life isn't there? So today was spent much attending seminars (mine were mostly about the wars and conflict issues around the world), eating pizza @ Pizza Hut and coming home. Of course afterwards worship practice also....which we REALLY need to work on =P. Meh beats the more boring days of life though....i'd give this day a 7/10 probably....past mediocre but below GING AH!  My day started off at a healthy 730 once again today...morning went by quick since all I had to bring to school was a cell phone and my wallet. No classes today....since I went to SJN Now! meeting. So got to school around 805, sat around outside for a bit, and then bus boarding we went. I sat with Mophead to and from Althouse, and talked about random crap. Also talked to some other people also, but ride isn't that long to Althouse from Central Secondary School so in a matter of 10 minutes (we ain't exactly going across sometin like Metro Toronto) we arrived at the College by around......9ish? Retarded part was I had to go back to school anyways after the conference....even though I live only like....10 mins away. Come to think about it I shoulda just missed the bus and walked lol. Oh well.....anyways we got in, sat around in the auditorium, and then the conference started.  We started with a video, and then some people gave speeches. I kinda fell asleep slowly, but we were all dismissed for our seminars just in time, so no I didn't catch any shut-eye yet. Anyways....to my first seminar: War and Empire...  Hmm the speaker....Craig Simpson or sometin like that was talking about how USA spends way too much time on helping other countries, when their country is suffering enough. He actually came up with a very good point: with the $$$ USA spends on their 11 carrier battle groups (consisting usually of a aircraft carrier, 2 cruisers, 3 destroyers, and two subs, plus various other frigates and minesweepers), if they didn't spend it all on those 11 carrier battle groups, they could have probably solved their poverty issues by now. Plus....the money that Pentagon uses (which by the way they can use as much as they want) they could probably give Americans free health-care. Other things he touched up on include the 770+ bases that America now has around the world, plus the over 1100 bases in USA....all that money can do just WAAAY to much than can be mentioned. Basically....USA needs to learn how to spend their budget and also stay out of another country's issues. For example...also....America has never had any success in establishing governments. El Salvador, Cuba, Rwanda, and a host of other places. Bottom line: USA, stay out of another country's issues...and learn how to establish a democracy.  Seminar #2: Canada: a Peacekeeping Nation or Imperialist Country?  Now by the end of the seminar I still don't know where the dude stands....but my opinion is he was more towards peacekeeping, which I agree. However, Canada also does become imperialist sometimes, with capitalizing other countries with our banks, and also only helping those countries that may benefit our nation in return. Total human nature I know....the idea of helping and getting something in return...but we as people should really change that to God's image of helping everyone, regardless of getting anything in return or not. I really liked the 2nd one more as we had more discussion also, and...yeah I really enjoyed myself =).  LUNCHTIME! While walkin' in the halls....saw the Motorola T720's deficiency and how I'm happy I listened to the dude that I was gettin' cell phone from. Apparently T720 really does have crap receptio lol. Brittany Lockhart was right by the window on main floor and no reception sadly haha. Anywho, went to Pizza Hut with Hammond, where eventually we met up with Mophead there. Frederick would also be there, plus a whole host of other people. Mmmm....pizza. Pizza Hut so good. Well their slices are pretty good anyways, and we also bought a medium pizza and split it lol. Hey well worth it...more food than I'd get at Subway for the money I spent...only around 5 bucks =P. And I got....4 slices of pizza =P. Plus two cans of pop lol.  And we then went back for some guy talking about how his life got torn apart by Monsanto...the biotechnology corp. Unfortunately, I'm not interested in it...so I actually slept for 30 minutes, before Meg Tanner poked me, waking me up. Just in time though, since we had to go lol. So busing back to school, went to the music room to see when I'd get my practice log back, and John made a few burns to Mrs. Wharton lol.  "Hey Mrs. Wharton when are you going to get back from your surgery? Tell me when so I can start punching you in the gut again"  or:  "Hey Mrs. Wharton...while you're getting your hernia fixed think they'll give you a new pair of legs also?"  She's short...so get it now? lol. That one caused her to throw stuff at John though lol. Anyways after that, gave John a lift back, then I went home and immediately went for some sleep.  *Two hours later....actually more like 3*  Woke up, ate, got dressed, and headed for church. Though I was a bit late, we still got a few things done. I'm doing the presentation for Sunday, plus it'll be my premier on trombone I think =). Hmm....so we got some rehearsal done, and we still meetin' up Sunday mornin' @ 8:15am to finish it up. Then we finished, and I got home.  Yup....that pretty much sums up my 7/10 day. Maybe 7.5/10. It was pretty good though....and I'm once again looking forward to the next day =). Anywho I'm gonna go do something more productive than bloggin....like sleep or SC =).  Oh yes...and....   HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY JOY!  Lol....yeah bit past May 12th...but still wishin' ya a happy sweet....16?? I think =S. Well hope I'm right anyways haha...only 5 more months till I'm that old.  Later everyone.
