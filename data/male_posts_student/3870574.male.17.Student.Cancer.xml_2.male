Kerry has voted against a balanced budget amendment at least five times. Fiscally responsible? Kerry voted against President Bush's tax cuts which Alan Greenspan claimed to have pulled the economy out of the recession. "The first priority is the economy of our nation. And when you have a downturn in the economy, the last thing you do is raise taxes or cut spending. We shouldn't do either We need to maintain a course that hopefully will stimulate the economy...No, we should not raise taxes, but we have to put everything on the table to take a look at why we have this structural problem today... you don't want to raise taxes" (John Kerry on NBC's "Meet The Press," September 2, 2001)       Then, in April 2002, Kerry said he wanted a larger tax cut and was "not in favor of" a repeal. CNN's Tucker Carlson: "Senator Kerry...[many Democrats] [g]et a lot of political mileage out of criticizing [President Bush's tax cut], but nobody has the courage to say repeal it. Are you for repealing it?" Kerry: "It is not a question of courage... And it's not an issues right now. We passed appropriately a tax cut as a stimulus, some $40 billion. Many of us thought it should have even maybe been a little bit larger this last year...[T]he next tax cut doesn't take effect until 2004. If we can grow the economy enough between now and then, if we have sensible policies in place and make good choices, who knows what our choices will be. So it's simply not a ripe issues right now. And I'm not in favor of turning around and repealing it." (CNN's "Crossfire," April 16, 2002)      Eight months later? NBC's Tim Russert: "Senator...should we freeze or roll back the Bush tax cut?" Kerry: "Well, I wouldn't take away from people who've already been given their tax cut...What I would not do is give any new Bush tax cuts..." Russert: "So the tax cut that's scheduled to be implemented in the ocming years...." Kerry: "No new tax cut under the Bush plan...It doesn't make economic sense." Russert: "Now, this is a change, because let me show you what you said in September 2001 when I asked you the very same question." (NBC's "Meet The Press," December 1, 2002)      Kerry claims to want to make this a clean campaign, but in a statement he said on June 19th, 2003, he said that President Bush "misled every one of us." (Ron Fournier, "Kerry Says Bush Mislead Americans On War." The Associated Press, 6/19/03)      Four days days earlier?George Stephanopoulos: "People are really upset that they feel misled by President Bush on this issue of weapons of mass destruction. I know you said you're agnostic about whether or not he misled the public on weapons of mass destruction. But do you have a hunch on whether you think they hyped the intelligence?"John Kerry: "George, again, I think it would be irresponsible of me at this point to draw conclusions prior to all the evidence being on the table. What I know is we have to get that evidence. We have to have an investigation to know to a certainty whether or not it was hype, whether we were misled..." (ABC's "This Week," (6/15/03)        Kerry has voted for at seven major reductions in Defense and Military spending, neccessary for our national security.         In 1996 - Introduced bill to slash Defense Department Funding by $6.5 billion      In 1995 - Voted to feeze defense spending for seven years, slashing over $34 billion from Defense.         Fiscal 1996 Budget Resolution - Defense Freeze. "Harkin, D-Iowa, amendment to freeze defense spending for the next seven years. In 1993 - Introduced plan to cut numerous defense programs, including:          Cut the number of Navy submarines and their crews.      Reduce the number of light infantry units in the Army down to one.      Reduce tactical fighter wings in the Air Force.      Terminate the Navy's coastal mine-hunting ship program.       Force the retirement of no less than 60,000 members of the Armed Forces in one year         Military hardware he felt we nolong need since the "cold war" is past. The money would be better spent on "social" programs. These weapons are now the core of our military might:          The F-16 Fighting Falcons      B-1B's, B-2As, F-15 and F-16s       M1 Abrams      Patriot Missile      AH-64 Apache Helicoptor      Tomahawk Cruise Missile      Aegis Air-Defense Crusier         While running for Congress in 1972, Kerry promised to cut Defense Spending. "On what he'll do if he's elected to Congress," Kerry said he would 'bring a different kind og message to the president." He said he would, "Vote against military appropriations." (Candidate's For Congress Capture Campus in Andover," Lawrence [MA] Eagle-Tribune, 4/21/72)        I leave with this.        "So you can look at all the potential threats of the world, and when you add the expenditures of all our allies to the United States of America, you have to stop and say to yourself, 'What is it that we are really preparing for in a post-cold-war world?"-Senator John Kerry, Congressional Record, 5/15/96, p. S5061)        That makes me feel warm, how about you?
