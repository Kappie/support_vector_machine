Of course, they had to screw it all up the next season, but they still got the cup.   There's a senator in California who's trying to pass a bill that will allow 14 year olds to vote. The system works like this: 14-16 gets 1/4th a vote, 16-18 gets 1/2 a vote. Now, I don't know how many of you are in school or other close contact with 14-16 year olds, but this is about just as good as an idea as going up to a Marine and slapping him right in the face. You just don't do it, it's not smart. If this passes, then well, between that and the Californian recall, I say we just all group together and push California off the country. It can go hang out with Japan, or something.
