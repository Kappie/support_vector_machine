I fucking hate how my school talks about how our community is very clean, and drug free, when in reality there's practically a fucking ghetto in part of it and there's alchohol and drugs flowing freely into the hands of kids!!!! FUUUUUUUUUCK! it makes me so mad to see this shit! There's this street corner by my school, and all the ICP druggie fuckers go there to smoke before and after school, and i swear on my life that i have watched our school cop drive by them and not say a fucking word! thats total shiiiiit!!!!!! I mean, these little fucks will sit in my math class and talk about how they're gonna smoke pot over the weekend, and nobody gives two shits about it! and where the hell are they getting this shit?????!?!?!? I mean, i know that they get it ffrom friends, but where do the friends get it? And society makes drugs look funny and cool and not serious, i mean, look at all the sitcoms on tv cracking jokes about smoking pot and what not, very nonchalantly. I mean look at fucking movies for godsakes!!!!!! Cheech and Chong have been around forever making smoking pot look cool, and nobody gives two fucking shits about it!!!!!!!! i hate how our society is accepting marijuana as a normal thing for kids to get into, cause it realy fucking isn't.I cannot stand a society that accepts drugs and alchohol! I mean, why are cigarettes and beer fucking legal?!?!?!it makes no sense to me! And look at other places like amsterdam, where it's fucking legal to smoke pot there, aaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!!! makes me so godamned mad. I'm telling you guys, we need to reform and totally wipe this shit out. Do whatever you can around your town to fucking stomp these druggies out. I'm doing my best over here, try to do your part too.
