I’m pretty sure it’s a mindset thing but nevertheless… I then look to words of others like in books or in songs to help describe me. But you know that doesn’t work. They can come close, like in the song in the post below, but never accurate.   I’m going to be open here and present something I found that describes a lot of myself. It speaks of a personality trait that is a major part of who I am. Since this blog is mainly read by people familiar to me, it is a clearer picture of something that you may have noticed but couldn't quite put a finger on. (It explains the “Sng Bui (sour plum)” nickname that some use to refer to me.   Of course since this is the words of the author and still not of my own, it is not totally accurate (I would like to believe that I am not as bad as the character.heh.)   But I look at the character in question and I see a mirror. I can’t say the same for the situations that he faces (especially in Chapter 2) but I believe that I would have reacted the same way.
