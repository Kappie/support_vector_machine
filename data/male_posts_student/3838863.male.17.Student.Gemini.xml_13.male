She complained that my Boys are arrogant, over confident etc. Perhaps we're a little too ego bout our 'perfect' drill? lolx~ Yeaha. She was using her mother's handphone. Hope the radiation din kill her. lolx~  Wonderful time with Weichong again. I think the both of us can head for France to get married-cum-honeymoon this year end. lololx~ He'll knock my head if he sees this.. lolx~ We understood photosynthesis inside out and outside in. But i thought it wasn't really productive though. But i could tell he enjoyed it.  That's more than enuff as an accomplishment for today. =D  Oh ya. that fatty/fat ass/squirtle forgotten totally about our prayer group today. Cheated my feelings.  Made me wake up so early.  Emma must had missed me.  Gotta meet Emma in dreamland now. (Already running late..) lolx~ Adios shuai ges and mei nus.
