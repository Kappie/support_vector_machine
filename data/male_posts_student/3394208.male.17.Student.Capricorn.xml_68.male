Last thing I remember I was chillin at a party  Pinching girly’s asses I was drinking recklessly  I know I did something Lord what could it be?  Woke up in the morning And all my friends say me   What happened?   What am I doing here? Who is this girl in my bed?  What is this shit on my face? My god, what is that awful smell?   She may be an angel She may be a queen  She might be black, white, american, indian or japanese   Thru a bottle at a bouncer Didn’t think that he was cool  Pissed in someone's drink And thru a bike into a pool  Driving down the side walk Like a drunken possessed fool  I broke every single traffic rule.   What happened? What happened?   Let’s go
