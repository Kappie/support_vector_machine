About an hour ago, I pulled this stray hair (whisker?) from my sideburns (or the fuzz that passes for sideburns).  So annoying, because I'll just poke and prod long hairs on my fair until they come out.  I'M ADDICTED TO THE PAIN!!!!!!  Memory-  Terrence, Anita, and I used to always hang out.  This was around 9th grade, when I used to have a social life and be out on Friday.  So anyway, the three of us go to the videostore one night to get a movie.  We're feeling pretty bored so we get "O" not knowing much about it.    What can I say?  That movie, similar to Bamboozled, is a movie I'd never want to watch around white people.  Too make it worse, it was Marcus and Terrence two black guys, and Anita who is white.  Now check this, this movie is about a dude who is dating a white girl at a private school, and long in short he chokes her to death in the end.  Makes a dramatic speech about being a crazy black dude, then shoots himself (the DVD froze oddly at the moment he shot himself.  So you see the muzzle flash, and he buckles in but it stays like that for 10 seconds) needless to say we didn't talk about the movie.  Anita went and got the phone, and one of our parents drove us home.    It was a funny experience, because we didn't talk about it for months.  I guess the movie spoke for itself!  If anyone has seen "O" I'm sure they know what I'm talking about.
