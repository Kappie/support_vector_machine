I love stories, and why not share mine, even if I don't come off as well as I'd always like...part of the role of the entertainer is to entertain first and worry second.    But a hidden benefit to being a person with an open door policy is that you can keep a stash closed, a secret booty held close that no one is meant to see, and because everyone expects that you're sharing openly, they never ask about the other.  You live life asking questions rather than being asked...discourse is always on your terms.    I'm rewriting  Three Strikes  this semester, to help aide my somewhat weak creative portfolio, and in re-establishing the scene, I wrote this innocuous bit:   Blevins looks in the stands.  It?s a good crowd, about 2/3 full.  Kids with cotton candy, paying no heed to parental wishes.   No reason for it to register anything other than a visual of a youngster with a roll of fluffed sugar as big as their head, licking sticky fingers as parents maneuver to apply wet naps to the soiled places on the face.    But I'm immediately brought to a shiver, and a sense of responsibility that I never really wanted to face.  My innocence is stolen again, in a line that was designed to show the glory of innocence.    It was at least 10 years ago, but it's got to be 14, I'm sure.  The older you get, the less instant time seems, as you live with the current day you, and have to resort to the former yous when telling stories from those perspectives.  Yeah, I was in San Diego, so at the most I was 11.  I had found my way to the Safeway grocery store just a half mile or so from the house, buying a candy bar or a soda or a pint of ice cream...maybe I was buying batteries, because there's a story where I was swindled out of a dollar for batteries by a woman I recognized.    But that's not this story.  This story revolves around a father short on hair and patience, and his three year old daughter who bore a striking resemblence to my sister.  It was this that even got my attention...at 10 there's not a lot you pay attention to outside of yourself and candy.  I remember hearing stories about Marin's machinations when she was younger...how she wanted to run away, and how it worried my parents because she referred to herself as  Marin Alexis Moe County , and my parents imagined the adult finding Marin, flustered because a search through the phone book found no last names of County...  And I had no perspective of youthful exeuberence of my own, because I was me, and perspective is an ability lacking in the young, because perspective comes with distance, either in years or in persons.  So I just heard stories, and they resonated, and I imagined the girl with the box of cupcakes in front of me as the Marin of those stories, her own little actress playing her part in imagination.    Dad had groceries in his hand...fish, poultry, bread...I don't remember.  I do remember the girl following him obediently, except for the box of cupcakes she held extended from her body, a prize worth display for all.  Dad had asked her once to put them back, and he didn't want to do it again.  But he did.  There were lots of battles to be fought on his front, and his daughter's penchant for sugar wasn't one he had the energy or want to do now.  She wasn't getting the cupcakes, and he blindly hoped for acquiesence.      But she wasn't a cognizant tribesperson, understanding her father's troubles and the concept of giving one thing up to better later initiatives.  She was three.  And she did what a three year old who had found a six-pack of pink and yellow neon butter cream icing cupcakes would do--she kept them.   Because these were the ultimate cupcakes.  So powerful the look through plastic was that it converted her to consumer in seconds.  She could taste the icing, the sugar, the euphoria and smile that goes with the first, second, and every bite of a cupcake for inexplicable reasons.  It was real in her mind, and all she needed now was to put the real in her stomach.    In the end, it was the age that was her demise.  Still balancing the cupcakes in front of her, more delicately than a toddler ring bearer takes to his craft down the aisle, she manuevered behind him into the register line--past the chips, turn left, and make the slow arc towards the pay center.    Except she was three.  And she couldn't see in front of her for the cupcakes.  And lack of motor skill development combined with visual imparement meant disaster, disaster being a slight misstep.    To see it was not to notice a thing...girl walks, stumbles, and moves her hands towards her body in a reaction.  She never fell, she didn't miss another step.  She wasn't hurt, she didn't break anything.    But she did tip the cupcakes.    And the angelic pink and yellow neon butter cream icing cupcakes turned with her hands towards her body, except they weren't secure in their plastic, and they tumbled to the other side of the plastic, and the plastic bore the colorful consequence of youth.    She did something I never would have done...had I been in that situation, I would have turned and ran, cupcakes in hand, back to the bakery, where the cupcakes would be slid somewhere towards the back of the display, and I would return, wearing my guilt, to the line.  My mom would wonder what I did, but because the cupcakes were gone, she could turn her worry to the other stressors of her day.    No, she took responsibility immediately, an audacity for a three year old.  She tugged on dad's shirt.    At this point it might be important to point out the socioeconomics of the situation.  I lived in Rancho Bernardo, a semi-posh suburb of San Diego...no La Jolla, but a great place to live with a great school system.  We had a beautiful house, and a lot more money than I even imagined.  I didn't live with the knowledge of money, and money didn't really affect who I was...earlier in life we didn't have much, but at this point our family was relatively-well off.    And the father and daughter in front of me were poor, and to have realized it at that age solidifies the point tenfold.  Maybe that's why she reminded me of a young Marin, a Marin who lived her threes in Palm Springs, when my family had little financial wealth, and my mom was the high breadwinner.  She was there, wearing clothes a little too old and a little too outdated, even for a three year old.  Dad was poorly groomed, with poor stature and the stress of finding food overriding any created drama that affected most people at the Safeway.    Dad turned, first upset that she had kept the cupcakes.  Then he noticed the spill.  Annoyance turned to anger.  He tore the cupcakes from her small grasp, throwing them onto the conveyer.  "Well now we have to buy them," he said.    "But I don't want them now," she said.  It wasn't because they were ruined.    "That's too bad.  You are going to have to eat them now."  She mounted resistance, but her shame turned her cries soft.    The clerk waited impatiently for the father to stop admonishing his daughter.  When he turned to the clerk, he offered a small smile.  "Sorry," he said meekly.  He was in a lower place than she was, and his consumerism was a bother to her process.    All the while I stood behind, desparately wanting to step forward, tap the man on the shoulder, and tell him that I would buy the cupcakes.  I could eat them, that wasn't a problem.  Hell, I wanted some cupcakes.  Yes.  I really wanted cupcakes.  No, really.  It's no problem.  This works out all for the best.    But I couldn't.  Because it wasn't my place.  Or that's what I had been led to believe.  And maybe it wasn't.  Who is a 10 year old to step into the domestic dispute between a father and a child?    Yet of all the events in my 24 years, this one sticks with me to this day.  It's one that I hold closer than most every other, one that I never told a person...not parents, not family, not close friends, not girlfriends in a lamp-lit room in the early morning after a term of physical exposure that left us tired and nostalgic.  This was a story just for me.  Because in the end, I felt ashamed.  I felt like I was the one who spilled the cupcakes, and dad had to pay for it, and I knew that dad didn't have the money, but they were ruined, and someone had to pay, and now I was in trouble, but that wasn't the worst of it, because I had just made a bad situation worse, not for me, but just for.    They left that day, got into a beat-up blue Ford, and loudly thundered towards memory.  I bought whatever I bought, and consumed it as I walked home.  But I didn't enjoy it.  The cupcakes weren't transfixing anymore.
