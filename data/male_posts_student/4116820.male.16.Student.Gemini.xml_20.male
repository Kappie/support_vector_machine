Well I wasted my time I looked at all his campaign planks and that shit but found nothing that I like. Then I went to G.W.'s site same shit. Other then the war I don't support any of the planks either candidate has. I have yet to go to Ralph Nader's site but I better be impressed. I'm going to look now. Ralph looks like he'd be my vote. He has no chance but every vote counts. And while I'm talking about politics everyone needs to stop bitching about voting machines. Now in Cali. Blacks call punch ballots "discriminatory". Once again I herd that while listening to  The Tavis Smiley Show .
