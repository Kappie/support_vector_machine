In fact, the travelling isn't so bad - I avoid the rush hour and have a good book.  The infuriating thing is that I have quite literally spent 90% of my time either pissing about on the internet or doing paperwork (literally copying figures from a sheet onto a computer... fun!).  The only problem is that I have still got the security card that gets me anywhere in the building.  I guess I'll post it back - at least when I have received the cheque for last week's travel expenses (I wouldn't put it past her, I really wouldn't...)
