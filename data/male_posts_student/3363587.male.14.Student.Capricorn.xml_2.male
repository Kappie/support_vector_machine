I was, you know, practicing writing scores for the band sections...and I was actually doing a 3rd Clarinet score...alright...a semiquaver here...half rest, and FINALLY, a quaver to end it all! Oh, the joy in completing almost half an hour or hard work...but little did I know... ... Enter Kenrick... "Very good...so fast finish? hm...wait a minute...aren't you supposed to be doing the 3RD CLARINET score?" He said...a chill trickled its way down my spine...I then realized..."OH CRAP! THIS SCORE IS FOR 1ST CLARINET!!!" Man, you can't EVER realize the pain...Hahaz...Lesson learnt...KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN!! =p
