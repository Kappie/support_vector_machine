It's a music video for some techno that is based on the old theme song from Trans Formers.  It stars Soundwave, the giant Decepticon boombox, and a tape that shoots out of his chest.  If you don't remember him you will once you start watching it and remember the old show.  It takes a long ass time to load so be patient and make yourself a sandwich to eat while watching it.
