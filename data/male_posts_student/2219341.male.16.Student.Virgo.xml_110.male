GOODNESS!  maybe L will let me "borrow" hers!  hehehe!  fat chance.  well i've been pretty much bored all day.  nothin really goin on.  i am makin up some of this mexican chili bean stuff!  mmmmmmm...it smells so good.  my grandpa came up with it.  its actually very good...if you like mexican food.  yeah grandpa isnt doin so well.  he's in the hospital again.  he's probably not gonna last too much longer.  its sad i guess.  im really gonna miss him.  but at least he'll be free.  and hopefully ill see him again someday.
