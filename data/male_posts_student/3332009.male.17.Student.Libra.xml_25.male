The lecturers are so damm boring especially the Data Structure lecturer. She like lullaby. No kick. They make lectures all at the wrong timing. Nite lessons. When everyone is tired. The modules this semester looks quite tough. I must try my best to get through this semester without failing anything. So far my academic grades in poly is in the B and C  range.
