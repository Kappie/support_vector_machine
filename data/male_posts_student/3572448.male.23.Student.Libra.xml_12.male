That's basically how my day has gone thus far, pretty slow. the only thing that i've done is get a user's microphone working again, and that was just by plugging it back in....so now i'm killing time while i update another computer. only 2.5 hrs more to go...  However, it is kinda neat to be in charge while my boss is out. Hooray for the positive spin.
