But it will be good to get back to classes and see my classmates again. Lots of assignments coming up, although this year, for the first time ever, the different centres are making an effort to ensure that assignments are not all due at the same time. Previously each subject area sets their assignment dates without regard to anyone else, and students end up with multiple assignments due in the same week, and sometimes on the same day. Makes life that bit more exciting!  I'll also be catching up with a friend of mine who will be back from a year working as a nurse in Saudi Arabia. The situation at times over there has given me cause for concern, so I am very much relieved that she is still safe, and will be returning. She has been a friend since I was about 15 and going out with her best friend, (and she was seeing my best friend) and even though those relationships didn't last, the friendship that we have formed has lasted.  We've always been able to talk about anything, and on many occasions have provided support for each other. At many times other friends have asked us why we never got together, and the answer is simple. The friendship that we have, the ability to share things and get advice and support, is more important to us than a possible romantic relationship might be.  Finally on this week's social calendar, my flatmate Mike's birthday is next Tuesday, and a group are going bowling on Saturday night.
