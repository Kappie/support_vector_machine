But it sounds like a good thing to do. Hm.    Got some pictures scanned. For privacy, (No, they aren't like porno or anything, just dont want them being stolen or some crap..) anyone who wants to see them can contact me (unlikely) and I'll get the two pics to you. Planning on getting more scanned somehow.    Here's a recap of what's been up.         Dank's got problems. I can only advise you so far, man.     Irene says she'd be cool with hangin out anytime after 1pm. Rad.     Jonny's all over the Blogosphere. Jonny_D, people. Look out for him. He's everywhere. Like P.Diddy was last year.     Christina's in some church camp hangin around. Hope she brought enough makeup..     Carlos, think about breaking off from chicks for a while. You'll eventually lose the need for a stress ball. I wish I had your problems. Kinda.     Mike Carroll, still, I must say. Fuck you. ^_^     Becca's off in Canadia (I can spell the damn word, don't condescend) ....And apparently, she's hating it.  Sucks, eh?    Oh.    And the Rush tour is in less than 3 weeks. Goooood times.    Anything I missed? You know how to get ahold of me. Even if I barely know you, I'll put it up if it's interesting/funny. Time for someone else's rant to replace mine, you know?    Hopefully this blog won't be as dead in September. Hopefully none of you who read it died.  Anyways, see ya.
