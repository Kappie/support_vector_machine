Who would want to play with some little thing that isn't even cute and pokes you?  I mean really, what's up with that!  There are so many of them nowadays, and the story is always the same.  I also think team rocket belong in a mental institution because they're so stupid.  If the people at Nintendo continue to make the games so badly I think I may smite the all!                                                                    -God
