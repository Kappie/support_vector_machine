I hope that you enjoy on what I like to share with everybody on the net.   Through my growing through life I have notice that I'm learning new things from my parents, friends, and just watching people off the street. Many things I would like to say out loud to everyone, but my shyness usually slow me down on sharing on what is on my mind. It also has cause me to stay single....which I don't mind. It is very hard for me to share my feelings towards others. I have no idea why. The good news is that Im starting to open up my heart and mind towards the world. Anyways on what ever you do you shall not be scare to speak your mind, but be very careful with that. You still would want to show respect and honor to the person you are talking to. You don't want to get carry away on what you are saying. Honor is a very big thing for me. I hate whenever people would dishonor each other. The word honor is a big thing that in some cases it is hard to explain to somebody. So Im going to do the best that I can. Honor is a peron that has alot of respect for himself and for everyone else. He/she will never think lower of himself/herself or another person. That is what honor means to me......but there is more to it that is hard to explain. Anyways about speaking your mind, you should not care about what people think about because God(the big man upstairs) made each and everyone unique then others. So Im asking from each and everyone to be careful what you say to others, show everyone honor and don't be scare to speak out......the world wants to hear what you have to say.   Well this is my first thought, I will post other things of my thoughts whenever I think of them. Don't worry I learn something new everyday...lol. Anyways I hope that you enjoy this blog.   Laterdays
