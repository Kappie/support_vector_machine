I can remember reading all of the documents from or about Indians but that was almost 6 months ago. WOW this year flew by. Thomas you're stress level must be through the roof and Rachel that must have been the most fun you've ever had. Hmmmm... Sarcasm. My mind is still spewing literary terms. Ah almost time to sleep. Oh yeah Mrs. V-A,  You Rock . Bye Bye ~Frank
