"light" colour thingies are the ACTUAL waves of EM going into our eye...but reflected, that's just weird.  if you think about it, say for instance, look at a tree. the leaves look green yea? but the leaves should /technically/ be called _anti-green_...because the leaf accepts every colour EXCEPT for green. that green is then bounced back into our eyes, hits our retina and goes to our brain...then thinking..."OOOH! it's green." but it's not really, just _anti-green_. in that case, everything would change.... white  would because  black  because it's actually accepting _nothing_, and  black  would because  white , because it's accepting  everything ...interesting ain't it? but then, how could we define "anti-green" if we didn't know what  green  was? cuz then every thing would be  anti  and nothing would actually be the real thing.... so that's why i guess we call "anti"-green..."green".  i'll stop now....i've got a headache. signout: Wez [undignitary]
