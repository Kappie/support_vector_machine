Things like  "Cool things to change your name to...Ebrodak von Talisman! Nemo! Hercules! Xiahou Dun! Randy Valashek! Jamie Langenbrunner! Petr Sykora!"  and  "Strange things to change your name to...Zhuge Liang! (pronounced yoo-gay lee-ang) Jehan Snyers d'Attenhoven! Phil McCraken! and many more"  Yes, I had a boring French lesson =P School is once again here to haunt us all. But theres only 9 days of it left. During which time I gotta fit in truckloads of revision, hope Jack doesn't screw stuff up with Nat  even more  and hope to god Mr Upward's detention letter(s) don't get through. And all the prom stuff, too. That'll be fun...seems to be Nat's least favourite conversation topic. Whoopeedoo. Anyways, its back to the random thoughts for me.  "Why the hell am I still here? What is Adam Hart-Davis still doing on TV? Why can't Mat even spell the name of his college course? How did (other) Ben manage to loose his bag? Why does it have to keep raining? They really ought to hurry up and invent the time machine."
