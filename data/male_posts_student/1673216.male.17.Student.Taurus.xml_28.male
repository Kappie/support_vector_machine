Scott - He went home for the night..he doesn't work nights. Customer- Oh, because my name is Nick. Me (as I am finishing up scooping his 4$ ice cream) Well in that case, this will be free. Customer (With a -huge- look of excitement, mouth open and eyes wide) - REALLY? Me - Nope just kidding (ring up the food)  Me (Serving up a two flavoured double cone) - Do you care which flavour is on the top or the bottom? 40 year old customer - No I don't care if I'm on top or --- (looks behind him at the two 14 year old girls) Uh...nevermind.. Me (Can't scoop because of laughter)
