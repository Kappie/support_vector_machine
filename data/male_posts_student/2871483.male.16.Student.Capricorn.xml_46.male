All the teachers as scrambling to finish a unit before WASL, in which we will forget everything we have learned.  Easy week, filled with movies (October Sky, Beauty and the Beast and Babe en espanol, Gattaca, and that frustratingly dramatic Julius Caesar we all love!), annoyingly boring WASL prep, and neat 50's tune's in Cranny's class that I haven't heard in awhile.  Just another excuse to get my groove on in History.  That groove and good spirit carried over to English, where Mrs. Klaas crushed it into the ground.  She is the only woman I know who is evil enough to destroy the good feeling I get from 50's music.  Damn her, she's inhuman!  -  After school, I checked out Room 210, where Mr. Allen confessed to have missinformed me about a meeting which is next friday.  So I walked to Gramms' house.  -  We took Bridget to the Pet Wash where, like always, my allergies attack in full force.  Not fun.  Bridget looks cute now, though still really fat.  -  Afterwards, psycho grandmum was conviced we needed to get her new computer tonight, even though I was really freaken' tired from washing that damn dog.  Whatever, I got Wendy's and Kill Bill out of the deal.  Win win.  Plus I got rid of that damn Wal-Mart gift certificate that has been haunting my wallet since Christmas.  -  I need to try and get some more sleep.  I may or may not be seeing Kill Bill Volume 2 tomorrow, but I will see it one way or another.
