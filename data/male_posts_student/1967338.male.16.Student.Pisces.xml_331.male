Let me be the first to extend Jonah congratulations on six months of hilarity, Norwegians and cod analogies. May there be many, many more.  Jonah also has been busy elsewhere as he has taken over my old site, which has moved to a new address  urlLink here  I wish he would have come up with something less obvious than changing one word in the title, but hey, what can you do...  Incidentially, because I know that this is going to come up, I am posting at the same rate that I normally do. You are all just posting dramatically less. Just wanted to point that out so that we don't have another "You're taking over the blog!" controversy. Just for the record: Marten last posted 11 February, Erin last posted 15 February, Sophia last posted 15 February, Nathan last posted 16 February, and Jonah last posted 10 February. Basically I'm saying post more! I'm bored and lonely here!  It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals they treat your dashboard with.
