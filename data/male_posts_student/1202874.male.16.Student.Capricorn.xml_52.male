(sarcastically amber suggested that we would. i think i might have to embarrass her by carrying that idea out.) don't get me wrong, i am exstatically happy that she is my girlfriend. just the whole everybody knowing thing is weird. cause then somebody always has to be up in ur business like "did you know amber was talking to so and so after 5th period?"   and through all this i'm extremely excited about tonight. amber and i are going bowling with some of her friends and possibly one or two of mine. the only part of that sentence that matters to me was: amber and i. even though we have talked on the phone for about... hold on checking the minutes... 1481 minutes (not including peak minutes) the past two weeks i haven't really been able to see her out of school. thats just no good. its gonna be an awesome night. hope yours is too. i'm out.
