I thought to myself, 'it must be hard to be a single dad.' he was feeding his boy, the boy looked as though he would be about four or five. The kid said to his dad, 'daddy? When is mommy coming back from vacation?' the dad tried to think of something fast. He told the boy, 'she isn't coming back son. She left me and you here so we can find her later on.' I didn't get what he meant at first but the guy was trying to say that the wife either passed away or that she had left with another guy. I felt for this kid, my mom had to tell this to me also. She told me that my dad was gone for a while and that I would see him but he wouldn't come home. It must be hard to be a single parent. I also had another observation. At this girls house I went to tonight, I saw three girls. We arrived at this girls house, all 6 of us, and we were escorted to the basement. The girls could've had their pick of any of the guys in the room, I know because they were all single. These girls set it up strategically to talk to different guys. I don't think it was that obvious to the simple male mind, but I can see through girls that I know I cant have. These girls have worked this before and had another group of guys coming after our group had its 'time limit.' I find it funny to watch them implement a game plan.
