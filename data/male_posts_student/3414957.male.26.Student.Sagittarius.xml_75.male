Its all quiet here and thats cool but I am just thinking about that person who wasn't my friend. I know I shouldn't even write about that here but who cares, its my website!!!!!!!!! I still feel saddend. Not as bad but still I wonder what the hell?? How could I let myself fall and fall hard? I think I am insane. We all are insane but I can see that I am insane and I am comfortable with that. I am not comfortable with society and what it thinks is normal though.  3 more hours to go until I can go home. 60 more years until I die or maybe sooner who knows? I was thinking about stopping by a bar before I go home and relax but then who am I kidding, I can't relax anywhere but my cave of a room. Thats my own little world there.
