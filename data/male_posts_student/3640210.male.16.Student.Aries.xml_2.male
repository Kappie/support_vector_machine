They have a pop punk sound, catchy songs, fairly straight forward lyrics, and seem to be pretty good overall even though they don't have a terribly unique sound. These downloads are from their first EP (that I may actually buy) which apparently has the same quality of work throughout. I particuraly like ' urlLink Dream ' which I've found I can relate to quite well while getting sucked in by the druming and overall energy of the song... Hope you enjoy listening.
