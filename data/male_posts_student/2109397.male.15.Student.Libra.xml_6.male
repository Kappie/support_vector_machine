       
      Bad day today very bad day.  I was sick and throwing up all day and then I get this email from my soccer manager about how I missed practice. He said there was no notification even though my sister tried their house but it was busy and then he asked on the email if he wanted me to remove my name from the roster. I was like bastard! I am serioously contemplating quitting though because it isnt any fun anymore. I might even switch clubs behind they back if someone else would take me. It could also be our Interim Coach but I think it's the whole thing. Somebody help me please.
