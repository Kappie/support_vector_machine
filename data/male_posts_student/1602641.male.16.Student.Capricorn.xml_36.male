Hmmm... intriguing. This is kind of a time capsule - I wonder what interesting details of the here and now I should include in here. Oh! I know... people will soon forget about John Ashcroft's stay in the hospital with a bad case of pancreatitis, and that is as it should be. But let us not forget the delightful notion of John Ashcroft, father of the Patriot Act and grand pisser-on of American civil liberties, being HOPPED UP ON MORPHINE. I mean, just imagine! No disrespect to our distinguished attorney general, but I think that even he would admit that that whole idea is pretty damn funny. He should go on Letterman and do one of those top 10 lists - Best Things John Ashcroft Said While On Morphine. That would be frickin' awesome.
