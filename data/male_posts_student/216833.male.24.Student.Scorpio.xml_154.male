I get these urges to take their snappy attitudes by the hair and slam them into the glass cases. Maybe I will light up some fucking 80's metal as loud as it will go and start hi-kicking random people in the gut. Tomorrow I am off and I am gonna try and make it out to Mount St. Helena and hike to the top. Being outside away from people is my only solice these days. Once I reach the top I will let out a nice tribute scream to 80's metal! Listen closely...Dee Snider! This guy I work with, Matt, has invited me to his house about 4 times now and offered to go on hikes with me several times. I feel bad, because the guy is alright but he is still a fucking insecure tool obviously looking for a friend. Poor guy hates his wife and they have been married for just a month more than mimi and I. Where Not Gonna Take IT! I can't seem to find my way out of this pit of depression. I guess it is only a pitty party, so fuck it. What do I need to do? Then Fucking get it done!! It's that simple. Since my dog went to the hospital, I havn't been to the gym. I will get some excercise tomorrow on the mountain. I will take some pictures - I hope it is not hazy tomorrow becuase I want the full on view from the highest point in the Bay Area. I really had fun with mimi last night. We played abalone and I am totally hooked. She kicked my ass 2 out of 3 times, but it was still fun.   current mood:  pessimistic current music: Iron Madien - The Trooper
