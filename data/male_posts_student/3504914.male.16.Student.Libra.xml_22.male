Reason for my dumbass of the day is because I had to endure the torture of that song, argh, devil knows its name. It goes something like… Wait, I just remembered why I hate it so much… Its  A)	Cyclic B)	Impossible for me to understand So sorry if I can’t provide you with the lyrics. I would listen to the  Macarena  song for eternity if it meant not listening to that song for a micro-second. Savvy.    Topic :  Beyond Good  Evil   No, not the book by Nietzsche. No, not the game. This subject is about why movies picture the world in black and white. Now, I’m only going to scrutinise one movie, but if it is so demanded, I’ll analyse more to demonstrate what I mean.   Let’s take  Hannibal , the movie. Because I’m reading the book, I have a lot to evaluate the movie with. NOW, for anybody who hasn’t watched  Silence of the Lambs ,  Hannibal , or  Red Dragon , let me fill you in.   There’s a bloke in these movies named Hannibal Lecter (doesn’t the name just dispatch chills through yer bones?), who is, in simpleton terms, a psychopath. This guy is probably one of the most chilling villains I’ve ever seen, simply because he’s intelligent, and can be compassionate (not a great deal but still). So why is he a psycho? Most people don’t rip your liver out for a meal. Now that we’ve established him to be an academic cannibal, let’s get into the film.  Throughout the entirety of this movie, Lecter is painted as a disturbed madcap incapable of feelings and such, and makes him a character you have no sentiments for. THE STEREOTYPICAL VILLAIN. You’re probably asking me “how else should we feel about a human eater?” Well, in no point of the movie do you discern Lecter’s background, (SPOILER ALERT), where his sister gets eaten up while he’s a child. Yes, there’s a reason he’s the way he is, it’s his past. You discover this in the book, not the movie.   Why?   BECAUSE THE DIRECTOR WANTS YOU TO FEEL NOTHING BUT SPITE FOR HANNIBAL. Why though? Why not create a little sympathy? Because the director feels that he should never make the viewer question whether the villain is really so bad after all.   Why not? Because otherwise we wouldn’t want the typical action movie so badly as we do now.   It’s a sad truth that the majority of people fail to think for themselves and believe that the world is divided in two halves, good and evil. In World War 2, it can be said the Allies were the good guys, and the Nazis were the bad guys. Truth be told, it was the case. Now, in Iraq, the American government pushes that they are the ones doing good, and the Iraqis are the evil bastards who deserve to be killed. Is it so? No. Lets not get into politics though, that will be for some other time.   Point is that the public demands this sort of movie because they can’t think that maybe the bad guys are actually good at heart and such. It makes us easier to see them die. We watch war movies because we’re convinced that the people we follow are necessarily in the right. In  Star Wars , we root for the Jedi, and boo the Sith simply because the Jedi are said to be good. We accept that as a fact. Which is why I applaud Lucas for  Episode 2 , which brings about the question of bad in good. I hated the movie, but I applaud the thought.   Ah, I’m beating around the bush. I’ve already made my point.   Arguments?
