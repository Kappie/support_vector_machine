Stayed there until 6ish, and it was nice and not raining and even a few sunny minutes, the trillium were in bloom, and i caught the tail end of the swamp buttercups(not sure what they really are called, but jannie and i call 'em swamp buttercups)The birds were singing very loud, and we did some clean up from the logging that went on last winter for jannies road out to the knoll. I think i sprained or pulled my shoulder or something. Very painfull. Yesterday. Came home by 12:30 and spent the day in, listening to the rain. Went grocery shopping. Started sewing patchwork again. Nothing really new
