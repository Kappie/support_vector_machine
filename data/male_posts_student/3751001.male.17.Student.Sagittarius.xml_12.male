I went to sort out the problems with my bank card and the woman said that a replacement will be sent out with all money intact :D .  My next bout of happiness comes with the end of the saga which has been troubling my wonderful family for many weeks/months. The guy came and fixed the loose roof slates and plastered my cieling again, still they was a leak. Second time he looked at the tank in the loft, still a leak and now he has finally found the problem :D .  I decided to have a look in the loft for the first time in my life, the roof is very low and you just about crawl around like a rat, its also surprisingly warm because of our decent insulation. He explained what was up, i understood, my mother did not :P .  Alot of people I know are on holiday with the exception of Vix and Chris, my mother and brother are going away somewhere very shortly which is definate as the leak is now fixed (or will be on saturday).  I'm gonna get a few pounds to spend on plenty of junk food and possibly a nice little gift for myself, i'll invite a few people around if they want to come and we will plug up some consoles into the widescreen tv and get some decent music (also known as rock) blasting out and annoying the neighbours.  There goes my reputation as a fairly decent teenager... oh well i'm not a chav!  Overall i'm quite happy except my desire for a nice young lady to fall in love with. I'm open to offers! I try not to be fussy with what i want, i dont want skinny or obese, i'm not bothered about breasts, i like nice eyes to glare into and soft hair and preferably she needs to have similar interests.  The girl I like is a freind, I want it to be more but it will not happen but i've not given up because she is far too nice for that. Never in my life have I met someone as amazing as her, she is unique but she is kind and loving, she is beautiful on the outside too but she doesn't love me in that way :'( .  Oh well I'm not giving up, I can't give her up.
