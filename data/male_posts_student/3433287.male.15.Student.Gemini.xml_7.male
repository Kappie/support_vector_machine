I experience that...all the fucking time, and it is really starting to fuck with/worry me.  Having it with daily experiences is normal to me now, but just a day or so ago...i had it while playing Ninja Guiden, and that fucked my head up...   I have dreams, and these dreams are like reality to me, then i forget about them for a while, then i experience that exact same thing (same time, same place, same situation) sooner or later.  My brain flashes and i remember the situation, and i think im dreaming...then i "wake up"...but not from sleep.  When this happens to a person more than often...for me lets say...atleast once a day, it really fucks with ya.  Studies have proven (and all the researchers believe that) the "mind" is not centrally located in the brain, it is made up throughout the whole body, it is affected by physically and mental things.  Have you ever thought about when your reading a book, that you can actually hear yourself reading?  Well take that to the next level and while reading picture yourself reading the book without breaking your concentration.  Now stop reading this and go pick yourself up a copy of SPIRITWALKER by Hank somethin...ask me for more details.  If you know what the Shamans are and what they could accomplish...your on the right track...
