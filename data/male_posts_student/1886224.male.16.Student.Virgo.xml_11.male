According to them, we didn't have the permits to play on a field that no one was using at the time. In a way, its kinda good that we didn't play. Most of the people on the other team were graduating seniors! I'm only a sophmore! Some league we play in. I'm gonna play some Desert Combat now. Until next time, peace out!
