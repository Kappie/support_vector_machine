I'm free all this weekend. :) Ok, so this Orlando gathering is coming up so quick! Ahh speaking of Orlando, I have all of a sudden got this weird obsession with Orlando Bloom. I've always thought he was hot, but now i think hes extremely handsome. Anyone agree with me??? We can sorta stalk him together, lol. So yeah, i am so ready for this vacation to Florida. Ahh Becca i dont have a cell phone or i would tell you it. I wish there was another way we could keep in contact. :(. We also need to have another movie night in August. Krista, if you wanna do yours just tell me. If not, I'd be happy to have one at my house. OMG KRISTA, i think i left some of my brothers movies in your van on the way back from Kristin's, because i dont have them here and my brother is gettin a lil angry. Just write me back or call me. I really wanna hang out with you guys! Again, i feel so bad that i have neglected to write to you guys! im sorry!!! write me back or call me and we will fo sho hang out! Love, Rach
