Cammie and me hit lots of rocks - big rocks - emotionally and now we're better. it was really tough cuz i think she loves me or something and doesnt want to say it, cuz she thinks i might not feel the same way. i cant say i blame her cuz from what happened with tally, its hard to say i love someone new. schools out finally, and i didnt beat bob up. goin to canada for a fuckin week on saturday, and its a two day drive just to get there. Staying in banff, alberta. goin with mckinley and stuff. i hope i dont get too bored. sounds boring. on the way bak i get to buy firecrackers and stuff from the indian reservation though, so that'll b fun. tubs of it. wow mckinley just reminded me he has one of my magic decks, so i hope my good cards are in there. ive been looking everywhere for them! im such a nerd, o well. its a fun game, really. i dont see why ppl have to look down upon ppl from doing stuff they like. w/e, doesnt matter to me. hopefully IHS wont hate too much. o god IHS is gonna b sooo lame. im not looking too forward to it. ill miss all the friends i guess i made at MMS, but i wanna start over. screwd up too many times.
