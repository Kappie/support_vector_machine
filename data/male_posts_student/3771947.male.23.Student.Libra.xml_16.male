Everytime something right happens, something wrong does to even it out.  It's if my life is a perpetual roller coaster.  I am never high or low for any great amount of time.  I've opened up and explained myself who knows where it will get me or if I should have.    Fate, if its real then I've already made these decisions, or, they have been made for me.  Am I the master of my own destiny?  Do I meet certain people for certain reasons?  The search for the meaning of life is the greatest quest a man can undertake, the only one that has never been finished.  Maybe there is no answer.  I am supposed to meet Jen at the beach.  I guess I better call and figure out what I'm doing.  Also, I need a damn cell phone...  I guess one can only go so long in the stone age.  Last year on this day, I was sitting on top of the museum in An Nasariah Iraq, wondering if I will ever be home and free.  I try to remember what I learned in Iraq everyday.  Nothing should EVER be taken for granted, life is short live everyday as if its your last, and everything we have are gifts.    Finding a roommate at GU is not any easy task.  I am emailing a bunch of guys.  Hopefully I will find the right one.  You can only learn so much about a person from a computer screen.  Remember that.    My father is the best man in the world.  I am so lucky to have him.  Sunday, he is coming over to help me finish parts of the house.  The damn power went out yesterday, and I'm sure certain people are already making assumptions.  I can't wait to deal with that...
