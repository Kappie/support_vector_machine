One might classify her as a goth, as she fits a lot of the stereotypes: red-streaked hair, dark makeup, black clothing, spiky wristbands, dark poetry. Being a former cutter only adds to the mix. (To those not in the know, cutters cut their flesh with razors and watch it bleed.) Granted, she is a very nice person, if a bit shallow at times - sometimes her being goth seems like a gimmick, like she goes out of her way to be one, so it's not natural.  I am going to add that Emily is ridiculously attractive, and if it were not for my incredible mental discipline, I would pounce on her in an orgasmic rage. I mean it. But I look at personality before looks, and in fact, when I used to think Emily a total bitch, it didn't even strike me that she had big breasts then, or that her hair was some of the coolest around. This goes for everyone. In any case, I cannot make love to her, though a part of me wants to. Really wants to.  I am not a goth. I am in fact a respectable young man, good grades, glasses, polite, short haircut. (Though the last is actually a recent, and unintentional, addition.) I am a writer, but whenever I've tried to do something 'gothic', I realize how incredibly idiotic the stuff is. (Spiderwebs, suicide, vampirism, spooky spooky!) So, in short, with my enthusiastic love of life and my to-the-eye conformist attitudes, one would not think this is the girl I'd be with.  In any case, I care for Emily, if you believe it. I really do. She's had a rough life. Her mother was a raging alcoholic, and Emily coped by going goth. Things are actually getting better for her as she has moved in with her father's family. As I mentioned, she used to be a cutter. She stopped. I've gotten to know her over the last year, and grown to like her, because she's funny, she's smart, and she's adorable. Recently, I asked her out. For all her faults, I love her.  But it is thrown into question as to whether she is the one. I am the type to believe in omens, and I was recently sent one. It was a fortunetelling, silly stuff, but it confirmed a suspicion I had a week earlier told myself was unfounded: that Emily will not work out.  Somehow I knew this. Emily is I think very sad, and I am happy. I almost think my happiness drives her deeper into sorrow, and this affects me, and makes me sad. But as soon as I think of something else, I am happy again. It's like a sadness of pity, an emotion of no substance. Being Emily's boyfriend makes her feel awkward almost, as I guess I'm so, well, normal - her first boyfriend was a 'vampire,' and her second a drunken hick who showered once every two weeks or so. Both mostly just tried to get in her pants. (I might want to, but I don't say anything. Besides, I morally couldn't knowing it probably won't work.) But I definitely make her feel awkward. I told her I loved her on the phone once, and she kind of freaked. I found it cute how the next day she subtly poked me to her own blog, where she talked about me having said that. Cute and sad.  So, we know it isn't going to work. But what if I drop her? She dropped the vampire freak, she dropped the fifteen-year-old alcoholic. But if I drop her, being the only normal person she's ever had a relationship with, what then? Perhaps she goes back to one of her exes, and she caves on their demands for a blowjob, the fucking perverts. In any case, how do I live with myself knowing I've broken this girl's dreams? Maybe I'm underestimating her, maybe I am being a sexist and assuming she'll fall apart without me. But I can't help it.  So that's it. Life sucks, doesn't it?
