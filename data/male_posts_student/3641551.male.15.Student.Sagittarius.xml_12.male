Times when you feel like the whole world is crashing down on you...   Times of extreme elation and almighty sadness...    And you realise that you have matured.    Look at your secondary one to four photoes if you don't believe me. But that's only the physical maturation. What is much more important is your emotional and mental maturation.      Your future is in question but your present is not. You control the present. It is ultimatedly your choice whether down the road when you look back at your teenage years, you look with a happy face or a frown.       Your fate is up to you to decide...       Religion can only guide you, it's your choice in the end that counts.      Treasure it...        You only have one chance to live it...
