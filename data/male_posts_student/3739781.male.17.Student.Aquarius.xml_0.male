I'll be there for 10 months, then I'll fly into California for a few weeks then back to home. Just keep checking here and I'll try and give updates as often as possible, or just when I feel like it. I might just get another site that's better though, but I'll make sure to tell everyone what's happening with the site.  Ok so here is the real LOW down. I leave august 5th at 10:21am from Dayton, heading to DETROIT (DETROIT ROCK CITY)! Then I get to wait in the airport for 5 hours........*sigh*. Then I leave from Detroit to Tokyo at 3:45pm on a 15 hour flight, yes I am planning on drugging myself so I can't be awake for that hell. Then I arrive in Tokyo at 5:35pm on August 6th. Then I get to wait for another two hours in the airport. Then I get on another plane at 7:40pm and head off for a 12 hour flight to BKK, Thailand and I arrive at 11:50pm to be greeted by my host family, and a ton of other people who I won't know or be able to speak to. Then I have a 7 hour drive to Kantralak, Si Sa Ket (Si Sa Ket is the province I'll be living in).  That's the travel portion of my trip. Its really cool though the town I'm going to be living in, there will be two other exchange students Denise (from Brazil). Denise is there right now and she'll be in Thailand till January. Also the best part is that she will be living right across the street from me which I am completely stoked about! Then there is Maria (from Germany). I've talked to her a lot as well and she is really cool. I'm really really excited about this trip and I know it won't be my last trip, I will be all over every time I can.   So there's the deal, I would tell you about my family but I really don't feel like it right now, so maybe next time, or never I don't know but I've gotta jet
