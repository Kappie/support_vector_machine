In other news, I have decided that as soon as my kid can walk, they are going to be potty trained. This  will  happen. I had a fun little experience with a 3 year old this past Sunday that I never want repeated. Ever. **sterilizes hands again**  Humm, so did you hear they are making a new 50 dollar bill? Yeah, I know. Looks like I'll have a more difficult time printin' em out. Darn those new hues. This makes my life so much more stressful. How will I pay for my TrippleX clothes? The skinny girls get all the deals. **shrugs** Recently I purchased a parachute, and might I say what a wise investment. They are colorful, durable, a little tight but modest enough, and they serve a dual purpose. I am currently unemployed, but I think modeling could prove to be an excellent career choice for me sometime in the near future. Everyone needs some wholesome Jenna: A picture of perfect health. Perhaps I could enter a pageant for a few bucks? I would need money to spend on a personal coach though. So if you would like to sponsor me speak up. Personal coaches are the best, you pay them to fluff your ego and fill you with a false sense of pride. Whoa, *idea*, I could totally pull that one off. I mean getting paid to sit down, eat and lie? Who could pass that up?....ahhh, so many jobs for the Jenna, so little time.   Speaking of time, look how much I just wasted yours. Comment if you luff me.
