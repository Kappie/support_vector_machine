Hello + BloggerBot is this new service where they'll take your photos and host them for you. Hello is sort of this IM program and BloggerBot goes on your Friends list. Then you just send messages with pictures to BloggerBot (with a caption) and it uploads and publishes to your blog. Anyway, this is just a test picture but its of my room.. a while ago. I think I was building two computers for my dad and everything was a mess. A few years ago a friend of our family asked if we would hire this refugee from Croatia to clean our house once a week. We didn't really want to hire her (my mom enjoyed looking on as she forced her 3 child-slaves to vacuum the rugs)... but we did anyway. So she comes every Saturday morning and I'm always woken up by her ringing the doorbell. I have to pile all the crap in my room onto my bed. At the time when this photo was taken, this created a hazardous situation. Indeed.
