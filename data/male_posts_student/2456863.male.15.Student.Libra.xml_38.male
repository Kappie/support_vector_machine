I realized today how much I use rain and storms as figures of speech, its kinda funny actually.  I'm gonna print some stuff for my planner after i put these poems in i think.    "Like Rain" Like rain, It falls down on me. The Thunderstorm, So silently. I'm drenched. But I don't care.  For hours I walk. The mellow radiance, The gentle hum, For me they are no menace. I'm exhausted. But I don't care.  Twelve o?clock. A brawl yonder, under the clouds, But not the only one; There is one that draws no crowds. I'm confused. But I don't care.  Like rain, It falls down on me. The Thunderstorm, So silently. I'm dying. But I don't care.     "Fourty-Two" Sunset came out this morning. Sunrise slept in, Last night was busy. Moonlight is coming through the grass. Tonight, Sunshine will be bright. Earth equals six times eight.   This came from when me  Jamie were talking going to the library and he?s talking about how the answer to the universe is 42 and earth = 6*8 and that?s why the world is messed up cuz 6*8 is 48 not 42.  Crazy.
