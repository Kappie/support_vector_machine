They, like the other bands playing last night, I had heard of, but never seen. They were actually pretty good. They had trombone and sax, but it was really ska. It was pretty punk and they had a lot of energy, which was good. Madcap was pretty whatever. I wasn't really impressed. Audio Karate put on a good show. Lots of energy from the crowd and some new songs were debuted.  I'm much more excited about MTX than the show last night.  They're a band I've been listening to for a while and wanted to see the last few times they passed through, but I couldn't make it.  ***
