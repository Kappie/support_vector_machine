I don't know how or why he does that, but his excuse is that he's trying to rub my head.  I don't know, I just know he won't be doing it again. No French Toast or waffles this morning.  So I had about two or three hashbrown patty things.  Good enough, I reckon.  We were packed and on the road by nine, and we haven't stopped until lunch, save one time at a rest area.  At lunch we stopped at another rest area, though this one had picnic tables and whatnot.  Sandwhiches and pepsis and then back on the road.  We've had to stop for gas twice since we left, as opposed to once on the way up here.  And I do believe the quality of the roads has worsened since Thursday.  I was going to write about today sooner, in West Virginia, but the road was so rough the laptop was not atop my lap at all, but rather 2-3 inches in the air at anytime.  Needless to say, I couldn't read either, not without dying my book an ugly yellowish brown color. So, I slept.  Now [break: "Jacob? Got your can of cristo read yet?" "no"] let me set the record straight.  I love sleeping.  I don't however, love sleeping after I've woken up and been awake for a few hours.  Also, I don't love sleeping in the/a car, I absolutely detest it. It is most uncomfortable and although it passes the time like nothing else, it passes the time in an uncomfortable dream state filled with terrible dreams of weird stuff and bad movies. But I slept none the less. I woke up on a smooth road. So I automatically new I was in virginia and almost home, so I hurried and logged on to the laptop to finish the trip summary.  I wrote this sentence.  I then wrote this sentence.  I inhaled.  I pressed the shift and alt keys consecutively for five minutes to no purpose. And I shutdown the laptop as we near my house.
