I currently work at a used car dealership doing the website -  urlLink Autohaus Webb  - and I get to drive around those cars some.  I've been coming up with various other ideas, such as pen making, and web design.  Now to just put them into action.  Oh yeah, and I've been reading good books (The Color of Water).  Anyways, I'm going to check out the blogger api tonight, and hopefully within the next couple days I will have created a blogging app for os x that will make it so I needn't blog through blogger.com itself, rather so that I can just type and edit and whatnot through a program on my comp.  This blog will probably be a variety of personal, technical, philosophical, business-oriented, and just plain rambling blogs, so I hope you enjoy this as much as I hope I do.
