I was able to cross the dreaded raging river we call midterms though, in my opinion, I was not actually able to satisfy the items of the test fully because of lack of time...I do hope to get a C+ or higher as I have (according to the work Mark has already released) a C+ standing and a higher standing is actually better...  3. I was able to sign-up for volunteer work in the COMELEC for Freshman Elections on Thursday-Friday and if I am going to complete all my shifts there (meaning spending ALL my break times at the polling station)...I have already completed my required service hours...so I my burden has now lightened...  However, I still have a ton of work in my plate...that will require more rigorous chewing and tearing before I achieve the required results...  1. Research Paper in English--meaning interviews to be conducted, related literature to be read, and so forth...  2. Quiz in English--damn! we have a quiz on wednesday? on fallacies...we are now discussing logic and critical thinking and its kinda nice having Gimo utter these latin phrases such as petitio principii and ignoratio elenchi...  3. Report in Literature--War by Luigi Pirandello and I can not make anything out of the story, really...oh well...  4. Report in Filipino--Di Ko Masilip ang Langit ni Benjamin Pascual and this will happen tomorrow and we (meaning to say TEAM ABUSO) are not that prepared but we have the ideas and stuff...and that is important...  5. Midterms in Filipino--I have to read a ton of stories in Hulagpos that I have not read before...*sigh*  6. Paper on the Short Story for Literature--well, I have not read the selections yet and I better start doing it if I want to get something as decent as B+ or higher...  7. Quiz in Math--oh...this is tomorrow, helpless...I'll just use my time for other stuff...hehehe...on second thought...I am now focusing on Extrema...  So there...happy??? I sure was but not anymore...   --Work, Work, Work--
