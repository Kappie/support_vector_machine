REALLY REALLY BAD.  Actually, it's more like a someONE... >>> >>> >>> ***NOTE*** To Michael John Bartkiewicz and Laura Ann Pittenger, this is where you STOP reading.  If you do choose to read on, DO NOT complain to me.  You have been warned... >>> >>> >>> *sighs, cries* Why the hell don't I ever get anything I want?  God is not being a generous person to me.  He'd rather give me nothing and watch me suffer.  Look at this:  And the Lord God was bored.  The Lord God descended to earth in the form of parents and restricted Brandon from doing what he wanted.  The Lord God only did this to fuck with him. -Book of Moshe 1:1-3  and this:  *scolds god* what the hell were you thinking? making parents so mean?  go to your room, youre grounded... no, dont take that tone with me young man, now go! *turns around, smiles, lightning bolt whizzes past head* hey! thats it! im taking away your allowance... yea thats right... dont you throw a temper tantrum, youre 7 billion years old, youre too old to throw a temper tantrum... thats right... *quiet*  You see that?  That's me.  OK, now listen.  What I want is gonna sound really stupid to everyone, but I'm making it known out of spite.  I want to be with Hillary, every moment of my life.  I know you all think that I'm crazy, and that I'm obsessed and whatever, but just listen.  I really do mean it when I say that I love her.  I really do love her.  I do need to be with her.  I really don't know what else to say, but the pain from not being with her grows worse every night, like it's eating away at the inside of me.  If I'm not with her soon, it'll completely devour me.  I just need to put that down.  That is all...
