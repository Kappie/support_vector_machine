I did notice some themes, however.  My infatuation with Natalie Imbruglia's music, embarrassingly, is one of them.  It also reminded me that it's been a few months since I've listened to her albums and I should dig them out again.  Then--just now--it made me think about the number of times I've written about Natalie Imbruglia on the internet.  I Googled " urlLink Schrock Imbruglia " and came up with 600 entries.  Maybe three of them are mine, but now you understand the intertwinificationatory relationship our DNA-- OUR VERY BEING --has.  I also wrote a lot of posts about Subway Sandwiches.  That doesn't make sense at all.  I also found out  urlLink Kate Schrock  is a nationally known musical artist of the singer/songwriter variety.  Check out  urlLink pics of me  if I were a woman and decent musician living in Maine.  Hey, she reads the New York Times too!
