Daniel and a few other friends of ours came to join us. PoorDaniel , had to wake up early just to miss a train ; and when he finally made it here at 9.30am , we we're supposed to leave at 10. ( kafaii told him we're leaving at 9 lol ) Anyways we took a tram to our destination. Smith Street is filled with factory outlets like Nike , Adidas , Reebok and so forth therefore making it a perfect place for me to get a pair of walking shoes. The shoe i brought here was spoilt during camp time. How sad. It was my favourite shoe too , a Nike Shox Limitless. Oh well , at least i got myself a nice Converse shoe for 49.95 $ and an orange Nike T for 10 bucks. Not a bad bargain huh. Kafaii and the rest also found themselves on a spending spree, buying shirts , jackets and shoes. We bumped into a few other college friends on the way and they too joined the party and we had lunch together.  Later that night, me and Daniel went for dinner at China Town. After that , we decided since we had nothing to do why not crash Jenshen and Kwok Liang'splace. They have after all, a Gamecube and not to mention alot of snacks.Keewwlllll ! So we did , and George came over too so we played multiplayer games till about midnight.Not fair , they have a bigger apartment than us =(   Sunday morning , woke up pretty late today. Once again we joined our friends to eat at an Indonesian restaurant. Then it we went grocery shopping. Didn't take too long , managed to stock up on food and snacks. Its amazing how small this world is , we bumped into nearly half of thefast track students. Things got pretty boring after that. Daniel played the comp while i took a nap. For dinner , we we're joined by George and a friend of his to get a nice hot bowl of Vietnamese beef noodles. MMMHHMMMMM
