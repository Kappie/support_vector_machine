Full-time report:- FRANCE   2-1   ENGLAND '91 Zidane     '38 Lampard '93 Zidane pen ::France in the second-half did better but still not good enough to beat the stubborn English defence. ::The English defence played well for the 90 minutes. ::Zidane and Henry played better in the 2nd half. ::In the 1st min of extra time,Heskey fouled Makelele just outside the box and Zidane took it superbly with a curling shot past James,who was staring at it. ::Then at the last minute of extra time,the shock came when Cole wanted to clear the ball but Gerrard hit it back for James when Henry was there walking around and he sprint past James and James had to foul him and caused a penalty. ::Zidane slot the penalty in and the whole crowd was stunned by the 'crazy 2 minutes'.  Conclusion:The French were really lucky but it was also England's fault as they didn't score after scoring just 1 and leading only by 1-0.They defended well but thye should have tried to score at least 1 more goal as they should know the French attack is one of the best in Europe.The French took advantage of the two set pieces rewarded at the dying minutes and it was really the Zidane show.Beckham should also be blamed for MISSING A PENALTY so he also should be partially blamed for the defeat.Now France get off to a winning start while England grieve over the deafeat after leading for such a long time.Now England must buck up get points from the Switzerland  Croatia game to at least qualify fir the quarter-finals.  _::signin' off:UrCh!n::_
