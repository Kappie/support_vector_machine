I fucking deserve it too. I worked my ass off this year. One more year to go, *sigh*  I just finished what I hope to be my last cigarette before I goto sleep. They usually relax me and allow me to close my eyes in peace :)  My fucking website is down right now. Stupid server shit. I can hardly wait until I move so I can set my server up on my other computer I don't use. Then we won't have to worry about these "minor setbacks" will we?  I promised Dicaz I'd mention her in one of my posts. So I am. We need to get drunk man. I could go for some nice cold beer this weekend. I need to get smashed; it's been awhile. More or less since Liisa's going away party. We got smashed and sang karaoke. It was massive fun.  It's pouring rain and I can hear the taps of the water on the basement windows. It's so relaxing. I just hope it doesn't rain all day because I have to take the city bus to work today. :( Dirty ass bus.  By the end of the summer I'll have my car :) Until then it's bus for me.   Well thought I'd make a quick post before I head to sleep for the rest of the morning. Maybe I'll be up before noon again tomorrow, eh? I doubt that :P  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Good night, morning, afternoon or whatever to you all :)
