Okay, watever, a cell ohone wouldn't make that diference in my life, but, why did he tell me that he would give me one? I should had known for the first time he said that, that he was lying. I got really upset!!   And really sad too, because that time it was a cell phone, but in the next time, it could be something bigger, i know it may sound silly, but i cryed a little before sleeping, not just because dad had lied, but also because i felt alone and kinda helpless.  Not much to talk about, i went to english course, and the teacher gave a pro test, it was a listening test. He dicted some sentences and everyone thought that was hard, and when they asked me if i thought that was hard, I said "no", because that wasn't, if the teacher hadn't repeated twice, that would be dificultm but he did and that was easy. And at the gym, It was just the usual, last afternoon, a frind that works out there too, said that beside the male restroom is the female's restroom and he heard her pooping... HAuHAuHAuHAuHAu. That was just the funniest..i laughed alot, and coming home i saw a girl , she almost fell down, and I couldn't hold my laugh.. and she realized that I was laughing. Poor her, but i couldn't help!
