I’ve been having a blast:  Thursday 6/17: adam g and I chilled at darin’s for a bit, picked up jacki p and heather f and ate food at wendy’s. brought it back to the smut house for a small gathering. I drunk a few  beers  and ill will hooked us up with some phat bags.   Friday 6/18: jay, kev, and I drove to the shore and was one of the first ones there. We claimed a house in the name of smut and began  drinking . The night was short because everyone didn’t get there until 2am or so. Won all the flip cup games I played. The sun rose around 5 am and we all went swimming in the ocean. I fell asleep on the beach at 9am. It was a lot of fun. Good smutty times.  Saturday 6/19: chris drove us home at noon. slept all day. Got up, picked up the girls, drunk some  beer  and ate some chicken soup.  Sunday 6/20: graduation! Took a lot of pictures of the grads. Went out to dinner with the family. Drunk a lot at laurens. Went to katies party where she had 3  kegs . Everyone was there. It was a lot of fun!  Monday 6/21:  played a small game of ultimate Frisbee at north Garnerville, chilled at hoyers, played some holdem, drank a  beer , blazed with j fizzle, eat a lot of food  Tuesday 6/22: had a small smut party where I played a lot of beer pong, funneled a lot of mixed drinks and beer, had a piss drunk conversation with jena m, it was all a lot of fun until I  blacked out next to toilet at 11pm . I heard ppl were hanging outside when I was unconscious. I am furious!  Wednesday 6/23: I don’t know how I woke up alive at 8am. I didn’t want to wake up, God could have killed me from alcohol poisoning and  I would have died happy .. I was terribly sick, I didn’t stop puking until noon, but at 2 pm went swimming at laurens, felt 100x better, me and nick blazed in the car 3 separate times, barbequed food, bought tix for spiderman 2 midnight screening, went swimming again at 10pm, went back here and ran the table in holdem. Good fun times.  Wow I  drank six nights in a row  without even knowing it. I remember the DARE program back in middle school. Everything officer Williams said about alcohol and drugs is true. This sucks balls. I’m cracked out and I want to drink right now. This unhealthy lifestyle is starting to bug me.  I need a smart girl to keep me away from this shit ... I start work Monday, full time. Until then, stay smutty!
