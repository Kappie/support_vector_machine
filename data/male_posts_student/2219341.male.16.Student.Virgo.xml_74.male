    
       the cries of a weary soul.  unable to stop these tears of anguish.  these tears of a longing that will not die.  they fall and no one hears.  no one sees.  they are the tears of a lost heart.  a heart that hopes...that dreams.  a heart that lives...haunted by the memories.  please Lord...help me...hear my prayer...
