Just like my bro said "If anyone asks me what is that movie talking about, well... AVP" lol  I bought "Ladies  Gentleman  The Best of George Michael"  two days ago. It contains 24 the most popular MTVs of George Michael. Totally worth it!!  Two weeks left and I am heading to Toronto. Whether being excited or nervous, I am going to take that chance to learn as much as possible.  Last weekend to enjoy and I will get back to work, Good luck to me
