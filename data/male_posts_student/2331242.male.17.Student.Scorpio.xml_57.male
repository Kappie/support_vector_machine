It really doesn't concern me, though. What will happen, will happen. I'm gonna look over my notes for a few more minutes, and then call it a night.  CityFest Live is this weekend. Hehe, I hope I don't have any dreams about wrecking the car, like I did on this night one year ago (I smacked into Lauren Brantley the next day).  Well, back to work.  Te quiero, Martha. Me alegro de que estes bien y feliz. Nos vemos ma√±ana (finalmente).  Hope that was understandable :P
