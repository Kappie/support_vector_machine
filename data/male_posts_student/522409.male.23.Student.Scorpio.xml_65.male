This is our 10th year on Cape Cod, and so this week was our reunion week, with the 10th reunion show happening on Wednesday night.  We had 9 of the 10 original members, including 2 all the way from Kenya.  A total of 35 men took the stage that night, of the 43 who have been through this experience.  It has been a rather incredible week of storytelling, debauchery, and once in a while, even singing.  I've had a wonderful time, especially because, as I've noted at one or two shows this week, it's the one week this summer where my position in the group (historian/alumni coordinator) is relevant. :)  Samrat just called me.  He got a small speaking role on the Sopranos.  Dr. Singh.  The lip smack that Danielle and I endorsed so enthusiastically on Wednesday night was the clincher.  No joke, says he.  There are still so many people crawling all over this house.  We've had 7 visitors from Buffalo camping in our back yard for the last week, and it's gotten to the point where everyone in the house is generally frustrated, because there's no place to go in the house where you can be alone.  I like company sometimes, but mostly I just like being alone, or with one or two other people.  That's just how I am.  It's hard to think with a lot of people around, and I spend a lot of time living in my head.  Steph and Dre are coming to visit tonight.  Steph is a friend from high school and Dre is one of her sorority sisters from UNH.  The three of us are living together in Boston starting this September, and I'm very excited.  I've decided that I want to start working on my first jazz album.  Yes, my album.  I've been writing during the last week, and it's a lot of stuff that I'm actually really excited about for once.  Jazz.  Yay for jazz.  A few standards I'm dying to record, too: My Foolish Heart, Detour Ahead, Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most, Waters of March, Wait Til you See Her... it'll be fun.  Just gotta find some guys to play.  That's where Berklee comes into play.  Game on.  Tomorrow, you're coming to visit.  You already know I can't wait, but I'll say it again--I can't wait.    Tonight, Hyannis show and party, but first, we're playing mini golf and having dinner with the remaining alumni.  What a great day.  Choppy thoughts, choppy sentences, choppy blog.  Thanks for reading.
