 I'm at the Doctors in Aylsham at the mo, doing some work exp, good fun, aye! Just been out on some visits to oldies, nice! doing some stats and figures at the mo, so thought that in between ebaying and work, I'd post something. Just got a new laptop yesterday, its a fucking beast! P4, 512 DDR, DVD+RW, 40Gb HDD, 128mb ATI Radeon and more! Now guess what I paid for this 16" laptop...... £600! A bargin, i barted this dude in John Lewis down so much firstly because the ad was wrong, it was scrated a tad and then just to take the piss, knocked £80 off! Also, dad has finally agreed to buy a new desktop as ours just died and I can't be bothered to fix it in my pathetic ways any more. Its a nice one, sort of standard lower market spec, P4, Nvidia 128mb, 120Gb, DVD+/-RW, 256 DDR. But a nice 17" TFT. I can't wait for it to arrive so I can have my way with it!!! Tee heee. 
  
 Well, I strimmed the field last night so it's all ready for our party! I've done a cool layout and I'm plaaning for it to be between the 3rd and the 10th, in that week. So when do you and Jez get back? 
  
 Well, must do some work now, or they will pump me full of drugs and sell my body parts for spares...... honest
