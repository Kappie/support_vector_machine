I'm glad you've finally admitted the whole thing . . .you're awfully stubborn, despite being the love of my life. ^_~  How was shopping?  And I don't have any idea what you mean about cold weather - were you standing outside again?  You know that's not healthy. *looks guilty*  Not really much to say today . . .spent a very long time in waiting rooms. . . first for the animals, then for an eye appointment . . .on the up side, I re-finished Hitchhiker's.  Later, then, and Happy Almost New Year.
