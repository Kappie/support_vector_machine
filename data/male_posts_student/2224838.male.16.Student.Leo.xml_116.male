The site is cool because it includes information about the equipment and editing techniques that he uses to make all of his music videos and movies. It seems as though he is completely willing to answer any questions that people ask in the discussion board as well. That's pretty cool if you ask me.   Anyway, if you haven't seen any of his videos before, then be sure to check some of them out in the "VIDEOS" section. You're also supposed to able to buy his DVD  urlLink "XDOANEX" at Best Buy , but my brother hasn't been able to find it in the store as of yet.
