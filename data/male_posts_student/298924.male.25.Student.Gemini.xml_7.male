Since the cable was out I took the oppurtunity to watch Snatch....it was pretty funny....not as funny as the level people had hyped it to, but it had it's quality moment....I'd give it a 7 out of 10....  Last night, on an impulse I went to a step show....man....I should have known it would turn into a clownfest....I went with 5 girls (a story in and of itself)....and one of them has this guy she messes with and for the first time I noticed that this niggas head is on some massive proportion type shit....I'm talking bout I couldn't make up what kind of shoes he had on, he was that far away, but his head looked like he was right in my face....I mean dude's head is massive....then one of them said, "Look, there is Fetus!"....at that moment I had to check myself cuz I could not believe that she had just called a nigga Fetus....so I asked her if that was what she said and she said yeah....I almost died laughing....then I asked was that his name and she was like, "No, he just looks sorta like a Fetus"....now maybe I have spent one too many hours in Dr. Dereimer's Embryology lecture but that was the funniest thing ever....anyway the various jokes cracked almost made up for the fact that A Phi A, AKA, DST, and Que Psi Phi did not participate in the "step show"....how are you gonna have a step show without the Big Four???....bullshit I tell you....not to mention the bootleg dancing groups and singers they had up there....lets put it this way....when I left I did not care who had won....  Oh well....time to head back down into the dungeon that is Gross Lab
