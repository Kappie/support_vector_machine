     
      This is my penultimate weekend in Denver.  I don't think it will be a particularly big weekend, because I am really tired from staying up so late last night, and I want to be well rested for next weekend's activities.   I am also playing golf tomorrow.  Joel, sweet Man U jersey.   Latah.
