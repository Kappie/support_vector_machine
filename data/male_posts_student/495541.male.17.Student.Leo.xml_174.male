I really feel for the people going through a lot of stuff :-\  The school year is almost over!  Dang it's gone really fast.  I never thought it would go this fast but it did.  Wow.  We have like 3 weeks or something?  That's awesome.  So I think I'm going to do my homework now.  It's not 11 o'clock.  This is amazing.   Listening to: Jurassic 5 - "Woe Is Me"
