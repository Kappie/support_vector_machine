Artspace Projects, a national, nonprofit organization, is working with the City of Buffalo, New York to study the creation of a major, multipurpose arts facility in Buffalo, which would include space for arts organizations and other businesses as well as affordable living and working space for artists and their families. sounds cool... i hope they get to rehab and reuse some of the old brick buildings downtown.  the potential for successful reuse of many buildings is there... it'll be nice that this organization is looking to move on that potential.  as long as people are jumping in... i think that gives others more confidence to take a chance and jump in on their own projects and developments.  it'd be nice if we could reach a point here... where that's self-sustainable, and government won't always need to step in to make things happen.  hillary clinton (and chuck schumer) is/are awesome.  i have to give props to both... as they seem to be aware that there's more to new york state than nyc.  so it turns out they've done some research and hashed out a  urlLink proposal  for a regional county government.  the proposal would dissolve the city of buffalo, and setup a county run government.  i hope people vote 'yes'... it makes sense.  right now, the city is pitted against the suburbs vying for businesses... and businesses aren't hesitating on asking local governments what tax breaks and amneties they can get if they relocate across town and city lines.  i feel we need a one central regional government that controls all these deals that go on... and one central body that plans for the region.  we've spent far too long fighting and competing between neighbors... instead of working together to benefit the local area.  maybe in the future... if this ends up working out well... we can merge niagara county in as well... and maybe even out to rochester and monroe county.  the more that we are a unified bloc... the better we can counter downstate and all our tax dollars that get funneled down there.   urlLink this  makes me sad.  i met a lot of interesting, and smart people during these last couple years... and many have moved on to other industries.  though silicon valley was a total sausage area... i think it would've been cool to have worked and experienced life out there for a little bit at least.  i always looked on in amazement while sitting in a car and driving down some of the main roads... as buildings with the names and logos of apple, oracle, google, hp, sun, all passed by.
