Ran into Angela. I never really was friends with her, she was more of a friend of a friend, but I bought her and her friends a drink anyway, danced a little. Nice to see some familiar faces. Going through my phone book the other day, I noticed her phone number was in there. Did I put that there? Maybe. I can't remember. I probably won't use it anyway.  Going to Lethbridge next weekend. Got bill for dentistry work yesterday, got reminder notice for insurance yesterday, cell phone bill should be here in a few days. Going to be a tough two weeks. Probably will not pay dentist for another two weeks. Good thing my work benefits are covering most of it. Probably won't pay cell phone bill until later, either. Singed up for long distance calling plan on cell phone. Now need to find someone to call long distance? Probable waste of money.  Going to be expensive trip to Lethbridge, I think. What with bars and tattoos. Or piercings.  See. Told ya. Nothing.  Oh yeah, Scottish girl is back in the mall, this time her booth is set up directly outside of RadioShack. Heh Heh.
