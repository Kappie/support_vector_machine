GROUP A Portugal Greece Spain Russia  GROUP B France England Switzerland Croatia  GROUP C Sweden Bulgaria Denmark Italy  GROUP D Czech Republic Latvia Germany Netherlands  OK lets see. Group A should be fairly straightforward, Spain and Portugal going through. Group B should be France and England. Group C should be Italy, then whoever wins the Sweden/Denmark fixture. Group D could be any of of the Czechs, the Dutch and the Germans.  After that, England face either Spain or Portugal (assuming those 3 go through). Which is a bit of a bugger, really. Oh well.  GO ENGLAND!
