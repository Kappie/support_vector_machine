Yeah, it was BCL's Baby, or Tyke's new laptop. BCL's Baby is its name. So Tyke played around with that for a while. Some software and a few cables are still coming in a little bit so he doesn't have everything yet. But everything works and the screen is big and pretty cool. So that will entertain Tyke for a while. During the day Tyke went out to pick up a Measles immunization form from the doctor and the girl who gave it to him is the RA of the floor below Tyke at WSU. That was a little weird. Tyke got a call from Bondage in the afternoon so he went over to his house and played poker with Bondage and Shane. Then Pinneo came over and later MSwa came over. Tyke was winning for most of the time but ended up losing 10. He got 3 straights and a flush in the first 4 hands he was dealt though. That was cool except he hardly got any money out of the hands. During the game Tyke called Purdy to see if she was going to the Inn at night but she wasn't so Tyke tagged along with Bondage and they went down and met up with some of the ladies at Sunset and then drove from there with Pinneo. They took a nice route and had some good times on the way. Then Bondage thought he knew which hall they were holding The Inn in but yeah, he was wrong. So they missed like a half hour of it cuz they were on the floor below The Inn. But they did sign some card for two people getting married. They just copied exactly what was written in the signature above. After the Inn they went to Bubble Tea for the first time ever. Tyke really does hate the bubbles. They're so annoying. So he got a cup and every time he got some balls in a sip he would spit them in the cup. Ingenious idea. After bubble tea they went to a place that some people might think Tyke wouldn't go to. But they went to a hookah bar. Tyke is still not 18 so he couldn't legally buy it but he did try it. He really didn't like it though. There was nothing that was good about it he thought. The best part was seeing smoke come out of his mouth. Other than that it didn't do anything for him. And it left a bad aftertaste. Everyone else liked it and they did it enough to get a buzz from it but Tyke only did it like 10 times max. They finally left at like 12:20 and then went to Sunset so Tyke could get his car and then he came home. So he did quite a few things today that were fun and one that was informational. He now knows he doesn't like hookah. He actually still sorta smells like it too and it isn't that great of a smell. But tomorrow Tyke is not looking forward to. Cuz he has to drive all the way out to Pullman and then stay there for 3 days for Alive! That is going to suck a lot. If he gets lucky he can make a friend but he thinks it might just be super sucky. And he'll be gone for 3 days which won't be fun. So it's just not a good combo. Oh, this would be the last blog then. Cuz he probably isn't going to be taking his laptop and blogging. He could...hmmm...he's gonna have to see about this. But don't expect a blog. Not until Friday. Then he'll have one for sure. Until then.
