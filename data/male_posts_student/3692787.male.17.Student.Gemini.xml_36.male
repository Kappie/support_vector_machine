And who would have thought that now, aside from academic shell and minor mishaps, this so-called love is tearing me apart? I would definitely be the last one to expect this.  For all its seeming frivolity, its devouring of the internals, and the sleepless nights it entails, the love is surely of no fleeting quality, like this one you experience when you are exasperated over this traffic jam or something. Sure once in a while I get to take her off my mind, like when I get to catch a nap, watch some WWE, and munch on a really nice chocolate bar. But then again, when I start complying with my acad papers, I get to be ensnared by her strong command of this written word. When I board my morning jeepney, I get to see her face on this passenger in front of me. And when I begin my MP3 ritual, right then and there, at this flash of this first beat—I get to hear her voice resonating from this slim wire of my headset. I’ve done all sorts of suppression, and yet, at this end of this day, everything I’ve tried fails.  Oftentimes, I wish the law could have just ordered me to prop myself against the wall and face a vandal-free partition. Just so I could momentarily take my mind off of her. Just so I could focus my energies on what primarily matters then: studies, family, friends, and even my occasional tantrums. But now, I realize, it’s no longer a life for myself alone; it has fast metamorphosed into a life where she is but a vital installation.  Clearing it out, she hasn’t even shown any sign of reciprocating the goddamn feeling. And yet, I’m already on the verge of being dispatched to a mental asylum. I am not under a conducive state of mind to analyze what the heck struck me, but as far as I’m concerned, this prognosis is somewhat clear: I’m always thinking and looking out for her.  Perhaps, what hit me exists in a yet unplumbed realm.  Well, the joke must really be on me. In spite of the intense affection I harbor, I cannot summon a bit of courage to blurt it out straight to her nonchalant face. How I wish two templates were aptly mounted on my mind. This first one, when she decides she could actually reciprocate the love. This template would propel electrons to rush through every nerve of my body, pleasing me enough that I no longer want a million dollars or a 1.0 in my subjects. And this other template, when she sports an empty face after I drop the bomb, initiating a torturous silence enough for me to shove myself beneath the ground. This template would activate a thousand profanities, and transform me into one raving lunatic screaming at the top of his lungs: Damn you! What kind of monster are you to lure me into thinking that you can eventually love me back? How dare you disrupt the harmonious equilibrium of my tedious life! How sadistic of you to have treated me so well only to leave me here, hanging and gasping for breath!  I never wanted to entertain any thoughts of expecting something in return, but I am no phony showbiz personality to deny that some part of me is still hoping that someday, somewhere, I’ll get to have a share of her affection. Or even love. During the dead of the night, this dream sinks in an irrepressible manner: I see her hand perfectly fitting mine, both of us fooling around at the outskirts of this campus. This world is all black and blue and we don’t give a single care. All else fades in the background.  But of course, I do not subsist in a world where “the perfect ending” does. And so during moments of desperation, I get to wallow at the idea of her one day falling for another guy. Although it lacerates big time, a surge of realization creeps through the fantasy: She may, or most likely, may not be in love with me. I may just be another fan fancying the hottest movie star in town. I may just be another bookworm delighting over the omnipotent hero. Or…  I may just be another best friend stereotype from all those teen movies who has no other purpose than for ego-boosting debates, for YM chats when no one is online on her list, and for listening to her when her man isn’t treating her right.  I hate to make it sound as if she was born to inflict pain on my person or something. And I despise more the fact that while thoughts of her console me during my refuge at dusk, this same musings of her confront me with this reality that not everyone escapes unscathed in this sojourn called love, if one may even call it love when only one of these two parties may be at the receiving end.  Being a firm believer of synchronicity, my hopes are held high: this universe will pity me and somehow conspire to make her mine. If not, would it be too bad to move a few limbs to make it happen all by myself? I’ve been thrust into the guessing games, but in the one, clues come as seldom as Halley’s Comet does. And I’m already running out of oxygen, ready to expire anytime. Will she even turn back when I give her a tap on the shoulder? Or am I going to forever lure myself into thinking that persistence comes with a prize?  Whatever this structured ending may be, it’s but a pleasant surprise that I somehow get to gamble and play my cards. I know I am not the only one dwelling in this sea of hoping and wishing and being crushed by someone. There are plenty of us out there, and who knows, maybe I am one of those who are just hoaxed by a nasty farce and bound for the scrap heap.  If only forgetting love is as easy as shipping out of the wrong room, saying to yourself “Oh no, you have entered the wrong door today. This is not where you are supposed to go…” ------------------------------ completely wrong thought of the day: Crossing streets is starting to suck immensely. Damn cars don't know when to stop! It's not like video games where you get a continue if you get run over either. You get hit, you DIE. Time your touchdown Superbowl-winning run wrong and you won't get a second try. It's like, SPLAT! Congratulations! You're roadkill!
