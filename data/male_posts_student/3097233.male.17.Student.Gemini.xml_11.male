At times there were long periods of droughts and then instantly it may change to strong blizzards and then to flash floods thawipeded away crops (those which could make it through the first two extremes). Tornados and dust storms also plagued thprairieses and made the land desolate and near useless. The Dust Bowl has many other names though, like ‘The Dirty Thirties’, ‘The Dust Bowl Days’, ‘Black Blizzard’, or ‘Black Roller’; all of which give their own little insight into opinions of the 1930s and the harsh life styles of the time. 	 The 1930s did not start off like many would expect for how poorly they ended. The Oklahoma Panhandle and top region of Texas had been threceivingnd reciving praise for the massive amounts of wheat crops that were produced. Though as the decade ran on, the crops began to ‘dry up’ and become smaller and weaker, the soil becoming drained and useless from over farming and not using crop rotations.   The harsh weather was mainly focused around Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and other states from ranging between Nevada and Arkansas. People from these states were gidisrespectfuldisrispectful nicknames from those that lived in states that were not as affected by the Dust Bowl, like ‘Okies’, ‘Arkies’, and other names.  	Books have been written about the Dust bowl, like ‘The Grapes Steinbeck’ by John Stienbeck, ‘Out of the Dust’ written by Karen Hesse. Each of the stories tell how the rough life during dust storms, the loss of lives, reclaimsoyed crops, reposesed lands, and pains.  	Many died from trying to get away from the Dust Bowl after the banks reclaimed the lands which the sharecroppers were on, using a tractor which could plow and take the place of many single men working on farms, making the chance for output of the farms higher. This meant that there were many homeless farmers that were forced off their lands that generations had lived on.  	The droinhts began in 1930, in the East, and then by 1934 the Mid-West had been turned into a huge desert,  Though the droughts had been common in patterns in average of 25 years apart, this was one of the worse cases. Though dust was not the only thing that the Dust Bowl brought along; phemonia, suffocation, dehydration, hunger, and many other kinds of deseases plagued lives in the 1930s.  	The main route that was taken to escape the barren lands was Route 66 which ran from East Coast to West Coast. Used car sales took off as familpossessionsost or all possesions so that they would have enough money to buy a car and to make the trip, though many times the cars broke down and they did not have the money to repair them, or they ran out of gas too far from a gas station. Highways were littpossessionsjunk cars, possesions, and bodies/graves of those that did not make it the rest of the way out of the Dust Bowl.  	If and when the families made it away from the Dust Bowl there was the problem of work. Children as young as sevelderked along side eldery, men, and women alike. Many took any job that was available from picking fruit or cotton to the lowest and most demeaning of jobs. Though children ages 14 and below were not allowed to work in factories because of child labor laws, they still agricultureo work in agricolture.   	The Dust Bowl swept around the US, and by 1934 had covered around 75% of the United States and wasseverelying 27 states severly.  On April 14 Black Sunday. The worst "black blizzard" of the Dust Bowl occurs, causing extensive damage. Named after Black Tuesday, when the stock market crashed.  	The ending of the Dust Bowl came in the Fall of 1939, when the rains became normal again, and the grofertilegan to become furtile. During the next few years, World War Two began for the United States, and the country was pulled out of the Depression and the plaifertile again become furtile and productive to the United States.
