It's some boyzone song. I cannot believe I went through it, I cannot believe my friend persuaded me to go through with it. Now I am waiting for my friend to call back to see if we got in. I hope not.. because I am not so sure about singing in front oh the entire school anyway. Physics test today and I hope I pass. Came back and my whole family went to Johor without me. Actually I didn't mind.. I am sick of going there anyway. I'd rather be out at the shopping malls of Singapore.
