It's not a direct quote, but she said that people worrying about her was driving her mad. Which is very true, isn't it? It's nice for some people close to you to ask if you're OK but if someone you've met like once is worried about you... and then EVERYONE is worried about you... It's very daunting and if you're not OK it's not a position you like to be in, and if you are you'll soon be not OK because you'll become royally pissed off.  In Senior Drama Group, me and Scott are doing a double-act as Soldier 1 and Soldier 2 ^O^. We do it really well, too. Well, I suppose that's because we're brilliant ^O^.  Anyway, I can't think of anything else other than Scott liking the blog. Heh, I'll see if I can win some awards.  Love, Jon Roskilly
