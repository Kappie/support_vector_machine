As a Christian, and as a humanist-American I must say that the idea makes me sick.  To have people who stand upon their soap boxed preaching at me being so close to making their sermon a matter of law.  It's quite scary.    Today they didn't win.  They got close, but not close enough.  As of now I am not legally bound definitely by the U.S. constitution from being married as others are.  I thank God.  Through these times of trial, I have kept strong in my faith and kept my spirit up through the Blessed Sacrament, and in knowing that Jesus is watching the sparrow, so surely I know he watches me.  As the old spiritual goes: "Why should I feel discouraged?  Why should the shadows come?  Why should my heart feel lonely, and long for heaven and home?  When Jesus is my portion, a constant friend is He.  He's eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches over me."   Every time I get down, or discouraged I must remember that if God be for me, then who can be against me?  In these trials I ask that all of you pray for me, as well as for our enemies - that they might fully know and understand the gospel of Our Savior, Jesus Christ.
