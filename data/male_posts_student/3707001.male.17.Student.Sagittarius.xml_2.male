U listened with kindness and understanding, even when u didnt want to hear it.  U made Bio the last few years so much fun.  I dont remember if i told u this but im sorry bout the DNA project.  Im gonna miss u SOOO much next year, but i know that u'll do my proud.  U said that u were jealous of my smartness, well i was always jealous of everything else u had.  I still dont know what im gonna do next yr, who will i turn to?  well even if i find some1 else to talk to, u can never be replaced. Song the reminds of me U: "Just Friends" - Musiq  To my Mowat ball buddies: J.Koo, Jan, Jason, AP, Kosher, Tino, Jeff, D.Fox, Frany, Simey... Although i usually looked mad while i was playing, i wouldnt have traded it for the world.  Koo, Jan, Jason, u guys are the most hospitable hosts i've ever met.  Thx for all those rides home.  Sorry for all those elbows to the body and for pushing u into stuff AP.  Koo, i still got ur shorts and u got my $10.  All u guys gotta come down to my turf so that i can show u guys so paradice hospitality :D  Holly:  I only decided to go to prom 2 hrs b4 i asked u to it, but im glad that my friends changed my mind.  U were the main reason y i had so much fun. I'm sorry for: being a bad dancer, for not talking, for ruining ur corsage, for leaving u at britts...  Dont ever forget our song!!  To my BASICs:  Thank you everyone at Forward for keeping me straight.  Matt, Ada, Martha, thank you for bugging me to come to church, if it wasnt for u i dont know how i woulda ended up.  Sorry for not coming to church as often as i coulda, but plz dont ever give up on me.  SnoCamp was a blast every year (3on3 champs!!) and so was anything else we did together... Next year I'll be in C, but ima still try to come wit u guys to snocamp, i got a championship to defend!! Although im prolly only third string: if u ever need a friend i'll always be here.  To scott: thx for all those rides to church, u dont know how much they meant to me... one day u can pay me back for the beatings.  To my friday nite chillin crew: Nick, KD, baker:  Friday nites were jokes, even though i was usually the victim of some kinda beating. on ps2, I AM KING OF MVC2 AND CAPCOM VS SNK2!!! But thx for having me even tho i usually had to leave early... :( Thx for making fun of me and changing my msn name to something gay when i left it on!!  Shifat: I wish u were still here man, it just hasnt been the same w/o u.  Thx for keeping my on top of school, I hope we can open a doctor's clinic together or something one day. :) Dont ever lose sight of ur goals cuz u better believe i wont lose sight of mine!  Kendra: spares and Geo this yr were so much more fun.  TY for being such a good friend. (ps. ur still going down) Song that reminds me of U: "4 seasons of lonliness" - BoyzIIMen  Catherine: I know u moved on like 2 yrs ago, but I just thought u should know that i lost countless hrs thinking of what i missed out on.  I've finally moved on too tho, I'll miss ur crazy comments..... Song: "On Bended Knee" - BoyzIIMen  Whew... that was alot to get off my chest!! If i missed ANYone plz just email me and i will throw u in there, but i take a shower and get rdy cuz Martha's bugging me to go to Youth Group (jks)!!  Grads of 2004: I'll miss each and everyone of U!!! -.-
