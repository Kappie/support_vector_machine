Triunfo       Editorial Reviews   urlLink Amazon.com    While North American rap drowns in its own clichés, international artists are invigorating the genre with their own musical traditions. The Orishas, a Cuban group based in France, use Afro-Cuban religion to summon the spirit of hip-hop. Named for gods of Santeria, they came together in 1998 when members Yotuel and Ruzzo hooked up with Roldan and Flaco-Pro (a veteran of Sergeant Garcia) through a cultural exchange program between French and Cuban rappers. Collaborating with French hip-hop producer Miko Niko, they bring the attitude of Havana streets to the rest of the world, appealing to the Buena Vista Social Club crowd as well as the hip-hop heads. On their debut, A lo Cubano, the song "537 C.U.B.A." (their remake of Compay Segundo's "Chan Chan") gives new meaning to the term "old school." And the sound of sacred Santeria beats and traditional son weaving through sharp-edged lyrical attacks with groove-heavy bass and drum tracks on tunes like "Represent," "Atención," and "Atrevido" make for a cool joyride through the back streets of Havana. --Jesse "Chuy" Varela
