A lot.  And he didn't use his voice properly so he sounded like a louder whinier michael.  However, he had some interesting things to say, and to be fair, it was all true, but its point of view, you know? the way they interpret things, its different.  more on that on the lobby. The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra has to be the best movie. Ever. But don't see it alone, cuz it sucks when you watch it without anyone to make fun of it with.  A horrible experience I had to go through because Michael neglected to tell me of a time change.  But all is well, because Jonah paid for my ticket the second time, and I got to punch Michael in the stomach.  Why shake hands when we can touch other things?
