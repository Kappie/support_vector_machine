I played Warcraft 3 for a little while and then went to BJ's. We played some games there, wrestling, sould calibor, super smash bros. and I attempted to talk to Cookie, but grumpy gus wouldn't let me. Dimitri made some chicken burgers and we ate that, and then I stole a pop from the fridge. BJ got his information from the Art Institute and I just sent my thingy today that asks for information on some classes. Eventually me, BJ, and Dimitri went down to the pool for a couple hours, and it was much much more fun then when we went yesterday. lol.... umm.... saw some hot chicks then we went home. When I got home I had a burger and finished installing World of Warcraft, and started talking to Cookie.  I'm going to be gone from the 6th till around the 29th, BUT DON'T WORRY!!! my dad supposedly bought a brand new fancy computer which means I can still be go on the computer and talk to everyone and play games. I can't wait till I leave because... ummm.... don't know, lol :p...
