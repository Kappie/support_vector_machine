We all (the pajama gang) need to get a picture where we are all in a circle with our heads looking down and the person taking the picture is underneath us. Trust me its the coolest thing. People have done it in poms. and another random thing...... Well, you know how my brother walks funny with his bounce.... well I think its hereditery or whatever its called (in the genes) because I just found out that my Uncle and cousin both walk the same way (with the bounce). Hehe. I just thought that was really funny and that I'd let u all know that. Well there is a Michigan dinner or something in Orlando so maybe we'll see each other there. Who knows??? Love you all bunches.
