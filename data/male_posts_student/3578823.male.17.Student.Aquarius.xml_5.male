And it owns me so much...Enough will the gloating though...  I've been having this problem with a webhosting company named  urlLink FuitadNET . I bought a small $5 package from them May 25th 2004, and I think I gave them the wrong DomainEPP(whatever the heck that is), so the original domain I wanted to use(infinigeeks.org) couldn't be used. Then I 'forgot' my password to the billing area thing, and I had to get LiveHelp with that, and that took half an hour to get the password restored. So instead, I queried them for about a week seeing if they could help. Well, I finally gave up because I was getting nowhere with them, so I asked them if I could just order another domain instead; they said it was an extra $2.50(you're ripping me off, but okay, I'll play you're game, it's only $2.50). Well, they set that up FINALLY on Sunday(waited 3 days for them to get around to setting it up). The welcome e-mail said that the domain could take up to 48 hours to become active(okay, I understand that, I'll wait..) Well..that was Sunday...it is now Thursday, 96 hours. I waited until now till I asked them for help again, I thought the problem would solve itself. No. So now, I am trying to get in on livehelp(no luck, they're ALWAYS full, or maybe it's just there for looks), but I just typed up a ticket for them, so that should get them going. HOPEFULLY the problem gets fixed this time and there are no more future problems. If so, I'm packing up and leaving. I may go back to  urlLink Addaction . Either way, it's bed time. Lol. Night.
