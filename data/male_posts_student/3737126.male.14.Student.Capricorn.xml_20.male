It is the era where life is made easier, if not more complicated. It is where people depend on technology, latest gizmos and gadgets and other things Science has to offer. When asked on what things never leave their pockets or bags whenever you go out with friends, classmates, outings, etc, most people would rank their latest cellphone models, palm tops, and MP3 players as an aid in helping them pass by time. When I’m the one asked, my journal and pen never leaves my bag and a tickler and a spare pen to place in my pocket. They would ask me why, and I have a simple answer. I’m a journalist. But wouldn’t it be interesting to know the history behind this reason?  The paper and pencil are two of the products of the progression of human civilization. To date back in history, there were illustrations found in caves, believed to be the work of pre-historic men inscribing what they see during their days. The Sumerians, titled to be the oldest civilization that existed, introduced a formal writing system called Cuneiform. The infamous Ancient Egypt decorated chambers, walls, halls and infrastructures with hieroglyphics, used to narrate about mythology, literature. They also used papyrus, utilized as early paper. The Chinese on the other hand introduced calligraphy. These were the foundation of two of the basic necessities of people of all ages. The rest is history.  As early as the pre-historic era, pre-historic men already took down notes of what happened around them. Putting the things they witnessed into illustrated media. The Bible has eyewitness accounts and stories passed on orally, written down to formalize it. Written accounts during important events that made a mark in history are read in search of more information, referring on what the writer knew, saw, and wrote. Take the Diary of Anne Frank as an example.  The pen is the bullet and the paper is the gun, it aims to shoot information to the readers. With these elements in the hands of a skilled fellow, we can expect exceptional writings from this person. As a young journalist, it is my aim to inform the readers of what I see as how I see it, or of something they knew little of.  The practicality of the trusty pen and notebook arises. Anything you’ve written is written. It is an event, thought, and talent fused to a medium. Writing down events might someday be a basis of the future generation. What happens now will be history in the future.  The center of journalism is life, divided into different branches. From theories and mythology to politics and Popsicle sticks. Compounding my thought in written form is my passion. It has been my friend, my sword and my voice.  We can see that broadcast journalists bring too a notebook and pen to jot down essential information. With this information, they report it to the viewers in another form of media. It is an evolved form of journalism, taking it to another level. Keeping it in my dreams, and having my pen and notebook in my pocket and knapsack will surely help. So as you pack your things for an exciting day ahead, together with family, friends, or even just alone, what item never leaves you?
