    
       Last night's match at the Telstra Dome between Collingwood and the Western Bulldogs has displayed the urgency to see if the playing surface is safe to play on.  There were uncountable mistakes in the last 2 nights' action from the "Dome", a majority of players slipping over.  A player has had his season ended as he did his knee, slipping over, on the boundary line. The AFLPA must not take this lying down. Testra Dome's surface is deteriorating AGAIN and should not be tolerated.
