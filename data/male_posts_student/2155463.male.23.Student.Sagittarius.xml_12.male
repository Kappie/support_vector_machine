Maybe it's just natural for all of us, but I have an insatiable need to feel needed, to feel depended upon, to feel appreciated.  I think that this is one of the reasons that I love helping people so much, just for that feeling.  And also one of the reasons that I love playing on sports teams - I love competition, but there is just an element of absolute interdependence inherent in playing on a team that I really feel a need for.  Perhaps my biggest problem is that I don't know how to act when the problem is over.  It seems like I always just end up going back to being a nobody when the pressure's off or when the problem's resolved, and this makes me feel just as unappreciated afterwards as I did appreciated while I was helping.  But I just...I don't know, it just seems like my worldview is so centered around need that I don't know what to do when need is absent, when everything seems fine.  This might sound horrible, but I've honestly thought at times that the best girl for me would be a depressive - not necessarily someone who was manic or anything, but someone who just tended to be more somber.  My (probably skewed) reasoning is that such a person would seemingly have perpetual problems (be it anything from actual "big" problems to just needing cheered up), so I could always feel needed because I could always be helping her.    So maybe this clears up why I'm still single - on the one hand I love helping people, but on the other I know that I am person that needs to be perpetually needed.  Thus, in some strange way me liking a girl probably means that having a relationship with her would be bad for her because I have a need for her to be needy...  Ok, that is just so screwed up I can't even believe I actually feel that way...
