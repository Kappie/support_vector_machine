Went home to freshen up b4 going to the birthdae celebration, but decided to go tampines mall with gabriel first. It was a waste of time...ate at macs, two choc sundaes and a ton of other stuff...got sick looking @ two girls eating sundae later on, and all the macs that popped up everywhere, they seem to be there all the time...went back to marine parade to pick up birthdae cake 4 cousin. Damn tired, but onli around 3, going to stay to twelve midnight...  later on ate steamboat and picked up birthdae cake 4 cheryl (gabe's sis) her 21st birthdae on 16th. Everyone else was busy eating so i had to go...both cakes were choc...got thorougly sick of choc...nothing much later on, counted down to gabes actual bdae at twelve...got home at one exhausted.  Don't feel too good...too much sugar perhaps...and bushed. Ugh...
