We do not know those rules, but you do. Please respect them. Abide by all of Bob and Kathy's rules, as well as the spirit of our rules.     1. Don't forget about your family. Please don't make all kinds of plans which take you away from us all weekend long. We like having you around. We like to see you. Check in with us and our plans and continue to be a part of them. 2. Don't forget about your friends. Continue to include them with your activities with Donnie. 3. Don't forget about your schoolwork. It is still important that you get your schoolwork done and do the best that you can. 4. It is OK to show affection, but don't let him put his hands all over you in public, and epecially around Mom and Dad. Likewise, don't let him drape himself all over you....I call it a strangle hug. These activities show nothing but immaturity. 5. Weeknights-home by 10:00; Donnie is out the door at 10:00. 6. Weekends- home by 12:00; Donnie is out the door at 12:00. This time is negotiable but if you know of an event that will take you out past this time, please discuss it with us beforehand. If we get a call at 11:30 asking to stay out later, we will consider it, but will be less comfortable granting it. 7. Let us know where you are and who you are with. 8. No "cruising" around in Donnie's car looking for activities. 9. When you are home with Donnie in your room, leave your door open at least a foot. This shows us that we are welcome to come in. 10. When you are downstairs with Donnie watching a movie, leave the door open at least a foot. This shows us that we are welcome to come in. 11. If you are doing something in which we are not welcome to come in, please reconsider what you are doing. 12. Do have Donnie come over to our house. The more we see him, the more comfortable we will become with him and your relationship. 13. Do join us in our conversations. The more we chat with him, the more comfortable we will become with him and your relationship. 14. Do invite him over for dinner at any time. Just let us know so we have enough foor for him. 15. Do ask us if you can invite him to some of the family things we may be doing. We may not always say yes, but we would like to include him if possible and appropriate. 16. Hugging is allowed. Kissing is allowed. Absolutely, positively no sexual intercourse is allowed. There are many reasons for this. 17. What happens in between those two extremes is your choice.....and we wouldn't know anyway. Just be aware that physical contact between two people is very powerful and can cause problems as well as pleasures. (Does he like me just because I "produce" for him; if I don't "produce" will he drop me; do I withhold as punishment; what do I do if he wants it and I do not.) Please use good judgement on this.
