Math'd: He finally put the assignment up before the end of class so I finished it before he had even started talking about it. Actually, it was funny, I put down my pencil just as a random bell rang. It wasn't supposed to ring, but it did anyways.  English'd: Since the whole class finished "The Crucible" he let us watch a movie. Let us is the wrong word. Had us watch one. I didn't actually want to watch it. We watched Sleepy Hollow. I do not like that movie, to gory. I could be wrong, but I think it was rated "R". I tried to sleep, but I couldn't, so I finished writing the note to Dominique that I started in Math'd.  Lunch'd: I was so bored! My friends still talk about video games exclusively (meaning that's all they talk about). I am really tired of that. It is all they care about, and believe it or not, it's not all I care about. I am tired of hearing people so shocked because I don't base my whole life around video games like it may seem like I do.  Free Period'd: I went over to Granada but I left campus early so I was there like 10 minutes before their lunch started. I got homecoming pictures and I plan on scanning one tomorrow in web-page.  Biology'd: I was so tired that I fell asleep. The teacher was nice enough to wake me up discreetly, unlike what I have heard about at Granada. I had forewarned her that I was tired though.  Well, exciting day huh? I know, I need a better life, if you find one, please donate it to the "Get a Life for Colin" fund. Checks, Mastercard, Visa and American Express are accepted.
