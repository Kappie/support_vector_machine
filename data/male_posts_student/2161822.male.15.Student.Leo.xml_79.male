Getting disconnected from AIM by an "unknown" error every half hour. I hate AOL. You also gotta love kids who invite themselves into something they're not wanted in and then complain when they are told about it. And I should grow up. Give me a break. But whatever. I'm done for today. 'Cause I had nothing really to say, but then again I have nothing good to say anyday. Whatever. Keep on reading my boring crap kids! And remember... Listen to H.I.M.
