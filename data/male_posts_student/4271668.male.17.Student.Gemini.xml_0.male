Last night I had a dream that I could remember which is quite a feet for me. It was about an older me on a realy realy fast train with a very attractive blonde sitting next to me very scared. She eventualy falls asleep on me and that's when I wake up. I'm not so sure why I'm writing my dreams down now but like I said dreams that I can remember don't happen very often. I also start going back into school today. I'm meeting with a few teachers and my councelor. I have been veging almost all summer and I am ready to get back to school. Well I beter get going I don't have much time before I have to leave. Well bye for now.
