Therefore, I have only seen a few greats in my day. I haven't been watching wrestling very long either. Maybe only about 5-6 years.   #1--"The Heart Break Kid" Shawn Michaels--  This guy was the whole reason that I began to watch wrestling in the first place. I flipped on the TV and saw someone superkick the Undertaker, put him into a body bag. Prance around like he was the biggest of all the big-shots and then do some really neat poses with some cool fireworks. I loved everything about HBK. The nickname, how the ladies loved him, how athletic he was, etc. etc.   #2--Mick Foley (aka Dude Love, Cactus Jack, and Mankind)--  Is there anything really special about how this guy taunts?  Nope.  Okay how about his awesome physique?  What physique??  Hmmm. How about his ravishingly good looks?  Uh...no!  So what makes this guy so special??? The fact that he spent his whole life trying to get into the Fed. He wrestled in High School gyms to start his carreer. After he got better, he went to Japan and wrestled. In Japan he had his whole body torn apart. But he kept going til he made it ECW, then WCW and then finally to the Fed. When he won the title I went nuts. I went to school the next day the BIGGEST Foley fan ever. I have both of his autobios and his new book Tietam Brown. This guy is the best!   #3--The Rock (Rockey Miavia)--  What can I say about the Rock? This man, next to Hulk Hogan, has had one of the best carreers in the history of the business. When you were supposed to hate him...you still liked him. Then when you were supposed to like him...you loved him. He was the first 3rd generation "superstar" on the Fed's roster. And what a stud he is.   #4--Bret "Hit Man" Hart--  I didn't quite start watching wrestling in time to see Bret in the Fed. I tuned in just as he was leaving. And what a shame it was. I have seen about 50% of the matches Bret has been in and they are classics. The very first Iron Man Match. The first Ladder Match. He was a tag champ, IC champ, and a world champ...and thats just the WWF/E! His feuds with his brother and with Austin were among the top 10 feuds in the history of WWF/E.   #5--Owen Hart (RIP)--   What was so great about Owen Hart?  Well...hmm...lets see here. There wasn't a whole lot that was too great about his wresting style, or his out of ring abilities, or how well he could handle the stick (microphone); but the way that these not so great attributes meshed together made an excellent entertainer. He also had a bad gimmick as the Blue Blazer, which eventually led to his death, but despite that he made it work. Just for the record, from what was said on the special Raw episode dedicated to Owen, I take it he was quite the ribber and quite the family man. I really would have been honored to shake his hand, or just to even see him live.   #6--nWo--  Hmmm...can I do that? Can I just make the collective unit there one of the Hall of Famers?... Well...Im pretty sure that  I JUST DID!  These guys were studs. And Im not talking about Vince's lame redition of the nWo. Im talking about nWo Black and White (Hogan, Nash, and Hall). These guys could really raise some hell in WCW. They kicked ass and took names day in and day out! I didn't really quite understand the nWo Black and White vs. nWo Wolfpack, but that is probably just because I didn't watch WCW all that often.   Noteables  Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Triple H, and definately Steve Austin!  How is that Drew? Something about this last couple of years opted me to bump Triple H off of my list. I really think that if I took this last 8 months away he would be right up with HBK and the Rock. He was one of my favorite wrestlers...but now what can I say? He is getting a little selfing with the strap.I say you whip out your best Tag Teams of all time...   LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment
