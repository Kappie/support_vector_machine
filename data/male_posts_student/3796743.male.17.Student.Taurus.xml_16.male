Today I slept in really super late, went to the hospital for a few hours to volunteer (which I haven't done in forever!) and then met AG downtown for about an hour. That was my day, and it was royally boring. Tomorrow I have to wake up at the insane hour of 10.00 AM and drive down to Portland to go take my grandparents to the airport. I'll probably go shopping too! No sales tax yo! Then I'm going to Jane Eyre (sp?), its a play, with Emmy. So that will be fun. Um....yep. OoO...I forgot to share. Emmy and I booked our plane tickets to San Francisco. We are going at the end of this month which is like a little over two weeks away. I'm excited. It'll be fun. I never thought my mom would let me go because you know...I'm traveling with two girls throughout a random city for a week! Yep she let me stay for a week! Not to mention the guy we are staying with is a drag queen. I didn't tell her I was stayin with a gay guy tho...she might flip. I cannot wait. Well, that's all I've got for you today! Okay, so this little thing at the bottom of this entry I found kinda funny...so I'll share it with you... thats it...Later all....  "I'm tired of all this nonsense about beauty being only skin-deep. That's deep enough. What do you want, an adorable pancreas?"  Talk to y'all tomorrow!
