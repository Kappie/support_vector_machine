I wonder why i stopped doing that? oh, yeah...concern for others. meh. who needs that, hehe. it got pretty brutal when harry gave thomas a shot to the cojones and then he went into a blood frenzy. actually the latter was pretty cool, in a horror movie kind of way.  my father has somehow convinced me to do research for him online. he should pay me. but why should he? all the local businesses have already determined i am not worth paying. damn, well, candar out.
