Well until I get a digital camera but that shouldn't be long.  Anyway a bit about me I am a male student from England just about to start my G.C.S.E's (so I suppose in a perfect world I should be revising instead of doing this but still this ain't a perfect world now is it...)I am into rock music and anything that the radio decides to churn out, if I think there is anymore information needing adding about me I will add it.  I hope to add at least one post a day or if I have the time I will add more but we will see.   Current mood:  Chilled Current music: Coldplay
