If I misspell stuff, it's because I can't see because I'm not wearing my glasses, so you are forewarned.  Or maybe I'm just too lazy to press backspace.  Anyways...don'e really know what I was going to say now that I've gotten this far.    Michael, you are the funniest person on this blog.  I really enjoy your posts.  Haha!  ::insert witty signature here::
