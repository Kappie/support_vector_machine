WRONG!! first, the top flies off, and the shake splashes all over my face, clothes, kitchen..and worst of all, MY HAIR!! AHHH!! (LoL) so, i try to make another one, thinking it can't happen twice! well, i was right- it didn't happen again- this time, i tried to stop the rubbery-spinny thing with my middle finger, and it sliced it open...this was the shake/blender incident from HELL!!! i've sworn to never make a shake again. am i right? i dont really feel like getting attacked by the blender again! i'll try and post things occasionally (like every day), but Nicole, you have to make me do it, k? we'll make each other post, cool!! kk? awesome..so, bye!  (P.S. Nicole, you're such a "G") hahahah
