I met a lot of great people, some of which I got closer with than others :-)   But anyway... beach, volleyball, poker, movies, ice cream, jet skiing, and tubing was just a taste of what we did. I was supposed to stay up another 4 days but I really wanted to come back and hang out with some people. My senior pictures were also supposed to be taken up there but there wasn't time so, hopefully, I'll be able to go back and get them taken.
