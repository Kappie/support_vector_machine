Anyway.... tomoro going for op... its a small no big deal actually but then.... its my 2nd operation in my entire life!!!   Im listening to Vernetta Lopez Lunch break on Class 95... Songs are cool and overwhelming too...   It was a nice morning... was doing the dishes... chatting with my pals on MSN, and i put the radio on blast.... woke my cats up for breakfast and was ready to do housework... when Vernetta said... " NExt on Number 3".... then it is it!!! That was it... total spoiler and ruin everything!!!!! *sob* *sob*    And then it came.... " Make a wish... I can dream" ....       Actually Im very pissed with Arse yesterday night. He wanted a job in the health sector.. and i tried my bloody very best to get the no for him AS A FAVOUR OF A FRIEND.... but then he didnt get back to me.... and when i ask he said he lost the number and ask me to give the number again.... BULL SHIT...... i made an effort and he took it for granted... rest assured..... good luck pal....      Like the malays would say... " nak kena trembak dengan senapang gajah".
