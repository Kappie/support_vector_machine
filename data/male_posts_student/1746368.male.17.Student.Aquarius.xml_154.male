We had youth group and all the fun stuff that comes with it.  I led the crowdbreaker tonight because Dave was gone. (for more information on Dave, see lefthand side bar underneath "People") It went alright, but people kept trying to cheat so it was kind of frustrating.  School today was school today. I have to go into US History early tomorrow and make up a test, but I will try and post at lunch because I'm just like that.
