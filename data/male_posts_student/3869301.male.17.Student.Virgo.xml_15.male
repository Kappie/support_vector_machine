We had a good time, but a little Wheeler goes a long way. A long road trip with the Wheelers goes a very long way.  Tomorrow I am going to have breakfast with k-ray. I have not seen her since May when we graduated. I have always had a crush on her and will forever have one on her. Unfufilled love... the product of a youth in which I did not understand why no one thought I was cool.
