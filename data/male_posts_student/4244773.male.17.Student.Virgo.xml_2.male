But maybe it's gonna change soon as the track games has started and America looks strong in Sprinting and Hurdles while China only hopes on the Hammer Throwing event only. Only few more days left and the Olympics will end, we'll have to wait for another 4 more years for the next Olympics in i also don't know where but i know that i'm gonna love it !!!
