"to the world, u might be someone but to someone, u might be the world". guess no one will understand wat i have done. i even ask her fren to ask her out on special days as i know she really wish to celeb with her close frens but i do not want them to tell her tat i am the one who said tat. but.....some told her n she ask me not to do tat again in a polite way. one might think i'm doing so to get her but i didnt, i just wan her to be happy and if she does accept me, i wan her to accept me for who i am, not because of wat i did and wat i have. but not only tat they told her but even said tat i am annoying, i admit tat i am but i don mind, as long as they did wat i ask them to. there is nothing better than seeing the one u care, smiles.  continues...........
