Victor has been evicted from Big Brother. Victor acted like a bit of a cunt, constantly trying to wind people up with his  braggadocio  and  machismo  attitude. And he didn't think he would leave! He's not a real gangster or Yardie anyway, just a jumped up twat. I think Dan will win, maybe Stuart. I like Stuart's attitude, doesn't get involved in anything, just sits there and soaks it up and gets laid.      I have just seen Spiderman 2 with Marcus and Mark, it was very good. Good acting, particularly from Alfred Molina playing the villain, and obviously nice to see Kirsten Dunst. They've left it open for a 3rd film, which I believe they're making right now. Went to Woking to see it, and then went in McDonalds afterwards. It was alright until about 20 chavs came in and made it ChavDonalds. Also there was a poster in there asking for new staff, offering 'a good wage'. Yes, at Â£4.25 a fucking hour! Hi-larious. We decided to make a quick exit, and got back to the delights of Ash Vale and Heath End respectively.      Thinking of chavs...  urlLink http://www.chavscum.co.uk     urlLink http://www.chavtowns.com       Great websites.      Ooh my holiday's in 8 days, which is cool. Had a look at the map today and looked at the mountains. Scarily massive, there were even permanent glaciers, where the snow never melts and it's perma-ice. There's a road right the way up one of the mountains, which is 1565m tall, way higher than Ben Nevis. There's some mountains which are getting on for 3500m (10500ft). Looks wicked. Hopefully, the surf's up again, like the storm last year when they had the 15ft waves.      Still thinking of X. I really should e-mail her and tell her my feelings. As they said in Spiderman, 'if you keep love inside you, it's going to make you sick'.      Signing off,   THOM
