I haven't blogged for awhile, and I see we're still on GM.. From what I'm reading, its a touchy subject. personally, i agree with Rob.. I'm uncomfortable seeing it, but its not immoral. Yesterday, I saw a truck with a sticker that had this: Marriage = Man + Woman for a moment, i considered hitting him... but i enjoy driving, and if i hit someone, i will not be driving. People are quoting the Bible and such, but when it comes down to it, I believe that the big stink about GM is that most people are uncomfortable with the thought of GM, so they get other people riled up about it, and now its a hot subject. There's my two cents, and its time for a new subject to talk about...  uhh... hmm.... erm... why did the chicken cross the road? there's a website with how other people would answer: www.chickenjoke.com there. Laughter is the bestest medicine, so laugh it up!
