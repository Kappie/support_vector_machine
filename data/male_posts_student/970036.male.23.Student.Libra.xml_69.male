I've got a take-home final exam due Friday evening at 18:00, and an in-class final Friday morning at 08:00. The sheer amount of time compartmentalization I'll be pulling off over the next 48 hours will be astounding:  Wednesday 21:00 to 21:05 - receive take-home final exam 22:00 to ??:?? - start working on take-home final  Thursday ??:?? to ??:?? - sleep for a few hours ??:?? to 14:00 - study for in-class final 15:00 to 22:00 - work 23:00 to ??:?? - sleep for a few hours  Friday ??:?? to 07:00 - study for in-class final 08:00 to 10:00 - write in-class final 11:00 to 14:00 - finish/touch up take home final 15:00 to 22:00 - work  Things get a bit more ugly if I try to juggle my work schedule. If I cancel my Thursday shift to study, then I need to work my Friday shift, meaning I won't have Friday afternoon to touch up my take-home final, and I'll have to hand it in almost 5 hours before the 18:00 due time. If I work on Thursday it gives me less time to study for my in-class final but more time on Friday to work on my take-home final...  ...bah! This is  hurting my brain  already! I shouldn't be wasting my precious time doing this blog anyways! I'd better get cracking!   Currently listening to: Own heart palpitations during this time of perpetual, adrenaline-fuelled stress.
