I felt like I wanted to disappear for a while but now I can see it is just a matter of learning from it. Yes, learn from your mistakes. Like telling a paraplegic what a great lesson he learned…my head is wedged between the slats of the headboard and I feel like I wish I were some place else. I blew off 2 people to be alone with it tonight. I didn’t want to break down in front of anyone. This is not comfortable. No but I did all the silly little things. Hi how are you, how was your weekend, hot one isn’t it. No they are not questions. Fine good you how are you doing. It cheapens it, so when you need it becomes meaningless. No that is not where I am ending it. When I am confident I tend to self-prophesize. I can't wait to take phych. Come on something positive? Told the truth and took the heat for my mistake. Caught whats her name checking me out in class. Almost acted like a normal person all day.
