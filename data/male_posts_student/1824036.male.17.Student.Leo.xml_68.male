They all think that they are pretty bad news bears, but in all actuality they SUCK! At the end of the half its like 14-0 and we are behind and getting our butts chewed out. Late in the game we made a surge to tie it at 20 points all, with about 1:30 to go, but our plans backfired as an interception spelled definate doom.  Me personally, I didn't do too bad. But there is always room for improvement. My blocking could have been quite a bit better, I probably should have had about 3 or 4 missed tackles, etc. etc. There are also some people on my team that I dont think are giving it their 100%. And one is probably...no no no...the one person that I am aiming at is BRYAN GOTTULA...but what do I know...I only play football with all of my heart and all of my soul trying to do my personal best on every down of every game...I mean its not like I can slack off or anything....like some people...  Chew on that for a while!!!
