All of Wendesday and Thursday, my mind as been in one single fucking place. The Move. I have been saturating myself with preperations. I'm not even sure if it will be worthwhile in the long-run. I do this to myself all the time, with out a break.   I've been looking into colleges, apartments, and jobs, jobs, jobs. Right now, I am looking for something during the night hours. If I can pull that off, I might start back to school earlier than I am planning to. We will see - I'm super stoked thought. At the same time, a lot of scared.  I'm starting all over while, at the same time, alot of my friends are starting out brand new, and some are moving up in what they love. Me - I'm starting over from the start - that's fine. I got lots of time I guess. Might as well be busting my ass during that time. The other option would be to make and spend money. Seems worthless and unrewarding but I guess I would have STUFF! Fuck that.  I have a long list of goals. Longer than santa's list, i'm sure.   current mood:  anxious current music: face to face
