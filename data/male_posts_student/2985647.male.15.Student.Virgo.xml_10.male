In fact, the most exciting thing I did today was watching fat kids doing PE in 5th period. The thing which really made me happy was the fact I saw 2 of them stack! I handed in my money for the Stamford Brigde trip, so thats something to look foward to, especially if I see the barstool formally known as Scott Parker, to give him a piece of my mind.   Anyway, random joke time:   A young camel was bored one day and started asking his mother questions.  "Why do we have large three toed feet?"  "So we don't sink while walking in the soft sands of the desert," his mother replied.  "Why do we have long eyelashes?" was the next question.  To stop the sand of the desert storms getting in our eyes," was the exasperated reply.  Why do we have a large hump on our back?"  So we can cross the many miles of desert without needing water," his mother snapped.  So what the fuck are we doing in Chester zoo?"
