Today was pretty cool, I got to go to andrew's party with ira which was pretty fun, a bit awkward at times around steph, and a bit boring in the beginning. After that we went to ira's where I actually learned how to stand on a skateboard, note I still suck ass but I got better. Oh and if you're this far into reading the Say It Ain't So midi has started, please don't hate it's a keyboard portrayal of the song I think it's pretty good for having none of the actual instruments. Anyways I can skate down a portion of ira's walkway and I can stay on, start off, and finish alright with the minor mistakes such as fucking up a stop and basically landing on my foot backwards my left knee hurts a bit right now but w/e I'll get over it. It's 2:30 so I'm going to bed or something, later to all my readers (like 2 or 3 tops).  Edit: I changed the song to the zephyr song because it's alot more depressed then the midi version of say it ain't so and depressed is my mood of choice of the current time. P.S. Lyric of the Moment: Letting out the noise inside of me (Letting out the noise inside of me)Every window pane is shattering (Every window pane is shattering)Cutting up my words before I speak (Cutting up my words) This is how it feels to not believe Way away away from here I'll be Way away away so you can see How it feels to be alone and not believe (feels to be alone and not believe)Feels to be alone and not believe anything. Band: Yellowcard Song: Way Away.
