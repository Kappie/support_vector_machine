Who's house?  Emily's or Tori's???  Well the one thing I know is that it won't be at my house on account of the fact that if anybody wanted to swim... it would be in my bathtub.  Well best of luck to whoever figures this out.  I will come though... where ever and whenever it may be.  So that is all for now. Cheerio,  Kelsey
