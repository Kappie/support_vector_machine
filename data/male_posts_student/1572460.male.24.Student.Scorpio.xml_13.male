If I am asked to preview the United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis next Sunday in less than 10 words, then I won't hesitate even a second to pick Jonathan's statement. It aptly sums up the whole situation leading up to the race at Indy. Now, any F1 fanatic will know that it wouldn't be a great idea to start an argument with Mr. Legard on his statement; those who wish to, can do so at their own peril. For those who aren't sure, the problem is not about arguing with Mr. Legard, the problem IS (and perhaps HAS always been) Michael Schumacher - the 5 time world champion, gunning for his 6th crown, and to me, quite easily, the greatest human being to have got his act behind the wheel of a Formula One Car, so very right!   What more can I say about this guy...I have been watching him race since the last 11 years, seen each and every pit stop and passing manoeuvre he has made, right from his Benetton Renault days. Alas, after I came to the US in 2001, F1 has been limited more to reading and following on the WWW, rather than spending a Sunday afternoon/evening watching 22 drivers hitting the tarmac (whoa!). Watching a race from the stands and being close to the deafening but equally beautiful sound of the 19,000 rpm engines has been one of my top 5 dreams since I began following the sport in my 7th grade. So hooked was I onto F1 during those days, I spent weekends not only watching the qualifying and race day activities, but I even went to the extent of jotting down excerpts from the live commentary sessions on Star Sports, and systematically archiving all the technicalities and trivias associated with my favorite teams.  If I am excited about going to Indy, its a grossly understated fact. Its an inexplicable feeling. If that itself was not enough, the championship this year has been hotly contested like never before in the last 20 years; I believe, the last time three drivers were gunning for the crown (by the end of the last few races that is), was in 1983. And although the problem is Schuey, all I can hope is that I (or Mr. Legard for that matter), don't get to eat our words after the race on Sunday; the competition is thoroughly intense this time around. Schuey could very well be the 6-time world champion on September 29th, or he could be down and out as far as the race for the championship goes, or we could have another 3-way tussle in the final race at Suzuka, Japan. Almost anything could happen and it depends on how the three drivers score points, and make things easier or worse for each other at Suzuka. For now, the only thing I can do is chew my nails. But let's face the truth, if Shane Warne had literal nightmares about Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar smashing him out of cricket grounds for huge sixes, the cocky Mr. Montoya would be feeling something pretty similar. Mathematics and endless ifs and buts about the race predictions are too simple; the vital element so to speak, in today's racing, is none other than Schumacher and his Ferrari. This man and this car could be ruthlessly reliable on their day, and there have been a lot of "these" days in the last few years, leaving other teams and drivers dumbstruck. I won't get a better opportunity to watch a F1 race. Considering Schuey has hardly disappointed his fans in the last 4 years, I can quite proudly say that there's a high probability of me getting to see HISTORY in the making at Indy. Trivia: Schuey would be the ONLY driver to win 6 crowns after Juan Manuel Fangio, who won 5.  To quote a Navjyot Singh Sidhuism, it will be nothing short of: "Taking the cake with a red cherry on top".  P.S.: Whether or not I get to eat the cake with the cherry (and probably share it with you if you want), the Indy Trip Diary will be posted for sure.
