This is Happy Tree Friends :))), a cartoon series on the web that is all about being brutal, for once. For those of you who hate teddy bears and "cute" little ruber ducks, and like seeing them being chopped up and killed. Haha, I have to admit, it really is relaxing, especially after 6-7 hours of revision.
