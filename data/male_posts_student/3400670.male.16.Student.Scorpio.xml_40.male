Anything by Tom Wolf is great - I am currently rereading some of Halberstom's work on the fifties - he was the historian who did the great Mike Hammer impersonation today.  He is tons of fun to read...he writes pages on Elvis, I Love Lucy and the McDonald's Hamburger chain. I love pop-culture.  As someone asked during class today, Chris Mitchem - why were Americans so scared of communism?  How did this fear start - and how did the Truman and Eisenhower administration handle this fear?  Did the leaders of this time add to the fear and hysteria or attempt to control it? Howard Zinn believes the administrations created this fear to stimulate our economy?  I am not sure I buy his idea...What do you think? Where does Pop-Culture fit into this...Captain America, Mike Hammer - Hollywood was infatuated with the Western at this time? Was Elvis a communist?  James Dean?  Marlon Brando? Lucille Ball had RED hair and married a Cuban????   Blog On... I think this time period could be easily related the roaring twenties...and today - what will this decade be called?
