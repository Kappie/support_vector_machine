Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Slow Motion -Juvenile (feat. Soulja Slim) Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #2 Who would have guessed that 2004’s slickest and most sexually relaxed beat would fall behind Juvenile? Once the rapid fire, Down South go-to man if you were looking to back that azz up, Juve has lost some energy with age and now wants that success all over again, this time in slow motion. It’s not him that makes this track, though, it’s the suave guitar line underneath some echo-effected piano trills, orgasmic horn stabs, and techno bleeps. In complete disagreement with a priceless  50 Cent  lyric, this track’s sensual serenade seems to suggest that Juvenile is no longer into having sex, he’s all about making love.   The Verdict:  7.0/10 - The Fork   (3.5/5)     2004 Wild Card Singles Club Entry
