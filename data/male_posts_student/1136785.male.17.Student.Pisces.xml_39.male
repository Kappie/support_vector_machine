This little corner of the internet has sunk to new lows. I should just use this as a porn link site. I could do some real good. Though I thought that was what the boring yet importants were for. But I haven't done any of those, because even though I'm only in class from 9-12, I feel like I have no time to do anything. I'm always out of time. And I also am really tired of being here.   Oh well, just one more week. One more long, painful, lonely week. But it's not that bad. Grain of salt here people. I'm not in the mood to go into a long introspective rant, but I did find out something about me:   I'm not that conservative, I'm just an asshole! Anyone with stongly held political beliefs that I don't immediately agreewithenrage me. Also, anyone who naturallythinks they're better than others, especially if they support that through the arguement of intelligence upsets megreatly. At lunch I was sitting next to some at heart liberals andsome conservative minded douches. The doucheneverreally said anything but lamentthe problems about beingrepublican in the incredibly liberal north east, and how he always ends up in shoutingmatches with his mother becauses she's a "screaming liberal". Just his ability todismissthe people across withan acceptingknowledge that he's not some mindless republican drone that they must think he is, but an educated young man who is politically astute made me want to shout on why the current administration should be punished for the unwillingness to admit its own deception and mistakes over reasons to invadeIraq, how the new Medicare will end up costing the country just as much as an entrenched Welfare system with little more benefit,how ridiculous social policies are bothfanning the flames ofreligious political war that shouldn't exist andin the long run hurting the economyand that merely pointing out Kerry's flaws is just a paper tiger of an arguement that fails to justify anything. Of course I realized that's entirely hypocritical of me, as I can be accused of the same thing. Thus, me=asshole! It's all so simple now. I can still be a Friedman Democrat on some levels! Also, the asshat insulted McCain. No one gets away with that. And what kind of excuse is "he's slippery"? Because he doesn't follow party line like a monkey? Sheesh.   But I did go on an Amistad cruise. I love the ocean, and I love ships. It's just so peaceful and exciting all at once. It wasn't the real amistad of course, but built in the spitting image.    urlLink Creepy .   urlLink Insane/Stupid.
