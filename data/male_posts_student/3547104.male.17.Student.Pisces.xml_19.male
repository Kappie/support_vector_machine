Took a shower and wat not, had a friend come over to "keep me company"... JB came over (we watched the lovely Beyonce on TV and assessed individuals based on ASSets), the oh so lovely Sophia came to pick me up so that we could venture on to Barnes and Noble. We roamed (I ate like ten pounds of sugar... and we realized we both know the same Shakkira [AAHHHHHHH!])... Sophia needed a cigarette, so after lighting one, she decided to ask some scary punk guy for a lighter (he was nice enough to lend her one) and she smoked her stoge (ABBY AND VAL!) and we went back in. I ended up buying Jewel's book of poems (which is actually very good) and 4 Blondes (think Sex and the City, but 4 completely different stories in one book). Now I'm home eating cookies and gettin fatt. Ugh.      stop all the world now
