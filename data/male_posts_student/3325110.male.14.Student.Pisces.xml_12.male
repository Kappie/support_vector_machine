Peige was a bossy wimp, Nick was hyper, Amanda was great and went on the roller coasters with me. It was all Peige's fault. If it wasn't for peige, I wouldn't be sitting on a towel as I type this. Peige is evil. It was unroomy the second time at the covered wagon ride that I don't remember the name of. Peige talked bad about me. There was also a great war on where we all were after a while. We finally met on the Ski lift thingy. It was odd. Today has been strange. But fortunately, I had Mandolin to burst out laughing randomly with me.
