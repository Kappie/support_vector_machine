It was about some music site that ya'll should go check out if you haven't so you can bitch about its content when you start reading it everyday.  So, I was talking to a coworker about cheese on Monday, and I was shocked to learn that he thought Velveeta was cheese. He also assumed American Cheese was cheese. People nowadays, I tells ya. I had to give him a five minute discourse on why a "pasteurized cheese product" is not cheese, and furthermore, why any cheese made at a factory that employs more than 30-40 people is also likely not cheese.  While cheese by name, store brand cheese (such as colby and "medium" cheddar) tastes like nothing. I grew up in the middle of dairy country, and was appalled when I moved to a big city at the blandness of the cheese. You could go to the store and buy me a pound of store-brand colby, a pound of store-brand cheddar, and a pound of store-brand monterey jack, bring it to me, and I'd throw it at your face. And knock you over. And spit on you. And call your grandma the town whore. I'd then pick it up (the cheese), eat it, and not be able to tell which was which. That stuff tastes like nothing.  Real cheddar cheese is: a)aged for at least one year, preferably 3 or more years b)not "mushy" - you shouldn't be able to bend it like dough c)not easily cut - it could break off into chunks and crumble when cut with a dull blade d)dark yellow, not light yellow e)slightly bitter and full of richness, not... bland and textureless  If you've been eating flavorless cheese all your life, do something about it. It's not too late for your. Do yourself a favor (I can only speak for the USA about this one) - go to a local cheese store or specialty food store. Buy yourself one pound of cheddar cheese that has been aged for 1-2 years. Ween yourself in on this stuff. After you've absorbed that, go and buy something a little older, like 3-4 year old cheddar. If you enjoy this, you'll never go back to store-brand feux-cheese.  After you've eaten the cheddar, try some new cheeses. Try some "salad" cheeses like feta, gorgonzola, or bleu. Try some of the more bitter cheeses like muenster or limberger. Finally, reward yourself with some brie or some asiago.  You'll be a better person for it, and you'll gain that weight you always wanted to.  Cheers.
