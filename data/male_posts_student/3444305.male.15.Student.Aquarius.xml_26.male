And if it's not up for awhile. You can blame the people who have no lives and posted over 400 comments in less than one hour. Yeah, that have no life. Oh well. Well I didn't write yesterday, which was Wendsday if you're just clueless. So what did I do yesterday? Well I got up, which sucked, because I didn't fall to sleep well at all, I got 4 hours of sleep at the most. So yah, that really sucked as you can imagine. And then I went to APS, APS isn't that bad actually. I really like Mr. Reem, he is really cool, which makes the class actually okay. But we had homework to draw maps, we were suppose to have a lot more, but he cut it down a lot which was really cool of him. After that, me and Ryn walked home, and I really did nothing after that. I just hung out at home, and then KLT called me and asked if I wanted to go to hollands with her and Haley. So I went up there and we stayed there for awhile. Then we walked to KLT's and we played with Amandakins, that's KLT's name for her baby sister Amanda. You are wierd KLT. But then, we had to get a chair and clean it, because that was KLT's present to her dad for fathers day. She bought him a chair, so we had to get it out. Haley got out of it lol, not fair. But then we got it out, and she vacummed it and then we went inside for awhile. And then I rode home. My parents made nachoes for dinner, yummy! After that, I finished my APS, and just listend to music. And then Natelie called me and told me to go outside. So I did, and Amanda, the coolest person in the world!! came over! We talked for awhile. And then she had to go home. But it was awesome. After that, I went back inside and watched Summerland because I taped it from Tuesday. Man you got to love that show. But it's not as good as One Tree Hill, man I can't wait for the fall when that comes back on. Haley off that show, man, you can just look at my buddy icon to see what I mean. After that I just talked online, and then I went and washed my face and brushed my teeth and did all that. Then I watched some of Jay Leno, animals were on. And I really like animals so that was cool. Then I went to bed. And now on to today. Today I woke up at the normal early time of 6:15, then I got ready and headed off to school. Today in APS we took our notes and reviewed for the test. We also got split up into politcal parties for an activity we're gonna do. Well the irony about it, me and Ryn were Republicans. Well both of us are strongly democrats. So yeah, it sucks for us lol. We have to fight for laws in this activity we don't even agree with. But I guess that's the point of this activity. It should be interesting however. We have a test tomorrow, I have never took a test with Mr. Reem. So I don't know how it will be, I'm gonna study, but hopefully it's easy. Because studying in the summer does not look fun. So hopefully it's easy. After school, my mom came and picked me up and I just came home. Then after awhile, Andrew asked me if I wanted to come over, so I went over there. He played some mad guitar, man I wish I could do that :-/ oh well. Maybe some day! But then after that, we went to Mcdonalds which was good. Taylor, we saw your brother there, he was all alone though, so me and Andrew were going to be his friends for a little lol. After going to Mcdonalds, we rode back to his house and played Tony Halk for about 10 minutes. And then we walked up to the high school because he had leadership, which I couldn't do sadly, but oh well! So after that, I wanted something to drink so I road to CVS and bought an apple juice and then rode home. Now I'm at home and I have nothing to do. I'm just talking online. Well I'll find something. Well, see-ya!
