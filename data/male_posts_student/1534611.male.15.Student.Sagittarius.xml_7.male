I really wish blogger used friend lists such as LiveJournal and Xanga. However, after playing arround with livejournal for a good 30 minutes I quickly learned blogger's service is alot more capable and meets my needs.  Using a "blogspot.com" journal, my blog doesn't get much attention, but the friend lists in LiveJournal helps people keep updated, so since noone is being updated on my updates (whoa) noone reads anything here. I really dislike how blogger hasn't set up any "blogger community" options, but I am sure they will do it soon.  I wanna switch to LiveJournal for the community, however Blogger has some options that are of a valuable asset to me.  1.Fully customizable layouts (Yea I should be updating the layout soon) 2.Free image host, and it's great! 3.My google toolbar has a little button that allows me to write things down quick.  These are some great services that are brought to me by Blogger, but for god sakes, GET A COMMUNITY GOING! I wanna be able to interact more with other 'bloggers' and have my webblog open for people all the time. I didn't start posting stuff on the internet so noone reads it, theres a purpose to it.  I'd mention Xanga, but xanga just sucks in my opinion. So theres my rant, and blogger it is.   IN OTHER NEWS!  Today I officially finished watching Lilo and Stitch for the 3rd time, such a great movie, and I always laugh really hard at the part where Stitch yells "Happy Hanukah!"... what a character   And speaking about illegally downloading movies, I'm having great difficulties tracking down Requiem for a Dream, whenever I start downloading, the file ends up either corrupted or the download gets canceled, grrr... I'll just have to watch it at some friends house.  Last few days I haven't done anything special, trying to find a good .ca domain and a good host for the cheapest price (please comment if you know one) for my parents cosmetic company thing. I'm glad I get a new opportunity to do some web designing again, it excites me! and except for that the only thing I've been doing is talking to people on MSN (Maggie mostly).  Daina's still in Scotland, I'm sure she's having a good time checking out the hot accented scottish guy goth metal fingers which rip out their eyes with claws, come on, we all know its a huge turn on for the Dane. And speaking about vacations, Sebastian is going to spain on Monday, and I have to take care of his dog for 3 weeks... and this dog, is also the size of my dog... a fucking cow! I can barely handle my dog when it see's a squirrel, so when I'm walking these two beasts in a few days, and a squirrell decides to run by, I am basicly going to pull a superman flying through the air.  Oh well, it should be quite the experience. I'm looking forward to it... And as for Warped Tour updates, I still have no idea how I am going to get there, hopefully there are some buses that I can take there, but that would be quite the journey. I'm sure I'll have more stories to tell in the week to come!
