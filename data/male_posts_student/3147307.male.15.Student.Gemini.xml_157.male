I am also assuming Allison is Allison Cavanaugh because she mentioned going to Calvin and Rebekah and Ashley have a link, if not then she'll be on here this week only. We also added Jill Hanson to the list this week.) Poorer scores this week but more people scored at least one point. Also, if you go five weeks w/ a zero score then you will no longer be listed. Here goes.  Top Blogs from SSRP for the week of 7/30 - 8/6 (score; +/- from last week)  Honorable Mention (actually we have some this time): Eleni Elder (0;-4), Christy Helweg (0;-4), Ashley Rusk (0;-4), Allen Blackwood (2;E), Ellen Edwards (7;+2), Grace Hanson (10,-3), Allison Cavanaugh (17;N/A), Mia Straw (17; -5)  Top 10!  10.
