There might even be a parade.  So Bill Cosby recently spoke out on the black community. Sort of like a State of the Blackness address, if you will, and for the most part, I agreed with him. I'm a huge believer in education, and without it, you  will  go down the tubes, and have no chance at success in life, unless you get incredibly lucky somehow. Like if you have a lucky hat, or something. It's not just black people, either, and it's certainly not all black people, or perhaps even many. Way too many people of all ethnicities are putting education aside, and it's going to really damage the future.   I just felt the need to point out that in newer BMW models, an iPod can be connected to the car itself and controlled via the steering wheel audio controls. If that's not awesome, nothing is. Now, all that's left is getting that BMW. Might be hard, eh?
