Memory: When I was younger I went with my father to Whistler, he was invited to speak at a conference, and in the mornings I would order room service and watch this Irish soap opera before hitting the slopes. I fell in love with a girl with large, impossibly black eyes and hair to match. I resolved to go to Ireland and marry her. I think I was 14 or 15 years old.  FYI: There's a great site called  urlLink Poguetry  that thoroughly explains all the references made in MacGowan's lyrics. For example, the "Jocks" from this post's title may refer to the Scots, who are sometimes called jocks, or it may refer to Arabs, "as a shortened form of camel jockey." It's a very extensive site.
