Then there's physics. 1 full test to do, one half test to do before Wednesday (I generally find physics one of the easiest subjects, so that shouldn't be too bad too. And geography.....  I would like to point out that the link to Megatrobe's blog now seems to be more... 'attractive' than the others, but don't let this fool you, his is far from the best. Personally, I would say mine is the best of the blogs I have read (I would say that), but also Dickybod's and Stommp's are also worth a read. I'll put a link to the latter one later. I should really post about something else here other than just what I do, as these events can get boring to read after a few minutes.   In the past few days I've been thinking about what I would like to do after A-Levels. I really have barely any idea what I want to do. I've been considering university, although is it really worth it? It's very expensive, especially if you live away from home, and apparently graduates from university have great difficulty finding a job, especially a high paid one, relating to the degree that they did. So, it may be simpler and easier just to give university a miss and go straight into employment at 18. Get a low-down job, and work your way up to the better ones from the inside. I'll probably just be stuck in an office though, which isn't really my ideal job. Previously I was thinking about some sort of Engineering job, drawing structural drawings of buildings and designing bridges. That could be fairly interesting, but it would probably be difficult to get a job after university. The most common advise is to do what you like doing, but (as you may already know) I don't really have any hobbeys or interests. I really should get one at some point.  Well, at least I'm sorted for the next two years. Staying on at Sixth Form, as I don't know what else to do. I decided to choose Physics, Maths, Chemistry and Computing. I'm not quite sure why I chose computing, as I'm not particually good at it, and normally end up just copying Megatrobe the whole time. I don't know how to make a macro on Word, or how the school networking works. Probably because the only other subject I was considering was biology, and I've had more than enough of that over the past 2 years.   Not much else to say for now, so that will be all. 'afternoon all.   Playing:  Had a few games of 'Freecell' yesterday, lost all of them... stupid...get 'em...  Listening To:  'Death of Titanic', from the film score  Watching:  Watched a few old episodes of 'Friends' this morning  Annoyed With:  Business Studies  Confused About:  Business Ratios  Mood:  satisfied
