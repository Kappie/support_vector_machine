Publication is estimated by the year 2050. The film will be the greatest ever. It is due to start filming after I've written the remaining 1,499.5 pages of script (it's a very long film), worked out the plot, got the actors, a director, film crew, money, publishing rights, copyright, my family's blessing, cameras and movie-making equipment, a place to film, and a plan. Filming is due to start in 2055, after my book tour and when the special effects will be what I need. You may apply for parts now, however. We currently need actors/actresses for the following:      Priestly drag queens.  Robot scientists (if robots have been invented by 2055, this part will not be available).  Man who laughs in the face of Danger.  Fleeing refugee No. 45,135.
