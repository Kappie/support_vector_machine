I went with my puppet ministry group to Kankakee, Illinois to the International Festival of Puppetry and Ventrilliquism (sp) or "I-FEST" for short. It was a blast, we learned so much and were all really inspired to continue furthuring our ministry and spreading the word. I got so many good ideas for props in the skits and really developed a desire to want to do puppets myself. I also want to learn to do live puppetry and create my own character with all sorts of manorisms and life in its own. I think with time, this could be something really awesome, and I'll be praying for it.   God Bless, Nick
