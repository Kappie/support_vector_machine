Now I know what most of you are thinking right now, "Why should I care?"  Since most of my readers are rather young, most of you don’t give much thought to income taxes.  You probably don’t even know that April 15th is the deadline to file your end of the endless paper work.  This bill, if passed, will definitely impact your life if you have a job, especially a minimum wage job, like myself.  In addition to eliminating Income Taxes, the bill will also stop the deduction for Social Security out of all our paychecks each week.  The downside to all this is that you’ll pay slightly more for the things you buy.  Ultimately, we’ll all be paying less to fund government.  Stop and think how much money is spent in the US by foreign tourists each year.  All of that money will be subject to the National Sales Tax.  This bill, if signed into law, will create enormous economic growth in the US.  Companies will start outsourcing jobs  into  the US instead of shipping American jobs overseas.    The "fair tax" bill currently has 56 co-signers including only one congressman from PA, Pat Toomey (R).  I’m personally asking my representative, Bill Shuster (R), if he plans to co-sign and support House Bill 25 at a public forum on August 4th. I encourage all of you to ask your respective representative to support House Bill 25, also being called the "fair tax" bill.    Surprisingly, the liberals haven’t openly opposed this bill yet.  But really, what leg do they have to stand on?  Nobody can honestly say that our current system of taxation is fair.  How can anyone say its right to burden the richest 10% of American’s with 50% of the tax bill?  The system needs reform. The less money the government takes from you, the better off we are.
