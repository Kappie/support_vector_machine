Chunk- to you i will my axe, my dancing abilities, the triple N.B., my guitar playing abilities, and my cool curly hair  Chunker- to you i will my bass playing abilities, awesome athletic abilities (heehee like i have tons of it...) my ability to attract men =), and my raunchiness  Jesus- my whole life  Kryt- waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghn, and my elvis lip   and then i also will my upper body to you people (yes, you must split up the days in which you take posession of it) so that when you are lonely or in need of a hug, i will always be there; *with lifeless arms wide open, under the sunlight, welcometo this place ill show you everything. with lifeless arms wide open* i will put a good word in for you to the creator of all, but i feel that that isnt completely necessary figuring i know you are already strong believers. i will truly miss you all, *and at my funeral i will sing....* no,ummm ya...i will have my bass placed nextto my casket so that chunk and Chunker may kiss it as they planned to but never go to...anyways, now that i have my nearly expectant death all planned out, let us change the subject  .....so, how about them padres? jk doesnt it kind of feel like school is still going on? kind of like were on a weekend thingy? well it is the weekend, but i keep thinking that in 2 days im gonna wake up and get ready for school and see all of my friends again. makes me sad. i miss all of my friends...DID YOU HEAR THAT?
