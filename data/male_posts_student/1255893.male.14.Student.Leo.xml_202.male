I mean, I KNOW it, but sometimes it just makes so much sense... it's like rediscovering something you might have lost. Like reconnecting with an old friend, or reviving memories of someone or something that once made you feel like the center of the universe.   I've been learning to appreciate all these seemingly insignificant instances in my day. Like one of those really pretty zephyr winds that seduces you with its gentle embrace. Or waiting in a long line, and when you reach the end, the cute girl at the counter gives you a sweet little smile. Having a great song come up on the radio, one of those songs that just seems to fit the mood. Or walking all the way home after a long day only to realise that the weekend has arrived. I can go on and on. No list of examples could give enough credit to the feeling I get from those instances. Sure is incredible how they can pile up if we take the time to notice them.
