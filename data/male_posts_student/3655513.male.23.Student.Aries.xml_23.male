I have friends promising to hold up signs with "Roosters Blog" written on them. I'm expecting some phenomenal ones in from my a group out of south-western Ontario by Friday. As a thank you to them, I will be putting up a post dedicated to the organizer of this little group, an old friend of mine, Cheryl Bechtold.  On this note, if you are here and would like to get involved, I have a request for all my readers: I want your digital pics of you (or whomever) holding a sign that says "Rooster's Blog" on it (body art is also acceptable) and the picture must be one that I can use to advertise the site. So be creative!  I've been keeping track of my daily hits, and I want to see if this contest and the photos that follow influence traffic. Email pictures and questions about the contest to imtherooster@gmail.com  Looking forward to seeing your entries!  Rooster
