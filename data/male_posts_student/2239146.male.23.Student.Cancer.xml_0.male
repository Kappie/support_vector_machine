These words may cover a variety of topics  be addressed to a variety of audiences, from a word for the Church* in our area, to the Church of America.  (*Please note that by Church we refer to the body of Christ, being every person who has accepted Jesus as their saviour and in any way is pursuing a relationship with him).  We are called the Nameless  Faceless Generation because we strive to be those who will Give all the Glory to God our Father, and keep nothing for ourselves.  Our goal is to make greater His Fame and Glory.     Feel free to share the information you read here with other people as you desire.
