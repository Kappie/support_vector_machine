Mom and Dad had a big TV in there room, but they decided that they wanted a smaller one to fit in their cabinet, so I have the HUGE tv in my room. (Well maybe it isn't exactly huge. I am currently browsing the channels and the best thing on is Rescue Heroes. I hate sundays.  Another reason I hate sundays is because of soccer. Don't get me wrong, I love soccer. It's just the team. There is so much corruption within the higher ranks of our team, not to mention yappy sideline parents. We have won one game, tied one game and lost about a zillion games. We have a practice every sunday at 7:00, I hate that so much, but it doesn't make me angry.  While we were cleaning the basement yesterday, I stumbled upon some books that I may take great interest it. 1,001 Logical Laws, Accurate Aximos, Profound Principals etc, and 10,000 Dreams interpteted. I shall lend it to Michaela to help her with her dreams section on my site. If for some reason you don't know what my site is, it is in my profile.  Well, after saving all the people. The rescue heroes saved a birds nest from a tree and there is this brat whining that her doll house is gone. I hate her too. I have found that this blog is a good place to let out emotions.   OKAY! This "Rescue Hero" told me that is someone dropped as cigerette butt on the ground to say "Hey! The world isn't your ash tray." He is such a loser.  What's on next on the boob tube you ask? A cartoon about a cockroach - robot hybrid. Oh and he talks. Should be great. Too bad I am changing the channel.  Anyway, I could rant about TV all day. But that would be boring wouldn't it? Maybe I'll make a section called "Tv Rants". Oh gosh, see what happens to me when I am bored.  On thursday I went to Spider-Man 2 with Ingrid, Cori, Vedran, Sean A, and Brittney. It was a good movie, but buckle your seats as I am about to start talking in nerd.  It was a very good movie and these are my possible theories for the next one  **Spoilers if you haven't seen it yet**  We KNOW that the Harry-Green Goblin will be in SM3 but here are some other options.  Venom should be in the next movie because MJ was seen dating Jameson's son, who is an astronaut preparing to go to space. The symbiote (which formed Venom) is found on the moon. The symbiote travels back to earth through Jameson and the symbiote rock finds its way to Peter. Peter becomes Venom until he visits good ol Doc Conners, who removes the symbiote from Peter. Peters school-mate, Eddie Brock is then infected with the symbiote and becomes Venom for good. This is when he would team up with Goblin and fight Spidey.  Hob-Goblin - The hob-goblin was often seen fighting with green goblin. To refresh your memory, the Hob-Goblin was the purple and orange one that threw pumpkin bombs.  If they really wanted to, now that MJ knows about Peter being SM, the director could make her Spider-Woman, but I doubt that it is early enough, or a wise decision to do that.  I would really like to have the cartoon Sinister Six in one of these movies the sinister six, led by Kingpin and that guy in the wheelchair were: Doc Ock, Scorpion, Shocker, Rhino, Chameleon, and Mysterio. I like Mysterio and Chameleon, they were always the coolest.  Speaking of Mysterio, my brother rented the Spider-Man 2 game and Mysterio is a boss. He looks so cool and sounds awesome, I hope that is how he is portayed in the movies.  Overall that game is really fun with all places in real New York and it strays from the SM2 plot by adding waaaaaaay more action!  Anyway, that is it for my Spider-Man talk [/nerd]  I have gotten to the point where I can't think of anything else to write, I will most definately be bored tommorow so I will write.
