At around 16:30 I started to apply sunblock(SPF 30) to prepare myself to face the scorching heat of the sun. At around 16:50 I was already at our designated meeting place facing a crisis that cropped up at the last minute but my associates were determined to push through with the plan. After one of my associates made a phone call we decided to push through. Around 18:40 we left the meeting place for Wild Wadi.   My Associates and I decided to take the bus to Wild Wadi. The bus trip was terribly awful, as I entered the bus a ghastly putrid scent pierced my muzzle. Oh, the smell was fucking awful and I have to endure the unbearable stench for less than an hour! Finally at 19:05 we finally disembarked the bus. What a relief for me to get a whiff of fresh air and a relief from the evil stench confined in the bus.   We took a little walk and at 19:55, approximately, two hours before the water park closes, my associates and I finally entered Wild Wadi. With only two hours we hurriedly run and got into the rides. Good for us that we did'nt have to suffer hours of waiting in the line because there was no more lines. All the people left and we were the only ones inside.   Well we certainly enjoyed the two hour wadi exploit but the ironic thing for me was I had sun block lotion smeared all over my body and we entered the park when it was already dark! WTF!? I just wasted a handful of sunblock lotion for nothing!?   Before I end this I just would like to thank all the people who played major roles in making this exploit possible. Thank you vey much! Kudos to you!
