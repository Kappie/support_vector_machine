Well, I'm really lacking sleep now.... signs of me having no energy to work tells me its time I slept in for a while, and get back my vitality. Was a zombie in school... walking and dragging my foot as if they didnt leave the ground. Chem test today was a open book one, and my Physics test got dragged to next Wednesday (yet again).  After school, I headed to the library to do a bit of duty. Decided to play truant on the Science Week event in the hall at 2.40 pm, since its just sitting there and talking.... its darn useless like that.. waste of time.  Didnt even have the mood to take a bus or walk home, took a cab straight home. Sheesh, havent done this for a long time..  Asked Aaron whether if he wanna go out after work, havent reply yet, so now I'm left with 2 options : take a much needed nap, or go out, and shift the much needed 6 speed shifter on the Wangan cabinet.  Maybe blogging again later, I guess thats it for now, so yeah, cya !
