So I'm leaving for Italy in two days. I got some Euros (cash). They're cool, the more the bill is worth the greater its actual physical size, and vice-versa. We stopped at B and I bought Itzhak Perlman/Pinchas Zukerman playing Bach. Sean let me borrow the CD, and its awesome, so I bought it. Now all Sean and I have to do is dually make Katha like it. Oh and I got Perlman playing the Barber concerto. After the first time through, its one of my favorite concertos. Enough crap. Tch√ºs! Oh, anime is filled with girls in skimpy clothes. Even the girl heroes with.. "dignity". As much dignity as a whore I guess.
