I don’t know this time is going to be like before - attack me then leave me to reinforce or this time is the time to stay forever - or not but it is coming back yet again. Feel sorry for myself. However I am happy for myself because at least I had good break, made me ready for it. I didn’t expect it so soon, but what the hell. It comes anyways.
