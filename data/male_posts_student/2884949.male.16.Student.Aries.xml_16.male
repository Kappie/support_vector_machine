Actually, I take that back, I did have an interesting weekend, and today was somewhat interesting. I'll start off with my weekend...  Friday, I went over to my friend Derek's house and his cousin, who is also my friend, Shon was over, and we made a video that had a bunch of Jackass stuff in it... It was pretty cool and fun.. Except for the fact that I got a welt mark on my back from getting hit from a leather belt (that was HILARIOUS!), a bruised knee, and I got kicked in the jaw and the eye, leaving me with them both swollen, and my eye has a scab on my upper eye lid... It's all hilarious nonetheless...   Today, me and my friend Tyler were talking about taking over the world.. We got some good plans going hahahaha... Anyhow, now Im outta here  Later  Jerry
