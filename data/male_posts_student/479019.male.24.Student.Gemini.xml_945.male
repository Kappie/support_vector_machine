Derek and Jon brough over an odd jar of corn whiskey... yes jar... and we were spooning ourselves spoonfuls of the odd stuff. It was pretty much hanging and chatting under the crappy weather. We also watched a bit on the guy who invented the invincible bear suit.  I, then had to wake up for work at 5:15 AM for work. It wasn't so bad since I just loaded up on coffee. The head honcho also stopped by today.  ****
