I had dinner and stayed at my aunt and uncle's place. It was a nice evening, because I got drunk from a continuous flow of wine and passed out at 7:30 PM.  Thursday: I spent most of the day alone at my aunt and uncle's place quietly reading. I got a lot of work done. I now have a better idea about what to write for one of my papers now. My aunt took me to Fuddruckers for lunch and later that night we went to a little Japanese restaurant in Ridgewood for some sashimi.  Now playing: Eddie Money - "Shakin'"  Friday: I got back up to NYC a bit too early Friday morning. So I hung out at the weird Burger King next to the Port Authority. It's weird, because I always see interesting people go in and out of it. Also when I was hanging out outside waiting for Melissa, I saw a voodoo lady, interesting bums, and some slutty looking chicks. Anyway, eventually Melissa and I met up and then she showed me the sights of Flushing. Melissa, Becky, and I wandered around a cemetary, got gyros, got tea and went to CBGBs. There was a lot of hilarity that continued until late night.  CBGBs was cool, but had over priced beer. $6.25 for a bottle of Heineken, meant that the coolness wore off as the beer wore off. This and Detox Darlings weren't bad, but were trying to live in the 80s a bit too hard.  Now playing: Smashing Pumpkins - "Sweet Sweet"  Saturday: We got some bagels from the infamous Bagel Oasis that morning and then saw some virtual dragonboating. We also hung out with my cousin Kelly for a bit before I took a Greyhound back to Binghamton.   There was more hilarity on Saturday too, but it's hard to describe. I had a lot of fun.  I stopped by a GSO downtown before going home. Got myself a few free slices of pizza, beer, and wine. It wasn't that great.  Sunday: So far today I've done my laundry, saw  Old School , and got some Burger King.  Now playing: Sting - "Desert Rose"  Stuff to do for the rest of today:  print shit out on campus read that shit Now playing: Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros - "Road to Rock and Roll"  ***
