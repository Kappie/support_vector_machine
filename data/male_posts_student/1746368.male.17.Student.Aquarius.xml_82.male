I didn't go to school today. I pretty much read and played my Gameboy.  I was playing "Final Fantasy Tactics: Advance". It's pretty addicting, but eventually it gets boring. I played for about 3-4 hours straight. That tells you that the game takes a while to get boring. Generally my limit is like 1 hour by myself and maybe 2-3 with friends. So I guess it would be adequate to say that I was wrong, it will hold my attention.  In other news, the "Site o' the day" is back. Classical archives is a great place to get classical music. Even though you can only download 5 a day if you aren't a member, it is still very much worth it.  Well, I think I shall get going. My head is starting to hurt and it feels like I have acid reflux. Talk to you guys later. I shall keep you posted about my conditions.
