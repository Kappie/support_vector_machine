So I guess if this turns out cool I'll start writing more and this may actually become a more updated source of "Tim's Coolness" updates then my subprofile, because their servers are totally unreliable, not to mention slow. Hmm yup, well I guess for the sake up linking the two places up I'll just give you a link to my sub-profile, let you decide for yourself how things are. Well yea here it is  urlLink my old sub-profile  enjoy.       On a sidenote I guess I realize that I'm totally going out on some tangent using Blogger, something I have never heard of until 2 minutes ago when I just happened to come across it surfing the internet. Yea since I'm asian and all guess I "should" be using Xanga or something, but you know, I'm a non-conformist, so sue me.  For the sake of this being the first entry, I actually went through the whole thing and took out internet slang and capitalized all letters needing to be capitalized. Feel lucky that I am providing you people with such luxury. So yea, don't expect such elegant entries from now on out!
