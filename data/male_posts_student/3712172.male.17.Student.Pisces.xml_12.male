Misery is the world, and the world is misery,  Sin is human, and human is sin,  Perfect is a dream, and a dream is perfect  Contradictions exist within reality, and reality exists within contradictions,  Seeing is believing, and believing is seeing.  Knowledge is power, but  without power it's dormant.  Life lessons are from experience, but life is its own.  Learning from life,  bestows us with knowledge  Using knowledge proves your beliefs, and your beliefs are then seen.  To see is to observe, and observation causes discrepancy  Consistency excludes uniqueness and, in turn eliminates life.  Life is sin.  Sin is misery.  Sinful Misery.
