I don't want to add people and then find out that they have nothing to say, or that they make oodles of grammatical errors (I would have to kill you!). All that I know is that I want something with substance, we don't want to know every detail of your day! So if that’s all you have to say, don’t even think about asking… I want students (or former students) to be able to express themselves...is that so much to ask?!!
