I'm probably going to leave school at lunchtime tomorrow because we have to arrive in Toronto relatively early to set up at the LAN, so that's sort of a bonus.  I'm thinking of redoing the site to a kind of roundish, bubbly design, but I'm not sure yet. I'm way too busy with the huge pile of homework that every teacher seems to be piling on during May, which is another reason why I love my school so much.
