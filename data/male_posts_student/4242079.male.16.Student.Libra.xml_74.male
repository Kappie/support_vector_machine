It was nice to just sit on the couch and eat popcorn with her, it made me really happy, to know that we can still just hang out. Yes, I'm happy. She made one of those "Quiz Your Friends" quiz things, and I got 50%. In some ways, she's changed, I see that in my test results, and other things, I'm sorry to say, I may have never known the answer, or was mislead to believe somethign other than the truth.   Work. Why am I here? I just want to go hang myself in the back room. Swing back and forth to the beat of my boss' depressing music. BLAH.
