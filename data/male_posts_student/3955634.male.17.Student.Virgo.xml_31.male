These men, who did not even serve on the same boat as Kerry, are making wild accusations left and right. At one point, the book claims that "Kerry entered an abandoned Vietnamese village and slaughtered the domestic animals owned by the civilians and burned down their homes with his Zippo lighter."  This is coming from the same right wing that claimed everything Kerry did in Vietnam was to prepare for an eventual career in politics. So which is it, I wonder? Was Kerry a picture-perfect example of false chivalry, or a wild and loose cannon who wandered around endangering his crewmates (who overwhemingly support him) and harming innocents?  The Republicans are sinking to incredible new lows in this election. From their financing, and petitioning  urlLink on behalf of Ralph Nader , to the  urlLink absolute lies about John Kerry and his agenda , and now this. If the American people don't call Bush and his cronies on this, then you can bet that '08 is going to be even dirtier.
