Didn't even get to celebrate Father's Day, while the relief is happily spending Father's Day with his family. Luckly bloke.   Mom's not home too, working as a cashier.  So, this is the first time me and my brother are left home alone for the night. Kinda scary.....But never mind. Mom will be back later....  Sigh. Goodnight.
