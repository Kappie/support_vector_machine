      Today has not been a very productive day, and not very fun either. The only kinda fun thing that I did was watch Star Trek: Generations, the movie where Picard and Kirk join forces to stop a manic searching for the Nexus of Joy. Maybe tomorrow will be better, but I doubt it.  Live Long and Prosper
