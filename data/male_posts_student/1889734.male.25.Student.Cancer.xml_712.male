Do you think the media is overplaying this?  Are you tired, or does your sense of outrage grow?  I really think this is going to blow up on the Bush Haters, just as the 9/11 commision turned out to be nothing more than a stage for grandstanding politicians of both parties.  The public tuned out a long time ago, which is really a shame since there could have been some value in a proper investigation of 9/11.    Abu Ghraib is the new Vietnam-cadence.  Those that hate us will use this to justify thier hate.  Those that know better will see this for what it was and move on with life.  And I think most of the great unwashed undecideds can recognize this for what it is.  As for intelligence gathering, I wonder how much we've learned from these prisoners using these tactics?  The recent chemical weapon attack foiled in Jordan might have come from some data out of Abu Ghraib.  As someone else said - the intelligence didn't come to Queen Noor in a dream.  Someone had to wring it out of a bad guy, and as a result, a lot of Jordanians are still alive.    We should consider this with a little more sensibility than simple pious outrage.
