Hardly anyone wants to talk, they say hi, some chit chat with no substance and off about their adgenda's. Cashiers, customers, friends and family alike. Though I must admit my parents have an actual conversation with me about three times a year.  Not a very fun day, got called in to work four hours early, so I did an eight hour day. Every muscle below my pelvis is sore as hell as well, due to over stretching at karate... just when I was thinking I could compete with yoga people like Danielle. So, pushing carts for the odd five hours I had to do them... not fun, though do you notice how pain fades away when you stop caring? Though now that I think about it I don't feel pain when I got an adrenline rush either. Pain... is often just a matter of acceptance, if you accept something is going to hurt, don't care, it doesn't hurt as much. I remember that from when I fractured my leg and arm.  So to sum things up, not a good day. I am largely ignored by everyone around me, other than some old dude who spits at people whilst he talks. My legs hurt.
