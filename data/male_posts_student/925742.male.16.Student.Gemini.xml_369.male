So after that my parents and I went to the Mekong store on Q street and got some Asian food.  I can already smell the cooking.  I also ate this nice coconut 'dahn bao chi' stuff.  I'm sure it was "XXXX bao chi". It ruled.  And while I was in the store I saw this white guy and his asian wife and their kid; I couldn't help but think *aaaaaaaaw....maybe*. ~~~~~~~~~ I don't *know* either.  I don't ask for you, or anybody, to *know*.  I just want you to be happy.  I just want to be with you.  To talk...personal and private.  To hold...  :)
