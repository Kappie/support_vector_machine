That sh*t is CRAZY! Its psychedellic trance and its awesome, any of you out there who slightly like trance music, or need somethin to trip to go download or buy a Infected Mushroom CD. Some good songs are "Never ever land" and "Dream Theater" . I wish I didn't feel like sh*t.....o well....  LaTeR -HAZE-
