I did not, not that I can remeber. The children's pastor at our church asked me to play piano for the christmas play they are doing. I would of had to refuse if it was actual christmas music. Luckily they are doing a parody of "Toy Story" (I thought I had told you guys, if I had then you are reading again; please tell me if I did). I get to learn how to play the "Youv'e got a friend in me" song. Yet with different words. It will be most awesome. I am pretty much done with this post. Nothing really new. Oh, I did get a new GBA game. I got "Final Fantasy Tactics: Advance". It is pretty interesting so far. But, it probably won't hold my attention. Well, talk to you all later. In the words of Patrick Starfish: "Liar liar, plants for hire".
