I bought the paper to see what was going down in  urlLink my old hometown  and was delighted to see this bold use of local dialect. I showed it to my brothers, who grew up here, and neither of them could even readily understand it. 'Wed' of course means 'married'. The gunman in question was the sometime boyfriend of the local pub landlady - the landlady of the Sanford arms, known locally as the Sanford, the pub closest to  urlLink my school , the only pub serving the southern part of town, about a 5 minute walk up the road from me and a few years ago the main pub for pupils (in my day, it was the Vintage [known as 'the Vint'], but I think the cops cracked down on that years ago) - who according to this story planned to marry her. But she got back with another boyfriend and the 'gunman' came into the Sanford one night earlier this year and shot his rival in the face with a pistol, killing him instantly. He claims the gun went off by accident. Another thing about England is that no-one here has seen  Supersize Me . In fact, no-one here has even  heard  of it. This would explain why Australia is the only country in the world to have addressed the film in its advertising - it is probably the only country in the world where McDonald's diners have actually been watching the movie.
