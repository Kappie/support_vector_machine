Well the EU elections are over and it appears that in general, few people bothered to vote in the elections, and a great deal of those did, voted for parties campaigning against the EU, including my much hated UKIP. I think Kilroy-Silk put why not to vote for them best - when asked what he intended to do in the EU parliament he replied to 'wreck' it in a news conference yesterday, in which he overshadowed UKIPs leader who was also present.  I don't look upon him at all kindly if you hadn't noticed, he was forced to resign from his previous job after some racsist comments. And he didn't do well in that job to make good television [awful daytime television instead];   urlLink http://www.robertkilroysilk.com   Rant over. Kilroy bad. Green Party good.
