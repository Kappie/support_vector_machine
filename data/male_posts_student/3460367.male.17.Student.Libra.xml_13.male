I should be able to sleep finally.  I didn't tell her how I've been affected physically with all this but I don't think she needs to know.  I got another bombshell tho.  Carrie is going to have a major surgery on her back again.  Then tonight my parents told me my mom is pregnant again but it looks like there are going to be some complications.  She might not be able to carry the child to term.  I don't think I can handle this right now.  So I'm trying to not think about any of it.  Today at Bobi's I licked 40 dollars worth of stamps.  Kevin hurt his shoulder and can't come to the concert.  So now Kyle doesn't seem like he wants to come.  IDK.  Life it's a blast... oh well.
