Within 50 seconds there were small bubbles, and within 56 seconds there was a roaring boiling.  Wow... compared to the 1:24 of the standard air pressure (101 kPa), :56 is a great time.  This is especially true when you consider that there was 6 ounces of water and 26 ounces of air in the container.  In theory, the more water we have, the more substantial difference in times there will be.   I need to double check the first time (unsealed bottle in microwave).  I will do that just as soon as the bottle and water cool down.  I didn't time it specifically, but I seem to remember that I started with 3 minutes, and ended with 1:36.  I will let you know as soon as I reconduct the experiment.  Wow... I am so excited.  I can't believe this theory actually works in practice.  What is better is that the 6 ounces of water and 26 ounces of air means that the times can only get better, the fuller the machine is.  Wow...  -Ben Salinas  EDIT:  I reheated the unsealed bottle, and it was almost down to the second: 1:24!
