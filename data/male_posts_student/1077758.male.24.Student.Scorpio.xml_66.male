While I was in town for a doctor's appointment, we ran over to Red Lobster to grab a bite to eat.  Of course, service was slow, and she ended up taking almost a 2 hour lunch break, but it was enjoyable.  Those damned biscuit things they have are dangerously close to ambrosia.   You take those for a meal, then eat the angel biscuits they've got at Bolton's Landing, and you've got a meal of bread.  Jesus couldn't make a better meal than that, especially if it was unleavened.  Man, somebody needs to introduce the Lord and Savior to things like yeast, cheese, and salt.  Also I'd like to know who his personal trainer was, because in all European depictions of him, Jesus is cut like fucking Mister Universe.
