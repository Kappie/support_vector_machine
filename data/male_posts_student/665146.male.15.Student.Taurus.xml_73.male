And after all the Mr. Rogers stuff, how could I go back to bitching about bad movies?  Now, I'm not writing this little blurb because I actually have something to express, I'm doing this because I'm listening to the Pulp Fiction soundtrack. And anything you do is instantly fourty times cooler when listening to Misirlou by Dick Dale.  So here we go again people, I'm resorting to writing about my day:  I've been listening to the Pulp Fiction soundtrack way too much, and stuck in my head through the day.  Redundant surfing music was playing even as the walkout died over the PA system.  Teachers and counselors guarded the exits and all I could think of was how Dick Dale had such nimble fingers.    That's enough.  Anyway, if you haven't heard the news already, then this'll come fast, hard, and ridiculous. (Furthermore, it would be most saddening for you to have the epiphany that you can count the low-budget journal of a thirteen-year-old as one of your news sources.)  A man in Albany was arrested in a mall for wearing a shirt that said, "Peace on Earth" and "Give Peace a Chance".   Two men (father, 61, and son 31) were wearing the shirts  MADE  in a store in the mall, and were asked to either remove the shirts or leave.  The son complied and took his shirt off, but the father refused to and was arrested.  I know, I know. It's horrid.  There are an infinate amount of things more offensive than "Peace on Earth", and some of them were probably being worn in the mall.  Yet for some reason unbeknownst to myself, the mall security asked them to leave the premises because of their shirts.  On the brighter side of it, it's funny as hell.
