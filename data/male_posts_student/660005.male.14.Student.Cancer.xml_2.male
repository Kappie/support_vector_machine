I made a lot of phone calls, mostly of what I am to do the rest of the week. I have a meeting with a restaurant owner to teach him how to use his computer(he leads a sad, sad, computer-deprived life), and to know to call someone to build their  urlLink Permanent Cosmetics  website for them. I also have a meeting from 5:30-10:00 searching around downtown Nowhere, Arkansas on some crazy hunt(which sounds strangely interesting), then Friday, a large gathering at my church. I have also planned having a small gathering at a friend's home on a lake. It should be wet. Very wet. A jet ski, a party barge, a speedboat, a big screen, and a few close friends is all it takes to make a disas- I mean- fun time. Talk to you then.
