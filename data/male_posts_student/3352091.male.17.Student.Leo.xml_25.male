Theres this girl from the C of C (im going there next year) in the cast im currently in, and quite beautiful i may say. Anywho im not exactly the most outgoing confident guy so i hadnt asked her to really do anything though im attracted to her. Well as coincidence would have it the show was cancelled today and as i was walking out to my car to get something she drives through the parking lot(and im loooking like an idiot cause i have this afgan blanket over my head cause i was joking around with theatre friends and im going out to my car to grab my phone) and rolls down the window to say hey and give me my pen back that she has had for like three days now. Well we talked to a minute and like out of nowhere (probably my subconsious) i just spit out the words and ask her if she wanted to go to coffee underground for something to drink or eat and she said yes to my astonishment. Once i met her there like ten minutes later dude we sat there and talked for over and hour. We talked about theology, morals, theatre, college, man this girl is awsome. Only thing we talked about relationships and she sounded like she didnt want one currently, she said how she has constantly been in one since ninth grade and how she didnt plan it that way but how it just happened. Maybe itll "just happen" again. well this girl is awsome ive never talked to anyone except my best friend for an hour straight about the stuff we discussed. And the thing is i was totally comfortable around her. Hey maybe college has more in store for me than just learning and meeting new people and gaining a theatre portfolio
