Well life hasnt changed too much since i last talked, im still michael, havent lost any arms or legs, still live in the same house with pretty much the same friends, but i don know how to build a 3d house now!  it may seem boring but i usually manage to entertain myself fairly well!! ok enough of the blabberin.  im spend for my first new entry im about to head off to bed and i will just have to try and remember to write to yall soon.  hope everyones life has been doin good!  if you ever feel like callin my number is 594-9172, at least for now, bc my phone is a P(eice)O(f)S(hit) and it only works when i need it to least but i will eventually get back to ya.  G'night and laturz.  ~Michael
