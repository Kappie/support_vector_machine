Future Hilton Sister #1, for inspiring me to create this beautiful BLOG and for the title: "En Fuego: Latino Heat- El Blog de Nate." Gracias. Today was a pretty average day, went by kinda slow. Abigail and I made a tribute to Valerie in Fashion class on the board, which was so artistic, Picasso would have eaten his heart out (JAILHOUSE ROCK AND SEX!). After school, I went out with Lulu to see Harry Potter 3 (Very disappointing... I feel as if I have a hole in my soul.) Talked to a few people on the phone and realized that we all make big fat mistakes in our lives (You know who you are), and that the world is a reallllllly small place. I also just noticed that it's 11:40 PM (I have SATs tomorrow), this means I must venture to my bed.  PAZ AFUERA  ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT.
