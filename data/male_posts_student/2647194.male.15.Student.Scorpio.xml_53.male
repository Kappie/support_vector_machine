Which, by the way, had horrendously dirty red old carpet, complete with a coat of mouse droppings along every wall and behind every shelf, and lots and lots of dirt. And yes, my away message today was "I like dirt".  2. I did get the opportunity of going to the Underground tonight, and you know, I have to consider it a highlight of any given week. I watched part of Cheaper by the Dozen, shot pool surprisingly well tonight, attempted to play wall-ball (but I kept throwing it too hard, and no one else would play dammit). Then Buddy and Dan tried to cart off my bike. Nevermind the fact that my bike is worth more than Dan...lol. Yeah, but its always fun, especially when Amanda's there too.  3. I did get absolutely soaked on the way home, but no Amanda, I didn't kill myself. is that a good thing?  4. About the entry title...I was rappin' in da hood with my g-dawg Will. yeah...we came up with some really crazy stuff. I don't really care to give an exerpt...  Hm....how about I mix Will's blog with mine and put in a Led Zeppelin song? hm?  "Queen of Light took her bow, And then she turned to go,  The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom, And walked the night alone.   Oh, dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light.  The dark Lord rides in force tonight, And time will tell us all.   Oh, throw down your plow and hoe, Rest not to lock your homes.   Side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all.   I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley blow,  I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glow.   The apples of the valley hold, The seeds of happiness,  The ground is rich from tender care, Repay, do not forget, no, no.  Dance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light.   The apples turn to brown and black, The tyrant's face is red.   Oh the war is common cry, Pick up you swords and fly.  The sky is filled with good and bad that mortals never know.   Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow,  Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow.   The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath,  The drums will shake the castle wall, the ring wraiths ride in black, Ride on.   Sing as you raise your bow, shoot straighter than before.  No comfort has the fire at night that lights the face so cold.   Oh dance in the dark of night, Sing to the morning light.  The magic runes are writ in gold to bring the balance back. Bring it back.   At last the sun is shining, The clouds of blue roll by,  With flames from the dragon of darkness, the sunlight blinds his eyes."  -"The Battle of Evermore"
