I won't list all the annoyance of my day, but holy shit I hated them, I hated them one, I hated them all.  From cell phone cut-outs in the middle of important conversations, to law school application set-backs.  From car rental bills, to vehicular disturbances not being repaired after 5 days of work and hundreds of moneys spent.  Much more to the list, but I'll spare myself the mental anguish of reliving the hell that was December whateverthedateis.  Technically this all happened "yesterday" as it is now WEDNESDAY!!!!  WOOO, "hump" day.  Maybe I'll go hump something.  What a horrible term.. "hump day."  Are you kidding me?  Stupid stupid stupid.  People who make shit like that up should shampoo my crotch.  Next.  It was cold today.    Next.  Christmas, I don't know what I want either lauren.  I read your post and realized that I don't really have any big wishes for the Christ's birthday either.    Hey what ever happened to LFO?  I think it's fly when girls stop by for the summer, for the summer also.  Don't we need a little more of LFO in our lives?  I mean what other people do you know can transition topics better than them (save for maybe the anchors on the evening news who have clever lil' transition such as "speaking of homicide, i'm about to KILL someone it's so hot, Phil- tell us about the weekend forecast").   Example given: (a line from "summer girls abercrombie something rather song." by LFO..  here it is:  "I feel better when you're near.. there was a good man named Paul Revere."  If that's not lyrical GENIUS, you better frickin' believe I want a comment letting me know WHAT IS.  So the last time I posted, I mentioned Shakira, and forgot to leave out that she has a genius status IQ.  Thank you for bringing that to my attention, faithful readers.  You know who I think DOESN'T have a genius status IQ?  Tiffany.  The artist formerly known as, anyway.  She probably goes by Dr. Tiffany now or something more "adult" sounding, like her friend Debbie (aka Deborah) Gibson.  I met Ms. Tiffany at one point in time when she was on campus.  How desperate must an artist be in order to perform a free concert to college kids who simply go so that they can say they heard "I think We're Alone Now" live?  Hell I was shittin' my diapers when that song was popular.    Speaking of musical artists:  Seal.  What is it?  Is it acne scars?  Is it a burn?  Did someone cut you?  I WANT TO KNOW Seal, what's on your face?  Did you get kissed by a rose (hence you song) but the thorn parts got'cha instead of the petal parts?    Cheers.
