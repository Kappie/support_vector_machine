I'm even a little happy that the liberals' true colors have started to  urlLink show through .   Good grief, and the liberals call us hypocrites! They say that we are fighting a war because of a grudge or over oil, but they are willing to fight simply because they disagree with someone. I can just see their signs:    End Violence: Kill the Republicans!    Hypocrisy runs rampant on the Left, but rarely does anyone hear about it. The Left fights for free speech as well--free speech for all who agree with them. They say that everyone should be tolerant, but they forget to tolerate thosethat they perceive to be intolerant.   They say our children should be better educated, while they attack school vouchers and homeschooling, the best hopes for educating America's children.   They claim to be a party that defends the freedom of the average person, or the little guy. They neglect to defend, and they even oppress, the freedoms of the littlest guys of all. The Left keeps the destitute in bondage, and supports the oppression of citizens in totalitarian countries.   The left is all about freedom, but it neglects to spread the freedom around. They want freedom--for themselves! Should the Left achieve its goals, it would closely resemble--no, it would  be  the Dictatorship of the Proletariat which Karl Marx prescribed in his  Communist Manifesto  and furthermore, that would be their end goal. The Leftists fight for the exact same things that the Socialists fight for; if you don't believe me, compare the goals of the Socialists and the Liberals! Central to both systems is the philosophy of secular humanism. The stated goals of the Socialists and the implied goals of the Liberals are exactly the same. If they have the same structure, secular humanism, they will never be different.   Liberalism is built on denial and paradox. Liberals say "Freedom for all--all of us Leftists," and "We are tolerant of everyone--but you." They claim to be astraightforward philosophy of inclusion, but they are really a philosophy of fine print and exceptions. They are a philosophy of deception. They know that they would have no supporters if they said "We fight for our own benefit and no one else's." Therefore, they say " We fight for everyone's benefit.   Some restrictions apply  ."        They claim that Conservatism is exclusionary and selfish because Conservatism fights for people based on the assumption of each person's inherent worth and right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Conservatives say that everyone has rights that can be improved or lost, based on behavior, and the accountability-hating Liberals find this offensive.     Lie-beralism has a faulty base. Secular humanism is a philosophy that can never work. Such a system as Liberalism can never stand if it adheres to its own principals because it's principals are destructive. Liberalism self-destructs and it attempts to counter this by convincing itself and others that it actually stands for more wholesome values. Saying that it stands for freedom sounds better than saying that it stands for freedom to sin. By changing the definitions of key words, the Lie-berals make their atrocious system of values more palatable to the average person.     Let there be no doubt in anyone's mind: Liberalism is a faulty system. Secular humanism, the foundation of Liberalism, is fallacious in its assumptions and tenets, and thus provides a warped base for the "free and inclusive" system of Liberalism. Should America adhere to these false tenets and place itself upon the warped base of Secular Humanism, America would surely fall, for if America seeks to imitate a self-destructive system, America would inevitably self-destruct as well.    Peace (through strength), y'all.    Neo
