Met up with Adele, Ig, Elsie, Rosie, Rose, Digby, Jed, Joel and Alastair in town today. 'Twas cool. Also saw Moth, who stole my purple shirt. She did promise me she'll get it back to me somehow, though, so that's cool ^_^. I like Moth, she's all huggy. Actually, Elsie was really nice today. What she said to me a couple of times was "You should meet up with us again, you're funny, I like you". Which is nice. Pity she's too young for her opinion to count for much but still (she's going into Year 10 next year, bless). Meh, it was cool today anyway. Ig is useful to use as a pillow, whereas I am useless and kept telling Rose that she wasn't as old as she said she was, which made everyone think I was mean but... she looks really young. Good, just young. OK, that came out badly, sodd off. Yes, 2 ds. It's the Welsh spelling.  Saw the NYO on't Telly tonight. They rule. Think, I'm going to be in them next year (I'm thinking happy thoughts, happy wonderful thoughts that involve me being all over-confident).  Quote of the day: "I'm looking for the tower of learning, I'm looking for the copious prize. I saw it in your eyes, What I'm looking for."
