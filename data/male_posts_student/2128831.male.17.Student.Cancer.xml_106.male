Completely unrelated to anything, but I just rewatched Chuck  Buck (2000) that was on Showcase by my #3 (sometimes #2) favourite guy, Mike White. I forgot just how gay, or homoerotic the film was until tonight. Maybe it's because I didn't really know who Mike White was when I originally saw C I was mentioning the theme of the film to a friend of mine and I asked him out of curiousity, "Do you think Mike White is gay?" G's response was, "No, that's his character!" I firmly believe that as a writer, a lot of the stuff that we put on paper (thematically) is stuff that's in our sub/conscious. Either that, or you're just a really good writer with the ability to create an entire world full of characters from scratch, i.e. your own imagination without any of your subconscious filtering through. Just something interesting to think about!    Friday.    So today is Friday, the best day of the week. My rankings of the days of the week? 1. Friday (last day of work before the weekend, anticipation is high/Friday gets REAL good at about 5 p.m.) 2. Saturday (who's gonna argue with a day off!?) 3. Sunday (3rd 'cause it's still a day off, but it's also the day before the worst day of the week) 4. Thursday (it's almost FRIDAY!) 5. Wednesday (eh, stuck in the middle again) 6. Tuesday (at least it's not MONDAY!) 7. Monday (ugh, is it Friday yet!?)    ADVICE FOR NON-COLLEGE BOUND  ADVICE FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT GO TO COLLEGE  1. Go to College 2. If not doing #1: Get a Job 3. If 12 don't work out for you ...   4. Save your high school school phonebooks, since you will not meet that many new people, you will have a shortage of parties - also, find a community college website. Now you know when school is out- and your old firends will be home 5. Unless you were fun to party with in high school, one or two of your old friends might actually talk to you - and therefor invite you to a party.  6. Like all kids your age in school, you too will drink all the time, any time. the difference is that you don't have to go to Conceptual 19th Century English the next morning, so you can drink more - and not worry about the hang over 7. When hung over, stay in bed 8. When your college going friends come by, they will try to make you feel "stupider" (lol) and use words like "Conceptual arithmatic". all they are doing is combineing words - you can too. some examples are, "Beer Bong" "Beer Bottle" "need Money" "Fuck off" - see its easy. 9. You will find that you have absolutely no sense of time. it will be 7:30am when you go to bed one day, and maybe the next three you dont sleep at all. your life will have absolutely no way to recycle its self, unless you go to church. when your friends call and say wanna do something, you never have to worry about doing anything the next day 10. For the first few months, strip clubs can be fun, until you run out of money, like your college going friends 11. When in the strip club, DO NOT TOUCH! 12. Watch MTV ... why, simple the shows they have were made for people like you. most tv shows air weekly, those shows have multiple episodes daily, so you can follow along better than someone who has to go to classes 13. Get used to living with your parents. thats right, if you think that with out a job, you can afford to live elsewhere, your wrong. If you can crash with a girl friend by all means do it.  14. Friends houses are good sources of food. when your pantry runs dry, hit up your friends. eat dinner with them if you can.  15. Start working out - inmates do it all day, so they dont get bored ... you should too. you too can fall victim to the freshman 15 even when your not a freshman 16. Procrastinate - you are a god at it. college kids think they are best at such things, but think about it - you put off going to school - you got them there. 17. Money - you will not have much of it. my theory is enjoy it when you have it, sleep when you dont. A) live like a king while you can, otherwise bills will claim it all B) sleep - you don't feel hunger and time passes quickly. 18. Get to know your creditors - so when they call you every day, you can talk to them, like "hi fred, how you doing? how did your kids do on that big standardized test the other day? wife still banging the mail man? ... when you make friends with them, they might erase your debt - highly unlikely, but you can dream right - besides, its someone to talk to in the middle of the day 19. Learn to ask your parents for money, just like college kids. Creativity is key - for example, "beer money" = "money for food" 20. Go to college parties, just wander in, grab a beer, and when people ask you who you know say john, when your asked which classes your in or similar questions, change the subject to "lets chug!". if you crash the same parties and incite the most drinking games, people will gradually just assume your part of the group and call you to let you know when the parties are.  21. When the bastards at McDs mess up your order at 2am, remember - you are unemployed, so go complain to their manager in the morning - what better do you have to do? 22. On a similar note learn what places are open all night. for a cheap cup of coffee to Denny's or IHOP. you meet cool people, and the coffee is bottomless - $1.50 per person. can't beat that. 23. If you smoke - you better have a source of cash, if you own a car - when the creditors call for the first time, make it look really nice, and sell it - you can'f afford it, but keep a key just incase - you can always find who you sold it to ... (if you steal your car back ... i didn't tell you to - so don't finger me) 24. Get a new set of clothes - undershirts, pajama pants, a robe, ect ... your not required to go out side and go to class - you can sit and watch tv all day 25. Shower after you wake up ... this ensures you shower atleast 6/7 days a week. 26. Play on things like an xbox - get sports games, especially baseball ones, they have 200+ game seasons, the game takes a while, and its laid back enough that if you go to the bathroom and then scrounge for food for an hour between pitches, the game never moves. 27. When you feel like stopping a project do it - you can contiunue later ... like im about to do with this (ok, i promise ill add to this, and revise it and one day put it all together ... not now though I have to jet off.
