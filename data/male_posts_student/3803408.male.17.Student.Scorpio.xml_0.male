Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel ( measuring basket), but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your  Father  Which is in heaven.         Matthew 5:13-16            Yo W@$'uP y'A1L?!
