FREE frickin concert!  on jul 4th, the goo goo dolls are playing @ niagara square... another FREE concert!  now i'm not so big into the dolls' new stuff... but they rock out buffalo.  i'm tellin ya... it's gonna be a good show.  plus... they haven't released the sched for the US side of the friendship fest (FREE) that buffalo has every year with fort erie during which we celebrate our respective country's independence days.  kim mitchell's playing in fort erie on the 4th... i feel bad for her to have to go up against the goo goo dolls.  mainly cause she's a really good and established musician.  then for the one i've been waiting for for the longest... spirit of the west is playing on jul 15th for the thursday @ the square concert series @ lafayette square.  they're gonna pack in the square and we're gonna have a jolly old time.  oh and it's FREE!  we also have blue rodeo with universal honey opening up for thur @ the sq on jul 1st, and the juliet dagger who i'm just starting to get into on sept 2nd.  plus the buffalo phil has got some concerts @ artpark in jul this summer... and we've got shakespeare in delaware park (FREE)... a multitude of art, ethnic, and food fests going on... this is gonna be a great summer.  just what i needed... i've been missing out on this for 6 years.  the only other thing i could possibly want... maybe they'll get the low to play the marina again!  ok... i'm gonna go... send good vibes if you've got any... i'll need them for the rest of the first summer session classes.  and new york crew... i shouldn't even have to give you reasons to visit me (haha!), but if ben folds, guster, and the dolls can't convince you... and or spirit of the west can't convince you... well... i might as well just disown all of you!  GO FLAMES!!!
