I do wonder what would have happened if i had been, and then been patronized by former governer Wyse, the so. Baptist preacher. I shudder to think. So Spent last night sewing patchwork and watching colonial house. Obviously my rock star lifestyle is slipping a little. It must be the rain. It seems to pull me down somehow. Especially now that it is on it's fourth solid day. This afternoon after work the moms and the two D's are helping me move my old couches to the alley for pick up on city clean up day on thurs. And have not heard from Josh or Damien, and i really want to hang out with Josh, and i really want a chance to say goodbye to Damien before he moves away which is sometime this week.
