Mrs Rimes decided to mix up our pieces between the Concert Choir ((me)) and the Mixed Choir.  it was crazy cuz everyone was talkin back stage and WE WERENT SUPPOSED TO CUZ EVERYONE COULD HEAR!  anyways... other than that and the fact that i hate most of the songs cuz i'm  SICK OF THEM .  but yeah.  other than that... i really dont feel like talkin bout anything else.  its easier to keep my private life, well private.  so yeah.  maybe another time ill let you in on the woes of the life of Kristopher.  but for now im off cuz there's a good show on tv and i dont feel like starin at this computer screen.
