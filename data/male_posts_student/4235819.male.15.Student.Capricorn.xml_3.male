Therefore, I have compiled a list of grammar rules that should be used, even when posting on a site like this one.  1.  Corekt spelling is esinchal. 2.  capItolS shouLd alWaYs bE used WISELY. 3.  There are no sentences that you should drop the preposition of. 4.  Keep entirely unnecessary words off of my site! 5.  People should always use the correct words in they're posts. 6.  Remember to use apostraphe's correctly.  Its good practice! 7.  Conjuctions should always be used correctly but properly. 8.  Never use no double-negatives. 9.  While subordinate clauses should not be used as sentences. 10.  Commas, are not always, necessary.
