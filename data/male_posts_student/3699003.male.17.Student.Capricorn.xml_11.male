I've tried writing a few songs in the past without any luck. I put together a sweet chord structure and melody only to find that I've just carbon-copied an 80's pop song. So now I'm trying a different approach to song-writing. With a worship-centred heart, I'll just let God speak to me and keep a pen and paper ready at all times. No "power sessions" can produce the music that God wants me to produce.   God, let this be the beginning of something superbly wonderful. Amen.  Rockin' for Christ - J.J. Johnson
