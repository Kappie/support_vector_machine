In this blog I aim to give you a detailed account of my life. I will describe each day wether the day being good or bad! In saying this I feel that I must express that I will NOT be writing in this blog each day if I do not have the time. I will try to make a little time each day to write in this blog, but if I dont have time then I will just write double on the next day! lol  As I am human there will be some days that I wont be able to write in this blog e.g. when I am on holiday (Which is actually next month) but when this happens I will tell you and make sure that you all know when this will be!  If you would like to know more about me then just click on my profile which can be seen very clearly on the site (Its on the right hand side of the webpage if you didn't know lol)  Well this post is only a quick introduction to my page so enjoy and I will get back to you lot soon!  Bye!  Stefan
