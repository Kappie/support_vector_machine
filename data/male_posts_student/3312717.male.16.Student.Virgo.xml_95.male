However, Mattson was so incredibly far off that I can't help but reveal the truth. He missed all but ONE of them. Ouch. So, here they are, with true owners.  "If man did not have worries, he would not be man. Worries are the foundation of humanity." - All Houley.  "Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it." Not me, but Confucius...  "The highest destiny of the individual is to serve rather than to rule." - Einstein  "Beyond that frontier lay another. And beyond this lays yet another, and another. There will always be frontier, though it may change in appearance and temperament, for mankind to seek." - This one was me.  "Our country was founded on a distrust of government. Our founding fathers gave power to the people to keep an eye on government. So when politicians say, Trust me, they're actually being very un-American." - This is the one he got "right" though he actually guessed the thinker wrong, and the real "thinker" was David Duchovny.  "He who trusts all falls victim to men; he who trusts none falls victim to himself." All me.  "Doubt is part of all religion. All the religious thinkers were doubters." Not famous really, but Ishaac Bashevis (Polish-American writer, "The Admirer," "Alone in the Wild Forest")  Actually, making up quotes was quite difficult. I'm glad my work payed off.  After I wrote this mornings quote, my little cousin came over. He played Morrowind while I played his Pokemon Sapphire. Now I'm hooked. I need some more Pokemon. I sold my own a long time ago. I really need it. Bad. The end.
