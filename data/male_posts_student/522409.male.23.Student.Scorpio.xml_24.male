I'm not going to get all sentimental and weak.  I'm pissed.  Really fucking pissed this time.  And to hell with the Boston Ballet, too.  Picked a bad fuckin' week to mess with my friend, y'bastards.  The boat's great, though.  Workin' a lot, lovin' it... new apartment's amazing.  As soon as I get over my deeply-rooted fucking hatred, I'll be able to fully enoy it.  No.  I'm fine.  Really.
