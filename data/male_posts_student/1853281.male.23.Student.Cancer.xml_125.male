Almost two days of sun so far, after rain for like 20 of the past 22 days or so(note to self, abandon all hope of moving to pacific northwest. Rain and cloud makes you sad) Hooray for Sun and warmer temps!!! Nothing wild and exciting going on, am trying to cut back/quit smoking and cut back on the coffee and booze, and so far am succeding. Am having only 2 cups o coffee a day, and only five smokes, and have not drank since A.V.'s birthday last sunday, which granted is only a few days, but am not doing the whole"I'm home from work, let's call anyone i can reach and drag them to the C.C. club" thing. In addition. My house is a little less out of control. I have actually been doing stuff like cleaning and picking up after myself. Crazy. My current obsession is money/cash/bling. I am really trying to stick to a budget and stop using the credit card so often, but i am so sick of being poor. Anyone want to donate to the Devin is poor but deserves nice things fund? In other news, get to meet my Dad's new girlfriend this weekend when i go down to see him. I am a little weirded out by that, but i suppose it will go okay.; But it is unfair: he is 80 and has had two wives, and he is dating someone. I am 22 and have not had a relationship go longer than five months and i am single. The world really is most horribly unfair. anyways back to work d
