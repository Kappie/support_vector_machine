Before I went to Mikey Z's on Monday I started freezing and went under a down blanket (still freezing) and feeling like I was going to puke. I was fine soon and went to rinky dink.  Later at his house I kept having the same problem. This happend a lot in the morining and I started getting a horible sore throat. Kept happining through the afternoon and I felt more like I was going to puke. Now I was feeling fine but with sore throat so I had Mikey Z and Matt M for a LAN. I started feeling sick and only played an hours worth then went to bed.   The next mornining I woke up at like 7 AM and drank coffee feeling reeeaally bad. I sujested the doctors and my Mom called me in. Thankfuly we got in right when they opened and got out within an half hour. When I got back Mikey and Matt where in bed so I played counter-strike and they woke up.   That same day I felt very bad all day but today I am totaly fine! My only problem is this freaking snot and in the first half a bit of a sore throat (now I am basicly fine).  So thats that, - Jeff
