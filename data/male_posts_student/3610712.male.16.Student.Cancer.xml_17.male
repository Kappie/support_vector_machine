So then we hung out for awhile, cleaned up my room, etc. Then Eric, Luke, and an avocado showed up. Eric made guacamole then we played in my family room unplugged while Luke's new video camera recorded it all. It was a trip, to say the least. Then Eric had to leave at midnight, so we brought out Tony Hawk Underground and played Playstation for a good while. Eventually, Sarah fell asleep whilst constricted in my embrace and Luke pretty much passed out unexpectedly. I was left alone, so I did what every young white male does...I watched Blade. After that was over, I alerted Sarah that she should take Luke home, so she did. Consequently she went home, too. That was last night. Today I woke up at 11 am and my mommy got me Taco Bell for breakfast. Good times. Thank you. Bye.
