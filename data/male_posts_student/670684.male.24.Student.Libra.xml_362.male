Slept way in, started the day with a bottle of Shiner, and am getting a massage in 11 minutes from University Health Services.  $24 for 30 minutes...great price, and not from some student.    Walked into Jester for the first time in five years today...actually, it's almost five years to the day, as I was in Jester on April 3 and 4, 1999 with Katie Carnahan.  The student store is closing, and there's a sushi bar now, but it's still got what every college dies to have -- vibrance.  Professors walking around drinking Starbucks, freshman hitting on girls way out of their league, grad students huddled together around pillars for wireless internet.  I grabbed a small notebook for film ideas and a bottled water, making extended eyes with Sarah, the hot cashier.  Bryan was the open cashier, though, and he filled my order, taking several minutes to grab himself a bag of chips while I waited.
