There are the youngsters who normally go to bed well before their parents get home. The sitting comes into play after bedtime. Basically after putting them to bed I grabbed a soda and some other snacks out of the fridge, and told the kids if they needed anything that I would be downstairs. I headed down to watch TV, drink, eat (and be marry) and got paid to do it. I was there from about eight to a bit after twelve, and walked away with three crisp twenties in my back pocket ( that is about $15 an hour in comparison to hy-vee $5.75 an hour) . All in all I don't think I'll mind the next time I get called to babysit by them.  Kramer, Out!
