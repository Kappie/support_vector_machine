So here's today:  Math: stupid review  Band: watched Ferris Buehler's Day Off  English: the book Fahrenheit 451 is getting a bit better  After school: wanted to sleep, then the concert. It rocked, and we also determined something thats going to replace the lock-in that's not happening on the 30th. PARTY AT BREN'S!!!! Oh yeah....all RANDOM members are invited, must get invitation to come, not open to public. And if anyone wanted to know, I also bought 2 stems of Stargazer Lilies at the florist last night.  Well, I gotta go sleep-I've been so deprived the last few days, throw in a few concerts, playing the trumpet (I fasted for today), plenty of homework to keep me busy, etc. Oh, and my dad has no sense of aesthetics whatsoever-he got a brownish-purple rug for out living room. On top of that, its got a latex bottom, which is horrible for the wood floors. Geez...
