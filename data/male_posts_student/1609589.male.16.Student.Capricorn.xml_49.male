Here is a list of some that have bothered me in the past:  Represent! Word. Rock on. Pimpin. Yo. Dog. Dogg.  They don't mean anything! I mean, where, when and why did Dog replace "man" or "Yo" replace "hey?"  There are more than what i listed(and I know I put Dog twice, get a life), but the only time i ever really think about them are when they are said. So, if you think of any, send me an IM and pitch em to me, if I decide they're good, i'll post em here.  Todd, if you're reading this, i didn't goto TGC for a couple reasons.  1. possibility of CS whore infestation 2. All the fat-asses who sit in the chairs there break em 3. I have to save my money for the BMG concert.  Speaking of which, I REALLY need to buy those tickets, TODAY!!! If you want to go, call me NOW!!! I won't have this number posted for long, but call me @ 972-650-8456 if you wanna go! it'll end up being about $33 bucks a person. AND we get good balcony seats! HURRY!!!
