His new idea was that victory can not be obtained just by the will of power, creating attacks when there are no justified reasons to do so. Instead, attack is the logical consequence of the accumulation of small advantages obtained in the previous moves. These advantages included better development, more space, better pawn structure, pair of bishops, etc.      Steinitz was the first to understand that Chess has important constraints to creativity. It has a rigid internal logic, and only by understanding this logic is it possible to win a game against strong players.  He demonstrated the importance of these points of view both in his substantial writings and in his games. Steinitz's development marks the starting point of chess systematics. Before Steinitz, Chess theory was at most a collection of tricks, especially tactical opening variations.     With Wilhelm Steinitz and his followers, the theory underlying not only opening, but also middlegame and endgame and, most importantly, the logical connection between the different parts of the game, began to be understood. Although Steinitz theories have been demonstrated to be only guidelines, not to be followed with closed eyes, the rules that he developed are still the backbone of modern Chess strategy.
