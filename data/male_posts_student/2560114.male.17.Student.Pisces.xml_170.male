My beach skillz r soooo rusty i jus need to get back in the flow of thingz and try to get back to the level i use to b or even better. Then at like 7:30 im goin ova to oxnard high school and practice wit the shoten girlz, mark and chris r suppose to b there, so yeah...tryin to improve every practice. Last night I jus kept playin Ocean Avenue on repeat when i was listenin to music wit my cd player, damn i love that song...later dayz.
