That's goddamn right...I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel. A free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.   I'm going to see an old mentor come Thursday, Scott Greenwood.  Scott was the old Dean of Students at Centenary, and one of the better role models I have known.  It is because of him that I have this job, though he will say that it is because of me.  I wasn't Scott's favorite student at Centenary, and he wasn't my favorite staff member, but his approach to student issues and collaboration with others is probably the best I know.  I'm very excited to see how he's doing and report how I've done.    Report...how odd.    I am in search of the penultimate coffeehouse barista.  Tonight I spent half an hour at The Blue Note, Durham's independent coffee house.  The barista was pure sexiness...adidas kicking shoes, baggy green hip-hugging pants, tattoo on the small of the back, short hair, large soulful eyes...she smiled, but she was terribly preoccupied the entire night.  I might try again, though my only free night is tomorrow, after which I'm working nights up until July 26.  Maybe she has some afternoon shifts, and while the kids are in class I can get a jaunt over and grab an americano, start conversation about Nietzche, and practice some heavy petting in the stockroom.    Big turn on - sex in the stockroom.  The idea of 16 ounce cups knocked from their utility shelf perch, falling in a dramatic 2 1/2 swan dive tuck and shamlessly adorning the floor in a pollackesque array is nothing short of erotic.  I'm sporting 3/4 chub just thinking about it.    I only gave this URL to one of the students...how quickly he passes this on to the rest of the GDI group is directly proportionate to how effortlessly I lose the respect of the chi'dren.
