Yeah, we weren't allowed to give people the finger or even reply to their heckling. I hadn't planned on it, but Chris (and others) were pissed at what they were saying. Not because they were disagreeing, but that they were cursing at us in front of all those people.  Yeah, the Casualties rock. I don't know why Hobe dislikes Bob Marley solely because he smoked pot. Actually, here is Rastafarianism in a nutshell: Rastafarians believe that Haile Selassie, the former emporer of Ethiopia, was a living god who would lead them to an African promised land. However, he died in 1975. Other aspects of their beliefs including smoking the holy herb of enlightenment, "ganja" (marijuana), every day, and wearing their hair in dreadlocks. It is a quasi-Christian movement, whom many refer to as a cult. They believe that "Babylon" (aka Whitey) changed much of the Bible to give them the power in the world. Long story short, smoking pot is a part of their religion.   I seriously am planning on doing G+B, but it is going to take a freaking long time. I'll start tomorrow, ok?  A short distinction: "Never Had to Knock on Wood" is a song by the ska band  The Mighty Mighty Bosstones . Ska is a sort of music that uses swing and reggae influences, using horns in their songs and only playing upstrokes on their guitars. Reggae is the sort of slower, steel drum music with a vague political message at times.   My dad fixed three out of my four blinkers today! Starting tomorrow, I am declaring my car 45 percent-safe for the road. This means that I'll drive to work for once, instead of John.  I believe tomorrow is Tuesday, which means half-off car washes, which means I get the Mega Wash for $3.50 at the gas station on the way to Garrison. My gaskets leak really bad so I'll make sure to bring towels with to block the water.  Song mix...once Hawkeye gets his songs in John can get a-burnin'.   Today, I woke up late in the afternoon, found myself in a foul mood, and decided to stay home. I read some, watched  Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , and cleaned my room partially.   What I plan on buying tomorrow: Gas (My first full tank in 1,050 miles!) a CD or two That Salam Pax diary about Iraq (I can't remember what it is called) Car Wash Happiness or Love, whichever is cheaper  Well, good night.
