School's pretty much over though, and I present to you  one of my favourite posts so far.  =D  Do you know Andy Rooney? If so, I feel your pain. Usually as a person gets older, they get uglier, however in this case Andy got stupider. He must have been smelling the fumes off his 200 plastic candles at his last birthday party. I just don't understand how anyone can be as brain dead as sir Rooney.  For those of you that don't know Andy Rooney, he is the rotting corpse on 60 Minutes who delivers the news that all of us are interested in. An example? Sure, I happen to have one right here;   "You can't tell much about a store from the store windows.   I'm not a window-shopper, anyway. If I go to a store, I don't stand outside looking at their windows. As a matter of fact, most people don't seem to pay much attention to the windows.   That must bother the people who do them. Stores go to a lot of trouble making their windows attractive, but they do some strange things. They try to make the mannequins look real, but then, half the time they ruin it by leaving the heads off."   - Andy Rooney (read: overpaid ass)
