Man, I'd hate to tell you this, but I kinda hate too much responsibility. Sure, I'll try to cope with upcoming events, but sometimes it just gets too much for me. Plus I got another thing on my mind today, with the help of my beloved god-ma, to bother me for quite some time. In fact, it's been bothering me for a VERY long time. I'm having second thoughts about initiating a relationship, or in short, I'm thinking of giving up on a girl I've truly loved for the past year. Whether she feels it or not, I don't really care anymore. I just cant't take the pain of loving someone and not having her feel the same for me...oh well. Put the bad things behind you and get along with life...Gee, this blogger thing is really helping me relieve some stress...=p
