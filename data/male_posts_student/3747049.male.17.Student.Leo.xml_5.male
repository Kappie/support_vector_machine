My inner child is sixteen years old!  Life's not fair! It's never been fair, but while adults might just accept that, I know something's gotta change. And it's gonna change, just as soon as I become an adult and get some power of my own.    urlLink  How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by   urlLink  Quizilla
