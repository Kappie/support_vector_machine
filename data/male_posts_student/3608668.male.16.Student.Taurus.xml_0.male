She wants to buy a new house on the west side. We looked at this one that was really nice, but she said no. It was down a gravel road, back in the sticks. We didn't even get cell phone reception, and there is no way I could live without my cell, as most of you know. Carrie called and asked if I could run to the mall with her. She had to find something for her friend's birthday. The stuff she got was really cute. I don't remember what it was, but it was cute. Carrie and I went to Chris's house for a while. He told us while we were driving that his dad died. It was really sad. He seemed to be taking it well though, which is good. Well enough about yesterday. Let's move on to today. I got up around 11 this morning. I talked to Josh for a while and then I started getting ready for my interview at the buckle. I get there and the guy interviews me and after it's over, he tells me that there are no positions available right now. What a trick! Oh well. I came home after that and got ready to go to the funeral home with Carrie and Melanie. We got there and Chris seemed to be taking it well today too. We sat with him until about 7:30 or so. We left and went driving around for a while and then ended up at his house. Carrie still won't let me take the street sign with Josh's last name on it. Melanie seemed like she was mad or upset about smoething. She was fine and happy earlier when we were making fun of the "Waltons." (inside joke between Carrie, Melanie and me). Carrie was kinda acting different toward me tonight after we left Chris's house. I don't know what I did, but she was just acting weird. Melanie seemed to think I was mad at her all night, but I really wasn't. Well, I'm gonna go. Peace out people.
