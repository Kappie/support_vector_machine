Confidence boost for me. I also got someone's number - a woman - but this isn't one of those "I got someone's number" things really. She seemed nice enough. I managed to waste absolutely all of my credit on my new phone (once again, thanks Shez) talking to her - I didn't realise phone calls costed that much! It was like a 20 minute call, which isn't much, and it cost me about Â£8. EEP. Note to self - don't be an idiot in future.  There's not a lot to do atm. The group, as it stands, won't let me join in their D+D board game, so I'm here in the music room playing on the piano, discovering how bad I actually am and blogging. Isn't that good? Anyway, though, missing Scott. We'd do Anthem and such if he was here. Thinking of that, I'm going to play that once I've finished this post, it's in my head now.  Lawa seems angry/sad, and either/or is bad, paranoia of course is setting in that it's a direct result of me in some way... um... *hugs Lawa* This is me hoping that I haven't been a wanker (ie. I haven't been me) and this has little to do with me. Knowing me the chances of that are slim. Um... sh...  Happy birthday to: Sarah for yesterday, Seb and Sam Taunton for today.  Anyhow, I'm going to go and pianise, I'll be on the ol' MSN from 5-7, hopefully.  Quote of the day: "And you ask me why I love her Through wars, death, and despair? She is the constant, We who don't care."  From   Anthem   from   Chess   Love, Jon Roskilly
