Considering that most of the people I talked to were downright AFRAID of the class and teacher (besides the fact they got C's and D's), I'm pretty happy :D :D :D  Oh, and speaking of happy things...I got accepted for the Public Defender's internship in D.C.  Got the "letter" (via e-mail) last night, gonna send back the reply today.  Now I just have to start working on my ebonics... :P  OK, back to work...
