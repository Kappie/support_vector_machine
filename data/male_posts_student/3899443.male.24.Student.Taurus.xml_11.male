This self described "Christ-haunted" band has a large cult following and is one of my favorites currently making music. They'll probably never be sold in my Christian bookstore because they're on a secular label ( urlLink Virgin Backporch ), they don't say, "Jesus loves you" in every song, and they play in bars. That's a shame because I think it's beautiful music.   Changes Come  was recorded live during their Fall 2003 tour to promote their critically acclaimed album  Ohio.  Seeing Over the Rhine in concert is always a highlight of my life, and this album comes the closest to capturing the feelings of those concerts. After I saw them last fall, I wrote in my journal, "Seeing Over the Rhine play is like going out for a couple of beers and a smoke with your best friend. You spend the night talking about everything and nothing at the same time. And for that moment, in that bar, on that corner, life makes sense." (I believe now would be an appropriate time to quote the musical  Rent,  "That's poetic; that's pathetic.")  But seriously, those of you who are fans know what my melodramatic prose are attempting to say. In a world where sub-par singers like  urlLink Ashlee Simpson sell 398,000 albums  in their debut week, bands like Over the Rhine are a message from God reminding us that the entire music industry has not gone to hell.  You can only  urlLink order  Changes Come   through the band's website, where you can also pick up  Ohio  or other Over the Rhine projects ( Good Dog, Bad Dog  is another personal favorite).
