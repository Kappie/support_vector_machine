In the process I realized that I actually am some form of a music snob because I can't just simply put Bob Dylan in the top 5, I have to qualify it by saying from 62-71 or that best guitarist needs to be broken down into proficiency and have a seperate list for most influence.  Top 5 songwriters is also difficult because if you want to have John Lennon on the list, then McCartney also has to be there as well right.  And Top 5 albums have to be broken down into several catagories.  I'll post my findings later.     PS  My first job out of college is going to be picking up golf balls and working a cash register.
