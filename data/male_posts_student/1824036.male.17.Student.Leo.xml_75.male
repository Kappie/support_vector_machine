So I dragged my sorry self out of bed and showered, etc. Then my mom tells me that there are some cans to cash in! Hooray!!! I gathered up all of the cans in my car and headed to  urlLink Hy-Vee  to cash in the cans.  Dang it! It was full of about 8 Mexicans (no I do not me Mexicans to be racist) with garbage bags full of cans. So I decided to go to Jadie's house and chill out. While I was there we weighed our deciscions on what we could do for the day. We decided to just sit on her nice couch and watch some TV. We watched some college football. Iowa vs. Iowa State. Iowa won, but I dont care cuz that game means nothing to me.  After that we went down and cashed in the cans. I got $7 and some odd change with it I think. I of course got all of my money in ones so that I could enter it at  urlLink Where's George . So we get back to Jadie's and pick up her niece Kayden and babysit for her til Jadie's mom came home. By now it is about 4:00 in the afternoon.  We decided on homemade pizza for dinner, but Jadie's mom needed some pepperoni. So I took Jadie and Kayden to my house and got some really good, all beef, pepperoni. While I was there I also picked up my modle car that I had been putting off working on for a little over a year. It was a  urlLink 1960 Chevy Custom Fleetside Pickup Truck. Really really nice looking truck !  We painted most of it without any assembly for simplicity sake. I need a blue color for the engine though. Or maybe I will modify it and make the engine a different color like red or something. After about an hour and a half of painting we got tired and decided to go watch the Nebraska game. Nebraska won. Then I went home.  I had a GREAT day yesterday!!!
