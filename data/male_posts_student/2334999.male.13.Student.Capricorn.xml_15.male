Then when school ended, there was some trouble. SYY didnt sign the CMR for assembly. She only signed MT but not the one at the TOP.  Heh, Ben and me wanted to forge the signature but thought better of it... So we decided to go to MA Rm5 and tell the prefects on duty (CMR). But guess what, there were NO prefects, they all went for some meeting at the concert hall/drama theatre... Bah, so in the end, we just arrowed the signature from MT to Assembly... Nothing else we could do anyway... Then right after that, we had sci remedial... After waiting for like 30 minutes, then did Eric Loh arrive... And there were only TWO (2) of us in the sci class... Sheesh... Bleaurgh... And here I am ranting about today just for the helluvit...
