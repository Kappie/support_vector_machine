I suddenly heard an movie preview type of voice and was reminded of Pablo Francisco's bit about previews. The movie was being hyped as some bad-ass apocalypse movie and I was thought,  "Eh, whatever. Doesn't even sound that great, even though the announcer has a great voice..."  So the advert goes on, I listen, watch, absorb. It gets more bad ass. I heard quite a few screams of terror typical to apocalypse movies. Cool.  Then all of a sudden, I heard this: "This presentation is brought to you by Sara Lee deli meats."  Awesome. Less deli meat, sooner.
