I got her a diamond ring and a picture I took. She got me  "The Truman Show"  on DVD (Jim Carrey is my favorite actor) and a little Mario doll (yes, like the one Sam got me, except not Donkey Kong). I have had a pretty good overall day. I played a little SSX 3 in the morning and I watched The Family Guy when I got home. I have a birthday party to go to (my best friend Grant is turning 17) tomorrow and I will probably not be online much, like I was today. I feel weird typing in a journal that I haven't used forever. Maybe people will start flocking back here when they see that I am getting active again.  I have a lot of nothing planned for this week. Sometime on Wednesday (Christmas Eve) we are going up (down; whatever direction it's in) to my Nana's house in Merced. Christmas day my grandmother, grandfather and maybe his wive (my blood grandmother and grandfather are divorced and he is remarried) are coming down. One "big" "happy" family. On New Year's Eve Dominique is coming over for who knows how long.   Anyways, that's all for now. If the number 2 pencil is the most popular pencil in the world, why is it still number 2?
