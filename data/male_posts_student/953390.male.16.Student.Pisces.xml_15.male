It's nice having my iChat buddy list with names again! - I'm phreaking out over State Congress! I haven't had time to think about my Senior Board induction, and next week I will be busy bee working on the physical presentation. Then the next week I will be polishing the nuances, etc, of the new speech. I think I will be moving the concentration from Blogging for personal use to journalistic purposes. And, since I can run Keynote now, you KNOW it will be so much more professional. I'm taking my image to white on black (I'm such a fan of that now, I think I have too many Apple  Miyake influences). I'll be using Gill Sans instead of Myriad Pro, strangely. It'll look good when I'm done with it. I'm sweating bullets over it. It's my baby! - Next week I shall commence the networking. I need to arrange a UPS pick-up of my suit from Rock Eagle, pick a new jersey nickname (apparently the pinky/stinky combo Laura and I have can be construed as pervy), and pay for my summer events. - I still have to pick up my report card and 2004-2005 schedule from the high school. Like I WANT to be reminded of this past year. I'm really afraid Russell tried some retribution on false pretenses with my grades this 6-weeks. Also, I'm a little worried about my Drama exam hurting my semester grade. (DAMN my scene partner! Can't do anything right!) I still can't believe she blamed her forgetting lines on   ME!
