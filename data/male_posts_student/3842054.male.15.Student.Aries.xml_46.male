It sucks kind of. Lunch at 10:43.. wow... well, at least its still the longest lunch in the county! Yeah, so I'm waiting anxiously for MY personal schedule.  Last night I set up a music video story board. I did it to the song "Carve your heart out yourself" By Dashboard Confessional. First I'll post the lyrics. Then I'll try to give a link to the actual song. Then I'll type up my Story board for you.   Carve your heart out yourself Dashboard Confessional  Carve your heart out yourself Hopelessness is your cell Since you've drawn out these lines Are you protected from trying times?  Man it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she has Lord it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at all Oh Lord, now, there you go with hope again Oh, you're so sure I'll be leaving in the end  Dig a ditch deep enough To keep you clear of the sun You've been burned more than once You don't think much of trust  Man it takes a silly girl to lie about the dreams she has Lord it takes a lonely one to wish that she had never dreamt at all Oh Lord, now, there you go with hope again But I'll be sure your secret is safe with me Oh, you're so sure I'll be leaving in the end Treating me like I'm already gone  But I'm not, I will stay where you are always I will stay, I will stay, I will stay (all of now)  [repeat to fade out]  Sorry, cant find streamline music for you to connect to. DOWNLOAD IT OR BUY THE CD!    Storyboard  0:00 - 0:23 - Man sitting down on a chair, arms on knees looking down at floor. 0:24 - 0:30 - Man looks up into camera, gets up and starts to walk out of corner. 0:31 - 0:40 - Looks at girl in sleeping bed 0:41 - 0:52 - Boy lies on bed, and looks at girl. Camera view from high angle. 0:53 - 0:59 - Girls eyes open - look at where boy was, but hes not there. 0:59 - 1:07 - Sits up and puts hands on face. 1:08 - 1:20 - Scene change, make smooth transition, now at school, sitting in cafeteria talking with friends. 1:21 - 1:36 - Watches boy cross cafeteria out the doors as she sighs 1:37 - 1:48 - Boy looks through glass door at girl, the girl is not paying attention to him. 1:49 - 1:53 - He walks away, and she looks at where he was. 1:54 - 2:05 - Girl looks at friends, gets up and runs out of cafeteria. 2:06 - 2:11 - Girl running, face, feet... 2:12 - 2:15 - Girl catches up and grabs boy by shoulder 2:15 - 2:22 - They look into each others eyes. 2:23 - 2:44 - She turns around and visualizes other guys telling her they will stay - maybe 2 of them. 2:45 - 3:39 - UNDECIDED.   Well, that is a basic storyboard i created. My own format, my own material. Its not that good really. When you just look at the words, it seems very boring. BUt i hope to catch some good angles and camera shots that make it deeper and more visually tasty than that... ^. Again, I created that listening to the song once, only pausing where i needed to pause to catch the time marks. Im not even sure what the meaning of the song is. That up there will almost definatly be changed. Gonna make it with Ryan if he wants to. Well, I'll post later. Hopefully. Maybe.  Im in the making of another story board - another DC song, "Bend and Not Break"
