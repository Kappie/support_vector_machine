       
      Today was really boring.  I didn't have to go into work because it wasn't busy, which sucks because I need money and I need to see when I work for the rest of the week. Oh well, I can just go in early and look, I guess.  I hate work. And I hate Sarah. And I hate Kim. And I hate Chris. Why don't I just quit?  My life needs to become more exciting. I don't do anything, and I'm getting restless.  But for once I'm not at all looking forward to school.
