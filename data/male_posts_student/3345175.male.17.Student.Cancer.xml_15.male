An incident occured a little while ago, which i wont discuss because its not my place to discuss it, but it left Emma as emotionally bruised and battered as she was physically.  I've always tried to be there for her. I've made as big an effort as i could've made, or so i thought. Turns out, i wasnt helping - just offending her. She's posted a lot of stuff surrounding the event on her own blog, whose addy i cant give you, and with it some things i said that she misinterpreted as me doubting her or claiming to understand what she's going through.  I love this girl. I truly do. I would give up my life for her. And now it turns out she deep-down hates me because she thinks im that arrogant and insensitive. And now i think i might be too. When i said "if you're making any of this up i'll fucking kill ya" it was said in a jokey tone, with jokey intentions. Even she laughed after it. But for some reason she thinks it was me telling her i didnt trust her.  I told her on Friday i was still worried for her, and that we could all still see she was scared and hurting...and i must be doing something wrong when i speak because she took that as being along the lines of "i understand what you're going through".  But i am worried about her. I'm worried about her because she hasnt been able to resume a proper social life. Shes been off school so much her original reason for moving to Scotland from Canada has sort of been demolished, since she'll end up having to resit certain exams for courses she's missed half of. She can't trust even those who are there for her, and that doesnt hurt us. We understand that she doesnt trust us, and cant. It doesnt stop us being there for her.  But now i think it would be a better method of helping her through things by just not opening my mouth around her. I thank God she didnt hear half of what was said when people turned against her, or she wouldnt trust anyone ever again. I dont think even i could after hearing what they said.  I love her. I want to be there for her. But i dont wanna hurt her anymore by being there for her. Turns out the original idea of not tip-toe-ing around her has backfired, because instead of her feeling better because at least something has remained constant, it woulda been better if some of us in particular had changed.
