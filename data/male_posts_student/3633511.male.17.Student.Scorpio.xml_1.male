We started off batting and scored 177 in our 20 overs, for yours truly it was a lowly return of 14 but our star was Eddie Cleator once again with 97*. St. Johns were always on the back foot after that and it showed as they put up a great fight to get to 138 all out, but they were never really in the game.   Tommorrow the B team play Valkyres in the Blincoe cup second round, a win would be great and put us in with a real chance of success this year. I hope to continue some good form with the bat lately and make a contribution, but as long as the team win I will be happy.   Not much else to say today, the rest of the day has been pretty boring to be blunt, but they can't all be great. Anyway, that's today's entry finished....Chow....
