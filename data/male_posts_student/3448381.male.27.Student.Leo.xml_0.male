No we are not the only pilots of the car, but think of how much further and the interesting places you can visit with a co-pliot that can actually drive...  No time?  Time is relative! Time is all around us!  "Time is on my side...yes it is!" -Rolling Stones  Pierce the matrix and make time.  But we must wake up first Neo.  My pre, during, and post wedding thoughts go un recorded in my beautiful leather bound journal collecting dust in the roach infested bedroom furniture currently being used as my living room furniture.  Ink is drying up and not being scrolled like some ancient manuscripts.  So I figure, let's start our writers club again.  This is a call of transformations...from the carefree "woohoo!"-ers we were to the argumentative, intropsective, interrupting "Ehqumi!" we would like to become again.  Pick a day, any day, and make it yours.  We eagerly await Tuesday's for a bit of Chaunscience or Wednesday's for Dj Meli Mel or whatever...  It's the only way to keep our sanity.   See you next tuesday...  Chaunsee
