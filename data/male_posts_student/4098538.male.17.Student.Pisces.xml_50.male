I like to think we can make it through anything (as we have done so far), but now that's kinda changed. Don't get me wrong, I do want Mandy...  I want nothing else. But I am just working on hope rather than belief this time around. I would hate myself forever if I let what we have just fall apart. I can't give up on us.
