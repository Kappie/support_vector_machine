It's sad that anyone can live that way.    but now you're more of a basketball, boys just pass you around, bounce you hard on the ground, and  dribble . And we all get high fives. You think I'm an asshole now, and you're probably right....Still I hope you get everything that you care to possess, and ubelievable sex, with him, or any one of my friends.    This is a slow Halloween, not nearly as many trick-or-treaters as usual. Must be the temperature outside.   I don't really have anything to say. I have two and a half hours to get rid of this headache before Kylie calls.
