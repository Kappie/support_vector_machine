Despite Misha's best efforts, it's incredibly difficult to annoy me in any way, shape or form. However, one thing absolutely must end. Tonight.  I can't even explain my blind hatred for this phenomenon, or exactly what it is. Maybe someone can express it better than I can. It's nicknames. Yes, nicknames. I don't hate the people with the nicknames, or the nicknames themselves. Maybe it's the people who give the nicknames. I don't really know. Some don't tick me off, some make my blood boil.  "Termie" - Whenever someone says this, i get a vivid mental image of thousands of termites with little Conor heads all writhing in a nest deep in a piece of old, wooden furniture. Is it really that fucking hard just to say "Terminator"?  "Meatball" and "Sandwich" I'm not even sure who these nicknames belong to. I think one of them might be Justin. I'm so angry right now, I can't even pin down what I hate about them. Maybe it's the fact that they sound so incredibly artificial and forced. It sounds like they were named by a corporate focus group, trying to be "cool."  This sub-par entry disappointed me. I think you really deserve something better after all these days of silence. Remind me to make it up to you guys with obsessive posting this summer.       info.link:  urlLink http://www.popvssoda.com/countystats/total-county.html
