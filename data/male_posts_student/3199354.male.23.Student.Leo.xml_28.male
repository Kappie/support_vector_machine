So I have this lull here. So much up and coming, just need to TCOB first. Opportunities don't last forever, and neither does youth. Even memories fade. Its about time. Haha.  I love that static energy, that connection, the unexplainable lust of a good lil group. Non-competitive collaboration makes beautiful things. Those words ain't as beautiful as the nymphs they insinuate. Life ain't always pretty, but it can be...just work and wait. We will see it again.  Fuck the past. Fuck you all. I know what I need and I know the life for me. Y'all's is fucked. Too bad for you. Everything alive is for me, no molding myself to another's life, no getting old too quick for me, no feeling dirty all the time for just being me. I am everything you could never be.   What's on the Dell?  Jay-Z,  Lucifer    Man i gotta get my soul right I gotta get these Devils out my life These cowards gonna make a nigga ride They won't be happy til somebody dies  Man i gotta get my soul right 'For i'm locked up for my whole life Evertime it seems it's all right Somebody want they soul to rise (I'll chase you off of this Earth)   Preach, Jigga.
