Mistake Number 1:  Ordering people around.  Mistake Number 2: Asking for pickles, more specifically, dill pickles.  Because I get my sandwhiches as asked, but I get fucking sandwhich pickles.  The SWEET PICKLES.  WHY?!?!!?  Does god hate me??  Its like I specifically asked for dill, but I get the complete opposite.  WrathS 01: DONT YOU HATE SANDWICH PICKLES??!?! WrathS 01: they are dill pickles' bitch. SupraBoost89: yeah so annoying WrathS 01: pickles arent supposed to be sweet, get it right  But see, I'm lazy and ordered my mom around which is a bad habit.  Haven't done it in a while.  And plus, look, I'm whining about my freakin sandwhiches because my life is actually pretty good right now.  No bad things to whine about.
