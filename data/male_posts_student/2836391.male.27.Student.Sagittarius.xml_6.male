From where I was at the start of the year, married, and in a job I really enjoyed, to the end, separated, and training for a totally new career, via a huge emotional roller coaster, which still continues.  Even now, I still have days when I feel really down, days when I want to crawl into a hole and hide from everyone. On other days, I feel fine, happy and secure, and looking forward to the challenges and events in store for me this year. At the moment, the good days pretty much outnumber the bad, but some weeks it is a close game.  The thing that has kept me going through the tough times, as well as my reliance on God, is some very close, and very understanding friends. It took me reaching a real low point to realise how much my friends cared, and that had I just told them how I was feeling, they would have been there for me.  Now, I can't go more than I day without contacting people, before someone will call and ask how I am, or drop round. At first this annoyed me, I thought "I don't need them to check up on me all the time", but then I realised that it was because they care, and don't want to lose me.  The best friends though, are the ones who are there when I need to talk, or want some advice, but who also know when I just want some space to myself. The ones who don't claim to know how I'm feeling, don't tell me what I need to do, or what they think I need to hear, but who listen, accept that today I am sad, tomorrow I may be angry, and who knows how I'll feel by Wednesday!  I am fortunate to have friends who are like this, and I thank them, and God, that they are who they are, and that they care.
