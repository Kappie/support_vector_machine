I was the skinny, depressed kid with the red hair and freckles who was always alone. Well, you didn't see that much. When I was really getting a big part, by folding a piece of paper into a boat. I fucking suck at folding. And the with the camera was, like, "Can I get a shot of this?", I was thinking, "Fuck, yeah!". So he got a good, clean shot of me.  When I got home, I missed it.  A couple months later, my teacher showed the tape in class. And I was fucking cut outta it! They got a little shot of my face. CHANNEL 5 NEWS CUNTS! And that's how I nicknamed myself "Papercut", because I was folding a a piece of paper and they fucking cut me out. Get it?
