Royale is an official Microsoft theme taken from Windows Xp Media Center Edition 2005 Build 2149. It is in fact the first theme after XP Betas in about 3 years. This theme comes with the new Media Center Edition beta, and will probably come with the actual release.   urlLink      I posted this so that everyone would know what I was talking about when the link on the site happens to go down. It might clear stuff up when people want to know what theme that is in my desktop if someone goes back one year and looks through it.   One thing you might want to note, is that this is an officail theme and will not need any .dll patches to run. If by chance you did not want to become a member of Flexbeta but want it, check out this link-  urlLink here .
