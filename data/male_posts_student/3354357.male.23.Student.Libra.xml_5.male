Maybe he was racist or just enjoyed saying extremely stupid and uneducated things (which would be funny because he had a Masters in Divinity). This is the gem that came out of his mouth: "I can't believe it. Black people are faster, funnier, and way more athletic. I think they where put on this earthto entertain us." This is by far one of the stupidest things that came out of anybodies mouth. His attitude toward black people is reflected in his youth group. Out of 200 kids, there is maybe 4 or 5 black kids. mmm, but thats funny, none of them are singing or doing any other form of entertainment. I guess they aren't the side-show thathe thought they were.
