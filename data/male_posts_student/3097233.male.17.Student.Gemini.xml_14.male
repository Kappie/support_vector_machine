The doctors can try and rush to find a liver but you might not live long enough to have a transplant and even less of a chance to have a donor liver available. The chance of survival is slim but cloning can make those chances much better. With the ability to culture and raise organs and body parts there could be a quick match to your liver and the transplant could be a success, with possibly an even better acceptance from your body to the new organ.  Cloning is a subject that most feel strongly for or strongly against. Those again cloning claim that it is unlawful, unethical, and may even halt human evolution. Though those for cloning see it as a possibility for a huge leap in medical fields, in better economy, and even a way to have a loved one that was take by infant death or by premature death from a car crash, a disease, or other misfortunes.  There are more than one form of cloning, which some do not understand. Some people tend to think that cloning is sending a person through some kind of tunnel and they come out as two different people or that they get shot with some special ‘clone gun’ and they are duplicated. Well those are true, it takes a lot for a cloning. There are types of cloning, like organ clones, human clones, animal clones, and even cloning and extinct animal. There is currently groups of scientist which are in the Siberian Tundra searching for remains of Woolly Mammoth which could produce the needed DNA for the cloning of the extinct beast. As I had said earlier there is also organ cloning.  There is also another opinion of cloning which I stand behind. This form of cloning is the same as the others, but –no- human cloning. Most religious humans feel that cloning a human is too close to ‘playing God’.  Cloning is believe that it will halt human evolution because it may deprive all diversity in DNA. This is not necessarily true because if cloning is used to create ‘ideal’ animals, excluding humans, then diseases that effect humans like Mad Cow Disease, Scrapie, Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis, and Creuzfeld-Jacob Disease. These diseases affect animals which in turn effect humans because of the meat is eaten of the animal, milk is drank by the animal, or the genes are passed on and the disease will spread costing more resources and putting more humans at risk.  If animals like cows or pigs were cloned and then used for meat and other products then scientists could help to design a group of ‘prefect’ animals which would be able to produce meat, milk, and other products, which would be far superior to the items which are currently used because the genes which designate the quality of meat and other items that come from the animal would be made to extreme quality. Milk that could fulfill the calcium needed in just one glass, or have just one six ounce steak which would contain the protein and other beneficial vitamins and minerals so that the human body would become stronger.  The first creature to be cloned was Dolly, the lamb. Dolly was the first successful cloning and took around 277 egg cells injected with DNA to produce Dolly the Sheep. It is believed that for humans, with 10,000 eggs injected with foreign DNA that three would be able to make it to adulthood. Because there has been no proof of a human clone these numbers are just educated guesses.   Cloning has become a topic of debate with if it should be legal or not. Cloning should be allowed to be studied and understood so in case there is a time of need the information will be ready and remember, if you were the one laying on that hospital bed in pain, would you want to have to wait and see if they could find a match for you or have a readily cloned organ waiting in case of an accident like this?
