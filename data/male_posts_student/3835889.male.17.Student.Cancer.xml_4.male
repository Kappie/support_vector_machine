Anyway if u all still don't know, my birthday actually falls on racial harmony day as well as international friendship day...Hahaxz my friends out there, i dun mind abt having any presents anot but i do think that the most important thing for a true birthday present is sincerity. Without it, giving a present is oso useless.     Anyway, today hasbeing a great day...its my dads birthday! Lol and i drove every1 out for brunch together ( breakfast and lunch together). Actually i got nothing much to say abt today 'cause its a sloooow moving day. Kinda bored actually. Guess the best part of everything was that i got 2 bottles of Loreal Paris products for free! Hahaxz its actually because the cashier made a mistake charging my product, which is US$8.09 each and has to refund me $17+ back, as well asgiving me theproducts FOC! Hahaxz this is the system in US. If they make a mistake, they will hav to give the products to us, FOC as well as refund the full amount of money. The reason is simple: we can actually sue them for charging us the wrong price.That meansif i bought a bike here and was charged wrongly, they will hav to refund me and give me the bike FOC!Lol i do love US...hahaxz.Btw i hav to sleep soon, 'cause tomorrow early morning i will be having my 3rd and 4th driving lessons...Good night everybody!
