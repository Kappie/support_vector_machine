I was worth it not only for the smilies, but now I know I can modify my forum to the way I want it.  Next I'm adding a calendar and voting polls.  Last night we went to "The Big Steer"  Mmmm, it's supposed to be a steak house but we got onion rings and fish :)  I get the left over for lunch today.  Should be better than the peanut butter and jelly from yesterday.  It's raining and raining.  We actually had flood warnings yesterday.  I can't wait until it gets warmer so I can start working on my fish pond again.  Last year I was at the pet store and they had a grocery cart full of water plants.  I asked how much the whole cart would be and they gave me like 75% off with a managers discount of like 10% so the whole cart was around 15$ when the plants themselves are around $5 a piece.  So my pond will be a swamp with so many plants... I have a sweet plan drawn up of how I'm going to do it.  I'll show some pics of before and after later on this summer.  Speaking of pictures, here's some pictures of me and Brian unloading that HUGH power supply.
