Scanned a picture into photoshop, completely forgetting the fact that I haven't used it for about a year and a half, thinking that I could easily fuck with it...No dice...I am more than a little rusty. So much so that I completely forgot about layers, the most fundamental element of photoshop. I only realized this after I worked the clone stamp and fucked up and couldn't undo it because after I had smudged the shit out of it on the same layer as the drawing. Blah. So I just rescanned and posted it without any altering besides cropping it.   Square CDs are the coolest thing ever to have existed and they are even cooler when they are three minutes long. Although mummified baby rabbits come in a close second. It's sitting on my TV staring at me with its tiny dehydrated eyes. Kind of half expecting it to come to life in the middle of the night and go berserk for disturbing its eternal slumber by stabbing me with a pencil and reciting curses from the necronomican.
