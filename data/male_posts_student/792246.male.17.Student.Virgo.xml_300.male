You know what this all means?  All this new stuff makes me want to *dum dum dum* do spring cleaning! Of my blog that is. I plan to do a few things.  1) Delete posts that are just broken links and/or quiz results. If other posts are seriously devoid of any content, they go too.  2) Add titles to all the old posts. Titles were added sometime in 2003 I believe, so a lot of the early entries don't have them, and they are teh ugly.  3) Because this would be boring otherwise, I'm going to add in fun little italicized commentary on old posts! Yaay! >_  In other news, Dream Elisheva made Dream Bun-Bun smoke, and he suffered the wrath of instant karma.  UPDATE: Complete through the end of 2002.
