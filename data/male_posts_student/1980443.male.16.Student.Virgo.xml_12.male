I would definately be batman or something cool like that.  Man he kicks some major joker..... He fights all the dudes, and he's got cat girl for a sidekick, can't get much better than that.  Batman rocks the house until it falls down, he wears this black cape thing, and I am so jealous - Let's get Yogurt!    That's how we do things round herrrrre.  I'm Will - see ya'll later.
