ESCAPISM IS THE WAY!! woohoo! (Who am I trying to kidd)   Spoke to my friend today. Apologized profusely for being a jerk and a screw up. They always say that things will never go back to the way it was before. I will never understand that. I don't work that way. I'm not confrontationalist.  Many thanks to all my readers. Almost make me feel better. Almost. Will get advice on how to improve the look of this page so that you guys have a more pleasant read. AnonymouS = Shane Ng maybe? Keep tagging boys and girls! Interaction is key!  At about 10 I got out of the shower and did 1 pull-up and got shocked as hell coz it only hit me after I did it. I screamed at my mom and did another one! Bought a $140 box of 18 servings of Myoplex and another bottle of amino acid pills... I'm a druggie! So exciting! Time to get big and stay that way. Not coz girls like jocks though. I choose to pursue more objective objectives. It's for my career thing. Being a artiste is hard work. AND YES! I WILL BE AN ARTISTE! WITH THE "E" AT THE BACK COZ IT'S CLASSIER! HUMPH!  I've still got 40 pages of reading to do for Geog test tomorrow and it's 1250 already. Die. Oh btw, my long awaited meeting with the producer is coming. Apparently Sidney Tan's been commissioned to be the music director for Idol. He'll hook me up.  I love you guys.
