I dont care if it's a wonderland, or if he's bigger than it gives him credit for, or if it makes him contort when he sings to the point that he looks as if he's taking a dump in his pants.  The latter is probably the only thing he hasn't actually written lyrics about, but have you seen the guy sing?  C'mon John, you're not good enough to be pulling off the weird facial expressions and look pained by your music as you sing about running through the halls of your HIGH SCHOOL.  Not bitter.  Next subject, no cable.  I haven't had cable for like 7 months now.  I think I need it back.  I'm missing so much, it's like I need to somehow acquire a TIVO that lets me view everything I've missed in the last several months.  Guy Ritche and Madonna apparently don't watch TV in order to avoid hearing negative things about themselves.. maybe I'm like that.  Except no one talks about me on TV.. at least not often.  Hey Lauren remember at number nyne how that one person was a recurrent caller and was paranoid and thought that the TV was talking to him/her/it?  I mean i never received that caller, but hell, no one received calls there.    For everyone else- Number Nyne is a crisis hotline we 'volunteered' at for a few whiles.  No one calls.  If I were getting ass raped by a gorilla in an alley, i wouldn't call a student-run hotline number, would you?  911 is entirely a lot easier to dyle than __ __ __ - NYNE.  (did u like how i spelled "dial" as "dyle"  just to prove that it's an annoying spelling.  Kinda like people who have business that are labeled things like "Kids Korner"  or "Krazy Kat's Kennel"  or ... yeah, you get the idea.    I said this looks like a job for me, so everybody just follow me..   sorry just singing.  AOL radio rocks my world, it's just nice to be able to flip around from 80's to soundtracks to.. hell... Kwanza Holiday Tunes if you want.. why not.  I should study, test in Retailing Management in abour an hour.  Retailing Management?  Are you serious?  Why is this class offered in the marketing department.  Everyone knows that the managers of retail outlets don't need college degrees.. just gotta work urself up from "sales associate" and that takes like, 30 min.  K, now i've offended anyone who's a manager with a degree from Columbia who might be reading this (what are the odds of that... i mean someone reading this that is).  Ciao
