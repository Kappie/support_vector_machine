Also, they believed in no exceptions for abortions.  Then, some of them changed their minds, and decided abortions were wrong  except  when the life of the mother is in danger.  Later, they changed their minds again and decided fetuses were human beings  except  when the life of the mother is in danger  and except   when she has been raped  and except  when she is the victim of incest.  Pro Life people can't seem to make up their minds on when a fetus is human or not.    Anyways, I decided that if this amendment is passed Pro Lifers (and everybody else) must agree to the following terms:  1.  Everyones age will be calculated from the day of  conception  :  So, if we are human the day the egg is fertilized then that is our birthday!  After the amendment becomes a wall we will no longer count the day the baby comes out of the womb as the birthday.  Instead, we will count back 8 or 9 months to the day of conception, adding 9 months to our age.  Well, after all we are considered "human beings" to you Pro Life people on the day of conception.  This shouldn't be a problem for you.  2. Social Security #s are issued immediatly to all fetuses:  self-explanatory.  3. Capital Punishment for all women who have abortions :  A life is a life, you should get same punishment.  38 states all ready have the death penalty for premedicated murder.  So, if fetuses are "humans" than moms that have abortions should get the death penalty...isn't that right, people that believe Pro life?  4.   Doctor who performs abortion also gets capital punishment :  He is in even deeper shit cause he is murdering "humans" for profit.   If the Right to Lifers are not willing to adopt the above proposals, then is it possible, they don't  really  believe life begins at conception and the fetus is  not  a human?  Is this whole anti-abortion movement actually not about "abortion" at all?-  but instead  about  controlling women  and  their bodies  and keeping them "in their place"?  Could it be?  I'll let you to decide.  I bet you people that are Pro Life are really thinking right now...
