HOURS LATER...  went to cammies earlier. had fun with her and preston, then annalise came, and we still had fun. cammie wished that by the end of the summer we would be able to tell each other that we loved each other. i dunno if ill be able to, cuz of the tally incident. but w/e, ill figure something out. listeing to soybomb rite now, sad cuz they broke up. in 24 hours ill b somewhere in idaho, sleeping in a stranger's house. well, at least i think ill be asleep. wouldnt count on it though. tomorrow'll be my last entry for at least a week. jeez its a 2 day drive to canada. hopefully itll b fun. ill miss cammie sooo much, it wont b fun. o well, canucks r cool. most of them anyways. mmm the LIVESTRONG braclet cammie's dad gave me smells good cuz cammie put perfume stuff on it. cant stop sniffing it lol. grrr im gonna miss her lots. as soon as i get bak, im gonna b moving. well, pretty soon afterwards anyways. i dunno what ill do if i cant see cammie every day. o god i dont wanna think about that. ill fall apart. i dont think she knows it but shes such a big part of me... ill cry at least once, im sure.
