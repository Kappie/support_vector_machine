The German people are not stupid, so perhaps some of this is just a mob reaction, whipped up by a willing media and fueled by the radicals in the German society.  People tend to pile on and read everything in terms of the conclusion they wish to reach, so I can understand the outbreak of Schadenfreud.  BUt still, to read about it in such terms is disturbing.
