(Open the source code for your email, strip out the address of the generic website, i.e. www.SpamWhatAm.com, and enter it manually into your browser.) Order cases of penis powder, viagra, herbal this and that, 0.039% mortgages, whatever and charge everything to a bogus credit card, giving them a fictious person and address. Or, if you want, use a real person, like:  George W. Bush  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington, DC 20500  USA  phone: 202-456-1111  email: president@whitehouse.gov  Make up a credit card number. (Here's one: 4268-4976-6194-6633; it means I AM THE POOPY HOOFD; hoofd is Dutch for head.)  If you are charging stuff to Bush, make sure the expiration date is 01/05   Most of the web sites will verify the credit card automatically and find out the VISA card is bogus and just reject your order. Just keep trying. This will annoy the credit card companies, who will bitch to the spammers, and may shut them off to keep their system from overloading with bogus political protest orders.  Some might send an email to the White House saying George W. Bush's credit is no good.  Some of them might actually ship the stuff BEFORE processing the card. (Unlikely, but cool.)  At a minimum, you will have clogged up the spammer's invoicing and credit system with bogus orders. At a maximum, well...  And, if enough people do it on enough websites , it may be enough to get mentioned in the papers.   Email this to every blogger you know.   Yippie!
