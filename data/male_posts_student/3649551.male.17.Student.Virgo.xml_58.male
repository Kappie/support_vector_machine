I still like keeping to myself, but now I have learned to do it in small doses. I have slowly turned myself into a more social beast. And here's why: You lose your frickin mind if you don't interact with other people on your own free will. School doesn't cut it, and neither does the Internet. Eventually, you spiral into the ridiculous (yet very real) abyss of depression. Thinking too much is a problem. And people don't think. A person thinks, but people don't. This is why it is so vital for a person to spend time as a people. Okay, so people think from time to time. Small groups of people are capable of thought, at least to the extent to tell you when you're losing your mind. That's what friends are for, after all: to make sure you don't think too highly of your own fanciful ideas. An unhealthy amount of thought leads to an unhealthy lack of action. Lack of action leads to a lack of normal emotions. Lack of emotion leads to a numbness that renders even thought useless. The person becomes a shell. They lose the ability to communicate because they don't care enough to try. I don't especially know why I'm writing about this right now, other than to fill this woefully inadequate blog with material. I take it back, I'm writing about this because it happened to me once, and now I see it happening to someone else. I love writing when I'm tired. It makes me feel so much more intelligent. I'm writing stuff that would make me throw up if I was well rested. That's what the Internet is for; airing our moral prejudices, or lack thereof. That's completely unrelated to anything I just wrote, but I had a sudden impulse. I'm not one to censor myself.
