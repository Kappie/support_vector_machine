His father's voice was loud an' mean: "You won't amount to anything."   That little boy quit tryin', He just walked away. There were teardrops on his face. Tell me, how would you feel? You'd probably give up too, If nobody believed in you.   That old man said: "One more try, "I know I'm not too old to try. "I promise, son, I'll do my best, "This time, I'm gonna pass the test." "Give me the keys, Dad, an' get in." His father never drove again.   That old man quit tryin', He just turned away. An' there were teardrops on his face. Tell me, how would you feel? You'd probably give up too, If nobody believed in you.   We take His name out of schools. The lawyers say it breaks the rules. Pledge of allegiance can't be writ, An' under God, should not be said. I wonder how He will take. I just pray it's not too late.   What if God quit tryin', He just turned away? There were teardrops on his face? Tell me, how would you feel? You'd probably give up too, If nobody believed in you.   Tell me, how would you feel? You'd probably give up too, If nobody believed in you.   This is one of my new favorite songs. It's touching and shows how important to have someone support you in what ever you do. Without motivation it is hard to do well in anything. I think the saddest part in the song is the part with the old man. I don't know why, but I guess it was the music video that did it. The son looked so mean, and the old man looked so sad, it just got to me. The other sad part is the beginning with the little boy. I've played little league, and I'm thankful that my dad or coach wasn't that way, if they were I'm not sure how I would have turned out. Joe Nichols is officialy my favorite country singer, if you haven't heard of him, look him up, his songs are great.
