But the $300 ticket back to Binghamton would have sucked... not to mention Sunday would essentially be a waste... west to east flying basically results in a whole day being wasted.  I did some massive downloading last night. Bessides Interpol, I downloaded some more stuff off the  Show and Tell  compilation. I also did some resorting of my mp3s and id3 tagging. I don't know what happened to a bunch of them... their tags got removed somehow.   I need to get a lot of reading done today... I had a weird dream last night... a friend was impregnated by George Clooney.  **
