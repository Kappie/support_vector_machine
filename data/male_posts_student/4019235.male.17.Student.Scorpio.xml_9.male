Much of it was cause blogspot couldn’t work properly though.     Anybody    who wishes to go to the fireworks festival at the   Fullerton   had better get there early, last night, the entire bridge had to be locked down and cars were trapped in seas of people, that was horrible, but luckily we got a pretty good vantage point perched high on a road rail, it was pretty good. Cant help but look around at the suckers who were standing and elbowing each other. Undoubtedly we could have got a better position (we are sitting in front of a street lamp. Not good if you wanna see the full patina of the fireworks), if not for selected minorities within the group who decides to “catch the festival in its full swing” and “wandering around” to “check things out”. His exact words. Regardless, it was still a thrilling experience, though the fireworks lasted a tad too short. Well, there’s never enough fireworks anyway. Next time (meaning next week), if we decide to watch pyrotechnics again, we had better find a good place early, like 7pm, 1½ hours before the fireworks really start. Some of you reading this might find it a bit “bo-liao” camping on the bridge with 200000 people around waiting for 1½ hours to get a glimpse of the 10mins long fireworks. Not really, it was worth it actually, just hanging out with my folks.                   Anyway, that was yesterday. The day before yesterday (sounds complimentary to “the day after tomorrow” *smirk), let me think, so I was at the library settling my library records. I had intended to report the magazine lost out of library, but I decided to “voluntarily lessen” (that is , to lie), the penalty I had, so I reported the magazine I had lost at Em’s house to be lost WITHIN the library. And so they believed it, that’s a break. And they will be searching for it. This, way I had temporarily saved 16 dollars of the fine. I would just need to pay for the 10 which is charged as overdue. Then I took a straight bus to Sim Lim and visit my favourite shop (cant tell u guys sorry, cause he gives me great offers and says that he cant give everyone good offers), I had him give me the specs for an excellent gaming comp. it’s rated 9.5 overall, and the specs are: MSI 915P Neo2 Platinum motherboard, an Intel Pentium HT Extreme processor 4.2GHz that hasn’t been released until the end of the year. He advised me to get that later, it shows18% marketed increase from the present HT processors. An ATI Radeon 9800 XT, and 2 XMS PRO 1 GB Corsair RAMS. It’s like a freaking overhaul for my comp! All these new parts amount to $3800! OMG, where on this god-damn world do I get this kind of money?! So that’s y I’m putting this up for my Christmas wishlist, I doubt I could get all of them for Christmas though. Anyway, I’m looking for more solutions and maybe packages to lessen the cost.                   The day before yesterday’s yesterday I was school-bound. On the bus I was listening to my mp3, blasting away on the ear phones like nobody’s business. Apparently not, this guy from ACJC was sitting beside me and tapped me on the shoulder. I removed my earphones and he said, “Thanks for the free music” then he got off. Weird. I think I managed to reply a “you’re welcome”. But I can’t remember now. Later that day I watched I, Robot again. Sometimes when you watch a movie more than 1 time, you catch the movie more, especially the subtle details, but all these “subtle details” isn’t worth 8 bucks. Remind me not to do something like that again. So after the movie, I didn’t go to Em’s house, I was tired, so I went across the hallway and played on Jon’s Xbox, without him around to acknowledge me doing so. So I played and played, and then he got home. Remarkably, he didn’t scold me or anything. He just said “ Yesterday I was playing and I got over 75,000 in Schizophrenia” then I told him “Think my score is weak, try beating this new one I’ve set AFTER you got your 75,000” (I got 100,000 points in the half-pipe of Schizophrenia) “Man you can’t even front on that one, kid. Best go home to preschool.” I almost felt pity for him. From the looks of it, he has decided to give up on the freestyle for race events where he might actually have a chance of beating me.                   This long holiday is quite eventful, even for my Chemistry revision. Although it was only 6 inorganic topics, and of which I did the MCQ on my newly bought TYS, I had got an impressive 80%. Encouraging, yes? But hell, I haven’t got started on my Bio TYS yet. It’s BORING!  SIAN ! Worse than the other subjects. As for homework, I haven’t done any of them. That’s normal for me. As for Jon, he has started studying! I would also be seriously studying if my prelims are 1 week away! JJ prelims are so late. The syllabus is kinda slow. It seems that I have to do some reading afore.                   That pretty much sums up this weekend.
