My intent after that was to go home, pack, and be on my mary way all the way up to Nice(pronounced N-EE-ce) California. But when I got home I found that my step dad took my sis to go shop with him which wasn't good because I had to take her with me. After numerous calls back and forth I decided to leave without her so me and my brother left. I felt really guilty for leaving her so I just decided to go get some gas and go home and wait. So that's what I did. When we finally got on the road it was smooth sailing for then on out. We had our dog P-nut we had pillows and blankets and McDonald's and we were on the road we first drove to Clear Lake to meet my grandma and let me be the first to say that that road is not fun so as we swirved back and forthe through the mountains everyone in the car was sick except me and thats a first so I was happy. I went to turn into my grandma's house and the car in back of me either wasn't looking or didn't car so I had to swirve and skid to get into my grandma's house so we got up there and loaded some more stuff and then we drove here to this place in which I have to use a dial-up connection, but its ok because its really nice up here. Well I'm still just as boring but on this day I seem to have alot more to say.
