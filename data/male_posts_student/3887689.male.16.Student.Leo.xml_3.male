Well, apparently he is trying to convince people that porno is not the lowbrow entertainment that many dismiss it as, but rather, it is high art. When asked what his definition of art is, he replied, "Whatever an artist says is art." I didn't really agree with that, but I certainly couldn't come up with a better definition. I knew it was time to look in the online dictionary. And this is what I found:     art   1      urlLink      (  )     Pronunciation Key    (Ã¤rt)     n.      Human effort to imitate, supplement, alter, or counteract the work of nature.    My first thought was, as you might imagine, "What the fuck?". But then, thinking about it further, every form of art can fall under one of those categories. Imitation, certainly: paintings of flowers and animals, novels about life in the wild, aural recreations of places. Counteract definitely: there has always been a counter-culture element to art . Alter, maybe: I guess bizarre shit that people try to pass off as art would fall under this category. However, I still don't understand why he chose the word "supplement" among these. Perhaps one of you can help me out. But back to the original point, while I think this defines most art, I don't think it's a good definition.         2. The conscious production or arrangement of sounds, colors, forms, movements, or other elements in a manner that affects the sense of beauty, specifically the production of the beautiful in a graphic or plastic medium.    That seems like a much better definition to me. Only problem here is, I guess porn would fall under this definition, as much as I would hate to consider porn to be art. If you have a better definition for art, please leave a comment.    II. If you had asked me whether I believe in love at first sight a mere twelve hours ago, I would've laughed at you and probably have given you some shit like, "I believe in lust at first sight," or something to that effect. But something extremely bizarre happened to me today. I was at a restaurant, and the waitress came up and introduced herself...and I felt a weird sort of attraction to her. I don't know exactly if it was "love" per se, like the kind of love I feel for my beautiful girlfriend Sam, who I hope is not reading this right now. But it was a sort of feeling towards her where I wanted to meet her, talk to her, get to know her a little bit, become friends, and then screw her. But don't confuse this with lust, friends. I realize I just said I wanted to screw her, but not in a monkey love sort of way. More in a romantic, wine and flowers kind of way (boy, I sure hope Sam isn't reading this). I dunno. I can't really describe what I mean. Words can't really do justice to feelings.
