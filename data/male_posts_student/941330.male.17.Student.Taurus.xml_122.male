"we can't have meetings in the rotunda anymore." simran: "why?" took roll, got some spiffy shiny books, yup. chem ap, 17 kids!! we are an embarrassment to an embarrassing school. "try to remember everything you learned, because we don't have time to reteach it this year." ankur: "it's ok, we only need like, a month to learn it again anyway." lunch, we made fun of erik's offensive offense and jason for...being jason. mandarin 3, howell, i felt like such a whitewashed loser. i sorta understood her, not that it was fast but that it was too many new words. stupid freshmen think they're so bad cuz they're in high school...one of eugene's linkees kept on yelling out "your mom was good!" and gay old crap like that. we get to use tape recorders, interesting..."we're going to need to buy rice paper." eugene: "can you eat it?" art, BORING as hell, cory is strange but not to the exponential extent of miller, da. nobody laughed to his jokes but jen thinks it's just cuz our class is full of people that don't care. i like the guy's teaching methods though, his emphasis on effort and not forcing us to do anything. the kids in architecture kept laughing, i kinda want it but i don't like models. i was happy cuz art is now only 2d work, i'm not big on sculpture etc. then erik showed off his smashed finger, o0o0o0o0.  after school was fine, talked to people, simran tried to rape kevin again but failed again. i THOUGHT parisa's phone was a cameraphone, silly me. helped adam, richard b and basho bring govt. books for lafferty..."i pity the fool who gets lott for history." then saw ira and samyak off, hung out with amanda while she exercised (dedication!), then yea that's about it.
