Well, be it webpage or printed material form, it's hard to bring myself to read on political issues.  SADDENING      Have anyone ever chucked your uncompleted tutorials aside to think of this: What it should be like to be a  youth ?   Does being youthful necessarily means that we must play, joking and laugh but not work at all? I'm not really sure but certainly it's an universal truth that one has the choice to slack or work. No one shd be deemed outcast or deprived from been a true youth if the slacks whilst others mug or mugs whilst others slack. The dictationary does not give other description besides "young" to the word "youth".  There's a plan for everyone. We hardly have the power to plan ahead but we could move ahead with the plan. Ignorance is the main cause for fear in Mankind. Just live the way you wont regret at the end of the day. Don't need to be affected by others' behaviour as their effects on you are psychological.
