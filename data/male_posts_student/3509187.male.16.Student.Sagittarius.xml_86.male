We just got your 4th tonight... We opened the box... Unwraped the Microwave... Opened the Door... AND... SQWish... had to kill a spider that had taken a ride in it from China where it was assembled... Hmm yeah... a living Chinese spider.  Well I just had to write it down or I wouldn't believe my memories in a couple years...  Screwy world...  By the Way this tough spider reminds me of the one Eric, Justin, and I found at an Untitled practice... remember that gentlemen?  -Dan V
