Gifted  would be a talent-search contest that scoured the nation for the best talent, and the winner would receive a singing career under the management of Wright and Crouch.  Not only is this idea positively boring (just look at all the other "idol" imitation shows), but there are essential Christian values that will likely be compromised by  Gifted .  First, the creation of  Gifted  reminds me of an unhealthy mingling of the holy with the profane.  Much of the so-called "Christian culture" merely takes something from the world's culture and "baptizes" it in Christian external appearances, while leaving the rest of the structure in tact.  Second, as the name "American Idol" explicitly states, these talent searches intend to discover, hone, and market the next celebrity that American culture can idolize.  Third, the whole talent search contest smacks of the world's (mis)judgment.  According to 1 Samuel 16:7, "God sees not as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart."  Finally, I fear  Gifted  will focus on everything except the music.  The talk will be all about the singers personal lives, who's the hottest, and in worst case scenarios who proves to be the most "spiritual."  I wonder if there will be anything Christian about  Gifted , or if it will be  exactly  like "American Idol" with different lyrics?  My guess is that  Gifted  will be an attempt at Wright and Crouch to make money, and it will be promoted as an evangelistic tool to reach out to the world.  Most likely, people in the world will not watch it, and even if they did, I doubt they would see a substantial difference.  If reaching the world is our goal, I suggest we stop imitating the world, and we live like we should.  1 Peter 2:15 " For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men ."
