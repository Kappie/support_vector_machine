All mine are quotes from web comics and other blogs, Erins are quotes from books and movies, Nathan has something musical, I dont remember what, Michael's are quotes from the west wing, thomas is welcome to fred, Sophia has band name ideas, and I can't figure out Jonahs.  You need one that isn't any of those. Other rules: Nothing can be deleted, but you can add edits in bold to other posts. You can change the template(little quote thing on the bottom) only after the one currently in use has been there for a week, unless its a special occasion.  there are probably some minor rules I'm forgetting, but.... oh well.   I could have sworn I edited in that we were going saturday after thomas posted we were going friday...   ( I edited in Sunday because all the marching stuff is on Saturday and I can't go, so I was encouraging everyone to come Sunday --Thomas)   Im stuck between Palpatine and the skeleton. They should fight in Mortal Kombat. literaly.  That is, play against eachother in the video game.  Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...
