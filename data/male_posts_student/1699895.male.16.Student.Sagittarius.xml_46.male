The place itself is at least 3 hours away. It will be a long drive, and I hope that the weather will actually be good, because it will be boring if not!  Hagen won't even play tommarow, because he kicked this kid in the nuts (nice job, moron)  Earlier today (or yesterday, i should say) I practiced at bens.  We accomplished lots. We played a few songs, and Ojos was locked in bens room forever =( but he's ok, he is always hyper.  Now that I think about it, I can sorta portray what tommarow will be like...  12:00 - Leave 3:10 - Approx arrivial time 4:00 - The Actual Game Time 5:20 - Games 80 minutes 5:30 - Half time is ten 5:36 - give or take stoppage time 5:40 - actually start to leave 8:50 - arrive home  Yeah, so thats my day tommarow, and fortunetly, this is my last away game. We have another game tuesday home, and then next week on wednesday. The season is almost over! I am both sadden, yet relived at this, but more relieved then anything. but I must sleep, ill ttyl g's. peace  mur
