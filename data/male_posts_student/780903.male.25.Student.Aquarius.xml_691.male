She writes:  "Actually, the HLS GOP blood drive is not like the Environmental Law Society sponsoring a conference on diversity. It's like the Environmental Law Society, BLSA, the Squash Club, or the Ballroom Dancing Society adopting a family for Thanksgiving or volunteering at a soup kitchen. What creates the ridiculous impression that conservatives don't "have a lot to do with" community service? ... I am frustrated when other people consistently express surprise at the generosity and community spirit shown by our campus conservative and libertarian groups."  I think Katie is great, and, like I said, this is really a non-issue I'm writing about for lack of anything else to say -- but I don't know that I see her smaller point (I'll get to her larger point in a moment).  I don't see her examples -- The Squash Club volunteering at a soup kitchen, or the Ballroom Dancing Society adopting a family for Thanksgiving -- as substantially different from my example of the Environmental Law Society sponsoring a conference on diversity.  If people wanted to volunteer at a soup kitchen, they wouldn't join the squash club to do it.  Not that there's anything wrong with these organizations doing whatever they want to do -- which is why it's a non-issue.  It's fine that the GOP sponsored a blood drive.  I just thought it was funny.  And (here's the larger point) it's not I think conservatives are anti-community service or generosity.  Heck, if anything, the conservative social solution -- people (and private charities) helping people -- fits that model more than the liberal social solution -- government helping people.  Gross generalizations, I know.  But I say it to show I don't at all think that being a conservative makes someone less inclined to have community spirit.  I just didn't realize that the collection of blood was on the conservative agenda.  It's not a political position -- I think we all support the concept of blood drives, regardless of political affiliation.  Hence it surprised me to see a politically-aligned group sponsoring it.  That's all I meant.  Really.
