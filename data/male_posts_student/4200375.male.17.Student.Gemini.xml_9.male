And get it done before English class Now thought in mind except for one thing If I get a bad grade my parents will kick my ass It'll be hard to do it, I fear Write a poem with no content on a single line The key is to keep your mind clear And focus on making the lines rhyme But my vocavulary isn't all that great But I still think, I'll be able to extend This poem I'm trying to create I'm almost there; I'm towards the end So here it is, if this couplet rhymes I'm done And the battle of the sonnet I will have won.
