As I sit here listening to a CD of some wonderful OSJ (pronounced ahz-jay, stands for old-school jazz; mad props to  urlLink Taylor  for the lend), I'm compelled to be philosophical.  However, I'm lacking the mental strength to do that right now, so I'll settle for random musings.  Ahhh, complacency: the fruit of life.  I'm not hating, but I am strongly disliking our school administration right now.  Long story short, that great JSA Stanford experience I've been raving about since last summer basically counts for nothing at school.  They refuse to recognize it as a program worthy of allowing me to receive credit at school.  But do I let that stop me?  No, sir, Captain PG-17's here and ready for action!  I'm writing a letter to Dr. Albers, getting my Stanford gov't professor to write a letter, and getting together all my schoolwork from back then to prove to them that Stanford is AT LEAST on par with MCC correspondence standards (please, oh please, note the sarcasm).  I hate Pre-Cal.  I wish it would die...well, if it were living.  It's not that I  totally  suck at it, but my work ethic sucks so I'm often up late doing homework and rarely study for quizzes or tests.  I need to get my butt in gear and start trying to bring my grade up.  Band officer tryouts are tomorrow.  I guess I should be more excited than I am, but...I don't know, I just can't get myself pumped up about it.  Drum major auditions are Friday, and, likewise, I'm not too jumping-for-joy about that either.  Man, I need a protein shake.  Just a couple of weeks left, Philly-boy.  Just a couple of weeks.
