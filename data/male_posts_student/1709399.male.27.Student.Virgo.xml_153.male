Kal Ho Naa Ho was a typical Karan Johar movie ( Though he didn't direct it) with foreign locales, kitsch dresses , Good songs  loads of Sentiment. It reminds you of Anand ( Though its nowhere close to the Classic ) . The appreciable aspect of the movie is the underlying humor throughout the movie. The movie inspite of all its weaknesses is worth a one-time watch.                               Dhool was a typical tamil masala movie. Its breezed past very fast with some songs, action by Vikram. it was very tautly directed and having seen very few tamil movies in the last few years , it was a refreshing change for me.
