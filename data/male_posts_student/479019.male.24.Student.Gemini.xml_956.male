Other guest stars were Melissa, Janet and Julia. Then there was a hallway in a castle with a bunch of doors that was like out of a Scooby Doo episode, and a Planet of the Apes musical number in which the apes played music as I sang Van Morrison's "Brown Eyed Girl."  I've been having weird dreams lately.  ***
