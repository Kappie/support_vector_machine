Now, I'm getting into the first half of a whole, and I don't seem at all prepared to fulfill the second half any time near... Is not that I don't have those feelings for this guy, au contraire... But it has passed a long time... LONG, LONG, LONG time since the last time... I even feel as a virgin... LOL, yeah right!  Still... today has a nice feeling... I may get into something I thought I didn't want and was avoiding... we'll see what happens...   Two weeks, well one week. That's what it took for me to fall in love...!!! I'm so easy...!!! Hahahahaha..!!!!     Now, movie topic...   Underworld.  First, let's see what kind of movie person are you. Do you like action or drama? Do you like monsters or dreamy guys and leading ladies? Do you liked or hated the matrix?...  Well, non of the above matters... Underworld is a nice mix of story, monsters, outfits and special effects that do not made the movie, they enhanced it... It is true, the movie gets a little too slow after a great start, but is still bearable... now for the story, is actually good for what it is, don't know why, don't know how, however they managed to scrounge a love plot between Kate and the guy from Felicity... still it doesn't hurt that much to the story, aside that you don't care if he gets killed or they end up together... Now, at the end part or twist or plot of the story you get to see Kate in a great leathery outfit that if I were str8 I'd go for it even though she's SO out of my league. Just check the nice effect when she jumps with a sword from one side of the camera to the other side all in the middle of a pond or whatever its called... just a plain and good popcorn movie to leave problems out the theater... Now, the style is so good. Gothic decadent and rich in blacks, whites and reds... is a cool flick.    urlLink    Sony Pictures at IGN urlLink
