But, anyway, I'm also in a better mood it seems like.  Yesterday was just one of those days where I get really irritated at the smallest things.  And that doesn't happen too often with me.  1 month and 3 days to go until school starts... and it doesn't seem to be coming any faster.  Things are starting to slow down again.  I thought today was going to be Friday when I woke up, but no.  It's only Tuesday.  Thinking about another school year starting is hard to believe...so much is going to be different there this year, and, it's my last year of school.  All of the senior privileges are going to start, and its going to feel weird when it does.    I keep flashing back to my life in Ocala, for some reason.  Every time I think about something, my friends from back there are suddenly in the picture.  I think its about time I finally go back there and see what's been going on.  It's been forever since I've seen any of them.  In fact, its been since October 2001 since I saw any of them.  Hard to believe its been that long, but, I think its about time for a visit.    You may remember a few weeks ago when I said I was going to download that America's Army game.  Well, that download failed, and this Leech Get thing may help me get it.  I'm going to go test it out and review it on my other blog, so be sure to check it out.  Until next time, stay unbored.
