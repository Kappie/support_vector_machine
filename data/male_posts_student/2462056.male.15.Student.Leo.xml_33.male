Haha, but it was somewhat cool because I got to see all these people and stuff.  It was way to early though... they should have had it like, this afternoon.  And damn, it was like, 100 degrees outside, well, actually 98, but still, thats hot as butt.  Tonight there is a choir DDR party, and that will be fun, getting back together with the choir and hanging out.  I'm excited.  I started working on a new song last night, this is what i have so far:   Is it me or is it you? Or is it the shit we both go through We've had our ups and we've had our downs We've had our smiles and our share of frowns And now that we've both gone our separate ways This reminds me so much of those highschool plays The girl and the guy, the problems at hand The struggle between them Snapped like a rubber band    So yeah... haha I wish I took creative writing this year... I'll take it next year though.
