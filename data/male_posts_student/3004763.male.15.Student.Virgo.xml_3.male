I haven't said much about this trip because I didn't want to get my self a lil to hype before I found out what my grades were but now that I know what they are I know that I will talk about it a lot. Also it's 4 weeks after the D.C. trip so I will have a lot of stuff to do till the next trip. So like a week before  I have to get all my homework and do it in Herman and in Jeff City. We are gonna ride there on out there we stark in St. Charles out by the Casino and we go till Herman the first day then the second day we ride till we hit Jeff city. But before all of that I have to pay $80 dollars that is some Bull spit.
