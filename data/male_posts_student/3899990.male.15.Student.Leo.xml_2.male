If you forgot what I am packing for, here's a short description:  I will be attending the FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America) National Leadership Conference which will be held in Denver, Colorado.  It will be held from July 12th to the 18th.  I'll remember to take my camera and take some pictures for all of you to see!  And if the hotel is really good... I can post some entries while I'm there using their "Business Center".  Basically a business center has a copy machine, some computers you can use for internet, etc. for the guests of the hotel.  You guys are still free to call my cell at any time.  But if I am in the middle of the conference, I won't answer it; so just leave a message and I'll get back to you.  I hope all of you have a great week and don't forget about me!
