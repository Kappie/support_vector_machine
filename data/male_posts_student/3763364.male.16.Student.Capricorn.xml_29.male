Oh and full fledged insanity. But not the George W. Bush kind, the Emily Dickinson kind. Sans the suicide. She wrote some of the most beautiful poetry in the history of mankind, she was alone, and crazy as a loon as well. I don't care if she's been dead for hundreds of years! It was a match made in heaven!  On a sidenote, has anybody else gotten sick of all of the pornography/spam type blogs? I, for one, have. This is supposed to be an intereactive online community, not just another cess-pool of human filth. God.  Hahah speaking of filth, I took this quiz that determines which of the presedential cantidates I am most aligned with. WOOO! Kerry all the way! Bush scored a whopping 5% on the test. I'm not American, but I still want that crazy son of a bitch out of office.  Funny Bush vs. Kerry Cartoon:  urlLink http://atomfilms.shockwave.com/contentPlay/shockwave.jsp?id=this_land=1ratingBar=off   Har Har Har.   Many people are telling me that I should be a writer. Hehe. I'm just that telented (Ego ego ego!!!). Maybe I should. I even got a fan-mail a couple of weeks ago! That was nice.  I dunno if I could ever be a professional writer. What if I'm not all that great? Well...Stephen King is a terrible author, and look how sucessful he is! That gives me hop. Spelt incorrectly on purpose, for those of you who have read Lyddie.  Did I mention I entered in an online poetry competition? I got a letter a few weeks after, telling me that I was a semifinalist. The poem that I entered wasn't even that great, now that I think of it. Further investigation revealed that the competition was a scam. Way to shatter that dream.  I've been bloody bored as hell. I'm bored as hell. I've considered getting a part-time job to pass the time, but then there are some problems. One, I have to wake up at a decent hour and/or sleep every night. This could be easily overcome, however. Two, like a job at Wal-Mart or KFC would be all that riveting anyways. Three, I'd be making minimum god damned wage, which is fucking bullcrap. I could make more money in a day panhandling. Three, all of my friends are out of town, and I would like a job with at least ONE of my friends. (Ya can't always get whatcha want, though.) Four, I go to the gym two to three times a week. Balancing work and working out could be rather cumbersome. And tiring. A good time to go to the Talisman Centre to work out is around 1-4, before the droves ofworking class adultsget there. Having a work schedule to follow might make things just a tad difficult. Five, this is supposed to be my summer! I'm supposed to relax, chill out, go to fucking Guatemala. Hey, I said SUPPOSED. I've gotten my fair share of chilling out.  So far summer has sucked shit. I think the last exciting thing I did was mow the fucking lawn. I'm so tired my corneas hurt....AAAAGH.  You know what would be nice? A conversational partner other than myself/Alter ego.  Let me tell you about my alter ego. His full name is Chris Vincent Metzen, him and I look exactly alike. We have many things in common, but what makes him interesting is that he has different stances on certain subjects than I do. Chris hates Bush as much as I do, but we tend to disagree on other things. I will not elaborate on those things. One way that Chris happens to differ is that he is a homocidal maniac. Good thing he does not posess any corporeal form! Heh? Heh? Am I right?  However, the thing about spending most of your time alone with yourself, is you get bored very easily. Chris knows me inside and out, and I know him inside out. There really isn't much to talk about anymore.  The name, Chris Vincent Metzen, is actually that of a Writer/Creative designer for Blizzard corporation. I just liked the name. Nice ring to it. SO i decided to give it to my alter ego. He's just that special.  Does anybody know a good way to raise a hundred thousand dollars in a hurry? Just wondering....   You know, I don't even wath much television anymore. Daytime TV blows and has always blown. And even when "normal" TV comes on, it's crap too. Friends, Frasier and Seinfeld re-runs.  I seriously cannot fucking live in a society that worships Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. All the reality TV was bullshit before. These two retards brought it to a whole new level. Words cannot express.  And the Newleyweds!? Hey, Jessica, call me when you can tell the difference between tuna fish and chicken. Jesus. People are making millions of dollars off ofthat moron.  Society is sick. Just sick.  Big Brother five? FIVE!?  And the simple life! Old porn stars, alcoholics, and televangelists are entertaining the mind-numbed masses.  Survivor, The Bachelor, Bachelorette, Joe Schmoe, The Swan, Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire!?  Our world is proliferated with this shit.  At the very, very least, start making shows with REAL actors (not burnt out ones), with DIRECTORS, and a SCRIPT. I mean, fixing television is not going to save the world. It's not going to solve world hunger, cure aids, or clean the environment. But Jesus Tapdancing Christ, is this what our society has come to!?  I swear if that damned Simple Life comes on for a third season, I'm going to kill those two apathetic sluts. How about spendning that $500k on cleaning up oil spills in the Atlantic, rather than buying Prada boots made from the seals that died in it!  Hm...Lack of human-to-human interaction seems to have soured my intropersonal skills. And I'm developing a nast rage problem, to boot.   Adieu, my diary. This life is just you and I.
