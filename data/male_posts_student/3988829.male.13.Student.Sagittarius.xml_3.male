Arsenal, oh Arsenal - who dares to cross their path? Chelsea, Liverpool, Tottenham... you were all demolished and left struggling in Arsenal's wake (ha!). BUT... even though I support the Gunners and consider them the best team in the whole world,I strongly believe they will not be able to go through next season unbeaten. Yes, I'm serious. All good things come to and end, no? Seeing the rise of Chelsea and Man U's hunger for revenge, it looks like they'll have a bone to pick with Arsenal next season. It is time for Arsenal to stop concentrating on the domesti league and... WIN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE! Yes! They must step out of England (literally and figuratively) and win that bloody Champions League. It makes me sick when I look at pictures of Manchester United after winning the Champions League in 1999... the happy faces of Peter Schmeichel, David Beckham et al. So Arsenal - go out there and show them Europeans what you're made of!
