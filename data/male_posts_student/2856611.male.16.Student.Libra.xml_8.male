GCSE today which I got REALLY frustrated in because I found it so hard to sit there for 2 and a half hours without movign around. I think I did well, I'm not sure, I hope so anyway. Tonight I just watched the last episode of Friends which was quite sad and also this Big Brother 5 thing, which just seems to scream confrontations heres the line-up so far, Marco, a really queen-y, gay, (I think), happy, hyper guy, Ackhmed, a guy who hates gays and seems quite bitter because hes been an ex-asylum seeker, Jay (I think that was it) a guy who is obviously going to show it all off since he turned up in a thong, he thinks hes pretty good looking but claims he doesn't love himself and finally Dan, a gay guy who hates gay's who are queen-y. Loads of confrontational people there. Anyhow, not much planned lately, Im just chilling out. Betty, your alright!
