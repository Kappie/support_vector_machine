So, after church, we drove all the way to  urlLink Easton Lodge Gardens . As we live in Luton, Easton Lodge Gardens (ELG) aren't that far away. But with the heat, and the long winding country roads, it seemed much longer.  Anyway, as our family quite often goes to visit old country homes, stately gardens etc, I wasn't to happy to be going. Luckily, ELG were very different from other gardens I've seen. It was, until quite recently, neglected, and had fallen into ruin - if gardens can do that.  So the gardens are quite wild and rugged, but have an inherent neatness. The day was really, really hot, but still nice. We had a picnic under a massive cedar tree with a long swing coming down. After that we just wandered through the gardens, and eventually settled down by a long glade. Thereupon most of the family lay down, and stayed in that position until it was time to go.  As we approached Luton, it started to rain.
