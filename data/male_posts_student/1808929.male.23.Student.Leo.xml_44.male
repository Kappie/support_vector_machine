In less than two days I’ll start a 4-day preceptorship with Dr. Perry in Sanger, Texas, but I’m about 3 weeks out of my first year of medical school and I’m almost 3 months out of my first clinical medicine class. I know that I’ll learn a lot, but when I think back to my first day working with Dr. Vanderheiden about three months ago I remember it being so rough. That experience and the final pathology course really gave me a kick in the ass and showed me how stupid I really am. I guess I’ve got to stop worrying about what I can’t control and instead focus on doing a good job for the one D.O. that works in my neighborhood. It’s a cool opportunity.
