We talked randomly in Japanese and Spanish at Shelby Farms so that we could draw odd looks from passerbys and confuse each other thoroughly in this odd exchange of ideas. The moon looked huge as it rose while the sun set into the horizon.  Then we observed a show of Eddie Izzard. He, truly, is fucking insane, but he is an "executive transvestite", so do not mock him. He spoke about the empire of Hitler ("Nazi shithead") who ran into Russia like Napolean and received a nasty shock from the weather ("vegan Nazi shithead - would you like some human flesh? Tastes like chicken"). Then Izzard spoke of the ancient Roman gods: Geoff, god of biscuits, and Scott, god of hairdos. ("Cake or death?" "I want cake" "Give him his cake!")  My short story that I am working on currently is currently a load of BS. That is why it is 16 pages long, and it imitates a book I am made to read and study and utterly tear apart for AP English 11, because that is all we do - tear the book apart until it has no literary or intellectual value and is made into some damn life lesson. We murdered Old Man and the Sea (Hemingway) last year; it has no appeal to me anymore. I killed it.  Poetry that I wrote randomly because I wanted to speak of this evening's events:   Two figures walking, conversing The intricacies of three random languages Hispanic Boy comments to Oriental Girl Commenting on the beauty of the sunset reflection Sitting to watch the final sunrays That ignite the clouds, flammable tender And the moon is rising, magnified.  Ocean of darkness plunging forth Torrents that have broken the resplendent dam Swirling 'round, the perfect tornado Spain and Japan hide in a two-story home Fucking ugly, with those malevolent spotlights Contemplate the dishes, from Third World or the East And chose the red rice While laughing at the bloody British.  Strawberry and a chocolate cream Lingering sensation But a memory on a tasteful palate Arguing over poetry and human imagination Arguing over the green paper strips, US religion Capitalist pigs that we are (Damn them all, boil the melting pot) Tori Amos flinging her notes carelessly to open ears.  A simple hug to show mutual respect The night air is growing cooler with the suspended pearl Quite a lovely evening The light kiss upon the left hand But surprisingly for the foolish hermit A kiss by the lips of the falling tear Shocked for a moment, temporary silence The sign returned to the right of the right eye Where she had fallen before.   Cheers, my fellow mortals. Have a lovely evening.
