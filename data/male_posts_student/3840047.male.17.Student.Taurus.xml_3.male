Ineffable words do you no justice like phantasms they are empty, devoid of the light that is you they scrawl across my page, unaware to the futility of their facade for they are not you, nor can they ever hope to be for you are ineffable   The Music of Nat King Cole   Refined A vintage wine splendidly aged Untainted Anxiously I sample this pure spirit Jubilation Euphoria, I feel its golden rapture disseminating throughout my being Crisp Sparkling, tantalizing, a refreshing indulgence Sensuous Intoxicating, alluring, seductive, I whole heartedly succumb to its influence Need I long for more.  Sorrow  Sorrow is as the January wind, abstract in its very essence, Invisible, ethereal, elusive yet existent Deadly, at its worst a chilling viscous entity, depriving us of vitality Its presence is felt by all, undeniable, irresistible At our backs it thrusts, and we in turn run, hoping to elude At our front it scours the exposed extremities, those which we have left unprotected There is no shelter; no haven from its touch for it is natural, essential At times its commanding concentrate is tangible, overpowering, terrible At times it is gentle, crisp, a refreshing reminder of life We learn to live with its cold presence; we steel ourselves,  Encase ourselves in sheets of cotton; we cope with its angry squall,  Continuing with our lives.
