I just did one this cold cold Sunday morning, and 'tis a lovely poem.  One of the best, if I do say so myself.  It was sort of a colaboration, or in reality, Summer thought it up, and I was in her presense and decided to take the go about, and poof, program.  I'm not sure if the last sentence made sense, but bear with me here.    Alas, the programming is calling me........
