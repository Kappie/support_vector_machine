Took math + history exams today, nothing too complicated  After school I came back here and talked on AIM and such for a bit then Jason and Tommy came and picked me up to take me to 'ann arbor' to go to a car parts 'store.'  I guess Ann Arbor is a codeword for Howell and a car parts store is code for a JUNKYARD.  So I spent an hour and a half or so running around a junkyard doing random things.  Fun stuff.  I tore off a rear-view mirror to give to Kyle Raymond at school as a joke since his is broken but then I realized I'm not going back to school for months.  Came back here and just hung out for awhile, until Ryan IMed me asking for a ride to Dan's.  At pretty much the exact same time, Tommy asked if I wanted to do anything with him and Corey so I picked Ryan up and drove him over to Dan's then went to Tommy's.  I accidently burned out at the corner of Whitewood and M-36 lol.  So I went over to Tommy's and we did some more random things.  Corey, him, and I piled into the car and drove to Brighton, went to Bestbuy and drove around for a long time, got some food and such and came home.  Went to Cap'n Frosty's for some ice cream and went back to Tommy's.  After like 10 minutes at his house, they decided they wanted to go to Corey's.  So again we got into the car and went over there, watched some of the Pistons game while Corey and Tommy took turns playing MAtt on Gunbound.  Then we decided to go get Corey's Xbox from Ian, did that, took them back to Corey's, decided I wanted to go home, and here I am.  Sorry, I'm rambling.  Well that's basically my day.  Melissa moves tomorrow I think, sad day.  She wrote on my arm again, it was like a farewell, sad.  At least I can talk to her online sometimes.  But still.  It's just not the same.  Well that's all for now, later
