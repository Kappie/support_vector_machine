And about how I hate homework. With a passion. Cuz I wanted to go to the movies...but...yeah. Not enough time.   Actually I think my Winter Ball picture isn't bad. I look a   bit more mature   than usual. My shirt was cool. Like fire compared to the ice of Joanna's dress...or something stupid like that. And I like my hair parted more than spiked...but whatever. Ouch. I was looking for a frame for it, and I cut my left thumb on the glass. Cuts get more painful after a while...endorphins wearing off...surprised I remembered something from biology didn't you. Didn't you! Yuh-huh...Anyhoo I found a frame and washed it, but...I...kinda...put the picture in first. So, some of the glossy stuff washed off. Grr. If only they invented water-resistant glossy picture stuff...  the world would be a better place ...   Super Bowl...  go Raiders  ...that would be cool. Do you guys really want a party at my house tomorrow? Cuz I got new sofas in my living room, which are nice. I could burn a CD to play on the stereo...  50 Cent, In Da Club  . AHH!! So good. But I have a fucking 27 inch TV.   Damn small.   At least I have that lovely bird fountain in my backyard. And a GameCube. With TimeSplitters 2. And a Lord of the Rings calendar in my room. And   posters .  Which makes my house/room the   best ever .   If you're interested in the party...could we get   another chatroom up tonight   about it? Thanks.
