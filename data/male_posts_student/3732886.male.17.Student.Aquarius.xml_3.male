I don't have to much to write today, for my life sucks, not in "I want to kill myself" way but as in "i'm so fucking bored" kinda way. I woke up around 11 o'clock where I started reading some Dracula, great book about, you guessed it Dracula(I'm in the part where Mina has been biten, and van helsing and the gang start going to bless all the boxes). It's getting preety damn intense, but anyways, our house is for sale, so a couple of people came by to check it out, didn't even notice how nicely I had cleaned my room 5 minutes before they got here, and then left. After lunch i sat down and started practicing tarot cards. I'm still only learning the Major Arcana's but I'm getting to know the cards much better. Afterwards, I watched the first harry potter and found out that the reason Snape was so freaking familiar in the movie was because he was Hans in Die Hard, I knew i recognized him but i couldn't figure it out. After I released that load of my back I came to the computer where i typed all the shit i had done in the day. Which brings me to now! I have nothing else to say since I have nothing else to do for the day, so until next time...Au Revoir.
