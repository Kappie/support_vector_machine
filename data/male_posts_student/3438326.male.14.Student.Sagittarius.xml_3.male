Amy  Crazy, and slightly on the lesbian side *cough* maya *cough*, one of my best friends even though I despised her in year 7 and a bit of year 8. But she's the most amazing and amasing person in the world. Woo yay (see I left it in cos Amy typed that!). Her blog is  urlLink here     Claire  My crazy lil' bunnygirl. And the sel-proclaimed 'grace' to my 'will'. Mmmm Will!   Jess Loade  A wonderful, purple-haired individual, who never ceases to amaze me with her amasing 'with an s' sense of Humour. Woo!   Josh  My really fit (straight) friend who goes to everyman youth theatre, with shoulder length long blonde hair, which was removed in a tragic accident!   Kathryn  A really nice person who I mentioned before. I got off with her, and everyone thinks shes really pretty. I love her to bits. 4 words, if your reading; woo, yay, mm hmm and shallow! Her blog is  urlLink here    Maya  Hmm, which one of Mayas personalities should I describe? Most of the time, shes a great person who is very pretty, but when she is winding up Patrick she's not as nice. She's great at acting! Her blog is  urlLink here  (I think)   Patrick  What should I say about Patrick? Well, he is... um... Patrick. I suppose you have to know him... His blog is  urlLink here  I won't give you the password   Rach from Drama  My best friend in my group at drama, apart from MAYBE Josh. She has had a hard time, but I suppose we all have. She is really cool, makes her own clothes most of the time (nice skirt) and is v flirty. I love her.   Rachel  This is the Rach at school. She is clever, witty, a great actress and public speaker, and constant make-fun-of-Patrick-er. She's ama's'ing. I've known her for *counts on fingers* 5 YEARS!   Sureyya  I haven't known her as long, but she's just as good a friend. She is cool, funny, a buffy/angel/yas fan, and HAS AN I-POD! I WANT ONE! Lame. Oh well! She also seems to have a very scary violent side, so stay on the good side of her!   The drama people.  I felt that all the people who did smike deserve a mention so here they are:- Jenny Hector Laura Emily Chanel Abi Jess(who hannah knows) Helen Ru Chris Tim (With the boadacious bod) George (With the not AS boadacious bod) Alex James Alice Aileen Michelle Harrie Kat and Rach (but theyve been mentioned) Umm... (Kat pls say who I've missed)   Trina  Also known her for 5 years, Trina is a great friend because she is always neutral, so if me and rachel fight (as we almost constantly do) shes there on both (or neither) sides. Can I hera a Woo Yay for trina?   Yasmin  And last but definately not least, my wonderful, sensitive, witty little ex-girlfriend. I think she's the most wonderful friend a guy could ever have because she will always be there, when everyone else is gone, I know that she'll still be ther. *hugs* Her blog is  urlLink here   So those are my friends. What do we think?
