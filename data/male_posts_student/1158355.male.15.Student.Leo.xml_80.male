Also, the priest... I mean I said mozzletoff, he said WRONG! Back at my cousin's house, the priest came to visit there to so we couldn't cuss or wear our yamakas. Then my cousin pissed across the street. Uh, today lots of fun at Kaiser's. First Matt and I rode bikes around to Chris Michaelis' house where Matt cried because he was lost. Then he got more lost so cried so more. When I say cry, I mean whining and fussing, not literally crying. Don't worry Matt if you cried I wouldn't tell the whole 3 people who actually read this. Ok, so Matt tried to get me lost but it didn't work because I'm MISTER NAVIGATION. then we went to the mansion AND THEN!!! we split into two different ways eeeh haii. Yes, I biked all the way to Huntington and Matt went back to his neighborhood. It was awesome, I crossed Sunken Meadow Parkway and everything. I was so confused. I had to ask an ice cream man to find my way back. It was so silly yet so fun. Then some lady flew in front of me and I flipped over the handle bars while laughing because the dog barked in a funny way. I got up thinking I was fine, I started biking away and realized there was a cut below my knee almost down to the bone. I choose not to get stitches because their a big bitch. Instead I sped back to Matt's, he treated me like a little baby, put the Sesame Street bandade on me with the cream stuff, fed me my yogurt and tucked me into bed. Then the big boys came over, and I'm talking one year older than us... that's right, the 10th graders. Pat, Dan, Ahmad, Chris and many others were there. We played Ultimate Frisbee for a very long time, my team won both times. We also played manhunt, then walked around the block where I found a bag of bread where Bryan threw it all over me. I got over excited and celebrated with moldy bread all over me. Now I'm sleeping at Patrick Olsen's where I will have molto fun. Good Bye?
