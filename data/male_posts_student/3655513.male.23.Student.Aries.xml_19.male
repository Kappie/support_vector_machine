I've always enjoyed working with my hands, and although it it simply disassembling and reassembling furniture and the such, I find such diversions envigorating from time to time. On the other hand, I would find this diversion much more envigorating if I wasn't sick today.  That's right, it seems I have woken up this morning in the midst of a phenominal head cold. Knew it was coming to some degree, but that doesn't excuse the inconvenience, nor pardon it's intrusion into my life. I have beeen so sick this last year since moving to calgary. In the 5 years prior to moving to calgary, I may have been sick a grand total of 3 times. In this last year though, easily 6 or 7 times now I've been incapacitated from my everyday activities by either head or chest colds, or stomach viruses or something of the sort. Honestly I don't get why, but I must conclude that it has something to do with the environment which I reside in. Either the apartments I live in make me sick, or it's the city itself. The air is much dryer out here than anything I've been used to before (I was born in the lower mainland of B.C. and grew up in humid and wet south-eastern Ontario) and I think it's possible that this contributes to my condition.  Still, it's infuriating to have a city so beautiful make you so miserable.  If this keeps up, I'm going to have to take off time from work. I can barely see, and my nose is threatening to drip onto my shirt.  Dirty praries, and dumb mountains. Bah.  Rooster
