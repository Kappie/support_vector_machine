It droned on and on. Howard Dean was great. I loved his parts of the speech that went back to what he was saying during the primaries. He said that everyone there spoke for the "Democratic wing of the Democratic Party." He did his little "You have the power!" thing, which I think is a sort of magic spell that he casts.    The big speech of the night was Illinois Senate Candidate Barak Obama. He spoke of a united America, not a divided one. It was just amazing. He is going to be the next US Senator from Illinois because there is no Republican running from there anymore after Jack Ryan dropped out because of a sex scandal. He is a rising star in the Democratic Party and may be the first Black President.   I'll be back later today after John Edwards' acceptance speech.  PS: I read that  urlLink http://http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/27/politics/main632296.shtml  Nader is planning to crash the party in Boston by trying to get in as a journalist. He should only show up there if he is going to announce that he is dropping out and supporting John Kerry. If he goes in there the delegates will try to kill him. I wonder if Al Gore is still there.
