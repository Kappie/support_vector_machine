This summer I will be working at an Italian restaurant called Bellavia.  I will have good hours that will enable me to stay up late and wake up late.  Hopefully by the end of the summer I will have made enough money to go to Gen Con and have some left over for Anime Reactor.  Gen Con is a great convention.  Lots of gaming goes on,and they have some of the best anime rooms.  Last year I went and had a mighty good time.  Sleep now takes place.
