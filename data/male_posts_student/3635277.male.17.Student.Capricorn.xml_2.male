I had the first two lessons only, giving me four hours of being a bum in the common room (actually, i only had 1 1/2 lessons, the second one was called off halfway due to rain) Anyways, it seems pauls had enough of my "flirting" with the other girls, mainly Kelly and Sarah and to a certain extent, Rach. What can i say Paul? Except that ive become everything i ever hated back at www.twinking.crimsonblog.com (see one of the old posts) and i have to say, I enjoy it! You may look dumb and such, but hey, who doesnt like abit of attention every now and then (especially from the opposite sex?!)  With that out of the way, there aint much to say really. 'cept that were still on for camping, even with the others trying to scare us into not going, and i think i have found the perfect place! its secluded, trees all around, and away from roads. i think its private property but it dosent look like many people have been there.....  ever...... I shall name these new fields "The Veggie fields"  Oh, and TKMaxx still made me work with my buggered arm, but its getting better! Ta for all the sympathy (even though it was my fault!)  uhh,.... i'll update some other time (prehaps from my nan's on sunday) about the Veggie fields trip.  Keep it safe Veg  -_-Gossip-_- aparantly everyones saying Joe's got a drinking problem... i say drink up dude, its my round! Enjoy it while u can!!   -_-/Gossip-_-
