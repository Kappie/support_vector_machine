It comes bearing down and there's nothing I can do about it except accept my fate with good humour and just a touch of chagrin.  Yes, it's that time of my life my friends. My 25th birthday. A quarter of a century old. Half of 50. Holy crap. I look back and think "Where the hell did this come from??". This certainly isn't due for a couple of years yet, surely? But then reality gives me a quick kick to the head and says "Nup, you're here man. Better make the best of it!".  So what have I learnt in the 25 years I have been on this planet? Hmmm... tough question.   Well, I suppose one thing is, to quote Good Charlotte: "Some friends become enemies, some friends become family...".   It's easier to hate than it is to forgive.  Falling in love is easier than falling out of love.  Money (most certainly) makes the world go 'round.  80s music rocks (sometimes).  Change is inevitable and anyone who doesn't adapt to change dies (both metaphorically and literally speaking).  Sometimes you HAVE to lie and sometimes you HAVE to face up to the music.  Moving for a woman sometimes works out (in mysterious ways).  Life is never as you left it 5 minutes ago.  Women are a fickle breed who will NEVER be understood by the males of the species.  Tooheys Old is a great drink. Caprioscas (a vodka drink) are even better.  It's the unknown that makes life interesting.  Everyone needs someone to say "Thanks".  Love, whether it be platonic or 'true love', is one of the best things in the world.  On the same note, love can hurt like a muthafucker.  Blood may be thicker than water, but I'll always want a friend's fist in a fight than a family members' harshly spoken words.  If it can go wrong doesn't mean it will go wrong but there's nothing wrong with preparing for the worst.  True friends are becoming few and far between.  Hang on to the people you care about.  And, finally, just be thankful you're still around.   So that's my soapbox confessional done for the next 25 years. I'll see you all back here on the eve of my 50th.   Lowman X.
