Well, not really, because Shackies are generally good natured. *mumbles something about Future Shop employees*.   Last night was Justins b-day. I sure am glad I suggested going to BP's, it was a lot funner that sitting around his house watching anime. Blargh. Almost everyone showed up, except for John. John never shows up. Oh well, nothing to be done about that, I suppose. I have been neglecting my photo blog. I have been neglecting my camera. I should go take some pictures sometime.   I'm scheduled to work 11-10 today. I don't really have a problem with that, should make for a profitable day, but tomorrow, I work at 8 in the morning, until 6 at night. I am not doing this. I will go to work at 9:15 tomorrow to open the store. Then, I will leave when I get tired. So take that.  My arm is horribly bruised. I will take a picture of it tonight. My friends bite hard.  I don't really want to go to work today. Wait. Let me rephrase that. I really don't want to go to work today.   There's blood on my living room floor, reminders of girls that I've loved before --Boys Night Out
