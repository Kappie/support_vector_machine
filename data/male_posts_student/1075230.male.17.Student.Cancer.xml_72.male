My bday is actually today... most people comment on how I can drive now... but for me, more importantly is the fact that I can take NLS (lifeguarding course) now ^^;;    Ahh... basically, everyone split up and did their own thing yesterday... ^^;; something tells me that's not exactly very party-ish, ehheh... so... i need you people to tell me what I could've done better. Here are some things I thought of already:     The host could've paid more attention to the guests        The party could've been more interesting        There should've been more planning    I'm sure there is much more to that list... but can't think of any right now.   Present-wise... welll, the best present I guess... is just having everyone there ^^;; Thanx to everyone for being there (and of course your pressies ^-~)!   Ahh... itz aite with me if you stay late... but my parents are probably less enthusiastic about it... ^^;; I guess that's bout it...   ~Chronos
