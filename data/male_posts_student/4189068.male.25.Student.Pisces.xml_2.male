I just googled the word "blog" and found this site and set it up and now I suppose I need to write something that will pique your jaded, speed-addled mind.  There is a vision immediately: I write for three hours every day and not a soul reads what I'm saying. Does it go anywhere? Is  Tom Ridge  the only one listening?  Well, Tom, I'm going to write to _you_. You are my audience for this first blog post of mine, and perhaps many after.  There is nothing to fear with yours truly! I am a peace loving soul who is presently listening to music so hip  Rick Santorum  doesn't even play it. And he's so young and with it, isn't he?  Sure he is, Tom! You know the story, my friend.  That's right Tom: Send your jackbooted thugs elsewhere! The terror alert level on this blog is permanently green.  But, Mr. Ashcroft, that's green as in "safe, upstanding, and fully clothed," not "pot-smoking demon spawn."  I have never read another person's blog, so I don't quite know what I should discuss. I'm leaning towards a delightful potpourri of political observations, vague attempts at humor, and pure slander, as is my wont.  Of course, if I don't read other blogs, how can I expect any of you to read what I'm saying? I suppose the point is this: what you are saying isn't very interesting. If it was, I'd be reading it. Ergo, if there's nothing worth reading in the vast world of blogging, there's obviously a void waiting to be filled by none other than me, Buford X.  But, seriously: there is a lot to discuss. There is a presidential election approaching. There is a war. There is music and "culture" going on somewhere. People are doing strange things in weird places. There are my friends and their many peccadilloes. And there are, of course, my own experiences here rockin' in the free world.  Christ, this feels so impersonal. But let's try a little observation, eh?   for fuck's sake, what the hell is fucking going on? how do we allow the wool to be pulled over our eyes with such willingness?      i read and article titled  The Tyranny of Petty Coercion  by Marilynne Robinson of Harper's Magazine today and i see what I've been waiting to see: somebody finally discussing how the term "bush bashing" has weaseled it's way into our lexicon as a token response to anyone speaking ill of the president...      ... thus causing anyone who buys into the term "bush bashing" to immediately peg the speaker of something labeled as such as merely another anti-american pinko who hates freedom.      maybe i want to say, "The president made a mistake in going to Iraq before he had a plan for maintaining the peace." i would say that is a VALID OBSERVATION, however, the think-tanks and talking-point artists in the right wing have introduced and popularized this simple retort, "bush bashing," so my VALID OBSERVATION is immediately labeled as the ramblings of a non-patriot who is probably rooting around in a bowl of granola and angel dust.    god damn it all anyway.     In personal news, my friend  April Strickland  will soon be in town (by the way, I reside in Medford, OR. Don't tell anyone). She is definitely the hippest, sweetest, hottest woman in the East Village. And on Thursday, a visit from  John Kerry . I visited the Democratic Party HQ today to obtain my tickets to the event. They looked at me like I had the plague, and I can't for the life of me figure out why.  I plan on doing a short rundown of the present state of affairs to end my email.  Time:  12:08AM Pacific  Music:  Stephen Malkmus  Weather:  78 and clear  Wearing:  white t-shirt and white boxers     Okay, perhaps I will refrain from including the last one.  This took too long. This will surely be my final blog.  Mr Ridge, I hope you enjoyed this.  Mahalo.  Buford X
