Yes, this week saw the start of the second semester, and my few weeks of leisure have come to  an end. When my alarm clock went off on Monday morning, I  wondered who had snuck into my room and changed the setting! Talk about shocks to the system. What with early rising, confronting the traffic, and finding a parking space, all before I even step into a classroom! But it is good to be back, catching up with friends again, and diving head-first into a whole new batch of subjects. Also I will be out in a classroom for four weeks later in the semester, and I'm really looking forward to that.   If I Could Turn Back Time   Sometimes I think we all do things we later wish we hadn't. Situations we could have handled better, things we should, or shouldn't have said. I once read a column by someone, who wondered what life would be like if Windows shortcut keys worked in real life, if we could 'CTRL Z' whenever we stuffed up. Sometimes I would love to be able to do that, just take back mistakes and try again. At other times I realize that mistakes are part of life, that sometimes we are going to make choices and take actions that are not the smartest. The only sure way to avoid making mistakes, to avoid doing something stupid, to avoid getting hurt, is to do nothing. If we shut ourselves up in a little box, where no one can see us, and we can see no one, then we can keep ourselves safe from hurt, and prevent ourselves from hurting others. But that isn't how life is meant to be lived. Life isn't about hiding, it isn't about always playing it safe. Sometimes you have to take that chance, try for that goal. Once I said about myself that 'there was a time I would go out on a limb, just to see how far I could go before it broke'. That person, the one who took chances, and got hurt a lot, seems very far away now, but sometimes I still catch a glimpse of him, and he encourages me to take the chance.  What is behind the above musing? As always, with me, there is something that prompts what I write. This time it is a situation I have created, by saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. It has led to a tense situation, and I'm now trying to work through it, hoping that time, and my leaving things alone, will fix the mess I created, when I took a chance.
