That's only four of the five food groups, you need to balance it out with some vegetables or you'll die...a man's body can only take so many heart attacks. Now, eat some vegetables, try some onion rings."  Yeah, I'm a fat fucker. Summer has a special knack for making me fatter, and it doesn't help that I'm stuck inside all day. When you only use one finger to click or change channels, nothing is "exercised."  It's like summer cabin fever; well, not so much fever, more like cabin fatter.  Ok, I need to work out and prolly eat a little better. My body could use more onion rings and the like.  So, I will once again start my journey. Hopefully this time it ends a few pounds lighter, not just bulkier. And fitness is not the only reason to be looking good.  I'll just leave that up to you to ponder over.  No Cameron, I'm still not telling you...
