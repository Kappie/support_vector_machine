I am very much hoping that people do not follow the practice of people in Hillbrow South Africa and   urlLink throw things  at my party. Oh well. Well see what happens. I have the feeling the turnout will be not too shabby, and so i should have a good time indeed. Got the perfect boots to wears with my dress from J. She is always giving stuff away to people. Very nice of her to do so. everyone should go, it'll be a fabulous time. Just took this quiz and guess who ended up as the gay one. Yes, that is right, moi.  Congratulations!
