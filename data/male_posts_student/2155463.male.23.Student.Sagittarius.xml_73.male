I thought I'd post them in case they helped anyone else and so I could reference them myself later...  "The times when I feel most estranged from God can bring on a sense of desperation, which presents a new starting point for grace."  "God can forgive any sin and can deal with any spiritual condition.  We fall down, we get up, a pattern the Bible amply illustrated, as with David and Peter.  God does require honesty, thought.  We dare not misrepresent ourselves to God, for by doing so, we close our hands to grace."  "As long as we do not become inured to the pain around us and in us, and indifferent to the world's fallenness, as long as we do not feel too at home here, we allow space for God to enter."  "My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going.  I do not see the road ahead of me.  I cannot know for certain where it will end.  Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so.  But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you." - Thomas Merton  "Somehow, somewhere, I I know that He loves me, even though I do not feel that love as I can feel a human embrace, even though I do not hear a voice as I hear human words of consolation, even though I do not see a smile, as I can see in a human face.  Still God speaks to me, looks at me, and embraces me there, where I am still unable to notice." - Henri Nouwen  "The burning of a little straw may hide the stars, but the stars outlast the smoke." - Voltaire
