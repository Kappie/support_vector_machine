Gefilte fish, incidentally, is an appetizer made of lots of fish, ground up and formed into fish balls, covered in what I can only assume is fish-flavored jelly, eaten with little tiny carrots and bright red radioactive horseradish.  Gefilte fish actually looks kind of like matzoh balls, except bigger and fishier.  One year my grandmother couldn't get her matzoh balls to be the right consistency ("These matzoh balls are too firm;" "These matzoh balls are too soft;" "These matzoh balls are just right") and made about a hundred of them and froze the "defects."  I joked with her that she should have given them out to the trick-or-treaters on Halloween.  Heck, it's better than pennies.

I don't know why I've decided that could be fun.  UPDATE: Here's the best of the haiku I received.  From Madeline, who has a lovely weblog  urlLink here : I pray for freedom From matzoh constipation Next year buy whole wheat  From Michelle, who as far as I know doesn't have a weblog: Where is Elijah? He must be wasted by now. Let's give him grape juice.  [If anyone's looking for Equal Time, feel free to send me an Easter haiku.]  UPDATE 2:  urlLink Beanie  sends this Easter one:  I need a pink Peep. Chocolate just will not do. Not yellow or blue.
