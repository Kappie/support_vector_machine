Let's start with MyAlbum:  MyAlbum:  If you’re looking for a tool to help you create a digital photo album, then, you might want to keep looking, because today’s download of the day is not very good.  It’s called MyAlbum, and even though it sounds like a good idea, it’s not, because this program isn’t very good.  At all.    Even though it’s got a small download size, clocking in at only 2.1 megabytes, it still is definitely not worth it.  There are some perks to this program, but, chances are, if you were to keep looking for an even better album creation tool, you’d find them in practically any one.  For one thing, you can create a slide show from the pictures you upload, and then put them to background music and add all sorts of effects.  Not just that, but, there are a ton of customization options for your album.  That’s all that is good about this.     urlLink    MyAlbum may look easy from the start, but... urlLink     On the negative side of this program, the customization options can and probably will confuse the hell out of some people, depending on how well you know computers.  The interface, also, is very ugly, and there are several different album creation programs that are more graphically pleasing than this one.  And, when you actually look at your slideshow, everything is too blurry and pixelated, and it looks better on even PowerPoint, from Windows.    Bottom line?  There are much better products than MyAlbum, but, some people with low memory space on their computer may find it interesting.  That’s why I’m going to give MyAlbum a disappointing, upsetting  2 out of 5.    urlLink    ...You'll start getting confused around here. urlLink    -------------------------------- Mozilla Firefox  Now, you saw me review Mozilla Firefox for the tip of the day on Thursday, but, now, you're getting the whole, full blown review.  And it deserves one, too, because this is one of the most powerful and fastest browsers in the world.  Mozilla uses the Netscape technology, and makes it faster.  It doesn't have the slow down that the Netscape Browser does, and it's very open ended.  You can customize practically everything, from the theme of the browser to the popups that can and can't be blocked.  It's not hard to change stuff, which makes the customization a lot better than MyAlbum, which I reviewed above.     urlLink    Mozilla Firefox looks nice, it's fast, and it is very open ended for those who have to change stuff, like the theme, for example. And its easy to use. urlLink     The cool thing about Mozilla Firefox, even though we're seeing it in most browsers these days, is the tabbing features.  You can set tabs to automatically open when you start Firefox (see today's tip later today), and all you have to do to switch tabs is just click.  Like the rest of Firefox, its completely easy to use.  The new version, 0.9, gives the tabs a brand new look, and they couldn't look any better.  Now, when you start using Firefox for a while, don't go back to IE, because you will see just how much slower it really is.  Firefox uses the Netscape technology, like I mentioned above, which allows for faster loading times.  If its text that you've gone to the site for, it will load the text, then start worrying about all the graphics and pictures and stuff.  It couldn't be any faster.  Overall, I'd say Firefox is definitely worth a good score. I only gave it a 4 or so when I reviewed it for the Tip of the Day last week, but, now, with the new version that I just downloaded, that score automatically jumps to a  5 out of 5.   Join me tomorrow for tomorrow's Download of the Day, which is Mozilla Thunderbird, Mozilla's answer to Microsoft Outlook.
