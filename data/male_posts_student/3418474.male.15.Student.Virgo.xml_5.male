Wow I'm tired:S not just physically, but mentally and spirituallly. School has been a drain on my mind...cuz I had to finish alot of hw.  I'm sick of all the on going battles inside me:S.  Man Jesus called us to be either hot or cold and right now I'm just sitting in one place.  My pastor said there's no such thing as staying in one spot because it's an uphill battle, soo if ur doin nothing ur only goin downhill.  I'm soo spiritually hungry right now...I need to have my tank filled.  Man I want Jesus soo badly right now.  I'm soo lost with the friends situation:S I have no clue what goin on.  I want Jesus like crazy, but it makes it hard when the friends who were all going for God kinda ditch u and then u haveta become friends with all these people who rn't too into the things of God.  I've worried about friends alot this past semester of school.  It's taken alot of my mind off of other things.  Now I'm just putting it into God's hands and waiting.  There's nothing I can do.  W/e I try to make happen I botch it up.  I need the Lord to help me in all things:).  I'm sooo glad it's summer now...finally I can take a moment to breathe:P and just think about what's goin on.  I wanna get my life totally in sink with what God wants.  It's gonna be tough to do.  I just need God to provide me with some awesome friends again like I had b4....:PIn these stupids blogs I've talked bout how I want to live for God and stuff and all and I meant it, but I haven't changed much since and i want a dramatic change to happen.  Something soo dramatic that people will recognize I'm a christian by only looking in my eyes.  I want Jesus written all over me. :S I'm tired of lukewarm living. I'm tired of ups and downs and I'm tired of worrying about my future when God has control.  I need to live christ.  Man:s the battle is insane.  Be praying for me :) I need as much of it as I can get.  I want to learn my life purpose and what God has planned for me and what direction I'm supposed to head.  I'll pray for anyone who sends me a prayer request:D just email it to me.  Whoever did the Bible study or worship thing with me...Do u guys wanna do that again sometime??? that was cool.  Like...Mark, Joel, Steph, SOnja, Nicole, umm Lorne haha whoever reads this and who's up for it we should do something.  Anyways God Bless You All and COmments are great:) haha especially when u don't put it anonymous(y) Anonymous ones suck:P  Haha gosh this is long cya later
