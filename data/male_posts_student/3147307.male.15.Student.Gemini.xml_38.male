     
      I just played 18 holes of golf. I did OK. Shot an 81. My 1st shot went 10 feet - that's cause I haven't played for a couple of months. On hole 4, I hit a 25 foot putt for bogey. Then on hole 5, I nailed the green (167 yd hole) and parred (3) the hole. Another par (3) on hole 6. On hole 15, I hit a beauty. 115 yds, across a creek, and 10 feet to the hole. My birdie putt rimmed out and I tapped it in for 3. I beat Joel by 16 strokes.
