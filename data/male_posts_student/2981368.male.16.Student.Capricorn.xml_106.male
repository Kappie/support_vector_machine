Woohoo!  ----------  BERLIN (Reuters) - Losing his license did not stop a drunk German driver from jumping back into his car a day later to buy more of his favorite tipple -- only to be nabbed a second time by police who this time seized the car as well.        Following a tip-off, police had stopped the 51-year-old on Monday, when a breath test showed a blood alcohol level  more than 10 times over the legal limit.     "The officers could not remember ever having recorded such a high level," said a police spokesman in Hagen, western Germany. The man's license was taken away.    The next morning, the man again bought sparkling wine and drove home. Police again stopped him and recorded an even higher alcohol level -- almost  double the amount considered life-threatening to most people.     "This time, the officers confiscated his car too," the spokesman said. The man will be charged.  ----------  Talk about a stuuuupid last sentence. "The man will be charged." Of course hes gonna be charged! Not like they're gonna send him gifts of thanks or anything...jeeeez.
