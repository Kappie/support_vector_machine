If you don't use blogger you won't know what I mean but I get what Zoe meant by WYSIWYG now. *shudders*  Anyway, what's been going on? Work experience went well on the whole, I think next time I go into DSP they'll be all "Hey, Jon, how's it going?" and I'll be all "I really shouldn't be here!". But I digress. Return ... Planet was also good, although I'm not 100% on whether I'll be getting the cheque for that. Arse. Had a concert today with GYWO, went well, and got on well with Aynsley (apparently that's how you spell her nameO_o)and have made a new friend in Emily. Woo. More lovely ladies for the tour. Well, at the moment mostly Meg, Aynsley, and Emily, but you know...  Speaking of lovelyladies, went to see the Cheltenham-Birmingham match on Saturday with Laura andGem, and it was pretty cool. We drew with a premiership side, which is not bad. I missed our goal because mum happened to phone me just before. Bloody typical. But yeah, was cool to watch, cause I could actually see what was going on, and was with more than just myself, rather than like last time. Might go more often if that would be my company. Said goodbye to Laura for the next couple of weeks, cause I'm off, and felt really sad about that. Will miss everyone but you know...  Oh yeah, while it occurs, cause I've got the Belgium tour and then the Orchestra course, don't really expect bloggage before the 1st of August. It'll be a really long post then, I promise. Tell you all about it (and whether I pulled (joking...ish)).  Quote of the day: "Come home, my darling,  Iknow thatyou know that I want you here, Come home, my darling, come home, I want you here."
