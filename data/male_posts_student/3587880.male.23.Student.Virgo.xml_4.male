I was sort of stressed about my passport and whether it would come in time for me to leave the country, but when I got home from work today I found it was waiting for me, or so I thought. I opened up the package to find that they'd mailed it back to me unprocessed because the pictures I had given weren't right. My image on the photos was too small and there were shadows behind my ears which apparently isn't allowed. So with less than two weeks left I have to go get new pictures taken and request a rush job on the processing of my passport application. It's do-able but it's still one more stress that I'd prefer not to have experienced.  It doesn't seem like it's all only two weeks away. A week from Saturday (aka Aug. 21) at 6:00 I fly out of Regina for Minneapolis. I guess  "in a post Sept. 11th era"  I need to be at the airport three hours early for international flights, so I'll be there at the boring old Regina airport at 3:00 in the morning. I didn't know it was even open that early. Oh well!  So even though it's fast approaching I'm not really taking it seriously. I mean I've sold my car in order to take care of my student loans for the year, and I've put together the list of potential supporters that they've asked me for, but other than that it doesn't really feel like it's going to happen. Then one day I'll wake up on the floor of an American church and I'll be there and it'll be underway. It still doesn't feel real yet.
