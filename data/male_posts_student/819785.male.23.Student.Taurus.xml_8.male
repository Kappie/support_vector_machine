After all my problems with it before, it seems that it still doesn't like my little Linux box. Complains time and time again. Segmentation fault, it says - I say, what the hell is one of those? Apparently it can sometimes happen if your system memory or hard drive is developing a failure, but every other piece of evidence I have seems to indicate they're both fine. Guess the only way to find out is if it burns a hole in my carpet.  So the box is, for now at least, back to running Fedora. It does the job, it's not as customised as Gentoo would have been, but as long as it works, I don't really care. Some of the parts of the site I was working on while on my breaks at uni yesterday have been uploaded, and they seem to work fine as well. As a bonus, it looks ok under Windows as well. Just wish the default Windows fonts were as nice as the Linux ones. Suppose I could fix the fonts, I know there's a way to do that, but on the whole I think keeping it simple is the best idea.  Anyway, sometime over the next few days I'll be implementing the features for proper logins (at the moment it's hardcoded while I test it, so I've got to swap that back out to MySQL again - couldn't code that at uni, they just don't have the facility - or if they do, they're not telling the students :P), and then news posts. Any comments on the site, be they technical, artistic or otherwise, should be redirected to webmaster@alltheusualsuspects.co.uk. Best you tell me any problems now, while it's still relatively simple to fix them, than later on when I have to wade through 4 miles of PHP code to work out what's gone wrong!  Anyway, bye for now people!
