Tough Times Don't Last, But Tough Minds Do- Louis OBS Instructor...those so-called gangsters...they are mostly jus being immatured...i believe that they are sent by god as an obstacle to test our faith...and further on later in their lives, they will b cleanse...that's what i truly think... Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers; and blessed is he who trusts in the LORD- Proverbs 16 Verse 20...then some may go on and ask... what is love? it is simply...A word...like mentioned in the matrix...it's a word that serves no meaning. the true meaning of it lies in each indivdual's heart...true it is that there is no necessary to love...but all humans need love to go on, to give themselves a little push when they need it....i shan't elaborate but i hope i find my true one soon...-OySt3r
