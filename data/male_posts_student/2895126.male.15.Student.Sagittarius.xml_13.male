I'm posting this from Biology, wherein we are doing a "WebQuest." I'll talk about gym later, because I just realized I have about two minutes until the end of the period... Something interesting  did  happen.   EDIT:   Well, in gym, after performing a nice "tae bo" (description courtesy Bob Tunney) serve in volleyball and succeeding four times in getting it nice on the other side, the sophomores, who exclusively composed the other team, decided that this break in the natural order of things must be stopped and me, the transgressor, must be punished, especially because I am me and I am not supposed to do well in gym. So they spiked it and my short reign came to an end. Tragic.
