While a student with a BSBA in Accounting might prefer to take the grad accounting course online, another student, who is not as charmed by numbers as the first one, might prefer to take it in class. Generally, the classroom environment is apprehended as more helpful and supportive, as it provides a closer link to the instructor face-to-face. Therefore, an in-class course might be preferable if the subject is perceived as very difficult and complicated. Lastly, it is a good advice to always, if possible, take concentration courses in-class. In my own experience, they are usually a little less theoretical, as they often offer more personal and practical points of view.   Self-discipline  Some online courses have weekly chat room discussions, while others are a little more flexible in their structure. Still, there are fixed deadlines and due dates, which demand continuous efforts throughout the semester. Since an online course, due to its impersonal form, is easily apprehended as less impending than its in-class version, it is very simple to postpone work to a rainy day. Therefore, an online course requires students to not let their self-discipline subside. If there is group work involved, it is particularly important to not wait until the last minute, as this might cause trouble for will-powered team members.   Access  Access to a computer with an Internet connection is probably the most critical success factor. Without Internet access, success will be truly hard to accomplish. While the computer lab might be sufficient for ordinary school work, it is by a hair’s breadth sufficient for an online class. Potential online students should bear in mind; an online class does not mean less work, in fact, more often than not does such a class signify the opposite. On the other hand, a broadband connection is not of vital importance. Though it makes it a whole lot easier, a dial-up connection is certainly sufficient for online success.   Computer literacy  Just as certain courses have specific prerequisites to simplify matters, basic computer literacy is to recommend to anyone considering taking an online class. Knowing your way around the Internet and using fundamental software like Microsoft Office is of vital importance. The risk, otherwise, is that the student spends more time solving irrelevant and unrelated problems rather than participating and resolving course related assignments. However, considering that the student in question is assumingly already accepted into grad school, we can only hope that he or she posses a fundamental understanding of computers and their accessories.   Motivation  Without motivation it is hard to succeed in any endeavor embarked on. An online class is no exception. Enthusiasm and a genuine interest to do well are the driving forces of success. Since it is harder for an online instructor to empower his or her students – after all, an in-class a professor’s true zest for the subject is more easily transferable – the online student benefits the most if they behold a craving desire already before the course starts. Furthermore, by carefully reading the syllabus and other information provided, an online student can better plan the semester, and thereby avoid future bottlenecks. By continuously keeping up with the current schedule, the student increases his or her chances to thrive.
