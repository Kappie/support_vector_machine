Like, when we went to this Group Dynamix crap, everybody there was born and raised in a little UU bubble that made them cringe at anything different. Sound familiar?  We were playing Mario Kart 64(Oldschool, huh?) at the group dynamix thing and me and my friend AJ, who were born and raised in a very free-form, bubble-free environment(in the REAL FUCKING WORLD), were playing and throwing the usual gaming insults at one another (you suck, haha i pwned your ass, etc.), and teh other two uu kids who were playing just got all insulted and went "we don't have to play video games with violence, could you just please quit calling eachother stupid?"  We were kinda at a loss of what to do so I decided to go back in the "gym" room and participating in the beating of eachother with giant heavy sticks. Well, one thing led to another and Nicholas ended up beating me in the face really hard with it, almost knocking me cold. After getting up, I had this horrible headache that wouldn't go away, and it stayed for another 2 days. I got sick and threw up on the way home after that lockin.  So, the point of the story is, Bubble uu's made me sick.   Ehehehee  chad_wina: OOOO chad_wina: cleaning is oh so fun ShuChoMouff: ahahah ShuChoMouff: you're kidding, right? ShuChoMouff: Just kidding. ShuChoMouff: See, i'm kidding. ShuChoMouff: but you're not kidding. ShuChoMouff: the tables have turned! chad_wina: hahahahahahhaah   ShuChoMouff: :-O has you seen Donnie Darko? RabidBabyBunny: nope ShuChoMouff: dear god it was good ShuChoMouff: you should have come to the movie night RabidBabyBunny: i was babysitting RabidBabyBunny: and grounded ShuChoMouff: Phour what? RabidBabyBunny: school stuff ShuChoMouff: did you bomb the counselors again? RabidBabyBunny: yeah.. ShuChoMouff: I told you..   So we went to movie night, and we watched 3 movies(and slept through the last one i'm going to list), History of the world part I, Bowling for Columbine, Donnie Darko, and Life of Brian.  History of the world was funny yet cliched, bowling for columbine was great, Life of Brian i had seen, but man... Donnie Darko... wow.  The movie is so beyond words in the meaning it conveys, that it's hard for me to explain it to people to where it makes sense.  Sure, I could tell you the plot. The plot is about a kid named Donnie Darko that is seeing a psychiatrist for what his parents are hoping isn't schitzophrenia. He also had sleep walking problems, and one night he wondered out of his house, down to the golf course, and saw a giant intimidating looking man in a rabbit suit that told him when the world is going to end. The next morning after being awoken by golfers, he returns home to find that a jet engine had crashed through his room, and would have killed him if he hadn't been sleepwalking.  But it's so much more than that.  After the crash, the rabbit(named frank) tells him to do things, that are violent in nature, but usually have a positive outcome.  For instance, there was a person named Jim Cunningham who had come up with this "great" psychological treatment for kids that basically lumped all of human emotions into two sections- fear and love. This is obviously flawed, but i'm not going to go into it.  Anyway, the rabbit makes him set Cunningham's house on fire, and while searching the wreckage, fire crews found a Kiddie porn dungeon. He was arrested. Genius.  Some of the conversations they have through the movie are so powerful that they stick in your mind. It probably has one of the largest collection of good quotes i've ever seen.  --------------------------------------  Donnie: First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did. She was sent in as Gargamel's evil spy with the intention of destroying the Smurf village, but the overwhelming goodness of the Smurf way of life transformed her. And as for the whole gang-bang scenario, it just couldn't happen. Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have reproductive organs under those little white pants. That's what's so illogical, you know, about being a Smurf. What's the point of living if you don't have a dick?  Donnie: How can you do that?  Frank(the rabbit): I can do anything I want. And so can you.  [At the school assembly speaking out against Jim Cunningham]  Donnie: Do you want your sister to lose weight? Tell her to get off the couch, stop eating twinkies and maybe go out for field hockey. You know what? No one ever knows what they want to be when they grow up. You know it takes a little, little while to find that out, right, Jim? And you... yeah, you. Sick of some jerk shoving your head down the toilet? Well, you know what? Maybe... you should lift some weights, or uh, take a karate lesson and the next time he's tries to do it, you kick him in the balls.  Frank: Twenty-eight days... six hours... forty-two minutes... twelve seconds. That... is when the world... will end.  Gretchen: You're weird.  Donnie: Sorry.  Gretchen: No, that was a compliment.  Gretchen: Donnie Darko? What the hell kind of name is that? It's like some sort of superhero or something  Donnie: What makes you think I'm not?  Donnie: Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?  Frank: Why do you wear that stupid man suit?  Donnie: [in a letter] Dear Roberta Sparrow, I have reached the end of your book and... there are so many things that I need to ask you. Sometimes I'm afraid of what you might tell me. Sometimes I'm afraid that you'll tell me that this is not a work of fiction. I can only hope that the answers will come to me in my sleep. I hope that when the world comes to an end, I can breathe a sigh of relief, because there will be so much to look forward to.  Kitty Farmer: I'll tell you what he said. He asked me to forcibly insert the Life Line exercise card into my anus.  Donnie: [to his mother] How's it feel to have a wacko for a son?  Rose Darko: It feels wonderful.  Roberta Sparrow: Every creature on this earth dies alone  Gretchen: ...what if you could go back in time, and take all those hours of pain and darkness and replace them with something better?  Donnie: You are such a fuckass.  Elizabeth: Did you just call me a fuckass? You can go suck a fuck.  Donnie: Oh, please, tell me Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?  Donnie: Frank, when's this gonna stop?  Frank: You should already know that.  Dr. Lilian Thurman: The search for God is absurd?  Donnie: It is if everyone dies alone.  Jim Cunningham: Son... DO YOU SEE THIS? This is an Anger Prisoner. A textbook example. DO YOU SEE THE FEAR, PEOPLE? This boy is scared to death of the truth. Son, it breaks my heart to say this, but I believe you are a very troubled and confused young man. I believe you are searching for the answers in all the wrong places...  Donnie: You're right, actually. I am pretty- I'm, I'm pretty troubled and I'm, I'm pretty confused. But I. . .and I'm afraid. Really, really afraid. Really afraid. But I... I... I think you're the fucking Antichrist.  [Watching George Bush Snr. give a speech on TV]  Edward Darko(donnie's dad): Tell 'em, George.  Samantha Darko: What's a fuckass?  Rose Darko: Do you even know who Graham Greene is?  Kitty Farmer: I think we've all seen Bonanza.  Prof. Kenneth Monnitoff: I am not going to be able to continue this conversation  Donnie: Why?  Prof. Kenneth Monnitoff: I could lose my job.  Prof. Kenneth Monnitoff: And did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That maybe darkness is part of their natural development.  [Donnie tries to kiss Gretchen and she pulls away]  Donnie: Well I-I, sorry I...  Gretchen: Donnie wait...  Donnie: I like you a lot...  Gretchen: I just want it to be... at a time when... it...  Donnie: When what?  Gretchen: When it reminds me just...  Donnie: When it reminds you of how beautiful the world can be?  Gretchen: Yeah...  [turns her head]  Gretchen: and right now there's some fat guy over there staring at us.  Kitty Farmer: Okay, now girls... I want you to concentrate. Failure is not an option. And Bethany, if you feel the need to vomit up there... just swallow it.  [Donnie is under hypnosis by his therapist] Donnie: My parents didn't get me what I wanted for Christmas.  Dr. Lilian Thurman: What did you want?  Donnie: Hungry Hungry Hippos.  Dr. Lilian Thurman: And how did you feel, being denied these hungry, hungry hippos?  Donnie: Regret. Dr. Lilian Thurman: What else makes you feel regret, Donnie?  Donnie: [suddenly breaking into a wide grin] That I did it again...  Karen Pomeroy: A famous linguist once said that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations, 'Cellar Door' was the most beautiful.  ------------------------------------------  Some things in the movie were never made clear, and left open to speculation. It works for me. The reason The first Matrix was so popular was because it only showed you about 2% of the universe the Wachowski brothers had created, and left the rest up to you to decide how you wanted Zion to look, or how many people actually lived outside the computer.  Then the second and third movies came out, and it tried to do so much that it wasn't meant to do. That's the reason. People don't want as much imagination as you need for books, but they do want some in movies.  I was surfing the web, and i found a donnie darko forum on imdb.com(just by coincidence, i swear), and this guy named 9 reasons he liked the movie. It was okay, until this guy named Whoelse comes in and busts up the party and said "You were born in 1987? You're too young to understand this!" and wouldn't get it into his head that noone cared what he said, and it pissed me off so much that i actually signed up for the boards, just to post this:  "Whoelse is pissing me off enough to actually make me sign up to this board to say this...   "There's one on every board."   Congratulations, you stupid assrape! Everybody on the internet hates you!   You're just a sick little person that gets on the internet trying to make people feel bad, just so you can get a little pleasure because you actually have a speck of power behind your keyboard in your safe house.   Oh, and yes, Donnie Darko is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It gave me something to ponder over, which is good, because I haven't had a good "thinking" topic since my discovery of Blue Man Group.   Well, chances are you won't ever see me post here again. Ciao."
