I got my notes on Chomsky done, and I just need to do a review on the customs and law reading and take a peak at the Collins book before I'm done for the night.   Oh... in other news... I emailed some people I haven't talked to in ages. I got one response for far, which was cool. Hopefully my mail box will be full tomorrow with lots of neat emails.  In rotation right now... some  NOFX .  ***
