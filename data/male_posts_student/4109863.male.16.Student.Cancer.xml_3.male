Everyone is learning, growing in maturity or understanding, whether for good or evil. So can an age be placed on knowledge? A thirty year old man may seem grown to a fourteen year old boy, but to a fifty year old man, the thirty year old merely seems like a young man. A person can not or will not stay the same. People constantly change. They grow, some up and some down, some out and some in, but their all growing. Though I'm not a grown man, no one truely is "grown up" untill he is with his Savior. Then he knows true knowledge. So do not let my youth discourage you. I am merely growing on another terrace or running on another path than those of different ages.
