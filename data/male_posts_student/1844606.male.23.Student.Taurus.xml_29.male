Why would you want to write creatively when you could make six figures writing for fitness magazines?  Capitalism and consumerism had babies at some point and its offspring set up shop tonight at the Union.    Basically this post is about my realization of selling myself to the highest bidder and hoping that I can enjoy my job at some point.  Oh yes I almost forgot.   Somebody from the Illini basketball team got a job at the DI.  I'm sure they took him based soley on his writing abilities...
