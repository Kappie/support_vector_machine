But today is Sunday, and I should damn well be fellowshipping! My times at church, catechism, mission trip meeting, and youth group were all spent in silence. A rare interjecting, a uncommon spoken word. But almost nothing. It is beginning to become unsettling even to me. I know I'm a loner, but my church time should be spent learning, asking question about God and to him. Strange and sad.  During youth group, one of my...acquaintances began talking about staring at the beautiful chicks in such and such a place. I told him I was trying to avoid that kind of thing and his jaw dropped. I could almost imagine the thoughts floating through his head. Loser. Homosexual. Self-righteous prick. Hell, I'd described myself as these sometimes. The reason I tend to escape any sexual interaction, even weak and useless stuff like ogling that occasional set of knockers, is a twisted and painful tale. Let's just say I've had a hard time with an Internet pornagraphy addiction, and ogling should be the last damnable action on my to-do list. Its ironic. He talked about watching out for thongs. That's how my addiction began. With looking at thong pics. *sigh* Life's depressing sometimes. Suck it up and pray.
