But I did practice all of my scales. Because here's the motto:   The scale is  EVERYTHING . If I can play scales, then I can play anything in any key. Because the scale is everything.   So I did at least practice them. So here's a practice tip. If you have like just 5 minutes to practice, then don't just skip practicing. You can use that 5 minutes to at least practice your scales.  Even though I don't have a clue to who these guys are, they have  really good quotes.   "Do you ask me how good a player you may become? The tell me how much you practice the scales."  -Carl Czerny   "Scales should never be dry. If you are not interested in them, work with them until you do become interested in them."  -Artur Rubinstein  So I guess that's all the advice I can give you today! :) That's on the house by the way, but I will start charging extra!  :) I KID, I KID!  Go Practice!
