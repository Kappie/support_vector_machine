Who in the right frame of mind would want to know the probability that the computer can be repaired in 24 hours? Or how about this... Find the probability that an athlete would completed a random lap with mean 65 seconds.... How lame can the questions get? The questions made no sense at all.... Sigh. Maths is such a useless thing... Don't even how why I'm spending my precious time on this...    Oh no... I totally forgot that there is Singapore Brainest Kid on TV today. Sigh. Wanted to watch it because the way those kids answer the question is very cute and funny. Sigh. Must wait for one more week before I can see the show again. Sigh. This is what happens when your brains get too much a dose of maths tutorial questions on some stupid distribution...    I'm just glad that at least something went well. Argentina and Brazil are just ninety minutes away from facing each other, not counting extra time and penalties... And they are going to meet in the final... Haha... Hopefully nothing screws up and these two teams can meet each other. Haha. Should be exciting. Two powerhouses of South America, if not the world, are meeting each other!!! Hooray... Though both teams are not playing at their strongest, Brazil playing their third choice team and Argentina playing their second choice team, this match is surely a match not to be missed. Haha. Look forward to this match...    Sigh. I'm so tired. The end is about to end. Then it will be Wednesday... A short day but very packed... Then there is econs lecture...Sigh. I hate econs lecture. Times seems to slow down whenever there is econs... Guess I will fall asleep during lecture again...    Haha...Since we are at it, let me pose a maths question:    What is the probability that KwokSiong will fall asleep in econs lecture on Wednesday given that he spends his Tuesday night typing this blog? Give your answer to the nearest whole number.    Answer: 1  Zzzzzzzzz.....
