I don't know what they were thinking, I don't really want to know either.  Yay! I got a "Site o' the day" for you guys. It's called Super Arcade. There are a lot of cool games there. Well, actually, for all I know more than half of them could be crappy. The ones I played were pretty cool. You can even play slime volleyball. Anyways, it's an overall good site.   In other news...well...there is no other news. Talk to you later.
