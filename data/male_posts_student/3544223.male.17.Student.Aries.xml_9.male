I don't know also, what went through my mind was that i should look forward for the oral. My classmates will be taking their oral exam tomorrow 9/8/2004. I will be very free tomorrow to go out. haiz.. time passes so fast but certain things even with each passing time, i can't seem to forget that whole event. I don't know if i had known her for the wrong reason or should i say, i was totally wrong to know her right from the start. In life, everybody has to go through good and bad times. But my life is always going bad, no matter how hard i try it will go bad.    Anyway, nobody will know how i feel, even to care or understand my feelings. haiz.. haiz... i will go bonkers soon. Exam is so near but days passes so slowly.
