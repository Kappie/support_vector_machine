Humans, by nature, take good things for granted. You never really, truly realize how sweet the air you breathe is until you're being held underwater.   I feel like when i was born i had a blindfold put on me before i ever had the chance to open my eyes, and therefore I grew up not even knowing what sight was. And then the blindfold was taken off, and I was granted time to use my eyes, and explore this strange new thing that I loved SOOOO much. And what did I do? Nothing. I took it for granted, and put off until tomorrow what I should do today. It wasn't until i found out that i was going to have to wear the blindfold again that i grasped what a gift i had been given, and how i had pissed it away, and now here i sit, wearing my blindfold, trying to remember fuzzy images that used to be clear.   Anyway, yea, don't take things for granted, make the most of everything you can while it's still good.
