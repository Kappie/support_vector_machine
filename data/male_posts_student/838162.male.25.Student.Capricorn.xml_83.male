Worse one I had in more than a year, even worse than that time I was rushing that Visual C++ programming project. The problem lies with some details about my degree course final year that I would be starting next year. It’s all my fault really, and I’m not pleased with myself for making such a big mistake. I already don’t think very highly of myself, no need to actually go out there and make it come true! In any case, I’m hoping very hard that this issue can be resolved soon.  On top of that, I have to go and  lose  my waist pouch with both my handphone and Sony Clie in it. Made a police report and everything, but I guess whoever found it, was not nice enough to return them. Can’t say I blame him, it takes the best of us of turn down a free handphone and PDA. But nevertheless, it is the right thing to do. Guess not everyone can place himself or herself in the position of the other person who has lost it. In any case, to whoever it was who “ found ” my stuff, if you’re somehow reading this: enjoy your windfall, cause you’ll get what’s coming to you, someday. Oh and I hope you found a way to charge the Clie, the sucker drinks batt power fast.  Thankfully, my parental unit (i.e. Mom) still has her old Motorola V60 lying around, so I’m using that for the time being. Unfortunately it’s going to take some time to get used to the different interface. Some of the Motorola interface is quite troublesome, or perhaps I’m just too spoilt on Nokia.  So with the need for a new phone pushed down the priority list, the next in line would be the PDA. So digging into my savings, I sprang for the new  urlLink Tungsten E  from  urlLink palmOne . It’s the most value for money handheld that they have and after using it for a few days, I’m very pleased with it. Just wished I had gotten it under better circumstances. Now with my savings drained, looks like I’ll have to wait longer for that  urlLink Creative Nomad . Or anything else for that matter. Hope my old player can hold out that long.   So a gentle reminder to myself is in order, always check your stuff, don’t be careless and don’t take what you have for granted.
