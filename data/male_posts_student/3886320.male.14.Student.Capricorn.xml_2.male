So we walked to the video shops, avoiding the jitanos (or Chavs, Muggers, Gangstas or whatever) and got a video while disgusing girls and getting hyped up on pepsi, we went back found the games were crap so we went to swim. We got freaked out by makin up this story that a girl died down in the deep end by the pool (i put the story in a different blog), then after that at night we were bored out of our midns so we decided to take stupid pictures of ourselves, being cool and looking stupid at the same time...heres some pics.    i modified that one on my computer making my hair look absolutely stupid. Thats it.
