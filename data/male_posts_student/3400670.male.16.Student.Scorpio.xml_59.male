There is a "contributing members" section on the sidebar that allows us to look at our APUSH friend's blogging profiles. And I've added three things:  1: tagboard(which is for visitors to post; or you can post short comments and quick questions and answers on some small particular topics - there is a limit to how many words one can post on the tagboard at once), 2: The title bar: The title bar serves to better organize our blogs by forcing everyone of us to post the topic we will be discussing in our posts. Thus people will know exactly what the post is for w/o reading sometimes long and tedious posts. 3: Comment option for every post. Hey, if you feel somebody's got a very interesting, or hilarious, or horrible post, feel free to write some comments about that peculiar post.   THANKS ALL MY FRIENDS!  Thomas
