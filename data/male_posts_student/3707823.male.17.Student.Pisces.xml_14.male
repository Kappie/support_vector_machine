I found a cool webpage that has a lot of stuff about them and all different kinds of ciphers, much more complicated than I can decipher.   urlLink http://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/contents.html   That is the site and it is the best I've found so far on the subject.  One thing I thought was amazing is the Latin Square. It looks like this.  R O T A S O P E R A T E N E T A R E P O S A T O R  Once you look at it you notice that no matter how you look at it, the words can be read exactly the same except by reading diagonal. Maybe I'm just easily amused but that is cool.  'rotas opera tenet arepo sator' roughly translates into 'he who guides the plough sows the seed'.  Everything about the Latin Square can be read  urlLink here .  Here is a little bit of enciphered text that I did, it's an alphabet shift.  TBBQ WBO SVTHEVAT GUVF BHG. V QVQAG NPGHNYL GUVAX NALBAR ERNQ ZL OYBT. ZNLOR LBH PNA YRNIR ZR BAR GB QRPVCURE.  Maybe later I will post some harder blocks on enciphered text.
