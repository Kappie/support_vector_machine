The orc gave a deafening roar and fell to the ground like a huge tree shaking the ground. The thin elf stepped aside nimbly, avoiding the collapsing bulk. Drawing his dagger, he bent down and delivered the killing blow.  The champion looked up from the dead body and saw that his comrades weren’t doing so well. Many of them had fallen before the orcish onslaught. He knew any moment from now would mean life and death. He raced with elegant steps across the slaughter ground avoiding the corpses on the ground.   “To me!” Mansuetus commanded as he raises his sword high so everyone could see. Within minutes the elves formed a circle around him raising their spears high threatening anyone who comes within a metre length. He surveyed his disciplined soldiers proudly. The well-trained elves did not fail him. A few orcs made a daring attempt trying to carve its way through but only ended but with spears through his torso. “ Hold! Elves and you would live. Expect no quarters, for you would give them none!” The leader bellowed and every elf shouted in a single tone.” Hundred of orcs surrounded them waiting for a hole the defenses. A few orcs again made daring attempts but soon ended up dead. It seems the orcs weren’t as patient, Mansuetus thought as a smirk appeared on his face. “ On my command, you would send this brutes to wherever they came from!” He shouted a command in the ancient language to the crossbowmen. The crossbowmen loaded their crossbow and nodded in understanding.  Finally the orcs patient was at an end, the green skins roared and shouted war cries in their primitive language. “Now!” the champion signaled and spears was leveled to the eye and sound of crossbows unleashing death. This was what he savored every moment as the orcs lumbered into the wall of spikes. Steel met steel, blood splattered everywhere and sound of screams and shouts filled the air. “ Fight on my elves and fight well for this day you will replenish the blood within your armors!” Mansuetus charged in fray of combat, slashing and hacking as he went. An orc twice the shoulder length of him and was the largest orc he had ever seen. The massive orc bawled a challenge, and was quickly answered.   Through the visor he stare into the eye of his foe trying to anticipate his every move. The orc wield his axe menacingly and gave an evil laughter. “Fle’ be fo  ma, da wil‘ na de fet ma.” His voice boomed loudly as he made his unstoppable assault. Mansuetus parried with every ounce of strength and speed he could muster. Strands of hair flew as he avoided the humongous axe only by an inche. He saw an opening and made a riposte attack only to see his blade bouncing harmlessly off the orc tough hide. What would appear a grin appeared on the orc ugly face. Beads of perspiration dripped down his delicate face. He was panting heavily and he felt he could not hold off the assault anymore. His bones ache like a rusty mechanism. His green skin foe seems to be tireless only to be laughing and fighting. Fear gripped him like a vice.  Darkness descended. His eyes were wide opened, he groaned in pain. Blood streamed down from his open wound. Every strands of strength was sapped away from him, he could no longer feel his legs, and his limbs were drained. He dropped his axe and crashed into the ground. Mansuetus took moments to realize that a shadowy figure was at the standing at the back of the orc general. He wanted to laugh at the moment but could not. From the shadows came a calmed voice, “Thou have done well Mansuetus, champion of fifth regiment of the Shadow Warriors.” Only to realized he was the assassin, whom his general had spoken well of Mansuetues made a courtly bow and said, “ I thank thee for thine compliment for if thou wouldst have saved me, and I wouldst have fallen to these cursed orcs.”  “The battle is over, assemble the elves and have them report back to the camp immediately,” he spoke softly.  Mansuetus nodded and said, “Yes, my lord.”        Mansuetus walked into his simple house, he took off his armour and took his scabbard and hang it by the side. “Mansuetus! You are finally home I was so worried about you.” Mliara said excitedly as tears swelled in her eyes. She was a beautiful woman, with striking features and fine figure. She ran over to embrace him, and kissed him deeply. Fatigue of the battle and heat of love conflict, and he spoke softly, “I missed you greatly, but I am tired now I wish to rest.” He gave a reassuring smile and wiped the tears softly away from her face. “I have prepared your clothing and when you have finish bathing, we can have a good feast tonight.” He took up his fresh clothing and walked over to the river.   He could see the clear water flowing gushing down the endless river. The wind blew softly and the leaves rustled. He stripped off his bloodstained tunic and entered the refreshing water. He rested on the rocks by the riverbank and enjoys the peaceful and soothing ambience. Life was too perfect for a moment he had a caring and lovely wife and recently he was promoted to captain of his regiment. The extra income would provide a better life for his wife and he himself. He opened his eyes lazily not knowing for how long he had slept. Suddenly sound of splashing water made him jumped to his feet. He quickly put on the robes his wife had sewn for him and with drew the dagger in his boots. He sneaked among the bushes, his natural talents made him moving like a cat, among the bushes. He crouched down and to his horror he saw bands of men dressed in barbaric helms and leather clothing wading through the river.   He quickly made his way back to his house and put on his battle equipment. He and his wife quickly made their way out of the house. Every second lost would mean life and death. They ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Suddenly shouts could be heard. Mansuetus heart raced, as he knew the enemy had spotted them. Mliara tripped on a piece of rock and fell, blood was spotted on her knees. “Mliara!” shouted the battle-trained warrior.   “I can..not…..go on any fur..ther, Mansuetus you must…carry on!” she slurred as tears burst forth from her.   “My love I cannot go on without you, if we must die we must die together.” He ran back and carries her on the back. “You cannot run fast enough if you would carry me, they would soon catch up with us.” Perspiration streamed down his face, muscles tensed as he ran with all his might. Sound of his pursuers came closer and closer; he knew with every step they make they would be one more step towards the city. The chaos men were coming closer and closer. He fought on against the endless tide. What would have seemed forever, he thought ended with a loud thud sound. Droplets of blood glittering in the sun spurted forth. Grief and sorrow overwhelmed him. He stopped and slowly put her down by the side of a tree. An arrow protruded through her chest. “I’m sorry my loved one,” she said drawing all the energy within her. Her eyes closed and he knew she was dead. He gripped his sword and there was a glint of madness in his eyes. Blood course through his veins. He invoked the name of Khaine and turned around to face the chaos worshippers. A muscular man held a bow in his hand and smiled, happy that he had shot the target but soon his smile was gone as he head rolled off to the ground.   Mansuetus, captain of fifth regiment of the Shadow Warriors fought with frenzy and hatred. He was cutting left and right beheading anyone who come within the tip of his blade. The chaos worshippers soon learn to fear him, they surrounded him and no one dared to attempt an attack. He glared menacingly at his foes, if it was as if just a look of his eyes to even cause fear in the heart of a stout dwarf. He swings his blade in a sinister way. Light danced off from his blood-forged armour, the runes on his sleeves glowed brightly. Instead of waiting he lunged forward skewering the groin and hamstringing another. More chaos men formed up around him. Only rage and sorrow were gushing through him. In his eyes he knew no fear. Regardless of his own life he charged into the tide. Hacking and slashing and hewed a path though the chaos men. But slowly he was overwhelmed no matter how fast he could dodge or strike he was unable to. The chaos men swarmed down on him and held him tightly. He roared in rage and bit his teeth into his tongue the sweet taste of blood filled his mouth. Veins were bulging up as he struggled frantically.   A group of elves charged into the fray and it was all too much for the chaos worshippers. They turned and fled ignoring leaving their weapons on the ground. Mansuetus lay on the ground filled with cuts and bruises. A huge scar was evidently marked on his armour only missing his flesh only by a few inche. His eyes were vacant; he felt life has no meaning with the death of his wife. “We spotted this band after a few peasants had sounded the alarm. We apologies for the late arrival.” The leader’s words contained sympathy and fear. He ordered two of his men to aid him to stand. Their faced betrayed irritation as they tried to push it back. Mansuetus staggered across to his wife and knelt beside her. Tears swelled in his eyes, as he buried his head in his wife hair. “ Please wake up my love, I beg of you.”
