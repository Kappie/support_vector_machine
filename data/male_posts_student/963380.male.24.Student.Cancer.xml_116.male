I haven't been able to sustain enough invective to fill even the most meagre of rants.  Could it be I'm actually happy on a grand and global scale? :) Why yes, but no more so than usual. I guess I just have less to complain about.  That strikes me as a good thing. I'm going to start to record my night time observations of a different sort in a seperate blog. If you're a fan of this blog I'll be sure to post the link so you can read some reflections of a slightly more intellectual me.
