Me and Marty headed out to a Knights of Colombus to go see my cousin's band's first show.  They are called  urlLink Designed by You .  Up first was a band called Based On A True Story, and then Flatline, and then Silence of Wake.  They were all really good.  I think it was Flatline that copied off of the Suicide Machines, i dunno, but one of them did, they split the crowd into two and then when he counted to 4 we rushed at eachother braveheart style.  I was up front.  It was a blast.  My cousin's band was up then.  They were sweet.  Nice stuff to skank and then mosh too.  Then there were two bands after them that werent that good.  Then there was Alucard.  They are so good, I got one of their CDs.  In their mosh pit I got a fat lip.  It was so sweet.  The bad part of the show was that there were these gay kids jumping off eachother into the moshpit.  One of them hit Marty right in the face with an elbow.  I saw that and scooped Marty right up and got him off to the side.  He was shaken but OK, he's like an ox, he moshes like crazy haha...but we were pissed at those kids cause they would hit you from behind running full blast when nobody was moshing.  We wanted to hit the guy that was jumping off his friends in midair so he would fall flat on his face, but they didnt do it anymore.  My fat lip is gone, but there is a sweet scab there. heh...just relaxing this weekend now I guess. peace  "With looks so good but flaws so bad." -Alucard
