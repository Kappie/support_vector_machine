So About that party. Well the first hour or so nobody danced except for me doing these funny chicken dances and other stupid stuff (totally unserious, just trying to get the crowd going) eventually people started dancing. I was having fun break-dancing and joking around with people. I was talking to pretty much everyone, except Kendyl. I went up to talk to her (twice) and the first time she ran outside and the second time she turned around and started dancing/talking with some girls that I don't know that well. Then for like the last 30 min she spent the whole time talking to Derek Lahey (or however you spell it) and I'm not positive, but I think she gave him her number and all that stuff. I don't wanna go around talking bad about her, but I can't help but wonder if she does this very often. I mean meet a guy at a party and lead them on and then go on and find someone new? I hope I'm not just one of those flavor of the week and I hope that she doesn't do that. Well I did notice that I danced more, actually towards the end I had about 5 girls aroundme dancing. Does anyone know why... because I'm a P.I.M.P. Hah j/k. So anyway. Today I'm gonna go to the mall and cash in my coins and just go out for lunch and basically take a long walk and think/reflect on yesterdays going-ons. That's it for now, I'll check back in later. Catch you cats on the flip flop later.
