Played awhile of gunbound, getting out of skill -_-''      Played bball at night again, today got ws, xx, zx, kh, jd, wp and me. Today played full court again, together with the red shirt guy from yesterday and two of his friends. Team 1: Red shirt guy from yesterday, kh, xx, wp and jd, Team 2: Two friends of the red shirt guy, zx, ws and me. Team 1 won the match by a big gap. My bball skill getting lousier and lousier, haiz... so sianz...      Wah seh, had to repost all the photos one by one. So troublesome, had to upload to another server and then send to blogger, then had to edit the html and post and change all the photo's link... I think wasted about half an hour.         Transport taken today: None     Feeling: Depressed
