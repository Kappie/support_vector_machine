The campaigns are ignoring most states and are just focusing on the fickle states that can't seem to make up their minds over who they want to vote for. They ignore their base states and I think that it leaves many voters in those states feeling left out of the process because the focus isn't on them. I live in CT and today we were supposed to have a Kerry- Edwards campaign stop today. Instead, the bus caravan went right through the state to Pennsylvania. The big story was that some spotted the bus on its way through. I have also discovered that the campaigns are not willing to spend any money at all in states like mine. I was at a fair today and worked at the democratic booth. We had no material from the Kerry campaign and that is what a lot of people were looking for today. I think that the candidates should campaign in all 50 states and not just appeal to the 5 stupid people in Ohio who can't make up their minds. Who are these people? I do not understand how you can be undecided in this election. These people probably aren't going to vote in the end and they should just be written off because they pay no attention to this election at all and time and money shouldn't be wasted on them at the expense of others who would like to participate more in the process.  My other problem is with the early primary states full of people who don't know who to vote for. These people mainly live in Iowa and New Hampshire. These people practically have the candidates making their breakfast and taking out their garbage every day but they still can't make up their mind. They get the privilege of deciding who the nominee for each party is going to be and they are very indecisive. I hate these people sometimes. How is it that party members in every other state seems to be able to make up their minds yet these stupid farmers in New Hampshire and Iowa can't. Why do we keep indulging these people?
