(Driver's Licence renewall) mother fuckers... hmm.. what else.. oh yeah.. my group project is due tomorrow at 6 so i have to go in and hand in a paper with all of our signatures on it... even though we hand it in electronicly.. for what reason... i do not know. Afterwards.. i guess i'm gonna do some birthday stuff.. I don't even feel like it. So fuckin drained.   So right now (12:50 am June 3rd) i am spending my time working with my group to finish this bullshit off. At least one of them knows what's going on. Ugh... this ... sucks.  But fuck it. Shit happens right? Happy B-day to me.  FnR  PS: The odds of me getting any B-day action is about 30,000,000:1.
