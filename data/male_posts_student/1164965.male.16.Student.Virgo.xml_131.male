I am reading Their Eyes were Watching God, it is a really good book and I highly reccomend it, because it's a story that tells of a woman who had tough relationships, and you may know people like this girl, and eventually meets this awesome guy named Tea Cake, I mean with a name like that why wouldn't you want to read the book.  -Corey Furin-
