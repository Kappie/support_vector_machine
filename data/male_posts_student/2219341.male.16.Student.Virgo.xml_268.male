    
       High above the mountains, far across the sea  I can hear your voice, calling out to me  Brighter then the sun, and darker then the night I can see your love, shining like a light  And on, and on,  this hurt spins like a caroussel If I could travel ‘cross the world, the secrets, I would tell....  You and I... were meant to fly Higher then the clouds, we'll sail across the sky So come with me and you will feel That we’re soaring, that we’re floating off so high ‘Cause you and I were meant to fly  Sailing like a bird high,  on the wings of love Take me higher then, all the stars above  I’m burning, yurning, gently turning, round and round I'm always rising up, I never want, to come back down....  You and I... were meant to fly Higher then the clouds, we'll sail across the sky So come with me, and you will feel That we’re soaring, that we’re floating off so high ‘Cause you and I were meant to fly....
