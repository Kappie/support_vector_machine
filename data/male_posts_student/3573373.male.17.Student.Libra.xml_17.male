(weather gods be warned, we've had lame weather so far and its almost mid-july).  .........  dc is such a mad ghetto outside of the capitol part of it. ive read that the average life expectancy for a black male there is 26 years old. so... not going over into that part of town. sticking with the congressmen and the tourists on that one.   .........  anyway, so i am out of commission for a week. how will people survive with out me around?! haha. pretty easily i'd think.  i get to come back on saturday, hopefully (if the plane isnt delayed) in time for the... uh, velvet teen and/or polar bears show that night.  ...changes in latitutudes, changes in attitudes... ...wastin' away again in margharittaville...  use a coathanger, -nick
