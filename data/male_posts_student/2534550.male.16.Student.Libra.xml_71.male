And in BDB last sunday i was able to hold my horn and thats a big feet for me anyway. Its just really cool because im going to get a gym membership soon and with tour and the gym and my workout tapes i will know longer be called a short scrony black kid. Instead ill be a short black kid hehe but yea enough of this...and that not to bad because in hawaii i wont be embarrased to take my shirt off. lol Well I havent sent the letter, but im about to emailed him(my dad) and im going to tell him that i need some spending money for Hawaii which im getting really excited about. and i think that whatever he can send me will help so yea. I think im going to throw my grades in thier 2 because im really really proud of them 2.  P Mult Med Desn A+ ROP Rorensic Sc B+ P Am Lit            B P US History      B P Chamber Choir A+ Teacher Assist    A Community Serv A GPA: 3.52 and theres the college that doesnt give grades out at the quarter Math 94(Algebra 2 at the college) B   but yea in American Studies which is the english/history class i just did about 250 points extra credit on top of all the work due so i have an A in that and in Forensics i raised my grade about 3% which was enough to bump me to an A-, but at the college i think i just failed my test so i probably have a C in that class but i might have to drop it because of a lack of time. but if i keep it up ill have a "4.0" for the first time in my life. YAY!!!and if i drop the class i can get a job!!!
