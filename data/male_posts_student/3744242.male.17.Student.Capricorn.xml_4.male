When I went in today to see who I could switch with, the only person that was available to work that time and still be able to switch with me has been erased off the schedule!  He even owes me one because I switched with him once.  Now I have no chance of getting that day off.  I really don't think they want me working that day anyway.  I would have to run to the bathroom about even...30 seconds because of the medications I have to take.  Oh, sorry, for those who don't know, I have to have both an endoscopy and a colonoscopy... AT THE SAME TIME!  The prep work I have to go through the day before the procedure has only one purpose, to clean out my system entirely.  This means no eating or drinking anything but clear fluids for that whole day.  The medication makes it so that all the food already in there comes out...as soon as possible.  Now, doesn't that just put a pretty picture into your head.  Then the next day, the day of the procedure, I have to have an IV in my arm.  Now, I am terrified of needles and I don't mind admitting it.  Apparently my parents thought it would calm my fears by telling me I would have an IV, but it didn't really help...at all.  Wow, those are going to be two fun filled days!  I'm kind of looking forward to camp, even though I have one of the worst kids in the entire world in my group first sessions...again.  This kid just does not know how to listen.  He is constantly doing the opposite of what you tell him to do and is always wandering off where he should be going.  Yeah, I know that sounds like a normal kid, but this kid does it more often and sometimes to just piss me off.  Oh well, it only for two weeks...two long weeks...two horribly long weeks.  Well, the night is still young and I'm off to see Dodgeball.  So...leave me alone.  Out
