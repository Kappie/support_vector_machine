They are, without a doubt, the  tightest ,  groovin'ist , funkiest  band that this groove-machine of a bass player has ever heard. Seriously IM me people and I'll send you some of their stuff. I want you all to hear this. It's beyond incredible how good this band is. Imagine, if you will, all the funk of a 1970's Black Detective primetime action show, add on the powerful sound of the oakland soul influence of Tower of Power, without a doubt the tightest horn section ever assembled, and top it off with the occasional turntable and freestyle rap interlude. There you have, as I must say for the third time, the tightest band in the history of music. This band exceeds "well oiled machine"-- they're a Silicon fucking Chip!...(I'm still not doing them justice... not by a long shot) Please, folks, you need to shake your asses to this stuff. Contact me and I will GLADLY hook you up!
