My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand. I and the Father are one."   For those who don't know or don't remember, the last discussion group was on peace. The verse above provides me much peace. Those of us who have accepted that offer of eternal life are recipients of those benefits mentioned above. Nothing and nobody can separate us from God. No matter what happens, God keeps my spirit secure, and my eternity as well. If God can keep my spirit firmly in His grasp, then I can be sure that He can keep the rest of my being - the physical, mental, social, emotional, and academic parts, secure as well. If my eternity is secure in the salvation He provides, then I can be sure that He is also in control of the brief time I have been alloted on this earth.   Basically, what I am saying is this: if He can handle the most important parts of my existence, then the smaller things really are no issue. I have experienced Peace when I realize that God is always in control; I take comfort in knowing that He has a plan for my life, and that I will end up wherever He wants me to be. Even when times are bad... even when I see everything falling apart around me... I find solace in knowing that He is with me, and that, eventually, everything will be alright. I know that, when you're in the situation, you can't see the end of it... the way out. This is where faith kicks in. You just have to trust that God has got it down.
