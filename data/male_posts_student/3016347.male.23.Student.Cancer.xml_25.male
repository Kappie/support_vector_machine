Hope u will be happy, i am really sincere...........i really wish u could be happy always. any of her decisions, even if i do not agreed with her, i will still support her......i will scold lah but then wat can i do?! duh............................... happy always!! the world wont wait for u, u have to move on and do things u never did. hmm.........there are things i never did before, get drunk, a gf, buy a house, buy my own car, decorate my own house and garden, have my own kids.........haha..... there is so many things tat i never did......hmm...... i have wasted so much my time..............on......nvm. must get it asap!!!! :)   ps- i didnt mention any of her problem cos i have promised her.
