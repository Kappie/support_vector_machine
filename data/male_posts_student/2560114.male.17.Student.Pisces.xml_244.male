During the classic tourney, i guess i didnt put that much effort into playin...i need to get back in my focused mode. Hopefully at Junior Olympics, i can really show the college scouts what i can really do...i just have to work harder at the next few practices before j.o.'s. I'm really considering goin to emmanuel to play there, but first ill c what opportunities i will have once the summer is over...then i will make my decision about where i am goin to play in college. I really would like to play opposite hitter cuz at classic, i had a higher hitting percentage hittin from the opposite than hitting from the middle and outside. Also this could give me an opportunity to get more blocks and become a release if brian needz help. But mainly i jus need to b focused on vball at j.o.'s...100%. After the matches are over, then ill think of other stuff. But when we're playin, i jus have to think about "doin what i know i can do, dont overdo it, jus play, have fun."...thats all i got to think. Also, concerning about the team, we jus need to stop freakin out and stop tryin to overdo thingz...jus play the game on a steady tempo and realize our tendancies...i know minez already(can't hit over the block, hittin middle back, not bending my elbow, not pressin on blockin sometimez, and other thingz)...i jus need to work on tryin to correct them during the next few dayz...so until them...the saga continuez...
