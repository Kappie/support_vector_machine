By the way, I'm online because someone in the area was nice enough to provide a wireless internet connection that wasn't password protected. Possibly Kelly's family, possibly someone else. Oh well.   Today many things happened. Ryan's jaw is rotting. My dad blew the lighting for my entire wing of the house, and my mom poured antifreeze into my car's coolant tank.  Kelly is at the door, so she's probably about to leave, so I better wrap this up. This whole wireless in the driveway is cool, and if I don't blog while there, I'll talk to you guys later.
