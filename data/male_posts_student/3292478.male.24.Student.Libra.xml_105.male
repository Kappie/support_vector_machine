Jonathon was orphaned in March after his parents were caught peddling crack cocaine across the Colombian/Arctic border. Their public beheading left little Jonathon feeling withdrawn and confused, and it took me a few weeks to get him talking again.  But now Jonathon is like a new penguin, and is due to feature in the new James Bond film as the Bond girl  Frosty McCrotch . A comedy tour is scheduled around Christmas with support from  'Pingu and the Pinguettes' !  I'm thinking of getting myself a duck too!   Pop over to  urlLink bunnyherolabs  and adopt yourself a wee animal!
