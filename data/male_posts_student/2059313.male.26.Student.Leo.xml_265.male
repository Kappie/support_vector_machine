Yeah, sorry, there's still very little to be told that I haven't already.  Starting Jan 15, 2003,  urlLink Studio Players  is producing a show called  OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY .  I have designed the lights for the show, and I'm very excited about seeing it on it's feet.  I'd also love to see a lot of people in the audience that I know to see my first full-fledged lighting design.  Spread the word.  Other People's Money at Studio Player's in Lexington.  January 15 thru February 1.
