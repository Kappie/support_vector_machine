It's because of this that whenever the news comes onto the TV, I immediatly switch into day dream mode and ignore all that is being said.  Imagine my horrification when yesterday I actually bothered to give a damn and watch the news. A man is put in jail for slashing the kneck of his 10 month year old son, a teenager is sentenced to life imprisonment for stabbing a fellow school pupil in the heart, everydayabout30reports of animal abuse come into the RSPCA (it might only add up to just under 11000 reports a year but why should their be this minority at all?).  I'd heard of terrorist attacks, I'd heard of riots and rebellions but these things are done for the cause of religion and freedom. As bad as they are they have some sort of reasoning behind them. But where is the reasoning behind the headlines I heard yesterday? Why would anyone kill their 10 year old son? Why would a teenager stab an (as far as I know) innocent school pupil? Why be cruel to animals that have done nothing against you?  It makes no sense to me other than the people who commit these crimes have some sort of mental disease and they are incapable of thinking likenormal people.  It makes me wonder if I was wrong. Perhaps the afterlife isn't hell for all. Perhaps we're already there.
