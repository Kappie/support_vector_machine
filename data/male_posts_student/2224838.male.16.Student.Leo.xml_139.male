But, as always, we were short on ideas and short on money. When his birthday came around and we were without a gift, we were forced to settle for making him dinner and dessert. Now that Father's Day is here, we are yet again unprepared. So, I gave him the next best thing to a gift. I made him some more food. Pancakes and eggs to be exact. I also made an extra effort to go to church with him this morning for the first time in over a month. It was the least that I could do...   Anyway, here is another free gesture. Happy Father's Day dad!
