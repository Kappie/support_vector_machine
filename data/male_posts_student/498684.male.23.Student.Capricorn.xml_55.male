Some religious people say that men have to not fear of anything except  GOD . This is a nice prophesies I believe, however did we try to define what  GOD  is? We assume that every body knows the meaning of God! The power far-far beyond of human’s power in this word. But I have another proposition for answer to this question:  I say we shouldn’t fear of anything except  ourselves .  Really did you ever thing which it might be we are God? See in my religion God say to human that I am as close as your neck to you. I always ask myself what is a close as my neck to me? And you know what my answer was? It was me! Or I hear a lot of times which if you want to know God, know yourself. So in fact we can say we still afraid of God if we fear of ourselves. Although what is fear?  Maybe fear is some sort of respect. Actually we don’t afraid of those we respect to but we make difference between them and other who we don’t respect. So it is possible all meaning of fear was respect. And in some point this definition has changed. In conclusion you are the God, so respect your God.   Respect yourself.
