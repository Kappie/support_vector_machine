I have no idea how to even think about them properly... not depressed, I promise.  *stretches* And so once again I sit here, in front of my computer, unaware of what to do other than metaphorically cling on to the virtual rope that is the internet. It makes no difference that the rope itself does not at the moment contain, wound inside it, any of the answers, and it probably won't tomorrow. It makes little difference that the entire being an emotional wreck thing isn't... entirely attractive. It makes very little difference that sitting here, typing this, means very little to me. Tonight, I look beyond this internet and take a moment to look outside my window.  Overcast, cloudy, black, the skies display none of the stars Brendan loves so much. But they're there, just subtley hidden behind a thin veil that, although it cannot be taken away, can be broken by itself. The beams of light exist beyond what we can see, what we can percieve, but even so we know they're there. Similarly I know there's something good about the particular situation I'm in, perhaps a sort of reciprocation. However, I can't see anything, so I don't know what it is. But I know that it "IS".  Love, Jon Roskilly
