This post's gonna flow. Like a flow chart.  Firstly, Mattson didn't put up the thinker like he said he would. I need some thinking. It helps clear my sinuses. Also, that football variation was awesome.  I'm pumped for the Goat match on Sunday. We oughta strategerize, but I'm fairly confident that 8 guys flowing up the field can take about anything. A few defensive snipers and we'll be good. Also, as far as a slayer match would go, we'd have to go 5 on 5 to not afford them oodles of slaughters, and I volunteer myself and the Oselands to sit those ones out, being, as we are, the 3 worst players, esp. as far as just kills go.   Somehow, someway, Matt Houle thinks we may get an Xbox. Like the special Halo edition one or something like that. Furthermore, Hawkeye is feeling his need for Halo. It would be awesome if he were to join our parties as oft as possible.  On the topic of Hawkeye... who is she? I think I sensed some serious longing and fear in that poem. There's gotta be a girl behind it somewhere. It's a secret that's tearing this man apart.  So whether or not that was true or just a good segue to this point: one easy way to spice this place up, not to mention add diversity, would be to throw some estrogen factors in here, if you know what I mean. And I don't know how you couldn't... Really, though, if any female could stand us, it would certainly be interesting.   That's about as far as it flows. I picked up three awesome sheet music books from Bridge of Harmony, music from the 60's, 70's, and an Elvis collection. There's a bunch of Elton and Billy and whatnot, including Piano Man.   As of May 31st, my employment with Culver's of Baxter reached one year. Today I actually trained another guy in to Fryers position. I've also started working Buns and may start on grill. I've moved back to the kitchen, which beats about any front position ten times over.  I'm totally hooked on Stranger in a Strange Land. There were 5 Heinlein books on the readers' selections on Hobe's brother's list, but 0 on the boards'. I've already read 1 1/2, and have another on hold. After I've spent about all of Mr. Science Fiction, as I guess he's called, I plan to move onto Slaughterhouse Five and maybe some Hemingway if I can stomach it. I gotta fit One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in there somewhere also.    "Kissing girls is a goodness. It is a growing-closer.
