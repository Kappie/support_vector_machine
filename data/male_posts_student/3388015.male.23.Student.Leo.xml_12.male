I suggested "Super Size Me", a documentary about a guy who ate only McDonald's for a month.  I was looking to getting my Earthlink Cable internet disconnected but they asked if they could give me a free month instead.  Whatever, at least I'll have an easy transition from the old apartment to the new.  I can keep the cable modem while I move and give it back before they give me a new one on the new account.  Hopefully I can get the $30/month deal again at the new place.  Cindy and I left Rochester for Irondequoit in search of planting material.  Laura suggested we check out a couple small green hatcheries in the areas.  But she was eating dinner, so we decided to waste time at Walmart, our Rochester getaway.  However, after getting slightly misdirected off of 104, I found my way to Taco Bell.  But we didn't go to just Taco Bell, the McDonald's was right next door.  So Cindy got McD and I got tacobell and we ate like kings.  However, it was really slow, the ice machine was haunted and they gave me the two largest bean burritos I have ever seen.  These things put Ragin' Burrito to shame.  We went to Walmart and found soil, seeds, cat toys (for my new kitten next week) and bikes.  I'm still not sure which bike to buy, we'll see.  Mom has offered $100 toward a bike, so I need to pick one soon.  I ain't walking to work.  Well, I might.  I do need to workout more.  Doesn't Cindy look good on this bike?   urlLink     Gas was only $2.07 at the SuperKiss, so I filled up.  We then found our way back to 104 and stopped at Laura and Luke's place.  We stayed a long time, watched TV, played on the computers, talked, drank all their water and soda.  I told Luke about the Verizon Wireless Quick2Connect service, qnc, that is included with all Verizon phone plans.  It lets you connect your laptop to the internet through the cell phone for free any time anywhere while in their digital network.  We worked for 2 hours to get it working.  We couldn't get it to work.  It would connect, but our username/password was wrong.  I gave up, we left, I dropped Cindy off, and returned home.  Luke called and told me he finally got it to work, the username and password were both qnc.  Argh!  The one combo we didn't try.  Alas, now I can spread the news.  Off to bed, while Jake is cheating his way to the top of Champions of Norath without me.  I invited him to a small picnic I want to hold Thursday or Wednesday at our apartment, but he didn't think he could make the time to spend dinner with his friends.  Hopefully Laura and Cindy are interested, otherwise I'll be eating along come the picnic!  Night.  Quote:   Directions : Place rocks or broken clay pieces in bottom of pot.  Cover with soil.  Cindy : So what should I put in the bottom of the flower pot instead of that?  Luke : Perhaps pieces of your broken heart?  Cindy : Or my hopes and dreams?
