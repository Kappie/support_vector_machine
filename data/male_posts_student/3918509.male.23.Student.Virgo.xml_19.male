In a major subplot of the movie, we discover that a character named Agnis (played by Judi Dench) was raped by her brother when she was 12 years old and is now a lesbian rather hostile towards men. I applaud whoever it was in Hollywood who dared to make the politically incorrect implication that her (admittedly affirmed) homosexuality was the result of the sexual abuse.  If only people would pay attention.  When will liberals quit clinging to the "it's genetic" claim and acknowledge the fact that much of homosexuality (especially lesbianism) is the result of sexual abuse? And when will conservatives ingest this fact and begin responding to homosexuals with compassion rather than condemnation?
