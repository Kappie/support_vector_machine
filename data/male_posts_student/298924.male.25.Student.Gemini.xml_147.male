Oh well.....so the Rhodes furniture people call me at too early o'clock to tell me that they will be delivering my table this morning....so I got up and did what I shoulda done Saturday and vacuumed the floor....now all I can think about is "what if my table is too big for my lil ass apartment....what will I do!!......I think I'm just being paranoid though.....  The new freshmen have their White Coat Ceremony today....it reminds me of how we got shafted last year....every other class here at Meharry has had embroidered coats with the Meharry seal on the left side....our class got plain white coats with a damned cheap ass name tag and a pin....I know it's petty but hell I'm a petty dude....these suckas bet not have embroidered coats or I'mma kick up some sand....  I'm going to upload all the wonderful pictures I took/will take today sometime this weekend so you all (all 10 of you) can see the beautiful people (and I mean that quite literally) that I go to school with....med school has some great looking women!  More to say later!
