"Everyone is talking like this Yanks-Sox race is settled, but it's only July 1, folks. And if you hate the Yanks the way Jim Caple does and love the Red Sox as much as Bill Simmons does you'll want to hold onto these numbers: The Yankees have scored 415 runs through Wednesday, the Red Sox have scored 409; The Yankees have given up 357 runs, the Red Sox have allowed 358. Yes, there's a 7.5-game gap in the standings, but the gap rests on only seven runs difference in terms of performance. This thing is tight. The difference now is a little luck, and a little better job by the Red Sox of driving in runners in scoring position. Luck could decide to take a dance with Boston any time, and the gap in the standings could close right back up."  In other news, I can take a point of pride in noting that, of his all-bargain all-star team, I have Chone Figgins, Bobby Crosby, Michael Young, and Victor Martinez on my fantasy (rotisserie) baseball team (and had Lew Ford until I swapped him for Chone Figgins -- Kevin Youkilis, who had been my third baseman, is going to be a bit squeezed for playing time with Billy Mueller back).  Crosby, Young, and Martinez all came out of my draft (AL-only league), and I picked up Ford on waivers.  If only the folks I picked up in the first few rounds would work out, then I'd be set.  I certainly didn't waste my 4th round pick on Eric Hinske.  Not me.
