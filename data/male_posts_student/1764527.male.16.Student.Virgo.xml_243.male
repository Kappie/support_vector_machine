 I know this sounds really nasty, but it's all good. I just brushed my teeth for the first time since last Sunday. Doesn't that sound disgusting? LOL, naw, it's because of getting my wisdom teeth cut out and how I've had four wounds in my mouth since Monday. I've been real careful about what I've ate and used salt-water gargles and some prescription mouth wash whenever necessary. Surprisingly, I haven't needed to brush, not to mention the risk involved in a toothbrush ripping open one of the surgical sites. 
 Pleasant talk before I go back to the oral surgeon for a follow-up visit.
