I'm trying to modify the template but for some reason it's not quite working out as it should.  I'm trying to add a pic to the side as a side border thing but it is strange...  It works when I Preview the template, but not when I load the actual site.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I hope I figure it out soon.  Not a big deal yet since the picture I've been making is pretty much crap anyway heh.  So much for the days when I used to be proud to write my websites in Notepad.  Ah well...
