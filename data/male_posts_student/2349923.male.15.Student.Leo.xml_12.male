The performance, placed in comparison to last year's, is way much better.  Thanks guys. Please do take an approach as serious as this from now on. The teamwork i see is immensly infinite. If it is strengthened even further, you guys will soon become elites of the school. Any more, you might want to go to  urlLink my blog to see my post. There, you can get some pictures.  Well, in the mean time, i want you guys to carry on the great job. And i seriously want to hear good news and comments after each of your parades from your Sec3NCOs.  Talking abt ur sec 3 NCOs, please give them their due respect as if to me. Though my official squad is sec 2, i've trained the sec3 NCOs as whole-heartedly as i've trained you guys. So that they could be at their top form to train you guys. They have worked extremely hard for me, which is for you. So whenever you feel like rebelling the sec threes, think of me and the hard work i've invested in the secondary threes for you.  The current NCO team is a team of outdoor skills experts. And you guys lack in outdoor skills, so this is the best configuration you can get.  Good Luck!
