I'm going to stay neutral this time. I swear it. If anyone catches me being partial in anyway, please tell me, because I really don't want to be. I just don't want to go there. I'll make it worse, we all know that. I'm sorry, but I can't. If you talking to me is going to try and change this, please just don't. Shitty stuff hurts so much more when you're foolishly involved in them.  I met a Japanese Jew today. She's in my Honors Astronomy class. She's a sweetie. We were talking about languages, religion, and astronomy. All rather predicatable topics, but I don't really have anything else to say here.
