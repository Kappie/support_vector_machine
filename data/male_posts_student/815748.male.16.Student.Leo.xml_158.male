Also I've been waiting for this CD to be there that keeps getting away from me.  Ms. Srikanth is so cool; on Tuesday we're going to have a long-block playtime.  Today I finished  L'Etranger , which turned out well.  Not well like happy ending but well like good ending.  Also, I have announced officially my candidacy for Secretary-General of Model UN.  I wrote my campaign speech today, and I have several good ideas for how to improve the club.  For example:      1. A Model UN blog, on which all members will be able to post their views on the issue.      2. The usage of Webpost.com to put working papers and resolutions online, linked from a central place on the aforementioned blog.      3. The usage of AIM to have group discussions– which, unlike Yahoo! Messenger, people actually have.      4. The introduction of topics the week of the voting of the previous one, allowing delegates a chance to prepare before each first issue meeting.   We have a lot of words that end in the same thing... like '-son.'  I don't know what it means, but... --- Ms. Heidlage
