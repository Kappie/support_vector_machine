I embarked on my retail journey in the heart of the Sydney CBD by visiting a couple of old stamping grounds. As you can see the gear on offer for both the fellas and the ladies this year is nothing short of awesome! Jackets, pants, boards, boots, goggles, gloves, bindings.

Man the tow-ropes back up can be tough!! Just kidding to all the first timers, we all started there!! But for those of us who need the gear to combat the elements at the top of 'International', or even better 'The Saddle' at Whistler-Blackcomb, this apparrel is essential for battling the harsh elements delivered when reaching summits.
