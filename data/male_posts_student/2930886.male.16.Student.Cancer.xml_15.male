I took my old book coer and flipped it inside out. An easy 5 extra credit points, and the person who gets it next year gets shanked. so i figure about 100 maybe a 101. English wasnt that bad for the most part, the Essay what will killed me because it is poorly written and it is not very good. Not bad i am lazy and i dont want to make too muhc noise plus i have over 40 minutes left here.
