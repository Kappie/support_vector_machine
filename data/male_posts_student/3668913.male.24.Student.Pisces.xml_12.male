When I look into your eyes,  I can see hopes and dreams, of stars in eternity, of the day when you step into your Father's court to receive the crown of glory.  When I look into your eyes, I can see a love so dear,  so gentle and yet so clear for your future Bridegroom and all His glory and for His pair of nail pierced hands.   May the day come that  When I look into your eyes, I see your tears of joy, that God has blessed you with someone, who will go with you to watch the stars, and to hold and cherish you in times both good and bad and may the day come, that you'll say "yes" to the one who's always looking into your eyes, and wishing that you know  you are so dear in his heart.
