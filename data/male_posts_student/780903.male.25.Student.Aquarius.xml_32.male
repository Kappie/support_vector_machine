I decided to comparison shop for my textbooks on the Internet, quickly finding that (a) they're all expensive, (b) regardless what site you buy them from.  So I think I'll wait and try my luck with used books in the Harvard bookstore.  By my rough calculation, retail price of the books for my 4 classes should be about $700.  But how can someone feel guilty about buying textbooks -- again, after what tuition costs, everything is cheap, and besides, you have to buy textbooks, there are no options here, it's a necessary cost... but if I can save $10 by buying something used, I'll at least feel like I'm allowed to go see a movie.
