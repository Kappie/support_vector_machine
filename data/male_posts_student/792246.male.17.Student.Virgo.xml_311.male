Doesn't she know that a mother's role is in the home pampering the stupid daughter with baked goods?  So here I am, babysitting her even though we have a paid babysitter sitting not three feet away from me. So yeah. We're stuck watching my sister be in this dumb "Rock Musical". It's about rocks. Get it? Get it? Ohh.  I hate watching kids in musicals. It's painful. I have guilt about ever being in one and making my parents feel like they ever had to go to one.  I need to go to school. But she's not letting me leave until her friend shows up at an unspecified time in the next like 20 minutes. Even if she has no real power keeping me here, I know if I leave this babysitter will have so much shit to deal with, so her retarded begging works on me.  No one over the age of 5 should start screaming and crying every time my mother has to go somewhere.
