Well tomorrow in between services I need to go get Diana's info for a reference.  Guess what!!!  Gap and Old Navy=SAME COMPANY!!!  (same discount) YES!!! Barnes  Noble discount too and Banana Republic but it is doubtful i will be able to shop there with a discount lol.  !!!At pacsun there was this rack that said 9.99 on it so I asked if everything on it was 9.99 cuz it was wicked nice stuff that i have wanted all winter and she said YES!!!  wow unfortunately my excursion that was meant to earn money ended up with me buying a rack of clothing at PacSun but how can you pass up 9.99 for really nice sweaters, jackets, dress shirts and long-sleeve tees??  The answer:YOU CANT!!!
