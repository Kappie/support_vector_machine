Paul and Sieckman showed up a little later and we continued drinking...  We then headed to meet Finkle, Aaron, Kristen, Carolyn and some other folks up at Incredibowl...  Drank a litle bit more there..  socialized a little bit then Claudia and I headed back to my place drunk out of our minds and thats where the night ended.. Sat night I went and saww the Lord of the Rings: The Two Tower with McKay, His Girl, and Osty.  It was fairly dissapointing.  Sunday night I worked then went to Paddy's to see Welzenbach who was in town for a short while. That is always nice..  We hung out and talked for a while then went to Coach's where we saw Big Maroon and Joe Dirr they had just lost 50 bucks in pool and were pissed about it..  If you see Maroon ask him about it.. It's a good story.. We then saw Doug the bartender at the Peanut and he said Me and Sieckman could come back.. neat..  I still think it was more of me boycotting than me not being able to come back.. but whatever..  then the last few days I have felt like shit and done nothing but sleep, eat and watch TV..  I am so lazy...  OK well it is off to wait for Santa to bring me all his bobble heads and Simpsons figures...  Yeah me...
