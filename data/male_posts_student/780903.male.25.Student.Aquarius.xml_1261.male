Basically, they wear brightly colored jackets and yell at each other.  Think a racetrack, without the horses.  Or a casino, but with a clock.  Or a cockfight, but without the chickens.  That one may work the best, since there are rings where people trade, and stuff like that -- and, I assume, there are rings at cockfights where the animals fight.  I guess.  I think the only cockfight I've seen was in the movie "Fight Club," and I only saw half of the movie, so maybe I'm imagining the cockfight.  I have no idea.
