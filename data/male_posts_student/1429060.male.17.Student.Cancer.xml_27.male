I have been struck with the minor issue of summer assingments compounded with the new school year at White Station High Prison (f***ing da** son of a b**** of a school - sorry about that). My schedule is quite evil, it despises me, I don't get enough of those with connections to DOY because I see Robin in Economics, Brock in Engish, Alanna and Becca at Lunch, and NOTHING OF ELISE OR LAYLEE ON A REGULAR BASIS! damn school system  Upperclassmen get their own lockers - I have the power.  Tomorrow is Becca's kick-ass gig at Java. She is the main attraction, she has her own time and place, and every person who knows her well will probably be there. Even those who don't know her well might be there (e.g., me). I just have to escape dinner and I am there for the action. Par-tay, I daresay.  DOY's server is finally back online, which is a thing that is quite happy. At least I have some connection in my screwed up isolated touch-tone dead end life.  I wrote another poem with the intention of mimicking that which I wrote for the last post.   Hallways stretch in multiple turns that fold back upon human cholesterol, membrane walls in a Golgi apparatus that resembles the cross section of a color- coded blood cell in page who-gives-a-damn of my biology textbook.  Sometimes the graphite scratches on notebook paper ooze red ink like the educational ichors staining the white lines. Odd how it is that even as a sheet of papyrus wipes out a rainforest and kills count 100, 200, 300 species it can still find the strength to make a neat slit on the end of my index finger.  The only places you can find legal euphoria these days are Nevada, California, Oregon: the Rockies don’t need pimps as long as the prostitutes sign their forms and bars give you a shot of oxygen for a healthier intoxication.  Cascade Mountains have plenty of shrinks who help you get the suicidal medicines when the Pacific rains begin to hurt the mind, I am still waiting on the inclement weather perfect for my next evolution.  I scream toward the light post from the safety of locked doors just to reaffirm that I have a voice, I have a voice, but I’ve forgotten how to use it when the world dances in a crazed fury of pollution and suffocation and dreams are shattered like ice.  Warrior three pose resembles a cloud leap suspended over one knee and monks in Asia undergo brain readings for beta waves but I can never meditate for more than ten minutes, my senses stay alive and every pause of the air conditioner springs the mentality from caramel visions.  Forgetfulness would be more bliss than I can get when I wander hunched over with one pendant of books and another of socialistic response, people expect my shoulders to be thrown back with pride when gravity becomes a foe.  My legs have weeds slowly crawling up, caresses of a seductress who gnaws at my sanity. I stumble in a corridor where sexuality just killed sense by strangulation and the ominous perfume of illegal cigarettes of tobacco, of pot, of whatever the hell can be used to bong chokes my supply of air.  Dreams can be nightmares, but I have almost no night escapades to reassure me that I am not in a coma. When he dances, she dances, my heart begins to breathe and I can clear my eyes of iodine and dishonesty to hear sweet sighing of a guitar string.  I sometimes pretend I lie in a huddle with a pool slowly spreading from my wrists, I can draw the image now and tear it up because she sat next to the Random Information Guy giggling and opened my brain with aloe vera fingers to explore my religion of angst and change.   No title for a reason, chaps. Such can make it so very beautifully random if it has no title.  I bid every one of thee a good night, humans. Sleep well in the bliss that allows you to miss school (f***ing da** son of a b**** of a school - sorry about that). Evenin'
