I got the email from Derek at 1:40 this morning saying that he had gotten a call from a detective in Pahrump, NV. The detective had said that Quinn had died from self inflicted gunshot wound. When I heard the news I was devastated. I still am. I have lost someone that was extremely close to me, that I loved. Quinn is gone now, I can't bring that back, but he will always live in my memory.       Quinn Dyer - 1983 - 2003    But on a happier note......I got my permit! Yea! Go me!
