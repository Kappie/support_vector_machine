Anyway God has already given me my calling, and that is to be worship leader. Now if you knew me personally you would probably be as sceptical as I was when I first received my calling. I'm not shy, but I'm not that outgoing ... and well let's just say that I don't fit the profile of someone being in front of the church every Sunday and Wednesday leading a choir. But God told me to do it so I will be obedient to Him.  So right now I'm learning all I can about singing and music period. I've been playing piano for about 4 years, so I know a good bit about music. In fact I might be teaching some beginning lessons this summer. I also have a recital in 3 weeks that I'm really nervous about. So I'm sure that if your going to be reading my blog frequently then you'll be hearing a lot about it.  Anyway I guess I've pretty much covered all there is about me. I have another blog where I just write about my day and stuff.  urlLink God's Work  is what I call it. You can check it out if you want.  So that's pretty much it. I'll be posting later about something exciting.
