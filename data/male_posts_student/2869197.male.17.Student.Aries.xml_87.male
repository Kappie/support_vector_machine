All the computer labs and many good stores have been closed the while due to this "day". But, hey, I ain't complainin'. More power to the working man, yo.  Strangely enough, despite the festivities, I don't really feel that patriotic. Maybe it's the fact that President Bush is destroying my hopes for a smaller government. Maybe it's my general dislike of all pre-emptive warfare. Maybe it's just because there are no formal fireworks displays here in Ann Arbor (WTF). Don't get me wrong, I love America. The freedom, the free education, the light Christian underscoring of everything, the blatant commerialization (scratch that one). But you can't oversimplify a country (Critical Geopolitics 101) and only consider it's postives. Well, I hang my little flag from my backpack in remembrance of all America. Oh, and the parade here's allright.  Money's running low. I'm beginning to fear returning home and having to explain a $170 expenditure to my parents. So I think I'll break it down here, as a lot of small expenses look better than a bunch of big ones.  $35                     Security Deposit $10                     Money lost to the copy card machine demons $12                     Copies actually copied $22                     Video Games (mostly Metal Slugs 4) $21                     Books (all of them on sale) $34                     Snacks and Frappes (mostly frappes) $22                     Dinner on Sundays $10                     New ID Card $6                       Remaining Liquid Funds (these are all extremely wide estimations on my part)  Ah, yes. Forgot to mention. I lost my M-Card. I went to Potbelly's with Emily, bought a sandwich, went to Borders, and returned to the dorms without a M-Card. I scoured my room, Potbelly's, Borders, and found nought. I've come to expect the inevitabliity of my losing things on trips. I'm just thankful it was only my M-Card (so far...).  There are a bunch of homeless people in Ann Arbor, or at least a proportionally higher number than in Roosevelt Parks (surburban middle-class utopia that it is). I wonder about giving money to them. It's obviously quite Biblical to give to the poor, especially when it's not for reputation-building. But I wonder if they really spend the money on gas or food or such or whether they buy drugs and alcohol with it. I'm too gullible to believe they aren't in some need yet too cynical to believe they are decent people. I'll give them change and run, I suppose.
