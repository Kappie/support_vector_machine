Maybe we are supposed to enjoy it and spend it with those we love.  This is an interesting philosophy. Life is a vacation, and it might be true. However these questions come after it: we choose to go to vacation, we know this is not a real life when we are in vacation, and we now exact time to leave the vacation. But in the life, we don’t know we choose or not, we have no idea about another life and of course the end is still unknown too. Although as all instance, it just gives us some points.   1- We should enjoy the life.  2- This life isn’t real.  I know we are suppose to be  happy , but  Does happiness equal to enjoy?
