He still tries to think about his feelings though rather than just let them run wild-if that makes any sense.  But he has been talking to her and just feels that there could be something so special there even though she does not see that.  She is sorta teasing him lately though with her voiced willingness to hang out together but then she never comes through with it.  Take the Apple Cup for instance.  Tyke had an early soccer game but Skippy was at Zena's birthday thingy and Tina was there apparently so when Skippy called Tyke Tina said hi.  That was nice...and Tyke is such a loser that he saved that message.  Man, maybe he is obsessed with her.  Is he?  No, he can't be.  Can he?  Damn, now he feels bad that he is so enamored by her.  Arrgghh, why does he need to feel so?  But on a totally different note, Tyke had a weird dream last night.  It was mainly about Purdy.  It was just weird because of what happened in the dream and how it was Purdy in it instead of Tina.  No, it was not a sex dream though but more of just want Tyke wants with Tina.  Snuggling and some kissing.  But really it was weird because it was Purdy in the dream and Skippy was there too.  Haha, hey Purdy, if you are reading this hey!  Hahahaha...that is funny if you are reading this.  Don't worry it isn't like this dream made Tyke fall head over heels in love with you.  Haha, just odd that the dream had you in it instead of Tina.  Oh well...3 DAY WEEK!  3 DAY WEEK!  3 DAY WEEK!!!!!
