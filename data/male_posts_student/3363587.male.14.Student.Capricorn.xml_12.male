I need to busy my life with something else other than love. Oh how wrong I was to try and start it off long long ago...only to fail in the end...  Tomorrow is a band dae...I'm expecting a few BORING hours of secTionaLs and then combine when the 20 or so peopLe return from the rehearsaL...We're playing so many new songs! Alvamar, Folklore, Inferno...Inferno of which is soOoOoOoOo hard...grade 5 worz...highest grade in band music (or is it?) and if the percussion score can already make you dizzy, what about the woodwinds? Horrifying...LoLz. Alvamar was surprisingly easy to sighTread on the first day...I can't say the same for the rest of the band. I do consider percussion one of the easiest sections in the band (no offense, percussionisTs)  Really looking forward to playing all these songs toMorroW...Wah...my wriTing hand very pain worz...had to copy 4 chinese compos juz nw...punishMenT lahz...stupid mdm wan...aiya...in a rush to go homE...so juZ copy 3 n stuff it in the pigeoN hoLe outside the staff room...  Oh well...that's it...hand pain...cyaZ!
