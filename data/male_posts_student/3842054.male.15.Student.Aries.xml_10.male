I got my schedule early this summer by going into building 2, and finding the secretary lady that sits in that little room the the left of you right when you walk in.       I asked her if I was switched to TV Pro from film cuz i was curious. She told me, and i was (thank god, I changed my mind.) Then she decided to give it to me. Anyone out there who is curious to see it, here it is.      1. Italion II - Kiley   2. AP World History - West   3. TV Production - N/A   4. English II Honors - Imse   5. Algebra II - N/A   6. Debate IV - Weber   7. Chemistry I Honors - N/A      This is a pretty random post... but Alex was wondering so..      Characters   Alex - Good friend that goes to Dreyfoos.          Oh, for those of you looking for one of my daily posts... dont worry, nothing good happened, except i mowed the lawn, and im spending the night at Katies because my mom has to babysit her sisters... cya. Ill post some lyrics if you want though...      Maroon 5   She Will Be Loved      Beauty queen of only eighteen   She had some trouble with herself   He was always there to help her   She always belonged to someone else   I drove for miles and miles   And wound up at your door   I've had you so many times but somehow   I want more   I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain   Look for the girl with the broken smile   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved   She will be loved   Tap on my window knock on my door   I want to make you feel beautiful   I know I tend to get so insecure   It doesn't matter anymore   It's not always rainbows and butterflies   It's compromise that moves us along   My heart is full and my door's always open   You can come anytime you want   I don't mind spending everyday   Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh   Look for the girl with the broken smile   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile   And she will be loved   She will be loved   And She will be loved    And She will be loved   I know where you hide   Alone in your car   Know all of the things that make you who you are   I know that goodbye means nothing at all   Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls   Tap on my window knock on my door   I want to make you feel beautiful   She will be loved (repeated)   Please don't try so hard to say good bye.      This song just came out into a music video. I havent heard good things about it. Great song. Some say its about prostitution... who knows... The different colored lines is a quote that i really like.
