I worked at the Wendy's in Edgewood, Harford County, Maryland, since June 14, 2003, and just quit yesterday, April 23, 2004. Background information to know before I tell the story is that Brian, Patrick, and Dave, a manager and two workers, are all prejudice against white people, believe it or not, and they all work on Friday nights, Dave sometimes does not, though.   Now to tell you what happened: My friend Randy and I both quit because the newest manager, Brian, the one on duty last night, would not work with us and sat in the back all night talking on his cell phone with his girlfriend and whoever else,  and would not give Randy and I breaks when we were supposed to get them because he didn't want to actually work. The managers are supposed to work anyway, so that's not right. Then, Brian kept saying he was going to let me off on time for a change, and that he had a "plan" that included getting me off drive-thru register at 9:30 last night to have me do dishes and be finished them by 10:15 and maybe be able to let me off at 10:30.  Then Patrick (a worker that gets along with Brian really well and), who wasn't working much as well, and Dave (a worker who was just there to hang out with Brian and Patrick, not to be on clock and work) went over and talked to Brian for a while outside by the electric box. By 10:20 I was still on register. I asked Brian what was going on, and he told me to wait it out and he'd get there. Dave started cussing me out and everything, and saying that I was a pansy and a "porkchop" and all kinds of other crap. He said he can't get in trouble for it because he was off the clock. Since I was on the clock I couldn't say anything back. Brian wouldn't let me anyway and would say he wouldn't let me, because obviously he favors Dave. I went back inside to go back to my register, and Randy and I looked out the drive-thru window to see Brian, Patrick, and Dave all walk out by the dumpsters and do something. Randy, after taking a closer look believed they were smoking pot. I seriously believe that too. So we now have three workers that will not work, two of which are on clock, one of the two on clock being a manager, and they are hitting up some pot while they should be working and Brian should be going by his word, and not verbally abusing me. Randy hated his job too. He looked over at me and said, "We should just walk out." I said, "You mean quit?" He said, "Yeah. Let's do it. I'll ask him for my break now, and if he refuses to give me my break, I'm out. If you come too, I'll drive you home. My truck's outside." I agreed, and he asked Brian for his break. He refused the break. Randy said, "Okay, I quit." Brian said, "So you're just going to walk out of the shift?" Randy said, "Yeah. I'm out." Brian said, "Go clock out then and leave." He did and looked at me. I took off my drive-thru headset and said, "I'm out too." Brian said, "So you're quitting too? That means for good. You're not coming back if you do this." I said, "Yeah. I know. I'm out. I quit." I clocked out, walked outside, and hopped in the passenger's side of an already running old Ford F-150 with Randy in the driver's side, and we left. I got home and told my parents the story. They agreed that I had a good reason, and though when I did quit they wanted it to be respectfully with a two-week notice, they understood and agreed that I did the right thing by walking out.   Anyway, I gotta go. Comment me with your thoughts on this and maybe some recommendations on where to go for a new job. Blog ya later!  In Christ, Mike >
