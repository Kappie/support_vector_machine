Nothing has really been the same for a while.  Always on my guard about EVERYTHING.  No really.  Like today in class I was kinda paranoid that someone was looking at my test.  Not like I really care, but still, it was just this weird feeling.  I just feel uncomfortable with everything.  Talking to Sam, talking to my parents, talking with other people.  Situations I just want to avoid.  The application process is still ongoing.  Pain in the butt, but thats what I must do if I want to reach my big goal.  It raining.  Im uncomfortable with the weather.  I thought it would be nice and 70's before humid and 85.  My body doesnt like it.  Sam's quote on her IM is "The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers."  This comes from M. Scott Peck.  But I cant see it.  Im so uncomfortable with everything its not even funny and its only getting worse.  I feel unfulfilled.  I feel empty.  I used to go to people for reassurance, for these truer answers, to know Im loved, but even if they say it, I dont feel it.  I know what I want, but I dont know what Im looking for.  Anyone have one of those days?  Yeah.  Sorry.  I know this is alot to dump on an open forum, but its how Ive decided that Im going to be.  Heart on my sleeve, no lies, no bullshit.  But some things are better left unsaid.  Too bad you dont even know the half of it...  So the real question is, so now what?
