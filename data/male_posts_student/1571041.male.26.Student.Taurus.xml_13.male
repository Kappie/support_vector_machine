I wonder if I'm getting sick?  Okay, so I'm looking over some of my past writtens, and I'm still amazed.  Those poems are really good.  I mean, I'm looking at them like I didn't even write them.  It's like I'm a fan of my own work?  I wish things would work out to where I can just sit down and write all kinds.  I don't have the time, or even motivation though, especially now that I'm just dragging all kinds.  But, the event for the day is to try and make it 15 miles up north to go to the tribal optomitrist.  I had my chance this morning, but that's about the time I actually started to get some rest.  I'm trying to figure out who has a ride, and also who has the time to drive me around?  I hope I get a ride, because I need this to keep my job.
