It's a free paper, and it will print any article that community members send in, so i suppose it's best described as a printed public forum. The article im currently working on is about the lies spread by the authorities before a large protest and the mistreatment that activists are faced with because of the police force. It will be the first I've written for The Voice and I plan on writing alot for the paper, if they will have me. Anyways, I'm going to go and e-mail my little essay to the editor, so I'll post something new tommorrow.      Solidarity, rebels.    August Spies
