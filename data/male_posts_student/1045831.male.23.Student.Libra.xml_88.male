He put on a hell of show and rocked the house with some crazy country tunes.  I of course was unreal drunk and was pouring beer down my throat about as fast as I could get my hands on it.  Me and Toms are unreal drunk so we go to meet his Girlfriend at Fatso's where she was supposed to give us a ride home.  She had already left and since it was dollar night and we already paid 2 bucks to get in we decided to sit down and grab a few beers.  After a few more beers and us realizing we could barely stand we figured we should find some way to get home.  I begin calling all kinds of kids in my house and get a ride but just then Whitney shows up with her friend so we are good.  Butsince they came all the way there we figured hell have a few more beers.  So by the time I'm home I am lit up like a torch.  When I get home my roommate is smashed and has this girl he's seeing over so I of course make some crazy comments but since we're all drunk everyone enjoys it and off to bed.    My roomie and I have a 9:30 class on thursday which he is supposed to drive too and since he is the responsible one out of us I put it on him to wake me up. Dumb move..  We miss our class and it turns out afternoon classes for school is cancelled as well so what does my whole house decide to do with this nice break from school?  Catch up on homework maybe..  no..  A Hawaiian party breaks up and our house fills with beer and women and tons of drunks..  so this is 2 nights in a row of being wasted.  I wake up Friday morning bright and early to my alarm but I guess the past two nights have killed some of my much needed brain cells because I couldn't for the life of me remember why I had set my alarm.  So I went back to bed.  My roommate wakes up comes out and sees me asleep on the couch and does the gentlemanly thing by waking me up and saying, Zeke what are you doing don't you have class?  Ohh yeah that's why I woke up so I went off to my full day of class and then back home in pain from my awful hangover.  So I try to take a nap it doesn't work and hey we have a party that night so I get dressed up in the same Hawaiian gear as the night before (It did happen to be a pajama party but who cares Hawaiian Santa is for every occasion)  I forgot to mention that I had been wearing a Santa hat most of this time.  So I go to the party..  get way drunker than I should and head home in a daze still to see what is all going on.  I finally decide to go to bed to get a good nights sleep when I hear a loud noise outside and some knocking on all the doors.  I look out my window and there is like 50 guys on our Lawn.  SO I jump out of bed and wake my roommate up and head out to see what the fight is about.  I pull a bunch of guys in my house off a bunch of other guys and try to get a chance to head back inside so I could recover.  Everyone leaves after 7, that's right 7, cop cars show up to our house.  I head upstairs and spend another hour talking to one of the guys in the other house that I worked with at Waterway about what it was about.  It ended up being a stupid drunk frat penis measuring contest but ohh well..   IN the end a bunch of guys got bruised and bloodied and some other people were pissed about it but none of our guys had a scratch on them so we went to bed happy.  The rest of the weekend was spent in front of the TV, sleeping, Playing poker or reading and now I'm off to bed to prepare myself for the excrutiatingly long day I have tomorrow...  I hope all you kids have had as exciting a weekend as I have and sorry I haven't updated this thing more but I will try to.. just haven't been coherent enough or feeling well enough to do it until now..  Peace..
