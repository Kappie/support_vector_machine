Everything is green and fresh unlike the brown stuff in Aus at the moment.  the water really does go down the toilet in the opposite direction!  Everyone here is very nice and welcoming and i am able to understand at least half of the things that they say. i never knew i could speak american.  If anyone ever goes to LA airport then i suggest that they ask someone who knows what they are talking about for directions. (this excludes other passengers, police, customs officers, flight attendents, check-in and check-out staff, cab drivers, bus drivers, information desk staff and buskers. about the only thing that knows how to get from terminal 4 to terminal 1 is a map and even then it takes about half an hour.  im going to bed.
