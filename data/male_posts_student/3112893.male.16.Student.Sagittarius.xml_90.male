It's the most fucking obnoxious state in terms of every fucking set of laws that one can imagine. Their marriage laws are fucking retarded, their divorce laws are fucking retarded, their tax laws are fucking retarded, their business laws are fucking retarded, their miscellaneous laws and principals are fucking retarded and most importantly to me right now, their driving laws are fucking retarded. Supposedly, even if you have a full out-of-state license, but are younger than 18, you have to go through their whole stupid fucking set of driving laws or just never take employment or residence in CA. It just gets under my skin and I'm no saying this as some elitist north-east coasty. I've lived there for while, and I still live there. It's things like that that make me what to just kill entire coastlines.  Wow, I need to cool off.  Deep breathe... Long exhale... Deep breathe... Long exhale... Woooo... woooo... much better.  I feel much better now.  That is all. -- Feanor
