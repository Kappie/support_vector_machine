Can't go to NSLC Medicine and Health Academy, my parents don't have the cash... BOO!  Well, it isn't like many peeps have $1825 dollars lying around, But I am pissed because they broke another promise... But, anyways tehe... Jared thanks so much sweetie this is for you!  Glass Rose  This fragile rose is for the brokenhearted A symbol of love that is always departed This fragile rose woven of simply most pure glass A symbol of civility and of heartbreak's great mass  The petals are laden with suffering and of pain Like being caught soaking from all pouring rain Glistening water droplets burden it with fears Like most many times alone we shed our tears This rose of clarity, spoiled, scratched up from all of the abuse Like all the many that we have loved that simply were obtuse Thorns once sharp dulled all the way through Like many loves that remind us to start anew The leaves once brilliant emerald have dulled to jade Like scars of love's battles with simply our own aide  The stem fractured slightly from all lost love Gives us hope still like wings of a white dove This rose even in its deteriorating condition Reminds us of love's great renewing position This rose still stands, true and strong as can be That love is still there amidst all of our adversity A poignant reminder of freedom and we can simply start up again If only you find, that one person that fits perfectly into your hand  Love yall!~~Will
