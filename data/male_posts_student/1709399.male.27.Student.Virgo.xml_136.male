India's spectacular win against Australia today has been made possible by one Man . They call him the "Great Wall of India ". He says "I don't have the Super Talent of Sachin or the flurry of strokes like Laxman ". That is Dravid for you . The ever modest Mr.Dependable . Life is not just about Talent. Its perseverance and Hard-work which can bridge the gap between Success  talent. Dravid has been the most consistent scorer for India in the last two years . Earlier he had the habit of getting into a shell which he has over come thankfully these days. A wonderful thinker of the game , I salute him for his consistency  hard-work. He deserves all the praise which is being reaped on him.                                       As Thomas Alva Edison said "Genius is 1% inspiration  99% perspiration ".
