I couldn't remember if the gym was closed on mon/wed or tue/thur for some retarded weightlifting class. Anyway, it's raining like a crazy bitch and since it's the first day of class, there was no parking. Wonderful. I ended up parking waaaay the fuck out there, hiked my ass through the pouring rain to the gym..only to discover the class was on tue/thur (that be today) at 9:30. Fuck fuck fuck. I've done this like a half dozen times the past couple years. What the fuck's wrong with me? Geezus. Yea so I had to run back to my car, drive back, and blog this bitch.       Oh and funny thing, as I was pulling out of my neighborhood, who do I see driving behind me like an old granny? My good ol' buddy Stewart. I haven't talked to him in a longass time..think he's still pissed about me not wanting to drive his ass across town like a fucking chauffeur? Yea me too.  Oh well.
