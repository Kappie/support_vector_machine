While you washed out teenie-boppers don't admit it, you have to know (somewhere in your brainwashed brains) that Britney Spears and artists like her SUCK. How do you tell? (and by you I mean I, cause you can't tell, cause you buy her crappy one good-bad song albums) Anytime you have to resort to kissing Madonna, marrying a guy with two black children, marrying a guy for 24 hours, and having a "beef" with another fake artist (avril lavigne) your time as a credible artist is up. Whatever happened to good music? Why don't "artists" really sing instead of lip-syncing to songs that they didn't write. Screw them and their million dollar mansions. And screw people who bought that shit. I mean really, why would anybody buy a Britney CD that has one good song (and that song isn't good, it's just either catchy or overplayed until it gets stuck in your head)? I don't know, it all sucks.
