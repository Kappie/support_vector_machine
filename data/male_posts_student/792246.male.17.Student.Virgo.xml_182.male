    
       This might be the greatest day of my life.  I'm on Winter Break. I'm done with high school. I got to see Lizzy and Tristan after school. Claudia comes home tonight. Elizabeth got into MIT.  And I'm determined to make sure it doesn't end there.  I wish everyone happy respective holidays, which pretty much means:  Shiranne, Gabe, Naomi, and all you other Yodaya-jin, Happy Hannukah!  Everyone else, have a very merry Christmas.  Unless you're Ingy, who probably celebrates Kwanzaa.
