At least the two talk to one another...so it can't be that bad. But whom shall I call spoonface now? =(. Jokes jokes Rebecky =P. Oh well...she'll be back in a bit anyways hahaha...  Even though service started at 11am today, I still ahd to get up at 830, as our Bible Study class was at 915 instead. So got up, usual morning stuff, then went to grab Lina and Jason and off to church then.  Getting there, we were some of the first people there. So we kinda lounged around for a bit, dad made some garlic toast, so munched on some of that, and then eventually the others showed up. Carmen actually came somewhat early for once, and then after some chatting and stuff, we started our Bible Study on Daniel 4.  This chapter was the one where Nebuchadnezzar turns crazy, but then eventually goes back to a sane king, and he finally realizes how it is God that rules everything, and not him. Earlier, the reason why he was stripped away of everything was because he took credit for everything, but now he realizes that God runs this world. Well after an hour, we then finished the study, and then had some refreshments before heading upstairs for the joint service today.  Service was actually one of the best joint services I've been to. Pastor Mackness' message I thought was awesome. He spoke from Numbers Chapter 21 today, which tells of how ignorant the Israelites were while in the desert. Even after God had provided for them basically everything (food, water, protection, etc.) they STILL don't get the point that there is a God. So in the story, it speaks of how God then sent serpents to punish the Israelites for their ignorance. However, since God is merciful, he then told Moses to make a staff with a bronze snake wrapped around it *the current WHO symbol if I'm not wrong* and those who look to it will be saved.  I found this interesting, as when Pastor Mackness related it back to us, he did it very well. In that time, they had the  bronze snake on a staff. In our current time, we have Jesus Christ to look to in times of trouble. All you have to do is look up. Another reason why I liked today's sermon was because of how Pastor Mackness presented it. I don't mean to offend him or anything, but sometimes his sermons in english service are somewhat bland. However, even though I slept a wee bit today by accident *thanks Carmen for waking me up* I was about to fall asleep again, but for some reason the way Pastor D spoke today, it was so powerful. The expression, the power, the determined force that seemed to be driving him forth, probably one of the most exciting sermons I've heard from him in a while. So yeah after Carmen poked me awake, and after my temptation to sleep more, well that temptation sorta ended, I listened attentively to the remaining 30 minutes or so of the sermon. I actually remember this one very well, and I think I will for a while...  Communion then came along. I now know how my parents felt when I acted like a jackass up in service. I never really realized it until today when some people sitting beside me couldn't shut up for the whole time. I don't blame one of them as I had already explained, but the other person should have absolutely no excuse. I just hope that next time she'll be able to smarten up a little bit. Oh well, still managed to get through it, just kind of annoying with some voices beside me murmuring through the meditation time.  Afterwards, we headed downstairs, talked for a bit, and in the end I got Jason and Calvin over to my place. Jason, Gavin and I decided to have imitation martial arts battles, with Jason and Gavin never actually hitting one another just shifting up and down, and me chasing Jason around with one foot kicking the whole time and hobbling on the other. Effective way of fighting =P....  Afterwards for the afternoon basically just DDR'd and NFL Street for the time. Then they all left and I had a BBQ for dad's B-day, which is actually on the 7th but he's workin' then.  Anyways....I can't think of much else to blog about. Jason branded my house as being "boring" pretty much in his blog, if you want to see that. OH I REMEMBER NOW....  HOW THE HECK DID GREECE WIN EUROCUP!?  Now I'm normally not a soccer fan, but I still sure as hell know that Greece isn't exactly a top dog team. TOTAL underdog if you ask me, I mean portugal is underdog enough. EuroCup turned out REALLY strange, totally upside down from what I was expecting. Marcello and many other people cheering for Portugal are probably wide-eyed right now at the defeat that Portugal had received today. I for one don't really care, but I was rootin' for Portugal today if anyone. Things change since 2002 huh =P.  So yeah I'm going to go now, kinda bored, so yeah probably sleeping early for once tonight.  Those are my thoughts and rants for today.  Later.
