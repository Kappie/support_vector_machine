I guess she's not that bad, I mean I guess I complained too much about her the other day. For crying out loud our homework is to bring in lyrics to our favorite song, how fun and easy. Band was fun, sitting in the chorus room and seeing if Kate G would go out with Anthony L (Frank Sinatra) but it didn't work. He thought he had her, haha. Anyways, Paul was being the typical horny deushbag and he told Kate he'd give her a dollar if she could get me a boner. So, Kate and I kinda ignored him considering we're practically best friends, I mean we are best friends. So yea she kinda just tapped that shit but not enough to bonerize me, perhaps semi boner...what am I talking about? Oh yea I forgot to mention that my parents bedroom, stairs, upstairs hallway and the attic are being redone and some dude fell through my attic and into my room, I wish I saw it. I was told his legs were dangling out of the hole so he didn't fall all the way through. My mom said my uncle did that once and needed help to get out, haha that makes me giggle. Yea so my parents room is all weird and tall, the ceiling is high up and slanted, it's weird. They're almost done with my parents room, then they gotta do everything else. Ah and drum lessons today. We spent time doing reading and playing on the pad. He gave me this crazy exercise that seems easy. It's called "Two to Fifty." It's for wrist development and concentration. Just play full quarter notes 2 measures left hand and then 2 measure right hand, then 4 and 4, then 6 and 6, then 8 and 8, then 10 and 10...all the way to 50 and 50 and the whole exercise takes about 40-50 minutes and if you mess up, back to the beginning. Trust me it seems easy but the counting is hard to stick with for all that time. Ok, that's all. Bye.
