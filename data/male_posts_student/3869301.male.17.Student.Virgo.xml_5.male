Back when I went to church I went to a Catholic church (the only organized Christian religion I can stand, probalby because it is like a fast food chain:  uniform everywhere) I had church school on Wed. nights. Because my church was on the other side of the lake in Heber Springs and no one from my school was Catholic I knew no one at church outside of chuch. There was this girl though, Mandy, she was from Heber and she was in my class. I had the hugest crush on her. She was kind of a stick with brown hair and glasses. I stopped going to classes at some point. I don't know exactly why... I soon forgot about her, untill this year. The 2nd dumbest guy in my AP English class and the biggest asshole I know tells the class that he has a new girlfriend. Who other than Mandy... Through my few experiances with her of recent I have found her to quite different than I left her. She is now drinks alot and has a less than piete chassie. The following are selected pieces of conversation we had yesterday...  INT CHILLI'S, EXTERIOR  Mandy:  (she has a black shirt on with a wide slit down the middle so you can see her chest while her bra holds her breasts out of sight) Blake, can you see my bra? Blake:  (not looking and flatly) No. Mandy:  (turned around and half bending over) Blake is my but sweaty? Blake:  (not looking) No. Mandy:  You didn't look! Blake:  (not looking) John did. Mandy: (turned around and totally bending over and backing toward me) John, is my but sweaty? end scene  INT CHILLI'S, INTERIOR  We are all sitting at a long half-booth, half-table. The door opens and I look around and see a large girl that is not happy and is definately not pretty in the face.  Mandy:  I think that girl is good looking don't you guys? Amanda:  She's kind of pretty. Me:  Meh. Mandy:  Do you not think she is pretty, John? Is it because she is a large girl? Me:  No, I didn't like her because of her face. Mandy:  Because she had the same body type as I do. You don't want some stick girl. You gotta have some cushin for the pushin'. Me:  I am all for your body type I just didn't think she was good looking. Mandy:  You think I ugly, don't you? end convo  Same place. We are across from eachother mind you. Mandy turns to her right a bit too fast and she almost comes out of her top. She is apropriately embarassed.  Me: (turning my head so she can't she I am laughing) Blake:  You've embarassed John now. First the sweaty butt thing now this. Mandy:  John's not embarassed. Are you John? Me:  Not at all. I don't get embarassed most of the time. I was just laughing. Mandy:  See I could do this (she grabs her CC range breasts and moves them up and down a few times) and he wouldn't be embarassed. Me: tehe  Maybe if her and Blake ever break up I can hook up with her. She might be fun in the sack after a little booze.
