But just beyond the reach of the firelight, in the dark shadows of the corner sits the silent man that neither acknowledges.  One sees the man as an ally, the other as a threat.  He sits silently, listening to both positions as if scouting his opposition.  When he does speak both men listen intently.  But he remains in the shadows, even when both acknowledge his presence in either a welcoming or hostile tone.  Such is the life of Ralph Nader.  His stature has significantly decreased since 2000, but neither party is either willing or able to see it.  The 2000 election was his shining moment.  But the man failed in his goals and made enemies along the way.  It is for this reason that he will do poorly in 2004.  So why is he seen as the potential spoiler?  The high expectations for Nader is boggling to the mind.  No third party candidate has ever done as well the second time around.  Few major third party candidates have ever run twice.  Perot was an exception, as is Nader.  But look at Perot as an example.  In 1992 he received nineteen per cent of the popular vote, arguably costing Bush 41 the election.  Then in 1996, with much the same concern on the Republican side as the Democrats are showing towards Nader this year, Perot comes in with only nine per cent of the popular vote and having no affect on an election in which Clinton was reelected in a landslide.  So why don't the Democrats feel that Nader will experience the same drop as Perot?  The more interesting question is why do the Republicans feel Nader will be just as "popular" as he was in 2000?  The mind boggle.  They are expecting way too much, and they will discover their error the hard way.  This has been an issue I've thought about for some time, but its been a while since I really gave it much thought.  It wasn't until yesterday that I began thinking about Nader and his candidacy again.  It started with a call from the incoming chairman of the University of Oregon College Republicans.  Apparently Nader is holding a signature gathering party next Saturday to collect enough signatures to get on the Oregon ballot, something at which he failed only a few months earlier.  Turns out the chairman was informing the various CR members in an attempt to get as many of us to attend the party as possible.  The idea is to help Nader get on the ballot so he can potentially hurt Kerry.  Needless to say I think its worthless to do such a thing since Nader won't have an impact on the election.  But apparently the Republican party doesn't believe so and is backing the operation from what I could gather.  The chairman told me not to mention to anyone that the Republicans are involved, so I can only assume they are organizing it or encouraging their members to help Nader in his effort (not sure whether its the state party or the national that's involved).  I find it a bit shady and sleazy.  One should work for the candidate they support and for no one else.  They should help their candidate win votes.  If a candidate can't win an election on his own and is dependent, no matter how small, on another candidate's potential to syphon votes away from the competition then maybe the candidate doesn't deserve to win.  Maybe the candidate doesn't deserve my vote.  I refuse to take part in such misadventures.  The Republicans are overestimating Nader's influence.  I'm also convinced that their actions will end up hurting them in the end.  But more than that, it will do them no good.  Nader will not be a factor.  Their efforts, which could have been applied towards furthering President Bush's reelection, will have gone to waste.  These efforts may end up hurting the campaign in the most drastic way possible, which would be the defeat of the President.  But I can hardly say I care.
