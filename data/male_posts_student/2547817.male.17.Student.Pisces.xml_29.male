It was difficult to make out in the thick uneasiness. Blurred, diminished, fuzzed, faded, like a disrupted signal from a live broadcast. We queued my register number and I prayed whilst Shi Hui took her 11. I sat down and looked as Mrs Chew dismally. 13, and I deliberately asked her to repeat herself twice. The twins, and a couple of others were there. Hugs and congratulations all around. I was pleased. I thanked my teachers and they thanked me.   It hit me later that Leon got 11 and I got thirteen. I'm not sure what to call it. Jealousy? Envy? What? I know it shouldn't be there. It's just that we did so much work together and well, how did that happen? Ironic huh? So much for resolving to stick with thy will be done. I spoke to Des and Zel about it. They both seem to think that it's perfectly normal to feel this way. Bro, I know you'll be reading this soon. Hold it not against me. It's just that you're my bar for a lot of things and you just keep getting better and better.  Look lah, Who's better at Academics Sports Music Public Relations Religion Morals and Values Relationships.  Shit lah. I'm not overjoyed with thirteen, I'm just happy. After all, I was hoping for 15. To God be the glory. Well God, here's another problem for you to help me fix.
