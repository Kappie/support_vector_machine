Yes...i usually eat a lot...but unfortunately, e stupid throat inflamation makes my throat ahurt a lot when ever i swallow anything. Aw..poor me. I just rested and did maths fer almost e whole day and downloaded a few new band pieces. On the contrary...i'm realli worried about tmw's band performance for the sch's national day celebration. The doc adviced me not to blow my instrument cauz it'd just make my throat's condition worse. But after some thought...to hell with wat the doc said. Band comes first...nt to to mention its my last performance already. A friend of mine apparently got grounded for the 4 days holiday. I realli cant imagine how she'd last through it...ooosh. I actually wanted her to come along with some frenz to catch a movie or smth...but oh well...things never exactly turn out the way they should be. On the other hand...i still cant seem to get over wadever happened between me and my ex gf. Maybe i should just cut all contacts with her lyk...forever. We don't talk or anything anymore, and she didnt even say anything about my concert...not even a normal "gd luck" or anything. But its hard not to think about her, its lyk...argh. wadever. I realli gotta recover soon, cauz i hate my mum to be so worried over this. Oh boy. Things just get more and more complicated. Love is a complicated thing mann..never should have gotten involved.
