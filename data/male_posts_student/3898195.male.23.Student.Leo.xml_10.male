The chair was $130 and the table was $54.  As any geeks would say, you can't skim out on chair. Chair is one of the most important stuff to a geek. A good chair provides baby-like comfort and a bad chair would cause you more than pain and suffering. Sitting on a chair for several hours at a time is a very intensive task, don't think so? Think this, imaging yourself on a chair with a decent pad and one without it, try both for few hours and tell me if the pad isn't any important. I speak from experience... so next time you getting a chair make sure it's a good one and not one of those cheap Wal-Mart specials on display.
