So I saw Miss Hershey  standing behind the Powerhouse on the corner of Clark and Fifth Avenue, and I whipped out  my Whopper and whispered, "Hey Sweetart, how'd you like to Krunch on my Big Hunk for a  Hundred Thousand Dollar Bar?" Well, she immediately went down on my Tootsie Roll, and,  Uno, it was like pure Almond Joy. I couldn't help but grab her delicious Mounds 'cause it  was easy to see that this little Twix had the Red Hots. It was all I could do to hold back  a Snicker and a Krackle as my Butterfinger went up her tight little Kit Kat and she started  to scream "Oh Henry, Oh Henry!" Soon she was fondling my Peter Paul and Zagnuts and I knew  it wouldn't be long before I blew my Milkduds clear to Mars and gave her a taste of the old  Milky Way. She asked if I was to M, but I said "Hey Chicklet, no kinky stuff". I said  "Look you little Reeces Pieces, don't be a Zero, be a Lifesaver. Why don't you just take  my Whatchamacallit and slip it up your Bit O'Honey?" (and what a piece of Juicyfruit she  was too). She screamed, "Oh, Crackerjack, you're better than the Three Musketeers!" as I  rammed my Ding Dong up her Rocky Road and into her Peanut Butter Cup. Well, I was givin'  it to her Good 'n' Plenty, when all of a sudden... my Starburst. As luck would have it,  she started to grow a bit Chunky and complained of a Wrigley in her stomach. Sure enough,  nine months later, out popped a Baby Ruth.
