And today, all I have to do is study math a little and then do some scenteces for math which I shall do tomorrow. Other then that, I am having a good week.  Most of my classes though, are really good to students for we will hardly ever have homework so to speak. Like US History, Coach Web says we will never have homework for the most part because we will always do the work in class. In discrete math, the math is so easy you could finish the work in class.  So the only two classes I really have to worry about this sememster, is Physics and Language Arts. Pretty cool, huh?  Anyway, today has been a wierd day too. At lunch, I went to go sit down with my friends for lunch like every other day. And this girl out of no were comes, sits down, and starts talking to us out of the blue. Her friends behind her were laughing themselfs to death, so you could tell that it was a dare for some reason. Anyway, other then that, the day has been rather normal.  Well, got to run. I guess I should start studing some math. But I will do those scentences tomorrow during study hall. They should only take about 10 mins to do. Well, later!    Wolfwood
