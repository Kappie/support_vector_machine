It was worth my time as I finally decided on wad course I would like to go to. Tt course is Aerospace Technology. I felt tt it was veri interesting and different frm the rest of the courses, tt's why I realli wanna get into it. After tt, I headed straight home without hafing my lunch as I couldn't find some1 to chill wif. I did some research on certain stuff at home b4 going out. I went gambling frm 3pm all the way to 8pm. Imanaged to earn much more money than usual, about twice as much frm the previous times. Well, I'm gonna save up tt money first as I needa buy some stuff. My piggy bank has like $200 in it rite now. I managed to save like $50/wk, which I feel is totally great. L0L!    On Sun, I had tuition frm 12:00pm all the way to 1:30pm. I did my E Maths homework after tt b4I redidmy FN introduction for task B. After Ihadcompleted all of tt, I chilled for the rest of the day. I didnt wanna go out as I didnt wanna spend the money tt I had juz earned. I figured out tt I wasn't gonna waste the money and tt I shld save up instead as I needa to buy some other stuff. L0L!    Today was pretty tiring. Nothing much happened though. After sch, I had my practical for the FN task B. Fat pussy cat and lil' pig asked me out for lunch, but I chose not to go due to certain issues. The prac was realli long, it was much of a disaster, but I still managed to pull it off somehow. After the prac, I went to Clementi Interchange wif the fat pussy cat and lil' pig as piggy wanted to eat. In the end, we went to 7-11 to grab some stuff. I felt tt fat pussy cat was kindda hostile and cold towards after tt prac. I haf no idea why, he juz didn't wanna talk to me and stuff, so I juz kept quiet and kept a distance away frm him. I figured out tt was the onli solution to the problem. I took a cab frm Clementi Interchange wif lil' pig to his house first b4 proceeding to mine. He told me some rather interesting and amusing stuff in the cab tt made me start thinkin. L0L!    When I got home, I took a shower, ate my dinner and watched the television. Mortal Kombat was on and I wasn't gonna miss it. Luckily, there isn't any homework tt I hafta hand in tmr. I completed my work during the wkends and there isn't much homework today too. Well, I guess I'll stop here for now. Cya soon~! =]
