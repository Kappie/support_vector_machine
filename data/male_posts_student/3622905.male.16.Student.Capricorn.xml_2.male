MUAHAHAHAHA .. *cough  cough hack wheeze*.. scuse me.. heh.. ^^ ]       unfortunately.. the only solution that i can think of now is to get off  my lazy butt and start studying like mad.. after all the A lvls are  like .. hmm.. lets see.. a yr and a half to go?!! if there was a better  time to start.. it is definitely now.. now all i have to do is to  figure out how in the blue hell am i supposed to kick my "studying  program" into gear.. my habits are definitely gonna put up a gd fight  b4 i surrender to the mindless but essential act of studying/mugging..       >sidethought     [ the thought of studying really puts me off now.. i mean.. its like the  middle of the year and everyone is expected to study like mad already..  still.. this holds alot of truth.. lectures and tutorials have already  covered about or more than half of the syllabus so that means that we  have  ALOT  to cover if you are one of those last minute muggers.. sorta  like me.. cept my last minute is more like a few days b4..  ]       fortunately.. i havent lost to the dark side yet.. my sanity and  happiness is still very much intact.. alive and kicking.. havent fallen  to the dark side yet.. partly cos i try my best to think of good happy  stuff!! memories that bring me joy and happiness.. memories that can  last for life.. coupled with a computer.. a funny comics and a sense of  humour.. in other words.. try your best to look on the bright side of  life.. stay happy!!       >sidethought     [ realli.. happiness is  essential .. if u dun know this alreadi.. which i think u  should already have.. happiness= satisfying life.. together with  laughter.. friends and good food.. u should pretty much be contented in  avery aspect of your social life.. my opinion at least.. oh well.. ^^ ]       heres a few comics from pvponline.com thats kinda funny.. strikes me as  realli comical.. anyhoot.. it gave me a gd laugh.. hope it gives u one  too!    urlLink      Introducing: Scratch Fury - Destroyer of Worlds and the troll Skull..    urlLink      First Order of Business: Spray Cat With Water    urlLink      What Comes Out of an Evil Super Smart Cat: Hairball    urlLink      The Ultimate Distraction: Ball of String    urlLink      Baseball Bat = The Ultimate Spam Filter!    as u prolly knoe by now.. im a BIG fan of scott kurtz and his work.. formore go 2 pvponline.com..
