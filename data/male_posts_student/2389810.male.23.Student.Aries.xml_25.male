This piece began with a lot of emotion, mostly reflective of my fight with my cable company (and I kind of lost motion once the anger subsided, also it was hard to work on w/o access to the Internet and imagery).  Don't really have much to say about it, everything is in there as text.  I did do most of it intentionally (i.e. the unfinished black space on the bottom left, the darkness, the faceless guard, etc).  No real other comments though, on to Arzhang.   Had to link it from my site, as I'm still w/o Internet and don't have access to  urlLink Hello .  The full-size image is big (1.42MB), just as a warning.
