Another guppy is doing his damndest to finish every drop of JD out there.  Another prediction fulfilled.  Senor Jurado though is embracing his roots and not working as previously expected.  A nice twist I must say.  Just remember, when American dollars run out, businesses will not accept pesos or centavos or any other forms of payment.  Sorry sir, "favors" will not get you 2 chalupas and a soda at Taco Bell.  Keep it up men!
