"all tt talk all 4 show, no real substance." i wld haf gotten up and knocked e daylights outta him if i didn't feel e same way. i admit, sumtimes i tend 2 b a bit outspoken maybe obnoxious and cocky 2 sum, whole dae talking bout competitions and stuff when my own fitness is in tatters. am i realli gonna run e army half marathon? am i really gonna run e full standard chartered marathon? am i realli gonna aim 4 a medal 4 real run? how can i win anithing when i cldn't even do lvl-1? lvl 2 oso might not haf any chance 2 win. am i aiming 2 high? esp 4 sum1 who crawls outta bed every morning, crying as i take painkillers, weighing my options; whether addiction is worth a chance 2 stand again? sum1 whose legs can barely support his own body weight?      jus wanna sae a few words 2 sum ppl:   star player: injured ankle, sprained wrists etc and still trg? crazy shit! jus know when 2 rest. dun need 2 listen 2 me but jus rmb, u dun wanna end up in my state.   li yun: another crazy one, injured still push like siao, eg 2dae's trg? but at least more sensible den mr star. rite?   julia: 2dae whack until like crazy den went 2 puke or smth rite? but very impressed 2 see u running everydae. keep up e gd work, a captain needs respect, and u haf gained mine together wif many others.   joanne and zhiying: saw u struggling in pain e last few trgs. shld stop and rest if u feel pain. can alwaes make up other time. pain is ur body's way of telling u smth is wrong, so dun ignore.   henyi: my gd fren, u oso another one injured. but at least u noe how 2 rest. but i want u think more abt wad i told u e other time, k?   galvin and hui xin: i'll stop trg, i promised liao. after real run. i noe u r concerned and i appreciate tt, realli. but this run is very impt 2 me, i'm almost done.   prashan: i'm not worthy 2 be called e future of cj x-country. sry.   sl: i promised u a medal this sundae. i will try my best.
