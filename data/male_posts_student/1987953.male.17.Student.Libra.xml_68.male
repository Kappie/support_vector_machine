Anyway, I have some news that is both good and bad: Brittany and I are no longer on speaking terms. Without going into painful details and trying to sit there and dish out blame, we were both at fault and hurt each other way too much, and now we can't do anything but argue. Those of you who know either of us know the situation and you know who is at blame for what.   Very good news: my buddy Greg from school got me to get a  urlLink Deviant Art  page. I know you're asking now, "What is a Deviant Art page?" Well, the answer is simple. Deviant Art is a page similar to a blog page where you post anything artistic that you, yourself, have created. I have posted only one piece of art so far, and it is a sonnet I wrote in English class that is pretty good I guess. As I go along, I will post more of the stuff I have written. Anyway, the link to my Deviant Art page is:  urlLink http://ripkenfan86.deviantart.com . It will also be on the frame on the right very soon.   Anyway, blog ya later with more! God bless!
