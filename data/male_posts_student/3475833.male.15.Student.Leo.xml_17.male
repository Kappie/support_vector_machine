I really am not as smart as I thought, there are a lot of things I don't know, but I guess I'm not the only one who doesn't know these things. Am I'm glad I have a girlfriend who can teach me all the things I missed out on in my sheltered childhood. She's truly the best person I know, I would do anything for her, and I can say that with full confidence. I really truly do love Alyssa, I love her with all my heart for ever and for always.  I really hate waiting too. It bothers me so much, but it doesn't matter, because everything is all right. Yup yup. I really like hanging out with Alyssa too. Some fun times. Ix-nay on line two, ix-nay on line two.   An Ice Covered Edge.   Why do I sit here in this suburb of boredom? Beaten and bruised, used and abused. The restrictions of age always bringing me down, Holding me here in this god-forsaken town. I want to get out and leave this place, Move away with a new game face. Yet, I want to stay here and I don't want to forget, But dwelling on memories will only get me what I get.  With so much crap going on, I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on. With the worries of love, and the worries of hate, And a few little worries about the eternal gate.  With so many emotions flying around, And my net crushed and powdered into the ground, It's so hard to catch just one thing to tackle, But I've got someone to help me through. Someone whom I love with every body part, From my head to my toes to my heart.  Never giving up on what can stay true, To her: I'll never give up on you. I love you no matter what the outcome, And it my make my heart expand some.  Hate the action, not the sinner: A word of advice said over dinner, Could never be more true. It's time to get up and think about life, Think about the path I want to take, And stop and think about the decisions I make. Think about how they could affect me in later years, And will those effects bring me down in tears.  I want everything to be all right, And that why we had that talk. Fifteen isn't even half my life, It's not even a quarter of the walk.  Remember your promise and keep it true, No matter what it could do. Though I've promised to you and messed it up, Don't give up on me yet. I'm sorry I've screwed up in so many ways, Had so many wasted days. I still love you, And it'll always stay true, I wish there was something that I could do.  I feel so bad for my mistakes, And I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Isn't there another guy you'd rather be with? Or are you going to sit there and plead the fifth? I'm sure I'm not the best you can do, And I feel I've let you down so much. I'm having so much trouble taking care of you, My mind just turns to mush.  I'm sorry, is all I have to say, And I feel like I'm saying goodbye today. I don't know why and I don't know when, But I fear an inevitable end.  Drifting away and drifting apart? You hold all the pieces of my heart. IT'S NOT GOODBYE, IT'S NOT THE END. Forgive me for I have sinned. I'm having trouble holding on, My hands tremble,  And my feet scoot closer to the edge. Hold me and help me fix it all, Help me round the edges of the misshapen ball.
