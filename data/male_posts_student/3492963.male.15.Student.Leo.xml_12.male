I woke up at noon(because I went to bed at 4) I did my daily chores of taking out the trash, doing dishes, and laundry. I sat around all day, mostly at the computer. I did go outside to take a broken comp monitor to the trash, but I decided to go out in the alley at hurl it up in the air and throw it on the ground, via its power cords. it's in a million pieces waiting to be picked up by the garbage men(it's in a bag.) Then 7 came around and I went bowling with my youth group at the local bowling alley. I bowled a 124 :( and then a 195 :). I got tired of bowling so I went to play pool and won all 3 times. I paid for my games..blah..blah. I played the grabby-clawy thingy and one a tye-dye stuffed teddy bear. It's disgusting, too cute. Then I came home, watched ER and South Park. I just got out of the shower like 10 minutes ago (1:49AM) and now I'm typing this (1:49AM.) HEHE...I'm so retarded.
