So what of this information didn't you already know? The only thing my mom would learn from reading my blog is that I'm not the teenager she was grounding every week.      Here are some things my mom has found by snooping or walking in on me:    In middle school she found a bottle of jack daniels in my backpack. At 16 She took my car away for a month after my sister told her I'd driven home drunk from a football party.  She found a roach in my desk drawer and ecstasy in my wallet. That same year she found Don's crackpipe and a freshly rolled blunt in my room. She also found steroids, acid, and shrooms a few times.  She walked in on a 3 some. From the age of 15 until I moved out at 18 she walked in on me having sex in my room, her room, the den, bathroom, garage, in my car parked in the garage, the kitchen, backyard and on the stairs. She's walked in on drunk sex, sex on drugs, video taped sex, sex with toys, sex with more then one girl in a week. She's walked in on it all including me pleasuring myself numerous times. I had a lock on my door but she had a key.  We are on good terms now that I am old enough to know better. To thank her for putting up with me I will buy her a mercedes someday.
