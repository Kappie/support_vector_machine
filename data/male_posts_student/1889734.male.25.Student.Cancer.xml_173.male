The evil Bush Tax Cuts expanded a break that allows luxury SUVs to be taxed at lower rates.  The Times goes insane.  It seems that they don't like it when the auto industry receives a boon, since this makes the big ticket high-profit SUV sell better.  No, the Times is jsut angry at the affluence of the SUV buyer.  They refer to 'chrome-plated' affluence, 'ultraluxury', and my favorite - 'highway hubris'.  So if you drive an SUV, you are engaging in 'overbearing pride and arrogance' according to the definition on Dictionary.com.  The Times just hates it when people spend money on thier own initiative.  I guess we should let the Times select our vehicles for us.
