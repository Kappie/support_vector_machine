I think the genesis of all my comments is a lingering (and active) bitterness I have about my so-called life; it just seems like in so many ways all I meet is frustration.  And the source of the frustration seems to be an inability to actually go and do what I want to do - I'm always too concerned with what other people think and pleasing them.  But the opposite is true, too - I'm very susceptible to joining something wholeheartedly if I'm given encouragement.  So in many ways I feel like I'm upset that I'm being discouraged to do things that I think are worthwhile and principled (by people who claim to have the same values as myself), while not being encouraged to do things that I know I ought to be doing and just don't seem to be able to do on my own.  There just doesn't seem to be that unconditional support from any source.  But I was thinking about it this morning, and I think that I'm going to start having a more careless attitude (somewhat like I used to have).  Maybe sometimes it's ok to have people angry or disillusioned with you, to strike out on your own and cut some ties.  Maybe it's even ok to take on an entire society.  Of course, the part that's going to hurt is that the people I feel I'm going to most alienate are those closest to me, the ones who SHOULD be supporting me, and I just don't know what other support group I'm going to be able to come up with.  Anyway...I realize that all of this is relatively pie-in-the-sky right now until I start making some actual changes, but I still don't know what changes I'm going to make.  But I know I can't stay the way I am...
