Anyway, was really tired and drained, so not the usual self that i am today! I guess, it was quite obvious to alot of my friends who questioned me and asked why i was so dead today... haha... The answer? Cause, i was drained lah! Literally drained! with 450ml of blood missing from me, what do you think? haha... anyway, i am missing my 1st math tuition today thanks to the fatigue and drained feeling that i feel right now... really feel like crap! but oh well, at least, i get to relax and rest right now...  heex... anyway, i saw, Kelly today and i feel really happy! Yup, i don't know... it's like, this feeling of joy and just... simply, happiness just overwhelmed me! You know, i never did realise how much i missed her till today? man... it's like, never see her much around school after all, and she didn't turn up for CO, so... yeah... anyway, heard that she injured her finger, sure hope that she gets well soon, so... i am going to pray for her lah... really hope that it'll heal... Anyway, Mega Concert is coming up soon and i am sure that during that period of time, i'll be able to see her more soon! haha... OH! her birthday is coming up on the 22nd! ARGH! i haven't gotten anything for her yet! Grr... don't know what to get her, cause, i've got so many ideas! oh man... but... does anyone have any suggestions? please tell me yeah?  okok... anyway, i've been talking to the mysterious girl for a few nights, and... haha... looks like she owes me something now! haha... She owes me a picture! haha... one that includes her in a dress! haha... i know it sounds weird and people would wonder why i would be so happy and amused about it... basically, it's cause, NOONE! and i mean... absolutely NOONE has ever seen her in a dress before, of course excluding the time when she was young and like an infant lah! haha... but nothing else lah... what she read already, come and kill me... haha... but yeah, really happy about quite a lot of things now lah...  OH! i am doing the sharing thing tomorrow for Sunday school, and i am a little nervous... oh well... please pray for me and not let me screw up please... pretty pretty please! haha... ok... got to go liao, getting quite dizzy again... :p Smile! :p
