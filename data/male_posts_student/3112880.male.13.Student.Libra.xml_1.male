(until 1010)       Then it was followed by stupid kolam designing. You know those Indian decoration thingies that you see on the floor... >_>     Firstly, because it was all messy and we had no experience whatsoever.     Secondly, we ran out of materials.     Thirdly, the design was all screwed.     Fourthly, no one in our class was good in art let alone being in aep.   Fifthly, the whole thing was just a failure.    Our class's kolam was the worst compared to the rest of the classes. Totally embarrasing. Mrs Jay said that we should owe it to our bad organisation and planning... Whatever.    The teacher's ethnic costumes were just as spastic. It was like Mr Tan won the prize for best dressed male teacher. HE is like... g*y? c***y? He wore his peranakan costume...    Mr Koh wore this tight white shirt, and a very very short sarong with slippers. Looked kind of akward and revealing. They were talking about how he brushed against the table and revealed something. eek.    Mrs Jay wore her usual ethnic clothes. So did mrs ng. yah. the rest of the teachers wore other clothes too. not worth mentioning.    The presentation afterwards was very boring... ended school at 1.25 today. We had to clear up the stupid kolams. Only Jeremy and I cleared up. The rest slacked. Isaac came to help sweep a bit and take out the masking tape.     As we were leaving, that id**tic mr lai called us back "leon!!... lester!...." apparently he could not tell who was who. lester wasnt even in school! Laisy was like crying out frantically (think somebody save me.... ) to us, to help him remove the tape. >:    screw da huren.    took 76. isaac and i were waiting for the bus when HL came with his gay friend. We all boarded that double decked bus.   The 4 of us talked along the way... mostly crap too. especially HL, his gay friend and crushes.   Marcus boarded the bus too with some of his friends at vj.     I called jonathan. He had smsed me telling me to call him when school finished. He was very sick and had a cold. so i called him, we talked abit. Mostly about the stupid kolam. He claims that if he was in school, it would not have been such a failure, and that without him, 2k is useless. WHAT RUBBISH.    Haiz... Tomorrow i'm presenting my crp project. lit sucks...
