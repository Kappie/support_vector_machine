Which is irrisponsible and pretty nuts but thos of you that know me know that I am irrisponsible and a little nuts.  I'm not going to try to recount what has happened in the last two months but I will start from where I am now.  I'm going to try to go back to updating this every few days like I used to. So here it goes...  This week a lot of big things happened to me.  First of all I bought a car, a '99 4 door blazer.  This is a big deal because I have never owned any car newer than 10 years old.  It's a good truck and I love it.  The only thing is that now I have a car payment but I guess I have to get responsible at some time.  Also this weekend I went up to Omaha with Toms, Paul and Ryan Miller.  It got a little crazy but all I'm going to say about it was that it ended up with an ambulance, fire truck and 2 police officers showing up and me spending 5 hours in the emergency room.  So my advice to all of you is to not piss off Claudia unless you have a lot of time on your hands.  No hard feelings though..  But I have to go do some homework so that I can go to the wheel for my weekly meeting of the Alcoholic Enthusiest Support Group.  BUt I want to leave you with this thought, If I had my life to live over again I would live over a bar. Peace out Kids..
