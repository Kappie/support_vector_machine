I went to B lunch and there were no stupid sophmores cus I ran 'em all down! I had a fish basket! For only  $1.50 ! I sat with one  coolass colorguard ! She was cool! I went back to BCIS! She gave us a pop quiz! It was over the toolbar buttons in MS Word and also  the difference between a mouse and a keyboard ! It was easy (for me)! I finished in under a minute! Everyone hated me! I laughed my ass off all the way to my seat! The bell rang! I went to band! We played our show! No outside practice until Monday! Someone stole my coordinate sheet... But it's OKAY! I lied to Mr. Jones and told him I saw one of the janitors throw it away! He gave me another one! Bwahaha!  I'm getting duped into some  Gayliens Vs. Gaydator  tonight. That's so wrong. It'll probably be like  Freddy Vs. Gayson , and by that I mean the same director probably directed it. And by that I mean it's probably gonna suck. And by that I mean it looks gay. In fact, I can't choose which one looks gayer. Thus,  Gayliens Vs. Gaydator   VS.   Freddy Vs. Gayson .
