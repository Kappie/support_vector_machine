In the process, I got in a yelling match with my professor in class because he was wrong on quite a few answers, and refused to look at the answers I was presenting.  I didn't know that something with a pH of 7 is considered a basic solution.  Another student in the class walked out after another yelling match.  Very interesting day indeed.  Oh yeah, JL...smile!
