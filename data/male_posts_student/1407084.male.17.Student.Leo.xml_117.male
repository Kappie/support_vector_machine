Our school this year has the worst sportsmanship I have ever seen  Wow, I need a girlfriend. random, yes, but true. Maybe someday Ill get around to it  Hmm.. what else do I have to talk about.. I'm thinking about going post-secondary next year maybe  For some reason I have that sheryl crow song "The First Cut is the Deepest" stuck in my head.. I have been trying to figure out the significance of that, but I think maybe the song is just catchy and it was played on the radio too many times. oh well.  Well, looks like I'm gonna have to find myself something to do during snodaze, i mean, not like im unhappy that nobody has asked me or anything, i don't really feel that way.. there were a few people i wanted to go with, and some that i would go with if they asked me, and there we go i lost my train of thought, why do i keep talking about this stupid dance, i need to find something else to do that is less depressing  bye
