There was the dream that made me wonder if I had woke up earlier and made some phone calls and went to bed. There were also the pornographic ones and the ones where I overhear people talking about me. Then there was the really deep dream that I had in the middle of last week. A character in the dream, who was supposed to be a boss of mine, was crying that she wasn't real. Her words were "you don't know how it feels to know you're just a character in a dream." That was the most trippy!   Man... the notion of not being real and just being a character in a dream? It's nothing new, there are those Star Trek holodeck episodes, where the characters "wake up" to their situation. Or the episode of Growing Pains when Ben discovers he's a character in a TV show. Stuff like this really makes me tread the line between atheist and agnostic. The notion of something unifying the plots of our lives, but if that were true it takes away from our own power as individuals. I'm too hungry to continue dwelling on this. Time for breakfast / lunch.  ***
