It sucks, but pay is good, so ... yeah. ;)  Anyways, I've had alot of shit happen to me in past few days. Some good, some bad ...  The good news is that I'm now teaching the CNA class at my mother's school. I have to get up at 4:00AM, but still I really do enjoy teaching. There's always something that can be taugh between student and teacher. It's just a weird wacked thing that I've learned.  Some of the bad news, is that Maria can't work up at the school anymore. That sucks! I'm really not going into detail with that, but ... it just sucks big donkey dick!  Right now, I waiting for Maria to come home. She went with her mother to go out to eat and to see a movie. It's cool how she can still have mother and daughter time after what had happend. I still feel a little weird about her mother ... It's a long story ... I might explain later ...  Well, nice to chat with ya again ...
