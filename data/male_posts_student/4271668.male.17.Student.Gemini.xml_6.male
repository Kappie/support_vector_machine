Why is it that I can't see what is going good in my life when anything bad is going on.  Somtimes I wish that nothing ever changed, that everything would always be the same and we would have no pain or sorrow. But then I realise that we would have no excitement or happyness.  This Blog might not be all about the thoughts that apply to other people but more about me geting my thoughts out of my head and onto paper.  Yesterday when I broke up with my girlfriend I thought that it would be easier then to try to make a long distance relationship work.  I'm not so sure that this is true.  Even with the good news that my little brother, who I've missed so much for years, decided to move into my dad's house I couldn't stop thinking of my own plight with love.  I was the happiest I've ever been with her and I'm not so sure right now that I will ever be that happy again.  I wish that I wasn't so young so that I could go with her.  She wouldn't be happy with me not finishing highschool.  I would give up anything to see her just for another second.  I've decided I'm not going to follow my dream of military flying.  I've wanted to be a fighter pilot since I was five but I just want another chance with her more then that.  Well that's enough thinking for tonight I think I'm going to bed.  Goodnight.
