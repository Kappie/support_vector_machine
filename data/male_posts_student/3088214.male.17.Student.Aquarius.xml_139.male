I thought the multiple choice was on the easy side, answered all but four or five.  As for the essays, one will be good, the other two are a dice roll, there's no organization in so little time!!!  Anyway, the point is, one down, two to go...are we reviewing after school tomorrow?  Wanting to know if I should come.  Love, Rob
