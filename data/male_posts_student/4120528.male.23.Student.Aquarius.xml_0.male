One is where exactly I am going to be moving and what I am going to be doing while I am there. That and I will have to leave two good friends here one of which I care about. The other thing of work is about as fun as anything anymore. I go I work I leave its all good or to quote my friend misty "K Good". At least yesterday wasnt too bad. I was at my friend larry's house again to try and get the rest of the tree down. We got the two biggest sections down and it was scarry as shit being thirty feet in the air with a huge tree limbe that is about 25 feet long coming down at what looks like the neighbors house only to fall right in-between the two houses. I was sooooooo thankful for that one. Then when we limbed another one it was pulling my safety lines so that scared the crap out of me but when that was all done I had a really cool seat at about thirty feet a nice view of the valley and a good chance to watch the thunder clouds come roling in. Yea that wasnt fun. As soon as I heard a rumble I was like Yea IM done for today. I was on the ground in about 8 mins, usauall it took about 15. Once I was on the ground I was getting my stuff together and out in my car I walked over to see what else had to be done and not much else has to be done but while we where looking the big drops started to fall and we were like ok its time to go. All that night the biggest thing I wanted to do was take a shower but that didnt happen because it was thundering and lighting out and you are not suppose to do that because the lighting could come up through the water lines from the drainage. So I had to go out with out a shower and felt really gross. One a good night to that night I was able to talk to misty a little bit and that was good. I really enjoy talking to her. It seems wierd but it feels like all my other problems just fade away when I am talking to her but then again we talk about all our problems. So it is like mutual therapy. I just hope that I am helping her deal with her stuff as much as she is helping me with mine. I hope that things turn out good for her. She has had soo much bad stuff go on in her life that she deserves better. Well that is aboot all that is going on here. I will be going home for a few days. So I will probably posting again soon.
