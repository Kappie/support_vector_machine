You know, your Red Bulls, your AMPs, your Sobe Adrenalines...there's a million of them.  I've even learned there's a Nelly-sponsored drink called Pimp Juice.  Well, in the name of research I've kicked back 3 of these badboys tonight.  Just hoping they can keep me going til 5-6am; I'm in no mood for the 24-hour shit tonight.  Wow, my leg is totally shaking...I feel like Thumper.  Hmmm, maybe that's not a good analogy.  One of these energy drinks I gulped down was a Jolt Espresso.  On the label it says it's a coffee-cola blend.  It's kinda like coffee-flavored Coke if you can imagine it; similar to Vanilla Coke, I suppose.  For what it's worth, I won't be drinking it again.  I don't know WHAT the fuck was wrong with me today.  I walked two blocks to the ATM, back one block for the convenience store for this supercaffeine and then back to the apartment.  I haven't been outdoors since.  I'm jogging my ass to the Space Needle tomorrow.  Or maybe take the bus out there and jog back.
