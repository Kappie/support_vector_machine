It's like aerobics, except aerobics doesn't make you feel like a total dipshit. The pre dance "warm up" was boot camp! I'm aching like a monkey's uncle! I was so traumatized! I mean like, the rest have been doing this for some time now, but I've practically never danced in my life except for the PJ mass dance with pretty ice queen Siti with the pretty eyes. So the first time I actually do a dance class, I get thrown into a competition class. Sial lah. Thank goodness for Mrs C! She's so nice! ...and um Raj too... *snigger* *COUGH!* What really sucked is that it cost me like $22 coz it finished 2 hours late and I had to take a cab home ($10) and then a cab to City Hall ($12).  Went for the choir concert last night. It wasn't as good as I'd liked it to have been, BUT agnus dei was great, except for this one little bit where the tenors made a BIG boo boo... to me at least. I gasped and my friend turned and looked at me strangely. On the whole, I'd say, maybe 7.5? Oh well, they're capable of much better, coz from last night's performance, "the arts magazine" was wrong to have said that they're "arguably the best school choir in the land".  After the concert, Wei Xin showed up. I'd paid an extra 21 bucks, had an empty seat and an un-torn ticket in my pocket. At least Caleb Kay, younger by 2 years, had the decency to pay even though he couldn't go, coz he was grounded (which is a valid reason by me). So much for not having the money, time (coz he had to catch up with his studies) or hype (what the hell do I care if he'd broken up with Christina and she was going too?)(Yes Wei Xin, I'm a lit student, I can make inferences and draw parallels, and am trained to argue well and rationally without over excessive incorporation of emotion. Besides, it doesn't really take a rocket scientist). Well, now we know he's real responsible, placing his interests first. I've got plenty of shit lined up waiting to be fired at you man. What have you got other than a thesis statement with no elaboration? But NOOOO, he had better things to do. He went to spend time with his class which loves him dearly and had a twelve dollar dinner. Attempted to smart talk me. I shan't go to the extent of putting the SMS's up here. That's just a last resort if the matter is pursued. I nearly hit him, then decided to walk away. Asked the group to choose between one or two. One was to go back and beat him up, two was to cool it. They chose 1, not knowing what it was. I turned and walked briskly toward him, and they began to shout "TWO! TWO!"... HAHA! So anyway, he with all the class in the world, raised his index finger to my face. I pushed him about a bit. Arthur- that clown came to stop me before I could do anything else. Haiz. I'm glad Arthur was there. Not coz he stopped me from hurting Wei Xin, but coz he stopped me from hurting myself. Thanks man.  I'm not proud of what I did. It was not right. It was impulsive and immature. The situation could have been handled differently if I'd  thought of assuring him that payment need not have been rushed. I did not please the Lord coz I did not forgive him who trespassed against me. I apologized to him later. I think I wish I'd hit him, but then, I think I'm glad I didn't. I ought to apologize to God too. Hazel's going to have a field day with this. Her and her emotional blackmail. They're all alike lah. Why do I still love her? I will think about that and answer soon.  My lips fit the shape of the top of a glass bottle of coke coz I typed out the last paragraph with it "suctioned" to my lips. They taste funny now... haha. I shall do it again.  OK, as for today, I bought a guitar bad for $20, Seng's Aria bass guitar for $130 and a Stratocaster for $240. For those of you who are not familiar with this terminology, "Aria" is a brand name, "Bass" is an electric guitar which produces a very low pitched sound and "Stratocaster" is a very nice make of guitar by "Fender" which is a top guitar brand. (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong with anything). After this, we went to collect Seng's new Ephiphone at Holland. I kept hitting my head on the hanging jawstick burner outside the sellers house and intentionally committed the incident to memory to put it up here.  I should start doing my homework tomorrow. If not, I'll be in deep shat... The counter has been up for 2 days now and I've got 50+ hits already. Exellent! People do read! I'll continue sharing my life with you. Inclusive of sporadic periods of pseudo-intellectual thought. Here's me being humble again... Yay! *rolls eyes* There was something else I wanted to say but I forgot. No matter. Good night.  Here's a thought- Man who goes to sleep with smelly butt, wakes up with smelly fingers.
