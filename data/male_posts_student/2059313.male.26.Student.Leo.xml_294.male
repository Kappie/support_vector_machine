"well you got to think with a girl like that any love at all, is better than nothing... is better than nothing" - Matchbox Twenty - girl like that   "If it were up to me, she would know that she'll be the one, when I'm dead, will use my bed and she'll spend her life, thinking of us and making a fuss." - Rooney - If It Were Up to Me   Yes, you read correctly, I DID IT!  I asked her out.  She came to Richmond this morning on business and we went out to breakfast, and then I rode along with her to one of her clients.  When she dropped me off, I asked her.  I'm pretty sure that it can't be misconstrued as anything other than what I meant it to be.   [Important excerpt from conversation]   Me:  Y'know, I always have a great time with you.  Her:  I have a lot of fun with you, too.  Me:  I may be going out on a limb here, but I'd like to take you out sometime.    [plain, simple, to the point, right?]   Her:  That sounds great.  Yeah, we'll go out sometime. [big smile]  [end of important dialogue... not direct quotes, general gist of conversation]   So there you have it.  My heart is pounding, my pulse is racing, and I feel as if I'm out of breath.  But I love it.  If nothing else, this is a mountain I've climbed and conquered.  Hopefully it'll be easier if I ever have to do it again.  Is this the end... or is it merely the beginning?  I can't wait to find out!
