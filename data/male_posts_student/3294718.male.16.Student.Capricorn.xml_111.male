Also, my second semester EB class didn't allow me to stay up as late and also cut into my reading time. Now, it has been the summer that has stopped the reading. There has been so much going on and just sitting around seems sooo appealing in this comfortable heat.   In the last few days, I have fought against this comfort and have picked up a book. Right now, I am in the process of reading  Salem's Lot . After that, I have the 3rd Tales of the Otori book lined up. Following is  American Gods . Afterwards, I plan on finishing the classics  Don Quixote  and  Beowulf .   When I get done with all of that, who knows what I will read. I think I will go back and re-read ASoIaF and some of my favorite Timothy Zahn books.  Today, I think I am going to tear off the trim on my front doors on my car. I really don't want to do this but I have to to see what size the speakers are. Plus, it sounds kinda fun. Maybe, I will just call Best Buy and ask the speaker people what size speaker fits...
