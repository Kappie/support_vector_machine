May term schedule and registration sheets were handed out yesterday, so that gives another thing to look forward to.  Why summer is so much better: long days it's not cold out anymore, so coats aren't needed NO SCHOOL!!!! *no homework too* MITY riding a bike-I can get to just about anywhere on two wheels *racing comes along with that* open windows on the house playing loud music with the windows open fresh air reading books outside *or in a tree...lol* lotsa parties riding in a convertible fishing, even though I never do... eating outside the satisfaction received from killing a goddamn mosquito MITY, again (session B this time) chillin' seeing old friends...  Well, there very well could be many more, but I don't want to take the time to type them all. That pretty much sums it all up. I used to like winter more than summer, and now I look back and say, "what the f@#%?" Oh, and I forgot the part of earning tons of money so I can actually buy stuff and pay off my debt to Best Buy. It doesn't look like I'll be getting any wedding jobs, so I'll just expand my monopoly on the business of lawn mowing in St. Paul Park. I need money so bad-I'm dead broke. Maybe I'll even get started on my movie this summer...on a really really low budget.  No quote this time, but maybe next.
