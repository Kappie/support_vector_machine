Do you ever feel like a doll and you don't want to play dress up with your best friend Ken? Well that is how I feel.  I did Habitat stuff Saturday morning, and then I hung out with Josh and Meghan. We were gonna go job hunt but we never quite got around to it, lol. We went to the swap meet to exchange some cheap luggage Meghan got from this Chinese man. His wife got pissed when Meghan took the bags back, lol. Oh well. Then Josh wanted flags, so we headed out east for the outdoor swap meet. We spend an hour looking for it, and when we got there, no one was there. It was hella windy, so we left and went to dinner at Green Valley Rancho, at the buffet. It was good, although we stood in line for an hour. I don't know why, but I guess it was worth it. I didn't want to tell them this, but I kinda had too. Josh is embarrassing in public. He is loud, obnoxious, and yea. But he is still a great guy. I'm just different then he is I guess. Oh well. Meghan and Josh are happy with each other (as apparent with the sounds coming from her room as I get out of the shower at her place.) Oh well.  Then today my parental units and I went to the outlet mall on Charleston and shopped. I need pants. Only two pairs of my jeans fit, but sadly, I didn't find any. Oh well.  We then went to DSW, for shoes. I didn't find any. After that, we went to Borders and got some books. I got a book titled 'Project X', 'The Pleasure of My Company', and 'The Art of War.' 'The Art of War' is for my math project and 'Project X' and 'The Pleasure of My Company' are for my English project. Then I came home, and I am getting ready to call Aunt Mary about her coming to town for my Uncle's Elvis wedding.
