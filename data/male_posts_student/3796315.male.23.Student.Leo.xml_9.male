As mentioned earlier, our neighbour came over for dinner (Dominic, Jinghui and Geraldine). The dinner started at 930pm... Man that was late ya. Final menu for the night: Malay style grilled chicken, stewed beef, fried cabbage, baked nuggets, fish fingers, 9-layer kueh and curry.    I didn't eat much because I had quite a mouthful when I did the cooking. I have to finish a bowl of  Mee sua  and a red egg, which is super filling. Took quite a number of photos on Michelle digital cam, but I think the card is corrupted or what, the photos weren't there anymore when I tried to uploda into the computer.  Those photos that are nice are in the SD card. Will try to upload again tom, hopefully everything is still there.    I thought there isn't any cake because WX says the 9-layer kueh is the birthday cake. But in the end, towards the end of the dinner, our neighbour brought the cake in. Jinghui bought the blackforest cake from St Micheal. Lots of thanks ya, Jinghui and neighbours.    I got a good luck bear as bday present. Woah, that's my favourite carebear? haha, i think must be Michelle idea as i had told her before. Thanks guys for the effort you all made the difference by going that extra mile. Talking about " extra mile "... thanks to WX and Michelle for the call. Though not a success, I do appreciate the things you guys have done. And to Dominic, sorry hor.    Alright, a new chapter of my life has began. Once again, thanks to the people of unit 1 and 2 of 50 Durham street; including WX, Serene, Michelle, Geraldine, Dominic and Jinghui.    Ok gtg, tomorrow is a brand new day. The birthday boy
