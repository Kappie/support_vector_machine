Mike came with us which was great cause without him there i would have commited suicide.  Got to know him a lot better on this trip, he's a pretty cool guy.  Missed everyone a lot, it got boring up there, and the lake was so crowded, it was ruff.  Fireworks were going off everywhere last night.......then the power went out, it was awesome, then you could really see the stars last night, and the moon was full too........wish i had melinda there.......lol. It was a great weekend, woulda been a lot better if it was less people though.
