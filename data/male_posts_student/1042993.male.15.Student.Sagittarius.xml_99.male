Tonight will be the last live episode at the old TechTV building and on the 16th everybody will begin the move to LA.  Kevin, Sarah, Dan, and a few others will be making the move.  Leo is gone and will be working on Call For Help 2.0 in Canada througout August and September.  He will be going to Toronto, Canada one week per month to tape 4 episodes per day that week.  Patrick has officially left, but not because of G4's stupidity, but because he wanted to leave the company finally (not to mention the fact that his bride-to-be doesn't want to live in LA).  So, it looks like Kevin, Sarah, and Dan are the only original "on-air-talent" that will be moving.  This means only one thing... the rest of the roles will be filled by G4 staff.  Ick... "Games! Games! Games!".  What's going to happen when somebody calls and asks a question?  "Well, I don't know the answer to that, but have you played this new game yet??? It's grrreaattt!"  I think this is going to make me sick.  Everybody says good-bye to the old set and everybody they cared about tonight at 7.  Then they start packing.  The new LA-G4-TSS will be premiering on the new network sometime in September (from what I understand).  Nobody really knows what the new set will look like, but I can imagine that it will be as big of a change as from the old basement to the "pent-house loft" that they found as their home in this current set.  I want everything to just go away and return to normal.  Why must stupid G4 change everything?  It just doesn't make sense to me.  Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?! Why?!   Why can't they just understand how we as ZDTV~TechTV long-time fans feel?  We care about the changes!  We don't like them.  At all...  It's not just a network to us.  It's a community.  It's more of a lifeform!  It's alive -- it lives within each of us.  We all love and care about TechTV and we never want to see it go away.  But, as most things do, it has to come to an end.  G4 has to ruin it.  Oh well.
