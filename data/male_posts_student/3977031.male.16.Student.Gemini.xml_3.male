I will be scouring my bulk mail folder of my YaHoo! e-mail account (the address of which will never be posted on The Blog) periodically and posting the funniest subject lines or sender names along with my take on them.      From: Lewis Baker    Subject: There's a slut on your desk...     This was obviously sent by a psychic's website.      From: Expansive    Subject: For Larger and Firmer Breast     Why can I only enlarge one breast? What if I, like most other humans, have two breasts that are the same size? How would I choose just one breast? If I enlarged one breast would it make my other breast jealous? Would enlarging only one breast show favoritism toward one breast? Then there is the fact that enlarging only one of them would make me unbalanced which would eventually lead to back problems because of said unbalancedness (Yes, I made that word up, but only because it sounds good there.) of my breasts, but in this grand country, the good old US of A, I would be able to sue the person who enlarged just one of my breasts for millions of dollars in damages.      From: Unknown (Courtesy of my father)    Subject: Can you really increase your wee-wee size?     Now the penis enlargement industry has targeted boys ages 3-10. This once again proves that it is never too early to be insecure about your manhood.
