I’ve heard that before somewhere, but that thought just came from nowhere that afternoon. So I was decided. As soon as my class was over I jumped into my truck and I hit the road anxiously. I got home fairly quickly, but followed by some ignored stop signs yelling at me for respect. I shut them up and walked towards the front entrance. I opened the door and saw my mother-in-law in the living room watching her dull soap opera, I mechanically nodded to her and skipped some routinary questions. I looked around and I knew it. I went to the kitchen, my two-year-old daughter was sitting on her chair in front of the dinning table. I took a big breath, gave her a kiss, neared her ear and proceeded. I declared the obvious information to her. She listened to me. Next, she moved her head back and looked at me, keeping silence for two or three seconds with an expression that confirmed her understanding of what I meant. Then, she looked at the piece of paper laying on the table in front of her, looked for a crayon, grabbed it, and said to me with the cutest voice in the world: “Paint?” Undoubtedly, her brilliant answer made much more sense than my foolish attempt. We drew and painted silly faces. We loved each other forever.
