[Chorus] Look inside and see the part that is killing me I don't wanna be alone in my life  I'm not gonna die if the sun will always rise somewhere I can confide and I won't be alone.  In between lines are words revealed hiding a secret hate that mass appeals. victim to the production of mental concrete walls apathetic beings unevolved with thoughts unsolved. No more reason to stay for it neutral position is what you'll die in. Stay optimistic and in a minute you'll be laughin  [Chorus] I'm not gonna die if the sun will always rise somewhere I can confide and I won't be alone.  [Sub Verse] Open your mind... realize you'll never have to stand in line Open your mind... realize you'll never have to stand in line.  [Chorus] Look inside and see the part that is killing me I don't wanna be alone in my life  I'm not gonna die if the sun will always rise somewhere I can confide and I won't be alone.
