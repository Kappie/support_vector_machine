There was a mufti day on wednesday which was good, but it's been raining all week, and I now have a sore throat which is hindering my ability to talk and to drink tea. There's a 3 day weekend this weekend - but I'm more focused on a shorter 4 day week next week, and the fact that I get to miss french on monday - And according to that *points up* I'd be a heretic, sounds more cool than any of the others =P
