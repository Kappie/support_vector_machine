     
      back to cross-country tomorrow morning (a 2 day hiatus for driving)! I can't wait! Driving's fun but i'm in the car with 2 others and we each drive for 50 minutes, so for an hour and a half I do nothing. Josh and Luke could pass the classroom portion if they did the homework. tis very ridikilis. cept today we watched high-speed chases for the last 10 or so minutes of class. they are purty cool especially with drunk guys.
