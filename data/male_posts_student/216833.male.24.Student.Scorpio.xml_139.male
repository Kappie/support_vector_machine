I never left ventured past the doorway, not even to get the mail.   I am lacking inspiration these days. I fail to self-start any project or any form of productive activity. I havn't picked up a book in a month, I havn't painted or doodled in about the same time. work-eat-workout-watch movies.  I did see Don't say a Word and Reservior Dogs tuesday night. Those were fun and late. I forgot to take them back last night. I think I am gonna go send my grandma a postcard.   current mood:  bored current music: samiam
