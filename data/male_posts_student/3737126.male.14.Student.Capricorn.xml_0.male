First of all, why roninsword.blogspot.com?  ro= Ro ehl Nin= Ni√± o minus the '-' above the 'n'. the 'sword' has two meanings:  Ronin's Word: stands for my opinion  Ronin Sword: stands for my weapon  Basically, it means that my opinion is my weapon, and that is all. I do not wish to be held for libel, and I do not wish to open another 'damn' chain letter in Friendster. I promise, from this day on, I will only open those posts from rico, panji, jiguli and other trusted people who post surveys (you can say if it is a chain letter)  5. Stupid chain letter which you will open because it is the spell that killed Harry's parents (wrong thing to open folks, nothing related with Harry Potter, and it will strike fear to your hearts.  Okay, enough of the stupid thing. So what basically made this day different:  4. Noli me Tangere. 15th chapter. Ahead of schedule actually  3. 4. Tanglaw Eliminations Final Round. And they thought they will be eliminated until...  2. Club Selling. I was made to speak for our club (tatak tanglaw, the club of our school paper. I am the associate managing editor for the 2nd year in the row.) and...  1. Tanglaw Meeting. We got suggestions fomr the Photo Editor of the school paper of DLSU, an alumnus of CSQC. We got lots of ideas. We hope the admin approves it.  So that wraps it up. Be careful with opening bulletin board chain letters and be happy.  The campus journalism act of 1991 was great.  P.S. Bakit webteam si Rico?
