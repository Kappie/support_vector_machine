Plus yesterday I was with m8's and expanding my social skills and today I was with m8's who I have known throughout high school!! How much better can things be?? Alot! But what the heck! =D  Anywho! I can't wait for the 6 days to go through, yet at the same time I can wait and I want to do so much in them!! I have to also make a list of all the things my parents have to do while I am away, such as pick up my gcse reslts and sort my college placement!  And that's another thing! College placement! Eeeeck! Oh and gcse results - which I am doubting heavily! =( But alas, if they don't go well..no college placemnt to die over because of!  Anywho, I hope all will go great - hope being the key word! Will write in this more!  Andy
