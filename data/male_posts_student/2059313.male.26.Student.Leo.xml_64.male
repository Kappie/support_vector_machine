Some of the best conversations I've ever had are with her.  She's such an intelligent person.  Anyway, I'm kind of straying from the point.  So, I had parked in a parking garage, like I always do when I visit her.  I was planning on grabbing some cash from an ATM in order to pay for the parking when I left.  Well, this is where the strangeness starts.  I try an ATM, my pin # won't work.  So I call my friend, and she doesn't have any cash and wouldn't be able to get any.  I ask her if there are any banks or businesses that might cash a check around there, she directs me to a few, so I walk to a couple businesses and noone will cash a check, not even with purchase or anything.  I go to two different banks and of course they won't cash checks drawn on another bank or they won't cash a check unless you have an account.  So I call my friend back.  And basically the plan was for me to just hang around in downtown until she got off work, and then she could drive me around the rest of the day, I could get some cash from SOMEWHERE and I'd ride back with her in the morning.  So that began my exploration of downtown Lexington.  I sat inside Starbucks for about 30-45 minutes, then I walked around and looked inside stores and the like.  I finally found a place to waste a good amount of time.  There's this nice Restaurant/Billiards Hall/Bar inside Heritage Hall called Yesterday's.  The atmosphere is really neat and nice.  They play a lot of blues and jazz music.  I was the only person in there other than the bar tender. Eventually playing pool by yourself just gets old, and by that time it was a little after four o'clock.  I started doing a little more exploring of downtown, and then my friend called me (she's super-sweet) to check up on me and see how I was doing, and to offer me a seat in the lobby of the office she works in.  Since there wasn't too much longer left before she was free to go, I went ahead and met her there.  After that, I went with her to see her father in the hospital.  And I had a very nice visit with her parents and her.  It almost didn't even feel like we were in a hospital, we were joking around and just talking about this and that... the only thing that kept reminding me we were in a hospital was the fact that a nurse would check in every so often to take his blood pressure, or to make sure his IV was still chugging along.  After that, she had rehearsal, and I tagged along.  After rehearsal she had plans to go out with some of her gal friends, and I tagged along there as well.  I felt kind of bad, because I know that people need to have their away spaces and times and that sort.  The whole night I felt like an old piece of luggage being drug around...  She made me feel like a jewel carried on a pillow, and displayed me proudly.
