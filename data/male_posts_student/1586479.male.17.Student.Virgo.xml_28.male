It is always awkward when religion comes up seeing as we have such different views on things. One such issue is that I have decided to serve a two year mission for my church after high school. My dad has slowly tried to talk me out of this over the years, and its really hard when I have decided to do it and my own father doesn't support it. Anyway, my dad doesn't only disagree with my decision, but he also does not believe that I'm ready to "sell" my religion to others. He says "you need to try other brands to make sure the one your selling is the right one." Sure, ok, but what if I know my religion is completely true? I respect other religions: many have very interesting ideologies and truths, but I know mine it totally true. I'm sorry if that sounds arrogant. Then we talked about how I knew, and I got into direct personal revelation from God through prayer, and then he  told  me that I cannot tell revelation from personal biases and opinions that have been  brainwashed  into me since I was a child. He then preceded to tell me how my religion tried to keep people from asking questions. He told me how my church works. He's never been to my church. How does that work? It is totally not true; I question my faith all the time and ask questions galore at church, all of which are answered in a straightforward, acceptable manner. I rather pride my religion on its openness to questions. But my father told me a was a mindless follower because I did not read the same books he has read. These books openly bash my religion and all that it is based on and the facts in them has been proven totally false. Still,  I  am a zombie mind slave.  Sorry if that didn't make sense. It's late. But I hope you get my point. I got to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, also known as the Mormons. Just in case anybody didn't know.  And I should have used different wording: it is not  my  religion, rather the religion I practice.
