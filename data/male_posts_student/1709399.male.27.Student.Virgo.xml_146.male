It was a very good movie portraying the verbal duels between a Communist  a Capitalist . The dialogues were Razor sharp ( Thanks to Madan of Anandha Vikatan)  the movie ends by saying  "Goodliness is Godliness". The title isn't surprising Considering that Kamal himself is a self-confessed agnostic. As always , the movie was not a big success at the box office , I later learnt.
