Anyways, today I'm fucking bored.Igot aSoulfly digipak earlier and I love it! I met Chris in town today and drank lots of wine with a bunch of people I didn't know (save Daniel).There was asweet girl there called Jo and Chris seems to be totally in love with her... and he rarely loves anyone.I got a letter saying my school's having a reunion after like... half a year. But it will be good to see some old mates I ain't seen in a while.I will post again when I can be bothered.
