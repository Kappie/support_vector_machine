To "foster class relationships", I joined the class soccer team...as goalie. Got elevated to first choice due to making some wonderful saves during training and in friendlies. So much for the good stuf...I'm now in danger of losing my job due to some terrible games in the last week. Our first half of the first leg was on Tuesday. Refree kayu. Luckily, after a discussion, the score was changed. Wahoo, o pledge to do better next time...sigh. Now, got to buy a jersey as class t-shirt. $21.Colour and details to bedecided later.        My oral exam is tomorrow!.  9% of total grade. I selected  Is the Moon Tired?  by Christina Rosetti. It's short. Haha. But I've memorised it and my answers to potential questions All ready! Except to background of the author...going to do that now. And, lessons are getting better! That's right, even Chinses and MAths! YAY!
