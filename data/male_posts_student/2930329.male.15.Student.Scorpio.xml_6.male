How you ask?! I cheated? How you ask?! Mr.biggs didnt see that i had somebody elses book on the floor open with all the anwsers to the exam available at the end of my pencil!? But i know that if I realy Did ace The Exam then hes gonna be Curious on how the hell i pulled an All-nighter? which is what i did last night any how. And as for Sheila? Well lets just say that things seem back to normal and yet at the same time, Acqward? it just doesnt seem the same? Sheila isnt going out with Justin any more which is sad because he was the only boyfriend I could laugh with and not feel like a Complete Dumbass. I feel bad because I ruined what they had? which is something special, Each other... I only wish that i could have somebody to love? which hasnt been in present forever? But then again Sheila's options are always many and never few, which then again is something that i wish i had but, apparently not.(LOL)In GYM this morning with Mr.Gondars Dictator like routine we all (Us guys) cramed on the bus and made our way downtown to the ball park along with the girls health class bus behind us. I hung out with a group of people i hanged-out with last year And realized what fun i had with them last year and the main subject was about embers nipple rings, which was funny cause all the guys wanted to see safety pins but the best they could get was the outline. And hung out back on the bus with different groups of people and then thought of making a run for McDonalds and then My house which was two blocks away, but everybody mandated that they would if it was the last day of school. And then i find that my Dad asks if i want To do Stuff with him at The completely Wrong Time? Like Fishing and playing the guitar or whatever, its all about time management.  But as always my dads auto response was the same "Am i Taking up to much of your Time!?" Whatever Dad. And then he wonders why im in my room or on the pc or outside and i say "Cause thats what normal Teenagers do Dad, and i would like to avoid you..." And in other news! Kieth is wierding me the hell out. Is he trying to pull a Ronnie by Being nice and trying to get a good word with Sheila? I dont think so? He seemed pretty capable of doing that all by himself at lunch today.( I chose not to sit with her because of "Jamie?") But i finished my algebra exam early and cruised the halls with Ronnie and gave him the cheat sheet to the English Exam, I made my way to the cafetiria and to my suprise it was munchkin man starring me down? I had no clue what the hell he was up to but I wasnt to interested, so i sat two tables away with a smerk on my face but in no time at All He Urges me to sit with "Them" and so i hesitated and decided there was no other choice but to? (What does he want?) And before I no it Brittney Ingall (?) and Nakesha (?) (Not black!) are calling me by that horrid Nickname "Wadell" (It just stuck ok!?) but at least somebody was behind me and showed that i wasnt The Laughing stock of the herd, Kieth , by saying "No you stupid dikes, his name is wade? or Nathan? Which one" and without doubt i stuck with "Wade" Brittney replied "Shutup you faggot?!" but they were obviously just teasing each other which is a very confusing game i usualy did not take interest into by any social standard. But before long Kieth and I were talking about stupid Shit and how by accident how he shaved his head bald? (Which i thought was funny) but he said he didnt realy care about what his hair looked like.  And then Somehow!? he gets the Dam nerve to ask me if im Gay?! Jesus Fucking Christ!? It was for certain that he was. But am I Sexist,Racist,Byist,or Prejudice? No, not in any way shape or for an I. And then he later asks me if i have any hot cousins or sisters? And so wit takes over with Cockyness and I said with unextreme offense "Well, YOu could go out with my cousin? After all He is Gay?" He got the joke and Laughed. But i am confused by him in so many God Dam ways it's not funny why i cant figure him out? I mean with most people it's so easy to figure what and who they realy are but Kieth was always with somebody so it was like there was no compatibility to "Figure" him out by probing into his every thought.
