This of course served a problem because we store all of our stuff in the new cafeteria. As I was walking to and from carrying stuff to use, I walked past Chris. Chris was there with his girlfriend. I see no problem about him hanging out with his girl. But I know that time he spends with his other friends could be sometimes better spent helping his team. There is no burden put on him by becoming captain. It's just I feel like now maybe there could have been others who would fit his job better. What am I saying... He's team leader for a reason and he has to learn how to lead. I just have to help him because like the others he's never seen us lose.
