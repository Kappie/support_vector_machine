I saw you yesterday as you were talking with your friends.  I waited all day  hoping you would want to talk with me too. I gave you a sunset to close  your day  and a cool breeze to rest you--and I waited. You never came. It hurt me--but  I still love you  because I am your friend.  I saw you sleeping last night and longed to touch your brow so I spilled moonlight upon your face.  Again I waited,  wanting to rush down so we could talk. I have so many gifts for you! You awoke and rushed off to work.  My tears were in the rain.   If you would only listen to me!  I love you!  I try to tell you in blue skies and in the quiet green grass. I whisper it in leaves on the trees and breathe it in  colors of flowers , shout it to you in mountain streams, give the birds love songs to sing. I clothe you with warm sunshine and perfume the air with nature scents.  My love for you is deeper than the ocean,  and bigger than the biggest need in your heart.  Ask me! Talk with me!  Please don't forget me.  I have so much to share with you!  I won't hassle you any further.  It is YOUR decision.  I have chosen you and I will wait--  I love you, Your Friend,     JESUS   God, I'm an ass hole! I even piss off Jesus.
