I totally forgot his name, but he's the band director at Glennbrook, our primary rehearsal place. He also taught 'B' corps in like 96, 97, and 98, so it's dandy.   Ummm we spent a whole lot of time working outside in the hot sun...judging by my sunburn, it was a damn good rehearsal. We ran around the entirity of the school, and I returned the favor to all those skinny kids who pushed me during running block last year by running with the kids in the back. Playing cheerleader, not letting em give up. It felt really good, mentally AND physically, being that person, pushing em on....cuz it forced me not to give up myself. I felt better that I ever have, this season is definitely looking better for me, at least, getting in shape is a wonderful thing.  Hornline had limited numbers today, I'm not sure what happened, and where the hell everyone went, but yah ok. We still sounded amazing though. Jessika came, and so did Calvin, and they both said we sounded the biggest they've ever heard. Very exciting. I wanted to get a recording for distribution purposes, but we didn't do ensemble, and we were in the gym, soooo yeah.   I'll try to get the rest of the BDBers in here to update, mine is kinda lame. And away I go!
