On top of that, I had to set up a bank account, get a library card, have a dentist appointment, walk back to the bank, then go home. I'm worn out and tomorrow my plan is to lie in bed all day and play games.  Later on I'm off to the shops to find some old Dreamcast games, after being inspired by an article on Teletext's Games Central and realising I bought a Dreamcast and have about 3 games for it. If I can, I'm getting: Crazy Taxi (arcade driving thing), Dead or Alive 2 (Tekken with, err, interactive fighting arenas.), Confidential Mission (with a lightgun at some point, it's fun shooting the TV), Ready 2 Rumble (2?)(Boxing game with big hair), Soul Calibur (Tekken with swords), Virtua Tennis (...Virtual tennis) and Metropolis Street Racer (It has London in!).   That's tomorrow's activities sorted!
