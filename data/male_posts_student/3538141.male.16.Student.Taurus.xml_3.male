All my phone calls tend to be stricly 'business-like' e.g. 'are you training tonight' or 'do you want to go out to dinner' (ok, so not technically business, but they have a motive).  And so I ask myself why, when I am bored, do I not casually call friends?  I have thought of a few potential reasons:  1.  I have only just gone pay monthly.  Calling people used to be expensive.  If this is the sole reason, then within a few months I'll be calling people like there's no tomorrow.  2.  In this impersonal modern age, where texting and moreover IM have taken over, is it worth phoning people?  It seems to me that for casual chatting, IM is the way we go.  The problem is that my ex-gf has been very busy with one thing or another, and so hadn't been on msn.  But as soon as I phoned her, she said 'erm... why are you calling me?'  I didn't take this personally because we then went on to have an amicable conversation.  I did the same thing when picking up the phone yesterday from a friend of mine.  So do phone calls have to have a purpose, even between friends?  Yet how many hours do boyfriend/girlfriend spend on the phone?  Even good friends do not seem to do this.  And that brings me on to my third possibility:  3.  Am I being a pest, or will somebody get the wrong idea?  I've just found something about which I am quite insecure.  And I never knew it before.  I'm scared now.  But it has happened.  I think part of the thing about a phone call is that the timing is unpredictable, and the person on the receiving end has to take the call.  With a text, they can answer whenever, and on IM they are only online if they want to talk.  So I found myself the other day positively annoyed when even a good friend called at a bad moment.  So do people feel the same when I phone?  Is it not just easier to send them a text, or have casual conversation on IM?  And the real problem I had with phoning my ex-gf was this - would she get the wrong idea?  We had never spoken on the phone before we went out, for I asked her out the day after we met.  And our break-up was confused and disjointed.  And I called her a lot during that time, because I didn't want to lose her.  So if I called again, would she think that I still wasn't over her?  Something I must explain here.  She does not have an easy life at home, and I obviously still care about her so I didn't want to cause her any unnecessary stress.  By calling her, would she get the wrong idea and worry about me?  Was this why, at the start of the call, the awkward 'erm... why are you calling me?'  I handled the situation (I had pre-planned it) by saying 'it's kinda immature to just stop talking to someone after breaking up with them.  So here I am'.  We had a nice conversation, and I don't think she got the wrong idea.  And yet I was worried about this phone call beforehand, and I must still care about it to be blogging now.  4.  This one only just occurred to me.  I board in school during the week, in which time I am constantly among my friends.  I see too much of them.  And during the week I don't have a huge amount of time to call any other friends.  Is it that on the weekends, I like a bit of time to myself and my best friend from outside school (who I see every weekend anyway)?  Is it that I have so much social contact during school that I avoid it slightly outside?  Is the phone becoming more formal and less a part of our everyday lives?  Or is it just to do with me?
