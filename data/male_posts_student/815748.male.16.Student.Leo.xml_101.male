Loren's rarely online when I'm online, and when he is, he doesn't have anything good to say.  Melody's online from time to time, but only for like two seconds.  She keeps pulling a Sarah Blanks.  Richie's the only good person, and he's online more because his timescale is different from you Jewtonians.  But the others - John, Jonny, Jason (whoa all Js) - fugghedaboudit.  I really need to talk to a few of you guys, especially L and Mel, since they're good for consultation.  Tomorrow I leave for this Normandy trip, for three or four days.  I don't know, I just don't know, what I should do.  We're visiting the site of D-Day, and in six days is V-Day, I don't know if I can do it in time.  Au secours!
