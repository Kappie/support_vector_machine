Are LA people the only ones that talk about area codes like this?   I still feel weird about not wanting to work at Nielsen anymore... the part of me that hates being a quitter hates this... but I can't work with Lisa or Thelma anymore. Lisa's not the type that will ever leave me alone while I work there. Thelma just really upsets me for not coming to talk to me and trying to work against me.  I'm having lunch with the girls later and I'm meeting up with George and Julia later for drinks.  **
