Both candidates showed strong support for bank robbery and suspicious diaper bags.  Politics aside, this was the most exciting thing to happen to Davenport since Mayor Yerington appeared on the Today Show with exposed chest hair.  The Bush Policy/Statement/Comment/Remark I Agree With of the Week: Davenport needs to fix the pothole problem.  Now it is time to address a concern that many of my devout readers may have.  In some recent posts I have used some mysterious code talk.  For example I recently said, "73's de KCØSVT."  I'm sure this confused an average reader.  But an above average reader would know that I am just using some amateur radio lingo.  You see folks, I just received my amateur radio technician class operator's license.  In short, that means I can use a really long range walkie talkie.  Us "hams" have all sorts of fun codes that makes yammering on a little easier (especially in CW, or Morse Code), and more nerdish.  "73's" means "best regards."  "De" means "this is."  And finally, KCØSVT is my call sign.  You ever wonder why the van I drive has a funny license plate?  N9CI is my old man's call sign.  Now, KCØSVT is no good so in a few weeks I will probably be WØNJC (NJC being my initials of course).  So just try and ignore the hand growing out of my skull, that's just a little effect of some RF radiation.
