Confused?   It gets worse.   If the second two don't get the prey then the fourth gets to eat one third of the the other three. As if that's not bad enough.   The first guy, since he is missing a third of his body cant run his ass off' obviously, so the other two have to carry him around, but since the other two also have a third missing from them they couldn't run either, except the fourth man must choose his area to eat carefully, he should only take the right half from one and the left half from the other.  If however the first three fail for a second time, they cannot be eaten again because that would be death.   So they have to revert to going to white castle.  This is were the original meaning of the word blogging comes from.
