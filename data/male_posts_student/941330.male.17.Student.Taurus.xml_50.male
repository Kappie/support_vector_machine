"uncle jack, go on the gondola carts." "no, that rope looks dangerous." "how can it be? look at all those people riding." "my point exactly!" then we drove up highway 1 and the picturesque ca coastline (it's even better when it's blocked by trees) and my uncle told me that the chinese invented rap.   today woke up at 9:45 (you don't kno how hard that is for me) to play basketball at school. no one was there, so i met joanna, adrienne, the krimkeviches, and tim teaching at the writing camp. owen's sister was there too. this little girl stole my ball and started dribbling better than me. finally amanda, audrey and tiffany came, and we shot around. amanda said her secret dream was to one day get an octopus stuffed animal. alex and kevin arrived, and alex airballed and hit amanda's thigh. we went to togo's where we rated how hot people were. amanda gave shane west a 7. paul walker? "o, 5, i don't really like white guys." alex: "but you gave shane west a 7!" amanda: "well i don't like pretty boys, and paul walker's a pretty boy." alex: "but shane west is the prettiest boy, he was in a walk to remember." amanda was stumped there. me, kevin and alex went to my house; kevin wanted to sleep but he was scared that alex would "rape [him] in the ass." alex even tried...but kevin woke up. haha.
