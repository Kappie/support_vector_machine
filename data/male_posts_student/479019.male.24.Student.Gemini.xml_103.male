It's pretty much a blatant rip off of what a certain Canadian friend of mine has on her page. The javascripting for it still needs some work, but the basics have been laid out for it, which is a good thing.  In addition to that burst of creativity, I got more of my history paper done. I've titled it  Watching the Right, the Left, and the Center in “Blockade” . The title is play on a song by  Anti-Flag  from their  Underground Network  album (2001). I have about 4 pages done, counting the title page.... counting just the body portion of the paper... I'm about 20% through with it... that's assuming I just do the minimum 15 pages. I could always potentially go over that length in the body depending on what I cram into the paper.  I should go to bed.  ***
