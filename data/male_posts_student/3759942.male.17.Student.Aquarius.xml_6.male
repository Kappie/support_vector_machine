Once upon a time, In the pathetic Server OF SK or WZ, The aHaHs were enjoying themselves as usual, PwNiNg People away. Then, the aHaHs were being observed/analysed by another group of people..( I cant freaking remember what the heck CM clan tag was then...Note: The Clan name changed quite a couple of times before arriving to the Current one |[CM]| )  As I was saying, We the aHaHs were simply to PRO, not forgetting the fact that we were famous at the same time. Many clans were eyeing for us ( 3 considered alot? )And we really couldnt resist the temptation of joining a prestigious clan... ( SS, WZ )Sadly, none of the clan approached us...But then, This mad arse called Kerplunkz wanted us to be in |[CM]|.   The aHaHs hesistated for quite some time before agreeing to join as the clan |[CM]| was relatively new. But, being the infamous aHaHs, we decided to take a gamble, a gamble which had probably taken quite an amount of our time/effort...  BANG ! CHIANG ! CLASH ! BOOOOOOHOOOOOO! The day |[CM]| was born...3/3/04...Time Passed quickly. Seconds passed like minutes...Hours passed like weeks. We had lotsa of fun over weeks...which aint gonna last long...  Finally...The day had come for |[CM]| to prove herself. Clan |[CM]| had a match with Clan SB ( RedShift now ). Victory was ours and sweet it was! Celebration was held! Enemies Humiliated...For a 2-week clan could win a I-DONT-CARE-HOW-OLD clan.  Then, |[CM]| was HUNGRY for WAR/RECOGNITION. We Decided to challenge a 3-year-old clan. Ambitions were high. Confidence at stake. Result? Day Of Defeat/Destrution...Couldnt be better.Causulty was pretty much higher than WW2 + WW1...  But surely, We will definitely Prevail! We became more ambitious! We recruited more Chao Recruits in. That was the time.....|[CM]| was at its prime...We were simply unbeatable...( Watch Channel 8 and get what that means )  More battles were won along the path to victory...As a result, |[CM]| became even more ambitious...We got The nWos in...which was actually a grave mistake...
