My brain dosnte work as well in the morning, its more just sitting stairing, remembering im supposte to be thinking, and trying to think again... Humm... i was going to basicly rewrite what was lost, but i cant rememeber what it was exactly, that i wrote, well i kinda can, but not at the same time.  One thing i remember, that i wish i didn't, was the bad news i got yesterday. Yeah so i found out that Kevin, the kid i was going to be rooming with at Ydaho is not comming anymore. Yes that really sucks for me. Every stupid semeseter i have to get new roomates, every semester, and im sick of it. Its like some kind of cosmic rule that every four months i have to get a new pool of friends, just really annoying. Anyway so now i have now real guy friends up there i can hang out with, and i dont know a soul im living with. I dont want to have to get to know a new room roomate, thats probably the worst part. I just know how i am, it takes me awhile to get warmed up to people and to feel comfortable around people so that i can be myself, so im not looking foward to being uncomfortable for however long it takes.   Oh yeah i also decided last night (though i doubt ill actually do anything about it) that i need to learn how to read menues, er perhaps just will myself to read them. Anyway last night i went to a mexican restraunt with my family, now its normal for me to be the last one to order, simply because im undesisive, but of late i cant even seem to bring myself to read the menu. Last night was the worse i have ever been, i didnt read one word of the menu, till it was my turn to order. So i just skimed the menu and pointed to somthing, witch turned out to be somthing on the lunch menu. After that i ordered what my mom got, 'cause it sounded alright.*  I have a really bad tast in my mouth, im going to drink somthing... brb... not that you, the reader, could tell that im gone, but if i tell you my actions its more like im actualy here telling you, the reader, myself... k hold on...     Im back.  After dinner we went by wal-mart and i finaly got a belt that i could put my confedriate states belt buckel on, im really pelased. In adition to the belt i found some cowboy boots i used back when i showed cows, and i have a cowboy hat, so i was wearing the boots yesterday feeling all western. This is not my new style or anything, but i just think its awsome so now when i go to the weekly country dance** i can look the part, im excited.  I miss dancing, though i fear i've forgoten so much. I really hope my sechdual works out so i can take the dance classes i want. I think it will as far as standard is conserned, i believe that the gols class is 8 in the morning, not happy about that but would be worth it. Unfortunatly i dont beleave latan will work out again this smester, and im sad for this thing. The ironic thing is i love to dance and take all these dance classes, but when i go to dances i hardly dance. Its partialy because how i dacne is too prpoer and needs way too much room for normal dances. If i was too dance like that at a normal dacne the girl would be wondering why my arms are so high, why im so close, why we keep running into people, and why i never look at her, i fear. (though the last thing she may appreciate..)  Wow if i just sit here long enough i can write a ton of stuff! Anyway sicne my power went out last night and i lost the post after that im really parinoid of loosing this post, i keep saving it to notepad. Did i mention that i want to build a computer?    * I would write what we ordered but i cant spell, and doubt i could spell what it was close enough to get on the spellcheckers radar... thats so sad.  ** I go to the country dance for the dancing not so much the music, but contry dancing is fun. In conjucntion with the country dance they have a swing dance in another room, witch i actualy perfer, and is more fun to dance. However less people go to the swing kids side because they go over there and get intimidated b/c if you are just learnting the Lindy hop looks really hard. To tell the turth im kinda intimdated myself to dance with a lot of the girls there, they all seem so much better than myself. Also the Lindy is a physical dance, and it really hard to talk while doing it, and it really tires you out, or gets you dizzy.
