Today was a rather uneventful. Calculus was good because of a maliciously evil test that I passed rather well. English was hell because of a maliciously evil test concerning the Grapes of Wrath applied on an AP level. Absolute insanity there. I shall never pass the AP exam.  Today we had another prompt from  urlLink A Dream of You . My resulting poetic attempt is entitled  Anticipate    Nature can live in the breast of a bird when it first spreads its honeycomb bones or it dies in an agonizing suffocation if a tendril of smoke leaks from a nearby factory to replace its dioxide but a chain has somehow formed around free will’s neck and I can no longer choose how I want to suffer.  The congress passed a few bills that don’t let a person slit their own throat or drink poison, it’s all illegal and against the law and if the cyanide doesn’t allow him freedom of choice then he goes straight to jail for attempted sanity.  Ringing on the pavement the dry sound of rubber in a battle of friction and resistance against asphalt and gravity, shoes that died with their owners are trying to pave a path back into Gaia, and their ghosts wander aimlessly in a delirium of real-world light and shadow world whispers.  Each person I run into feels like a shower of dry ice that never quite made it to sublimation and their skin is chilled with the temperature of a netherworld prison, each one of them is as dead as my mind tells me I am, though it still feels the cold.  There is a child who is sitting on the statue over there of a famous person who fought for pride who got off the ride who took the cyanide who found that in a frenzy of government she still cried when every man, woman, youth walking by her had eyes front, legs stiff because each of their minds were wiped from any suggestion of emotion.  The child can cry too but the child isn’t really alive, he wants to be but the shackles set by society are chafing his ethereal wrists and he isn’t free to join his God, his Allah, his Yahweh while the adamant scroll believers turn their head the other way and preach about the institution, not the principle.  Chipped into a stone that was thrown into an ocean a paranoid fool wrote Not Free, Not Free without the realization of what his mind would realize when a sky parted at the rift of time and the next black hole began to form.   Shorter than what I have done of late, but it suffices. i bid thee, mortals, a pleasant evening to-night. Cheers.
