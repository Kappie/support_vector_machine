I'm going to sit outside of a coffee shop, drinking iced coffee, and reading something I'm only reading because I want to read it.  but now the question is, do I read some Blake poems, a novel i was supposed to read for class, but was only able to read part of, or do i continue with the people's history of the united states?  I'm up to the 1950's in that one.
