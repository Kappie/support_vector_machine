There was one exhibition where it was all a Biology thing, so that wasn't really my cup of tea, but the wild life well...  The Wild Life exhibit has been renovated since I was last there (which is completely understandable as I haven't been there for several years). The blue walls are like a man made sky and it feels like you are in the mountains every once in a while (what with the large rock fixtures everywhere). Now this sounds like a load of crap...and I certainly am exaggerating a lot, but it is quite pretty looking. And whoever cleans the glass at the museum, I congratulate them, because I swear that you could not tell that there was glass there, it was so CLEAN! Excuse the exclamation. The Protagonist is out.
