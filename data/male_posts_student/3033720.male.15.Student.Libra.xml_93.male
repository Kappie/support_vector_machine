Dog jumped. Dog barked, ect. The list goes on and on. Only reason I am able to post this now is that I'm at a friend's house. However, being that I don't see getting the computer back in the foreseeable future, I will begin with some fairly constant audio posts. Now...What has been happening lately....  Cassy isn't moving. That's one important thing. Kinda weird, I went all year thinking that at the end I'd be saying goodbye, but now it's two more years with her around. Definitely a good thing, just weird.  A God forsaken commie nearly got me fired. The damned russkie, (her name is Zemifra) told the manager that I "barked" at her and was making her do everything on her own. The manager came out and let me know if I piss her off again and she quits I'm fired. In truth, some crazy guy had pulled me aside and I was just trying to earn a tip. I got my revenge later though, when she started to choke on some bread. Then she started throwing up and crying saying she wanted to be back in Russia with her mother.  I also bought a watch. And so concludes this long anticipated post. I bid you all farewell for x amount of time. 'Till then......I'm out.
