Becoming happy with creations of any inspirational type are hard to manage; for myself.  I took off to work a bit early today to find a used book store in downtown petaluma. I presumed that I was to be at work around 12:30 so I found a parking spot around 11 and took a nice brisk stroll down the sidewalk.  The air was invigorating and I was fresh and crisp like a conspicuously clean dollar bill. My white shirt was bright and starched and I had the top button lossened. I hadn't yet thrown on the tie, so I was feeling a bit free and fairly handsome. I stopped first at the petaluma goodwill to see if that happened to have an overhead projector. I also stolled down to the basement to see what they had in the way of an office desk. From there, I strolled over to Red Devil records where I have yet to make a purchase. They have some rad Jazz, indie, and punk vinyl. I asked the gent to point me towards the used book store and it happened to be a few doors down, three to be exact. The store was rad. Open, indepentantly operated and clean. I got the following: The Metamorphasis and The Trial by Franz Kafka as well as Survivor by Chuck Palahniuk. I have today off so after a bit of sleep I have some reading to do.  By the way! Cheers to you my friend!!! Drink one for me! TO LIFE!    current mood:  enthralled current music: bjork - post
