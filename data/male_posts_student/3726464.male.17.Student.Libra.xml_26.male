It was when you held my hand... that I found strength to carry on through life.  It was when you hugged me tightly... that all of my burdens suddenly subsided.  It was when you pressed your lips against mine... that I tasted the sweetness of paradise.  It was that charming face... that inspired me to live for a better life each day.  It was those eyes, full of love so true... that paved away all the fears and the worries of my weary heart.  It was that simple smile... that took my breath away.  It was that laugh, lingering through my ears... for once I felt like a child again so free from the cruelty and harshness of reality.  It was that gentle voice... that made me smile in those times when I mostly felt I had to give up.  It was those loving words put into actions... that gave me the courage to hold on.  It was you.. It is you... And it will forever be you... that will make my life complete.
