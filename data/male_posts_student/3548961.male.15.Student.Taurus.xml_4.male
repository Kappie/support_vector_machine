I didn't win my cleats, AGAIN. not cool i know but i think im just gonna get some when i get back from cali. incidently i bid on some indoors that i think are cool but brian doesn't. i don't care what he thinks, i like them. Alright, now to the good news...IM GOING TO THE  BAYERN MUNCHEN  and  MANCHESTER UTD  GAME. brian got tickets, they are in the nosebleeds ofcourse but hey, they were 40 bucks, the only good ones left were 150 so i think we did alright thank you very much. anyway, this is the chance of a lifetime, its gonna be great. Also im excited about a couplng of upcoming games in the very near future. This sunday is going to be a day to remember on the internation level...atleast for brian and i. the U.S./Granada game is on at 1 p.m. so GO U.S. (thats world cup quals...big stuff) and then at 2:45 p.m. (directly after the first game) its gonna be england vs. france...going to be a brilliant game. i think im for france though but im still undecided. anyway, that'll be big too. Well thats my life as it is right now, for those who do, thanks for reading, night night. love always -alex
