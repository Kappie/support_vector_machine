First, let's look at the definition of "object", as it pertains to this argument:  1.) Something perceptible by one or more of the senses, especially by vision or touch; a material thing.  That's the first definition, quoted from The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. Here are some other takes:  1.) Something material that may be perceived by the senses. 2.) Something mental or physical toward which thought, feeling, or action is desired.  That was from Merriam-Webster. So, now that we have established the definition of object, let's look at the word "material":                 n.          5.) A person who is qualified or suited for a position or activity. adj. 1.) Of, relating to, or composed of matter.  That was quoted from The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. I'm just using the definitions that pertain to this certain essay.  So, I'm pretty sure women are composed of matter. I'm also certain there are quite a few positions they are suited to fill.  *snicker*  And so it is ascertained that women are material things- thus showing that they also fit into the definition of objects.  Now, I don't mean to put anyone down by saying that. By using the reasoning of this case, men would also be considered objects. Therefore we are both equal in that respect. I was just trying to disprove an incorrect statement.
