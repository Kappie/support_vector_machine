Fittingly, he wasn't here when I got here - had to wait for him to clean out a poker tournament. And when he got here, he offered me a beer. Some things never change. :)  Looks like I'm finally about to win our online  urlLink Citadels  game. About time, to. I don't tend to win very much, and the last few summers I've tended to lose HARD. Just lucky I guess.  Happiness is showing up at a college dorm room with beer... and cookies.  Interviewing starts tomorrow. Wish me luck. I might stick around afterwards on Tuesday evening to go see Spider-Man 2 at midnight, tickets permitting. Review here if I do.
