A lot.   long telephone chats, even if stupid cell phones turn them into a lot of, "what? i couldn't hear that"   Airport greetings   email flirting   IM   stare wistfully out the window   calculate exactly how many hours I need to work in order to buy a plane ticket to Boston   save things to tell her later   write actual letters with actual ink and paper   did I mention airport greetings?
