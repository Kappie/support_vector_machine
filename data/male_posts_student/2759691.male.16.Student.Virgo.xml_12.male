"[I was seduced] with a bacon-wraaped cheeseburger," Gorran explained. He says his cholestrol went from 146 to over 200 while he was on the diet. "I came very close to dying, and this is from a diet I thought was marvelous,‚Äù said Gorran. When interviewed on FOX News, Gorran was obviously not asked fair questions and the host seemed to have an opinion before he even listened to Gorran. Gorran could be seen whispering "son of a bitch" after being interviewed.  FOX News has not commented on this "fair and balanced" piece of journalism. "FOX certainly makes its guests feel welcomed," joked one reporter. "I saw the interview," said another reporter, "and, boy, he doesn't look fat at all." However, popular Oprah-impersonator Dr. Phil told his audience that people who diet are "cowards" and that the only way to loose weight was to take the "weight loss challenge," while subjucting oneself to severe phycological analysis on national television. Dr. Phil refused to comment on his own weight. The Atkins Empire has not commented yet.
