Translate it near correctly, you'll come up with Lymphatic Ninjutsu. What that is, is about everything of mine. One of the very few things I actually will put my complete time, and effort into. It's actual perpose would be what you would call a Portal. I'm using it as the full name of my work. I'm estimating I'm going to have atleast 2 things up on there, by the end of next year. There is one thing, that's been on my nerves more than about anything. It's about Irshad and I. People think we are still going against each other, when we actually don't peak into each others business. Sure, he shows me his site and all, but I'm not worrying about it. I'm far from Irshads work. He's working for fun, I'm working for the rest of my life.  The project line of Lymphatic Ninjutsu ( aka LN ) would be ( for now), Hue, Namida Kanashimi. Hue, is going to be my highschool-college work. It will cover my art, language, and writing classes. Hopefully. I'm also going to do my best into making it into true manga format, for I am aiming to become Manga-ka in the near future. Is it possible? Maybe. Japanese are strick into what is theres. Unlike us Americans, they have something that they own of their own culture. America doesn't have a list of code, history, and work built into itself to be considered American. Sure, we have a lot of things, but not as big as theirs. If a caucasian woman can become Geisha, I could become Manga-ka by having almost any Japanese in my blood.  On the art format. I will try drawing with Japanese style, as in ink. If my Japanese is good enough by then, I will try to write in Kana, instead of English. I'll make a translated version, of course. I've also changed my art style, I used to draw in a sketch-ish way. I've changed my eye style,  my clothing, and my characters attitude. The plotline of Hue will continue changing untill' I am ready to work on it. Don't expect me to put a deadline on such important work, that would be stupid. I work with the wind, and do it with perfection.  For other news, I've had a couple changes on myself. Straightend my hair out, now it's much lighter and comfortable. I've also taken playing the drums into high consideration. I haven't forgotten about the whole DJ thing, I got many years ahead of me to put that into impliment. I've also started Highschool, which is a big move for me. I'm a bit nervous, it's not a problem though.You make friends along the way, I'm sure it will go great. I'm planning on flying to Reno this winter, visiting Jim, Reid, and Rani ( if he clears his act up ). Spend a week over there or something, just to see the snow and remember the good times. Snow, does amazing things.  Ja~
