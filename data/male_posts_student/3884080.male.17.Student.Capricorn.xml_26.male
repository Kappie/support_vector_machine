Rock Against Bush vol. 2 and Halfwayhome. The new rock against bush features bands such as: Green Day, The Unseen, The International Noise Conspiracy, The Casualties, Flogging Molly, The Lawrence Arms and many many more. The Dvd included with the cd includes music videos from Alkaline Trio, Bad Religon, NOFX, and Thought Riot. its got comedy from Will Ferell and Greg Proobs and Patton Oswalt. Go get it!  The other cd i got is Halfwayhome. ive never heard of them before but the thing that sucked me into buying them was on the cover of the cd was a sticker that said "If you are a fan of Thrice, Taking Back Sunday, and Saves The Day then buy this cd!" so i bought it. and oh my god, the cd is amazing! the songs are awesome, the lyrics are awesome, and the sound is awesome. it was also only $10.47 so i suggest everyone go out and buy it..............NOW!  summer is almost over, school starts septemeber 1st. Soccer starts next monday (the 16th), two practices everyday one 8-11 and the other one 1-3........im going to die. just like every other year. then after soccer is done (the whole season in general) im just going to walk around school the rest of the year like i have done for every other school year. And this is my senior year so after this one is done im going to have to walk around janesville. haha. janesville sucks. im just rambling now. so im going to go bye
