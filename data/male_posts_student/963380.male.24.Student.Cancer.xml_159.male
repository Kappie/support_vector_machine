Two of them, the Maxidex (shake before using, use every waking hour of the first day and four times a day for the following three days) and the Ciloxin, (use twice today, dinner and bedtime and four times a day for the next three days brekky, lunch, din din and sleepybyes.) sting around what must be the edge of the incision when applied. It stings only for a second and considering that these are the anti-inflamatories and the anti-biotics, it's slightly reassuring that they do. The Bion Tears (the lubircant) I'm hitting on a regular basis - 2-4 times an hour, depending on how I feel. Apparently those who moisten their eyes more promote the best healing. I want to be a best healing promoter(tm) so that's what I'm going to do.  I have a followup in the morning with Dr. Alfano - hopefully he tells me that I'm doing fine. At some point tonight I get to "Raise Sheilds" and go all hands to battlestations with the plastic guards I get to tape on to my face. These things are the rule, not the exception, for the next week. Seems a small price to pay. So tape away I shall.  Doing well so far.  Mom brought me fruit in a little cup with cool whip. She roxx0rs.
