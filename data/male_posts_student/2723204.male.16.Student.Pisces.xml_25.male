Regarding my analogy on God, i don't intend to expand on that anytime soon lol, so everything regarding God will be shelved for now, and now I'm working on an essay about feminism, secular 20th-21st century feminism. Cos' really, feminism really started my drive for knowledge and my interest in debate. So i'll get started on that. Actually, i've been conversing with a guy on the net, he set up an anti-feminist website and i went to initiate a debate via e-mail in the form of essays and counter-argument, i submitted my last counter-argument, he has not replied since........:P.........  But aside that, here's something more about what happened.......  I was at my auntie's house yesterday, lowing yu sang,but that's when i managed to improvise on the piano ! My piano teacher has been telling me that i'm now in a stage of my playing where my skills are basically stuck in a rut, and I need a breakthrough moment. And the moment was yesterday..........lol. I used the G and C harmonic minor for the melody and used 5th triads for accompaniment, cos' fifths have no thirds so, they can be used in both the major and minor context. (alright, if you can't understand music, i think i better shut the heck up....)  I was in the mood for talking, I haven't been REALLY talking on MSN for a long time, so i talked to XY and Ben, not bad though, haven't had a good conversation in a long time, but lemme see, my mind is kinda in a whirl now, and lemme see what i should write about today............hmmm you'll see it in the next post.
