I instantly felt so unpatriotic the moment I stepped onto that big-ass plane from Guadalajara to Atlanta. I was in a sea of Americans. America, the land of bad manners, of unhelpful people, of greed and lost values. Visit a traditional country like Mexico, and you'll see what we're missing here in the states. Everyone was so friendly. Religion was actually a driving force in society. Martha told me I would grow from this trip, and she was absolutely right. Talk about stepping outside of your comfort zone and experiencing something different.  It's only been a day and I miss her... Tomorrow I'm picking her up at the airport. Hooray! Then we're going to get some food and some Axe for me, then I'm driving her back to the Sturgess' house.  And then school.... but I think I'm about ready to go back.  I love you Martha.
