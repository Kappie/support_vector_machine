Its something that I never had.  Call him at three am, wishing to be reassured. He'd love to, of course he would, Anything to get you in his bed.   Goodnight she said, Im gonna start a revolution And you can be the star(t) of it, its in my head.  Footprints, and fallen leaves; these are the kind of things lovers think of.  Backseats and motels; these are the places that theyve been.  You want none of these things, these are the things that make us weak.   There went the world Just one girl  Number One Fan, There Went the World
