He's still pitching a couple innings later, and I continue to pound my head on the desk. It's just terrible to watch. Even when they win.  Except Lew Ford. And Justin Morneau. Now those two, they are good to watch. The rest of 'em, not so much.  Does Matthew LeCroy ever do anything other than strike out? I think I remember him once hitting a home run or two, but it's all so blurry now...
