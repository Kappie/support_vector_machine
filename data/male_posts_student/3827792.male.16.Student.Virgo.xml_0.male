Hope I do win the game though. Lots of stress coz my teacher reali hoping that my class smart alec and me will win the game coz we are suppose to be the best in the class so far. But still I got saboh into playing the thing. But at least I have stage experience so should not be a huge problem regarding stage fright. Been seeing more audience than that so wont fighten me. Hm..., I also damn happy coz finally got a new hp after two yrs. Somemore is the hp i wanted, so well, spirit been kinda high. Well, dunno wat else to say, so shall juz end here till next time!!.
