This morning I made coffee, and I already feel better.  I am trying to break my dependence on coffee, so I would welcome any suggestions from my educated readers.  And since today's blog is on the random side, I would also like to inform everyone that today is  laundry day .  This one of the few times when you call something "______ day," and it's not particularly exciting.  Some might even say it is postively mundane.
