Also note these blogs that have stuff about the bomb threat: Chad Brandos >  urlLink Waffles of Thought  Zach Loder >  urlLink Trekkies Have No Sanctuary  Sarah Freund >  urlLink crayZchicken2003    1:14 P.M. 5th Period: Band room --   Im sitting there trying to keep my sanity with some lame excuse for music... wait...dont you think that is a little harsh??? ... FINE! The music is okay, just we play it over and over again. Point being...Im ready to leave. Im jonesing to get out of the dang school. Im dreading to take a test 7th period in Spanish II because I already failed the chemistry test a couple days ago with a cool 59%...anyways...Im sidebarring. Then over the intercom, the coolest of the secretaries, Billie, says, "Teachers please evacuate your students to the softball or baseball diamonds immediately!" I think Ms. Feekes thought it was a joke...but did as she was instructed.   1:30 P.M. 6th Period: New softball diamond --  Maybe getting out of school was kind of cool, but why the heck were we outside!!! I was snooping around listening to the teachers talk and Mr. Johnson (who is very non-chalant) says, "Hey hey hey...bomb threat!" So the word spread quicker than a hookers....nevermind....anyways   1:45 P.M. 6th Period: New softball diamond --  Once again Im in the same spot. I look out into the parking lot. I think there were 3 or 4 cop cars. Oh our donut patrol members are so smart...NOT! The one guy (not gonna say a name) looked like he was half drunk....stuttering to someone on a cell phone he borrowed, "Uh...yeah...we got them out of the school...and...uhhmmm...there...uh...so far its good...nothing big...there was a bomb threat...uh..." I was just like WHAT THE HECK! This is STUPID...so I went and sat by some of my friends, Tom, Shorty, Beth, Megan, and some other people that are just too numerous to mention. Bored our of our minds Dan and I tried to color my hair with a window marker (ya know...the ones they use for homecoming on everyones windows)  Did it work???  Sure I guess...   2:00 P.M. 6th Period: Walking from place to place --  I got bored, so I decided to walk to the football field. None of us were allowed to leave...and my keys, billfold, books were in the school...so I took a little walk. I talked to cooper and her gang of friends. Then went and talk to Fischer and his friends. Then went and talked to Lexi and her friends (kinda talked...more like felt out of place...didn't say anything so I left) I went over to the baseball field next and there were all the juniors that are funny as crap. They somehow got ahold of a permanent marker and wrote "Survivor of the Bomb Threat '04" etc. etc.  Then Randy Krecklow whistles and tries to get our attention...I thought we were going back into the school...which I didn't want to do. Some people heard him some didn't. So all the teachers are whistling loudly to get everyones attention. Mr. Orr (one of the funniest teachers) whistles rather softly, because he cant whistle that loud, and says, "come on folks" Mr. Orr...quite entertaining :)   2:10 P.M. 6th Period: Walking to the Church --  It just so happened that we weren't going to the school again...we were going across the highway (that the police had blocked off) to Our Saviors Lutheran Church. There we would be a safe distance from the stupid high school. We sat inside until a table got broke, then we went outside. Todd (our stupid and slightly bald Vice Principal) Havel was trying to announce that there was going to be a bomb dog on its way from over 2 hours away. **GROAN!!** So that meant that our car keys were in the school, our car keys were going to stay in the school and there was no way were were going to get them out of the school. Oh well..,  My sister showed up at about 2:50 and took me home. She was on a school art show (just like  urlLink Chad ) and just showed up with everything being new to her. The stupid dog hadn't come yet...so we went home. Then my mom gave me some spare keys and took me to get my car. I went up to the church after that at about 5:30 P.M. and saw that the school was open. the bomb threat was over!!!  BIG FRICKING DEAL!!   Now I look back the waste of a day and wonder how classes are going to go over tomorrow...or who the dillhole was that called in the stupid threat. I highly suggest you read these blogs to get other peoples points of view on the topic...
