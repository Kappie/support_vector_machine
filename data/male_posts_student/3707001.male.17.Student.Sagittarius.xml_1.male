After gettin my grad ring, i went wit my parents to see our future house. (we move in sept, i'll miss u paradice)  It's finally starting to look like a home, we have walls and that pink insulation thingy.  I saw my future room, looks kinda small but im sure it'll seem huge when i move in and i stop sharing a room wit my annoying little bro.  Im confident that i'll do more homework next year than this year just cuz i'll have a REAL study space now... this year i did all my homework on my bed >.  After that it was off to youth group where i joined in fellowship with my beloved BASICs... (thx for making me come Martha) It was the first wednesday for about 2 years that i went to, and alota things have changed.  They actually have all the songs in powerpoint or something and Scotty and Hans led the worship.  But the real fun part was spending time wit Matt, Martha and Ada afterwards when we were SUPPOSED to be helping Ada wit her letter... but me and Matt just talked about our video games... (sorry...).  Well, it was mostly me talking to Matt, SOMEONE who invited me didnt say a word to me... :P Afterwards, Mike said that i could get a ride wit help, and i reluctantly accepted.  What i didnt know is that their ride as already full and that he offered me the ride out of the goodness of his heart... had i known that i would've called my parents or taken the bus... but anyways, Me, scott, hans, brent, jordan, mike, trish, devon, luke (?), and the driver Pastor McNeil all fit into one van.  Devon had to sit on the floor and the whole time i kept on thinking that i took her seat and felt really guilty.  But finally i got home, ate something, talked to ppl on msn and went to sleep.  I woke up this morning and did the usual, turned on the comp.  I signed into msn and saw Jessica online.  After exchanging some words, we discovered that we shared a few friends: Will and Ada from ETCBC!!! What a small world!!! Anyways, she promised that she would come wit me sometime to something... funny cuz ppl make me promise them the same thing... It's always good to find out that there are more believers out there than u thought.  Tho i wish i found out earlier :(  I also had to select courses for UTSC today.  And after alot of confusion and research, i discovered that my university plan was ruined cuz they didnt offer an important course to me until spring session ( 1st term: Bio, chem, calc, comp sci, and linguistics 2nd term: more bio, more chem, more calc, more comp sci, and algebra :D  Today is also the first time that many of my friends are reaching ball at paradice... so far its me, simey, caspy, koo, janis, AP, and nick.  Sadly, i'll have to leave the court earlier than i would have liked to cuz i gotta go to work.  I have also discovered that my manager is closing tonite >.  ps. Anyone know good Rap/R songs? my list is straining :(
