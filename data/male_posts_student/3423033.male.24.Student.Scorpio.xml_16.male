Big Mike wants me to hang in the poco for a month, but I just don't know about that. It might be good though as we can train together. That would get me into shape fast training with him.   Went on senior crawl last night, and one of Cory's classmates was looking pretty good. She was alright, nice booty on her. What a waste and a little cock tease she turned out to be. And she had a boyfriend! Some idiot she's with out of an obligation because he was there for her when she had cancer. Let me tell ya something honey, if you are staying with a cat out of obligation, and go out grabbing my dick in the club, you got yourself some problems and you better be getting the HELL out of that relationship.  I caved and let Janelle visit yesterday. I hate the fact she's so hot and I get along with her so well, but the shit wouldn't work out.... Damn her straight to hell. Straight to hell!!! She had some cool video tapes from her travels though. Looked like a lot of fun. I also got to hear some new music. Gnarly.  Alright, I'm going to bed now. Monday is the start of a new time in life. Maybe in NC. Maybe in NY. Maybe in ROOTSTOWN. We'll just wait and see.
