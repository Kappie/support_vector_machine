So here's how the day unfolded.  1st period there was a test and it was really stupid cuz the dumb teacher put a problem on there that was pretty much impossible.  Tyke talked to others in the class and they said the exact same thing as him.  They knew how to do the problem that was like the one on the test but the one on the test was made so that it was pretty much impossible.  It was just really gay.  2nd period was cool cuz Tyke found out he has a new student in there.  He won't name him yet cuz if you only get mentioned once then there isn't much reason to have a name for you.  But Tyke didn't really work out much other than having a mini-competition on who could bench the bar the most times.  It is pretty tough to do for a long time.  The bar doesn't seem heavy but the arms get so tired that they can't go up anymore.  That is when you stop.  3rd period was a total change from what was supposed to happen.  It was supposed to be a party-atmosphere but it sucked.  They ended up watching more of a stupid movie and Tyke and Purdy definitely weren't happy.  4th period was easy.  Talked about something.  Tyke doesn't actually remember what it was.  But they had 2 sing-a-grams and then also they listened to a few more songs, including Doc P's.  Lunch was fun; went to Costco for it to save some money.  Good hot dog today.  And the warm sun was very nice on Tyke's neck.  Very nice.  5th period was fun.  Just cuz of Tyke's little mini-escapade.  Tyke went on his usual bathroom trip past Skippy's class and talked to him for a little bit.  That was cool, then he went to the bathroom.  He walked around a little and said hi to some people and then he saw Shawna.  So he said hi to her and walked and talked with her.  Then she said she needed to find Tina and another girl to have a picture taken.  Well of course Tyke knows what class they have because he is always out during 5th period so he sees where everyone is.  So he went and they got Tina out of class.  They walked over to the Yearbook room and stood around.  Tyke was going to take the place of the other girl in the picture.  But they ended up not taking the picture :(.  It sucked!  So Tyke had to settle with just talking a little more and then leaving for his class.  It turned out that Macaroon needed to go to the bathroom the whole time Tyke was on his journey.  Whoops!  Oh well.  6th period was fun.  Tyke popped out some more accents and read from the Physics textbook.  His funny voices were adored.  Anyways, after school Tyke said goodbye to Purdy for a week and then the gang headed up to Tyke's to play bball.  It was a lot of fun this time.  They played at this court kinda by Tyke's house and it was really weird.  It was a nice little place but the backboard had no backboard.  It was missing the glass.  So the ball could go through the "backboard."  That caused some trouble.  The team of Tyke and Big Twigg lost the first game to the 3 undersized players but then won the next two thanks to Tyke's inside dominance and driving abilities...not his outside shooting.  He also drained his free throws, which came in handy the next games.  They played some 21 and Tyke won every time.  Then they played bounce 21 and Doc P managed to win that Tyke believes.  Whoa, he actually forgot.  But Tyke did dominate.  Actually Tyke might have won that game, shoot he doesn't remember.  Oh well, then they played a game of T-I-G.  Doc P shot the gayest shots ever.  One hand, no jump shots from everywhere.  He wouldn't stop.  Tyke hit a few but couldn't hit them with the insane luck that Doc P had so he ended up being the first out.  So then they went home.  And at 6:30 Tyke met up with Macaroon and Dr. Phil at Subway and they had a great dinner.  Then they went into GI Joes before going to Dr. Phil's work.  The manager guy kept following them around at GI Joes.  It was super stupid of him.  First he told them they couldn't "use the frisbees inside."  How dumb is that?  They couldn't toss them 2 feet (literally 2 feet) to test them out???  Reaaaal gay.  Anyway, to make a long story short...Tyke, Macaroon, and Kinker hung out at Tyke's.  They played some games and then Dr. Phil came over after work and he joined the festivities.  It was a gay ol night of fun.  Tomorrow (today should be fun too).  The girls should win.  Tyke, the number one fan will be there for sure.  But he will be sleeping through the boys game.  No doubt about that :)!!!
