After shopping around for a good part of the summer I finally decided on an  urlLink Apple Powerbook  just like  urlLink Jen's .  I bought the Powerbook from the Apple website on Friday. When I got home I was welcomed by a call from Visa who had blocked payment for this expensive item that Kevin could not possibly have bought.  After reassuring Visa that I had indeed purchased the item I had to call Apple customer support and tell them to charge my card again. As I sat on hold listening to the latest single from the Black Eyed Pea's I began to appreciate how much work Apple puts into projecting their brand as a young and hip.
