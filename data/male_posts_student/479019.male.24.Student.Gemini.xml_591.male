Self-Conciousness is somewhere in the middle? Marx is better, but still not fun.  Elena's theory on that is that Germany isn't nearly as nice as France and Italy where philsophers sit around in the Riviera with wine or coffee. So in their bitterness they write difficult stuff, unlike their smooth and eloquent counterparts to the south. Umberto Eco and Italo Calvino were good.  I'm tired...  **
