E . How many people do u know that go around sniffing other guys to "test " how tough they r. I really wish i were exaggerating in saying so. and another thing. why would anyone go up to people saying: wat .......u want to spank me dontcha.. yeah u know u do. just like watt i did to jo mama last evening." it was bad enough that they didnt have the guts to insult me directly. But if ur gonna talk wannabe street, at least have the decency to end ur sentences like that. wat idiot goes around saying " last evening" how disgusting is that. then they all say ' yo lets go jack off each other" i really hope they dont know what jack-off each other means. if they do ...im afraid off wat will happen to America's future if they're it. I have plenty more things to say about these kids, but I'm not sure most of u are ready to hear this, yet.
