I hope it works out like this all the time.  8 games up and I hope the Card's don't let up now.   "Cardinals pitchers have allowed three or fewer runs in 14 of the past 15 games. Five relievers combined on hitless relief the final three innings. Isringhausen got five outs for his 21st save in 25 chances. The bullpen has allowed two earned runs in the last 29 innings."
