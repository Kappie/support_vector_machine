Well his idea was that we would have to get up into theattic and cut and install 2X4's to mount the fan mount to, but, me being the incredible thinker that I am ;), hah, decided that if we just found longer screws we could modify the fan enough to mount it to the fan mount that we had already, so he went out to his shed and found some, took about 3 trips but he finally found some and so I checked it to see if it would fit, and it would, the only problem was that the ring to cover the screws at the top wouldn't fit if we did it my way, so he took the fan out to the garage and drilled some new holes, and we got it in nice and neat, I was pretty happy with it, it was uneven at first but I was happy that just a few hits and turns got it to slip into place and sit right...well I made $10 for 3 hours of work, I wasn't really expecting to get anything so I was pretty happy about that...then my grandma and sister had left and took their newer car (which is extremely nice and great to drive by the way), so I was left taking my grandpa's old beater home, fuckin gas pedal was all ghetto and there really isnt a muffler left, its just sort of a rusted out box now, but it was fun, the steering wheel was huge so i felt so weird driving it but I got us to my house safe and sound, pretty fast too actually =), and thats what really matters, right? hah, of course not, who cares how safe we get there, all that matters is that we make it in less time than we have in the past! But now I'm gonna go so I can take the dog out...
