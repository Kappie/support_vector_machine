It's totally bad ass. I don't think that I could be happier in any other car.    As far as work went, today was pretty good. I went to Chadron Dental right away, and got a whole bunch of stuff taken care of for them. I was there from 11 till 2:30, and I took an hour lunch after that. From 3:30 to 5 I just cleaned up the office mostly. It looks 10 times better now, actually presentable to customers. We're a little backed up so I probably should have been working on computers, but it was turning into a zoo up there. Plus my co-workers are slow and very very messy. I don't know how much longer I'm going to stay at that job. The stress is killing me.    Looks like I've finally got my server up and running. I haven't gotten to actually running the server yet, but I'm optimistic. I'm getting all the windows updates and drivers right now. Hopefully it will be broadcasting over the net by midnight. I'll keep you posted on what's happening. Sayonara!
