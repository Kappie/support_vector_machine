Yes Ladies and Gents, believe it or not after years of deliberations and months of haggling with exun bureaucracy (our hon'able head of programming), I am finally here.   They have us going to this cyberfest thingy. We need someone for linux programming and up until now, all the presidents are in agreement. We don't have a linux programmer. So if anyone has any secret skills with linux, you will please disclose them now. Better yet, talk to Rungta (you know, the H.O.P.). Oh and Karan, if you read this, why don't you put up who is doing what (who goes for what event)  up here, God knows this blog needs purpose.  --Bloodfist out.
