The crowd was one of the best crowds I've seen in a while. You had people moshing to the opening band, the God Awfuls, and people going the whole night. They played a variety of stuff from really new to somewhat older. I don't think they ever play really old stuff anymore, but they were playing stuff from the mid-90s which is good. Does Warren always have to show his ass? They closed with "I Have A Date."  ****
