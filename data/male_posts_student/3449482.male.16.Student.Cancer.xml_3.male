I, myself can tel tat i hav changed alot even some broths and sis R saying it but i myself kno tat wat i had done is very NOT enough... I MUST continue to change in the gd way... 2day after hearing Wei Kit's sharing i found tat i like nv care or get to kno more abt my brothes and sisters i keep saying i'm a failure... But i really thank's God for all his forgiveness, even though i had done so many bad  things God still forgive me and let me stand up again... Thank's God! Tis verse is for all the sad and moody ppl - 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18  16 Be joyful always; 17 pray continually; 18 give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.  I donno wat to write here but i hope all of U remember all these.... Be helpful, caring, kind, generous, forgiving, thanksful, initiative, focus in God's thing, sensetive to others ppl feeling and discipline... don forget to always pray for others and oso do ur Q.T! If U R lonely or wat, remember God is always everywhere for U all and i will be always there for U all... Gd luck and God Bless... ByE!
