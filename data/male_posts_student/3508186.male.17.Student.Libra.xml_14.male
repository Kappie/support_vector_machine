I do have responsibilities, and more may have been added, but I feel I can tackle them even better now.    I now know the new has past problems that are very important and stressful.  I can help make it past the obstacles and help clear anything away.  At least I hope I can.  Only time will tell, only hearts will prosper, only minds will be challenged.
