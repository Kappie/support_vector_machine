There were just too many times people have tried to look inside of me Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away Afraid to say what was on my mind Afraid to say what I need to say Too many things that you say about me when I’m not around You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down But i've had too many stand-offs with you, its about as much as I can stand So I’ll wait until the upper hand is mine  One minute your on top The next your not, watch it drop Making your heart stop Just before you hit the floor One minute your on top The next your not, missed your shot Making your heart stop You think you've won And then it's all gone  So many people like me that put so much trust in all your lies So concerned of what you think, to just say what we feel inside So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long All I know is that all I want is to feel like i'm not stepped on There are so many things you say that make me feel you've cross the line What goes up will surely fall, and i'm counting down the time Cause i've had so many stand-offs with you, its about as much as I can stand So i'm waiting until the upper hand is mine  One minute your on top The next your not, watch it drop Making your heart stop Just before you hit the floor One minute your on top The next your not, missed your shot Making your heart stop You think you've won And then it's all gone And then it’s all gone And then it’s all gone And then it’s all gone Now it’s all gone   I know i'll never trust a single thing you say You knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway And all the lies have got you floating up above us all But what goes up has got to fall   One minute your on top The next your not, watch it drop Making your heart stop Just before you hit the floor One minute your on top The next your not, missed your shot Making your heart stop You think you've won And then it's all gone And then it’s all gone And then it’s all gone And then it’s all gone Now it’s all gone  HA   goodnight funky-t
