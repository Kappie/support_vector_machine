The first sample sent chills up my spine. Does that not sound like Chrono Trigger or Xenogears with a little of the crystal theme tossed in? This is definitely my favorite of the three.  The second track has a distinct Final Fantasy Tactics feel. Beautiful. All those memories of the first FFT... wow, what an amazing game.  The third had some parts that reminded me of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. The lower beats in it kind of made me think of the Bangaa.  This Final Fantasy may very well be the best one yet. With a revamped (and seemingly vastly improved) battle system and a storyline tying into the Tactics' Ivalice, this game will undoubtedly be outstanding. Phenomenal. The story... man, even the music is giving me chills already.  It's been promised to be the best looking Ps2 game ever. Heh. Doesn't look that way from the screenshots. But hey, as long as it's more consistent than FFX, I'll be happy. Besides, Final Fantasy's biggest draws for me have always been style, sound, and story. And man, it has always delivered.  With Yasumi Matsuno at the reigns and Hideo Minaba, Akihiko Yoshida, Isamu Kamikokuryu, and Nobuo Uemetsu backing him, this game may be one of the greatest tales ever.  urlLink  More info, for anyone interested.
