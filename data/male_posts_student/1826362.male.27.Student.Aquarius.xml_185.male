I know that nonprofits are less dressy than profits, so decided to go without the suit, and wear a shirt and tie instead (yes, Shukie, i was wearing pants too).  But oops! in my haste packing for my trip here from Philly, i forgot to pack ties.  I'll stop in at the gap and get a tie on my way.   -Do you sell ties. -No, I don't.  Try Urban Outfitters. so i figured, I'd just go without the tie.  When I got off the bus, I realized that my chronic paranoia about being late for anything had made me almost an hour early for this interview.  And that the bus let me off directly accross from the Big K Mart at the Brighton Mills mall.  Ah!  They must sell ties there. Belts. Suspenders. Wallets. Silk Boxers. no ties.   -Excuse me, do you have any men's ties in stock? -yes. -do you know where they are located? -in the men's section. -but do you know where in the section; i couldn't find them. -did you look in the corner, by the belts? -yes. -then we must not have any in stock. -thank you, you've been very unhelpful.
