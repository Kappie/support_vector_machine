The sad thing is that the registrar just was just lazy and wasn't using an optimal way to organize the schedules. Any way I have begun the string-pulling process. My dad suggested I list why I want to be in both classes so here goes:  Why I want to be in Cho-op:   To continue my New Trier Choral Experience  To be in The Cho-op Musical  Because my mom was in Cho-op  To fulfill the requirement for Swing Choir of having another choir  To learn about American Musical Theatre (That's what the book says...)  I have friends in the class  To have taken every choir available to my by junior year (except Choraliers)   Why I want to be in AP Latin 4:   To continue my Classical Studies at New Trier  I may well at least start college majoring in Classics  To take the AP Latin-Vergil Exam  Because I have invested five years into learning latin already, and need a year complete my knowledge of Latin to a sufficient plateau.  So I can take AP Latin 5 next year  'Cause Vergil's Aeneid is a Classic, and reading part of it in the original Latin would be amazing  I have friends who take Latin  I rock at Latin (if I do say so myself) and while I my be very advanced for my years, I still find it one of my most challenging classes.   If you notice some amount of correlation, it is because I tried to do that.  So some options for me to resolve this schedule conflict are as follows:   Drop one or the other class (Very Undesirable, for Cho-op I would have to pick up another chorus to stay in swing choir, preferably Concert Choir)  Be allowed to participate in the Cho-op musical without being in the class and skirt the Swing Choir requirement.  Do some indepent study for Latin to continue as though I were in the class.  Take AP latin 5 before AP Latin 4 (AP-wise very viable, NTHS-wise, maybe not...)  Take nine level Latin 4 (Very undesirable, for then I would not be able to take AP latin 5)   Well dinner is now, so I have to go, but more on this later
