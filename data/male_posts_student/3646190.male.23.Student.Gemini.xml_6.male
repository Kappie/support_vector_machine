One of those moments came at my job, where I sat down with two kids--a boy and a girl--who could barely speak English. We worked diligently for two hours on English.   Working with the two kids brought feelings inside of me that have been dormant for a while. I looked at each one of those kids with such care and affection as they tried so hard to learn this new language. They would both comment occasionally in their native tongue-Arabic...  I had a glimpse--a window--into what it means to be a loving teacher who wants the best for all the students that walk through his classrooms. The last time I felt that was probably when I was pre-student teaching in Dearborn. For some reason, I really enjoy working with Muslim students. I can't explain why, but it something I am sure will be bubbling in my thoughts for a while. I left work yesterday with the biggest grin and brightest of hopes.
