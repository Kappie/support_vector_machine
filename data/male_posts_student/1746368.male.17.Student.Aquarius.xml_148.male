I just finished Day 10 of my Setting Captives Free course (see below: "Feeling: Eh, alright I guess") and I feel different. It was about grace and how we don't deserve it, yet we get it anyways. The course showed how I could recieve grace and what steps to take to recieve it. I am now on my way to living right again with God. I know that this has not been an easy thing for me or for my friends, but I thank all of you for your support. I will be posting a bit longer of a post when I finish all of my homework.   Catch you cool cats on the flipside (okay, I will NEVER say that again)  "It's amazing the clarity that comes with psychotic jealousy." --My Best Friend's Wedding--Never saw it, but found that quote and thought it was funny.
