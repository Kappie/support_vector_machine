Stuff love and hate, the most important human emotion is greed, or personal want. This drives every thing. Every other emotion we expreience stems from this: Love - want of someone, Hate - want of something negative to happen to someone or something, jealousy - want of someone elses things.

Each action we make on a day to day basis is decided by what we, at that time, as a human being, want to do to make us feel right. No one has ever done ANYTHING solely for someone else. There is always a payoff, even if it is only feeling good about ourselves, that we factor into the equation of deciding what to do. The result of the event might be more negative than the result of another choice we could have made, but no one has ever made a descision based entirely on someone elses want. How coudl they, as part of doing that is to want to do something for someone else, therefore making you feel better.

No matter how charitable you are, there is no choice you make, no action you take, that has not taken into account, in however small part, your own feelings and wants.

Thus, each and every single one of us is greedy, its just a matter of degree.
