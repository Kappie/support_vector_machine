People never ask what's in it, but when you get it you can't really tell because everything is covered by the thick white sauce (I assume this makes up the "chowder"). There could be hunks of plastic or phlegm or anthrax for all you know, and everything would taste the same due to the sauce. I asked a few people on MSN to see what they thought was in clam chowder. Observe.  streak [ pert ] says:     what's in clam chowder? sans everything - allchris.blogspot.com says:     clams? streak [ pert ] says:     hmm  streak [ pert ] says:     what's in clam chowder? .loves printer for not dying on me. says:     lobster, clam, and other fishes  streak [ pert ] says:     what's in clam chowder? kayyyla says:     clams  As you can see, three out of three people all thought (nay, ASSUMED) clam chowder contained clams.

I suspect that every bowl of chowder is a potential biological weapon manufactured primarily for high-risk guerilla warfare against your stomach. We might not be able to save everyone from this deadly game of Russian roulette, but for your sake, next time someone serves you clam chowder, ask "WHAT'S IN THIS?" and make a huge scene. Your kids will thank me later.
