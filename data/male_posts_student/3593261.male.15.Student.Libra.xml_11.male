I knew it...she must be up to something, probably a plot beyond devastation...she's probably trying to get hold of me...trying to choke me to death if I don't have A1...use a samurai sword and cut my head as if it was a watermelon...but one thing's for sure...I know my standard well...I knew that a pathetic wretch like me aren't good in sissy subject like MT....so, sorry teacher, your time is up...Just don't underestimate me...Don't think I am that pathetic... =P  Oh yeah, A.Maths was very interesting..I loved it...the Trigonometric functions was damn easy..she taught us fast and with efficiency..what a great teacher..with more practice, I hope I can do well for A.Maths. Oh yah...Geography lesson wasn't bad either..it was very interesting..especially with Mr.Bay around...I got to know more about Geography...haha...thanks Mr.Bay =)
