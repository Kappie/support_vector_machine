Thanks for all your words of caring,    It makes me feel the warmth in sharing.    Finally, my crystal has got back its shining,    Only some blue within that needs some healing.   If only I had done more readings,    Then I could do better on all the rhyming.   But this is just the beginning,    Iâ€™ll practice on it and get it going!~!~
