There were 5 slides:  Slide 1 -- a quote from an alumnus about how valuable working for a law firm is. Slide 2 -- % of graduates who go to work for law firms, public interest organizations, etc. Slide 3 -- average salary of graduates who go to work for law firms vs. public interest Slide 4 -- % of graduates who find jobs as compared with the national average.  Big surprises here. Slide 5 -- law firm retention rate after x years out of school.  My spoof coming by the middle of the week hopefully.  If I can find a way to attach a powerpoint file to the weblog, I'll do that.  Otherwise, you'll have to e-mail me for it.
