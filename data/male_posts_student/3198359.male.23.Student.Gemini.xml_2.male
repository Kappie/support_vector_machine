Just have a quick browser through  urlLink OS News  seems to be populated with the same anti-SUN whiners, whingers, complainers, oh, did I forget to mention, Linux fanboys. Everyone knows these sorts of people, they sit around hyperventilating over their operating system that they started using "exclusively" for 2 months! wow! A whole two months! And here is me, used Linux for 7 years, years before it became the darling of the media, IBM and every other parasitic clingon from the IT industry.  Then there are the so-called "pastors" and "ministers" who are equal to that of a Linux fanboy but instead hang around alt.politics.homosexuality. No study, no credibility but expecting to be taken seriously. The equivalence of them out in the real world would be an architect who has a great idea but doesn't have the necessary skills to make their "vision" possible. Call me old fashioned or elitist, but don't expect me to give you an respect as "minister" or "pastor" until such time you do the hard yards; until the day you do the "hard yards", you're like every other yobo out there with a chip on both sholders and a large soap box to match.  Well, I've got that morning rant out of the way ;-) lets hope the rest of the day works out nicely.  On some positive news,  urlLink Camino  has really stabilised. I've been running the nightlies for over a month and it has gone from strength to strength, however, at the same time, Firefox has made some real movement forward. About the only thing lacking from Firefox would be native widgets for webpages; the standard GTK/XUL looking ones are rather ugly when compared the gorgeous toned down "MacOS 10.3" aqua look 'n feel.
