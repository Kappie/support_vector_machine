His mom was home for the day so he ended up not being able to do much cuz he had to help her out some. He looked at a bunch of printers and multifunction printers and helped to make the decision that he is not going to buy a printer with his laptop. Instead, he will either take the one the family is using primarily right now (which is a good one) and his family will just upgrade to a printer/scanner/copier/fax machine, or he will buy one through a different company and it will be good but not that expensive. This took up most of the day. The rest of the time he was playing the piano, lifting weights, or eating. He didn't watch any tv until the Mariners game at night. In the early evening he and his mom went down to Kostko (Kinker should get it) and they looked at printers and some food items. Tyke thought about it and realized that Skippy might very well be working there at the moment so he walked around and sure enough the man was there. So they chatted for a minute and found out what they were up to and when they could hang out. Probably won't be for a while still but at least it is known now. After getting home Tyke put some more pressure on his parents to finally make their final inputs on his new laptop and they caved enough to help him out. So he told them what he wanted and all of that and they said what they thought was best and really didn't care at all what he was getting. The cost went up and up and nothing seemed to matter. When all was said and done it cost $2,139.21 (50 cent deduction on shipping!!!) and it will be really cool when it gets here. However, that isn't until like 2 weeks from now. That sucks. Tyke is excited for it but he is definitely not excited for 2 weeks to be over. That would mean he has less than 2 weeks left of summer which isn't a great thought at the moment. But really, the laptop's gonna be tight. Tyke even splurged and bought a $20 game. Hehe, it's a bunch of poker and card games. It better have Hold'Em though or else it will suck. But it's the 2004 version and Hold'Em is the game of 2004. No doubt. And Tyke is also the man of 2004. He just polled his downstairs and he was the hands down, unanimous decision. After Tyke's long time spent searching everything and it's mother on the laptop situation he came back downstairs and talked to Kinker. He decided what they were going to do tonight. Kinker came over and the two hung out. Just played cards really. Tyke taught Kinker 3 new games though and Kinker refreshed Tyke on Rummy which they had some dissension about but it all ended up coming out square. It was fun cuz after cards were over they talked about their childhoods and how cool they used to be. Tyke and Kinker are the new Tyke and Skippy. That may be harsh, but it's totally true. Especially cuz Tyke and Kinker are going to college together and have similar (sorta but not really) interests. And they have a mutual friend made already. Sure, Tyke hasn't ever met her but they've talked, through Kinker. And Tyke's gonna drive Kinker out to Marysville and they're gonna hang out with her. That's it. It's true. Well now Tyke is going to say that there isn't more to say about today. Tomorrow Tyke will be going to Children's Hospital (as a 17 year old) in order to get his deformed chest looked at again (by the way if you didn't know Tyke does actually have a deformed chest). So maybe he'll go do some more crunches to make himself look good for all of the babies and 2 year olds there ;). Oh wait, that's gross.
