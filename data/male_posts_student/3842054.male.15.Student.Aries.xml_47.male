It was the most amazing experience that ive had almost all summer (except seeing Daniel... ok, glad i said that, otherwise my head would be ripped off.)  There are so many lyrics and song titles i could use, that i just used the rock on symbol.  Alright, sorry i couldnt post last night, i fell asleep like right after i got home.  Ok, so now im going to summarize the Warped Experience for you by band and events of the day  Brittneys dad dropped us off there at 1:10. We walked like a block until we reached the ampithearte, where we were enjoyably patted down by some middle aged bald man. We got in and first we just stood there wondering what to do. All American Rejects were playing, and we went to look at the lineup, and then we went to get into the crowd to watch them. That got boring and Brittney, Ryan, and I left Emily with her boyfriend and we went to find Morgan and Becky. We met them in the actual ampithearte, and Morgans (I guess boyfriend) was there, his name was Steven, really cool kid. So then we wanted to go see Matchbook Romance, but we couldnt find them, and we walked behind the two main stages, the Brian and Teal stage. There was a lot going on. When we got back in the front of the stages, we had to wait for the Bouncing Souls to finish before Coheed and Cambria could start. I was getting really anxious cuz it was the hottest part of the day and i wanted to see Coheed quick so i could go get comfortable. So finally after lke 20 minutes, bouncing souls ended, and coheed came on. Of course, two minutes later, everyone was jumping and i was like suffocating, so i had to go cuz i thought i was gonna fall down. So we went and got water and went ot the side stage to see them perform "A favor house atlantic" and then we left. We went back into the ampitheartre and met back up with Morgan and everyone, and then we went down to eat some lunch. We saw Marcos which was cool and there was a really good band that we didnt know the name of, but i think it was Chronic Future. So we had hot dogs, and then we went to the entrance to meet Becca and Erin. Flogging Molly started playing and we could hear them and i started dancing. They werent bad, but i could only see myself listening to their cd like twice a year. We lost Becca and Erin shortly and then we went walking around the band tents. We went to Matchbook Romance, and it turned out they were in their tent! I got all of their autographs on my shoe, and they were telling me jokes. A little odd but totally cool. We then went to Coheed and Cambrias tent and inside was the lead singer. Morgan freaked otu and i got his autograph too. Then it started to pour. Everyone ran under a tree, excpet me who wanted to get wet. So then i told Ryan and Steven i wanted to go see a band in the rain. It was downpouring and we started runnig towards the teal stage. Taking Back Sunday was on and they were awesome. They finished shortly, and then the Vandels went on. They sucked. Then when NOFX was about to start, i decided i wanted the girls to see them too. So i went to go get them, and i see morgan and Becky running around panicked. THey lost Brittney. So now we run to the other guys and tell them that Becky and I will find brittney and come back. after like 15 minutes, we find Brittney and we just sint in the back and watch NOFX. Then Sugarcult came on. They were amazing. I knew almost all their songs, and it was still kinda raining so they were so proud that we were all still there rocking on. They are hopefully going to be back in a few months with Greenday. After sugarcult was Billy Talent and then Bad Religion. We went to find Morgan, Steven, and Becky, who left us, but we couldnt find them. So we waited by the lineup poster thing for an hour, watching the two bands, and like 2 minutes before story of the year started, they call us and tell us where they are. We find them and SOY starts. THEY WERE AWESOME. I was screaming and singing so loud i almost lost my voice. Anthem of our dying day, and Until the Day I die were amazing songs, and SOY were doing backflips, spinning their guitars around their necks, and jumping into the crowd to surf. Right after them was my favorite band, Yellowcard. I knew every word to every song and was jumping up and down. For like 2 songs i was in the middle of the crowd, and the rest we stood kinda in the back because of mosh pits and mud fights. Still awesome. Some guy grabbed my chest and started shaking me saying "This is a Yellowcard dude right here" He was drunk, but it was really funny. Finally, the last band was New Found Glory. They are from here, so that was pretty cool, but they were kind of disapointing. I really didnt like them, and i think that everyone was really tired so all the moshing and jumping kind of died down. The concert was over, but i was still buzzing, covered in dirt, and totally sore. We got into the car and went to McDonalds, french fries and ice cream, and then headed home. It was a great day, and i cant wait to do it the rest of my high school life and maybe more.  So that was on Saturday. Today is Monday, and my last post was on Thursday. Sorry about that, i just havent had a lot of time. Well, dont worry, nothing has happened. Ill update later tonight. Well, lyrics. and goodday for now.  Sugarcult Shes the Blade  Don't you make a move tonight You can only stagger Once shes got you in her sight You're the one shes after  Shes the blade and you're just paper You're afraid cause shes got closer You're back-steppin and back-stabbing everything in your life  She stole everything your heart desired Now you want it back She stole everything your heart desired Now you want it back  One by one you count the fights Doesn't even matter That shes got you by surprise Misery's your master  Shes the blade and you're just paper You're afraid cause shes got closer Your back-steppin and shes out wrecking everything in your life  She stole everything your heart desired Now you want it back She stole everything your heart desired Now you want it back  She stole everything She controlled everything  She stole everything She controlled everything  Shes the blade Shes the blade Shes the blade and you're the paper Shes the blade and you're just...  Shes the blade and you're just paper You're afraid cause shes got you closer  She stole everything your heart desired Now you want it back She stole everything your heart desired Now you want it back  She stole everything She controlled everything She stole everything And controlled everything   Morgan and Steven were making out the whole time. I didnt even know they were going out until Story of the Year played.    I love this song, and i was the only one that new all the lyrics at the concert. Im special.
