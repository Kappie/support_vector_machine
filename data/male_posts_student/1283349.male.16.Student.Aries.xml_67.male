Salvatore is a hack, or at least close to being one. His saving grace is that lots of things die in his books. I only buy them for the XPs in Brian's game. *such a WHORE!*) Book-- Greg Bear's  Infinity Concerto  Misc-- a little silver-covered journal Misc-- $2/gallon gas! Gah!  And I need to buy credits in Imperian, soon. And find a job, though I hate that.  Oh, speaking of jobs: Eric Clapton is coming to Dallas, and of course, like 50 other awesome musicians are travelling with him. It's another of those "Crossroads" tours, like the one he did in the 70s. BB King, Jeff Beck, Clapton, and a dozen other names that leapt out at me (that I forget now.) Why do I comment on this? Because I'm going? No. But I -am- going to be working a booth with Pat at the convention that is going to spring up behind the concert, like fungus springing up in the doo doo left by the passing of a cow. I'll never sneer at 10 bucks an hour.
