Good likelihood that I won't...that's just how things are.  At the same time, I'm not going to get $1,000,000 from Mark Cuban in Dallas.  But trips are nice.  And there's no way to get the money if I don't go.    What I'd need is a 9am wakeup (regardless), a look at the sky, and a decision.  If it's to Dallas to sit in a hotel lobby for four hours, waiting to pitch my reason why I'm worth a shitload of cash, that works.  If it's to get the laptop, work on the screenplay, and hopefully make some headway into the world of grantwriting and festival submission, that works too.  Whatever the case, I need to keep busy.    Would've been nice of me to get ahold of Harge and Nicole earlier than today...could've made a trip tonight for it and had a weekend in D-town.  But these are the transgressions that accompany grabass.  I'm looking at an EQ logon tonight to see if he's there, and if we'll get together after my soiree.  And to see if my account still works.    Chance that I'll have $3G saved after I graduate in May...that doesn't include the huge garage sale coming after the big day.  Not sure if the drums go out there...I'm making some good progress, as I've learned how the high-hat works.  It really requires a group to settle down with and practice usual beat patterns and get the muscle memory there.  That's a reason for finding a city.  Like I said, the minute I get an agent is the minute I feel no problem with settling my happy ass down.    Interesting fact -- the second most Billboard-successful music group after the Beatles?  Hall and Oates.  Hey, Christopher Cross was the most decorated first-time Grammy winner in history until Norah Jones took the honor last year.
