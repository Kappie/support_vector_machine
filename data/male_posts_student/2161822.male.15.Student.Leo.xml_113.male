Maybe it's due to my inability to complete the simplest of math equations. Oh well. So now I sit here in complete and utter boredom. Sunday's aren't really that great. They're still part of the much awaited and coveted weekend, but they just don't appeal to me. Maybe since I know in 24 hours I'll be sitting in an uncomfortable desk sweating to death listening to a whole mouthful of crap. Just the image in my head ruins the day. I'll try not to think about it again just because I might become nauseated. Such a shame that summer has to hide in school's buttcrack for so long. I wish it was here. I'm beginning to dread final exams. I don't even want to think about what the Chemistry exam will be like. Oh well. I'll wait to the very last moment possible to think about it.  I added a few things to this wonderful blog. Now you'll find a (drum roll please) wonderful clock located above Archives  just to let you know how much time you're wasting reading this pointless garbage. You'll also find some links to other sites you could possibly waste more time at. All of which receive my personal highest rating of 2 devil horns. Rock on. \m/ °_° \m/  Also, check out Ash's new blog. Uh, link is on the right, but for all you lazy folk, here it is:  urlLink Click here    Listen to H.I.M.
