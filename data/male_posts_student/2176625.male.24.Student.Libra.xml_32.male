Our flight was delayed 15 minutes due to bad weather. When we arrived in Sac it was mad windy and raining. Mal does not know my family and decided instead of staying at my house she will stay in a hotel. She rented a car and we were on our way. Mal found a salon in Laguna on the way n made an appointment for a whole beauty package tomorrow while I am with my mom.   I went to Avie's. We took Juniper (her dog) for a walk through the park when the weather cleared and took a quick walk to City College where I met her fiancee Bryant before his classes. My mom arrived later and we took a quick trip to Vic's (shiiiiit remember whan it used to be fucking Jumbo?).
