You said 'Victims of circumstances No freedom no choice no preference.' But who said so, who said so? Have you asked yourself Who gives the verdict so?  Prisoners of Azkaban please stop crying Cos the sentence says you're not dying Jus two years, two years ya hafta wait So there's really nothing to be afraid.  Let's not forget all the dementors No matter how you escape at all cause Not that Common? That's all false  They suck all the happiness Making much of you so lifeless Exposing all your weakness Making much of you so brainless All this more or less Due to much of you so careless  So now you've got to memorise Sine sine cosine pie Three point one four one five nine  You said 'Victims of circumstances No freedom no choice no preference.' But who said so, who said so? Have you asked yourself Who gives the verdict so?  Prisoners of Azkaban please stop crying Cos the sentence says you're not dying Jus two years, two years ya hafta wait So there's really nothing to be afraid.  Just let Lord be in your heart For He is the Alpha and the Omega For He will boost you spiritually For He will help you excessively For He is the one you'll lean on eventually  Prisoners of Azkaban please stop crying Cos the sentence says you're not dying Jus two years, two years ya hafta wait So there's really nothing to be afraid.    Alex written it for me....nice rite...it's so cool...
