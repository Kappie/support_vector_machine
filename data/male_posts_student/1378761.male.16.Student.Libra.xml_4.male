Went to the Library yesterday to get the Book "Rainbow Six" by Tom Clancy. It is a very good BUT very long book, totaling at 740 pages. It is a monster to carry around. I had to get a new library card, as I lost my old one when my wallet got lost. It is neat how you can request books online and pick them up at the library. It is one of the best features I can think of. I am going to read all of Tom Clancys books. He is one of my favorite authors.  Well school starts this THURSDAY. Bummer! I guess it is getting kinda boaring anyways. I guess I will have more free time at school to write HERE in my blog. For some reason they gave me study halls for 1st and 8th period. You are only allowed one. Someone must like me somewhere.   As you probley all ready noticed, I am a terriable speller. Thank God for Spell Checker in WORD!  That's it for now. Blog you later! //Eric\\
