This 50/50 group featured the  Germans ,  Czech Republic  and  Latvia . This group has great players, great talent and excellent skills...but being me, I only talk highly due to my international team being involved, the Dutch.      You can trust and pray all you like but it's only down to the players themselves how their outcome will be ! Knowing the Dutch I know that working together as a group they'll achieve what they set out for, the win, the skills or even just a good match (but we know everyone wants to win). Even though Holland will have a long way to succeed facing many teams, pressure and victories, they'll just have to do their best.     Sea Of Orange / Orange Tide          The 11 men who I think will succeed on this team are :    Goal Keeper  -  Edwin  van der Sar     Defence  -  Michael  Reiziger    Defence  -  Jaap  Stam    Defence  -  Frank  de Boer    Defence  -  Giovanni  van Bronckhorst      Midfield  -  Edgar  Davids    Midfield  -  Phillip  Cocu    Midfield  -  Clarence  Seedorf      Forward  -  Ruud  van Nistelrooij    Forward  -  Arjen  Robben    Forward  -  Roy  Makaay              I only mentioned these 11 as I think they'll be a great team but too I want the people I've not mentioned to do well aswell because everyone together makes a team ! Hopefully these guys will succeed and hopefully win and beat their group moving onto the quarter finals !   urlLink  Group info     Group Information is provided from Euro2004.com
