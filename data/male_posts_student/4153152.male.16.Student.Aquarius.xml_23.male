It was not efficient, but it was productive.  I was going to go in and do a little bit of work today. Simple in shop jobs, and backing things up off of my failing hard drive. Then comes a service call to check out some printing problems at the B Tax Office. I spent four hours working on this thing. It was a 367 Mhz Celeron with 256 RAM running Windows XP Pro. I wouldn't have minded it so much, but more than 75% of my time was spent waiting for it to do things. The icing on the cake, however, is that I had to constantly listen to three women gossiping while they sealed envelopes. All day.  As a side note, you should try out  urlLink The Dead Case . It's an excellent flash game that I found interesting.   I'm off to bed, have to be to work at nine tomorrow.
