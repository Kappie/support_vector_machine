I love helpin u ppl out, but if i don't want u to help me then fuckin stop tellin me that i need help and i need someone to help me...i will repeat this til the day that i no longer use this blog, "i made this blog for the purpose of myself, if u guyz read it, its all good in the hood. But if u try to help me, i'm fine with that. But if i don't want to b helped, then build a bridge and get over it cuz i ain't goin to fuckin explain whats the proble"...i like u ppl ya know, u guyz r very important to me, but whoever this "a" person is, he/she should fuckin go get a life cuz he/she can't even run his/her life, and this person tries to tell me what to do...fuck that...payce.  p.s. "a" person- if u tell me who u r, that will show more respect...but i still hate u...payce.
