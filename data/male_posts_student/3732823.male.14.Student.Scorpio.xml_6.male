I was so cute I got my first girlfreind there, Rebecca. Rebecca was a cute little girl. Blonde hair, blue eyes. The first time i ever experienced seperation anxiety was when i was four...Rebbeca is like 3 months older than me so when she turned 5 they put her in the big kid rooms. I was stuck alone playing with blocks. I never got moved to the big kids room...they just threw me into 1st grade! The bloody bastards! I was a really hyper and active little boy. I drove everyone completely insane! One time i was in the office with a day care lady and she was talking on the phone...I was just sitting there with the phone right in front of me...It came as a natual instinct...I used one tiny finger to hang up the phone. That woman stared at me in utter disbeleif. "Boy! Get yo butt outta here! I'll be talkin to yo mama son!"  I served a hefty punishment for that one! I don't wanna get in to it though, someone might call HRS... I also ran around in circles, hit myself with things, and laugh out loud for no reason.  I swear to god the things i'm about to say are absolutely true... Bay Watch was, for some strange unknown reason, very popular among the 4 year olds at Tot Learning Center. We used to always pretend that we were lifegaurds. We always got laughed at whenever we pretended to give CPR. Adults thought it was funny for some reason. There was one guy named Charley, he was a volunteer who spent some time with the kids every week. We where all playing Robin Hood, and Charlie played Robin Hoood and I played the Kings advisor dude, they didn't call me advisor dude though...I was known as the Kings " special helper". I advised that we hang Robin Hood and Charly said very sheakspearian... "You shall hang me if you wish! But the poor and my men will carry on my deed and you shall fall..." We stared at him like he was a purple apple...Final my freind Jordan, who played the King, said "What?!?"  Charlie cracked up and ran off.  I always had Will though, Will was my best friend! We was really loyal for a 4 year old! He stuck up for me when I got in trouble and he lied for me when I did something evil...He was my Samwise Gamgee! I never know what happened to him though.   My first rival was named Micheal...I was so jealous of Micheal and i hated him so much! He was one of those snotty little kids! He had a huge bowl haircut! I had a bowl haircut but it was a cereal bowl haircut, not a salad bowl! He always cried and got what he wanted. People just laughed at my cuteness and walked away! Once I always had someone smiling at me and my cute self, Micheal would cry about something and they'd go and tend to him and leave me to play with blocks! One time Micheal fell down and smacked his head against the fence. ooooh! He did'nt pass out but he got a huge scrape on his forhead when his head hit that cement. First the kid hits his head on the fence pole, then he slams his forehead against the cement. This is the same kid who cryed his friggin balls out over a teeny tiny needle prick! I dare not describe the sounds that came from his mouth! I had no clue the human vocal cords could produce moans and screeches like that. He got so much attention over a little scrape and bruise. I was a real attention seeker back then...I was so pathetic that i ran around the play ground banging my head into things trying to get real hurt!  One day, during naptime, Micheal had a bad dream. A horrible, terrible nightmare, he was crying blood! It didn't rain that day but we got two inches of water! It was amazing! The kid had to go because he was so messed up. And he had like four adults tending to his every need. I felt so jealous that I closed my eyes and thought of the scariest thing a 4 year old could think of...the skeleton dudes head from Tales Of The Crypt with a yellow and red spiral behind him. I really tried to cry but it wasn't good enough for Shanteria! "Oh hush up! Ol dirty lier!!" she said to me when i whimpered about a bad dream...  I hope you now realize that i love attention...Now if you think i was a bad kid then...HA!
