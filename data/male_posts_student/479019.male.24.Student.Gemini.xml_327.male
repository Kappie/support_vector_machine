There's a battle between the repression of traditional life and the modern sensibility of freedom. While Vianne and Anouk cause a little French town to open up, David and Jennifer cause the town of Pleasantville to open up. The people don't just open up themselves from the self repression that they previously suffered from (like the French townspeople during Lent), but they open themselves up to the possibility of social change in the face of not knowing what is to come. The possibilites of change and progress are, of course, modern ideas.   I have Pi and the Maltese Falcon sitting around to be watched. I'll save those for the weekend. Along with baking cookies!  ***
