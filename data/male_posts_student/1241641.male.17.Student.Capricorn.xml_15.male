Not only am I working at Panera but I am also helping miscellaneous St. Ambrose offices move into the new university center.  Not only am I helping miscellaneous St. Ambrose offices move into the new university center but I am also studying for my amateur radio operator's license.  But I found some time to give you the scoop, Betty Boop.  I'd like to announce to my friends in radio land that Colin and I will be broadcasting live from Bix Fest 2004 on Saturday, July 24, from 5pm-8pm.  Come on down and see us!  I think we'll be giving away some KALA trinkets and such if you need a bribe.  By the way, my nose cut is just a bruise now.  There is really nothing to say...
