Better items too. And i have a game GF who I've never seen b4 in real life but who cares, I am l33t ur not. Haha". don't believe me? Try heading to the PvP rooms at any given time of the day  you'll see my point.       if that's not enough, hacks  full botters abound! mRO players please take no offence as i do not refer to anyone in particular. just that the mRO GM team should make an effort to stop these hackers and botters. i realize i am a botter too, but why do i bot? read paragraph 2. in iRO(international RO) GM's and sub-GM's actually walk around in-game to catch botters, cheaters and abusers who totally spoil the overall gaming experience. go ahead and check out the iRO site and see for yourself.       screw this. i'm heading for those private servers where killing 10 fabres gets you to lv50+ no problem. i'm heading there for the rewarding virtual items. i'm heading there to play for free instead of paying rm38 to bot. i'm heading there where, even if unofficial, GM's ban  suspend botters. i'm heading there to meet in-game girls who are well informed, and who do not come off as Ah Lians at first glance. i'm heading there where most of my enlightened friends are already having guild wars at a regular basis(suck on this mRO playas!) and where not everyone is a complete jerk off. i'm heading there to have FUN.       i can't believe it took me a year and 4 months to realise this. oh well. trial and error i guess.       *  while most of this blog consists mainly of my complaints, take note however, that most of this blog is FACT. if you've played it long enough, you'll believe me. oh, and for those guilds who keep "sapu-ing" the PvP rooms, i hope someone teaches them a lesson in ruining the whole PvP experience. those bastards.                ~fin~
