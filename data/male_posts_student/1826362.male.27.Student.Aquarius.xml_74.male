I was trying to say something to my dad, and i had a loose tooth and I was trying to keep the tooth in place with my tounge, but it came out and i looked at it and there was this decaying hole on the side of it and i thought "that's what you get for not flossing"  usually in this dream, my tooth just comes loose and falls out, and I never know the cause of it.  And sometimes it is a front tooth that crumbles away without getting loose first.
