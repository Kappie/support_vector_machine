I'm not a huge fan of Christian Punk - quite a weird/nice concept.  Sam May's dad gave Me and Dave (and Sam obviously) Which was nice of him, his driving is either too fast, or my 'rents are really cautious drivers, lol, I'm guessing the latter.  Saw quite alot of people there though, which rocked the mizzhouse, Charm and Jen decided to take so loads of caffine pills, which meant Charm's arse started to vibrate, apparently is was 9/10 amazing, whatever that means.. Alot of guys from my sixform were there, Ging and Tom where taking alot of photos, the gig was in Wilson's school, why are all schools so much nicer than mine? And apparently "you don't touch a brova's pig tails muffa fukka" but u know I don't have t' pizz- pizz -pizzup wit dat mi brizane.  School this week was really hard, and I've got another 5 weeks of this.. turns out it was 6 weeks till easter, dammit. We got a new English Teacher "Mr. Twohig" and parents evening is next week, which should be interesting...  I wish I had an interesting weekend ahead of me, but I really don't, I'm gunna have to find something to do, or end up trying to be spontanious, and end up going outside to be bored and cold rather than inside bored and cold.. but then again I do need to go out to buy more video games, I'm in short supply. Beyond Good and Evil is supposed to out now, and cheap cas no-one bought it on PS2, so it's cheap on GameCube =D  Why is Russia called Russia.
