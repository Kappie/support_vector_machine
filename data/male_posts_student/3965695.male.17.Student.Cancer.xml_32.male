My dad, when he became president of gettysbug hospital, also became contractially (not spelled correctly) obligated to buy property in Adams county. And so we got a pretty sweet little cabin thing near two lakes with a volleyball court in the back yard. Its alot like the cabins you can rent at Pinchot, if you have ever seen those, except about two-three times as big.  That, my first extended public excursion since surgery, was very nice but made me extremely tired- so much so that I woke up Sunday morning and really couldnt go to church, which was a bummer.  The doc said today that I can start doing more stuff- no driving yet, and no real physical activity, but we might be able to squeeze in a short vacation. I can sit pretty long now and things are looking up. This is the first really good news i have had in a couple weeks. Yay for recovering.  The altoid gum stuff is really good. try some.  I watched the entire xgames. I am officially stoked
