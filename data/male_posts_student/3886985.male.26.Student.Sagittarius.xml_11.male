I used to swim in high school, and still do it for fun and to stay in shape. Now, I was above average in high school, but nowhere near good enough to do anything with it. But it's fun, a great workout, and exciting to watch.  NBC is broadcasting the US Olympic Trials from Long Beach, taped earlier today. My first comment is that I'm pissed that I forgot it was going on - I would have driven up there to see this live.  Michael Phelps is an 18 year-old phenom of the sport, who has set a few world records and is so good that Mark Spitz (a world famous Australian Olympic swimmer, and multiple world record holder) has been quoted as saying that this kid could break his record of 7 Gold Medals. He didn't even show his "A" game in the 200m freestyle, and whooped up on the competition.  Natalie Coughlin, who was widely regarded as an "up-and-comer" in 2000 (but then suffered a devastating shoulder injury), started her comeback a few years ago, and she is ON. She's the ONLY American woman to ever complete the 100m backstroke in under 1:00. (If you don't know swimming, that is GREAT.) Well, she didn't get a great start off the block, but she did it AGAIN. 0:59.85. Oh. My. God. AND she's a massive hottie. Where do I go to meet her?
