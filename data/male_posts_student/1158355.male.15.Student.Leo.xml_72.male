And we scorched the sky, thinking they needed solar power for life but not knowing instead of the sun they used, they would instead defeat us and use us for their own power. After our defeat, they discovered the power we held and duplicated us to an infinite amount. With this endless power source, they created a new world for us where we could let off our power throughout a dream for their benefit. That is what The Matrix is.
