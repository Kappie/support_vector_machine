He got a tatoo of big Ann's flaps, old habits die hard, takes me back to geog last year the hours he spent pokin' off a jotter and fuckin a table all in the name of Ann. Then i got an A, total pro and all that. Young Jean asked me to go to his gathering that young  urlLink Downey  and probably young  urlLink Michael  will be goin' to. The old Franklyn's trip is agreed for Saturday aswell so it might be an action packed weekend ye know full of twists, turns, suprises, a twist in the tail ? Some violence ? a sex scandal ? Or probably just a shitey anti-climax. I've got work on Monday it will be utter pish i keep thinking though I am losing my long lie but I'm no i start at 5 anyay it will be shite I am too shy for this kind of work especially the training thats basically so whats you're claim to fame ? In front of 50 people I will have to tell of the legendary time our wee pishy athletics club was on channel 3. Ahahaha. I spoke to young Jimmy "superstar" Strain for the first time in ages aswell he has left the legendary Airdrieonians Fc for the glamourous E.K Thistle. I was quite disappointed at gettin' into Strathy cos young Jimmy is goin' to Bell and he woulda been a much better person to be goin wae than fuckin poofy prick im landed wae now. Aww well, young Andy has also started his thing see 4 merry men now it's catchin' on. All this talk about Jean's b/day made me think wit I'm gonna do for mine, a party would be a shitey anti-climax and to quote big Jim from American Pie there would be "an abundance of weener" present, so probably goin' out somewhere wae 'a couple a guys, couple a beers' situation before it, but Cheesy works ahhh fuckin scotmid. So probably Franklyns at night while im stil 17 then after midnight anywhere cos I will be 18 we will finally be free cos Cheesy will be 18 aswell. Sorted. Cannae wait. But thats in the future, tomorrow is the key i need to think of something to get young Brian. adios
