I'm still debating whether "pews" is an actual word or if Ian just made it up. :P Help me out, dictionary.com.  So rather than D, we ended up doing alot of  Whose Line is it Anyway?  games and went swimming in his pool. That was fun.  And so much for being on schedule with comics. I now have quite a bit of make-up to do.
