I guess you have heard of IRC chats if not here is a tutorial for setting up the right programme  For people who know IRC are IRC channel is #rafrn and it is hosted at abducted.us check  urlLink www.abducted.us  for their list of servers.   Tutorial  First of all download  urlLink X-Chat  and install it as the intructions tell you to. Then do the following: Under nicknames put YOUR NICK in the next box YOUR NICK_ and then in the next box YOUR NICK__ make sure  all  the underscores are on there.The username and realname can contain anything it doesn't matter. Make sure your Bar at the top when you start X-Chat says "X-Chat Server List" then click the checkbox next to "Edit Mode" Then under Networks click add new and double click slowly to change name, not to launch it, then change the name to Abduted. Then under servers click new and double click to change its name to irc.abducted.us. Under channels add in #rafrn and then click connect you should then be taken on to the IRC network. Then if you have not already done so type the following: /ns register PASSWORD YOUREMAIL then it will say you have been registered then send  urlLink email me  so he can add you to the Access List.  -Tweak
