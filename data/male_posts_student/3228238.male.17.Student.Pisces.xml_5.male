Some of these are the sort of things that I think about in order to give me a little boost.  I hope this helps anyone who needs a push in going to daily Mass (especially if it may be early in the morning).  1  You miss a personal visit with Jesus, author of all spiritual energy and of all holiness.  2  You lose a special increase of sanctifying grace, which makes your soul more pleasing to God.  3  You lose a quota of sacramental grace, which entitles you to special help in times of temptation and in the discharge of your daily duties.  4  You lose a precious opportunity of having all your venial sins wiped away.  5  You miss the special preserving influence which each Holy Communion confers against the fires of passion.  6  You miss the opportunity of having remitted a part, or all, of the temporal punishment due to your sins.  7  You lose the spiritual joy, the sweetness, and particular comfort that come from a fervent Holy Communion.  8  You lose part of the glory that your body might enjoy at its resurrection on the Last Day.  9  You lose the greater degree of glory you might possess in Heaven for all eternity.  10  You may lose a) Complete victory over some fault or passion. b) Some particular grace long prayed for. c) The conversion or salvation of some soul. d) Deliverance of a relative or friend from Purgatory. e) Many graces for others, both the living and the dead.  Will a few extra minutes of sleep repay you for these losses?
