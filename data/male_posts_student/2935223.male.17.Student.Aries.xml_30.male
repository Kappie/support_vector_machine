If it weren't for that fuckin' fortune, none of this woulda happened. I will explain now. In Japan, I went to a shrine thingy and got a bad luck fortune that said that following: Your body is one but with two different kind mind, so everything goes out of order.  Just like lunar eclipse make all dark, al will be at dark.  Though fortune approaches to you, but you can't get it. Just like a fish can't meet water, there may be so many possibility to be a bad case for you.  As I have found...this has all come true.  I royally fucked myself over.  I basically told the only girl to actually love me that I couldn't go out with her ecause I was interested in someone else....UNFORTUNATELY, the other girl doesn't like me in anyway what-so-ever.  So, I think that I might just go die sumwhere, because I felt like a big piece of shit, and then the first girl*Keli* is avoiding me, and I feel really bad, and I'm pretty sure that she has already forgotten about me, and wants nuthin' to do with me because I'm such an ass.  I never said that I didn't have feelings for Keli, just...I still had feelings for Tina, and my mind went one way, but I wanted to go a different.... unfotunately my mind won.  I now feel very stupid and want to jump off a cliff, but....that's ok.  I'm sure that sumday I will find sumone who likes me and I won't screw them over, or be screwed over by other people.  I now have to go to work..... I'm sorry to everyone who has had to listen to my BS.....but I'm mostly sorry to Keli.  I wish that you would forgive me, then again..I hope you don't, just so that I can't hurt you again or sumthin'....god I'm a fucktard. Peace!  Spense
