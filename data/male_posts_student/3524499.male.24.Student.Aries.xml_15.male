If we have tine over the course of next week then we should try to implement the access control policies into our VPN software.   LIST OF THINGS TO DO(TO BE WRITTEN BY ME)  Other than the 2nd phase extension, Manish felt that we have plenty to be getting on with and that we should concentrate on prioritising our workloads over the next 4 weeks. A list of remaining tasks will subsequently be produced by myself listing everything that needs to be completed. I will also create a new work timetable listing the deadlines for the last month.  TESTING  Testing was also discussed and the group was given good advice about the structure of any testing and how to document testing for the group report.   The testing should be broken down into the following sections;  1. Unit Testing. What is being tested? How is the unit being tested? What are the results of the unit testing? How are we documenting the test?  2. Integration testing. What integration tests are being carried out? How? What are the integration test results? Problems? Successes? Failures?  3. Overall testing. Does the application work within specification? Formal test results? Documentation?  THE GROUP REPORT  The group report structure has now been approved by the project group and a small amount of progress has been made.  The structure of the report will also be forwarded to Manish/Steve to seek further approval/critisism.  Thats all for now.  Olly
