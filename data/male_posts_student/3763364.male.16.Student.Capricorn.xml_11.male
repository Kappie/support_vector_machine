Some people make a living out of it.    It's weird, it's 11:30, but it feels like 3 am. I guess it's because my entire sleep/wake cycle is out of whack. I din't sleep at all the night before, and I doubt I will tonight. Whatthe hell is keeping me awake!? I love sleep! AAAAAAAGH!  Whatever.  That quiz that's in the very first bit of my blog, I lied on it. I DO daydream. I dream every day. What do I dream of, you ask? Why, I dream of that which I seek. My mind paints me pictures of a future that does not exist, and I gawk at it likean American tourist looking at The Mona Lisa.  I dream of nights, when her and I are living together, and we have just finished dinner, but I am rather dissatisfied with the mundane meal, so I yell "You call this dinner, bitch!?" and she yells back "YOU MADE IT!!!" And yes, I did, indeed cook dinner. Then we both smile and laugh together. It's ok.  I dream of us driving down the raod together. To where, we do not know, but that does not matter, all that matters is thejourney and the people involved; her and I. We both know this. It's ok.  The way things are looking, I don't suppose I'll ever sleep again. Rather, sleep will change into drifting off during the day into the world that I seek most. Until, one day, either by tans-substantiation, or reality itself, I am for once placed in those dreams in the stead of my imagination.  It's eleven thirty, I'm sitting here in my underwear, as per usual, writing this very post.   You know, we've all changed. I'm an even bigger bitterer, more cynical killjoy than I was before. With anego the size of Louise Brooks' neglige taped to my already proposterously sized head.  She has become belligerent, belligerent like HIM. She has become, oh, I don't quite have the word for it, all head-in-the-clouds-believing-nonsense-resenting-the-harsh-truth-like (I'm sorry, my IQ is down a few points, and I am at a loss for words), just like HIM!  I shouldn't even be mad at a thing like this. But I am. The fact that she is becomming more and more like him, relating and liking himmore and more, shocks me to the very core. I know it shouldn't but it fucking does. And damn me straight to hell for it.  That night, when she got me to list off things about him that would make her hate him, I knew I had failed. I knew that, no matter how long that list got,her feelings were irevocable. That sort of thing is only a last-ditch eforrt. I knew I would soon be walking down that same path again. Lo and behold, here I am! The path is a little different, perhaps the seasons have changed or something, but it sure as hell is the same path. I shouldn't be ranting about this. I shouldn't be saying a lot of the shit I say. Why? Because it is going to cost me everything, that's why.  Him. Him. HIM. HIM! It beguiles me. It pains me.   Which feels worse: killing or being killed?  The answer to that one is obvious for someone in my vantage point. Killing is worse. Killing is horrible.I am killing. It makes me feel horrible. You are what you do, I say.    Some how, "I told you so" just doesn't cut it.
