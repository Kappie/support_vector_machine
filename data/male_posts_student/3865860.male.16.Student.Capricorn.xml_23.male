Its so great there its huge and there is loads of alt clothes shops i bought three shirts it totally ruled i'm so going back and i recommend it everyone. Apart from that i went to the ballet and went on a carosel. Today was so great i love going on random trips its what make life interesting. The trains were actually on time aswell which actually made the whole trip enjoyable the only thing that could have been changed  would be the heat, it was kinda hot. Anyway if you ever fancy going on a random trip with me to like London or Paris tell me because i can get free accomadation in Versailles :) Haven't seen you guys for a while but i hope to soon.
