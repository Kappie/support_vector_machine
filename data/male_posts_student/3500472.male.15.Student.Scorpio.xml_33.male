ITS CRAZY! so shes on my list of people to marry. and then i got a new cool polo shirt from anchor blue (i like polo shirts now and i dunno why...theyre purtty comfy though) annnnnd i go 5 "A shirts" ihave to call them that cuz my mommy doesnt like the term "wife beaters" but i can understand that, cuz that's kind of a harsh name (especially for a shirt). so ya, today was a pretty good day... got ahair cut, saw my future wives, gota new cd, and i got new shirts...oh there was a part in king arthur that almost made me cry. cuz KIERA's fingers were broken so they had to break them back into place...and we all know how much i HATE it when people do things to their toes and fingers.... imcringing right now from the sound of that part in the movie...ITS SOOOO GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
