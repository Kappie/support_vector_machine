At this moment our P2P Framework is using MD5 as hashing algorithm, perhaps we should change, but I'm worried about performance hits. On the bright side, spring is in the air. My street is filled with pink and white petal trees emanating a very nice smell. I've been thinking and realized that the rising rents might be a result of the unstable market, but then again how come it's Bologna-only?
