LoL...so, the guy's name is Frank, and he showed up to my house, but parked like 100 ft away from it. he called, and said that he was sitting in front of my house--although he wasnt really in front of it. oh well! there was another kid in the car, and his name was Grant. he didnt talk much...asian kid, only going to be a junior this year. Frank asked me if i had ever driven before, and i said "No". heard that if you tell them you have driven, you get fined b/c its illegal! so, he told me he would drive Grant home. so, we drove over on Hesperian to take him home--he lived kinda in the cutties. then, i had to drive around these houses like a nerd for like 15 minutes..then i got to take the jankey '95 toyota corrola out for a spin on the REAL ROAD MWAHAHA LoL! i drove really well, and had to go to like 3 different cities...took about 2 hours or so, and then as we pass my house, he tells me NOT to stop...he told me to go all the way up the hill and turn left--this was a dead end. he had me make a 3 point turn, which i wasn't half at if i do say so myself....so, we park for like 10 minutes, and he explained to me what he wanted me to accomplish before i take my driving test. so, as we drive back home, my parents are gone. as we were driving past them to go up the hill, i noticed that they were packing up our car with some beach stuff....so, i got out of the car, said byebye to Frank, and walked up the stairs. to my surprise, NO ONE WAS HOME. i reached into my pocket only to realize that i hadn't taken my key with me. i called me parents, and they said: too bad..you're gonna have to wait outside--we're on our way to Half Moon Bay for the rest of the day (it's only like 2:15 pm). im like: MOTHER FO! soooo i walked around to the other side of the house--but everything was locked, and every window was closed shut...so i did what i only knew to do: call laura! she said that she would come and get me after she was done shopping! LoL! something i would say, huh laura? haha...so, talked to mom 2 (mrs white), and she said to keep her posted if i busted in my house LoL! i was starving and i wasnt about to go pee outside, so i busted through my downstairs bathroom. had to take the windows out, and bust this piece of wood...and finally climb through "half dressed". only took me about 10 minutes to bust in, but i figured that i would let my parents feel guilty--so i didnt tell them i busted in. had some lunch, blasted some music, and took a nap....barely got any sleep--but "whatev" as laura would say heh! parents came home, didnt really care that i had got in OK...figures, right? well, spent the rest of the day on the comp like a loser, and didnt do much...went to the video store, but found absolutely nothing i want to see---well, i mean, i found a lot, but nothing that i would rent and watch with my parents haha...gotta wait until i have alone time to watch my indie films i guess. soo tomorrow, picking up whitie for sunday school (i think im gonna drive hehe), and then i dunno what else im doing. her parents are gone, so we agreed FOR SURE we would chill tomorrow night--dinner party, right katy? LoL sooo guess i better go and watch some TV before bed. nighty night peeps!
