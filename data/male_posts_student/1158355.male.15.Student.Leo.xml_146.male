Later in the day I was washing my hands when the phone rang, and I thought to myself if I dry them I won't make it in time to answer the phone. I made my choice, dry my hands, then I ran to the phone and as soon as I picked up, click, they hung up. The problem is choice. I think I can see the future. If I picked up the phone, something would have changed. Maybe the entire day would be different. Maybe I'd be out of this world, but the thing is, no matter what happens, you must not stop looking for the clues. The changes, dejavu...there was a change. Which brings me to my next coincidence. Just before as I was putting on Return of The Jedi on the vcr, I pressed play and didn't realize the TV wasn't on video. What came up on the screen was Episode II, the very dramatic scene where Anakin and Senator Amadala discuss their romantic issues. I thought someone had changed my Return of The Jedi to Episode II until I then realized, "Ooooh, this is on tv!" and I changed the channel, and sure enough it was on Starz or something. Well, I put the TV on video and put on Return of The Jedi and it was at the once again very dramatic scene where Luke tells Leah they're brother and sister. Dejavu, a change...cause and effect...causality. The cause was last night watching Return of The Jedi and falling asleep half way through, effect being realizing this weird coincidence and being aware of something truely confidential and special. These thoughts to not make any sense to most of you but I must express them to the public. Be the person who hates to live a lie, and searches for clues wherever that person is. That is all.
