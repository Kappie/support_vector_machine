The first week I was at band camp which was amazing.  I had a great time.  I met so many new friends.  Dani and I made up.  Yes I said it.  She apologized first of course though.  I won a scholorship so I get to back for free next year.  I had 9 solos in the whole concert.  I couldn't believe it! I got to do a jazz ballad that featured me which was cool cause I have never gotten to do that.  Well anyways I will move on because I don't want to make this too long.  The following week I left for Indiana with Sarah and Ryan.  We went and stayed the night at her Aunt's house.  It was fun, I got to sleep the whole way down which was nice.  Sarah's aunt was really nice and her cousin was cool too.  The next day we went to camp.  Camp was amazing, I am so glad I went.  The first few days were a little tough.  I wasn't having that much fun and I wasn't sure if I would want to go back.  Then I started to have more fun and I started to grow closer to God which was amazing.  I am so glad that all of my friends talked me into going because I don't think I would have went if they hadn't pushed me.  I wasn't sure if going to one camp after the next was going to be wise, but I am so happy I did it.  That camp has so many awesome people there and they helped me come closer to God.  Now that camp is over I think I would really like to go on a missions trip somewhere.  Well thats what I have been doing these past two weeks.  They were definetly well spent.  They were some of the best weeks of my life.  Today on the other hand wasn't so great.  I had to work and I think everyone knows how I feel about work sometimes.  I hate it.  We were so busy and stupid people were working so I had no one helping me fill orders.  It sucked and on top of that I had the usual dumb customers who are retarded and don't know how to order at a McDonalds.  Sometimes I like work though, people that come through like Ethel can really brighten your day and those customors are the ones that remind you why you work there.  Well I think thats about it, 3 novels later. haha I think I am going to go know and enjoy the nice summer weather.
