I got played in a horrible way, still, I love him. I have this impulse of seeing him, I want a moment to hug him and kiss him, but, we are just "friends" now... Should I just let him go, or should I say to him that I don't care what happened, that I'll try to win him back, even though as I see, he was never mine.  My heart hurts, my head hurts, sometimes thinking of him I just can't breath... I really love him, and I can't understand why... Am I just so stupid? I feel so bad I even thought of talking to my exbf, but that's not the solution, I won't do to others what has been done to me.  Look, Adrian, I know that if you read this it will be long after the day it was posted, so here it goes: When we were at the movies, I felt that we shouldn't be there, I tried to be as cool as possible and be a friend, but I noticed how you changed. I know now that you don't love me as I do, that's my problem, not yours, and I'll try to work it out. When u left me at Selwicks, I tried not to look back, not to cry, but I did. Sometimes I feel you do stuff just to hurt me on purpose, I don't know. Maybe I need to be apart from you for a few days, but I fear I might loose you all together, I can't let that happen. You are an important part in my life now.  I was reading your emails, man, I don't know what to think... you said you loved me, you said you thought of me, you said I was in your plans... what happened? what really happened?... I'm so angry at you, I could just hit you in the face so you could know how much you hurt me. But in all, I just wish for you to hug me, kiss me and hold me as I try to fall asleep. Tell me you love me even though we know is not true.    Why does the sun go on shining?  Why does the sea rush to shore?  Don't they know it's the end of the world  'Cause you don't love me any more?   Why do the birds go on singing?  Why do the stars glow above?  Don't they know it's the end of the world?  It ended when I lost your love.   I wake up in the morning and I wonder  Why ev'rything's the same as it was.  I can't understand, no I can't understand  How life goes on the way it does   Why does my heart go on beating?  Why do these eyes of mine cry?  Don't they know it's the end of the world?  It ended when you said goodbye   Don't they know it's the end of the world?  It ended when you said goodbye.   The End of the World. Vonda Shepard.
