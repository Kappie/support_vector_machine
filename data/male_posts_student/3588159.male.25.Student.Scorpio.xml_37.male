When I paused momentarily at a stop sign, I saw something amusing. A small column of chubby, salon-tanned girls were power walking their way toward the Plaza, Kansas City’s (only) historic, ritzy shopping district. The last adventurer in this plucky band had a Camelbak hydration system strapped to her back, presumably to keep her cool and wet in the arid wilds of the Plaza.  Uh, Ashley…like, wait. Help me…crawl to the nearest GAP.      Is that symptomatic of our culture or what?
