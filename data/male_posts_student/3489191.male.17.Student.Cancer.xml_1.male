Unfortunately, I didn't get to the event that I was looking forward to, but hey, I'm ever so closer.   I've decided to half-ass about the review of The Day After Tomorrow.   In short, it's a protest against global warming and the burning of fossil fuels with a dramatic story thrown in to underlie the movie's true nature.  And in other news, expect an actual review of Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban sometime next week.  I've already got most of it written, and will finish it up after I see the movie again next weekend.
