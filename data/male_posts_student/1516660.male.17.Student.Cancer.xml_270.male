That idiot arse was not really late, but was late all the same. can't he get up early? i bet that vainpot is styling himself in front of the mirror every morning. Anyone who knows him can basically tell already. What a narcissist.). We got to school.  Yeah. They went to their own class, while I sat in the canteen reading my book. Soon, i was approached by a teacher. She told me to go up to the office to appeal lor. Luckily I was not scolded or anything la. I was told by the clerk to wait for Mrs Kwang, the one in-charge for appeals.  That teacher looked at my report book and commented that my grades were not that good. Bitch. HELLO! My grades were good hor! Darn you. Then, I said that I come to YJ because PJ don't offer me the subject combination I wanted. That Kwang said that "So if PJ offer you Chem Bio, you would choose PJ right?". Yeah, I admit. She got it lor. I have no loyalty whatsoever towards YJ. Fianlly, she said the transfers were closed and it would be a real hassle to get me inside, besides, I am not loyal to YJ and I got bad grades. I was really polite and said "I am sorry for bothering you". Ayioh!! Idiot. Their bad for losing me then. Hello lor. People are quitting YJ right and left, and you are being picky on someone who wants to come in? Please la. Consider yourself lucky someone actually wanted to come inside lor.   I asked my parents to fetch me. We are going to Marsiling market to eat and buy some groceries. I ate black carrot cake. After that, I went back to bath, while parents went to Sheng Shiong to buy more groceries and two bowls of shark fins for me. YaY!     Hmm....shark fins taste as nice as ever. After some web surfing, I cooked noodles for myself. Ended up overcooking them, taste so soft. At 2, me and Dad left for the bank to withdraw my money.  Oh my god. The queue's so long. Extend from the inside to the outside lor. I was like very very sian. I learnt at the end that I have been queueing for 2 hours! Oh my! 2 hours of inching along. The queues can kill (it rhymes). I got my $70, which I am gonna use it to buy my two books (Harry Potter hint/clue books) from Kinokuniya . Yeah.   After that, I went to Metro to return Wendy her comic book. It looks like she reserved a MahJong set! YaY! Can play with her le! Moo meow!! We are planning to play on the second day of CNY. Anycat is welcome!  I came online, went online for awhile and went to eat dinner at 768. I came back, bathed, watched some TV and then came online again. Ha.   Seriously hor, I don't know what I am gonna do now lor. Probably stay home and rot. ACtually, not. I am gonna self-study at home. I can also go find a job. Sigh. I am confused liao. Moo meow meow!  I think I log off le la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
