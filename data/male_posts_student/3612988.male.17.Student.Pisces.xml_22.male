HAPPY BIRTHDAY JIANGUANG!!! woohoo! went for project work interview at the maid agency today. was kinda interesting because i learnt alot about the situation of emplyers with maids and how they can affect the children. cool man. i wanna work and be a professional, haha, so at least i can preach to others.  kinda down today. dunno leh. perhaps there's nothing much to be happy ba. in school so sian. can only slack around. talk cock with jon and tim. nothing much to talk to the class. see them say hi then walk away. hai. oh ya! the kayaking competition started today. hmm. wonder how the guys fare. hope can do well la. some thoughts: 2 years in jc...will i get back that warm feeling as i had in chs? i had wonderful classes from sec1 to 4, though we do have cliques but we accept everyone. i can go around disturbing people without restraining myself. yet in vj, i feel very controlled. well i guess everywhere is the same. sometimes i want to get involved in the class but dare not because i'm afraid. it's such a different me. come on man. the DANIEL POH was sucha a mischievious and crappy guy la. now...a zombie. nah! shall shut up now. f*** man....
