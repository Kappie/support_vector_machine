HeHe.  Today leh, our whole family went to some 'temple' to pray la. Give our thanks for blessing us. It's what we call a home-made temple lor, so I have no idea whether it is legal or not. Okay, so I was supposed to be blessed la. The lady had to throw two cresent-shape stone thingys to see whether the blessing successful or not la. HAHA! She had to throw 5 times, because the first 4 times the god 'rejected' the blessing! She have to keep muttering more and more blessings. I find it quite hilarious. Oh... what I said meant no offense to Buddhist, but I really find it funny lor. I wonder what the lady thinks about me....  Okay, after eating at AMK Central, I came back to sleep. Yeah. Sleep. Need to conserve and recharge energies for tonight. Hmm...today's dinner is instant noodles. So nice!  Okay...I end liao la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
