Palestinian reaction bordered on Euphoric;  urlLink the Guardian reports :  The Palestinian UN observer, Nasser al-Kidwa, praised the resolution as possibly the most important passed by the general assembly since the 1947 vote partitioning British-ruled Palestine between Arabs and Jews.  Israel's response was about as predictable. Dan Gillerman, the ambassador to the UN, put it this way: "It is simply outrageous to respond with such vigour to a measure that will save lives."  Well, Dan, the ends always justify the means, don't they?
