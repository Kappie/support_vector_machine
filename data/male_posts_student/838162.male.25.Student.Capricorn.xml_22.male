With more and more households having more than a single PC, together with the cheaper and more widespread use of broadband internet connections such as DSL and cable, home networking is becoming more and more of a highly viable option.  There are many ways of connecting PC’s into a network. With Cabled network (ethernet) being the most common, fastest and cheapest. However, running the cables sometimes takes a degree of planning and may occur additional cost such as having to drill holes to pass the cables through. The biggest limitation however, is that the cable limits the mobility of the PC. Therefore it is not recommended for laptops.  This is where wireless networks come in. They consist of a “base station” which usually has a router build in to share the broadband connection. It is easy to call the base station a “transceiver” and each of the computers in the network a “receiver”. However since the wireless connection is two-way, it is more similar to a set of walkie talkies that are always on all the time.  There are several ways to connect a computer to a wireless network. With the most common devices being an internal card or an external box. The main differences between the two seem to be speed, simplicity of installation and cost. Typically internal cards are cheaper and faster but more of a headache to install, while external devices are more costly and slower but are mostly plug  So in the end, the stuff you need for a Wireless network is: - A ethernet based DSL/Cable modem - A base station - and a wireless connection device for each computer that will be connected to the network  I personally recommend getting stuff from  urlLink Linksys .
