What the body is saying, "Haley you f*cking idiot, you're gay, get over it, get out of that sham marriage and for Christ sake, act normal for once!". He is homosexual, always been homosexual and will remain homosexual for the rest of his life. He can continue banging his wife whilst claiming that he is "satisfied" because he has a couple of offspring, but he knows he is living a lie.  I'll bet my bottom dollar that they've had sex probably 3 times in their whole "marriage" with Haley running off to have a cold shower after every experience.  The humorous part:  "Reparative therapy can include exploring masculine and feminine identities, uncovering childhood trauma and abuse, attempting cognitive reframing, medication and exploiting fears of sexually transmitted diseases or eternal damnation, said Daniel Helminiak, professor of psychology at the University of West Georgia."  Great, when all else fails, and they can't ram roles down the victims throats, claim someone has touched their penis, or blamed a lack of a father, why not simply scream at them for hours on end about a fictional damnation?! great, people wanted that treatment they would tune into the 700 Club.
