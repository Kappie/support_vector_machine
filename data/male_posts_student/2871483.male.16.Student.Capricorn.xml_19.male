All of a sudden... *Thud* "What the hell!?"*Thud Thud Thud*  Just the dog, still creeped me out.  -  Anyway, on to a little less creepy thing...  Somebody was signed onto my name.  Apparently, somebody's ping got through the firewall.  Here's how it happened.  ::I sign on:: *IM - AOL advisor something*:Your screenname is currently signed on in three locations...etc.etc.etc. Me:!?  I always have the computer signed on upstairs, however, combined with that computer and the one I'm currently on, unless I've forgotten how to count, is two.  This really freaked me out.  *I IM my own screenname*: Listen, asshole, get off my name!  I sign off.  Sign back on.  No more alert.  I changed my password to a completely different one, and plan on changing it regularly for a few weeks, I should be fine.  (It's the caffiene that's freaking me out...)  -  I have a lot of crap to do to me, preventing me from going out with my friends to the mall.  Damn, this sucks.  But, hey, I get to spend a couple days in Yuma, so all the better.  -  Cool thing - I just figured out how to put files other than music onto minidiscs....  I feel all...spylike.
