Not that anyone cares, but I just spent the first 36 minutes of my day adjusting the fantasy baseball lineups for my 6 teams today.  Dropping a couple of players, picking up a couple of players, proposing a trade, figuring out if Juan Rincon's 4 vulture wins as a reliever are a harbinger of more to come or just a fluke (I'm guessing just a fluke, but it's obviously just a guess).  It's funny how everything takes longer when there's a tax outline on your desk.
