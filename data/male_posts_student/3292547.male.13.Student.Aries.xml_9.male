This dude must have no life. So, I got the 3rd, but and not going to read it until I get the 2nd.  I also ran across a program that keeps track of how many click, scrolls, and keys you type. Then it uploads it on the sever. Apparently, it's a contest to see who can get the most.   Tiny KeyCounter is a small, entertaining utility that counts the number of keys you press, how many times you click the mouse, and how many times you use the mouse scroll wheel. All of your statistics are submitted to a centralized server so you can see how you compare to other users from around the world.  If you have no clue about me going to Wal-Mart, then I'm sorry, my post this morning didn't go through. I think the browser crash before it was done. I basically watered flowers and said I was going to get the second book in the series I'm reading.  After you sign up on Tiny Keycounter, go ahead and join a team. I'm " urlLink DriveThroughWindow " in the  urlLink Neowin  team. Maybe you can join and help us out. I'm sure I'll be up there pretty soon if I keep typing though... soo....see ya later.
