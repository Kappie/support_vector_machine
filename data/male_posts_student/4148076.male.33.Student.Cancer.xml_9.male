Tammie say, "that girl was eyeballing you", "you don’t try very hard", "being friends only gets you so far" and I think I should have tried harder with you. I think that what which I want is not to be obsessive and know every detail. I think that what I want is acutely that person, maybe not her, OK her, but not the one who was checking me out. There is nothing wrong with it, not that I thought there was. Not that I felt anything really except tight on the inside. To live in fear is a terrible thing. Today I did not. Today I took what I deserve, what everyone tells me to take, what is mine. These are the things that happen when I trust a little. Unable to establish a connection , surely the modem is correctly connected to the computer and phone line. Oh good anyway this is where you can spill you know that. Dear blog I could put it differently but I shouldn’t. So secret, not letting anyone in, you know this is no way to be, but in the obsessiveness I find little things that make me happy and I today counted. I did things wrong but at least I tried. Tomorrow I will test the switch again. Just because I like it simple does not mean I should not try. I need to try harder; fuck gurgle goes the air conditioner. Ro frag you can’t start a sentence with but. But nonetheless however are awkward. Breath and go back to Kenny and get it that is what this is all about just get it done and don’t worry and test the switch again. You scare me. You creep people out you know you do but you are loved other places. You know you will do better in a small shop. You know you will do better in a different town and I need to try harder and that is all there is to it. Not at doing it but making it happen. You’re not going to sleep until you finish the fucking essay. It is so bad I need transitional phrases. Except though moreover. I have to figure out what I am doing with the blog. I should post the archives and set it up but I really need to do the essay.
