That's why they call it heartache.  It's hit me a few times before, but tonight's was different. I was confused and shocked at the same time too. She's found someone new. Any lover knows that to love is to let go. I musn't be any lover then. My heart aches and I write.   The Jumper   Voices from afar beckon Loneliness’ paled pain to come back to earth. Coincidentally, desperation’s only intention sequels being perched precariously amidst the clouds.  The moonlight burns, zephyr’s too harsh. Confusion decides not. Chaos knows not when, how, what or why.  Colours in disarray, distress gazes down. Weakness the Cyclops looks only back. Pessimism tenders no leeway for brighter days.  Hopelessness is northward of ants who scurry 67 floors below. He quits; just to think of her once more. Eyes shut, warm. Cold.  The last leaf of fall. Humpty dumpty sat on the wall. Every tear’s natural course.   Goodnight. Let it be good. Jesus heal my heart.
