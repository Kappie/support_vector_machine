During breakfast my mom called and told me that we should probably cancel the Special Olympics because it was raining. We waited until 12:00 to make the decision on whether we should or shouldn't and by then it was warm and not raining so we decided to go for it. We went back to my house at 1:00 and I quickly got in the shower because it was gonna start at 1:30. Trent called right before I got in and so we had a chat but I handed the phone over to Kirsten so I could get in. She talked to him until I was out and all ready and then I talked to him. Kirsten wore a pretty sexy outfit to the Special Olympics. It's quite hard to explain. Between 1:30 and 1:45 people started showing up and by 2:00 we were over at the track goofing off. We only did one event, hurdles, and got bored with it so we jumped in water and stuff. Then we decided to go over to Abe. Trent decided we should play Survivor which was actually kind of fun. It was just a time to goof off. We were doing a "challenge" of playing soccer, first one to a goal wins, when it started raining. We were soaked by the time the game was over. We lost but whatever. I didn't really care. Julie, Melissa, and I then went back to my house to get water and let Julie go to the bathroom. We went back over and decided that we had to start the game over because the teams were unfair. Ryan nominated me as a team captain. Kalyn was the other team captain. When we decided to go back over to my house I was standing by a table and Katie comes up from behind me and ankels me. Well I have my period and my PMS kicked in right away. I run up to Katie shouting, "YOU BITCH! YOU BITCH!" I slapped her really hard then. I just ran home and started crying. She was trying to appologize to me because she didn't think I'd take it seriously but I was livid. I just did not want to talk to that girl. Before we went back over to Abe I helped my dad clean out the lawn mower. It was actually quite fun. So then we went back over to Abe and there were these water drops coming off the building so I stood under them. I was so wet when I got done. And then Trent wanted me to race him. I won. HAHAHA! But like Matt Koller and some high schoolers walked by and this one came up to us and he's like race me, race me. We never did race him. Then we went up to the playground part and just hung out for a while. By the time that was over we went back to my house. We just hung out there until everyone's parents came. After everyone left I asked my mom if I could spend the night at Kirsten's again but the stupid parent said no. Gosh I hate parents. While we ate Vince's Pizza we watched a movie called "A Guy Thing."
