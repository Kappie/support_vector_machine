Hopefully, I can help these girls. What will make this so interesting is the fact that I have not yet learned all the ways of the guitar. This will be interesting and fun because not only will they be learning but I will be learning with them as well. Which will be a good thing for me. I look forward to attempting this wonderful endeavor. It shall be fun. Indeed, it will........
