He's a good advice giver... very blunt though. *sighzZ* Blunt is a good thing. Let reality hit me and let me deal with this. Good strategy, Wil.   Anyways, I guess I know what to do but I'm just afraid. Talked to my unni and I guess it's full-steam ahead with that. Please pray for me. I need the LORD's guidance through this... and probably patience, faith, and all that.   Nima, I love you.  Blog later. Maybe.
