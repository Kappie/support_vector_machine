Got all of it finished except for my history outline and none of its due till Wednesday so yay for me. Also had a game tonight. I had an awesome defensive game. Helped post the shutout for our goalie as we won 5-0. Mike Symons got a hat-trick by the way. We also made the playoffs on the out door team. Now only if my In-House team could win. We lost 6-3 last night. But I got a new stick and pants after the game so I didnt feel to bad. Love my new stick. Anyways Bye.
