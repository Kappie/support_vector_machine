My exams finally absolved (predictions: Maths - E; English Literature - B/A; History - A; Politics - B/A; Law - B/C), I enjoyed a joyous trip to London yesterday, complete with illicit substances, good music, oh yeah and a farcical minibus ride to nowhere! Richard and I arrived at the coach station at around 7:30 AM, only to discern that the ticketing office was closed. After panic, confusion and a jot of "oh fuck we're actually not going to end up anywhere", we waited the arrival of the coach. A minibus appeared, and the driver told us, in a stern and frankly-a-bit-obnoxious tone that nobody would be travelling unless 16 people were willing to go to London on the minibus, as the coach itself had been overbooked. We opted into volunteering for the minibus, and were the last two aboard, only to discover that there were only fifteen seats. The driver then helplessly chirped that I should stay on the minibus and Richard should wait for the coach. Well, it was a largely painful and unaccommodating ride, sat on a miniaturised seat, against a six-foot-something, twenty stone black fellow who habitually would stretch out his leg, forcing me half-off my already overcapacitated seat. Richard and I kept in contaxt via the nefarious art of the text message, which was painless. However, worryingly, once we arrived in London's vicinity it became glaringly and incensingly obvious that the driver was totally clueless and was utterly unaware of where Victoria coach station aboded. Richard arrived in London a good hour before I arrived at Victoria, via alighting the flummoxed moron at Trafalgar and catching an Arriva. With exception to that Carry-On-esque incident, the day went very well, Richard was suitably pleased with Camden, and our transactions went according to plan, got a lovely Hammer and Sickle T-Shirt, which I proudly sporting now. We had a very deep conversation about the world on the coach home, pertaining mostly anti-capitalism and communism, it's nice to know that our views our so parallel. I think a very fundamental part of my ideology now is anti-capitalism, insofar as that capitalism is inherently exploitative of both workers and consumers, in its profiteering. Workers because in a capitalist system it is requisite for people to participate in order to live, and consumers because the system articially fixes prices of essential items so that corporations can make a profit, and because the human psyche is exploited through the barrage of incessant advertising to hammer logos (for brand recognition purposes) into peoples crania, not to mention that this advertising malarky has meant that acceptance and success in society generally have to equate to material posession, which means that ordinary people not only have to participate in the capitalists game for sustenance, they also have to do so for gregarious purposes.   I think that I am forming a budding branch of my ideology, based on the principle that we live in a capitalist system, and so we need to work within the system to achieve a fairer world, and ultimately the world which we desire. Non-participation (however ideologically appealing this may be) is not an option, for obvious reasons, and so pragmatic and perspicacious capitalism, such as making donations to extreme-left parties, buying inexpensive clothing from non-branded producers, supporting fair trade organizations and positive decisions about who you buy what you need from are needed. I think if all were better enlightened about these issues, and opted to starve the large corporations from the funds they so desperately need to by buying from small producers, charity shops and unbranded companies, even if these means more personal cost to ourselves. We need to educate the apathetics and political non-participants. As I stated to Richard yesterday there is something fundamentally wrong with our current system and way of life, it is hollow, frivolous and superficial, not to mention directionless. Have a nice day.

Oxfam rule! Yay for equitability!
