I've never done this before; it's a totally new experience, kinda like when I took up country last summer :-P  I blame it all on The Matrix.  Jay had a copy of the soundtrack for the first and second ones (and I'm anxiously awaiting getting my hands on the third!); I liked the movies, so I had him burn me copies.  A few of the tracks on there were semi-techno (actually, my FAVORITE type of techno is the classical-techno mix, but I'm having a hard time finding more of them than were on the soundtrack), and I absolutely loved them - perfect driving music.  So anyway, hoping to find some more like what's on the soundtrack I jump on Kazaa and download a few more tracks from the artists who did them in The Matrix (btw...I love Don Davis, he's the next John Williams).  Unfortunately, I don't find a whole lot more like what's on the soundtrack (i.e. the classical-techno stuff), although Aphex Twin had a couple of ones that were pretty close.  But some of the stuff I downloaded was more hard-core techno (if there is such a thing), and one day I just highlighted all the files I had downloaded and started playing them while I was studying (I figured I should listen to them sometime if I downloaded them!).  I startled myself - some of the stuff I liked.  Now I have to admit, my prior exposure to techno was pretty much Enya and the like (i.e. unfavorable to me!); but this stuff was different, it was cool.  Not something that I would listen to all the time, but good study and driving music.  So needless to say, having the obsessive compulsion I have to further expand upon something that I like (especially when it's FREE to do so :-D), I ventured upon downloading more.  As you might guess, this is cyclical; right now I have no idea how many files I have on my computer.  The point of all this mindless miscellany is...well, I'm not sure, something about me suddenly liking techno (to a degree).  Oh, and if anyone knows about any good groups with the classical/techno (or classical/rock) mix, let me know about them!  Ok, back to studying.  As Homer Simpson would say, "I am smart!  I am smart!  S-M-R-T.  Doh!  I mean, S-M-A-R-T!"  :-D
