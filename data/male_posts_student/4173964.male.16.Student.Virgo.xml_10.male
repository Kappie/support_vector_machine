I posted earlier (I've since just outright deleted it) how I "adore" you and the usual mushy puppy love crap (why oh why won't she like me *barf*) and have come to the realization that it's all bullshit. It's not worth it. I can't keep thinking in the mind frame that we could be together, that we could be something we can never be. It's too much for too little. Why am I literally laying awake at 2 in the morning thinking about all the things I want to say to you when in fact it's all just hormones. I don't love you, how could I barely fucking know you and am never gonna get the chance go go anywhere beyond that. It's not even the age thing, if that was ever a factor. You're just not what I thought you were. When I met you I saw everything so differently. I can remember the first time I saw you. I thought you were the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. When you started talking to me it was merely icing on the cake. I could never see anything ever again and be happy forever with merely that image of you in my head. And for a time we were happy. Fuck me I'm making this bullshit into some kinda motherfuckin soap opera. AND NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED!! IT'S ALL IN MY FUCKING HEAD!! I honestly thought what I felt for you was love. I've never felt anything so strongly for another human being as I did for you. And somehow I managed to trick myself into thinking you might feel the same. I'd pretend a sudden glance or a grazing of our hands was some kind of signal from you. Who the fuck was I kidding. GOD and now I'm mad at you for not doing a thing. What the fuck is wrong with me. You didn't do a thing except not be attracted to me. Not that I can blame you. Even I'll admit there's only so many farts one person should be allowed to emit before they become bio-hazardous. I don't even know what the fuck I'm trying to say here. I guess I just want things to go back to the way they were. Before I felt this, before all of it. I just want that moment in the library back. And I don't want to weird you out either. I only hope these last few weeks can be spent as friends not as two people too uncomfortable to even be around each other due to some phantom conflict that shouldn't have been there in the first place. For some reason I feel like that Robert Frost poem from the outsiders relates to this.  Nature's first green is gold, Her hardest hue to hold. Her early leaf's a flower; But only so an hour. Then leaf subsides to leaf. So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay.   I feel like our first moments were gold but then something happened whethere it was me or you it really doesn't matter. We can't ever have it back...nothing gold can stay.  Whatever fuck it.You'll probably never ever read this but whatever. I just needed you to know how I felt and that you don't need to worry about giving me the wrong signals and all that bullshit Christine fed me. No i'm not mad at you either so don't go getting all...Christine-y. Hey so when's the cast party?....heh heh.... yeah bye
