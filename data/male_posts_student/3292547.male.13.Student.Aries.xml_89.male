Wasn't pleasent sitting in the dark up until 11-12.  The finishing touches are being put in my room. Not much more left to do. Glad for that because school starts Monday. I have a lot more room so it seems, and the bed it pointing a different way. Anyway, not much more to talk about. That's pretty much all I've done straight through the whole day. Anyway, back to talking to people. See ya!
