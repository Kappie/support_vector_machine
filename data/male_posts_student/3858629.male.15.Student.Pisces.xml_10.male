However, I feel like I need to introduce myself as that's traditionally what we do in a first post. Why though? Isn't that why we have these web-journals; so people can get to know us?  The introduction to me is the body of postings that will occur here. If that's not sufficient and learning about my favorite movies and what not, read my profile. That's why those handy-dandy things come with the amazingly rennovated Blogger.  For the record, mainly generic thoughts will go here along with re-caps of my days, various song lyrics, quiz results, and that sort of general thing. I have a private blog for all that deep, personal stuff. It's doubtful you'll ever be able to find it, so don't even try.  Here's to many insightful moments yet to come.
