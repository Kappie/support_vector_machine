DO HOMEWORK IN CLASS. in the words of my cousin eduardo, a college freshman this year, "dude, you'll always have a stupid class. just do it in that... and in class, so you hav a free day for the rest."   thats really all there is...and all that "dont procrastinate" crap...which acually isnt crap...grr.   ive decided on starting water polo...not cuz its the sport for dorks and rejects, which it isnt so much, i am a relatively ok swimmer, and anything having to do with water i will eagerly jump to,...of course there is a rope holding me back, that i call "speedo"   this rope has moved however (up to my neck...), making me realize that i have to DEAL WITH IT, or of course use the religious modesty excuse to get something as skintight *shudder*, but at least like shorts grr.   and i have also decided to do swimming as well, just cus its...swimming!   i went to zachs house last saturday, for a "night of scary movies" which, while the movies werent scary, was not dissapointing. we first started it with the bad seed, a 1956 movie which apparently was the story of a little girl turned evil,....very black and white, not scary.   then, we watched the shining, based on stephen king's book, which is pretty great, if mildly freaky, and VERY confusing...im still figuring it out,...and trying to get redrum out of my head....then we watched identity >   The Bad Seed:  its black and white. there is no more to say.    The Shining:  freaky, very random, and very weird. great movie.    Identity : fantastic, to say the least, a great twist ending, and a very violent movie, if not so scary.
