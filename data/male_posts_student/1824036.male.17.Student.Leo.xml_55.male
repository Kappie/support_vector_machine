We used a  urlLink .22 Lever Action  and a  urlLink .22 Pump Action . We also bought a  urlLink .22 US Survival Rifle , but my dad didn't like the color (silver) so we decided to return it. Me, Joel, and my dad shot off 200 bullets at popcans, pennies, pop boxes, and birds. Then Brian (my sisters boyfriend) decided to join in on the fun and we shot about another 100 bullets with my dads Browning .22 semi-automatic. It was fun shooting that gun. You could just go rapid-fire and hit the pop cans and blow them to pieces!    Yesterday Night   Joel had gone home, we had polished up the guns all nice and neat, and then I was bored once again. So I went out to Joel's and helped him clean up their horse, Ernie. (Ernie is owned by Sue Skow, she ownes  urlLink Sue's Arabs and Pintos . If you want a horse check this out!) Ashley was there and she got all wet and was mad. She pouted until Joel and I decided to cheer her up. Joel and I got this funny-as-heck idea to have a pushup contest. Joel won (cuz his dog was chewing me apart when I did mine). Then we dicided to do some chin-ups. I won, no contest. After that Joel, Ashley, and I decided to play some frisbee. Joel is pretty good. After that we all went out to eat at  urlLink Pizza Hut . I called Jadie and she went with too. After all of that I got home at 9:00 and had Chemistry to do. :( NOT COOL!!! I was up til about 10:30 doing homework (Chemistry, US History, Cellular Biology [incomplete], and a little math) Speaking of math I have some to do...I had better jet!!!
