Tomorrow, another movie. Ah, what a stressful life I am leading.   On Saturday I will be exercising my vocal talents with Karaoke at a friend's place. Fortunately the only audience will be people who have already seen me make a fool of myself!  Tomorrow is an interesting day for me. It is several different occasions, all in one day. In no particular order, it is: my brother's birthday, the third anniversary of my baptism at HBC, and would be my fourth wedding anniversary. So, with all those things on that one day, I guess I'll be on a bit of an emotional roller coaster tomorrow. Already this evening I'm starting to feel it, and intend to keep myself busy tomorrow.
