At first glance, the band appeared as though they had just clocked in at the plant.  They grabbed their tools and went to work creating a unique sound that combines the working class with an elequent touch.  The impromptu set list, for lack of better words, was wicked hardcore.  In plain english, the show rocked.  Not to mention these guys are some of the nicest rockers you'll ever meet.  I got my picture taken with them and spoke with all of them after the show.  I even exchanged sweat with some of them.  A Perfect Circle, Tool, They Might Be Giants, those were all great shows.  But there is something awesome about a small venue with all your friends (or at least all your friends who bothered to show up).
