My allegiance in the NBA Finals lie with the Los Angeles Lakers whom I have been a fan of since 1983 (for those who keep count, I was 2 years old), during the time of Kareem, Magic, and Worthy. At that age, I thought Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the coolest guy ever. If I was alive in the time that the Lakers played in Minneapolis and had George Mikan at center, I would have still been a Laker fan. Although now they are based in LA, thus their nickname bears no meaning, and I do not watch the NBA as much as I used to, I am still a Laker fan.  Last night, my judgement was somewhat questioned. How could I love the Lakers, but hate the New York Yankees? I am writing now to answer this question. First of all, it is not hypocritical to hate everything the New York Yankees stand for, and still be able to cheer for the Los Angeles Lakers. This is because the Yankees and the Lakers are not doing the same thing. It is a fact that both teams have the best players have the best players that money can buy in their respective sports. It is also true that they are both very dominant in their respective sports, but as my math professor says, which I think is apropo in this situation, "there is more than one way up the mountain". In which case, the Lakers and Yankees despite having these things in common, are not the same. First of all, it is not the Lakers' fault that Gary Payton and Karl Malone wanted to join them. The Lakers did not come off as a team who's ownership had unlimited monetary resources (like the Yankees do every off-season). Payton and Malone joined the Lakers because they felt with the recent history that the Lakers had, their best chance to win an NBA title is with the Lakers and in order to accomodate them, both players took a pay cut. If New York Yankees owner, George Steinbrenner ran the Lakers, he would have paid Payton and Malone more than they were willing to accept. To add to this, Steinbrenner would still try to get more free agents so he could buy the title. The Lakers clearly earn their championship if they win it (or at least they earn it more than if the Yankees win theirs).   So, why do I hate the Yankees? First of all, I've hated the Yankees for a long time now (even before I moved to New England). I guess it's just the New Englander in me that amplified my hatred for the Yankees further. Secondly, I feel that one exhibits no class when they become too greedy to the point that they will do anything to be successful, a class-less act like buying a championship. Championships are earned, not bought. You can buy a championship, but what's the point of doing so? it isn't worth much if you buy a championship. The Yankees have that habit, and the players who play for the Yankees have no soul. They just play the game for the money. They should be playing for the love of the game, not material wealth. Another thing I wish to address is the warped concept of "team" that the Yankees have. First of all, a team is not a bunch of individual that do their own things. A team is not just the sum of its individual parts. There's more to it than that. There is some sort of a family attitude in a team. The Boston Red Sox are a team. They are close and work well together, and off the field, they might even be friends. The Yankees are not, and will never be like that. it is one thing to pretend that you're friends with Derek Jeter in front of the media, but it is another thing to actually be buddies with him. Right now, the only friends that the Yankees players have is their money. Something about that is not right. The Yankees players have no soul and once the cross over to the world of Yankee pinstripes, they will forever be known as soulless androids who make millions and millions of dollars playing a kid's game, and playing the game for all the wrong reasons.   The Lakers and the Yankees are not the same. During their respective off-seasons, Gary Payton and Karl Malone chose to join the Lakers, not the other way around. As for the baseball off-season, the Yankees traded for A-Rod because they wanted to spite the Boston Red Sox, who didn't find the need for A-Rod. A-Rod, to some extent, probably played a major role in this whole spiting the Red Sox thing as well (you can call me paranoid, but I believe this to be true).   In the case of both teams, I have long decided what side of the fence I choose to stand on. I have pledged my allegiance to or against certain teams when I was younger, and I choose to continue to stay on the side I chose when I was younger. I'm not being a hypocrite. I just explained it to you.
