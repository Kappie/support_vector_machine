It outlines some pretty sci-fi sounding but real technologies that can be used for mind control (some already are being used that way pparently).  One that is being installed right now on vending machines in tokyo uses hypersonic sound to beam a message directly into people's heads so it sounds like the noises are coming from inside.  and he talks about drugs that either improve or inhibit memory.  and about how the government might force people to use these drugs involintarily.
