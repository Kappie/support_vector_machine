Bottom line is I made myself get up late for service which was at 630 when I woke up at 601 and said that I'd blame it on tata. Pati woke me up at 638 and I felt pissed at tata then myself. Rushed to church to catch the ending of sermon on rooftop and closing hymn. He lives He lives... Needed to dance Hi-5 for children but was chicken and didn't have red shirt. Solved that with prayer and Jon Yap respectively.  Reached home to find pati not being there but at church. Took cab to church to get key from pati. Took cab back down. Wrote pati a letter saying that I'd take her to new Zealand and that I loved her so so so much. Went to RSYC and did practical powerboating. Am very good at rescuing fallen people but am unsure of own ability to dock the craft. Did theory after that.  Went back to pati's and left to do medical at holland's silver cross. Had to wait long time so went and sat at starbucks to do reading for tomorrow's GP test. I'm sitting in front of it right now. I have 41 pages to cover and page 22 is still staring me in the face questioning my priorities. Did the medical and came home to B.P.  Now on to the dream. Hazel was in it as usual. But this time, it was weird. We were in some shopping centre looking for the toilets. Couldn't find one so we ended up in this dimly lit faintly petrol smelling basement-carpark. How convenient. Toilets were there. Walked towards the toilet doors and I kissed her on her cheek and told her to meet me outside when we were both done doing what had to be done which was what we had to do. I went into the toilet and felt damn weird lah. It was pissy and crappy. Didn't like it. Got spooked when I saw this damn sinister looking dude standing in the corner, half facing the wall, half facing me. My appointment with mother nature could suddenly wait. Tried to get out but toilet door had no handle. Frantically groped at the upward rafters while he turned his sly face toward me and drifted in my direction. He slammed me about all over the place and I was screaming Zel's name in the hope that she might hear and come and help. She didn't. Then he flung me to the ground and I was damn terrified and crying and all. Then he stood with his crotch above my knee and started pissing. I could see the black of his pants getting darker and soaking onto the brown cargoes I always wear. I was glad he was pissing on me. At least I wasn't gettin stabbed or nuthin... None the less, I was still hysterical. Yah... That's all... I think he was the devil.  Now that I've written about that, I think it wouldn't be appropriate that I talk about Hazel. I tried talking to her today over MSN, but we didn't talk much. I'm afraid of talking to her when we meet too but I still love her all the same. When we talk now, it feels cold, heartless and detached. Like.... I'll finish this in my next entry lah. I need to let it out. Later
