In any case, there was some kind of rally yesterday on the Capitol steps about how voting machines are unreliable. Kind of a mini-protest. Some of the signage was pretty funny. One sign said something like "Believe the Chad" or "in Chad We Trust". They must have been counter-protesters.  The argument is that our current machines are unreliable and electronic machines, at a cost of around 28 million dollars, would take care of the problem. Wrong. It would be an insane waste of tax dollars. First of all, electronics and Senior Citizens don't mix well, as evidenced by a DVD I recently bought, a 4-pak of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton movies. The DVDs, obviously targeted to their original audience of now-old people, came with verbal instructions on how to use your DVD remote control, and how, at any time, you could return to the main menu if you wanted just by pressing the "title" button. My DVD remote doesn't have a "title" button. If I'm old, I just hit the wall as far as watching "Steamboat Bill, Jr." is concerned.  Am I concerned that old people won't be able to vote? Not really. I'm just illustrating that upgrading voting machines isn't going to help people vote. If a person can't master the skill of tracing the arrow to the hole and pushing the pin firmly in said hole, will the electronic voting machines help? No amount of money can help some people.
