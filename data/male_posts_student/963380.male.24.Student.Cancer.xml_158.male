I met him about a month ago when I needed my prescription verified - he's the one I talked to about LASIK to begin with.  Today I went to see him and I'm seeing better than 20/20 in both eyes. My right eye is slightly itchy - so Dr. Alfano sent me to the Waterloo centre again just to make sure. There wasn't anything wrong - it's what they call an epithelial defect - however I appreciate him taking the time to make sure - better safe than sorry as the old adage goes. I've been told to up the frequency of my lubricating drops to every 15 minutes - with the way the BION tears feel I have no problem with that. It's a very pleasant soothing sensation. The antibiotics and the anti-inflamatories are now four times a day - they sting less now.  I had to tape these enormous plastic shields to my eyes last night. Surprisingly I had no problem sleeping in them at all. I looked like a bug, but hell, for better than twenty twenty? I'm in.  I'm off to go juice my eyes again and them I'm going to listen to a few more movie commentaries. W00t
