Blah...today in history, did anybody notice the guy sitting next to Martin Sheen (Mr. West Wing President) in the jeep?   Vernon Dursley (Dudley's dad) from the Harry Potter movies  , hello...wow, people who actually liked the movies didn't recognize him...or maybe I'm just making stuff up. I don't know. Chem was lazy...  Blurry played on the radio!   Score. Nobody got even halfway in the lab, but that's par for the course, considering Sykes is our teacher...lunch, no basketball, but something "important" about Melissa is permeating through the daily gossip. So obviously,   I have no clue what it is  . Mark my words, I'll be in the know...I'll hear the "inside things"...one day...*shakes fist like Erik*  PE, I think I have shin splints...in any case I got scored on again by Randy when I should've blocked it. Parisa and Basho are kinda strong actually. (Oh yeah, sweet goal Basho.) Ankur's definition of cool: being able to   sing along to obscure Michael Jackson songs  . Oh well, there goes my chance...Jennifer was pimped out in track, she had the whole Chinese school shirt (honestly, it was nice), fly Nike kicks, and track bag look going...meeting her   daily prerequisite of hotness  , no doubt. Belinda tried me in a quick one on one, repping for Warwick...it was tough, but I managed to come out on top at the end...Thornton pride :-D We got our track clothes today (I wasn't last...soph privileges baby!), I think they kinda suck though. I'd even be willing to shell out my own money for them. $60...hmm, that's what, only   2 years' worth allowance, give or take  ...not so bad...
