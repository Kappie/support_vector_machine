It was pretty akward, just standing there while countless amounts of girls screamed and yelled as they sobbed. I knew her through middle school and freshman year. i used to talk to her all the time. I havent said a word to her in like 2 years though, so its not all that tragic to me (personally).  anyway, on a better note, airsoft was awsome yesturday. we have a pretty big group of people that play with us. its awsome. there are a few more things i want to get airsoft wise, but after that i am set. i love airsoft, just the feeling you get when your sneaking around, or in a huge ol battle.  sunday i hung out with christian. after church christian brad and i went to jack and the box, then back to "martians," glens small group thing. so that finishes, and we decide to go swimming. christian and i go to christians to pick up our swimming necessities, and we tell brad we will meet him at his house. about 15 minutes later we pull up at brads. nobody home. with a little frustration christian and i think maybe brad thought we were meeting at the hyatt (where we were going to go swimming). again, no brad. we call up a few people to see if brad just happened to change his mind without telling us. nobody has seen him. now its gettin a tad weird.  christian and i think a bit, and the realization comes into our heads that we were the last to leave the church. brad was the very last one there, everyone else, including all staff, etc were gone. we had stayed much later because of martians. so christian and i head back to the church. we find brads car. it is in the same parking spot as earlier. crap. we figure brads car broke down and he is walking home or somm. so we check all possible roads leading back to monterey.  for almost 3 hours christian and i looked for brad, calling coutless people, going to all the corners of central coast california. after we had checked everywhere about 5 times. we decided that there was nothing more we could do. so we went to cory overtons house where there was a overton / hugo / potter BBQ. that was fun, and about 6:15 we all headed over to glens going away party (yes glen is LEAVING).  so we arrive, and there is brad, sitting on the couch. AAAGH! apparently he had walked over to the Posts house which was not very far after his car had broken down. we had no idea they lived close. of course brad doesnt call. oh well. so glens going away party was fun. short and sweet.  so after that mike and i went to salinas to visit tyler working, and then stayed at my house. tyler came too after he worked.  anyway. agh. school is almost over! i want it to end, but i HAVE to get a VERY good grade on my chem final if i want to pass the class. so that should be not very fun. but nevertheless summer is almost here! yes!  warcraft 3 works on my temporary computer woowoo.  current predominant sex: male current rap star: omar alvero
