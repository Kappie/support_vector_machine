Nothing on tv either.  I had the most juice ive ever had in my life while in Reno.  I remember getting like a sobe and arizona tea twice a day and downing them in like 10 seconds cause i was always hella thirsty.  Today just did summer school again was a little late cause i really didn't feel like riding my bike there.  I broke my record of 20 mins riding my bike home, i did it in 13 mins, tommorow ima try for 10.  Doing pretty bad in basketball right now i dunno wtf is up with me, i have 0 energy and all i wanna do is sleep all day.  This summer was supposed to be my worry free, great and fun summer but its my worst and i can't wait till next summer when i can be fillin out papers and stuff for college then finally leave.
