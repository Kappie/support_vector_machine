I need some shoes for back to school, so i got these white ones for thirty dollars and they are pretty cool. We ate a Chic - Fil - A. Then we went to see Spiderman 2. This is my third time, and it was still a GREAT movie. Probably my last time seeing it until it comes out on DVD but thats cool. Then we went to the Boynton Beach Mall and i picked up mine and Ryans warped tour tickets. Its official, im going and there are no conflicts about it. Brittney finally convinced her parents to let us stay almost the whole time which is GREAT! Yeah, that was basically it, except i got grounded from electronics (Im sneaking on now) So yeah... tommorow im getting a haircut. Im gonna cut it spiky again. Im worried about disappointing my mom but she says she wont be. I know better than to believe her, but if i want to continue my new quote of life "You can only go buy what you are told." And shes telling me she doesnt care... so, lyrics, and goodnight.   Story of the Year  Anthem of our Dying Day   The stars will cryThe blackest tears tonightAnd this is the moment that I live forI can smell the ocean airAnd here I amPouring my heart onto these rooftopsJust a ghost to the worldThat's exactlyExactly what I needFrom up here the city lights burnLike a thousand miles of fireAnd I'm here to sing this anthemOf our dying dayFor a second I wish the tideWould swallow every inch of this cityAs you gasp for air tonightI'd scream this song right in your faceIf you were hearI swear I wont miss a beatCause I neverNever have beforeFrom up here the city lights burnLike a thousand miles of fireAnd I'm here to sing this anthemOf our dying dayOf our dying dayOf our dying dayOf our dying!!!For a second I wish the tideWould swallow every inch of this cityAnd you gasp for air tonight!!From up here the city lights burnLike a thousand miles of fireAnd I'm here to sing this anthemOf our dying dayFrom up here the city lights burnLike a thousand miles of fireAnd I'm here to sing this anthemOf our dying dayFrom up here the city lights burnLike a thousand miles of fireAnd I'm here to sing this anthemOf our dying dayOur dying dayOf our dying!!!
