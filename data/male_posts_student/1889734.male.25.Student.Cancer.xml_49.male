All the more reason to seek energy independence.  Until we can cut the cord with the Saudis, we will have a difficult time reacting to these developments.  I don't believe the world can allow a nuclear power to rise up in this region.  Israel exempted of course.  They share western values, and we have nothing to fear from them.
