I'm going to ask for another one, and hope I don't get in too much trouble... -.-;;   Ah, and then I found out that "hey, I have to get all of History Day research done by this Friday and I barely started" and "ooo... I have 43 out of 80 units done... soon to be out of 88 if it isn't already..." and "my site is supposed to launch March 3rd and we're not close to being ready!!" and "omg... just noticed that my sister's and mom's bdays are coming soon, what the heck am I supposed to do?" and "I am so behind~! WAH!!" and "why am I talking to myself?" and "I tired and flooded..." and "mustn't procrastinate any longer..."   And so on.   Well, anyways, despite all that, let's continue: to keane - day's event eh? Are you going to put in the time where you cruelly got everyone worried about you? =.= ... to renae - ah... i see you got those comment thingies now, coolz... to vics - sounds like quite an eventful day... and how the heck can you concentrate on work?? I need that kind of concentration!   ~Chronos
