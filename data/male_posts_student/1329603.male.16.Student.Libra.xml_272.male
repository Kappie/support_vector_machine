So, the Republicans, basically.  Simply speaking, the exams seem to be going pretty well at the moment. I don't want to go into too much detail, cause then I'd find things to get me depressed and stressed over them, and I don't particularly want that.  Saw Zoe while I was doing my paper round and she is looking Ã¼ber-good. With a v.v cool jacket thing, which has a hoody with ears on. Love. Nah, seriously, Zoe = attractive as ever.  And I'm beginning to figure out why I have no luck with romance (putting aside the lack of common sense).  Oh, and a possible band name - Blueshift. Out of the ones we have, that's my favourite, but I dunno. Up to the 5 of us.  Quote of the day: "My clean land, There's one who understands. A friendly soul, Lasting life in your hand."
