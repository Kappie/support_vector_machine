These are bigger to the teams that LOST them, I think.    Of course there's Hasek.  He'll be 40 next season.  I think Ottowa will regret this - maybe they should sign Osgood to back him up!  Maybe they'll ink Ozzy next season, after Hasek's groin explodes with a lethal EMP.  Danton could get 10 years in the murder for hire plot....a sad strange situation.  Heatly indicted for vehicular homicide.  The Snyder family still absolves and supports him.     WHA draft.  The Dallas franchise took Erik Lindros, who promptly stated "only 2 things come from Texas - steers and the steers who like them.  I won't play for them - unless my daddy says it's OK"  Viva la CBA !  My referee season raps up this week.  It's been a mixed bag.  The pay is nice, but the players are juerques.  Only 4 teams - no variety.  I'm thinking of starting ice next season - it's much harder to get certified, but the pay is better.
