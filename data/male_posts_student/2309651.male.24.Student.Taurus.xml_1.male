In fact, most of the polling is not even being reported.  For example, take the question of straight Bush vs. Kerry.  In March of 2004, Kerry lead Bush 48-44.  Now, as Bush's "numbers go to record lows", Bush and Kerry are tied 46-46.  Do the math.  Kerry -2.  Bush +2.  When asked about who the public trustsin  Iraq, where "the President's support has eroded",  the President went from trailing by one point to leading Kerry by 6!  The bottom line here is that the media can say all they want about the President's declining numbers, but I say research the polling numbers for yourself and you will find they are not as soft as you would be lead to believe.  What they tell me is that when push comes to shove in November the public will have to make a clear and definate choice.  The public will soon realize that Kerry offers no real alternitive to anything.  When this realization occurs, Bush wins.
