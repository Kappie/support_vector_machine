Maybe it's funny for a 2 second laugh, but now he's just getting plain annoying. "Blah Blah Russians suck blah blah Girnoble ha ha soccer players dying HEY this is not funny you little punks." Well since you have such good advice on what children now a days should be like, I have some advice for how good chemistry teachers should be like. 1. Before even diving into the subcategory of  Chemistry  teachers, here's a tip for  teachers in general: Enjoy what you do and be friendly around the kids. Seems our little treasure of a teacher doesn't enjoy what he does, since he doesn't even teach plus he hates kids. Here is a man who thinks it is morally correct for a parent to kill his child for being disobedient. Yo chief we're not some third world country who turns to cannabalism for a solution to our problems. Not a good mixture for a teacher. 2. At least know how to add 2 + 2. Good God is this guy's math terrible. Chemistry is alot of math and this guy doesn't understand that a line going THROUGH a little line makes it a *gasp* PLUS sign. Ah, yes, it's not just simply a misprint. 3. Learn to spell. Somehow he can manage to spell Hydrobromicthoriamcrap right, yet mispell proton. 4. Learn to read. Example: Problem A calls for hydrochloric acid to react with sodium chloride. Teacher turns around and writes HCl + NaOH. Now come on. Either he has a problem reading, or he can't remember for 5 seconds what he just read to when he writes it on the board. 5. Read the chapters and make sure the class understands before continuing. I guess our teacher went to butthead academy where he was taught to read two sentences and give us a complicated problem on material we don't know. 6. If you're going to show us an example, at least do it right. I can't count how many times we've been shown a problem with the wrong answer. Then we're all treated to the trademark "What?! Then how do you do it?" Ok. You're the friggin teacher I think you should know how do to do the problems. You did work for the government as a chemist. God is that scary. 7. You're "I'm-Angry-At-The-World-And-I'm-Going-To-Rant-About-What's-Wrong" act is getting very old. I really don't need to hear about how you're jealous of actors and how you don't understand tanning and how Russia and Africa and everyone else should copy us. So if you're going to tell a joke, don't play the role of the angry ignorant white homophobic man and rant about your problems. 8. And finally,  Take your head and remove it from the death grip your ass cheeks have on it.  I think it's safe to say we're all sick of you and your crappy teaching. 6 sections in one day? Come on now. Test every week? What are you thinking. I can't wait until I'm done with this year. So now after that agonizing long post about Chemistry, I shall go now.  Listen to H.I.M.
