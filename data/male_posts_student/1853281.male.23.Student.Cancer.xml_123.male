My family is pretty WASPy, with the wasp type of reserved manners and interactions. Arelene and co. are definately not, and so it was a very new experience to seem my wasp academe dad interacting with the world so freely and easilly. I don't know. It was a little too casual, a little to boundryless. I guess i must have been indoctrinated is WASP because it seems a little too forward and presumptous to me. Sat afternoon went to mum and jan's for a grill out with the aunties and keith. That was a lot of fun. Yesterday chilled with River catching up and then to Karaoke at Grumpy's with Sadietron. It was a good time. Today,the heat is a bit annoying, well not the heat, but the humidity. But, then again, i can never be satisfied with anything, can i?
