Still sleeping when I came. Haha! I had to wait for her outside while she wakes up and get ready. Meow!!  Hmm...I completed everything in Chem until Organic Chem. I am leaving Organic Chem till tomorrow, 'cause I am teaching Wendy. Study at the same  t ime lor. Wendy studied her Geog, something about arigicultural plantation. Moo meow!  Ermm...we chatted quite a fair bit today. Like we always do. This time, Wendy wanted to "enter" herself in the Teenage Magazine Penpal. HeHe. She did that last time, and some people sent in boring letters. Heh heh. I was thinking it would be fun to answer them, so I suggested to Wendy that she give me all her boring letters that she's gonna receive. She don't want to reply ma, so I do it for her lor! Heh heh! I am thinking of different styles of reply in. Diplomatic, sarcastic, airhead...so fun!  I am so awaiting the lett e rs!   After studying, we played MahJong again. I swear that I have the worst luck ever. I kept having the game of waiting-for-one-tile-to-hu, but that one tile never came. Instead, I everytime discard tiles, my discarded tile will be picked up by the other players and I make them hu. Err!!! Wendy, on the other hand, same situation as me, but hor, she keeps winning. She ji mou or pick up tiles from other people. So good! I will never gamble on MahJong. I will lose till very chan.  Today, me and Wendy ate with her Third Brother. Her mother is painting the wall. O.o It's a new experience. Heh. Seriously. Uhmm....the chicken stall changed owners. Now, the rice and soup and chilli flavour is not aqs good compared to the previous one. Sigh!! I brought duck noodles back for my brother.  Hmm..I end le ba...Heh. Oh...wishing the Geog students good luck for their exam tomorrow! May the exam be as easy as meowing! See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
