We visited a D-Day museum, the beaches on which the Americans landed, the American cemetery, the castle-abbey at Mont-Saint-Michel, the city of Tours, and several chateaux.  Most were fairly interesting, though three-hour bus rides seven times a day can be a bit boring.  Especially since I lent my headphones and batteries to others who needed them and only had two postcards.  The following is a dialogue which took place at the Mont-Saint-Michel, the top of which is very high off the ground.  Tour Guide: In the fifteenth century, an architect here loved one of the servant women, but she didn't love him, so he threw himself off the top of the church.  Noah Feldman: Is he still alive today?  Yeah.  That was good.  Also, before I forget, a quote from math a few weeks ago that I never got around to blogging:  "You're an Apple person?  Do you like them because they're stupid?"  Some... stuff happened.  Not the good stuff.  Stuff that I wouldn't feel comfortable blogging, though I'm not at fault or in a position of negativity; if you want to know about it, ask me.  Let's just say I'm really responsible.  And modest.  And I know that won't make any sense since I'm not really saying what happened, but whatever.  Still nothing has happened, and that's addressed to those such as Loren and Melody, but I might have at least a working outline.  We'll see.  Be online, seriously, I don't have any more classes so I'll have like two weeks in which I can talk to you.  So far I've written two postcards, to Mr. Stanley and to Loren.  Rest assured, I'll send more.  Loren, note that since I wrote that several days ago, the game may or may not have changed by the time you get it.  I'm going to keep the song.  Idk, I like it, and it's a pain to start messing with things while I'm in "Europe's Dumpster."  No offense, however many millions of Frenchmen there are.
