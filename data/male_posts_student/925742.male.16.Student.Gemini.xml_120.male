The whole experience lasted less than half an hour, not including saving and loading time to look at special gun effects and stuff. And to play through parts with the most health and ammo.  But anyway... its 282 megs and WAY to short.  Now this kickass dream I had.... nice and long and it had stunning visual effects, as well.  You know... because it was a dream.  It started off with me waking up after sleeping for... 18 hours straight or something.  I missed school and volunteering, so I felt it was time to party.  The next thing I can remember (there was something inbetween there) was that I was like watching this cool thing.  Like a movie.  But it was like Giants:Citizen Kabuto... with the sparkling blue ocean and high green moutains and all pretty like Giants ( god what a great game, btw).  Then there were these people and they started jumping out of the sky in a circular pattern.  It was cool looking.  Maybe this part of the dream was reminicing of Giants and all the 3dmark tests and stuff that look amazing.  Then I was on a plane.  And there was booze.  Then I was in the streets with an ar-15 like in GTA3.  I was killing gangstas and the cops came around.  I ducked under a fire escape behind a box and continued shooting.  The gang kids kept coming, so I ran to the cops and then I latched on the back of the cop truck thing.  Like a paddywagon.    Then I was like watching some fat, Hulk person on an operating table. And I heard this voice say  "He can only breathe through one nostril at a time" Which was weird when you think about it.   I cant remember what happened next.  Now I can safely assume such an intriguing dream can only be caused by the aspirin I took and taco salad I ate right before bed.  Messed up.  A few weeks ago I heard about this lucid-dream controller device that lets you control your dreams, rather than just sit back and watch.  It beeps when you're in REM and lets you know you're in a dream and so you can easily form things.  Like, I don't know.... owning a copy of PS and dreaming what its like to play it. lol.
