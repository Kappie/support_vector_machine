Boy looks hip, good hair day, but has students at office hours, giving him less time to be spontaneous and more time to dwell on hottie taking World Lit notes on one of boy's favorite authors.  Student leaves.  Boy makes move.  Boy loses courage in transit.    Boy at same coffee shop the next day.  Boy wants a second chance.  Boy has courage now.  Girl doesn't seem to realize this.
