day at tennis =/ lost every set i played *sighZ* and guess whos cut at me and pulled my net cable out at 1o3o?!?! =( i reckon i put up a good fight...lost 4 n 2 in the singles...hadto play up a seed cos morgan couldnt play...think he mightve reinjured his left wrist... ahh well..so i hadto play ben..whos like a pretty funny bloke...haha...we were both playing..heaps good when the other was playing craphouse...and fully laughing at some of the shots we came up with =P anyhooz...i came on the court with my raquet..and left it holding cairens...lol..broke the strings of both my raquets in the 2nd set =/ must be hitting the ball too hard =P hahaha..nahz...just bad luck i guess =/ andrea didnt play today..ive got some feeling shes avoiding me..lol..always pulling out..although..she is a notorious lazy bum...always turnin up 3omins late most of the time =/ hehe...at least it gave me a chance to get to know mia...hehe...i thought she was older than me..turns out shes in year 9...at st vincents...where danni was gonna 'go' =/ hehe shes such a nice lil chikka..got a coolies grunt as well =P prolly hits it harder than me half the time with that huge backswing >  hmmm..its a lil sad to see how A1 has degerated through the years..and being part of the degeneration > i remember..back when i was first joined the saturday morning junior competition..back when i wouldve been 10 or so....everyone was fully into tennis...full of energy for it...my first rep match was the annual illawarra vs southern districts challenge interdistrict thing...damn..who was in my team back then...morgan..ryan bellamy (whos the 20th under 18 junior in australia..although hes only...15 haha)...and a few guys i cant remember...haha...anyhooz..i think we got thumped in that match...i'd already been playing saturaday morning for a comp or two back then...working my way up for D grade..lol..thats how many grades there were back then...like at least 30...hehe..back then when zita was just starting to play tennis..shouldntve had stopped missy!! youve got a natural talent for sport..hehe..although you are pretty smart as well =P  i think ive been in 3 or 4 saturday morning final winning teams...and one that lost in the semis >  hmm...by then i had already playing interdistrict for a few years...i think we won quite alot of those...hehe..i never really took my tennis seriously enough..like not that extra level...so slowly saw morgan and ryan and people like them go away =(  thing i hated sO much bout interdistrict was the trials >  the selector people were weirdos anyways...never really chose on the results at the trials... i didnt play interdistrict this year...cos it takes up my whole sunday..and cos you sometimes gotta travel to places like newcastle..wollongong...blue mountains and baulkam hills... i think we missed out on the finals by about a point or two last year...hmm..mustve been the year before then..when i partnered richard in the doubles..pwoarh..we ripped it up...he was the shotmaker..and i was the consistent/fluky guy =P hahaha anyways..yea..we had heapsa fun..i think we came back from like 5-0 or something a few times...but we hadto split up..cos adrian and ryan bennett didnt get along so well..hehe..so i went back to playing with adrian...who i played with the year before that...we play pretty well together as well...that was the year i went thru undefeated in the singles =) yea...too bad adrians mum jan n ryan bennetts mum anna couldnt get along...wouldve been alot easier for everyone...got pretty nasty at one stage...mark sproule was playing back then as well...those were the days...everyone trying to make sure they werent playing or umpiring when afternoon tea was being served XD  hmmmZ..anyways..back to saturday morning..lolz...yea..like when i was a lil kiddo...hehe...back then..i was such a puddler..can actually hit the ball now =P i think we mustve played nexto the A1 peepz back then..when we were in bgrade...playing with the swifts..pete n jenny (gosh..jenny must be one of the best juniors around...well...she was...like what...winning nationals last year...a few years under her age group)..well yea...i remember watching those people and just thinking to myself...how am i ever gonna get into A1...yaknow..they were hitting the ball so well and it was all like pro stuff...hehe..i think i got there in...99 or 2ooo..i did pretty good in the first comp..and went shithouse in the 2nd...and i think i got dropped in the 3rd..hadto work my way back in A2 for a season...came back..ripped it up that comp..and yea..been playing pretty consistently the last few comps to where i am now..now..its...so bad > mumis lil sister was having a convo while playing her match..A1 looks so poor now...blah...alot of the seious people are too old..or...especially the guys arent interested anymore...well..most of the chicks arent interested..so the ones that get into A1 are pretty serious bout it...anyhooz..thisll prolly be my last comp...dont think we'll make the finals...our 3rd seeds are losing a lil too much...and i aint winning that many of my matches..and people keep on dogging... i think A1 might have a lil trouble finding decent matchups next comp...cos alot of people are dropping out..iunno...i guess..cant be bothered getting up early in the mornings on saturday anymore...burnt out from the 7 or so years ive done it... i do enjoy the game..love playing it and watching it...just iunno..sometimes...just cbb anymore...and i pretty much hate singles...i think im a much better singles player...but doubles is where all the fun is =P people just bitch bout ryan bennett now..lol...hes kinda geting what he deserves...gosh..so much of a cheater at times...lotta the guys wanna deck him XD hmm...i reckon ive pretty much fulfilled my tennis 'career' lol...been winning a trophy or something like that every year since 97...beaten someone 6-0 6-0..worst loss is prolly a 6-1 6-0...had something like tennis elbow before...that was when i could barely hit a ball without pain running up through my arm...and when i had the thing with my knee...once where it just felt whacked out..and i was limpin at times...and the other time where being the klutz i am tripped...or fell on the court and took a chunk of skin off my knee..back 2 years ago..scar still hasnt fully healed...been to a few pro tennis matches...the adaidas open...seen kournikova on the court ;) went to the olympic tennis matches...guess ive pretty much had it all...oh yea...only thing is prolly not winning a big tournment..but i never gave myself a chance to do that...and i guess...well...maybe i wasnt meant to win one...well..was kinda thinkin bout maybe going into a few tournments at the end of the year when the hsc is over...but its so weird...i used to be like the youngest playing in tournments and competitions..but now..im like an ancient bum outta my leauge > kinda regretting not taking tennis seriously...maybe if i did...wouldnt hafto deal with this hsc crap...or..at least make it easier =P hehehe..at least i might be able to say ive played whoever...if someone like ryan bellamy or cameron..or morgan get up there into the pros  hmmm..couldntve mised much there...prolly havent really talked bout the behind the scenes bitching and schemin thats gone on....but yea..thats pretty much my tennis career...cant remember that much of what happened when i was young though... oh..coaches...hmm...first coach was greg something..lol...he was aight...but pretty much just a kids coach...wait no..i went to this other thing..but that was for n00bie people..and i could already hit forehands and stuff back then so i changed to greg...although he back stabbed me a few years later cos i left him to go to greg perkins...apparently a top notch coach..never worked that well with him..never clicked i guess...yea i guess hes really good at what he does...and he did teach me quite a bit..but i never really improved that much with him...and then...we went to todd clark..arguably my most favourite coach..gosh...he was like my mentor back then...i improved the most when he was my coach..made tennis really fun...i think there was one time i got him cut..cos i was too shit...and i was fkn cut at myself for letting him down > havent seen him anywhere near as much these as i would like these few years.. after he left...hadto go back to perkins..where i started to suck again..lol..thats about when i got dropped...but we met adrian then..and he let us know bout dean toparis his coach.. and my coach now...hes prolly my other favourite coach...his goal wouldve been to get me back into A1...and yea..he did that..hes the one whos gotten me to keep on improving..i mean..i didnt really have a real 2nd serve when i came to him...but ive got (modestly) one of the best first n second serves in A1...and ive pretty much gotten better in every part of my game...hes always saying that i could be real 'dangerous' if i played more tennis O.o what does that mean..lol...that i can hurt people?!?! =P its been a long road...issit gonna end soon??...  hehe..wow..this has been a long blogg... oh yeaaaa..already said it..but its amys bday today..happy bday =)
