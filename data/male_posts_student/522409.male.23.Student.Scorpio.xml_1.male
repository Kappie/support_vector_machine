(including suggestions for the title) I realize also that the meter isn't immediately clear, but assume that it makes sense with the melody, and judge from there.  -*-*-*-*-*-*-  V1: 	Warm summer breeze blew through the window 	Cooled the sweet sweat of two lovers who were tangled up in bed; 	He was lost in peaceful, dreaming slumber 	While she stared at the ceiling, thoughts running through her head. 	Not so long ago, as high school sweethearts, 	Laying out in grassy fields, watching stars at night; 	Back then it seemed they'd go on forever, 	But lying there right then, she knew something wasn't right.  PC1:	And she laid there trying to figure out just how she'd make him see 	Cuz she knew in her heart this was the way it had to be.  C:	Sometimes a woman needs to leave the comfort  	of her lover's hand, 	Sometimes the melody has got to stand alone 	without the band, 	It doesn't mean that I don't love you, 	cuz babe, y'know I do; 	I'm doing this for me as much as 	I'm doing this for you.  V2:	Next morning he woke up to find her sitting 	On the corner of their bed, her face pressed in her hands;  	Said, "Baby, what's the matter, why you crying?" 	What came next was something he just could not understand. 	She told him bout her late-night revelation 	How she needed to try living by herself in someplace new; 	He just sat and stared and watched her lips move, 	And wondered aloud if there was something he could do.  PC2:	She said, "Baby, there ain't nothing that you've done or could've changed, 	I think it's time some things in this girl's life got rearranged."  (REPEAT CHORUS)  PB:    (REPEAT CHORUS)  (c) 2004  -*-*-*-*-*-*-  **About the Song/Process** This was a first attempt at writing a song for a female artist, in something vaguely resmbling a female voice.  Thanks to the people who provided kindling for this one, and special thanks to Candace for the line she contributed.    Started with a vague story, started brainstorming reasons a 20-something woman might up and leave a comfortable relationship--reasons that might initially seem enigmatic to the guy in the story.  Thought then that I might take it in the direction of Terri Clark's "I Wanna Do it All," but decided against the laundry list of things the woman in the story wanted to accomplish before settling down.  Thought I wanted to write the bridge as the guy's revelation and final understanding acceptance of her reasons for leaving (which still will probably be the way it goes), and then follow it with a chorus specific to the guy, indicating that he chose to take off from the small town, do some growing for both of them, and leave the whole thing up to fate.  Lyric writing instructor thought that was a bit too epic, and I think he's absolutely right.  Decided the opening scene (bedroom, summer night) and some sensory things to include (breeze, sweat), then wrote the second prechorus.  Next day, went to the media center at Berklee and wrote the entire song in the hour before it was due.  A new record. :)
