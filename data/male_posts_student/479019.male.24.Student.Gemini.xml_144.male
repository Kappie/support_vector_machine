The only bummer was with Steff, because she had issues with someone, so she took off. We were a bit worried about her, but she called us back saying things were cool. All in all it was very cool as it usually is when hanging out with friends.   My plans for tomorrow... er today... are work on my history paper and get some stuff started for my Social Science 3a paper. I need to book a flight out to Binghamton on Monday and make some more calls. That's basically my schedule for the next 2 days.  Life is good right now. Full of celebration of the end!  ***
