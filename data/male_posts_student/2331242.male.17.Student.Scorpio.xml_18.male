We saw  The Last Samurai  with Tom Cruise. It was a great movie all around. It included a good story, excellent swordplay, and some nice performances (especially at the end, which is by far the most powerful scene that I have witnessed in a long time).   One makeout session and a short car ride later, we arrived at my grandparents' house (not as lame as it seems, just bear with me here). I introduced her to my grandparents, my aunt from Florida, and my uncle from Atlanta (the one who had been to Iraq) For dinner we had my grandmothers' shrimp and grits, by far the best on the planet. She had never tasted grits before, but liked them quite a bit. She had worried about her english brain locking up but she didn't have a single problem, just as I had promised her. We also watched a little TV, just flipping channels to see what was on. We played along with Jepeordy and Wheel of Fortune.  After dinner, it was time to take her home. She helped me get back to the other side of town where she is staying (my sense of direction is pitiful). She asked if she was going to get a goodnight kiss, and I couldn't even wait for her to unbuckle her seatbelt. We pulled over into a dark area of the street, and had the most incredible kissing experience. After that I met her host family for the first time, and we had a fun little conversation. As I drove home, I couldn't get the stupid grin off of my face. I'm still the luckiest guy in Charlotte, and it gets better every day :)  Not a bad first date, eh? More to come.... JD
