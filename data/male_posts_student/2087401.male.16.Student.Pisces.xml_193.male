Or have one who I actually see on a regular basis.  Unfortunately, I can't bare to have her mad at me during the show, so I have to wait on that.    Michael, at least you do improv.  Mrs. Britton hates it.  She won't do any, at all.  And choosing your own monologue isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially since the character has to be close to our own age and the same sex.  I'm doing Peter Wiggin from Ender's Game, btw.  I like being sadistic and manipulative. Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?
