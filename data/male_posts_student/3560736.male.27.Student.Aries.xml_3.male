Hillary Clinton: "We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good."   No thanks.  A fan of clinton: ""I've never shaken the hand of a president," said Thomas, who added that he had one grandma who couldn't stand Clinton and one who thought he was the best president ever. "Even better than George Washington," said Thomas.   Like his grandma has any way of judging that.  Hillary Clinton agian: Sen. Clinton was asked what she thought of her husband's book. "I loved it," she replied. "You've got to read all of it."   And you expected her to say, what, exactly?   [heavy sarcasm]Brilliant story.[/heavy sarcasm]
