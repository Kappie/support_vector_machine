I'm goin' surfin' cuz I don't like your face. I'm bailin' out because I hate the race Of rats that run, round and round, in a maze. I'm goin' surfin', I'm goin' surfin'.  [chorus] You take your car to work. I'll take my board. And when your out of fuel, I'm still afloat.  My buddies and their honeys all come along. They seem invincible as they surf along. The sea is rollin' like a thousand pound keg. We're goin' surfin', we're goin' surfin.  [chorus](x2)  All along the undertow is strengthening its hold. I never thought it'd come to this. Now, I can never go home. (x2)  [chorus]  You take your car to work. I'll take my board. (All along the undertow is strengthening its hold.) And when your out of fuel, I'm still afloat. (I never thought it'd come to this. Now, I can never go home.)  [chorus]  You take your car. I'll take my board. (x2)  Let's go!
