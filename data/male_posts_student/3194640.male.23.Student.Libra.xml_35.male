I highly recommend  urlLink  Long Gone Before Daylight  . It is an amazing album (much better than the last two,  urlLink  First Band on the Moon   and  urlLink  Gran Turismo  ). If you decide not to buy the whole album (which comes with a bonus DVD, by the way) and go the  urlLink iTunes  route, I highly recommend the songs "Communication," "Live  Learn," "For What It's Worth," and "You're The Storm." Honestly, I recommend buying the whole album. It's worth it.  I thought that  urlLink  Harry Potter  The Prisoner of Azkaban   was the best Harry Potter movie thus far. I really enjoyed the direction of Alfonso Cuaron, though I wish he didn't have to condense certain things and leave out others. Cedric and Cho were not introduced in this film (as they should have been), but I'm sure they will be in the next film as they play very important parts in the book. In spite of that, I really enjoyed the film. It's too bad that Alfonso is not going to be directing the next film.   Word.
