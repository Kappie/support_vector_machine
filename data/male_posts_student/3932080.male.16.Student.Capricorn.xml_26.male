The Salt Lake City Mormon will return home to his 1-year old son and wifeuntil Jeopardy! tapings start up again. Ten percent of his so-far $1,321,660 will go to the Mormon church as a tithe.Sincedropping the 5-win limit rule, the quiz show's ratings have gone up 50%(much of that thanks to Jennings), andhost  Alex Trebek's  sex life has gone up 100%. In unrelated news, Jennings recently complained to a doctor of "jaw aches."   In other news,  UPN  is airing  Amish in the City,  a reality show that will take six young Amish adults andlet them live life in L.A., with every second of the experiment taped. The Amish, likeNative Americans, are a group that are never exposed to the fast American world, the only difference between them beingthat we killed the Native Americans to build cities, while we built cities to kill the Amish.
