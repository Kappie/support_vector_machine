Evan, a energetic guy who comes across as vulgar, meek, and idealistic all at the same time, was talking about some girls a few blocks down at the Crown  Anchor.  I think there was talk about heading over there for the "hook up," which inevitably turns into the "walk over to the bar where the girls are, stand there like jackasses, flail aimlessly with a plethora of witless phrases and quips, and go home depressed because you blew a shot to get laid that you never had."  He wanted to go, and I think white T-shirt Houdini man was interested to, but Trip and I didn't really care.  This stopped Evan from going, but not from thinking about the possibility just two blocks down.    "I don't know what it is," said Evan.  "There's something about girls.  99% of the important decisions I've made involved girls."  I smiled, nodded, probably chuckeled, gave him the thumbs up or the ol' Shooter McGavin "it's okay that you broke my heart Julie Poland" finger pistols, and thought that he was a complete dick.  Who bases their lives around girls?    ---  Putting my mind to it, I think I can list my history of crushes:    Shelley Callahan.  Emily Everett.  Nicole Kruse.  Laura Odeh.  Heather Slinkard.  Stephanie Farrier.  Alicia Parker.  Melia Woods.  Lisa Thurber.  Maura Wilbur.  Laura Fine.  Christian Speegle.  Dana Beyert.  Lauren Jackson.  April Landry.    I expected more, and I'm sure there were more, technically.  But these were the ones I fantisized about.  Not sexually per se; I can't utilize a crush in order to fulfill my self-serving obligations...these fantasies were much more benign.  Compassionate.     Shelley Callahan  -  1st grade .  We were in school together from kindergarten to 6th grade, with a one-year hiatus in second grade.  I lie...third to fifth grade was Carrie Scott, who looked a lot like Shelley Callahan and was basically the Chaparrael version of Ms. Callahan.  But everything started in the first grade, when our teacher Mrs. Scott presented each student with a animal made of yarn and foam called a  warm fuzzie .  Mrs. Scott would give out one warm fuzzie a week, and that week each student would draw the warm fuzzie winner a picture.  I had dysgraphia and was terrible with penmanship, so my pictures were the worst of crayon scribbles and abstract representations of playground games and lunch banter.  Joel Bass, a recent fuzzie winner, was disturbed with my seemingly lack of effort on his picture, and he vowed to exact revenge.  He did when my turn for the fuzzie came up weeks later, and he drew two blobs and a large red X on the page and gave it to me.  Shelley, my table partner at the time, saw this and decided to draw me a beautiful picture of a sunrise with the two of us holding hands in a meadow.  That day I vowed my first date would be with Shelley Callahan.  It didn't happen; she was always taller, and by the time I moved, her breasts had still not developed.     Emily Everett  -  2nd grade .  Emily was the first unique girl I can remember; she never seemed interested in the jollies of the other second grade girls...granted, she was no Anne Woodward, whose ability with crayons and Greg Beaumont's package was unsurpassed, but the blonde with the ponytail and no-nonsense attitude was just sexy in that second grade way.  At one point in the year, we set up a square dance, where the second grade would all perform some sort of hoe-down for the school, and we broke off into teams for the dance.  Well, I was not a hot commodity for the dance; not only could I not draw, but I sure couldn't dance.  So while groups were formed and people paired off, I sat the bench and would sub in for people who were absent.  It meant a lot of dancing, and a lot of watching Emily dance.  I even remember the song that she danced to (join hands now, and circle left around somehow...around the ring you go, keep going, take a little walk on a hill and toe...now the other way back, going single file, girls in the lead going indian style...the boys step around and back track, turn around go the other way back, and pass her once coming back, second time you meet do-ce-do your partner now, and promenade somehow, and sing  The First Thing, Every Morning, and The Last Thing Every Night ).  Anyway, I watched and watched and watched that dance, knowing some day I would make my move.  That move would come on the day of the school show.  I did what any self-serving second grader would do...when her song came up, I stood up and walked into the fray, looking completely lost.  Raul Garcia, her partner, was slow getting up and the music started.  I was caught up in everything, Emily's partner was not in the square, so she grabbed me and said, "Pay attention!"  The next three minutes were glorious, holding Emily's hand during the promenade, looking at the school, showing off the girl on my arm.  She didn't talk to me after that, but she hadn't really talked to me before that, so I wasn't losing much.
