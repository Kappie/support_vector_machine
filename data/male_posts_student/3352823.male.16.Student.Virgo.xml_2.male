So I'm thinking of a new URL, if you're looking for this site next week it means that the thing's been changed... I'll post it up though.  Just got back from school... My feet are drenched because it rained and I, like a fool, walked across the field. To each his own. This weekend is going to be murder. I have so much to do. But I think I can do it. It's mostly just little/big things that are very isolated, such as review for a test (bascially do review sheets), read an entire book (The Great Gatsby) and finish a botany project (naming plants that I've gathered and sticking them in this homemade book I have planned). Wish us luck will ya? AND! I plan on watching "The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King" this weekend so I AM NOT missing that. I wanna watch it with my friend... To see if she'll cry hehe. I should moan about school but I don't wanna. Really there's not that long to go until summer so there's no point. More later, I gotta get started on tonight's homework!
