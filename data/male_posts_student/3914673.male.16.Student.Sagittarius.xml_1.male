According to the word of ear .. :P it was a nailbiting match right till the end, but anyways i need to air my thougts too. Srilanka .. shud have one,  agar they had used there top floor, or maybe they did, but not very effectively. Anyways, Pakistan is a lighter competition than India, I have to say, even though i am a paki. Now I seriously want India to win, so that Sri Lanka realize their stupid mistake of not letting the Paki's in, coz if we wud have been there, they had a chance, now, the road to victory is too narrow.  Anyways this is my opinion on my blog. If you have yours .. comment please..  Ma3salaam LuDa
