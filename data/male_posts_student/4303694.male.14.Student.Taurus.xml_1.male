After that I went upstairs and started that  DAMN book! It is sooo boring but at least I got farther than my friends when they started they  one got to chapter1 on the first day. I am already on the fourth chapter and I've only been  reading for about an hour and a half. Well I don't know what I really feel today. I'm a bit tired   and I'm also a bit mad. Well I am like totally not intersted in what is going on in this family. They    totally don't understand what it is like to be me. On other bad news I totally f***ked up my   green Chuck Taylors. I was writing the lyrics for Ashlee Simpson's Autobigraphy and I messed   up and it won't come off. So now I am going to have to scrub them or put them in the washer.  This totally sucks because now I cant wear them to school with my green and black Knee high  socks:( Oh well I can wear my Phat Farms with my black and white Knee High socks. Well I   guess I'll write more later
