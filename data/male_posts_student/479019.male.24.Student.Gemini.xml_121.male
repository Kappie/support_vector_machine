If I don't hear from anyone by the time of the presale, I'm not going. I want to be down in the pit.  In other concert news... the  Ataris  are playing 4 shows at Chain Reaction. I have to go see that. That's the SoCal punk rock experience epitomized. A pretty good band playing a tiny little venue. That'll be great show guaranteed.   Hmm... I was gonna hang out with Jenny today, but she forgot about other plans... looks like WWE Raw is in my near future instead.  ***
