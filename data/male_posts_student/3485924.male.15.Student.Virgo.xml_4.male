Last day of school is tomorrow and so is Sahil's coolio party that he's gonna have that we're all gonna go to ^^.  *1 week later*  Yeah... the top part there was a draft because I was tired and didn't feel like finishing.  It's been only a week but it feels like a long time has passed.  Lots of junk has happened.  You should all be excited, whoever you all are, because stuff will also happen to the layout of this semi-spiffed up blog.  Oh, the title?  Well, it is (according to james) the ultimate solution to solve all solutions.  Yeah, it was funny and we all laughed for a certain period of time.
