One of them definitely meant to be fast and make people jump, another to be medium-paced (such as "Light the Fire") and another is "darker" I suppose, definitely needs minor chords and a slow tempo to carry it.   Reasoning, "My Life Will Worship You" Designation: 1 of 3  As usual, I started off with one somewhat catchy line... "My life will worship you".. From there it just goes off.. I was just thinking how I want to worship God with EVERYTHING I've got. (Sorta like that last verse/bridge from "M.I.F.", giving it ALL to Jesus.  I'd like to get out of this similar song writing rutt. Once you see all the songs together, you'll see the similar pattern in phrasing the verses and chorus. Hopefully the addition of music will fix that problem. "You inspire me... You create in me" worked into both verses give some continuity and the bridge is just cute and awesome.  Reasoning, "Vision of Beauty" Designation: 2 of 3  Again, the inspiration for the second song came from stray thoughts while writing the first song. This is that "darker" one I was talking about. I needed a little more "down" so I could lift it up abit more in the chorus. When a whole song is on a "high", it can get fairly annoying. Sorry for all the "words" but it's the best way I can describe the change in feel/tone. Took a chunk from "Amazing Grace" and did the ol' darkness into light bit. It works well here I think. Em, Am were some chords that I was throwing around for the verse. The dead senses bit is cool and asking for Jesus to give that new and full life is MEGA cool.  Reasoning, "I Will Sing" Designation: 3 of 3 (though it's my fave!)  Get up out of your chairs! This reminds me of Acquire the Fire, more specifically the song "Shout it from the Rooftops". The band Desperation does a kick-butt job so I didn't want to rip their song off or anything but I think the words, feel is totally set apart. Even the conservative worshipper should like this one. It's about spreading the good news of Christ by not only singing, but screaming, dancing, praising... all dedicated to God. Two verses and a chorus, seems to be the standard for most worship songs. Tells a little narrative through the verses, something I hadn't done before. Also I got rid of crappy repeatings. So I guess progress is being made there. High-tempo, high-energy but a controlled atmosphere for worship. It's possible.. I know it.
