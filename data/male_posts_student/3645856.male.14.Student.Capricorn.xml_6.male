The laws are too strict and it's kind of crazy there. I stayed up till about 4:15 am last night talking to Shelly and watching TV... Don't have any new news really. I haven't eaten since last night around... I guess 11:00 am. I had vegan chili. Today is a fairly beautiful day... but I really don't have anything to do outside. I might go for a bike ride or something tonight. I haven't ridden a bike in... 2 or 3 years. My dad bought a new one a few days ago so he could ride it. Nice temperature today and not a cloud in the sky. ::checks weather station:: 81.0 degrees... anywho, as soon as I get motivated enough, i'm going to pick some stuff up off of my desk, make my bed, and fix something to eat. I need to stretch. George  Mood: Still aching from Water Country, Tired, Lazy. Music: Last listened to "Grace" by Jeff Buckley about 30 minutes ago. TV: Watching American Chopper on the Discovery Channel.
