Me and my mom have been watching movies non-stop ever since school went out. My mom got this little movie-pass thing at blockbuster, and we get as many movies as we want for only $25 a month. And blockbuster will regret it because in 2 weeks we already got more movies that would add up to more than $25. Kool. So yea. Ive been goin to the movies too with my friend. Ive seen Shrek 2, Brother Bear, Somethings Gotta Give, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (again), 2 Fast 2 Furious, Cujo, Monster (awesome), The Thing, Dragonfly, Harry Potter 3, Lord of the Rings 3,The last samari, You Got Served. And u wanna know the crazy part. ALL IN 2 WEEKS! Yea so weve been watchin movies movies movies and more movies. But its time for me to clean my room. Yep. At 1:46 AM. Bye
