It's time to pack our [school]bags, rub our eyes and return to the 7-hours-of-torture-a-day routine. But not everything is gloomy, because there's the prospect of soccer at school! Our team (AGS-13B2) played some fantatstic games last term, winning ALL of our five games. Our best ones were the 7-1 thrashing of Kings College and the sweet 3-1 victory over rivals AGS-13B1. So due to our fantastic record, we have been promoted to the B1 Championship League. Yaaay! It really would be something if we won the championship. I reckon we have a very good team, skilled players in each position and the right team spirit. These factors we will take into account during the season.  Our next game is away to GreenBay High, t will be great to see how that trns out.  P.S. I'm the 'keeper
