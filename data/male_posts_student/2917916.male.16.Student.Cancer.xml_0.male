I ask her out on a date...while at the same time, she is asking someone else out on a date. It just sucks feeling like you're being lead on. For the record...Love is a strong word and I don't necessarily love anyone, so my love for steph is not getting stronger. My like is getting stronger. Mabey I'm not getting led on...ya never know. But the reason I decided to post this is I want honesty...so why not give honesty?  Their ya go.  ~Andy
