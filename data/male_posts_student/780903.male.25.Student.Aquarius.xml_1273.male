The LexisNexis Elite Program was designed especially for our valued LexisNexis users as our way of showing appreciation for your loyalty. As an Elite member you will be rewarded with special perks and privileges available only to Elite members. By earning 2,000 LexisNexis Ultimate Rewards points this semester, you earned Elite status. You will maintain Elite status for the remainder of the semester and, provided you're still an active law school student, all of next semester. I have 3,550 Lexis points, which, my ten seconds of sleuthing tells me, is about enough for 4 CDs on Amazon.com. Any recommendations?
