I am kind of bored since the teacher is not around and have decided to write today's offline blog. 1st of all, Nigel is worried that Pn Norzakia is agry with him. He is also worried that he did not get his PEKA file back. Rosal borrowed Nigel's beloved tie pin to destroy some pens. The teacher just left the class and there is havoc. Nigel doesnt want to be mentioned so much here so he called Kamil over but onstead they started debating about yesterday's issue (just scroll down). Now, I have to play arbitrator on the issue. Kamil wants Nigel to stand out of class, only because it never happened to him before. Rosal is playing football with some broken erasers. *sigh* The football fever is still in the air. Pn Norzakia has been out for oa while and I hope she stays out till recess. ;) "The king" is crapping with Nigel over some nobleness. They are both trying to imitate royalty but I think they sound soooo pathetic. I am looking for more interesting stuff to write about. Too bad.. the teacher is back.. :( Electrochemistry. Staring at Barath doing weird things with his pen. *Dozing off* some anion.. I thought it was pronounced "an-yawn" but its actually "an-eye-on"... Boring.. sleepy.. Yippee! Its recess. Ben wants to be mentioned in this blog so I here it is. -------------------------------------------------------------------- 10.30am Status : "Offline Blog" Welcome back again. It is history now. *Yawn* I expect to be bored. Sathes, Gurpreet, Thines, Sashi and Kanaga are supposed to do some extremely boring presentation. Their charts look dull and I can't read anything on it although I'm closest to it. Nigel just told me how Fletrisha ran away from him when he saw her. She must be shy seeing him. Hmmmm... I wonder why? Back to history.. they copied my group's notes! This is outrageous! At least the judges know the truth thanks to me. ;) Well, who cares anyway. At least I got my decent marks. Its kind of boring.. actually VERy BORING. The class is occupied doing their own thing while Devan is reading his chem book. Some are even sleeping! Didnt know history was tainted with foul language. Well, at least not in the text book but those idiots are rewriting history with not-so-polite language. I'm not paying any attention. Just wondering why those dead people have such weird names like Bustatumin. I see Ridhwan running away from Nag, I didnt know what was going on. After that, Sugadesh was wrestling with Nag over some books. What a pest he has become lately. Uh... there are problems now, we all have to answer the teachers Questions. I could answer the simple question! The class got unsettled when Kamil couldnt answer the question. Well.. there was an elimination game and those who couldnt answer had to do some weird things. Haha! Nigel is saying that he is the best prefect in the world and the head prefect!  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 11.35 am  Status : "Offline blog" Grrr... Its add math now and I dont have my book! I'm going to kill  Keane! Nothing much to say.. its english now not add math anymore. Subject-verb agreement.... HAVE I been crapping to much or HAD I been crapping to much? Hearing Pn Bhawani talk, it reminds me of what David said yesterday. Apparently 4 Hijau likes to stare at her. I will refrain from going into more perverted details here, or I might die if she found out.. 30 minutes and school is over!!! Ben just tried to whack Kamil's forehead. Sanjit is so desperate to be mentioned here that he tried to pull off a stunt. He tried to force "the king" to bow down to him but only managed to whack his forehead twice! ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MATH DRAMA!!! 12.50 pm  Status : "Offline Blog" Miss Mah walked into class late today. She started teaching us about accumulative frequency or something like that. Suddenly Miss Mah blew off her top and started scolding those who did not do their homework. She then forced those who didnt do their work to get out of the class. 30+ students ended up out of class in a few minutes. Now, only Devan, Kamil, Rosal, Sanjit and me are left in the class. Then when Miss Mah checked their work, the others had to get out of the class due to incomplete work. Then Keane walked nicely into the class telling me he gave my Add Math book to Azrie. Now it's only me in the class! WOW! This is great! :) Devan just entered the class. I wasnt expecting a climax at the end of the day. Miss Mah was so mad and still scolding. She scolded Jared for asking her for a pencil. In more precise words "AM I A STATIONARY SUPPLIER!?" Hahahahahahaha.  It is 1.10pm now and school is dismissed. Miss Mah then ordered all the students into the class. Then she locked all of 'em except me and Devan! ;) She left the class and said she will free them at 1.50pm. Students from other classes come and jeer. At 1.30pm the class is almost riotous. Some attempt to break the lock. A sudden appearance of Pn Marriam made the class quiet instantly. At 1.50 pm, I follow Miss Mah from the canteen to the class. They are all begging to be released, they gave reasons like "I'm late for tuition". Miss Mah replied cooly "I coulnt give two hooks a care" or something of that sort. She then made sure she went through their books and made sure each one did their work before letting them out one by one. Those whose work was incomplete had to stay back even longer to do it. 2.15pm, I can't wait any much longer watching this drama. Someone who doesnt want to be named, was turned away a few times before Miss Mah let him out. Voon Ying tried to use Devan's book to show that he did his work but Miss Mah was smarter, she found out. ;) -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Thats all for todays 'offline blog' transcript.  My offline blog seems to be a hit and people like reading it. :D Well after school, June was just raving about some chemistry experiment she did. She was attempting to create her own jewelry from skeletons (Calcium carbonate actually ;) ) and from Lead and Iodine.  Nigel's blog is at http://www.wannigel.blogspot.com/ and he wants 10 reasons why not to hate me.. Can anyone help him? I certainly can't. Now everyone wants a blog after reading mine. Haha... I get to become a trend-setter. I'll add more here tonight.
