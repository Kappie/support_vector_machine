A little advice for anyone that doesn't already know. Do not get in the middle of your parent's arguments, and if you do be very careful not to say anything that could be turned against you.  Which means be very careful not to say anything at all.  And don't make one parent think you are siding with the other because then you are just asking for it.  I think that it may be easier to vent your frustration on your kids than on your spouse. Your parents have a fight and somehow they end up joining forces to yell at you for butting in their business.  I wonder if couples that don't have kids take out their anger on pets.  It seems to be the next logical step.  But what about the people who treat their animals better than they treat their children?  Do they yell at the animals before they yell at the kids? So many unanswered questions.        I don't know maybe I am the only person that gets in the middle of his parents arguments.  I doubt any of you have noticed but I have a tendency to get involved in other people's business.  I just need to butt out.  My parents are right! ( I can't let them know that, of course) I think life would be easier if I didn't care so much about what was going on in other people's lives, but it is interesting, you know.  You find out a lot of stuff about people through conversations you are eavesdropping on.  Not always stuff you want to know but. . .anyway.        Oh, I just thought of something.  Everybody needs a blog.  I have vented my frustration on my computer and not angered anyone. Why can't everybody just sit down and type when they are mad, instead of taking it out on their kids or pets? Because not everybody has a computer.  But if they did you would have a lot of problems.  Computer people would be really busy all the time, though they probably wouldn't mind if they were getting paid. And internet cable service would be really slow.  But even if everyone had a computer they might not have the internet, oops, i'm rambling. Anyway you shouldn't take out your anger on other people.  It just isn't fair.  So next time you are angry, don't yell at your sister or your dog (I would never yell at Belle, by the by) just type.    My new motto:  Don't yell, just type. Nevermind that really sucks.  I am going to go to bed now because I am a seventy year old in a fifteen year olds body. At least this is Gregg's assesment of my life.  It probably is true. Maybe not, it's just something to think about.
