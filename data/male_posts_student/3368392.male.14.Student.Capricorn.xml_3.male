Then he asked "what was the occasioon?" and i told him that there was no occasion. THEN he started going off about how all he saw now-a-days was B's and no A's although he only saw ONE B that was in hoovers that i get every quarter. He started talking about my studies and how i needed to study more during the weekends. how i needed to work more around the house and was the car and.. stuff. he then asked again of what the occasion was for me bringing the flowers to school. when i told him AGAIN that there wasn't an occasion he started talking about how him and mom are already having difficulties economically and that i shudnt just buy flowers for no reason for a girl and then he said that i was a spoiled brat and that was rotten.
