I love him so much and he's gotten rid of my bad mood so quickly just because he's so innocent and loves without caring about faults. I'm so glad I have a pet again. It seems like pets are the only things that can truly love someone, becuase it doesn't matter what you look like or what your faults are. I suggest everyone have a pet. It's one of the best things in the world.  ~Just a quick uplifting~
