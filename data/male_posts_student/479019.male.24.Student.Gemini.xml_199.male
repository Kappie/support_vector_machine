It was really weird to know that it's going to be a long time if ever I see them again. After the meeting, I really didn't want to work anymore. I doubt my motivation will go up at all for the rest of the time I'm there. Knowing that the people I love work with are gone, make it less of a motivation to keeping going.  After work Jon, Derek and I had some of  Stone 's Arrogant Bastard Ale. A nice 7.2% beer in a 1 pt. 6 oz bottle. I was feeling good after a bottle and we all chatted and watched TV.  I feeling more and more the sense of the end being right around the corner in this chapter of my life. It's... not sense of excitement or sadness... it's just a weird feeling.   Well... work in 7 hours. Time to get some sleep.  **
