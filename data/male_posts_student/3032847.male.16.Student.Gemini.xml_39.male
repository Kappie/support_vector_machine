With MR Smedley (my business studs teacher from schools husband)! and he knew my name :-O probs because he's drove me to the metro centre, done business studs revision classes with MRS. S., and that...  As I say, a good chippy. I can see myself settling in nicely there. They didn't have a box of them little wooden forks you use to stab ur chip wrapper with when you're done though, which was mildly appalling. I also had a photography and chemistry lesson, I like the kinda laid back feel round the place. Meh, more about this tomorrow.  Tonight me mam was putting cable tidies on the wires round the back of the telly. I handed her some scissors to cut the left over bit of tubeing off the end.. and she cut through the live cable to the video. Hmm, big explosion, bad smell, lights flickered, metal scissor blades had a HOLE in them, she shit herself practically and sat there in shock. Remember to always check what you are cutting through before putting scissors to use, kids. Anyway, I put a new fuse in the plug, soldered a new cable to the board inside the video, put new fuses on the board, screwed it all back together (2 hours work)- it's 18 year old! Should have seen the DUST :-O Yeah it's working fine now :-)  Ummm, more about whatever tomorrow or some other day. For now, go  urlLink join the new european (german british french austrian albanian spanish greek etc. ya know, European)! teen blog blogring webring thing  and, I'll.. see ya!
