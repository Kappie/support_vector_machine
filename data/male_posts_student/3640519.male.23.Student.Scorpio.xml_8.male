Well, it so happens that breakfast is served in the MEGA MESS (pun intended) from seven to eight-thirty , exactly that time of the day when the lure of the bed (the right kind) is at its peak. And therefore you need a resolve to coerce your conscience (I believe it is still alive) to make you drag yourself out of the sleepy bed.       At night, from nine to eleven I was reading a book on Economics by a Harvard prof. Believe me when I say that, unbelievably, the book is light reading. All those fundaes about the invisible hand guiding buyers and sellers in the market, why the goddammed Commies turned pauper, why you shoud trade with the U.S., why Tiger Woods should not mow his lawn, why it was right for Kobe Bryant to stay semi-literate... all those fundaes seem really cool at that time of the night. Gradually but surely you feel an invisible hand dragging you into Dreamland (no connection with M.J.).       All this while a great variety on creatures, which would put Animal Planet to shame, try their  level best to break in. Lizards looking for some non-veg in the vegetarian heartland of India, all sorts of oddly shaped moths,flies,roaches waiting for their final fling before putting an end to their irritating existence. After youhave put up with this and Economics for an hour and a half you decide to put an end to their futile struggle.TCLICK, the tube's off.and in the darkness you grope to find a place for your specks and then it is off to fantasy land ---- with, not to forget the resolve you have made to wake up for breakfast.(Although, Kacker, no pizzas with Oregano(whatever it is) await me).       It's not the sun but the brightness outside that pulls your eyelids open. You try to bury your head into the pillow but then your conscience kicks in, pricking you and prickng you till you decide enough is enough and boldly step out of your warm, no hot, bed and look at the timepiece. It strangely shows eleven o'clock and you curse yourself and try to kick yourself in the butt. The you start noticing things, the seconds arm is not moving at all . Hah, you pick up your wrist watch and lo, it is seven fifty. Enough time to stay true to your resolve. And you have done what you had failed to do for weeks now... Waking up early enough for breakfast on a Saturday morning.
