I played risk.  My dad won, he beat me and Tom, my twin really bad.  I read the book The Slippery Slope by Lemony Snicket  A certain person that i really wanted to date told me that she wants to just be friends. I'm totally ok w/ it. :-) (its really ok maggie if ur reading this)   I'm boerd and the dinner mom is cooking smells good  g2g, ttyl, ttfn,  -Danny
