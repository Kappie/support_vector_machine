Now, the question - where is that going to get you? - implies that an Arts degree is not going to "get" you anywhere.  The person posing the question cannot see an Arts degree being of any help in your life - specifically, they cannot see a commercial application to the Arts and therefore they espouse the concept of Commercial Value being the central driving force behind the concept of "usefullness".  I have now formulated the correct response to this question.  If asked this question or a version of it, take a six inch hunting knife and gut the individual who asked you.  I have no doubt that as they are making what must be a very painful attempt to hold their intestines in place, they will probably ask you a second question: "Why did you do that?"  Your answer should sound a little something like this:  "Well, I have just come to realise that the study of the humanities is an exercise in pointless, useless drival.  As such, following your lead, I have thrown anything and everything to do with the humanities out along with my humanity.  Now, the study of the Arts is the study of human culture, language, history, philosophy, theology and few other things to boot.  It is these core values and ideas that inform, construct and underpin our society including the laws of humanity.  Now, it stands to reason that if it is not going to 'get' me anywhere studing the humanities, then the humanities are an unnecessary hindrance to my life and so, now, after an epiphany brought on by yours truly, I have thrown out anything to do with the humanities so I can become a Commercially Viable Individual.  Naturally, the law 'thou shalt not gut other members of the species Homo Sapiens' is not based on Commercial Viability but on an idea of human worth based in the ideas of culture, morality and ethics as studied and used in the now defunct foolishness of the humanities that you and I don't believe in.  I have gutted you because I need starting capital for my drug empire and I'm going to start with the contents of your wallet.  So you see, it is Commercially Viable and therefore legal for me to gut you."  Then, to stop their screams, I'd advise injecting them with heroin bought with the contents of their wallet.  This has the benefit of getting them hooked on drugs that they have essentially paid for and now you have the beginnings of a client base that will last you for the term of their natural life.  Should you ever end up in front of a judge, plead temporary insanity based upon a delusional understanding of society being a purely Commercially Driven Institution, brought upon you by the insinuations of the victim.  Happy hunting.
