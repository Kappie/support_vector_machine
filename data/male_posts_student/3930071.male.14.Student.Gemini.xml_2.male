I had put up so many offers at  urlLink www.gmailswap.com  that i thought I would never get an account. Now you guys can email me at  urlLink buminabox618@gmail.com  . Since I know how hard it is to come across one of these GMail invites and I know how much some of you guys want one, I will give my invites to the first people who comment. I do not have any invites at this moment but I will be recieving them soon. I will write your email down and email you an invite as soon as they arrive. On other news, there are some talks of Edgerrin James coming to his hometown Miami Dolphins, that sounds good to me. Also, Lance Armstrong wins his 6th straight Tour de France, congratrulations to him i apreciate what hes doing to help cancer patients.
