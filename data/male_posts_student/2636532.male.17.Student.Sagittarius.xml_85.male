I was at West Edmonton Mall yesterday (the worlds biggest mall, it has all the stores in a rainbow, sometimes two, and in certain cases 4 or 5) but as I was walking along I saw a real live reindeer, santa's reindeer at that! And for a mere 10$ you could have your picture taken with it. Like if that's not a great deal I don't know what is? Course there's always pictures with Santa that can cost anywhere from 10 to 60$. Alright enough of that back to my other bitchings. As I was sitting down to rest my feet, because that fucking mall is huge and you spend more time walking to a store then you do in it, but as I was sitting there I noticed some punk dressed people walking by and very loudly mocking the "trendy" people. Alright, so what? I make fun of them too. But then they go as far as to say that they should try to be more original like them. Alright? They're ORIGINAL by dressing punk? Wouldn't original mean that they'd be dressed like nobody else is? Did the millions upon millions of other people that dress punk just disappear? What a strange phenomena that is? Like an entire group disappearing so these people could be original, or an entire "trend" I should say because that's really what punk is, it's just another fucking trend, no matter what your style is you aren't fucking original unless you made the fucking thing yourself by hand and no one else on the entire fucking planet looks the same as you. So any goths or punks or skaters, preps, or cowboys out there who think they are fucking original go shove it because seriously you aren't, you just copying millions of other people out there who did it before you. And for you people out there that say you dress the way you do to rebel against pop culture and the "machine" that is society go fuck yourselves, that only works when the trend first appears, not decades later when no one really fucking cares anymore. You want to know what kind of statement people should make when they wear clothing, comfortability, not fucking huge ass bling bling (those big chains and medallions that people where), no fucking spikes, fuck high heels and ties, fuck dress shoes and suits, fuck corsets and every fucking thing that's uncomfortable! God damn it why does everything that you "should" wear to impress have to be uncomfortable? fuck everything! Next time I go for an interview I'm showing up in sweats! I'm never fucking working someplace that won't let me be comfortable on the job! I just realized that this is probably the longest blog I've written in a long time...I do get carried away when I start to bitch. I'm all blown out of steam now. -Matt
