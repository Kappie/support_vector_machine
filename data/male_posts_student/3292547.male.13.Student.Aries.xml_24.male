And that one   This can go on for ever   And that one    Rain. That sums it up. Besides thinking about starting a blog just for pictures, and besides playing my game and praticing for Graduation (The 20th. 2 days) nothings happened. If you get anything out of my today it'll be a miracle. I might post some news here and there though. You never know.
