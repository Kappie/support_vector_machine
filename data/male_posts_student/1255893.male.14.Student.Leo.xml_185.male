From craving after things, or clinging to thoughts, which never truly satisfy.... born from our unrealistic images of life.... life being impermanent, and interconnected, yet we try to make out that it isn't. Nevertheless, every human being can free themselves from such continual dissatisfaction. How? By recognizing the truth we resist facing, and taking steps to actualize that truth."
