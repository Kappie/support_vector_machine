I figured that I would write a simple post to tell how much I like it.  True, they are more expensive. True they are sexier.  True they are awesome.  The only thing I can say to people want to argue about price is: I used a Dell Jukebox.  It was junk.  It felt  cheap in my hand.  the sound quality was bad (could have been the music).  Also, it was hard to control and looked a lot like an iPod.  I would have to nor reccomend it to anyone.  Spend the extra 30$, get an iPod...
