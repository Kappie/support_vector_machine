Alternatively I could do my German homework, answering about 15 boring questions, but I'm not going to do that either. Yet. Then there's that thing called 'revision'. Generally done in the weeks proceeding rather important exams. But you guessed it, I'm not going to do that either. Yet. But then, what is there left to do? Well, I believe that I will be going to the cinema later today with my older sisters to see 'Scooby Doo 2' which could be good. The first one wasn't too bad. Ok, the ending was predicable and the same as always: *pulls off rubber mask* 'It was the manager!' 'Yes, and I would have got away with it if it wasn't for you damn kids' 'So it was you who was frightening away the customers with you costume so that you could smuggle these goods!' But hey, it'll make my sisters happy. I'll do a review of it tonight when I get back.   So, I check my MSN contacts list and discover there are only 2 people online, fairly good friends from school, but I haven't really got anything to say to them. Megatrobe has supposedly gone on holiday for a week, (not quite sure why I said that, it's not as if you care is it?'), and I'm stuck in my house for all of the Easter Break. Not that I'm complaining of course, rather here than at school. Suddenly I remember: I have 2 business studies practice exams and 2 physics practice exams to do over the holidays. My, that will be dull. Ah, someone else has just signed into Messenger. A slightly better friend than the other 2, but I still have nothing to say to him. My God, I'm bored. Just had a look at DickyBods blog. Hey, you forgot to put a link to megatrobe's and Steffie's Blog, as well as the 'contact me' link. Also, please inform me of where you got the code for that Matrix thing. Please? Inspired by him, I will also now include that sig he used at the end of each blog. Ta Ta.
