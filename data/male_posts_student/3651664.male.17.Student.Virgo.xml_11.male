Bush lied, war is bad, etc. So, your alternative is to turn around and vote for John Kerry -- a liberal who, if only on certain days of the week, has portrayed himself as against the Iraq war (remember his DNC speech?  urlLink Refresh your memory  ). Now he's come out and said that, even knowing that no WMD's would be found, he would still have voted to give Bush the authority to use force against Iraq (  urlLink From Reuters  ). Make much sense? Didn't think so.  There's a new documentary out, funded by the RNC, all about Kerry's conflicting statements on Iraq. Apparently, it's already surpassed Fahrenheit 911's opening weekend viewership. Rudy Giuliani, the 9/11 hero, has been quoted saying, "Every American Should See This." So go see it:  urlLink www.kerryoniraq.com   Have a great day.
