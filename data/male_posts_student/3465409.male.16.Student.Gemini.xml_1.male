My favorite movies are the LOTR trilogy, with my favorite of the three being the 3rd and last one. The ROTK is the only the 2nd movie to make over 1 billion US dollars, $1,117,602,779 to be exact  urlLink (http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2003/LRDR3.php) . With that much money you have to think that it is movie that has made the most money but it hasn't. Somehow, Titanic (1997), made more. Titanic has made over a billion US dollars as well, the first movie to do so. It has made $1,835,400,000  urlLink (http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1997/TITAN.html) . Now that a lot a money. Now granted, ROTK hasn't been around for as long as Titanic, but still, how does a movie about a ship that EVERYONE know what happens to, make so much money? Anyone who doesn't know that the ship sinks must be living under a rock, no offense to those people who do live under rocks. And Leonardo DiCaprio is not that good of an actor. While both Titanic and ROTK have won the Academy Award for Best Picture, ROTK well deserved it, but Titanic, not to much. Now I'm not trying to make people who like Titanic mad, or trying to say that Titanic is a bad movie, just that I can't quite see how it made so much money and won Best Picture. ROTK was the better movie by far and I hope that it makes lots more money than Titanic has in the number of years that it has been out.
