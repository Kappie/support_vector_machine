       
      I got two questions....   1.) what is everybody reading for their book?  2.) Ms. Clark, i'm an idiot! I started reading my book (THe Picture of Dorian Gray), and started to get into it, but i realized that its taking place before modern times.....  (Oscar Wilde died in 1900) :-/ urg... i'll have tin find another book.. is that alright?
