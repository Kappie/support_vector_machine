Basically, the name Benedict comes from the Latin word Benedictus, which means blessed. It was originally intended for my cousin, who was born earlier than I was. He was a premature baby, and was expected to die but he survived in the incubator. Since he was born in a hospital, which holds the name of St. Anthony, he was named after it. The name Benedict was just passed on to me, who was born 6 months later. So here I am, carrying the word blessed in my identity. As many people may have thought, you will expect that I would be a very religious child but not to that extent. Since I carry the word blessed in my name, I always make sure to be in a good relationship with the Lord; and I think this is the reason why I receive a lot of blessing from him. I think “blessed” is appropriate to me for the fact that God has always showered me with lots of wonderful things. This is why I am very thankful and grateful to him. To live out what my name means, I always make sure that God is the first in my life. I try to spread his words through being nice to my family, helping my classmates in their problems and singing with the choir during mass. As my music instructor told us, “He who sings well prays twice. Those who spread God’s words with the use of our talents like singing and who play an important role in the celebration of the mass are special to God and thus, more blessed (meaning receiving a lot of blessings).”
