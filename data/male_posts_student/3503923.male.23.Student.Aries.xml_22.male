       
      When you've been broken, broken to pieces And your heart begins to faint 'cause you don't understand  When there is nothing to rake from the ashes And you can't even walk onto the fields of praise  But I bow down and kiss the Son  When the Rock falls, falls upon you And you get ground to dust, no music for the pain You opened the windows, the windows of heaven And then you opened me and crushed me like a rose  But I bow down and kiss the Son  Let the praise of the Lord be in my mouth  Though you slay me, I will trust you Lord  Kevin Prosch 1996
