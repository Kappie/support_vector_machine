Not a bad day, per se, but an unlucky day.   I spent about an hour last night trying to get a videogame to work - it took approximately three minutes to find out what was wrong and about 57 minutes to download all the necessary drivers. Rogers blows goats for drug money.  I woke up this morning to the cool sounds of "Lean on Me" as broadcast by my Microsoft Plus! Alarm Clock. I got up and hit the snooze button, which apparently turned the alarm off altogeter and I overslept slightly. Following that I got up, feeling quite unrefreshed and groggy and stumbled to the shower. Whilst in the shower, my towel fell in and promptly soaked itself, expressing to me that wet was truly the nature of bliss for all lifeforms towel-like and also informing me in one fell swoop that it cared not for my opinion on the matter.  I made a disc with the crack for Generals for General Paton. I left that at home.  Following that there was an accident on the way to work, through which I got jammed into a block of traffic. Late for work.  Robbie's DVD player that I sold him yesterday is defective.  On the upside Jeff got his 5.1 digital audio for his Xbox, I purchased a silly little Nintendo Card game, Lui had a baby boy named Brayden (well his wife did), Simpson's still a fucking moron and we're about to go get Junior Bacon Cheeseburgers(tm)
