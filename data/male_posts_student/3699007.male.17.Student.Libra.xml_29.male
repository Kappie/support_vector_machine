He taught me how to use the computer program he uses to write estimates, but I cannot look at a car for the life of me and know all the parts on it.  I'm not gonna go into detail on going to work with him because it isn't very exciting, so I'll just skip to what we did next.  Since my grandmother (on my dad's side) only lives about 5 mins from where my dad works, we decided to go make a surprise visit.  She made us lunch.  God it was good...steaks and potatoes.  It's always great to see my grandmother (either of them) because they seem to love you and find good in you no matter how bad you suck at life or whatever.  Not saying I suck at life, but grandmothers in general kick ass.  We stayed and chatted with her for about 2 hours.  It's always great to hear the stories she has to tell.  She definitely hasn't lost any of her memory.  She gave me some money and a ton of candy too, so that wasn't bad either.  Then, we came home and I've been here since.  Britt called me tonight, he is home and we're gonna do something tomorrow.  He still wants to go clubbing, but I fit about as well in a club as a vegetarian does at a BBQ cookoff.  I really don't wanna go.  That's not what we're doing tomorrow anyway.  Tomorrow (meaning today, 7-6, since I haven't gone to bed yet), we're going bowling again since it's $6 for 2 hours unlimited games.  Ok I'm tired...talk to y'all later.
