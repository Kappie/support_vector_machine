You see, there are people who have free time.  Then there are people who have a lot of free time.  Then there is me.  People like me are the ones who have nothing but free time.  So, I decided that I can post more often now and that I might actually stay on schedule.  Well, you might notice (probably not though) that I changed some stuff in the layout.  There shall be more changes once I decide what I actually want to do.  It's really not that hard.  The people at blogger made it so easy to change everything.  All you need to know is some basic HTML (and some not basic), and who doesn't know that ^_^.  So... um... yeah...  It's quiet here.  *twiddles thumbs*  Lalalala...  Wow, I really DO have a lot of free time.  Oh well, lets get to talking about something that can be semi-interesting for people to read.  Yeah, I'm handling no FFXI pretty well.  I just went back to what I used to do.  Play lots of other games.  I'm really into Kingdom hearts and this online Zoid MSN group, that's fun.  I got a pretty little Sabrelion (for those of you who have seen the show).  Kingdom Hearts is really fun.  I actually used to think that it was a stupid game, but then I played the game and saw that it's just as good as people have said.  I'm at this annoying part though, so I haven't played lately.  Tonight I'll probably get ot play it at Sahil's house if I bring it.  I'll also play some Metroid Prime if I can borrow it from Alex.  Ooh, and I have to play FFX again.  I was thinking of playing FFX-2, but I'll see.  Hmm... This ranting business is getting easier as I go.  Maybe sometime I might start updating more often (don't get your hopes up).  Well, I'm off to talk to Ricardo some more and maybe go play some FFX-2 (the game might not be the best, but I just wanna know the story ^^;;).  I'll see you all on Sunday :P   ~~(>^_^)>
