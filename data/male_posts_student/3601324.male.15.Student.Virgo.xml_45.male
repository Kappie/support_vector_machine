I still got some pretty pictures though. I'll post them here if I can get the digital forms.  Sunday, there was some anniversary of some aunt of an aunt that I don't really know. But I didn't have to go. Thank god. OLD PEOPLE  SMAAASH .  Then, Monday, my uncle who's in the navy came home. But my grandparents don't know, because it's a surprise! OMG, the secrecy. Anyways, he'll be staying here till Saturday when we throw my grandparents a  seeecreet anniversary party  of their own. That might actually be fun, because apparently, I get to take pictures and video tape stuff. I'm  so  doing commentary. :D
