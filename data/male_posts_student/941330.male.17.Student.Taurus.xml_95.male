ALe X c53: Ankur needs to get a front door, the cable company cant even hook him up no more? This shit im doing righ there is gay, say...would you wanna eat some hay!!!! BY THE BAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TODAY!!!!????  then they left cuz it was late and alex had to leave around 8 am to go to la today. then i talked to jill, who's off to vegas for 5 days but cuz she's only 19 and broke she's got absolutely nothing to do. we talked about late night shows..."what did you expect me to do at night? sleep early?" and TMI and stuff. apparently we're supposed to get MAJORLY obsessed with the opposite sex in the coming years. we'll just have to find out shan't we? talking about it beats doing it, right...er...whatever. yea, she's probably the person i most like talking to (when she actually responds relatively promptly lol)...like, cuz she's a cousin so there's less awkwardness, she's in college and likes politics and news too -- common interests that transcend age and gender...er...yea -- so i can say the tongue-in-cheek things other people wouldn't understand (which kinda keeps my mind sharp). i can really say what i feel like saying to her, and she doesn't condescend or go "ummm...right..." and i guess she can seem like a big sister at times. i've always wanted someone like that...someone just a few years older who's been through everything and i can get actual firsthand advice from. i can bowl better than her too, which doesn't hurt. :D  cousins are cool.
