After the funeral we went to see my great aunt and great uncle who live in great witley. It was great and they kept feeding me food, also i got to see all of cliffords birds :) Oh yeah i found a '4 star mary' albumn in my house i think it belongs to my dad so im listening to it now. I lost my Miles Davis Cd though im soooo annoyed. Today and yesterday has been so great seeing people i dont normally see and just generally having fun, i guess im never going to feel like this again after we get back to 6th form so im going to enjoy the pressureless bliss.  Im going to go and perpetuate my dreams now buh byes!  Tom
