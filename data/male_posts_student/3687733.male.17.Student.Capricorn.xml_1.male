PS-as the name of the blog reads......everyone's invited.comments always invited.i would throw it open too,if i could.interests are mainly books,and loads of music.technology also,and surprisingly,politics also!!NOT interested in posting my weekly study schedule on my blog,thats just for sheer losers.
