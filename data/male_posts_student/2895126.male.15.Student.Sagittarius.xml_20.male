Michael Newdow, who challenged the Pledge of Allegiance on behalf of his daughter, said the court has no choice but to keep it out of public schools..."   I'm sorry, but this seriously, seriously annoys me.  What if I, as a Christian, decided to sue because I thought  this  was offensive? I'd be laughed out of court. Well, actually I'm not sure. Rehnquist seems annoyed by this guy too. (Thus another of my phrases can be used:  Everything evil starts in California. )  Another thing that annoys me is that these people say that a government that allows the concept of God to be so horribly  forced  upon their children is a "theocracy." What about public worship places? Should we disguise them so that our atheist population (not so large, by the way) isn't "offended?"  What's so horrible about this? We are "one nation under God." Most of America  does  believe in God. Does the very  mention  of God force little atheists to convert? I don't think so.   I just hope the Supreme Court makes the right decision. Leave your opinion on this matter as a comment.   The average person thinks he isn't.   (Fr. Larry Lorenzoni)
