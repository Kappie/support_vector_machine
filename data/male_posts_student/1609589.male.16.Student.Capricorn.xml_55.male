It's at http://blunttruth.jaazsoftware.com/index.cfm  It gives you a bunch of personal prefrence questions about the person who you're taking the test about (Am I lazy? How is my smile?) and you have to put an answer as 1-10.  I call it the guilt-trip test because whatever answer you end up putting makes you feel guilty for putting it. If you put like a 5-1, you feel bad because the other person will feel bad about themselves, if you put 6-7 you fele guilty because the other person will feel they're not good enough, and if you put 8-10 you feel guilty because honestly, their smile isn't that great (im not talking about any 1 person).  But seriously, this test was made for selfish insecure bastards who have nothing better to do than wonder what other people think of them. Me? I say if you don't like me, go fuck yourself. It's your loss. I really don't care. My friends are the coolest people in the world, but if you don't like me, cut the crap and tell me and get on with it, because I don't want to be friends with someone who hates me.  Like, for instance, if there are any of my christian friends out there that are only being friends with me in the hopes ill become christian, go fuck a cheese grater, i dont want that kind of friend. But if you USED to only be friends with me because you hoped i'd convert, then realize that i was really cool and decided to be friends with me anyway, even better! You deserve money.  My friends who are christian are still all really cool, but if you're not REALLY my friend, tough shit, tell me, let me punch you in the face for lying to me (metaphorically or not, depending on if youre a girl or not :-D), then get on with your life..  That's my ranting session for today, when i think of something else I'll post back, but I need to head to the airport to pick my dad up. See ya!
