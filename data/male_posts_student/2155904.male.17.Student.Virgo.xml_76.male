It was actually a funny conversation when he looks back on it.  He first told her at dinner and she looked at him with wide glaring eyes and he was like, "Ummm...don't worry it won't go on my record."  Yeah, that was just kinda like, oh shit say something good now.  But then it was all cool cuz he explained stuff and then explained where it happened.  She actually said, "Oh, thats good you got it then cuz I even speed there."  Tyke was like, "yeah...reaaaaaal good."  Well, that worked out for the best.  No problems.  Other than the fact that he has to do community service and such sometime.  But Tyke is going to be very happy when his final tomorrow morning is over.  His 1st period final that is.  Cuz then it means a fun 2nd period final (photo) and then off to rest up, eat, and get ready for his big game.  That is going to be a battle.  But the Quah has a serious size advantage and should also be able to dominate the outside game if they can hit their shots.  Fatigue should not be a problem of course.  This is going to be great.  And Tyke, Kinker, and Toxic Old are going to have the fine cheerleading core of Haras and Purdy there.  It may not be right for them to totally cheer on only the Quah-ites but still they should give some good support.  But the time is tomorrow.  And it is late.  This was pointless to write.  He is not even focused on it now.  He really needs sleep.  He has totally neglected that this week.  Earlier today he fell asleep watching TV in "his" chair and then he had one of those weird moments.  All of a sudden his body shook violently and then BOOM! he woke up.  It was freaky.  It happens occasionally, mainly when napping on accident.  Not sure why it happens.  But it does.  So he is going to try and get some nappy nap sleep sleep.  So wish Tyke luck!  Actually don't need to cuz this is really not a big deal ya know.  Just bragging rights.  And oh will they ever be bragging rights!
