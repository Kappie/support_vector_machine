Anyway, last night I suffered uncontrollable rage. For once in my life, it wasn't about soccer(I actually missed practice). It was about the story I write. I mean I write this story as much as I can, but there are certain individuals that just don't understand the work that is put into writing a chapter of my story. First I have to plan it, write it, edit it, send it to editor, publish it. It isn't exactly the easiest thing in the world to do. So it doesn't make my life easier when people say "Oh, when are you going to write more," "You haven't updated in a week! Gosh!". Well I have had enough of this. Honestly, do these people not think that I have a life. I try my best, but I would rather talk to my friends that I have not seen in weeks that write some story. So if you feel you just can't wait, well too bad.        It got to the point last night where I hated my own story, thanks to people for helping me cure rage (you know who you are).        I would just like to say that I am over this rage and have no hard feelings, so if you feel you are one of these people, don't worry about it ;)        In other news, my birthday is in four days! I can't wait! It is going to be exciting!!!!        Talk to you later and expect new lil friz pictures soon!        Hakuna Matata    Anita
