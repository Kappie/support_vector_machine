I haven't hung out with him in years...or months but still it seemed long considering we used to hang out all the time. We played football, basketball and Halo. It was Keith, Matt K and B, and some other kid I forget who's name. Then Donnyell joined along for a bit. Nothing else at night. Matt came back to my house. He went home at 10. Today I've been hanging out with awesome Christian. He's my mom's long everlasting friend's son and we've known each other since Day 1. We've been playing video games and such all day. Just hanging around my room. What a relaxing weekend. Tomorrow's probably band practice. Uh, Amanda told me to update this so I'm guessing I should say something about Amanda. Uh, she had a dream the other night. There that's very special. She's a cool hot gal with lots of friends. Can anyone guess her name? Does anyone read this thing? That's what I thought. Biotch!
