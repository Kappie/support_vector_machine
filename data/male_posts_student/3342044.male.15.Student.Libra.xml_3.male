It was so like her to die that way: concealed, hidden below the trenches.  There was no suicide letter nor indication why she did that.  Her family wondered as they wept without tears.  I didn’t.  I knew why.  It was because of me.  And now I am here where she breathed her last.                                           ***  	I met Yoshiko a year ago.  She was sitting on my favorite spot, the largest rock by the sea and her gaze was far away beyond the horizon.  It was midnight then and time seemed to stand still.  The wind was silent and the sea was in utmost tranquility.  I sat beside her and as I looked towards her face, it struck.  A lightning bolt to the heart.  She was the personification of nature’s beauty.  Her skin was as white as snow, and her eyes were as black as the night and as deep as the sea.  Her hair followed her like the waves as she glanced at me.  And then, there it was, that sparkle of comfort, that breeze of peace.  	I asked her why she was there but she kept on looking at me, smiling with her lips of dainty red.  She bowed and began to stand.  I held her hand to stop her.  She went back to her sitting position with her sight again on the horizon, but she never let go of my hand.  And when the wind began to whisper, she moved closer and her head found sleep on my shoulders.  	When she awakened, I noticed that tears flowed from her eyes.  I asked why.  Again, her eyes turned towards mine.  A minute had passed yet her eyes never left mine.  Then, she kissed me tenderly, softly.  With that moment of reverie, I felt heaven.  	The flowers were blooming and their fragrance flooded the air.  The sun’s rays were mellow.  I was in a vast field where harmony seemed endless.  The breeze tickled my nose and my lips were soothed by the warm air.  But my eyes were closed.  	When I woke up, she was already down at the beach.  I ran to meet her, for I forgot to ask for her name.  When, I had already reached her, she smiled and said, “Yoshiko,” without me asking.  She told me to meet her next month at the same spot.  Then she bowed, and continued to walk away.  	And so I did meet her the next month, and the month after that, and so on.  Those days were the happiest days of my life, and were also my saddest.  There were times that all we did was to look at each other, and there were also times when we kissed and held our breath wishing our lips would never part.  But there were times when she cried, when she fell silent and whenever I asked, she would just wipe her tears off and smile.  That smile has a lot of meaning, of concealed emotions, and hidden sadness.  And all I could do was to embrace and kiss her. 	I knew it was impossible for us to be together, always.  She never told me what she feels.  She never even told me her life.  It was all locked up in that smile.  And yet, I risked it.  I risked feeling sadness and loneliness whenever we parted.  I risked the thought that all of this is transient and would go away at some time or another.  I risked all of these, for I knew I would never feel like this or love like this, again.  	It was in the eleventh month when she wanted to say goodbye.  She was going back to Japan.  I asked her not to and said that I love her.  Again, her tears.  	Wiping them off, she said, “In that case I will not go to Japan.  I will stay here where I met you, looked at you, and loved you.”  Then she smiled and walked away as the sun cast its final light.                                            ***  	This day should’ve marked our twelfth month and it should be.  I now shudder in loneliness and in tears. In tears by the sea.  The sun’s light is again fading and I don’t know can stand the darkness.  I have risked everything.  Except one.  And now, I will end transience and begin permanence.  I will see her again.  	Her tears belong to the sea and I will go there to wipe them off.
