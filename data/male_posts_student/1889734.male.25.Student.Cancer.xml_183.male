Of course, more conservatives are likely to believe this than liberals.  There are some interesting numbers in here.  Anyone out there want to take a crack at why journalists tend to be Leftists?  Why is it that 85% of the White House Press Core admitted to voting for Gore in a recent poll?  I want to give someone else a shot at writing an opinion piece here, so someone jump in and send it to my email address link to the right.
