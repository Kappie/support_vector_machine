Not as good as an ending compared to a movie like  Seven , but still pretty good.  I got a job this morning so I got up at around nine this morning. That was good. I made some much needed money.  I swear, a heroin addict spends money slower then I do, and I don't even buy anything useful.   I am waste.  I am trash.  I am trash. I am trash and shit and crazy to you and this whole fucking world. You don't care where live or how I feel, or what I eat or how I feed my kids or how I pay the doctor if I get sick, and yes I am stupid and bored and weak, but I am still your responsibility.   I told that to my mom at breakfast when she asked me why I was wearing sun glasses and a bathrobe.   Blue bathroom   +   blue shades  =  L337 ,  right?    Yeah so, I had a dream last night I was eating glass out of a bowel with a serving spoon. Then I told my Grandma that I wasn't feeling to good, and she's like well then vomit it out, you human butt wipe.  So like I tried sticking my fingers in my mouth but I couldn't do it right- I'd only spend five minutes at a time staring at my fingers after I tried to puke.  Grandma was like  OMFG, SAM . So she stuffed her fingers down and BAM, i vomited all over the place.  Then I look down, and what do you know- DIAMONDS.  So like my grandma was all like  w00t!   Then I woke up and my anus hurt.  I'm going to go get some pants on. It's too cold in my house.
