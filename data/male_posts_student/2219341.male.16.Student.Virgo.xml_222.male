I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!  and yanno what i really dont like... people tryin to "help me" or whatever.  i mean its nice at times and can be a good thing.  but when they start takin my life and my feelings into their own hands i dont like that.  i dont like feeling out of control.  GRRRRRRR!  i am VERY VERY frustrated!  bye.
