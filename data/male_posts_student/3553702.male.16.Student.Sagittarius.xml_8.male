To be honest, I'm tired of summer, but I'm not sure I want to fix that by going to school...hmmm...bleh. That's my thought on it all:bleh.  Well, the schedule is looking alright, mostly because they've added a new class to our choices: Guitar. That is the coolest thing I've ever heard of and I 've already signed up for it. So, once a week, I get to go to a guitar class. Awesome.  Well...that's really all there is to say about school coming up. Nothing big happened today when I went to get my schedule, so there ya go! However, I've got some other stuff that's been rolling around the old 'noggin that I think I'll talk about. That's the 'Some More Ramblings' part of the title. Kudos for those of you that were observant enough to already figure that out.  First on my Ramblings List: Books. I've recently purchased (and read) The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger. Its awesome. It's written in 1945, and yet this book curses more than Pulp Fiction! Now, most of the cussing isn't very bad, but its still bad for coming out in the mid-40's. However, the book is really just very interesting because its one of the few books I've ever read that's told completely in the first-person past tense. It tells the story of a 16 year-old guy names Holden who, after dropping out of his 4th private school, has a nervous breakdown. It also includes some very interesting comments on human behavior and what we hold to be important in our lives. Very nice, but there's one bad thing about the book. Holden is the biggest downer in the world: he hates EVERYONE and its hard to not look at people as HE looks at them when you read it. Which...could be bad. Especially if you develop his tongue as well.  Next on the list: Outside Views. I've realized that often, looking at situations from an outside perspective, forgetting about your place in the situation, can help you look at things a lot easier. Its amazing what you can see in yourself when you look at how you react as someone else. And kind of depressing...but if you find it depressing, then you can see that some changes need to be made! That's something I'm trying to do now and I think its going to help me out a lot.  Up next, The Can: No Longer the Can. Yes, the Can is being repaired! It shall be returned to its original truck-beauty, and as such, it shall receive a new nickname...but I can't think of one yet. I'll have to see it in all of its mechanical glory first. Should be...by Thursday. Hopefully.  A New Addition to the Family! Sorry, I'm not talking about a new child or anything like that, I'm talking about Warlock's new ride! I was amazed at myself that I didn't mention it sooner, but Warlock recently came to own a Dodge Neon...with a 4-Disc CD player. That's just awesome. And, of course I have to give it a nickname. Although the Neon is a 'car' and therefore this doesn't totally fit, I will hence forth refer to Warlock's ride as the Warlock Wagon. I'm a sucker for alliteration. Cherish her, buddy!  Final Thought: After reading Beautiful's blog post regarding her views on homosexuality, I left my mind to thinking about what  I  thought on the subject...which wasn't a good idea because my mind tends to wander when I do that. But, luckily enough, I did come to my own conclusions. As a Christian I do believe that homosexuality is wrong, that its a perversion of the Truth laid down by God that sex is for a married man and woman. However, to excommunicate people who have a problem with that sin, would be the same as excommunicating people who have trouble lying, cheating, stealing, gossiping, looking down on others, killing, being disrespectful to those in authority, and a number of other things...so...you see...that's everyone. There is only one person that's ever NOT committed one of those acts: Jesus Christ and he's therefore the only one with a right to judge. Its funny (funny in that sad, ironic way) that we have problems with Christians who judge others for sins such as homosexuality when they're as guilty for just as bad (the Bible says that all sins are equal in the sight of God). Now, does this mean that I accept that homosexuality is a 'lifestyle' and that I'm not going to say something if someone asks me? Absolutely not. But if I believe that I am as guilty of sin as everyone else (which I am) then who am I to come down on them? So, there is only one solution. To love those people as I would anyone else. Again, does that mean that I'm 'OK' with their sin? No...but I'm just as 'not OK' with my other friends sin: because sin hurts us. I'm also just as 'not OK' with my own sin. Its at this time that its good to remember an old saying: "Love the sinner, hate the sin". The bad part about this saying is that people often put it in the opposite order. I should always love PEOPLE, because they are direct creations of God. Now, the things we do...that's a different story.  Well, I spent a lot more time on that than I probably should have...hope I didn't bore anyone with my incessant ramblings. Oh well; that's ok. Well, like I said, school starts next week and I'll do my best to post updates on that often.
