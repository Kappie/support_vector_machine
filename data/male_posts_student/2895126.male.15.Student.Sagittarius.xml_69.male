But what could complete this whole-wheat treat? Only the cream cheese which I love to eat.  But first a tale of how I came to my conclusion  And cast away the pretenders that heightened my delusion. Unwittingly, we were in possession Of a sick pseud, an item of little expression. Low fat cream cheese! It wouldn't spread! The globby tastelessness filled me with dread!  But finally through hardship I persevered And trashed was the imposter, once the truth appeared! Good, fatty, and wholesome are some words that describe The Philadelphia product that fixed my vibe. Put on a bagel, it enhanced it with style; That other junk was never so versatile.  As so this ode shall come to an end. A warning it gives, to those whose wares pretend! Down with the fakeness! Down with the fraud! And up with the real stuff that isn't as flawed!
