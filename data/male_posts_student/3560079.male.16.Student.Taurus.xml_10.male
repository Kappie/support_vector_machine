It's because a song from the TV-show super troupers is on it, but the thing is:  I now there aren't any other good songs on it, so I can't decide whether it is worth to pay about 20$ for just one song. It is Matilda Hellberg performing Ray Charle's - Hallelujah, I just love her(him) so. By the way, It's no good with Ray Charles, it has too be Matilda, she rocks ;).  But does it always has too be like this. "The whole for a piece". That's obviously a thing that the stores can earn money on. I think that there should be a webstore, where you can buy every song as singles, or maybe put together your "own" CD. (You pay over internet, and get the songs over internet).
