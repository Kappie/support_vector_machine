Karate yesterday was superb, aside from the fact it wasn't as hardcore as usual due to the fact we had kids in the class it was very rewarding. I need to talk to my sensei about bo kata ichi, now that I have my own bo I want to practice at home; however, I forget the transitions between certain parts of the kata. Well, Adam and Karen and I are going to hang out on thursday, maybe Adam remebers the kata... I sure don't remember all of it. I haven't done it in three months. Adam and I were also talking about taking a class in japanese sword fighting, sounds interesting. I didn't know such a class existed in the park. I need to work on my abs more, they are getting there but it's a four pack only if anything. Maybe I should ask some guys at the gym how to go about getting a good ol' six pack. I'm actually being good at working at them. Did my crunches this morning with my legs over my ottoman as usual. Sensei neglected sit ups yesterday, a shame that. Karen actually broke a sweat yesterday, so she's getting into it. She says she is going to stick with it as well, good for her. Karen needs to land a job to pay for all it though, and possibly move out and what not. What else do I need to practice... I want to get pinan nidan to the point of perfection. I should be grading within a month or so, would be nice to have a belt that goes around my waist twice. I'd also like to learn pinan yondan, I'd have all five pinan's then. I really should ask my sensei if we could do a weapons class outside sometime, those are so enjoyable. I wonder if people will stay to watch next time. Yeah, working with the bo is very enjoyable. So far it's my favorite martial arts weapon. The tonfa don't look too exciting, ditto for nunchucku. I don't think sensei even has a kama.I knowsenseidoes sword kata's, just not often. Sai's look interesting though, I think I might get a pair of those as a graduation present from some very good friends of my family. Hope their basement is alright after that flood the other week.  It's shaping up to be a busy day, I work for six hours then come home, shower, eat, and head out straight afterwards. I'll probably end up being out to one or two AM, but that's the best kind of day. Productive, busy, exciting and rewarding. Would be nice to be able to drive rather than walk, but that'll come soon enough. I'm really gonna try and start training outside of karate class, it doesn't go as smoothly without anyone there to correct you though. It's hard to see your mistakes without mirrors as well. The only place I have enough room is in my backyard and I dislike training there cause of the presents my dog leaves and the neighbour's kids watching. I also like to kai lots (kai means shout whichfocuses one's spirit) and I don't like doing that in my backyard either. Sometimes I wish I lived on an acerage still, with space and privacy. Room to train and shoot my bow. Well, that's enough for today.  D
