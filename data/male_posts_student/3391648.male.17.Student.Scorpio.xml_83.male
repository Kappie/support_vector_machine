All play an active part in the daily life, decisions and programs of the school. It is a community united by a shared belief in the importance of the following values: Community: belonging together and caring for each other Diversity: respecting and valuing individual and cultural difference Social Responsibility: a passionate commitment to ethical and socially just action Creativity: nurturing a spirit of innovative inquiry and expression Achievement: striving to set and reach challenging personal goals Self-reliance: the self-discipline and resilience required to achieve these goals  You will find that these beliefs permeate and inform everything that the school does.' Oh yes you can clearly find these beliefs informing the school's policy against free speech. 'Nurturing a spirit of innovative inquiry and expression' of course by limiting students ability to express themselves. Brilliant!  In a subsection titled Freedom of expression we get these 'facts' presented to us.  'The college encourages the expression of a range of opinions unless they are perceived to be racist, defamatory or sexist, to threaten the harmony of the college or otherwise contravene equal opportunity legislation.'  This is fucking bullshit. How dare they try and sell new students on our beliefs of social responsibility? How dare they say they encourage inquiry and expression when this is clearly not the case in practice?
