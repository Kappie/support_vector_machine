I certainly enjoyed kickin it w/ you and the crew at Mr. Skyview, and I'd like to commend Divcom for raising 6 g's for Make a Wish Foundation.  Natalya; Fountainhead is Ayn Rand, is it not?  I'll read it if you read AILD and we'll have a two book discussion going on.  Pat, I'm in agreement w/ you about Gatsby.  One of my favorites of the year... I really enjoyed a fictional approach to social commentary.  Not really satire, but 100% effective- a challenge to the alcohol consuming socialites who had lost the traditional values of the turn of the century.  It's a direct insult to those who live that life.  And the whole time there is the allusion to "big brother" with the doctor's eyes.  My take is that although the socialites attempted to cover their moral discrepencies in speakeasies and  private parties, it was clear to everyone what was really going on.  Just a thought, no evidence to back it up, but I think it sounds good.  One month of school left!!!  Love Rob
