Anyways, there seems to be a growing problem there...There isn't enough space for people...usually if I go there on a saturday or something all the seats are taken and I have to wait till some people get up to get some food.  If you havent been there, there is about 15-20 seats there, which is hardly enough to accomodate the customers, but I am not really mad at Bates, there is no cheap way they could solve this problem.  But I think some people should really wise up, notably the stupid asses that feel the need to bring their whole 6 member family to bates and take up about half of the seats.  If you have a large party that wants Bates, do us all a favor and order it to go.  Also, after people are done eating they cannot seem to get their asses up.  I know, everyone should be comfortable and take their time, but think about the people who want to eat and have to wait for people to get up.  If you are done eating please finish up the conversation so we can get a chance to eat.  Anyways, I've written way too much on something that is really stupid.  But it's not like anybody reads this anyways...i dont think...
