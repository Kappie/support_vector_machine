Anyways it was fun meeting my friends Angel and Chris again.  They're always cool.  I took pictures.  They MIGHT make it into MLIP if I feel like putting in Knott's.  I swear the paint inside this one ride is so ugly.  And you can still get high off the fumes.  My friend made a site.  It'll be added soon enough.  It's called Smooth Stop...I won't say anything.  It's pretty good too.  Makes mine look like crap...oh wait it always looks like crap...Well I'm going to find something to eat, Ta.
