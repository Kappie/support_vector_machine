I kept thinking wtf is this all about? I say yes and yesterday I get there and I find that a bunch of us are getting bit parts (well in a 22 minute movie our 2 minutes is actually kinda big) in a surrealist dance movie. Yup, you read that right surealist dance movie. It is directed by a Russian named Vlad and people were dancing in the foreground. (if you ever see the movie look for my orange skinned ipod in the backround.) they have a picture of the (simple) music were playing with the words "slow" written on it by me b/c I kept rushing.   It was fun, but also very, very weird. the cellist was picked to be the main character in the movie (random choice) and had to come in for 5 hours the day before to run along the streets of DC while they tried to get the perfect take. Poor guy. Today he had to fall asleep on his cello (no small feat).   well it was kinda fun kinda weird and I'm invited to the premiere :P look for me as violin player #2
