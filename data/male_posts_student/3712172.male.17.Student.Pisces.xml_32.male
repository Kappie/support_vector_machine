The picture below shows where my bed, and one of my dressers were. Now all the exists is an empty space, with my stereo sitting on the ground. It's kind of depressing since this room hasn't been empty for nearly 14 years...     Unfortunately, my webcam can only take such amateur pictures, that's only one little corner of my room, but, it is the most empty :)     This on the other hand, is my more full part of my room. It's going to be extremely tough to move that large dresser of mine out, but, we can all be mighty strong that day :)  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   Anyways, just a quick update of my busy day! I am going to start painting my apartment tonight, and steak awaits me for dinner *drool* I will post later. Bye.
