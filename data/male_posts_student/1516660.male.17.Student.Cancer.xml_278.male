All the Singnet Broadband users are affected. I sent a letter to the help people, they haven't replied yet....Sigh.   That problem is why I didn't blog yesterday. I don't feel like blogging la..... perfectionist me. Anyhoo, I decided to blog today. So yeah.   SUNDAY   Morning nothing much happened la. Ywah...only afternoon is exciting enough to worth mentioning.  In the afternoon, we went out to Chinatown. Mainly to buy Chinese New Year goodies. Family tradition. HaHa. Woah.. by the time we reached Chinatown (12.30), the carparks and all were so full man! We managed to find a parking space up the high levels of a carpark oppopsite People Park Centre. HaHa. (Oh yes, I saw a gay couple holding hands. Such a rare sight. Gay couples rarely hold hands in public one...hahaha!)  We walked all the way to Maxwell Food Centre to eat our lunch. So fun! We brought some appetizers, like rojak and popiah. I ate century eggs porridge, while the rest ate some claypot chicken rice (got big bowl for 3 cats). HaHa. Porridge was kinda hot...but nice. The claypot chicken's rice was nice too. HaHa!   After lunch, we went to walk around Chinatown lor. My parents looked at plants (they always buy plants for CNY one...and the fruits will end up dropping all over the corridor. HaHa!) and after that, we moved on to the main streets of Chinatown. Ogh boy...it sure was crowded. We stopped to buy peanuts from a 'famous' stall. There was even a Channel U guy filming as we brought peanuts. I wondered if he caught me tasting the melon seeds and peanuts and giving my comments (rather loudly) to my parents about them. HaHa!   Next, we went to Mei Zhen Xiang (forgot the English name le, so I used the pinyin name) to buy bakgua. My brother saw 3 Caucasians buying 5g of bagua. That's equivalent to 1 piece. HaHa. That costs 25 cents. I think they wanted to try how bakgua taste like. HaHa!!   Hm...after that nothing much happened le la. We went back home to rest lor. My parents went out to Sheng Shiong, while me and brother stayed at home to play the computer. We saw a bush fire (extinguished) along our way back. It's in Woodlands area (monday's TNP got report).  For dinner, we went to Thompson Road's Kampong Chicken stall to eat kampong chicken. HaHa. It was okay...unlike normal chicken. The skin is less oily (well, kampong chicken has less fat and cholestrol) and the meat is a bit tight. Overall, okay.   We then went to the nearby Thompson Plaza to buy new sport shoes for me. HaHa. I need a new pair of sport shoes to wear to JC. There's no designs there I like, so I didn't go there. I went to Causeway Point instead. I found a shoe I like in the sporting goods store on the second floor (near where the restuarant is...I forgot the name...). My mother also brought me a pair of sandals, because my is getting very worn out. Moo meow!  I came back, took a bath and went online. At 10+, we opened two bottles of sparkling juice (grape juice), because today is my brother's birthday. Happy birthday to you!! Moo meow meow!    MONDAY   Ayiah, I don't think I shall elaborate too much on getting to school, just that it takes 16 minutes to reach CCK station from my house by my father's taxi.  At the flag raising, I was kinda surprised. It was very automatic lor. Just stand around, and the anthem starts immediately one. Not like RSS, where the principal/v. principle/teachers-in-hcarge have to repeatedly call students to settle down). Woah!      After that, our group went for the school tour. We toured around the school  recongise the blocks and special rooms. After the tour, our clan (consisting of 5 groups) came together and learnt cheers. We even learnt a counter-cheer for another group. HaHa. Then, we went for a break. Lunch break right? Yeah... Ji and Hann was not there, so I sticked around with Ming Yao and his friends.   After that, we went up to the hall to learn how to dance to the song of "Let's Get Loud" by J Lo. HaHa. It's mass dance...and we have to partner a person of an opposite sex. HaHa. I got kinda messed up in most of my dance steps. Too fast for moi. HaHa!  After that, it is time for clans cheering, booing, and cheers/songs learning. Kinda boring at the songs learning, almost wanted to fall asleep le (sorry le, Jonathon. Jonathon led the song-singing ma...haha). We ended at 4. Woo! Half an hour earlier! HaHa!  I reached home at 5+, bathed, ate, watched TV. Bao Mei Li's segment is so funny! HAHA! I even got a nighmare on Sunday that she was cancelled in Comedy Nite! HaHa!   Sigh...I was very very vexed leh... I think more and more of working you know. On Sunday in Causeway Point, I was kinda shopping for work shoes. I became scared that I'll feel sad if my appeal is successful (ayiah...my family also needs the money. My broadband is 3 months overdue...). Yeah. The more I plan, the more excited I become about work....and the less happy I'll become with school. Wendy kinda correctly predicted that I lost all interest in schooling le. HaHa. I also don't want to go to orientation tomorrow. I, again, was not really accepted in my group, even though I didn't do anything. One guy said "I don't want to stand near Kelvin"....... Sigh... I lost all mood in Orientation because of this lor. Sigh... I am very vexed la!   I think I gotta go le lor...so see ya tomorrow. Night blog!
