Not really the most wild thing to do for a man of 25. And to increase the geek-factor by a hundred or so, it wasn't just regular Monopoly - it was  urlLink Star Wars Monopoly . On the other hand, if it's cold and you're broke then it's not the worst way to spend an evening, especially if you're enjoying a few beers and some barbecued meat products while you're playing. I didn't win either game - Lliam, one of my flatmates, won last night and I think (though I'm not certain) he won the night before too. It gives us a break from watching the Olympics on tv - although I'm pleased to say that New Zealand is finally on the medal table - a  urlLink gold  in the rowing for the women's doubles sculls. The Evers-Swindell twins are pretty cute. Broad shoulders, though. Believe it or not, N.Z. is currently ahead of Canada on the medal table - which has two silvers and a bronze, but no gold. That will probably change, though.
