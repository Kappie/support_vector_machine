This week has been one of ups and down. Got screwed over by my potential insurance company when applying for the auto insurance for the car I recently came into possession of. They quoted me one price, assuming I had taken a driver's training course as a teenager, which of course was the wrong assumption. Upon my attempt to seal the deal with the company, they realised the error of their ways and demanded more money from me in order for me to get insured. I can't afford to pay them more than what they were initially asking. Long story short is that I am poor, have no insurance, thus no plates, thus my car remains parked in the underground parking facility beneath my apartment.  On a happier note, it's time I did something important. Let me introduce the world to the woman I love. Her name is Jennifer (Jenny for short) Gay. Yes her last name is Gay. Insert joke here. I've known this young lady for near to 10 years as her father was the former pastor of the church I regularily attended growing up in Peterborough, Ontario. This lady has been a dear friend for about a year, and an intense friend that my heart beats for passion with since late January of this year (2004). Well, our blooming friendship has progressed to the point where I believe that she is the woman I am to marry. (This is not just some flight of fancy, but being a deeply religious man, I believe that this is divine revelation to me) So I love Jenny and she loves me. We want to marry each other and shall some day. However, as in any good relationship we have our ups and downs. So last night was a night that started as a down and moved to an up. I was upset about the insurance thing getting screwed up. She was moody and cranky cause I was across town housesitting (forgoing any social connection with her for the next few days) combined with (dare I say) a little PMS. We talked on the phone for long hours into the night, and the result was that we both lightened each other's loads. Jenny felt her fears of my actions representing apathy / or poor treatment towards her in our relationship slip away, and my day / night was brightened by the action of reaffirming my love to my love. I can easily say that God has His hand in our life, 'cause only he can facilitate communication like that.  So all is well in the land of Rooster and Jenny (although the Rooster continues to rave at all car insurance companies and brokers) and life moves on as always.  I resolve to blog more often, but also realize in all reality that it's a discipline that needs to be honed. So here's to hoping that I hone it sooner rather than later. At this point in time, it certainly makes no difference as no one reads this blog, but perhaps, just perhaps one day, someone will run their mouse through my archives and explore the inner workings of my mind. Now, as to the meaning of Life, the Universe and Everything......  Rooster
