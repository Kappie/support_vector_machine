I met Xing, Jon and Chew Yee at the station around 1145, which was the time all of us were supposed to meet. Amy who felt slight feverish last nite was late, but just that tad late :) so it was ok. But in the end, we all waited for Mei Ling and I guess, we were late again. haha. Right when we entered the tutorial room, Mr Khor started ranting about why we were late, about how unacceptable it is, but since its our first time in his class he didn't mark us absent -grins- I understood my C programming today-yay- and in Digital Electronics class, me and Jeremy managed our practical pretty well too. MsLian decided to call us JJ sinceour names started with 'J' hah -beams-  That was all we had in school and right after that me, Xing, Xian and Imm headed to the South canteen for some lunch. Everything was okay for today, i wasn't showing any of the..pain..that i had been feeling for the past couple of days. I don't know why, but I still smiled a little today, maybe I feel better. Amy, you sent me the song by Sabyia-The second you sleep, and yes its a wonderful song, and beautiful songs are always worth a sigh -sighs- i've been feeling a little drained, but i'm not that far away from the sun, my sunshine.   Me, Xing and Amy actually had a pretty good heart to heart talk last night, and I'm thankful, I found the two of ya (: sure felt good to churn out everything we used to feel about one another. Xing, you must be beaming with pride hearing Amy telling you that you were charming -grins- but you're a great guy, keep it up.   I've been occupying myself with comics, and 'Naruto' a series i've been interested since quite some time ago is a wonderful manga. I've even learnt quite a few things about life as well.   "when you want to protect someone so important to you, you'll become so much stronger, don't you have someone important in your life as well?"     I'm looking forward to   'Phat nite'   -winks-  I want to protect  you  even if its the pain I have to bear with.     Translate the mysteries of our dreams, let me bleed the words.
