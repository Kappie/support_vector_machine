Since 1934,  Donald  has played a mischevious counterpart to the snug  Mickey Mouse  with his infamous smoker's quack, leaving a mark on both the  Disney  channel and pop culture that will last for a long time. "Donald particularly appreciates this," said  Disney  chief executive  Michael Eisner , who helped present the star in front of the  El-Capitan Theatre  in Hollywood.  One of the first cartoon characters to receive worldwide appreciation,  Donald  and girlfriend  Daisy Duck  have inspired numerous spin-offs, from the  Huey, Dewey,  Louie  nephew trio to the short-lived superhero  Darkwing Duck . Though constantly unintelligible in his raspy delivery,  Donald  easily won over America, the final proof-of-celebrity being this legendary  Walk of Fame  award. As for a post-promenade celebration,  Donald  commented that "even though it isn't Winter,  Daisy  will be migrating south tonight."  000000000000000000000
