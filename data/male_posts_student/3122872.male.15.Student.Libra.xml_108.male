Pictures will be up...     eventually     Since I won't be home till the 21st of August...    Only... 26 days left...    :/    On to other news...    My assessment of Uncle's driving has been changed,    He's  suicidal ...    He went and tried to take on a 16 wheeler lorry...    No, seriously...    Its a 3 lane motorway, we're in thelane at the very left, the lorry was  at the one on the right...    And we both wanted to change to the centre...    At one point I could see the ring on the lorry driver's extended middle finger...    :/    And yes, all of this at about 80 miles an hour...    The other thing I learned today was   never   trust a female with navigation...    Yes, I'm well aware of how stereotypical/sexist/chauvinistic that comment seems and I apologise, but hear me out first...    To get back to Torontofrom Niagara Falls we had to get back on themotorway, we had no idea how and decided to look at the map, that yieldedno clues either, so we drove along until we saw a sign that pointed us in the right direction, so we followed it along, and sure enough there was a junction to turn right aheadto lead us up onto the motorway.    While the driving was going onAunt was looking quizzically at the map, and as the turn came she suddenly told us we were going to the wrong way, and she'd explain, but we definitely shouldn't turn right... So we listened to her (as she was rather hysterical at this stage and was complaining about how we didn't listen) and turned left, doing a rather large circuit of the neighbourhood.    We were completely confused by her explanation and decided to ask a police officer...   "Get back to Toronto? Sure, just follow that road until you get to the junction, thenturn right, it'll lead you straightonto theExpressway"   If anyone wants to prove me wrong on this point, feel free...    Meh...
