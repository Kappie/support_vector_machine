A cousin of a friend stopped by who was short, fat, and arrogant. He was trying to convince me that meat eating was normal. It was frustrating. Especially since he was fat and I didn't really want to say it to his face. I attempted to show some self-restraint.  Besides that, I've been to another good friend's house like all this week. I think today marks the fifth consecutive day I have technically been at his house. It's good fun, playing Halo and staying up until your eyes won't do anything but shut. It's had pretty horrible effects on my body, I'm eating a lot of junk and weird times and haven't had a really good night's rest in forever. That's especially weird considering it's summer.  I also ventured to the mall yesterday. I picked up the most awesome pair of  urlLink jeans  that mankind has ever beheld. Another kick-ass belt and some dark-colored undershirts. It feels amazing to look good. Unfortunately, my parents think I've gone anorexic over the past few weeks, which isn't true, but I've gone on a fairly restrictive home-brewed diet as well as exercise.  I also went bowling at another party at the very end of June, which was quite exciting as well. Nothing too eventful. I'm now pondering whether to drop my web site subscription. I'm burning "debt" fairly quickly. I've already dropped by $12.95/month Asheron's Call subscription. Now it's probably the same with my web site one. I want a lot of things and these subscriptions are really hurting me monetarily. I get a lot more enjoyment staring at myself in my tight American Eagle jeans that costed $48 than attempting to code some stupid computer language on the internet. Of course, I couldn't have fit into those jeans a month or two ago. I'm also pretty vain, but it's really quite fun. I'll try to post later.
