Anyway, the hair on his back had gotten really matted and it couldn't be combed out. So my mom desided to take him to the vet and have the hair on his  back  shaved off. Well, when my mom picked him up from the vet later in the day he was COMPLETELY SHAVED except for his head, feet, and the last three inches of his tail, they call it a lion cut....  So somehow things got mixed up and no one told the girl who was shaving my cat not to shave his whole body, just his back. Now my cat looks like one of those small dogs mixed with a cow colored pig. Poor guy.    I wish I had a camera to show you how bad he looks.
