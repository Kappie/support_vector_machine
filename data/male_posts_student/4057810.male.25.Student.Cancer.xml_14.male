I'm really surprised to see that in the span of a few short days, I've almost hit 100.  I'd say that about 15 or so of those hits are from me, though :P  I wonder how many people are arriving here by accident, or whether many people are bothering to stay a while?  I've also added links to the left hand column.  I wish I could say that there's something for everyone, but I chose only the sites that interest me the most of the links I visit on a daily, or almost, basis.  So maybe there isn't something for everyone, but I can provide some assurance of quality if you're interested in video games, comics, movies, martial arts, or Japan.  Unfortunately, there are space limitations, and I don't know how to make the text align on both the left and right side.  Text that isn't aligned on both sides bothers me; I don't like the jagged words on the right.  If you come across any links you thing I'd be interested in, please post it in the comments!
