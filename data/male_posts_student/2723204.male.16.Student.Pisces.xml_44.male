A godly society is not exactly a christian one.  Our aim as christians is not to convert our society, to evangelize to it, and to make it more "christian". In fact, I am against christian governance, or any religious one for the matter. You give me a vote, I'll vote for any party which is secular. Maybe i'll just address christianity specifically. I would never want to be under a christian government, unless it is progressive, pluralistic and inclusive. Politics should remain secular, and no whiff of christianity should be in any government policy.  I am by no means a radical christian. I do not consider myself a radical christian. This is why I do not approve of street witnessing. Our aim as christians is to transform society into a godly one, not a christian one. A godly one is where moral values are upheld, where pluralism remains, where Christianity has the same status as any other religion and is viewed as their equal. What about the Abu Gharib Totures?   Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Christian or not. It corrupts you. That's bush. In fact, I'm a supporter of the Iraq war, Saddam should be ousted. But only one problem, Bush is in charge. You can be a christian but say that the totures are wrong, but as long as you view christianity as superior. And then suddenly you're in control of thousands of nuclear ICBMs and the world's most powerful army under your hands, coupled with the belief that "God has placed you here at this place at this time for a purpose". Try seeing whether you'll blow up this planet or not because of your bigotry.  The president's faith, wrote Klein, "does not give him pause or force him to reflect. It is a source of comfort and strength but not of wisdom."  Try mixing religion and politics, it makes you dumb. nuff said.
