I don't remember a lot of it, but I do remember that as we went down Forest Avenue JT, who, oddly, was not in the bus, was walking alongside the bus, also impossible as he was not running and the bus was going its normal speed.  Furthermore, he was defying physics by every once and a while stepping onto the bus and then stepping back onto the sidewalk. Bizarre.  I don't remember the events after this until I find myself at an odd shop located on a road near McKnight Road, near Sam's Club. It's that little shortcut road in the vicinity of St. Sebastian's and Starbucks and the postal depot. Anyway, it was somehow located along there and the bus stopped.  I'm not sure how I got into this, but the people in the store, who seemed to know our bus driver were bribing me to give names of people I knew. I remember giving the name of a person in my band, and they remarked that they could "get" him "at PNC Park."  I never understand my dreams. They seem to have no significance whatsoever except for to annoy me and cause me to wake up with a headache.   He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it.  (Douglas Adams)
