My neighbour had a party there and we were invited to stay over the weekend. Over 800 liter of beer, 96 bottles of 'Kirsch-Korn', a party tent and a fresh 70 kg pig for grilling were organized. 200 people and more were expected and we were supposed to sleep in tents.  If you think that this sounds like a lot of fun ... then you are right. The weather was perfect. A clear blue sky, the sun was burning on our skin and the people were very relaxed :))  But all this is of no relevance for me!  If you think of it at least, destiny hits you. I was thrilled immediatley by the look of her beautiful, soft eyes. To my surprise, these eyes looked back on me. Over and over again. Everything around us faded away. I wanted to say something, but I was not able to. When I heard her calm and warm voice, it felt like I was struck down by lightning. Time seemed to be non-existent any more. Everything happened so fast, no talking was needed. We searched for a calm place and I had the greatest time of my life.  Almut, I love you! And I can't wait to see you again soon :)
