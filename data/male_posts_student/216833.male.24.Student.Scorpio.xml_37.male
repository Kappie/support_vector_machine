I turned in a request in December to get my disposal replaced and the lights in my kitchen and garage replaced. Mark is the 'make ready' guy but sometimes the service manager, Tom, gives him a few tickets to handle.   Tom said he does maybe 10% of all the repair work around the complex.  By the way, both Mark and Tom are very nice guys.  Mark is always smiling and laughing but he sorta weirds me out, i dunno, he just does.  Tom, well, he is just a rock n roll guy who loves guitars.  He is always wanted to 'jam' out with me at every chance he can get; I have yet to take the time and 'jam' with Tom. Well, anyways, Wednesday I was determined to talk to the folks at the office about this lack of follow through with my disposal, lights, and now my carpet pad that was removed when my water heater broke a few weeks ago.  I really didn't want to get any of the guys in trouble becuase I wasn't sure who did the work; correction, who DIDN"T do the work.  I had been on the look out for Tom all day, he is always riding around in his golf cart so I was sure eventually I would see him.  I didn't see him in the morning or at lunch when I came home, but after work I just decided to go to the office, I hate dealing with those prissy girls, but oh well.  Just so happens, I'm backing out of my spot and ZOOM! here comes Tom on his cart; so I wave him down.  We talked for a while, about all that was wrong with my  pad.  He apologized and I said he no big deal really.  I wasn't that pissed, not anymore.  He told me I was paying for the service plenty and needed to take atvantage of it.  Your right Tom.  I need to step up.  Anyway, Tom is coming over on Friday before noon.  I'm off, so maybe we can 'jam.'
