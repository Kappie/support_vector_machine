I missed out the maths on mon and tues, my brain still gets pretty tired easily, cant really say i am back at full strength.Got to watch my health. cant let it deteriorate again. The feeling of lying in bed again makes me shiver. Well spent the day watching anime gundam seed and playing some wc3 and cs. Its been a while since i played wc3, still as fun as ever.Yup games are fun but playing for too long can be bad for your health so i gotta restrain myself, i dun wanna collaspe and die. It has happened to other unfortunate pple before.   Still got a lot of things in my mind. I gotta learn to relax and let go off these annoying tensions within me.Its not worth getting so stressed out over trivial things
