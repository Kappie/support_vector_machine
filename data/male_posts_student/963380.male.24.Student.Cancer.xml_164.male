Blurry with my glasses on, blurry with them off. I have some fun driving home - I imagine this is probably what drunk driving looks like minus the slow reaction time. Driving home wasn't so bad, but as soon as I got downstairs to the basement it became very clear that this is going to get worse all day. I can see find in pitch black - I'm closing my eyes while I type this because the brightness of my LCD display is a little too bright for once. I brought my iPod with me to the Opticians as I was told that I would be waiting 15 to 30 minutes in order to make sure my eyes dialted completely. THe first set of drops were the yellow dye/anesthetic that I had last time. The second set were designed to dialate my eyes; they stung.   I've taken a few pictures of my eyes and captured some video - very cool look - they're almost completely black. Needless to say, I'm very excited about this procedure.  I've got an orthadontist appointment tomorrow at noon - apparently I missed one earlier this week. That kinda sucks - hopefully he'll be able to tell me when I get my braces off.  I bought Star Trek: Voyager Season Two - it's turning out to be a more interesting show when you can see all the episodes in their original broadcast order. The one thing that bothers me is that in almost every single episode they're getting their asses kicked. It's Archer Syndrome all over again.
