That appears to work  like a charm.  Jskuros: where do you recommend i try to get people to download it and  do you have anyones ip address and port that already have the server  that i can tamper with?  Lineman: I would try 127.0.0.1. I'd bet almost anything that they are  infected with the trojan. Probably some pathetic script kiddie.  Jskuros: sorry how would i do that - thanks for helping me  Lineman: If they hav a trojan, they probably left their system wide  open. Try logging in through your internet browser. Just enter this in  IE or wherever: \127.0.0.1\c$ If they left their system unsecured, you  will be able to access their hard drive with this.  Jskuros: That lamer is running windows!
