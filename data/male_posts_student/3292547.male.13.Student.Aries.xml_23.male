Spyware is a relatively new kind of threat that common anti-virus applications do not yet cover. If you see new toolbars in your Internet Explorer that you didn't intentionally install, if your browser crashes, or if you browser start page has changed without your knowing, you most probably have spyware. But even if you don't see anything, you may be infected, because more and more spyware is emerging that is silently tracking your surfing behaviour to create a marketing profile of you that will be sold to advertisement companies. Spybot-S is free, so there's no harm in trying to see if something snooped into your computer, too.  That's right, the long awaited 1.3 RC5 has come out. Spybot hasn't updated their systems in about 1 1/2 months (The actually program even longer). Long enough for me to lose hope. Thankfully, though release several  days/weeks ago, I ran across this. You can check out the website at  urlLink www.spybot.info . I leave you with a quote from the site:  Those of you who have downloaded Spybot-S in the past days will already have seen it - we've now got a public 1.3 version.  In addition to a larger database, speedier scan and many fixed bugs, an important part is named TeaTimer (explanation of that name will follow in the FAQ), which is the new on-access protection part of Spybot-S  A full list of changes will be posted here later on, but is also available in our support forum now.  Thanks to everyone who helped making this new release possible!    Edit- 5:16PM You can download 1.3 RC5  urlLink here .The site doesn't show the RC5.
