Well, maybe for you it won't be a critical status to be "psychedelic", but when you're in there knowing nothing about what's going to happen next, then "kabloosh..." =P   But the reason i smoke? I really don't know. But now all i know is that i have this one "judgement stick" left in my W-Lights' case. If i take that one, i won't smoke again... darn.
