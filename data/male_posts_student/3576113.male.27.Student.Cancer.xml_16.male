All this Gareth overlooks, attention drawn instead to rafters of hanging banners and a coat of arms collection never amassed in one court before.  Up to the shock and pain in faces of servants stopped to take a peek seemingly unnoticed.  His glance travels over to the ancient table made of some unbeknownst dark hued wood.  All present around the great symbol of brotherhood are solemn in face, all but one that is.  Sir Modred wounded in Lancelots’ escape sits smugly, as if all transpiring falls according to some grand scheme. Sir Gawain now at the Kings right Kay as always to the left.  Something said, falls on deaf ears as he mentally counts the others.  So few remain, days before a dozen were slain by Lancelot and the other absentees his family and kin fled for fear of reprisal. “Sir Gareth?” addresses Arthur once more. “Gareth, snap to man!  The king speaks to you!” reprimands Gawain.  Revelry ended, Gareth turns to the fellowship.  “Your Lordship, you command me?” The King pointing at the disheveled queen orders “Escort her to her apartments.  You and Gaheris shall hold vigil on her this evening to be her last.  Grant her any earthly wishes.  I shall send a troupe for you at Dawn and I’ll see you at the execution grounds.”  “Yes Milord.” Gareth humbly replies and is echoed “Of course, Milord.” By his Brother Gaheris  Traversing the grandiose halls of Camelot Gareth once more gets caught up in reflection.  In how the shadows would seem to dance in union with the sconces that spawned them in an endless game of tug and how the cobblestones would click as he walked with almost a skipped pace, reduced now only to gloom and echo.  Walls all adorned with tapestries of valiant kings victorious in battle, but none of shepherds.  Even the noise of the constant hawking in the township below had fallen silent on this day.  “Did you ever notice that at times you can almost hear change or smell it in the air?  That the land seems to breathe it and if you could only see it, then it could be halted or harnessed.” rhetoricized Gareth as the three ascend the stairs leading to Gwenevere’s chambers.  “Perhaps it is this, the sorcerers tap, in creating their prophecy.” surmises Gaheris.  “I didn’t know you were so profound, Gareth.  A philosopher knight, how amusing.” smarts Gwen.  “Besides, I don’t hear anything.” states the Queen matter of factly.  “I know,” Gareth sighs resigned to keep his brooding to himself and a silence overcomes the trio.  Turning down the corridor leading to their destination Gaheris chimes in “There is an easy, peaceful painless way we could end this Milady.  Sending for poison, in your sleep you could merely fade away.  God wouldn’t slight her that, right Gareth?”  “He will, come for me.” Gwen confidently states now skipping over every other step.  “This is what we fear.” offers Gareth.  “Have you know shame, woman?” interjects Gaheris. “How much travesty shall you invoke in your reign?”   “How many women have you lain with?  How many has Arthur?  In this, I am no more guilty.” lectures Gwen.  “What of you, Beaumains?” “Call him that not, adulteress.” stammers Gaheris.  Pausing for moment Gareth answers “Beaumains, I am, mayhap not of the kitchen but servant none the less, unto God first, and to Arthur yes, but not his crown, to that vision and to the table.  Truly Lancelot is a peerless knight and his prowess coupled with your transgressions shall sunder all Arthur has built.” pleads Gareth.  “One son of Orkney has already fallen by his hands.” adds Gaheris.  “My father loved Arthur, you all love him.  Truly he is great.  I never had him whole, in this I am not strong and share in vision.” explains Gwen.  “I do and in it I believe!” Gareth exclaims.  “Damn you Gareth, damn you Gaheris, and damn your land.” shouts Gwen now red in the face.  With that they arrive at the large oak door leading to the Queens room.  Flushed in mind and body Gareth proffers, “Will you eat Milady?”  “For now, I wish only to write” responds Gwen curtly.  “Well here we shall remain, and need you anything, be sure to beckon”   “Thank you, Gareth” Gwen says sincerely.  The Door closes leaving the brothers to settle into their Guardianship.  Selecting an alcove with a window overlooking a large swathe of town and of the barbican, Gareth first stretches then rests against the brick wall captivated by a scene taking place below.  “Have you ever asked yourself what makes a man noble, brother?” queried Gareth as he watched a dirt-covered man pile wood in the street below the arch in which he now reclined.  “God did, of course.  He set us above the others” offers Gaheris as he spits out the window.  “In that choice shouldn’t we feel somehow indebted?” reasons Gareth.  “What’s gotten into you this evening?  I’m going to fetch us some drink, that should right your senses and tonight we shall toast Aggravayne”  The hours wane. Gareth dazes as Gaheris sips from his flask, telling a mounted boar head of all the deeds of his twin brother Aggravayne.  In this tired state Gareth comes to think again of the circular table, except now it was very large.  Gareth felt like an ant beside it.  The table had come to dwarf even mountains.  It now spanned rivers, toppled castle fortresses and encompassed the clouds.  Yet it showed its’ age, crumbling at the touch.  Whatever once held it together was no longer present, long forgotten or stolen away.  A quake rocks it, the black timbers split.  Gareth cries out, “No!” and moves to save it.  Too heavy for him to hold, its pieces crash together.  “It’s gone now” emanates an unrecognizable voice.  “No!” Gareth sobs into his own hands.  “Torn down by prideful knights” offers the voice.  Gareth scans the landscape for assistance, or comfort in company at least, and spots his brother Gaheris.  “You remember the tree fort we built, Gareth?” ponders Gaheris stirring Gareth from his trance.  “What?” intones Gareth, impatience showing on his tear strewn cheeks.  “The tree house Aggravayne, Gawain, and I built in the woods back home.” reminded Gaheris.  “We would play at king for days on end, and in later years you and Modred would come to join us.  You remember it right?” hoped Gaheris.  “Ahh, yes.” recollects Gareth.  “Aggravayne made a good king,” assured Gaheris “Was just poor at homage.  Anyways it’s gone now…”  “Sorry?” interrupted Gareth.  “The fort, it’s gone now.  Forest was burned to the ground, father would not share it.” filled in Gaheris.  “Yes right, I did hear of that” states Gareth.  “Ever the hothead was our father” justifies Gareth.  Now fully awake he begins to shine his armaments.  “We must look our best, on this morning of justice.”   Finished polishing and sharpening his sword Gareth sheaths it and then removes his belt.  “What are you doing, brother?” questions Gaheris confusion evident upon his face.  “Dawn draws nigh, we should be ready.”  “Remove yours as well.” Gareth calmly retorts.  “Today we go unarmed.” resolved Gareth turns to the arch in which he resided the night through while Gaheris can only stare dumbfounded.  Outside townsfolk, already busy in preparation for what should be an interesting and hectic day, and first there were things that could not be left undone.  A boy herding a small group of Bovine towards the gates and to the fields beyond looks up.  Two stories up a nobleman watches him, a knight perhaps even.  There is much distress in this knight’s face and eyes, he addresses the boy.  The boy replies with a meek “Yes sir?”  “Heard you of the Black Knight, Sir Perarde and his brothers?” tests the man from above.  “Indeed, is a tale common enough.” acquiesced the boy.  The knight in the window then drops what looks to be a sheathed sword and belt.  “With that sword, I able to overcame them all.  Perhaps it might serve you as it did me”  “Sir Gareth?” Bewildered the boy watches as Gareth turns back in towards the hall.  Grasping up his sudden bestowed gift the boy returns to his charges the cows.  Prodding them out the city and to the hill and field beside the wood, he thought only of the great knights.  With his very own instrument of death, he was Tristram, Lancelot, and Lamerok.  Maidens swooned at his passing, bard sang of his chivalric deeds, and he dined in amidst lords.  Responsibility brings the boy back to earth, and noticing the cows had split and begun to wander.    While corralling them back into a cohesive group he espies a procession emerging from the castle.  Somewhere within was the queen on her way to meet her fate of treason.  All cattle rounded but one, this he spots moving towards the trees and makes way to head her off.  About to reprimand the adventuresome cow, he spots a glint of metal in amidst the shadows of the copse.  He can make out the forms of many men on horse.  Just then a cry emits from within and the charge is on.  The horsemen quickly overtake the kingsmen and after a brief but bloody scuffle, they spirit the queen away.  Queen rescued again by Lancelot and his ilk, for it could only be him that could issue death so skillfully.  Distraught the boy returns to his animal companions.  Lost somewhere in the grass on that hill, Gareth’s’ sword now lies discarded.  Twenty Knights were to die that day, Gareth and Gaheris among them.  Both were said to be unarmed and were yet assailed and in that skirmish the last stroke was struck to a kingdom.
