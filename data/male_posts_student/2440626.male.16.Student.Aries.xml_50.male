I mean, you'll have that....anyway.  Be in school on Tuesday, in Mrs. O's room, 8th period. CUPCAKES.  Figure out your soap opera name.  It is your middle name plus your street name.  For example: I am "David Derrick".  Go ahead ....it is fun... You can also figure out your..ehmm.."adult entertainer" name.  Just take the name of the first pet you ever had plus your mom's maiden name.  If anyone has a good one, let me know! I'm out.......
