I'll tell you those things now, in the hopes that you wil ponder them as well, and maybe our collective pondering will force the universe into revealing some sort of an answer to me.  Here are my problems:  1. I can't decide if I should have the closing ellipsis (the four dots) at the end of the title of this blog ("And it seems like... rain....") or just have nothing ("And it seems like... rain").  I want it to seem, you know, mysterious and whatnot, but I can't decide which form of puncuation, or non-punctuation, I guess, would be best to convey this deep emotion to my readers.  2. I'm hiding behind a crude and rusty veil of lies.  Why?  Because my name is not "Matt."  I am called, in reality, Matthew.  I'm sorry that I have mislead you, dear reader, up to this point, but I have reasons for this action, and I would like to present them for your review.  You see, in this world of baggy pants and backward-facing hats, the highest goal for many is to appear "cool" and "desirable," and sometimes even "sane."  In an attempt to do this, I gathered up from my real name what were unnecessary letters in my opinion, and I tossed them aside in the hopes of updating my appearance and seeming more cool.  I am a teenager, and that's what this world has told me to do.  However, am I listening to my heart?  My heart tells me, "Matthew, why do you deny your true name?  You have never been a 'Matt,' and you never will be.  You know good and well that your parents had seven distinct letters in mind when they told the birth-certificate-writer what to put on your birth certificate."  I respond to that remark by eating five bags of potato chips in order to make my heart suffer for what it has said to me.  And yet I still do not know what to do.  Is the blood-sucking mass of tissue inside my chest cavity correct, or should I listen to what the pot-smokers and jump-rope-jumpers at my school tell me?  I'm sad now.  I don't know how I am going to get into my pajamas and go to bed tonight.  My problems weigh me down.  I smell fish.  --   Update:   I took the plunge and listened to my heart.  I basically had to, because the sneaky little critter threatened to give me a nosebleed, and I don't have any tissues handy.  So from now on, until I change my mind again, I will be known as Matthew on this blog, and on Neptune.  Thanks for the consideration.
