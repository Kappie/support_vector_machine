Divided Sky Opener, the first real Golgi in who knows how long. Just puts a tear to my eye, THAT part in Down with Disease, the Divided Sky solo that always takes me up to the ceiling of wherever i am, and of course, a Fishman vacuum solo that begs the question will we ever hear another one? and to a syd barrett song? come on, this setlist is almost unbeatable. reaffirms my love, my respect and my languor for this band.  Great night tonight, peter, stuart, daniel, gary, nick, cason, alec, and i, really fun, bummed that i couldn't spend more time, but am headed to the Sphinx tomorrow with my bro, 9,342 feet of sweetness and a view worthy of Zeus
