After the commercial I was shocked – no, not because they’re potentially addingdangerous chemicalto the Kool-Aid to increase the evaporation rate in order to make it “feel cooler,” but rather because of the “Kool-Aid Man” himself who distracted me so much I didn’t even notice what the commercial was about until a second viewing.   I’m going to do a bit of background here. You all remember the “Kool-Aid Man” right? Big sentient clear pitcher of red Kool-Aid, black line for a mouth and dots for eyes, propensity for busting through walls and saying, “Oh Yeah!” likethe slightly retarded cousinof“Macho Man” Randy Savage. Now, think really hard, just how well do you remember him?   Well, if you’re cursed to remember every single commercial in your life as I am, you’ll quickly notice the “Kool-Aid Man” now has pants on. Shorts, actually. Khaki shorts to be exact. My roommate and I turned to each other after seeing this with the exact same “what the hell?” look on our faces. I was the first to say something after an awkward silence.   “What the shit, the “Kool-Aid Man” doesn’t have a wang, he doesn’t need pants!” Similar dialogue was retorted by my roommate, and we laughed about it all night (did I mention we were quite drunk?) while watching equally asinine shows and playing video games.   Today, over breakfast, we returned to the topic by proposing the “Kool-Aid Man” busting through a wall with a two-foot-long brilliant redphallus in his hand rather than a refreshing pitcher of Kool-Aid. We basically agreed that the “Kool-Aid Man” is really a “man” in name only (usually called “guy” by younger children.) My roommate never saw the “Kool-Aid Man” as a potential child molester until now, and I don’t think anyone in their right mind wondered why a colossal pitcher of vibrant red fruit-flavored drink didn’t have a penis.     His sexual ambiguity and innocence has been ruined by the Kool-Aid people with this move. Whether it’s an attempt to freshen up the image, appeal to the “x-treme” crowd, or due to pressure put on by concerned parents is unknown. What IS known is that a childhood icon – a CULTURAL icon – has been defaced. Please, Kool-Aid, bring back the stark-naked hero that is the original “Kool-Aid Man”!
