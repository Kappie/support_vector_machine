And yes, to my shame, I lost. I gots a big yellow blister on there now, hahahaha! Anyway, I must of been pretty drunk because I woke up in the airport on my own. How the fuck did I get there? I woke up in a chair but I really can't remember getting there. I remember everything upto arriving at the bus stop. And then there's a few hours of nothing in my mind. And then I woke up at the airport. Maybe I took the wrong bus or something. I need some fucking answers.
