It is a "summer workshop" for those who are on there school's yearbook staff. This will be my first year attending this camp, and I really dont know what is about to happen. David, you know him as bagel05, is going all out with his blog. Well if I can figure out how to, I will try to catch "pressious moments" with my video camera and try and put them in my new blog. Dont get your hopes up, because im not sure on how to do it, But if I get something worth it, I guarentee I will try my best to put it on here. Well thats all about "Camp Orlando" for now. I leave at 9 am sharp to go on this wonderful trip. I will be back later with full of posts in my blog. Being that I do need to catch up with my fellow River peeps. So till then, Avri A durchi
