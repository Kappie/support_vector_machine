When i was down at my fathers for the weekend i cleaned out the guest room closet and found a stash of 100% wool tiny tiny yarn from my grandmother, i think that went into a baby blanket or layette that i wore in the hospital 23 years ago. Well. There were tons of skeins left, and it was in good condition so i brought it home.  When i finished my homespun socks i cast on a sock in this yarn, on tiny needles. It works up very nicely and works with tante fanny's sock pattern, so i can knit at the tv or on the bus or in class, as i have that pattern engraved on my nervous system. So, it took one skein to knit up one sock and i must have twenty or so left, so i think everyone will get the socks they were asking for for christmass.  I am thinking that i will try dyeing some of it because creamy white wool for like 10 pairs of socks would drive me mad. I think i might also try knitting up a scarf in a lace pattern. I have to write a paper tonight, haven't finished the book yet, but it's due tomorrow, so i have to work it like i have to make rent, i guess. Nothing wild and exciting, school, knitting, weight loss. That's about it. Please, someone tell me that people are still doing wildly exciting things out there. Please.
