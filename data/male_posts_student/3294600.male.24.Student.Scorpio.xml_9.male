After class her and I planned for a few minutes.  Classes went well, but I'm stressed about keeping up with JavaScript and getting my assignments done for English.    After classes I went to Joe and David's and hung out at their place until Joe got home.  After he relaxed a while he cut my hair; I think it looks good.  About that time we made dinner arrangements.  Joe and I had dinner with David, Becky and Donna, Becky and David's mom, and Donna's Dad.  We went to the Bothell Main St Ale House.  We all had steak and it was really good.  On the TV's there was San Jose Sharks and the Calgary Flames.  Calgary beat San Jose to win the series.  It was a crazy finish with an open net goal in the last second of the game.  We also watched the Mariners get screwed by a bad call which could have cost them a win.  Back to Joe and David's house I went with Joe.  David took his own car.  Joe and I made a quick stop at Fred Meyer's for dessert.  We watched a Christian series called Penguins or something like that.  It was kinda funny and a good moral for younger kids.  This episode was about lying.  It was weird how the main characters were named Jason (me), Michelle (cousin, but in the show his sister), Grandma (as herself), and Karl (my Dad, but forget the character for the name).  I found that interesting and ironic.  Joe had gotten this movie from a coworker.  I left Lake City at midnight.  I arrived home, checked the mail, and what happened next is STILL a mystery.  I pulled my keys out of my pocket enough to unlock the house door.  At that point, my car keys went somewhere.  I have looked inside and outside and anywhere they could possibly be (except where they actually are).  If the are inside the house, I'm okay.  If they are outside, I'm a little uncomfortable with that.  I have torn everything apart looking for them.  I will try again tomorrow morning to see if I can find them before leaving for classes.  Thankfully I have a spare car key.  All my other important keys, minus my PO Box and another house key (for someone else's place).  Dale even helped look outside and in and not a sign of where they went.  It's more than unbelievable.  They have disappeared and it's driving me crazy.  Anyway, I can't do anything else about it tonight.  I'm going to go to bed and hope to find them in the morning (only a few hours away *sigh*).  If you see my keys, please let me know instead of stealing my car. ;)  Thanks!  Oh yeah, before I forget...Apparently Jackie's sister's friend Cory hasn't been able to access the Internet is why I haven't heard from him.  *shrug*  Who knows, still not holding my breath, but hopeful again.
