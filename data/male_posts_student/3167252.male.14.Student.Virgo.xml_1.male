Left the house at 7.20 which is like, uber late and true enough, I only made it halfway across the parade ground before I was grounded. Good thing Mrs. Ng didn't drag me to TAF club though. Yea, woke upwith 5minutesto 7 and slept at 2am last night.  So blame me.  Aniwaez, listening to Revolution from the album Revolution by MIKE. Hahaz, bet you thought I was gonna say Revolution didn't ya? Lolz so aniwaex, it's kinda pumped up music with lots of screaming and stuff so i'm pumped up myself too, lolz. Bleahz, Yu Yu actually started getting heated up with me last night, lolz, like talking in one of those tones before you turn hysterical, yea.. Hahaz, she's pretty stressed, poor thing.. Wish I could help her the way she helped me. Yeapz. Today was wacked and whacked from end-to-end or rather, morning-to-evening since my dayu ended at about 6. Yea, slept half the time during school so nvm. Ken tried to.. well nvm but I jus felt kinda pissed so I was like "stfu!" hahaz, pronounced as stu-fu.Lessons weren't great but I lived. They seemed surprisingly shorter than usual!  Hmmm, what sucked is that I did the wrong comprehension, hiaz.. that's what you get for doing your homework at 11pm. Actually, I got around to it at 1am but wth. Lolz, Dickson got the same thing too. So aniwaez, I had my CGH appointment so I got to skip the English Common Test and go straight home. However, because of the installation of the sinks and stuff, the water was cut off( Ihate it when that happens) so I gathered some clothes and headed to CGH. Damned, couldn't even make some instant noodles! Hahaz, acted kinda cool I guess, felt totally rebellious against my school uniform with my shoes and Cd player. Oh and that red bag too!The therapy was wierd, like the therapist hated me or something, lolz. 'Cos she just kept assigning me exercisesas if she wanted to keep me busy so that she could attend to other patients. Haha but I guess it's okay, sinceI haven't reached the critical stage yet. Some wierd exercises included a funny machine with pedals that u moved with your hand,lying on a ball while lifting 1kg weights, doing exercises with a kind ofrubber thing that's like a ballon, doing that same thing with weights and a pulley and lastly, doing some sorta exercises on this machine that's a cross between a pull up bar and one of those barsthat have two horizontal poles side-by-side. Yea, wierd!! But what's wierder is that I decided to give Vernon the CD when I got back? Alotofmiscommunication between his maid, grandma, him and me. Lolz, it was kinda irritating but funny all the same.Damned,Vernon made me this uber-chio girl who looked so O.o lala~. Haiz, speakin of which I accidentally swore using the F word when I was attempting to teach Ian that your head can actually be *******. Bleahz, why must I ALWAYS be right? Haha, dammit though, couldn't stop thinking dirtythoughts.. Must stop it sialz!   Okay okay, what's wierd later isthat I actuallyMET CHARIS!?! Yea, I decided to give myself a treat to mashed potato at 7-11 and I actually met her and her mum? The cashier seems to know her pretty well and was talking to her about devloping this film that she was gonna put inside one of those photo boxes where they'll deliver the photos to your house. Her mum didn't seem to see me though, despite everything happening nearby. So, yea.. said hi and stuff, sad though.. we're no longer growing apart. We ARE apart. So, yea.. maybe it's God or something? Maybe he's trying to get me back in but I dunno, don't think I know her anymore. Oh and that Pepsi bottle in my yellow bicycle basket is finally gone, lolz. Although I have this nagging feeling that my Dad threw it away.   As a final note, my crystal growing is not doing too well, Mr. Lo doesn't want to add chromium but I guess that I gotta abide. Too lazy... or should I? Hahaz, nothing! Yea, aniwaez, it's reacting with the solution to form this milk-white thread like substance that's floating around. Kinda yucky! The crystal is growing layer over layer so we have crystals within crystals. But one end is horribly shaped. Yucks to look at! Doubt we can win this year..
