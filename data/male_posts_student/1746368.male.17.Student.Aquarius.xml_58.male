My stomach hurts because I really want to see her, but it's not going to happen. Well, let me wrap up my day in a few paragraphs.  TA: I had to help check computers in the library. It was pretty simple work, but very repetitive.   Web-Design: Well, as you know from the below posted, I had a project due today. It was so easy it took me less time sourcing it by hand than most of the people who used editors. So I got done early, than I played some Jezzball, got bored of that, made a new log-in name and started playing Chip's Challenge. I never found the point in that game. It's very interesting though. One of those new-fangled puzzle games.  Lunch: If I was graded in this subject, I would fail horribly.  US History: We did NOTHING! Seriously, she told us to finish up our timelines, and the rest of the day was free time. What the heck is up with that? I was so bored, I just read for the entire period, but really didn't read at the same time. One of those days.  After School: I had to skateboard home today, cause my mom had school until sometime past three. I was tired by the time I got home. I suppose I don't live to far if I skate home. It took me about 30 minutes to get home. It's just annoying; and tiring.   Let's see, what else can I rant and rave about? I am kind of bored so I might surf the net aimlessly. I fell asleep when I got home, but I was woken by two phone calls and a knock at the door. Grr, stupid after school responsibilties. I think having to do anything after school should be made illegal. Last Thursday night at school I got tired of listening to him talk, so I started writing a story. I will eventually start writing the story using Blogger. That would definitely take the bored out of boredom, and then it would only leave the "om". That's a difficult word to spell..."definitely". I had to look it up on  urlLink Dictionary.com  to get it right. My fingers automatically spell it defeinetly. Definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely. Oh well, I will probably spell it wrong in the future, it's just one of those words. Like Geometry. Well, I would like to thank all 5 of my loyal readers for reading this. I hope that eventually it will become 6.
