Johnson   You are my friend Never leaving my side Your arms are wide open I've got nowhere to hide This love amazes me  Not backing out Not backing down I'm giving this heart to you    Chorus:  My Savior, Redeemer Most intimate friend Through it all you've been with me You're my beginning and end I have nothing to fear, Lord As you hold onto my hand Oh Jesus you are, My most intimate friend   You are my King Always knowing what's true I'm sorry for lying To myself and to you This grace is over me  Not backing out Not backing down I'm giving this mind to you   Chorus   You are my truth Always shining your light Exposing my darkness You reveal a new life This power lives in me  Not backing out  Not backing down I'm giving my all for you (repeat?)   Chorus    Br. 1   Your love amazes me Your grace is over me Your power lives in me   Chorus    Br. 2  I'm giving my heart to you I'm giving my mind to you I'm giving my all for you   Chorus
