Of course I was asked to go, however I do not know the person and I have always felt that people's lives have been trivialized by the way I have seen Desi and Muslims treat the affair. After the service, the next questions/ conversations are: lets go to the mall, nice shoes, blah blah blah. There is no reflection on the person's life or the significance of death.   I would like to think the concept of death would leave a profound impact on people, but it is something that people make a joke out of and willingly accept. I think someone's death is a place to reflect on the person's character and to discuss who they were and to discuss broader issues of life and death, and to think about our own place in that continuum, but I have never heard people bring up such topics, so I try to avoid funerals and services like the plague. I will think about the person who died when I am walking today, when I am eating, and sitting down--about what this loss means in the personal spheres and the grand scheme of things. I will try to take one more step in understanding humanities' journey that leads to death and begins a new after death.  I think that is why I took mom’s death so differently. I was naïve and thought that the world would stop, but it went on with its business. I thought people would look at her death and understand what it meant—I have always looked at her death through a political lens. I do not think it was cancer per se that killed her, but the environment that she was in for so many years: she worked midnight shifts, we lived near a factory in Livonia, and the stresses of everyday life in this country. Later on in my life I found out that women who work midnight shifts have a higher rate of cancer and I found out the factory we lived near released massive amounts of toxic chemicals into the air. Mom’s death was one more reason to be involved every waking moment to make this world better so other women would not have to go through what I went through and so other son’s would not lose their mother. I will never forget the last words she whispered in my ear as tears rolled down my cheeks: ayhh mara bacha.   I miss Mom everyday. I hope she has found peace and is happy with what I am doing. I cannot wait to see her again.
