But I can't stop myself.   Maybe my subconcious thinks that if it stab at my emotions enough times, they will die. That doesn't help any.  Here are two poems I wrote this evening. I guess I should leave them together.    Meadowlark   Give me the sun! and the meadowlark danced in the growing light swift upon the currents of air darting from light to shadow  singing out a ballad  give it to me, great ball of fire let me arc in and out of its brilliance  to be born anew Phoenix meadowlark true to the eternal youth of flight re-birthed a bird of fire!  and in the gathering day the meadowlark soared mightier than the eagle flying fast upon the powerful wind higher and higher into the sky singing Give me the sun! climbing still higher  the meadowlark then plummeted a nosedive for the field of its birth wailing its heart out ready to turn up at the last moment and singing Give me the sun!  behold! the sun has broken over the trees and the meadowlark turned to see the glory and fell entranced to the hard ground all the wile singing of the sun  it had finally captured!   Sea Glass   It rains behind the window the sky beyond the rustling leaves of the cottonwood dimly spread with clouds, a storm moving over the face of Gaia and for a moment the wind is still  it is my confession that I leave clues in all I write that tell my secret thoughts, encoded letters for no one to know I write it now in slow, deliberate strokes Keys to my life on the paper Already tearing me open Yearning to burn this concession  of something I would have forgotten writing as darkness is falling an artifice sun to light the ink while rain is falling on the leigh of wildflowers that sits undeveloped behind the house water dropping on the wild grass  it has been a hard day and now that I find it over, it lingers the light of the sun remains after it has set as I write I wait for it to die and leave the earth alone for once for just one night  what I may want is a core and I find it a sore lack looking to the dictionary I see that 'Leigh' is not a synonym for field as I once thought but only a title I learn that twins share more than one name before I put away the reference  the night crawls into my head and eats my mind as I type and when it is gone  I sleep  and here it is left this, a message of my love in a bottle corked with cryptography; cast onto the ocean left to drift half hoping it will fall onto a reef and crash in the waves, breaking upon the rocks to be found a hundred years from now as smooth pieces of amber sea glass.   _____________________________________________________________ ****HYPOCRISY IS THE GREATEST LUXURY****     Spoil yourself at     The Hypocrisy Entertainment Network     http://www.hypocrisy.org
