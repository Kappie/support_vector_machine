I did get to so some cool stuff at Universal, and swim in the Gulf, and we stopped and saw this really awesome Titanic exhibit. If anyone's ever passing though the Orlando area, I encourage them to go find it. It's called Ship of Dreams, and you get to go inside reproductions of some of the rooms on board, and then you stand outside on the deck, and it's really cold... Their attention to detail is amazing. It was a really moving thing to go through, especially for me, as I was a pretty huge Titanic buff for a while there until I'd learned pretty much everything. After we left I played the soundtrack to Titanic the Musical in the car. That's a good musical. You know. "No moon, no wind/ Nothing to spy things by/ No wave, no swell/ No line where sea meets sky/ Stillness, darkness/ Can't see a thing, says I/ No reflection, not a shadow/ Not a glint of light meets the eye/ And we go sailing, sailing/ Ever westward on the sea/ We go sailing, sailing/ Ever on go we..." This is material perhaps better suited to my lj. I'll talk about it there later.   Marten, sorry I wasn't here for your birthday. Happy birthday! (throws confetti)  Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.
