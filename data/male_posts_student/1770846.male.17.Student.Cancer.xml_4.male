Investors were startled by a price range of up to $135 per share.       One hundered ad thirty five dollars per share?! JESUS! I really wish I were involved in this IPO, haha. I can't wait until I'm in the business world building up a company and taking it public. It's times like this when it really makes me realize how much I wanna be doing what they're doing, haha. Someday...          According to Thomson Financial, at $3.3 billion, Google would rank as the eighth-largest IPO by a U.S. company.       Jeeeeeesus...
