I took pictures, recorded stuff, and talked to relatives of whom  no clue  of their relation to me. And my uncle who was hosting the thing had his dog running around, slobering on everything. *twitch, twitch* If America was a dictatorship, and I were running it, I would have a huuuge dog genocide. It'd be like Hitler's, only mine would make sense. But anways, it was never too boring considering what it was. My mom did a great job planning it all.  These entries are getting so vague. ;)
