After the warning from my brother and the very nice man who brought out our food at the House of Blues tonight, I still had to take a bite of the Habanero.  Its not like I didn’t know how hot it was going to be.  Its not like it was a test of manhood or something that was a challenge to me.  I guess I was just very curious.  One of those things where you just have got to do it, although it’s hard to explain why.  Human nature.  Curiosity killed the cat… or at least gave him horrible diarrhea.  Man, that pepper shot right through me.  Was good though, and oddly enough worth it.  But Sammy didn’t let me hear the end of it… =)  So tonight was awesome.  Now why do you ask “but isn’t it Friday?”  Well, yes, but my internet has stopped working so I am now writing this on Word, to be posted tomorrow (today).  Yup.  This was most definitely the best night I have had in a long while.  Really.  Was super cool.  House of Blues was awesome.  Really good food and a kick ass atmosphere.  May I recommend the Jambalaya and the banana bread pudding.  Killer.  Really.  Just DON’T EAT THE HABANERO.  (Unless you are like me)  During my date, I received a call from Nino saying that he was going to be home this weekend.  That’s cool, cause I miss the boy, and now I get to just hang out.  I gotta call him back tomorrow to figure out when we can hang out.  So yeah, after a wonderful dinner, I happened to run into one Geoff Bacci going to the Better than Ezra concert there.  If I had known that they were playing, I might have bought tickets, but I guess they aren’t high on my list of bands that I absolutely  must   see.  So whatever, we went and saw the Ladykillers instead at the Quarry. Pretty good movie, although I must admit, it was a tad bit over even my head.  Maybe if I had been more in the mood for an English black comedy, it would have a bit better.  But it most definitely had its moments.  Also, the brief ending of the movie was a bit of a shock to me.  Once again, if in the mood, I probably would have found that hysterical.  Oh well.  Learned lots about IBS.  Yup.  I really did have a fun time tonight.  Its nice to be able to joke around again and just be myself.  Not like I haven’t been doing that a lot, but I feel like the myself that I am now is not the myself that I used to be, and I like it better the way I used to be.  I think I just brood too much now.  I dunno.  The more I brood on it, the more I think this way.  ARGH!  Dammit!  Slap me next time I do that.  Well, since my internet is down and I don’t really see any other way of entertaining myself, I think I’m just going to go to bed.  Possibly have to work tomorrow (today).  So to recap: Tonight = Rock    Oh, and asshole, DON’T EAT THE HABANERO  Ride or Die (for GMX)
