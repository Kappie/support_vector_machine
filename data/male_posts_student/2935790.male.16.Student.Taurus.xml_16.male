Clutch  is a good movie. Somewhat indie, Canadian, 1998, Tom Green (not-so-good) cameo, makes you tick. It's a dark comedy in the greatest sense of the term, well...A good sense of the term. The only thing in the movie that unfolds to be crazier than the plot itself are the characters in it. The writer/director Chris Grismer seems to be kind of an amateur, very talented, obscure kind of guy, at least to the extent that he projects himself in the movie...I mean, I thought at times my sense of humor was morbid, but I'd  never  be able to pull it off like he did in the movie. I'm gonna go ahead and use the line  if you haven't seen the movie, go rent it before you read the rest of this . Actually, I don't want to review it, I'm not good enough to put it into words, so let me rephrase that to  go rent the movie , and I hope you'll like it.  That's it for Clutch...Other than that, this has been a decent fake holiday weekend. I think my dog has done more for Canada by fertilizing grass than the Queen has in her whole life (all what, six-hundred and thirty years?). Yes, that is something to be proud of Queen Victoria, you were born...But wait! I was born too! We all were! Well most of us. Yes, the Queen is about as useful as all the bullcrap traditions that take place in Canadian government. Useless. Wanna cut back taxes? Use some tax money to buy a noose for the Queen and all other 'royalty'. Where do they get money for diamonds, nice dresses, and being the only people in that entire area with good teeth? I don't remember seeing the Queen flipping burgers when she was young. I suddenly understand why other countries, ie USA, make fun of Canada. We're faggots! Okay, so Canada isn't that bad, but the overseas government and everything ever related to it is incredibly stupid, and should die. The end. No more Queen.  Goodnight!  Sean
