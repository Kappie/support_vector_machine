In one race.., Nine contestants, all physically or  mentally disabled, assembled at the starting line for the 100-yard dash. At  the gun, they all started out, not exactly in a dash, but with a relish to  run the race to the finish and win.        All, that is, except one little boy who stumbled on  the asphalt,  tumbled over a couple of times, and began to cry. The other  eight heard the boy cry. They slowed down and looked back. Then they all  turned around and  went back......every one of them.        One girl with Down's Syndrome bent down and kissed  him and said, "This will make it better." Then all nine linked arms and  walked together to the finish line. Everyone in the stadium stood, and the  cheering went  on for several minutes. People who were there are still  telling the story. Why??        Because deep down we know this one thing: What  matters in this life is more than winning for ourselves. What matters in this  life is helping others win, even if it means slowing down and changing our  course.        If you pass this on, we may be able to change our  hearts as well as someone  else's. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- "A  candle loses nothing by lighting another  candle" -----------------------------------------------------------------------
