(motorcade of generosity, which i couldn't find until the other day so i bought it.... great cd...i reccomend it) i've got my altoids strips... and my soy milk so i can eat cereal without dying from pain after (milk sucks wang.... it eats my stomach alive...) so right now i'm all good.... despite the gf issue.... i'm ok.... i just need to well... shit its one o' clock in the morning... i prolly should get to bed soon huh?  screw that... whats four or five hours of sleep ... jk... hope all is well with everyone (and by everyone i mean brian ... cause i think you are the only one who reads this... or at least the only who signs my guestbook) ..... maybe its good that you are the only ... i don't know if many other people would understand my ramblings as well as you do... sorry to anyone who may be reading this besides brian (highly doubtful) ....ok.... well i guess im out.... my body says stay up... PARTY! .... but my brain says... hmm tomorrow is going to suck major wang unless you go to bed... and honestly i dont need the extra stress... after... oh yeah ... i kind of tweaked out on thurs. and fri..... i dunno why ... but it was kind of scary... all of the sudden simple things like making small decisions and shit was kind of hard.... and bigger stuff like doing homework was ridiculously impossible... i was also EXTREMELY moody... i dunno...  i felt trapped or something... it was fucked up.. i feel a little better now... partly because i took a mental health day on friday and didn't do much this weekend except go to that party.. which if you read my last entry didn't help my tweaking at all.. but yeah... ok i have rambled on for about fifteen minutes longer than i wanted to ... bed time... good night america....
