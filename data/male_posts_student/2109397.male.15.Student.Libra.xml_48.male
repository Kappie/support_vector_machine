Our first game was at 10 and I stayed at Derks house because I dont trust my family to get me there. So first game we were playing Mockingbird White. They're in National League and ranked like 3rd in the state or sumthin. We have had bets going around about how bad we were going to lose and crap, you see we are bad and we hadnt won a game.  I was starting in goal and I was really nervous about letting the team down and crap. So, they were really good and we both started off really well. We were actually very even throughout most of them first half. They had much better chances but we both had an equal amount. I had like 3 good saves which made me happy and to our surprise we went into the break 0-0. We were hyped. As I was going to the sideline the manager approached me and asked if I wanted to finish out the game(I usually split halves with the other goalie) and I said Hell Yeah! I wouldnt have let him play the second half anyways. So we kept at it in the second half but we didnt have as many chances. About 20 minutes or so left Joey sent a cross in and their keeper went up for it and got it. Josh was standing there and form my vantage point just stood there but the keeper fell into him and practically threw the ball into the middle and Lucas put it away. We went CRAZY. I sprinted upto midfield to greet everyone I was STOKED. But we had 20 minutes left to play. We really dug the fuck in. They had the best player in the state by far and our D just shut him down. I had a couple of other good saves but for the most part they either missed the goal or the defenders blocked it. They were getting really frustrated and they kept getting corner after corner and chance after chance but nothing went in. Then on some free kick they crossed it in and some kid blasted it over the bar. I took my time going to get it, and I took the goal kick. Once our player touched it the ref blew the whistle to end the game. WE FUCKING WON! We went fucking crazy, everyone was jumping everywhere and on everyone. Our first fucking win against the best team we had played all season. And Mockingbird was pissed but we really deserved it, we really did.  So after that we had a game at 4 but that was like 4 hrs from then so we all hung out at Embassy Suites and ate at Denny's. We were all talking about how now we could make it to the semifinals and stuff... getting way ahead of ourselves. We had played the next team already, and lost 3-2 (I scored lol) and if we won we would advance.  That wasnt the case at all, we were drained from the first game absolutely drained. We went down 4-0 ealry in the second half and luckily took 2 back and made it 4-2 in the end. It really jepordized our chances.  So we were to take on another team we had lost to, LSA on Sunday at 8. I had to wake up at 5 fucking o clock in the morning. So I was starting in goal cuz it was my turn and I didnt play the last game because of the little deal or w/e.  I didnt give up any goals or anything and we were up 2-0 at half. We needed to win 4-0 and have Mockingbird beat Jackson Purchase by 1 to advance. Well we went on to win 5-0, with a goal by me, thank you very much. But Mockingird ended up beating JP 3-0 so we were eliminated by goal differential. The reason is cuz there was a 3 way tie at the top and the tie breaker is supposed to be head to head EXCEPT when there is more than 2 teams, then it is GD. But, the most goals that can count towards your GD in a game is 4 which sux so the only way was for Mockingird to win by 1. So it sux but considering we won our first 2 games of the season and beat a fucking national league team I was satisfied. Also a lot of heads were turned in our direction and we had a lot of fans from other teams within our club, it really felt "special" lol.  So on a somewhat other subject, I was talking to this girl online about State Cup and she had these friend on Mockingbird. Se was like " I heard you won on a bullshit goal by running into the keeper" I was like " I didnt have a very good view of it but it was something like that" and then I said "but we still shut them out so yeah" and she was like "I also heard that a lot of their shots missed the goal". I thought well wtf do you expect. Then I commented abot a save I had made on one of her friends and she was like "well which foot did he shoot with" I thought " why the fuck does it matter BITCH" then she was asking how certain ppl played etc. and there was this guy who has this really hard shot we were talking about and she was like "well _____ still goes to physical therapy" and I asked why and apparentyl he broke his hip sometime back. He has only been on crutches once at Ballard so it musta taken place like last year. I was thinking and wish I said " WHO THE FUCK CARES, GET THE FUCK OVER IT YOU STUPID BITCH QUIT MAKING EXCUSES FOR YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS WHO LOST TO US BECAUSE WE WERE THE BETTER TEAM GOD FUCKING DAMNIT!" and I have always hated this girl because she always seems to find a way to turn something negative or bitchy.  And that wasnt the end of it. She was like "dont u guys play LSA? and didnt you lose to them?" I was like " yeah but it was a fluke" and she was like "That's not what I heard" I was like alright bitch FUCK YOU YOU ASIAN LITTLE MAN VOICE WHORE SLUT. Like give it up. So we beat that team 5-0 the next day in her face.  I really hate her A LOT and I wouldnt care if she read this.  That's all I can stand to type for now.
