The opening credits just did it for me, just to see Audrey walking alongside Tiffany's with her coffee and croissant was bliss, so casual, so sympathetic, a wonderful way to begin a wonderful movie. I have for sometime now always admired the appearance and iconic figure that is Audrey Hepburn, but i had never seen any of her movies. This film for me was so good that i could have cried tears of joy from watching it. I lost count of how many times her character said 'darling' but just to see how the romance blossoms between Holly and Fred - it was truly wonderful. I don't think i have watched a film that has made me feel so good since the first time i saw American Beauty. American Beauty is a masterpiece, the way that the film involves the watcher is just unbelievable - to see how the different characters find beauty in so many different things is amazing, i loved this film - i still do, and i believe that it will always have me smiling at the tragic ending, or on the other hand crying...come to think of it the last film i cried at was Bicentennial Man, i really enjoyed that movie but the ending was so sad yet such a nice way to end it, gave me that feel good factor that everyone deserves at the end of a good movie - and its an intelligent film as well, made me appreciate some things a little more. You know what i mean ?
