((my clock is 8 minutes fast, so i put everything at nice even times that arent right. i.e. 8:15=8:07)) yes...then i wake up at 6 30ish, cause ceci is yelling at me to get up. lol...i wait a little, then go to the bathroom..decide not to turn on the light, it was too bright..i take a towel and lie down on the bathrooms carpet floor...and i feel asleep. Thank God only for like 15 minutes. I didnt expect too..i just wanted to be alone in the dark without sleeping and getting up at 7:15. ack. So i had a good sleep, that i desperately didnt want to wake from. i think tomorrow ill try to hsower in the dark instead of falling on the floor like im having hangover.  AHH this si such a good song....give it to me baby..uh huh uh huh...uno dos tres..ya know its kinda hard..som,ething something...today..our subject isnt cool but he thinks it anyway..thats awesome song. i remember my friend mom, when i was in 3rd grade, calling it the sexy song of the summer to someone. i get in my little..thing. i ahd this really weird thing id id when someone mentioned ANYTHING about like...'sex'..'baby'....any word ANYTHING like that. i was psychotic.
