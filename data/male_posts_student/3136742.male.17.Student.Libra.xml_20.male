If I can get one of my UMAXs up and running I'll put all my music on the tower of hard drives and set up an internet radio station where you can stream individual songs or whole playlists. I'll also be able to do my blogging from there, once I figure out html, so I'll be able to post all the funny pictures, videos, and other shit I have... That'll take a while to get into production though  NP: Oysterhead, The Grand Pecking Order- Birthday Boys
