Unlikely enough that I may have to retire this Blogspot just as I retired my Xanga.  After retiring this Blogspot, I might get some more good ideas and start up a Live Journal or something.  Then when I run out of ideas again I'll retire that Live Journal and so on.  You get the pattern.  So, what I'm trying to say is:  Give me some ideas and save me the trouble of retiring an online journal just to start another... or something like that... Ok, leave a comment then go away.   Later, after publishing this post : Blogspot seems to hate me.  Besides making new post infinatelyharder to write, it has also decided that all of my previoius post should be entirely in bold.  Damn piece of junk.  Anyway, I'm too lazy to fix it right now so live with it.   Later, after publishing this post a second time :  I seems that Blogspot has fixed the problem by itsel... I mean being the genius that I am, I fixed the bold problem... with ease.  As you can see, Blogspot is no match for my genius. =P  - Some loser
