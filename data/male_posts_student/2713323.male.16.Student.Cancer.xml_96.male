LAST WEEK OF THE JUNE HOLS. i went to orchard and brought ryan to cut his hair, which was damn kickass and nice. but unfortunately, being the old-fashioned self he already is, he didnt liked it very much and commented on it in front of the stylist, saying "it sucks". omg felt so embarrassed. but ahh, brother la. that will be the last time i'll bring an indonesian for a haircut. YES THAT WAS RACIST. heh. i sat around after that and waited for my dumb sis to meet me, who was still at the house doing her stuff at 6.30. so i left for the funeral (yes another one of grandmother's sister died). it was my 2nd time going there, 1st time on mrt/bus. when i reached Kovan station through the LRT, i took bus number 112. i was told to look out for xinmin primary school which i thought was "sing ming". okay. so i sat the bus foolishly, and waited and waited till i reached hougang bus interchange (what the hell). yeah i got lost. being the stubborn person i was and not wanted to "lose" to directions, i treked all the way back to blk 500++ from blk 200++. (the blk was supposed to go to was 645) and my godmum was worried and so was my mom, and so the many people whom they told there that i was lost, random uncle/aunties #2418-7859. they kept calling and told me to take a cab. so i thought, ah screw it. i hailed for one and got there, which i later realised was just a few more blocks away. taxi fare showed it all. dammit. ok, my first step into the funeral was accompanied by hundreds of questions and people wiping my face with tissue, and my second step was accompanied by another bunch of questions, this time with people fanning me and lifting my shirt in an up and down motion. so when i finally took a seat and settled down with a calsberg, i had to answer to question like, 1. hows your studies? 2. how old are you? 3. why are u so skinny? 4. i heard you have a girlfriend? 5. show her picture... 6. hows your dad? 7. hows school and yada yada, all in hokkien of course. and once i showed them the picture of hui, all of them were like, "aiyoh ah boy ah, li gai char bo peng you si bei knia leh!!" which means, "aye boy, your girlfriend is very pretty". well, of course. shes my girlfriend ain't it. heh, EEEEGGGGOOOO. okok my dads nagging at me, write another when i return.
