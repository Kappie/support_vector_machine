You make me smile to the point where it hurts, but in a good way :).  And your memory is amazing lol.  I got up at around 9:30 today for absolutely no reason.  Yeah yeah, it may not be that early but I didn't have to get up yet.  Cleaned up because my Mom's friends were coming over, got in the shower, did everything else associated with getting ready.  I had the especially interesting task of driving 4 boys to Subway.  Stephanie wants me to try on some womens' pants lol.  Make fun of me all you want... but I just may...  Yeah, if I had said this awhile ago I would've been embarrassed, but who cares, I'll wear what I like and grow my hair how I like it and it won't phase me if someone else doesn't like it.  I really really hope it stays clear tonight, I want to look at the stars and lay in the grass.  And think.  Yeah, this is really bad grammar but I've decided who cares lol.  I'm in such a good mood, I know it doesn't sound like it but I am, trust me.  I love you all.  I really do.  --Aaron  and I decided to throw in this thingy  Copy and paste into your livejournal.
