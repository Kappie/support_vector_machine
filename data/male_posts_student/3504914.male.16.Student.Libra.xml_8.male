Why Am I pissed off? Because i'm reading this book My solution? I stop reading this book!   What's the title of this book, I hear you ask. "How to be a Happy Teenager". Yes, I hear you, you're asking yourselves "What? Our beloved Damien is reading a self-improvement book? What in God's name?" Well, i'll tell you this. I'm only reading it because the old man wants me to. Why? Well, let me tell you a little story of what happened the day I got my report cards back.   I was lounging in my room, cool and suave, when suddenly I heard the door to my house open, and I knew my parents had returned from the school, and thus, had finished picking up my grades. The dull, patterned footsteps of my father raised up the flight of stairs, and  I decided to face my fears of him shouting in my face for getting a C in math.   But lo and behold, he shouted at me for not getting a B in computer! Ah, computer class, and a computer teacher who's so fucking retarded that you could stone him to death with jelly and he wouldn't realise it until he's lying in the ground dead. Well, he probably wouldn't realise it even then.   Back to my story. I argued with my dad, and I am within reason for this. I know I deserved more than a fucking C for computer. I told him my teacher is a complete idiot and etc, and that if I saw him any time soon I would speak to the bastard myself. My father seemed to accept this, but with him, he never lets up.   Two days later, he tells me and my sister he's got this book called "How to be a Happy Teenager". Now, I once more protest, and tell him that those books are bollocks, and that i'm happy enough with my life as is. He tells me that I should be more acceptant of other people's ideas, and that not everything I don't like is stupid. He told me that if I truly liked my life, why did I get a C for computer.   I lost my mind, and went into Crazy Dammo mode. I told him once more that its my fucking teacher who's at fault here. And then the truth slipped out from him. My com teacher had told my father "I don't enjoy programming". Now, allow a moment to ponder this. Why, if I don't like programming, do I have Visual Basic on my computer? Well, I let my father ponder that very question, and he did not have an answer.   But, regardless, I am now forced into reading this crap arse book all because my fucking computer teacher gave me a fucking C. That cunt crapping fool.   Well, i'm off until thursday-friday, 'till then my splendid readers, Dammo Out.
