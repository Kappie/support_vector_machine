I dont remember all of the things that happened, but i had a pizza from town, and it made me ill. ITS BREAD, CHEESE AMND TOMATOS. Wtf in that could have made me ill?! Then there was the stack.... this stack is so legendary! Im on my way home, skating past the river (bet u think u know what happens :D) when i suddenly stopped. There was no stone, i checked. The wheels are fine, i just stopped! Divine intervention? who knows. All i know is that i now have a red patch on my knee and my holey (...^_^) jeans now have an extra hole in them and probably wont be worn again. Ugh  Old news - Camping. Im sure that you have either read an account from sarah or Joe's blogs, and it seems like a waste of my energy to type it all again. so i wont! And im not gona rub it in peoples faces that we DIDNT  get hurt/lost/arrested. Im glad they cared about us enough to warn us. ta guys, but have a lil faith in us! :D  what else?.....   Today, Fathers day! I bought my dad a golf ball monogrammer! it puts his initial on it (or random/ rude phrases!!!!) and its re-useable! i had much to drink, and as a result am entirely not tired. If i had credit i would be texting all you guys so bad!!!  i cant think of anything else, but seeing as i havent got any gossip, i think that im gona post the first ever   !-!Dave watch!-! Little Dave is this bird that follows me around. I think im gona post when and where i saw him if i have no gossip! Little dave was up in tile kiln this morning, and then spent the evening at my grandparents, eating the bread i threw for him. !-!/Dave watch!-!  .... ok that sucked a little bit...  lets hope i find some gossip huh?  Random thought 1 - i like that new britney spears song.... s'calming Random thought 2 - I just farted.  ah well, untill next time kiddos! Keep it safe Naked-Veg :D
