This is actually going to be my first full design that's completely mine.  I've designed lights previously at  urlLink Jenny Wiley Theatre  for Children's Productions and a talent show.  My first design that I'm really proud of came this past summer when I was given the opportunity to design for a cabaret-style show called, "Hooray for Hollywood: An Evening of Song in Film".  The number that brought down the house was the most fun to light... a song from the musical, "CHICAGO" ... the  urlLink Cell Block Tango .  JWT even put it as a  urlLink publicity shot  on their website.  But for the cabaret, I used someone else's light plot and worked with that.  For Studio Players... it's  urlLink all mine !    I'm really excited, but my only question is how do I express that without sounding like I'm bragging or too proud?  I don't think anyone else will be as excited as me, and a lot of people don't quite "get it" I guess.  Maybe someone will and will pat me on the back a bit.
