Just checked ebay, no cimbaloms for sale, but there was 1 CD with a guy performing on the cimbalom. Pfft.  Well, the homework isnt as bad as i'd thought it would be, but it's more than i had last year. I have to bring spirals to class now! Grrr...  You know what i just realized? I have NOTHING important to say! Nothing! Other than i'm totally psyched about this lockin on saturday because it's gonna kick ass, NOTHING is important right now!  Hey, charley, if you read this...  "And drumbone soup... and a drumbone TV special... and drumbone SOCKS!"
