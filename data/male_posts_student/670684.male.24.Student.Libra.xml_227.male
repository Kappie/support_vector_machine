But I'm in Rogers...the high school hometown...area of some great conquests that were forgotten quickly, replaced by the smell of chicken pellet and Wal-Mart.  And yes, Wal-Mart smells.  When you face contorts, and you sniff the air, unable to discern what the problem is, but you know there is a problem around you, that is the evil of Wal-Mart.    The trip up should have been incredible.  Some of my friends hate flatlands...they tie it to a need for physical harm or suicidal tendencies.  I love a good flatland drive, where the road is straight, the grass is green, the sky blue, the clouds white, and there is nothing remarkable on the canvas except you and your thoughts.  My best writing is done in the car, and the drive from Dallas to Rogers is usually the best drive to think during.  Not only that, but I knew I would be stopping in Muskogee, OK, home of some of the world's shittiest liquor stores, where I am able to buy some of the world's shittiest beer.  Since some readers of this blog will be drinking some of this beer, I will withhold the names of said beer found in Muskogee until after said beverages are consumed.  I will say that I outdid myself, and for cheap.    Northwest Arkansas has a pretty good 80s station now; since I didn't bother to hook my portable CD player up before I started driving, I was tickled delicious when the signal was clear enough to listen to Madonna, Toni Toni Toni, and Human League.  The sun was shining, my arm was crisping golden brown, I was cooking at 78 on the Cherokee Turnpike, 54 cans of god-awful beer lay in my passenger seat, and so when the hawk darted out in front of the car, I assumed it would do its usual bird thing, and glide out of the way of the car at the last minute.  It didn't.    You can see the wingspan of the beast on the roof of my car...you can see the mark of the entire bird on the car, in what eerily resembles a white chalk outline.  Ten inches lower and the bird comes through the windshield, and the worry about what was just a misaligned oil filter would be trite compared to replacing an unwarrantied winshield.  And it upset me that one of my first thoughts, after a few minutes of calm deliberation, turning off the music, and driving stoically along the turnpike, was that I was glad the bird died the few inches above my windshield that it did.    Two years ago, I hit a dog in Shreveport.  I was in the yellow Volvo with Jessica Stewart (no one more than a friend), driving back from an IHOP meal of grease and carbs, when we passed through the Southwood light.  I was crusing at 40 when two dogs ran out into the road.  I put on the brakes and swerved to the left, avoiding one dog, but plum smacking the other.  I slowed down and watched as the dog I hit got up and pitifully limped away.  I wanted to turn back, but Jessica said no.  She was too busy laughing.   You hit it!  she kept saying, chortling sounds and shaking in the passenger seat.  When she'd calm down, she'd remind me of the look of horror on my face and start laughing again.  Months later, when she confronted me about my lack of interest in her sexually, I felt no shame in letting her down hard.    Remind me to talk about a wonderful musical number I saw in a movie today.  Not in the mood right now.
