They would be at the fore front on any religious issues concerning any other religion. When it comes to Hindus Communists would be no where to be seen. They are "secular" you see, they cannot interfere in Religious matters. When it comes to extending the Haj Pilgrimage or increasing the Stipend to the Haj, they would come out and support any kojoling up actin by the Govt, but not in the case of HIndus. It happens only it India( Read it like the popular song)
