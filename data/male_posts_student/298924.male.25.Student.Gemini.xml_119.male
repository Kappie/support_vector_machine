I graduated from Morehouse a little before my 22nd birthday but that was easily the best moment of my young life....  The evening of January 1st, 2002 is easily the worst few hours of my life as my dad's life hung in the balance and he came within a few minutes of dying....  This year has taught me alot about who I am....  I started medical school, an accomplishment that I think I take for granted more often than not....  I also moved away from Atlanta and started to gain some independance (bills)....  I have established good credit (let's keep it this way)....  I have gotten closer to my sister Nina (subject of a post all its own soon enough)....  I have gained some really good friends here in Nashville....  I lost my grandmother and aunt....  But I think the most important thing is that I have lived another 365 days....more hard days than easy ones, but I have the feeling that these days are going to be the ones that shape my life forever....I know that I will always remember the year I was 22....someone very wise said you should always be careful what you wish for....I think I wished that I would never ever forget my 22nd year of life....well the Almighty has made certain of that....I will never forget it....
