It's also good excercise, so I'm not passing on that oportunity-especially with the racing season coming up pretty quick. I already got 10 bucks from the neighbor lady for helping her out-I've been doing it for free for a while, so I think it was good to get paid. Now for my driveway, sidewalks, stairs, etc. etc. etc.  What a coincidence-a snow day on a Friday, which happens to be the day after the best night of my life-all 15 years. How could it get any better...?  It doesn't seem too bad outside for a bike, so today I'll be going places. yay! Well, it's a damned fine day-10 bucks in the wallet (lol) and more coming, a day without homework, and it's the weekend. And that means seeing friends. Woot! Oddly enough, with me not sleeping too well last night-I kept waking up all the time, I feel quite energized. I hope it doesn't end.
