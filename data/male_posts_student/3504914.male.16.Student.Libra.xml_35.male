Of course, this is good if I’m currently in a relationship, but this year has found me empty handed. And now, I have seen two romantic comedies in one day. Three if that’s what you classify  Meet Joe Black  as.     NOW, what the fuck is up?     First,  Rules of Attraction . Or is it  Laws of Attraction . Fuck me dead, I don’t remember. This was forced upon me, by oh dear cousin Krys. Not forced, more… I felt it my obligation not to argue with the movie choice. Scarily enough, I didn’t have too many problems with the movie, it was less flawed then let’s say  Troy  or  Return of the King , two movies shit-note-worthy.     Second,  Love Actually … Shite, I actually like this. Let’s not go any further… Except Keira Knightley is the hotness xD     I apparently need sex, I think that’s the piece of advice I’ve received that has beaten around the bush the least. Of course, the sex could just be a metaphor for some kind of physical relationship. With some people you never know xD
