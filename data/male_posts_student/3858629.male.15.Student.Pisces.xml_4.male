You'll be given love    You'll be taken care of    You'll be given love    You have to trust it        Maybe not from the sources    You have poured yours    Maybe not from the directions    You are staring at        Twist your head around    It's all around you    All is full of love    All around you        All is full of love    You just aint receiving    All is full of love    Your phone is off the hook    All is full of love    Your doors are all shut    All is full of love    All is full of love, all is full of love    All is full of love, all is full of love ...
