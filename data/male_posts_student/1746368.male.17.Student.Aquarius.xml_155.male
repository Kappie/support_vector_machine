I have decided to discontinue  Twice Double   AS A BLOG . All this means is that  Twice Double Forums  is still up, the blog edition is now renamed back to Colin's life. I have more or less started with a new blog. I haven't posted in this one since around New Year's of last year, but I think we can all get over that.  Anyways, I have youth group, but maybe if I get back early enough I will chat a bit more with all of my old viewers and my new viewers. I guess you guys are readers too.  If you get bored, please, feel free to take a look at the archives. This is basically just my life from 2003. Thank you for your cooperation.
