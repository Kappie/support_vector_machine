I went to WinterFest 2004.  Let me tell ya. It rocked out! 20,000 screaming people were there and we had some church!! I mean it was awesome. I feel spiritually energized.  Oh yeah and March 13 was my birthday!! That's right I'm officially 15 writing this!! OH YEAH! I'm supposed to go and get my learners sometime this week. But who knows ya know, I'm so busy.  But anyway I stayed out of school yesterday, and I missed school Friday, so I have homework to be doing.
