I really hate going slowly around the place but it was worth it eat their Swedish meatballs, their speciality. So after that everyone else peruses for about 4 hours while I get somewhat bored. Finally we made our way out to the warehouse to get the furniture half is the stuff isn’t in stock. Ahhh! Thats so rubbish! Still we managed to get half a shelf, a draw and cupboard which has a gap in between the doors which I can’t seem to work out how to fix. Also a new computers chair which im sitting on now. It has hydraulics! I hope I don’t get too tempted to just play around with it like we use to in school :p In typical Ikea fashion absolutely everything is flat packed and we spent a good few hours assembling the stuff and it wasn’t pretty. Holes that were not aligned, screws which were too tight, instructions which were written by dummies who must have numbered the instructions wrong. Ikea = STRESS. I say all thats good about Ikea is its meatballs, you can forget the furniture just go eat the meatballs hahaha :p to add to this day of stress we have to take back some items as they are the wrong size, well was our fault I suppose but I don’t find the though of having to go back to the hell hole that is Ikea again -_-*.    So tomorrow, more painting, more sanding. Sounds good.....
