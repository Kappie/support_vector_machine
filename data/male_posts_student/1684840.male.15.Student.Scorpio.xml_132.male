My sprained ankle is healing nicely and I can walk again, but it still hurts :(  For some reason my blog posts recently have become a bit boring.  So I'm gonna try and make small things seem amusing lol, well, I dunno.  There's supposed to be a sleepover at Sam's this weekend, I'm not sure if anything else is going on.  I might go out if my ankle feels any better.  I'm still relaxing it on loads of cushions I pinched from the front room hehe.  Anyway, cya soon...
