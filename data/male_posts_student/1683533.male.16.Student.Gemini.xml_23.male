I was forced into believing something that I might not have been OK with.  And I am not OK with it anymore.  Catholicism is a corruption.  It always was.  When you go into World History in High School you will find out how corrupted it was.  Money hungry nobles and secular ideas....sigh....not only that but what is so great about a religion where old perverted preist molest little boys and get away with it?  I don't go to church anymore....
