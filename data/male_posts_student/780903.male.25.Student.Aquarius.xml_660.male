Most of what they've said's been relatively as expected... it's a lot of work, but obviously the rewards are good; the people are pretty nice in general; you get used to the work; etc.  The one surprising piece I've heard:  Apparently, there's a defined set of computers on which changes to articles can be entered -- so they have assigned "type-ins" where people sit at these computers and enter these changes.  And, apparently, there are enough changes to enter that people need to be assigned to these computers 24 hours a day.  So there are people with shifts like 1AM-4AM, or the like.  Crazy, ain't it?  Another thing I've heard re: law review -- law firms apparently like to hire these people.  And you wonder why.  :)
