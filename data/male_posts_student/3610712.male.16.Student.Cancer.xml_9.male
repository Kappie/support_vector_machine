My expectations for this summer are high, and if they go correctly, I will become a much more complete individual and will begin the new school year very prepared. My confidence is high after my chat with my English teacher Mrs. Nicastro so I feel quite well in that respect. I have created this blog to keep myself busy this summer, and also to log my goings-on and such. Not a Sophomore, not yet a Junior. I bear no academic title as of this point...I am the Prophet.
