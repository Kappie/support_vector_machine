Here's the latest news from the  urlLink Laurell_Hamilton  yahoo group:       SOS, Auction News, Dinner/Silent Auction to benefit Granite City APA      Support Our Soliders Dance in NYC and Florida ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------  Besides the dance there will be a silent auction and you know we donated  goodies for that!   Next week we're printing the SOS Gala Brochure (Wait till you see the snazzy  cover) and it will be up soon at our web site, giving details of Nov. 13.  Tickets for the day are $200 for local New Yorkers. The cost for Patriettes is  still $150 - but we may be sold out quite soon. At least reserve a ticket with  Nancy and pay later if you're definite about attending - nancy@romantictimes.com  .   We will have 25 "returned" soldiers (and "recovering") or more as our guests  during the day and more for the Dance Canteen. Due to the size of the  ballroom, we're limited to 300 for supper and sit-down functions. The Book Fair  and  Dance Party can accommodate much larger crowds. So the more the merrier for  these two events.   We're also working on a very special "Salute to the Flag" opening ceremony at  10 am and a "patriotic" candle lighting tradition. I think it will be a  powerful way to kick off our first SOS Saturday for the soldiers.   Catch it all at http://www.romantictimes.com   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   Lisa Berger Hosts Dance Night at Florida Ballroom, Nov. 11, Veterans Day   Dance Champion, Patriette, our own Terpsichore Lisa Berger will be hosting a  SOS America Benefit at a Ballroom in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, area on  Thursday evening, November 11. (The next morning she flies in to us on Jet Blue  to teach swing and jitterbug at our Gala.)   Email her at dance007@bellsouth.net, if you'd like to attend and watch some  great dance exhibitions. The entrance fee is minimal. Come alone or with a  dance partner. You'll meet other Patriettes.
