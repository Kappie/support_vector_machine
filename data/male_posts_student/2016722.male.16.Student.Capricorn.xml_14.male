I like how blogs can reveal things about people you could have never seen before. Its a little dangerous too. Anyway, Tina's latest post has been the biggest motivation not to be a typical American teenage lazy-ass in quite a while. Also, it compelled me to comment on the death penalty.  In general, justice done by death makes me feel uncomfortable. Say the person actually did kill somebody. That person has destroyed an opportunity for something good, so should the justice system just assume that the killer's only "purpose" in life is destruction and that he/she can never accomplish anything good? Say the system decides to try and turn that person around (psychological help, etc...), is the public socially responsible for whatever resources that are needed to help change that person? My conclusion comes from my inability to answer any of these questions. Because nobody can place any distinct value on any person's life, no one can judge whether or not someone should be killed for an equivalent act. Its hard to come up with an alternative solution. Life in prison doesn't seem much better, although at least you have time to think. Its probably impossible to design a program that can test a person's readiness to reenter the world. ERg, something as basic as a system of government becomes way too complicated way too quickly.
