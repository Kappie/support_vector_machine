First of all, I got there like ten minutes early and no one was there.  About 15 minutes after I got there Amber showed up and we talked about meteors that will eventually turn into fish.  Then three other Kraay Z Kidz showed up.  Sommer, Jessie, and Chadd rolled up in an escalade(not really,i just thought it would sound cooler).  Then Chad got there and went inside where all the old people were.  We went to the back and sat on the roof and those Kraay Z Kidz enjoyed a smoke while I told a joke.  So anyway, we had to put it out before we were done cause some old person came to the back of the building.  That was interesting.  We then decided it was our time to join the old people.  Upon picking a couple seats in the back, we discovered that we were not wanted.... in the back at least.  Those bitches made us sit in the front...  The lecturer was fucking insane.  He told all these jokes.  There was one especially funny one.  It went something like this, "The lord, Jesus Christ is coming back."  I laughed my ass off, silently of course, being that it wasn't one of those jokes that you're supposed to laugh at.  Usually after a lame joke(the type that is supposed to draw laughs) he would proclaim, "Can I get an amen brother?" to break the akward silence.  Then some old jackass in the back never failed to support the jerk up front and say "Amen, Bro."  No, you can't, you stupid piece of shit.  You've been saying stupid shit all day and getting amen's all fucking day.  I'm not going to give you one just because you're an asshole and told a lame joke.  Fuck I wish I had the crickets chirping sound effect.  That would have been priceless.  By the way, what is with old men's laughs.  Is it something that comes w/ age or something?  I've tried and tried to laugh like an old man, but it just doesn't work.  Molemonkey can laugh like an old man though...  but he doesn't count because he's got a chess piece in his mouth.  Apparently the belly laugh is one of those things you get when you turn 65.  Then during closing he asked all of us sinners to bow our heads, which I did for fear of looking like a jackass.  He then told us sinners to raise our right hand and ask the "lord" for forgiveness.  I nearly busted out laughing as I nearly said "FUCK YOU, YOU OLD FUCK."  Of course neither happened but the thought was there.  What a fucktard that man was.  Then, while everybody else had raised their hand and did their voodoo shit or whatever I still hadn't done it because I don't need forgiveness from some old man in the sky.  The old kid in front kept giving somewhat subtle hints that I should raise my hand.  He said stuff like, "Will the male teengaer with long hair in front please raise his right hand."  Then after a moment of akward silence he would give more hints like, "You know who you are.  About 6' tall and 140#'s.  Hazle eyes and a Kurt Cobain shirt.  You're wearing blue jeans."  "Well, thanks jackass, apparently even though I knew you were talking about me, you had to fully describe me.(slight exageration)  I was just too busy suppressing the fucking laughter to listen to you ramble on about forgiveness and all that other bullshit."
