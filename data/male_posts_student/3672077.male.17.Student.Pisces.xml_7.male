Looks like I'm taking up Tai-Chi which is really great! I've always wanted to learn a physical art and Tai-Chi definitely seems to be the way to go!   Well I better get back to my reading because I've been reading Sun Tzu's Art of War. What an amazing piece of writing! It's so deep in meaning and the concepts are so easy to apply to almost anything! Now if only they could decode a more non-metaphorical version of the Tao Te Ching! Just kidding... It's great how is already. Everyone get reading before you got no time when school starts again!
