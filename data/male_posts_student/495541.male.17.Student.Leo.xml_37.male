The 4th is not a final but it's a presentation day.  I only have that one final on Thursday, the last day and I have to be at school at 9:15.  I don't have a 4th hour final and the teacher said we don't even have to be there on Thursday so it's all good.  Today I had to lift after school.  I planned on skipping, but I'm glad I didn't.  I didn't lift on Monday because it was a holiday but some football guys went in early to lift but I didn't know about it.  Basketball coach told us we'd lift Tuesday and then Thursday.  I'm confused on who I should take orders from.  The varsity basketball coach is now also going to be the sophomore football coach.  Football is before basketball.  Shouldn't I follow football stuff?  I thought so too.  :-)  We ended up doing 1x100 reps of bench press.  I did just the bar.  That may not seem like a lot, but keep in mind it's 100 reps.  Think of it as 4500 once.  :-)  Then we did some other stuff which was odd.  Oh well.  I'm bored now and don't know what to say.  Later folks.
