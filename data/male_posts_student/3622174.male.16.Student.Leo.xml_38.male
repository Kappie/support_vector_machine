But does it live up to the expectations that have been set for games by the popular creator?  The answer is yes.  And no.  Glinx is fun, and addicting at first, but gets incredibly boring after around level 5.    In Glinx, you have to clear the board by forming chains of the same shape.  There are several shapes, and you want to form the biggest chains to clear the board quicker.  After around level 5, you'll begin to realize that it gets boring, even though new shapes show up, and obstacles block you from forming your chains.    If you want a good game, this might work, but, there are much better games to try instead of this one.  The graphics are simple, and forming your chains is easy, as well.     urlLink    Form huge chains by clearing the way and moving cursor over several blocks that aren't blocked by others. urlLink     Overall, this would be a good game to try, but not one to get addicted to and play repeatedly.  There are only 10 levels, so its rather short, and doesn't present much of a challenge.  GameHouse could have done better with this one, but, oh well.  Their other games are better.
