Today I had a shower for the first time in a long time, and now I'm clean and my hair is bouncy - more "volume" I think, but it keeps getting in my eyes, and I may suffer from sun burn more cos I have lost my pretective layer of dirt. Heh.  Now I am full, just had tea, and I ate too much, and soon I'm having fruit salad, yum. Oh yeh, and there is a comment thing now on this blog that you can leave comments on, so use it *points* yes that means *you*
