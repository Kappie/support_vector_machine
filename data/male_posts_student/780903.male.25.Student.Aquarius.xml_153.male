Yet on our list of elective choices are a whole bunch of classes that fall into those slots.  So the "list of 1L electives" included classes nobody can possibly take.  And yet the available slots in those classes are counted in the total number of available elective slots, meaning that instead of 550 students to choose from 1350 total slots for spring courses, it's really only about 1000 slots.  Hence they make us choose our top 8 elective choices.  Because some people may get choice #8.  Ick.
