I see you when you're sleeping, I smile at you when you awake I feel your soft touch Your fingers on my lips. You hold me close and whisper, Can this be my only dream? If I could I would Paint this on my memory  Because now that you're gone All I can do is remember. Time goes faster each day. With you, the day lasts forever. And even now, I can't believe it's all over I pull on my sweater  But the scent of you remains And in an instant I remember. I never thought it would end All I have are these remnants of you, So I have to admit that I miss you.
