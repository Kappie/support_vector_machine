Then he gave us work to do (my worksheets!). Everyone in class was cursing me for giving them so much work. lol. I'M EVIL!!! MUAHAHAHA... *so bizzare!  Well... We had the stupid history test today. It was supposed to be a revision of Semester 1's work which is like WHOA!! so MUCH.... but. it was like only 3 questions (open ended) There was question 1 part A plus B, then question 2 part A,B,C. and question 3. the questions were quite easy. it was like describe 2 problems farquhar faced and how he solved them. (3 marks question)  Then there was the 6 marks LORMS question... damn  Whatever, recess today was uneventful. Went with desmond to the library. Met koganti there. He was apparently doing some last minute IvP work. The IvP people had their IvP fair rehearsal today.... Meanwhile, desmond and I just rushed through our hcl newspaper report. the cl class is like so slack.. (wishing i'm there..) they dont have much work compared to us. Yah. Luckily, we managed to finish it in time just before the recess bell rang. Made it back to class...  Then it was like hcl? we didnt do much. It was just another 1 hour of slacking. * please note: though the lesson was slack, the work for that subject definitely isnt!!!  science was sex ed again...  just talking about pregnancy, ovulation, etc... etc... dont wanna talk about it. but yah Yeow Boon the great asked a question: "Who did these people find out about all these????"  Ms Ho juz said... Well it started in England. They experimented on animals. What animals do you think are very common in England???   Well I said, "Meerkats!!!"  Ms Ho: "WHAT?????? whAT DID YOU Say? Meerkats are in africa lah the savannah..."  Leon: "Yah I know.. But they are also Meerkats in the UK! Like a few weeks ago when I was there I saw more than 10 at the wildlife-cum-theme park @ Chessington.  --  Jeremy Suddenly cuts in: "When you're good to mama..."  Laughter drowns his voice. The whole class, including Ms Ho was howling with laughter.... In case you dont know, Ms Ho's previous msn nickname was "meerkat". Now, it is "When you're good to mama, mama's good to you."  LOL...  Today was another interesting day...  -----------------------------------------------------------  Tomorrow is the history drama rehearsal!!! So worried about Victoria's performance... Other gep schools will be coming... ACS, RI, NYGH, DHS... blah. gonna see my friends.  well bye.
