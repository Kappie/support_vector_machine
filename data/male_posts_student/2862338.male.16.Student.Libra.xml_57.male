Acutally, it was alittle more than that..so yeah, after that, i came back home, and just went to sleep.  I dunno, it might have been just me, but there was just....this  something  about it.  I mean, nothing really went wrong, ya know? sure i was late...and sure we had  ALOT  more fries than needed, but i mean, shit, it all came together.  Now, i don't know who put in what amount of money....i'm asumining mike and ben didnt put anything into it, but i could be wrong.  I myself, bought 3 sodas, i'm pretty sure Andy hooked us up with the broatworst, sabby with meat, Czank i'm guessing with the patatoes, and Dan with everything else.  And shit people, i don't really know why, but it just felt soo good to chill like that right? i mean, just relaxing, cooking, conversing, having a good time and shit, i mean, it was awsome.  And what was even better (and maybe kinda worse) about it was that ben and czank were there! i only say worse, cause it seems like we've eliminated the one key member of the krew, Rob, and replaced them with ben and Czank.  This whole vacation has been rob free so far.  We've known were he was though...apperently checking out colleges and shit.  But yeah, atleast he;s doing something productive....so far i've been out everyday since last friday..i'm surprised i even have money left.  Um, ya, just to reiterate, it was a breath of fresh air to just be chilling like that how we kinda used to do...Well, ya, during that, i acutally go tthe car, and jorge went to go drop me off to get it...along the way his mom called, and said something was up, but it appeared to be cool.  Anyway, i went back to dans, where the guys were doing NOTHING.  Before, we were gonna visit a freind steph were she worked in verplanck, so we said we were leaving...the guys looked dissapointed and shit, but honestly, they had to have realized that there was nothing to do...anyway, sorry for any dissapointments and shit...  Well, we spend like an hour looking for the place, have many inside jokes i guess, and ya, i  mean it eas pretty random.  That night, i shill with steph, sabby, and andy and Sabby's place until like 11...nothing really special, but good times none-the-less.    Um, oo, by the looks of it, i didn't really said what i did in the last post.  My dad ended up letting my borrow the car, and me, andy, and sabby headed over to the Premier athletic club over there in Montrose.  Now, alot of shit happened, so let me explain from the begging.  See, since last sunday we were planning to go right? so when the day came, steph calls, giving me the low-down on whats gonna happen, and she asked if i need i ride...i was like "no, i'll drive there" cause, of course, i wanted to drive there.  Now, the plan was that my mom was going to come home with the van, i get it, and pick up sabby and andy to go.  Well, i guess i shoulda have asked my mom first, cause she was gonna be in college until like 11...so yeah, pretty screwed, THEN, i was like, wait, i can get my dads car! but i had to wait until he got there, at around 6:30...well, he gets there, i pick the guys up, i miss the first exit, and we finally get there...like an hour and a half late.....yeah, it sucked...but we got there, and it was just like Club fit in briacliff....a pretty boy's club.  there was like NO ONE at the bench press area and shit....just pathetic....i didn't lift cause i had already previously did, so i went to the leg press, and couldn't even do 4 45 pounders on each side!! My legs' have seriously gotten weak, but i'll try to fix that during the summer.  Anyway, um, ya, so we stayed there for only about an hour....Christina had to go and what not, and we just left...we followed her, and dropped her off, then followed steph to get back home...my dad was alittle mad, but it's cool.     ok, so what gonna happen today? Well, jorge wanted to see if we can get a jam session going on, but by the looks of it, it ain;t happening, and steph, and Andy and i think some others want to go to to Priemir again, but i dun really want to go.....plus i still have to atleast try and do my HW....so yeah, i have no idea whats  gonna happen....but we'll see....ok, i might update later today...peace
