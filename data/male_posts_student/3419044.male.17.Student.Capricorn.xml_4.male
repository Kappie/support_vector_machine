Ok, that's a lie, I was actually sleeping until 4:00 so that is why it still feels like the morning to me.  Penny, left somewhere this morning and both Kent and Brandon had to work today.  Kent is still at the sweatshop and Brandon and I are in the computer room watching bike videos, etc. We Kent should be home any minute now so I will wrap this up.  Have a good Saturday night to the so many many people who read my blog!  Be responsible and stay clean... (roll eyes)
