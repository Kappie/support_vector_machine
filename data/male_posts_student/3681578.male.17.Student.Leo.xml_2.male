I do hope THE prince doesn't read this entry or he might strangle me...hehehe...oh well...  I hate Filipino!!!  super...and I have this bad vibes that I will be put in Basic Filipino...wahahaha, an additional sem of filipino...shit! fuck! damn!  anyway...on the brighter side, no Salazar!!! hurray! anyway, I'm not even sure...I'll find out on friday...  anyway...I'm medyo sleepy...bye!
