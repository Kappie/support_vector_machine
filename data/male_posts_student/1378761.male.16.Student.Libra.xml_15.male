Today we had a one hour delay. Should have been a two but ol well.  As you can see I have been updating the site more frequently because MSNBC stopped its streaming news service. So no I have to update it by hand (It looks better though). There saying we are suppose to get more snow tonight. Probably have another delay tomorrow. Wont bother me too much. Have to work this weekend. Both Friday and Saturday, still better than Sunday night. I have been working nights. I really want to work sat/sun mornings.  Cya Later
