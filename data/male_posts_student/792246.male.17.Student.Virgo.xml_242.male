Today I felt like I was doing pretty good, but by the time I parked my clock said "10:03", so I was still late. How annoying.  So I rush to the class and open the door, and find a strange female professor and a bunch of asian kids who I don't know.  Then my brain begins to wake up. My car clock was never reset for Daylight Savings Time shit. I got to school an hour early. Where is my brownie?
