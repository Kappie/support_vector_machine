He ate some breakfast/lunch/brunch and then he and his mom went over to his grandpa's house by Bell Square where his dad already was.  If you didn't already know, Tyke's grandfather is very much ailing right now and is seeing his final days most likely.  He is not cognizant of anything going on around him it seems and he is just lying on a hospital bed in the care of his family who happens to have some nurses and nurses-in-study which helps the cause for keeping him in their watchful eye.  He is not in pain anymore but he still seems to struggle at times and he is about as close to a coma as Tyke has ever been a witness to.  It is truly a sobering sight.  This was not a sudden happening as he has been faltering for a while now but on Friday he really got worse.  Now he is just waiting out what seems to be his final days.  Tyke stayed there with his mom and dad and his brother came over along with other family that was there and they talked and reminisced about the past.  Because this was not totally unexpected they were not all silent and crying but rather having some pleasant conversation all the while watching Tyke's grandpa for perhaps the last time.  Tyke has never been witness to anything such as this.  He has not had many really close experiences with death and certainly never been with someone on their death bed.  So this is something that really made him think.  His grandmother made a good point by saying that it is hard to be born and hard to die.  It's not like Tyke hasn't thought about death before but it seemed so distant before.  He never knows how he will cope with death but he is doing fine now.  It is really just a sobering experience as he said before.  It makes you think about so much and what you really want in life.  On Tyke's first drive back from Bellevue he just listened to slow music and just thought to himself how blessed he is.  Then he got some food and went down to IHS to help Dotti out with Young Life stuff.  They talked some and then Tina came down too.  So Tyke hung out with Dotti and Tina a lot while working to set up the commons.  Tyke hasn't really gotten to talk to Tina for a while so it was really nice.  It seemed much different than how they used to talk.  It seemed so much more relaxed and friendly than it used to.  That really made Tyke happy.  It showed him that their friendship was just how he wanted it to be.  And of course Tyke and Dotti danced and chatted their usual random thoughts which Tyke is apparently quite good at :).  It was just so nice to be around the people he wants to spend much of his time with and to be able to have casual conversation as the sun shone down on them and not have to worry about anything.  Purdy came down about 15 minutes before Tyke left and they didn't really get to talk but he still got to listen to her and Tina talk about college.  Tyke left there at 6 something and went back to Bellevue where his family still was.  Tyke got to have some pleasant talks with his brother about graduating and college and their trip this summer and Tyke might even drive to D.C. with his brother the first week in August when he heads off to law school at American University.  So Tyke could end up having a lot to do this summer.  And now he still has a lot to look forward to.  Like Dotti and Tina's birthdays as well as Cinco de Mayo with Tina and Purdy.  As Tyke has been writing this he has been listening to Coldplay and making himself more and more relaxed.  Right now he is very peaceful and in a serene state of mind.  Nothing seems to be bothering him.  No feelings of being alone in the world.  No feelings of frustration towards his romantic life.  No feelings of anger at anything or anyone.  All he wants is to be in the company of his close friends and family and cherish everything they give him.  For Tyke would be nothing without them.  He lives his life for them and wants to succeed to make them proud.  And although he always has and will talk about how much he longs for that special girl, he knows it will come and he knows it will be perfect when the moment arrives.  Until then Tyke will just enjoy the company he is in to the fullest.  That is what life is supposed to be.
