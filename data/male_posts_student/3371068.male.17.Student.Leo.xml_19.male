Emily and I got so drunk that we required help walking. I still dont know if Mandy and Emily got home alright. Matt got me home and we both passed out the second we entered my house sometime in between 2 and 4. I cant recall. My mom knows that I was drunk and shows a typical disregard for it. Kyle, by the way, stumbled home, almost got into a fight with a drunk, and broke the window in his basement in order to get into his house. Hells ya.
