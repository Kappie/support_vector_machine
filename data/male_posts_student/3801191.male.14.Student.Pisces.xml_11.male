Yup, happy memories of my childhood... old friends... birthday parties...*sighs*  I've come to realise somethin today...  Friends come...friends go...  But photos are always there to remind you of all the happy times u shared with them.  I also took some time to ponder this point, how many of my friends from the past are still my friends now?  Well, i found out one thing's for sure, friends may come and go...but true friendships ALWAYS survive the ravages of time and distance...as i found out recently.  Recently, i hooked up with an ex-neighbour of mine, Samantha. Now, ive lost contact with her for many years, but when we met up, we chatted and fooled around just like we did in the past.  Ok, backtrack a bit...lemme explain to u guys our past...  Samantha and I were great friends when we were young. We used to cycle together every afternoon, and do all sorts of crazy stuff together. Stealin rambutans (yes, i was too young to know jak shit bak then...lol), playin with mimosas, fooling around in the park...ar..too many things to mention! We did lots of stuff together, and our friendship grew and grew...  Till one day...that fateful day...the day i would never forget...  Well, it was pretty normal, but for some reason i still remember that day like no other...  I still remember the only strange thing that happened that day, was samantha was unusually quiet for some reason, and right after our usual 2 hour session of playin... she handed me a piece of paper and ran off crying...  I didnt really think much of it until that evening. I pulled the letter out of my pocket and read it...  The reaction was immediate, teras welled up in my eyes, and i cried...  She was movin the next mornin, and she didnt leave me with any contact no....  I was p5 bak then, and i had a hard time gettin over that...  Well, its been slightly over 2 years since that day...and just a month or so ago, i met up with Samantha once again. I had found her through a friend of mine. We chatted for a week or so, and then we agreed to meet up.   That mornin, i was dressed in my finest (well, finest meanin a quiksilver polo and jeans anyway...), and sittin in coffee bean sipping a huge cuppa (wat is it with their huge cups???). All of a sudden, my world suddenly went quiet, and my eyes suddenly affixed onto a WOOOOOOOAAAAAHHHHHHH young lady standin at the door for some reason...the next thing came as a real shocker...  "SHERWIN TAY!!! IS THAT U?"  Samantha???  Boy had she changed since the last time we met...she had gone from the sweet, innocent, little girl-next-door, to an intelligent, witty looker...she had matured a LOT (same cant b said for me though). Still, though we just barely managed to recognise each other after so long...we chatted like old pals, picking up where we left off..and catching up on years of stories...  My point is? No matter how much time u spend apart from a friend, or no matter how little contact u make with the person, as long as the friendship is true...itll last forever
