I also finished writing a bit more of my story.  Oh and I finished my personal statment for university, I'm hoping to get into Lancaster and study geography, then after that I want a job in conservation, maybe move to Canada. The woman from archery phoned me today telling me when we start, 3rd September, so im looking foward to that. Also my cousins havings a christening for her baby on 3rd October, I cant go tho cos thats the day I go to see an Avril concert in Manchester, can't fucking wait for that!!! :)
