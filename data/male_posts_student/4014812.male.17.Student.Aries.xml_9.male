So we were up and about and listening to the Punisher soundtrack until his grandma came around to pick him up.  After he left me and Ashley made plans to go to Steph's house and watch movies... So we did that.  There was like 5 people there... more were suppose to come... but they didnt but whatever.. it was all good cuz it would of been really really really really cramped in Steph's room cuz its so small.  Anyway i went over to Stephs around like 6 and didnt leave until like 10:02... watched Not Another Teen Movie... it was quite odd... but again it was funny lol.  Anyway... ima go play my Wrestling game cuz it has to go back tomorrow :(.
