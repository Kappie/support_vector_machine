Although all the old comments are *kaput,* I encourage you to please comment because it lets me know what you think of what I'm writing! I don't  usually   talk to myself.  Well, maybe every once in a while.  As of right now, the fast's doing well. I'm not hungry yet, but I'm sure I'll feel crappish around lunch, which, with me being the creature of habit that I am, has become the central gear in my day's revolution.   Quote of the Day   Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself, (I am large, I contain multitudes.)  (Walt Whitman)
