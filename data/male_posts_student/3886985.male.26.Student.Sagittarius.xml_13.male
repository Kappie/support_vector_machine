First, this can be fun because of the timing - I'm taking this just before the 2004 Presidential and Congressional elections. Second, the teacher is pretty cool and funny. Professor Galderisi is a Jewish Democrat from New York; he loves to make fun of the Democrats, and relates a lot of the course lessons to what has happened in previous elections.  Oh yeah, there are a few hotties in class, too. :)
