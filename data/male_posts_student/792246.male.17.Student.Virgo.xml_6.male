I've been playing FF4 on and off today, trying to get those fucking Imps to drop the fucking Imp summon. Fuck you Imps! Now I understand Garland's irrational fear. "I, Bun-Bun. will knock you all down!"  Ok, lets end the geeky references here for a second. Lizzy is a liar. She promised fun times today. She never came through. See if I get her the Congo. This only further proves that she is a lesbian.  So bored. If anyone has any idea at all on how to get me out of my house, please tell me right away.   Wow. Aren't I just the coooolest?
