What else...ah yes remember the clay guys that spilt the water? The same voices remake  urlLink Reloaded . Here's their  urlLink site ! So today, I got plenty of sleep and wasn't tired at all the whole day. I just made up a bunch of quizes and stuff because I was absent Thursday and Friday. Memorial Day was good, went to my cousins. Tomorrow I have to take the Italian speaking for the Regents, oh god I'm so screwed. My teacher is gonna make me piss my pants. But ah what the hell, 15 minutes of hell isn't that bad. That is all.
