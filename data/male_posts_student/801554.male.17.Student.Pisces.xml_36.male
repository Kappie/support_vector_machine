Had to work today, which is just dull, tomorrow I have to have fillings drilled in my teeth, which is just painful, on Wednesday I have an orthodontal appointment, which is just annoying, and next week I have to attend a sophomore retreat from 3:30 to 8:30, which is just oogles and oogles of fun!  Hopefully the week will pick up.  Actually it probably will. On Saturday Greg is coming over for a Python-athon, in celebration of the delivery of my DVDs. Much fun will be had.
