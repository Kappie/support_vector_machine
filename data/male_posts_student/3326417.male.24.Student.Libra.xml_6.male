For some time it has been absolutely driving me crazy the amount of time that I have had to deal with corporations and their mix ups, mistakes, and absolute unwillingness to return me my money. I myself work for a large corporation and carry out policies that subject my customers to the same run around.   Several times a week I have to call into a company, wait on hold, speak to someone I cannot understand, and hang up frustrated. Just recently I have had to deal with my insurances company and a medical billing company that both absolutely refuse to solve a situation that happened back in September.   Is this unethical? I question myself everyday when I go to work. While I won't go into specifics, I can assure that every angle is calculated. Where there is an opportunity to squeeze a dime from a customer, it is exploited.   There are organizations out there that do not subject their customers to this run around. Two that I can think of right away are Costco and Walmart. While they are not service based organizations, they are an immediate example of companies that would rather not argue and upset its customers. These organizations truly seek to please its most valuable component of business, its customers!  Is it possible for service organizations such as health care take this type of attitude? When I go to the doctors office would it be that far fetched to have someone greet me with a good afternoon or good morning? Could I solve my billing issues in one visit? I think the answer is yes! I think that health care organizations could benefit greatly from a customer oriented environment that seeks to absolutely please its customers.
