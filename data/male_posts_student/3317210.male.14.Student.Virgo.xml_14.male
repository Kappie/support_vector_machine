Everything must be a stepping stone to something else. Waste not on things which have no destination. You must push yourself, for if you do not push yourself, nothing will ever come out of you. You cannot rely on the world around you to do the pushing for you, because it will not happen. People who succeed in this life do so as they push themselves, or if they don't push themselves, they do something lots because they love the thing they do.  The main problem with my blog at the moment is that the ideas are so refined, I write, read, rewrite, everything I think. This should be a null issue now. Pure essence is what makes a character. In real life you don't have time to think a comment, rethink it, do it again, so why should you as you are writing? From now on I will cease to use the Preview button (as technologically cool it is) on all things, other than to check that link or image tags work.  I cannot slow down, or not keep pushing myself. Pushing myself will force me to do things I have not done before, which is good. One thing which I did stop writing for then, is for a moth. A moth landed on my computer screen, I think they're attracted by the static electricity on it, or merely the bright light, but I'm not sure. It had the most magnificent texture on it, and was brown, the colour of sandpaper, and was translucent in a fuzzy kind of way. As he was inside, and they don't survive very long, I softly got him in my hands, made a protective sphere, and released him outside through the dog door.  Always have time in your life for creatures that need help, even if it's a spider, snake, or anything.  I'll also mention my tadpoles at the moment. I saved them in December I think. Their eggs were put in a dam after heavy rain. Problem is, the dam is a quick drain dam, and all the water in there is gone after a few weeks. I found out they were up there, and knew they were going to die without my help. I went and got a bucket and began sorting the water. Spiders, some weird kinds of leeches, and weird insects which looked like leaves annoyed me, but I kept going. Today, I have saved countless lives of tiny tadpoles, and as small as that may seem, it is significant to me, and I'm sure that in the far future it will make some difference. Just remember, if you save one thing, you are therefore saving all it's descendants, so in the act of saving one tadpole, you may have just saved hundreds, if not thousands of frogs. And if the act of even saving ONE life is not significant, I ask you then, what is?   Every moment  Every moment you should be giving your hundred percent all. Everything you have is sitting there waiting to be used, and even if every limb you have is broken, you should still be thinking all the time. Trying to sort the world into logic, trying to observe everything you see.  Pick up a leaf and see everything there is to see. Notice the bumps? The veins? The translucency (that's light getting through the object, like transparency (like glass) but you can't nessacarily see straight through, if you know what I mean), the colours. Everything! Everything in this world is infinitely complex. Your body changes every atom it is made of in 8 years. The simplest thing still has a myriad of rules about it. Nothing is too small to be observed.  Everything observed is easy from someone else's point of view. You never know how complex a job is until you do it yourself.   Everything has an essence  A picture is just an array of colours, and hues if it contains no essence. Essence is what separates a picture from an illustration. An illustrator is from the Latin verb "lustrare", which literally means to illuminate.  urlLink This site  has influenced me in such a strange way. Look at it, respect the artwork, respect the brother who has passed to the other side. An illustrator, literally illuminates a person, gives them an amazing idea, redefines a thought, something of great meaning. To be an illustrator can relate to any part of your life, not just art.   Relaxing to some degree  Okay, I have to smile at least once as I write this =) Remember, that without other people, your development as a person, as an artist, cannot grow. I'd like to end this weird section and go into creativity by saying, enjoy everything you do, or try to find some way to do it. Even the worst task can be a competition of how fast you can get it done! Also,  ask yourself, "ARE YOU SERIOUS!" Of which, I shall always reply, "YES!"     Creativity  Ok, straight from talking about being spontaneous and quick thinking to doing it.  Veins. Hands. Blood rushing back and forth. Life. Essence. Birth of the world. Everyone must come from somewhere, everyone must have a story before themselves. Everything has an origin, of which it is almost always complex and confusing. Respect it for it.  Must try to find an aim. Instead of shooting bullets wildly into the night, try to find a target and aim not to shoot blanks.  Wait, before even that I have to find out what exactly I want out of creativity. New ideas? Strong characters? Realistic plot? WHAT?  Dictionary.com, Creativity - Characterized by originality and expressiveness; imaginative: creative writing. This essentially means creating anything. Including a short story, which I may as well do now.   Aerial Spire  The world as we know it, is no more. Recreate the world, remold it. The human race has not had a massacre, and had to rebuild itself, merely that the world has never had to go along that certain path. High above the ground, hidden within the deepest breaches of the clouds, are great aerial fortresses. Helium is the life force, keeping their world afloat, while hydrogen, created by splitting the water of the clouds, is their movement. Some people live in a settlements of thousands of people, the metropolis's of the skies. They are similar to countries. They all have their own way of subsistence. Their own economies, and their own rulers. Then, there are two kinds of free-rangers. First, is the traders, who usually move in small groups of vessels, from metropolis to metropolis, and survive through trading. Then there is the rogues. People who live by pillaging others. They commonly target the small traders, but some have vessels large enough to take on, and often beat the metropolises.  Well, that's good babble. Not really going anywhere though. I wonder how you develop such an idea... Only probably by practice. Exams are good for that, they force you to work in a small timeframe and give a reasonable result out of it. The computer may actually be working against you, as it gives you a world of options on what to do, yet when you're in an exam, with a pen, some paper, and only 45 minutes remaining on the clock, you cannot spare to waste anything.  The airship began it's slow crawl across the sky, leaving a tiny vapor trail in it's wake. In the cockpit of the vessel, sat an old man, with a cane across his lap. On the top of the old man's cane, engraved into the wood, was a sculpture of an eagle, with two gems for it's eyes. He was staring out into the calm blue sky, wandering what it would be like. Whether it was still the way it had used to be. The silence was broken, by the energetic sound of someone running up the spiral stairs from the lower hold behind him.  "Grandpa, where's our next stop?" He turned slowly in his chair, and looked through his spectacles to his grandson. The boy was growing to be more like his father every day. "You have heard of the haven of Hallows Peak before, haven't you?" "Hallows Peak? Are you serious? Wasn't that where the Kailen Wars took place?" "Yes it was. Just remember that a war doesn't just involve guns and explosions, but people too." "What're we going there for then? They have the best of everything don't they?" "They  used  to have the best of everything, remember the hydrogen cells we've been making? I have an old friend there who makes them. He'd be very interested in our new design." "Tell me about Hallows Peak grandpa, you've been there before haven't you?" "Not just been there, I used to live there. That was where I met your grandmother." "Was dad born there?" "No, your father was born on this very vessel. We left Hallows Peak almost fifty years ago now." "But why'd you leave Hallows Peak! It's part of legends! It's, it's, it's..." "It's the tallest mountain on all of Earth, and the only habitable bit of land left on this world..." "Why'd you leave then?" "The war came." "Yeah, and?" "The war took your mother, your father, and my wife. You were the only one left..." They both stared out the windshield, into the clouds, where, if one had the eyes of a hawk, one would have seen a glittering peak, covered in a permafrost that has been there since the dawn of time. Neither of them were really paying too much attention to the sky though, mainly to how to avoid the next step of logical conversation. Breaking the silence had a feeling similar to that of dropping a glass vase. "How long until we get there?" the young boy muttered silently under his breath. "About half an hour. How about you go and get the cell ready?" "No problem," The boy ran down the spiral stairs, and the sound began to fade away.  The haven of Hallows Peak is believed to be the last bit of habitable land for humans. It is the center of the civilised world, and is real estate which only the richest can afford. Being the only bit of land left in the world, it has commonly come under attack, the worst of which being the Kailen Wars. Half the peak was ripped off of it's foundings, and plunged to doom, by a cruiser's suicidal attack.  (first sentence, wake is used in boats, slipstream in aeroplanes, but I'll use wake still, as the airship is slow, more like a boat than a plane) {second, [Middle English halwen, from Old English hlgian. See kailo- in Indo-European Roots.], Hallows Peak, to Kailen Wars) (third, possibly add in a necropolis to the mix, a floating city that had been wiped out by a threat [dragons burning all the city?] but it mysteriously floats. It is said to be cursed, and no-one has gone there since, or at least none have returned to tell of the story)  I'd love to continue the story, but it's time for me to "go to bed"... In other words, that means pretend to be asleep, but more essentially go to my room and do my homework. I really love this world so far. I really really do =)  This post has been amazingly successful, and it actually takes me a while to scroll down through all the babble! Farewell, and may we meet again at the haven of Hallows Peak.
