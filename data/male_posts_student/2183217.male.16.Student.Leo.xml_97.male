She thought it would be another wonderful day , we were all joking around and she was laying on my floor unsuspecting the bad tragedy that would soon happen. The uninvited beached whale perched herself on my bed in a standing position, and before any of us could do anything, that fat mean girl named Sally pounced on Lindz like two heffers over the last peace of greasy chicken. She nearly squeezed the life out of her, releasing the first and only time I ever heard Lindz scream like a girl. Knowing that something must be terribly wrong for this to happen , we all piled on top of stupid sally in a scandalous dog pile only to get kicked punched pinched and bit by the devistated and half alive... Lindz. R.I.P LINDZ , I hope you're eating chicken nuggets in heaven.
