But I'm so not spring time fresh right now that I could probably roll around in the grass and kill the whole frickin' yard.  I would be afraid to go to the field behind my house for fear that my neighbors cows will start licking me because they've mistaken me for a salt lick.   Argh.  I want to be COLD.
