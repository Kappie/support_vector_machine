I have an intense bet with my buddy Damion over the Leafs/Bruins and who comes out on top for the season.  Todd, keep us posted, if I had more time I would gear up!  By the by, we got a new dog, trial period, see if it mellows out Pete to have a friend, but we don't have a name, I wanted Zeke, but Pete and Zeke sounds too similar apparently to the wife.  So I tried for Deke, but Heather didn't get it, but the dog spends his day faking and juking Pete and running past him, so I thought it was appropriate.  I think we are settling on Sampras, Heather will call him Sam, I will use the full name, so I can yell out of my house "Pete, Sampras!" every morning.  One last note, Mike, give us a post on your change of life plans, how is your talk with the counselor's and school going?  Any decisions?
