Then went back to sleep till about 12:30  Then I went on a dog walk in the baking sun, nearly getting run over by a manure spreader in the process, then sort of nearly went back to sleep again.  Walked to badminton, managing to loose all feeling in my ass and legs crawling under some barbed wire and through a patch of thistles. Then nearly killed myself playing badminton in the bloody heat.  So I have the rest of tonight and tomorrow morning to completely learn my French presentation, and as many questions from the convo booklet as is humanly possible. Ahhh crap. I might as well just do the 'yoghurt in my eyes' thing and live with a crap speaking grade.  Woohoo.
