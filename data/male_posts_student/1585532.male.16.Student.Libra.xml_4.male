I'm not really sure about how I'm going to keep schedules, but it will work out eventually.  Anyways the last day of school was fun!  I ripped up my math final and went online...but I accidently showed my friends "Robb and Elissa's Cedar Point Trip."  That was not the best idea.....And Amy, thats a scary as hell picture of Robb!  What did people do to deserve to see that!?  Anyways, I'm gonna go do some stuff...get ready to go to SeaWorld, which is going to be um....interesting.  Anyways, later!
