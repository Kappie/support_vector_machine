Yesterday, an Oxford-Cambridge event was held at Sunway College. I got to chaperone Mark disney, the editor of Education Quarterly. Cool! He's a really nice and fun guy, and his talks were really interesting. He talked about the art of writing, got some tips from his talk. i need help with my writing.  After that, I had a lousy lunch of nasi lemak, and then proceeded to the MPH(multi purpose hall) to set up the things. I was the DJ(kind of) for the day. The songs were actually preselected by a staff member, of course. I practiced with her before. There were a few glitches, ut luckily they were very small, nothing big. Not many people noticed them, methinks.  All in all, it was a pretty interesting day. One of my regrets was that I didn't get to mix around with the students. I'd love to get to know some students(wink,wink). The last time a similar event was held I was a student leaader and got to lead a school. this time around I was the "DJ", so I did not lead any schools around. Well, there are two sides to every coin.
