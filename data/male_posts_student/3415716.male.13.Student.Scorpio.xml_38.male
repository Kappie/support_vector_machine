Anyway,  New Orleans  was an awesome city. The only I didn't like was trash day because it made the city stink horribly. The zoo was the best one I have ever been to. It actually had interesting things to see unlike some other zoos (the  Santa Barbara Zoo  for example). My favorite day included three very important things: going to the zoo, seeing Harry Potter on an Imax screen and seeing the  Mississippi River  for the first time.  Holy crap it's huge!  No matter what you read the Mississippi looks bigger when you see it in real life. I was shocked because just the part within my eye sight was bigger then most lakes I have seen(I'm working on getting a picture). It was annoying that so many people acted like it was  Mardi Gras  every day there.  Typical dumb American Tourist .   Tomorrow, Part II describes my adventures at USM and what happens when everyone on your hall breaks camp rules at 12:00 pm on the last night.
