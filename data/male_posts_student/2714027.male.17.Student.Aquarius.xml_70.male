We parked up in the city centre and then had a walk around the main shopping area. I was dragged into a whole set of designer shops including Heal's - a furniture and home store with seriously expensive goods - plus Harvey Nichols - a department store where the prices for clothes reach into four figures. You go into H.N., flanked by clean cut, well groomed shop assistants and you feel so out of place amongst the expensive clothes, like you're not stylish enough. Still, it's just a shop I guess.  We went around the dock and canal area, which was so striking and full of contrasting elements. There were so many great photo oppurtunities, just taunting my lack of a camera, so I purchased a book about digital photography whilst in Waterstones later. I've just today found out that the camera I'm thinking of buying will be out on Wednesday, so I might pick it up next week.  Today we ventured off to Nottingham University's open day, which took ages to find due to a huge lack of signs around the city. Once we got there though, it was mighty impressive, from the beautiful parkland setting to the department itself. The computer secience department is actually at a separate campus, but what a campus! All of the buildings are only five years old, clad in wood and glass like some Swedish-styled Ikea playground. The infrastucture is top notch as well, with tons of new PCs all with flat screens, wireless networking and crazily fast internet. What's more though, is the way that the courses have been arranged. You can spend your whole second year in Malaysia at a campus there, plus take a year out in industry.  Slightly less exciting is the accomodation, which all seemed modern and well looked after. The catered halls near the computer science building were all en suite and suitably modern, with the self catering flats nearby as well. I didn't get to see the Union or talk to any current students, but what I did see was very impressive. The remaining universities have got some way to go to outdo Nottingham, that's for sure.
