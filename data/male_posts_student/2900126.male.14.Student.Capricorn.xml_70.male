My friends went to the movies and I missed them, they saw "The Village" again and sneaked into "Thunderbirds" which I really wanted to see, and I could've avoided getting my phone taken away if I made there in time to go with them, because my grams would've never found out that my bike wasn't here if I wasn't here.      ~ LinZ is in NY now I have to get her and some other people souveniers from Florida when I go on Sunday.  *we're just gunna have to see what the future holds for me and my social life. This is exactly why I hate my family because they're stubborn whores, every single one of them. I think it's a family trait. but anyway I'll try to cool off.
