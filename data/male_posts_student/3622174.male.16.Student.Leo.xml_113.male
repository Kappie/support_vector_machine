We'll look at two auctions from the category of Totally Bizarre, one from Really Weird, and one from DVD/Movies.  So, let's get straight to it.  Here's your eBay Hunter goodness for the day:   Human Skull. Medical Specimen. Perfect. 32 Teeth.  Category: Totally Bizarre Link:  urlLink Click here.   Holy crap.  This guy is auctioning an actual human skull.  Could it be fake?  Very possibly.  Should he really charge over $300 for something that is probably fake? Probably not.  This auction could be considered illegal, because he's auctioning parts of the human body.  eBay stopped this auction once, and this time, warns them not to, because it follows the eBay guidelines.     Six Great Presidential Dollar Bills  Category: Totally Bizarre Link:  urlLink Click it.   Oh god.  I smell fakeness.  Is there a such thing as a $2,001 bill?  I don't think so.  For two dollars, you can get a presidential dollar bill with..well, a president on it.  The newest ones are the Ronald Reagan one, and George W., of course.  The Reagan and Bush ones are in color, and the back of the Bush one is all about September 11th, with color images of the Twin Towers, of the NY FD, PD, and EMS, and a picture of the Pentagon.    These are definitely the kind of auction that only political fans would be interested in, because it has their favorite presidents, on a fake dollar bill.  My advice: skip this one.  I don't even know why I mentioned it.   Unsearched Barrels of Uncut Sapphire  Category: Really Weird Link:  urlLink  Click Here   Liar!  This can't be true.  That sapphire looks like the exact same thing my sister got when she went on a "shopping spree" in the Bahamas and got a sapphire as a free gift.  This one is definitely the biggest fake I have covered thus far in my entire eBay Hunter career.  Don't fall for this one.  This person claims to have barrels of them just lying around in her family's underground mine, or something, and also has other stones of great value.  They're either counterfeit, or someone enjoyed the Bahamas shopping spree for several days.   Spiderman 2 Auctions!!!  Category: DVD  Movies Link:  urlLink Click it.   Holy freakin' crap.  They are auctioning off limited edition posters, props from the movie, and all sorts of other Spiderman 2 stuff.  I'm not going to participate, because I don't have a credit card and my parents won't let me bid on things.  So, oh well.  But, some of the stuff they have here is great.  The prices of the posters are absolutely insane (almost $300 for one of them), and I didn't look at props, but, if the posters were that high, then I can't imagine what the props are.  And, this is Sony's auctions, too, so it's definitely something to check out if you're like me, being a huge Spiderman fan.   ----------------  That's it for eBay Hunter today.  I'm getting ready to begin today's Digital Lust updates, because I'm running behind and would like to get them done early today.  Check back here tonight for some new stuff, like Late Night Bloggin Vol VI, and other things I'll post, probably.  See ya next time.
