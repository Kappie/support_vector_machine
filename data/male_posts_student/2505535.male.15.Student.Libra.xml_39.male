Then we went back to Rachel's for a cup of tea and then back to mine where Helen and Alex joined us, we watched the last ever Friends and Big "evil" Brother.  Today after music lessons and stuff and so on, I'm going to Fantomas with; Dave, Jon, Laura, Paul, Matt, Brooke and Ollie (I'm sure I've mentioned this list of names before, but you're getting it again) That should be most cool - I'll let you know how that goes.
