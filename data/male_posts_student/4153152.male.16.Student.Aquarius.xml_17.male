Right now, we have 3 scenes blocked out and some maps and music. So far we'll be using:  Maps    DC Urban Siege  Basra  Operation Bragg   Music    Hector's Death (Troy Soundtrack)  Backseat Driver (007: Tomorrow Never Dies Soundtrack)  All Along the Watchtower (Jimi Hendrix)  So far, it's coming along very well, and I hope to have all the filming and post-production done by August. I don't want to give away details, so I won't be saying much. However, I can say that it will be similar in ways to the  urlLink Navy SEALs  movie done by the (I assume) British DC Resource. It's a pretty whopping movie. It's excellent though.  I'm going to go scope out the maps a little more. I may be back later in the evening.
