One particular anti-google organization, aptly named  urlLink Google-Watch , is closely monitoring the actions that Google takes to try and make points against it. They've already whinily bitched about Google's very useful PageRank system, which will be implemented into the Gmail service. They say that PageRank is useless inside Gmail's system, and they also try to prove how intrusive it is.  People, this is an automated service. Noone's going to directly look into your emails and send information or ads through your mail. This is just a computer trying to give you possibly helpful info based on the simple text of your messages. It scans the email once, retrieves links associated to your mail, and throws the information it retrieved in the scan away.  There's nothing to be scared of.  There's also the politicians aiming their bureaoucratical cannons at Gmail, complaining about the same issues. But they also    say that the scan is more intrusive than Google seems to say it is, whereas, it's almost the same exact premise as the virus-scanning doohickeys that  urlLink Yahoo!  and  urlLink Hotmail  use. It's just used for a different purpose.  There really shouldn't be a reason to complain about such a promising product, especially since there will forever be other free email services to use out there as an alternative. If you don't like the deal Google offers you, then don't take it. Keep your Yahoomail. When the doors to Gmail open to the public, if ever, more people than the protesters think will be chomping at the bit to get ahold of their own accounts.
