Thank you for having badass taste in music. Thank you for notbeing afraid to tell me what you really think. I really do appreciate it, and as I've said before, there's only two girls right now that I really give a damn about. Thanks Blair, for always being yourself, and letting nobody change you. You kick ass. And you're not that bad looking either. ;-)
