It's no longer drawing power from the power adapter (tested against other power adapters known to be functional), so I'm gonna have to send it in to Apple.  I imagine it'll cost a little bit, being out of warranty, now.  I think I'll get the feet on it replaced, also, since all mine fell off quite a time ago.  Until then, I'm scavenging machines at work to work on, and I might work on my old TiBook, but only if I think it's worth the hassle.  And right now, I don't think it really would be.  Thanks to OS X and my .Mac subscription, I've got all my contacts, calendars, and Safari bookmarks on this machine already.  If I install backup on it, I'll really be set, get a lot more of my stuff.  Which reminds me, I should update my backup settings on my PB when I get it back/functional.  Maybe I should just do it know, there's still some juice left.  Maybe it won't even work considering I have some *cough cough* prerelease OS on it. *cough cough*  (Don't worry, it's legal, Apple sent it to me, woo!)  Anyway, blah, I miss my poor little powerbook G4 12", Rev A.  Pray for it!
