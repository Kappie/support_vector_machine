Just as the IDF offenses radicalize the Palestinian people, terrorist attacks and suicide bombings allow extremists in Israeli politics to thrive. Witness the Intifada’s ability to create support for Sharon’s. Moderates in both communites need to be empowered in order for there to be the possibility of peace. Even though many of Israel’s attempts to crush the Intifada are wrong and immoral, the ultimate defeat of such an offensive on innocent Israelis is a necessary prerequisite for peace. Without this ending, Isrealis fears will continue radicilize them.  One must find the middle path between the Israeli ultra-aggressiveness and your proposed relative-passivity that will empower both Palestinian and Israeli moderates.   Here's my response: Israel can put down radical violent opposition through a constructive security policy that engages with the more moderate elements in Palestinian society. The best way to stop terrorism is to marginalize the terrorists and make Palestinians want to stop terrorism themselves. Right now, Palestinians see no reason to stop terrorism. When there was a peace process, the Israelis kept on building settlements and harrasing Palestinians at checkpoints. Palestinians have no light at the end of the tunnel and so they support or - at the very least - don't try to stop desperate terrorism.  I'd also be interested to know how you found this blog. I'm looking for ways to publicize it, so if anyone (not just this anonymous poster) gets interested in this blog, please let me know how you came across it.
