Well, I'll occasionally be posting songs that I or my friend and "band"mate wrote, so without further ado:   Time Controls Our Lives      Moving too fast, it’s all a blur    All I can do is think of her    Hope it don’t last, how can this be?    High-speed life’s been tearing at me      Chorus:   It never stops running          The clock don’t stop turning          Like sand thru the hourglass          Seconds of my life have passed          Into nothingness, wasted away          I still don’t know what to say          Why does time have to control our lives?      Time slips by, I want to know why    Life’s too short for me to lie    I hate the clock, all of its strife    What do I wanna do with life?      Bridge:  Time wasted away          I can’t tell what to say          Life wasted with indecisiveness          Time making life a mess          Can’t decide what to do yet          But I don’t wanna have regrets…    And that's it.  Tell me what you think.  Did we suck, or did we  suck ?   I wish I was still in a band, but alas, Steve no longer shows any interest in pursuing the band and I haven't played my guitar in months.  If anybody lives near Craptown and is interested in starting a band with me, I'm up for ideas.
