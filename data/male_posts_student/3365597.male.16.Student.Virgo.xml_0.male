I don't know for sure if this trick is completely new, but I've never seen it before. We call it the jesus christ frontroll, and the idea kind of came from a windsurf magazine I was reading yesterday. In that magazine I saw Robby Naish doing a tabletop, with one hand, and they called it the jesus christ.  The jesus christ frontroll is kind of the same idea. You jump, the same way as you would with a normal frontroll, and then you do a raley, with the hand on the side in witch you are heading to spreaded out,and your other hand, still on the bar, but on the wrong side of it. (your righthand is now in the air, and your left hand is on the leftside of your bar.) To make this look good, you have to be totally horizontal, and your arms spreaded like you're jesus christ on his cross... After this, pull your legs in, and dive into a frontroll, and land it!  pictures and film of this jump will come soon! email me or rick if you wanna see it.
