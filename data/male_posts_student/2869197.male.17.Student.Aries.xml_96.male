Here is how you matched up against all the levels:      Level    Score       Purgatory   (Repenting Believers)   Very High       Level 1 - Limbo   (Virtuous Non-Believers)   Moderate       Level 2   (Lustful)   Low       Level 3   (Gluttonous)   Moderate       Level 4   (Prodigal and Avaricious)   Very Low       Level 5   (Wrathful and Gloomy)   Low       Level 6 - The City of Dis   (Heretics)   Very Low       Level 7   (Violent)   Low       Level 8- the Malebolge   (Fraudulent, Malicious, Panderers)   Low       Level 9 - Cocytus   (Treacherous)   Very Low       Take the  urlLink Dante's Inferno Test    Yeah...that sounds about right. It's normal to have about 3 major mental disorders right? Also, this is good for me. I don't believe in purgatory. Heehee.  My plans continue. I've scheduled a walk-about at the YMCA for 4:00 tomorrow. I still haven't worked on my resume. Well, I started, but then I got sucked into a 4 hour bout of  Fishy , a online flash game.  Fishy  is perhaps the most addicting thing that has ever happened to me. Quite fun.  Talked to Jillian today. First time I spoke to a definable "school" person all summer (excluded my girlfriend, of course). Always a pleasure.
