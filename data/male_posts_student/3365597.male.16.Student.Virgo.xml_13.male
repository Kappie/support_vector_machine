( you can only do this if there is wind above 7 bft ) take a kite... no kitesurfing size! just about 4 mÂ². take the kite. forget about the lines just connect it straight on to the bar and see... your adventure can get started! today we go to that adventure and I can tell you.. we will go back to it!! just TOO much fun we had with it! the kite.. serious just get crazy.. it starts to fly on its own.. no steering.. no control.. no stopping.. no nothing on in.. it's made to go wrong! but wonderly it didn't go wrong with us today, we both sur5 the trip:) we did some jumps with it.. guess how high... about 30 CM!!!!!! totaly crazy!! the next time there is such hard wind we will try something new: sidewalk kiting with a skateboard... KAMIKAZI!!!  DETAIL:  rick's dad on the phone:   dad: you won't kite today right? rick: no offcourse not(a) dad: you promise that? rick: sure dad...  dad hangs up the telephone.. one, two, kite is up!:D  end of the day:  dad: I'm proud of you, boy!  rick: I'm proud aswell!
