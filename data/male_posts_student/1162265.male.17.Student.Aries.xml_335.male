I've wanted to see the movie, but I had no desire to go with my parents to see it.  Fortunately, my parents loved it enough to buy a DVD copy of it.  Apparently the movie was so controversial when it came out in the 1970's that the Fed's supposedly 'removed' most of the copies.  The only way to get it until recently was from bad bootlegs of it.  Fortunately, it was found in some Hollywood vault recently and digitally remastered and all that jazz.  I really have to say, for any revolutionary thinking person, this movie is really heavy.  It starts off with a Senator wanting to get elected president, but he'll lose by a narrow margin unless he gets the black vote.  So he decides to prove himself pro-negro by integrating the CIA.  Long story short one guy becomes a key agent in the CIA, but quits.   He uses his training from the CIA to train street gangs to fight a Guerilla war against the United States.  Coming from an anarchist perspective, I almost cried.  The director of the movie clearly researched things well when he made the movie, and explained sooo many things about guerilla warfare.  For example, this one guy is testing distances and the former CIA guy tells him "Street Lamps are placed 30 feet apart, use that as a reference point for distance."    The movie also had a strong message about race.  The whites in the movie were all clearly evil, and even some of the blacks, it's not really like that in real life.  But besides that, the main character stresses it's "not about hating whitey, but loving freedom."   Oh, and to top it all off one of the quotes from the Dead Prez Album "Let's Get Free" comes from that.   After being told he and the other light-skinned gang members are to rob a bank]  Pretty Willie: All the yellow nigga's, right?  [His anger coming to a slow boil]  Pretty Willie: Man, I am TIRED of that! I am not passing! I am BLACK! Do you hear me, man? I am BLACK! I am a NIGGA', you understand me? I was BORN Black, I -LIVE- Black, and I'm gonna die, prob'ly -BECAUSE- I'm Black, because some Cracker who -KNOWS- I'm Black, better than -YOU-, Nigga', is prob'ly gonna put a BULLET in the back of my head!     Okay now real business.  I'm not talking about work, it's fine nothing really to say.  In two hours, we're getting into the car and driving up to Cape Cod, and then taking a ferry to Martha's Vineyard.  I haven't really decided what I personally am going to do there.  We're there all weekend, till monday, so we'll be there during the highest volume of the year.  Beautiful.  La illa la-llah  Speaking of skin color, based on the previous quote (I'll start talking about work)., I thought it was funny how Carmen (the art director) was mad at us for almost letting a kid get sunburn.  Haha, I realized at that point that sunburn was really a foreign concept to me, since I usually use (lighter) people to gauge when I need to get out of the sun.  But ewwww... yet again I wish I was darker, because my skin doesn't tan nicely, it gets darker but it also brings out my red undertone and just looks strange.  A moment it'd be good to be haitian or some other black groups that is known for being dark, would be now.    Oh, and I tied a bandana around my head randomly, and Nia said I look Mexican.  Hahaha.
