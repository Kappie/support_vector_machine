I woke up at Tim's house after a productive night of studying. I got to school for my 9:00 Comp Sci exam, and did pretty well. Afterwards, I hung out with a slightly grumpy Martha while she finished her AP Art exam, but she relaxed after a while. We had a pleasant lunch at Dean and Deluca, and then cuddled up for the 12:30  Return of the King . She's convinced that we broke the world record for holding hands. She gave me two awesome Christmas presents: a Sonic-blue X-Box controller ^_^ and an Old Navy fleece that looks  really  good on me. Thanks again, Martha! I really need to find her something for tomorrow... Well anyways after that I took her back to the hotel and got a kiss ^_^   After that was Emilie's birthday party at an undisclosed location (you'll see why in a sec). We had a really good time, and the food was awesome. She gave me a System of a Down CD that I'm currently listening to. We left the restaurant.... and then the day did a total 180. As Tim was heading to his car, I extended my hand for a friendly handshake... and then promptly slapped him in the face. Heh. He chased me like the ninja he is back to my car. I hopped in and cranked the engine. Totally distracted by my current mental high, Tim and Katy thumping my window, and  Fly Like An Eagle  playing on the radio.   I backed out, cautiously I might add, but not cautiously enough. Some prick was parked like 5 feet from the little concrete thingy that you're not supposed to roll your wheels over in a parking space, with his tail hanging out into the middle of the road. POW!. There goes my fucking right tail light. Despite the probably wise council of Emilie's parents, and because my blood was boiling and Tim and Katy advised me otherwise, I didn't leave my license or number. I guess I would have had the damage been serious in any way. Ask me in real life if you want the full report. I'm a teenager from a family of musicians, I can't afford to pay for this type of stuff, and tonight I refused to because the guy was incorrectly parked. My parents say that I'm the more guilty party, but I don't care. So many factors kept me from being a level headed driver at that moment in time, and I personally have been hit-and-run twice at school (causing much worse damage, by people that have shitloads of money). Whatever, I hope this thing doesn't mushroom into a world of consequences, but that could very well happen.   Life sure is a roller coaster ride isn't it?
