And this girl in my Japanese class was writing in a journal with Death's beautiful image plastered in about 46 different locations. Speaking of that class, its time for the adorable freshman stalking update.  I am now officially stating that my attraction to him is sexual. There! I admitted it! Yea, but hes emulating me and stealing my personality, which is flattering and ironic, since I stole all my personality from other people. We spent about 2 minutes make grotesque faces at each other, and it was beautiful and I felt like making love to him that very second. But yes, I am now officially a pedophile. You may all hate me now. Please send me hate mail, but nice ones please.   Oh joy, the Eric thinks he's a pedophile stage! Goodie! I don't think I knew at this point that Bret was a "celebrity", which makes the whole thing funnier somehow. The girl writing in the Death journal turned out to be Sophie, who eventually made it onto the aforementioned links section. This links section is ironically enough not there since the latest update of this site, as I am a lazy whore who didn't ever update it in the first place. So why bother?
