Meat is good. Booze is good. Parents that don't mind you drinking are good.  Met some new people. There was... ummm... Emily, Becky... met Sara again... this bloke called Carl, another Jason (who I confused the hell out of) and this Tottenham supporter/twat called... um... I can't remember. There was also a few other people, but I can't remember their names. Oh... there was Jason's ex-girlfriend, Charlotte, who apparently is the very definition of used goods. And her latest boyfriend, who looks like he should be in a crappy punk band.  Anyhoo, food is good.  Oobs.
