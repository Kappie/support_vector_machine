XD  Ervin, Kyle, and I just got back from shooting bottle rockets into the sky and at each other and stuff for like 2 hours.  It was GREAT fun!  Now I'm exhausted however...  Stupid Steve and Glenny just sat on the hill and watched because they were too big of pansy ass bitches to play with the explosives.  Hm...I need to talk to "someone".  This seriously isn't healthy man.  We need an intervention.  I think I'm gonna go to bed now....I'm pretty sleep from all the energy I just used.  Peace Out and talk to you guyses later!
