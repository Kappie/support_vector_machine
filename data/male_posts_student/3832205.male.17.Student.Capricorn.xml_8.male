I still feel my half of it, but the other was left behind somewhere. Sometimes I wish I didnt have feelings, then I wouldnt feel hurt or alone, but I guess it was my own mistakes. The other half wouldnt be gone if I wasnt such a dumbass. What am I thinking, yeah theres so much I want to say, but I better shut up befor I make things even worse.
