Do you know what that means...It means that there is only one question left to ask: "WHAT WILL THE WORLD LOOK LIKE THE DAY AFTER TOMMORROW?"  Wha ha ha.  Yeah that movie was okay but not that great if you catch my drift and if you did not than you are a bad catch.  Something else on the news Candidate Kerry came riding through Cincinnati today.  Yeah.  I was surprised.  I was driving down the parade rode soon before the festive event and I noted that the sidewalks were littered with hippies and all manner of tydye.  I saw a dog with a tube top on.  The last thing that I wish I could forget was a man dressed in a flesh body suit and in drag.  Yeah you guessed it the bikini.  AARRGGH.  His face was covered with all manner of alarming make up and aaach i cannot stand to write any more.  I am not Homophobic and i do not intend to sound so but what i witnessed yesterday was horrid.  Thanks Kerry.  We owe you another one.
