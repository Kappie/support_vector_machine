When we arrived at there, the professional gears frightened us. THough it's we, who take the photos, not the gear.  The flowers are beautiful. No one can resist their them. I took some shots of them, however, none looks cool.  The one which impressed me the most is the one i took leaving the greenhouse. It was a photo of a waterfall. I can't even imagine how could it be their, the CBD of Hong Kong.  Next time, before I take some shots of Lotus, I should improve my skills. 'coz Lotus is just like a mystery, it's difficult to present its beauty in a photo, but once you can did it, there's nothing that you can't express through the camera.
