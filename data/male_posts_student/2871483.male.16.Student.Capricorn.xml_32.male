So, I got a ton of snacks and Mountain Dew and watched the El Mariachi series again.  Those movies are so great.    I'm pretty much over it, and I figure I'll swear off of girls for a little while, no sense in jumping in again.  -  In retalliation to what someone said in their blog...  FUCK YOU!  I DID NOT COPY YOU!  -  In other news...there is something I haven't said before in public, but here it goes.  Flibby jangly wonk wonk.  Thank you.
