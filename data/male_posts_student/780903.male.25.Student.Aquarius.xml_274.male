"Students - Prof. XXXXX will be inviting 2 students to join him... for another lunch after the brown-bag lunch on Friday... If more than 2 students are interested, a lottery will be held. Thanks."  It makes perfect sense, I guess, for the professor to be having lunch with the speaker after the talk.  But it just sounds funny to say "another lunch."
