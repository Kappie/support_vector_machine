If only i knew the situation i was in, if only i would of known that she really liked me a lot. But then when i really started to like her...i was too late. Now i have sought and fought for that love for a long time...if only i could change the past...but i cant, all i can do is let fate take its course and let her c again whats in front of her. Her heart and mind battle, mind did that aswell. I always wanted my heart to win but it couldnt face the reality of the mind, so inorder to make them agree...you must make them both face reality, but it is ur and my decision. As I cry and wonder...i think this can end in a better way, it may not b the way u want, but i think it will end in a better way...as the world turns   urlLink Someday
