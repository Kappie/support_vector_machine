That's all that I'm doing tonight, since I'm too tired to post anything else.  So, let's get right to it:   тнє єиD оf тнє тімє  Link:  urlLink тнє єиD оf тнє тімє   Heh, this one is funny because I can't understand it.  Everything about it is strange, sometimes, the posts aren't even in English, but, most of them are... this is the dumbest blog I have looked at so far... and that's all I want to say about it.   Soy in Tokyo  Link:  urlLink Click it   Here's another Japan-based blog... this one is written by a girl who is living with a Japanese family over the summer for 2 months, and some of the posts are actually interesting.  She talks about the people that are in Tokyo, and what they are like, and gives a better insight to what life is really like in that country.  This is one of the better blogs that I have looked at since I started this little event, and its one that should definitely be checked out.  Sorry for the lack of update today... I've been so bored that I can't even think about anything to post about.  In fact, even posts that I did make (like this one) were incredibly short, and I do hope to change that tomorrow by making more posts.  So, look for more of me tomorrow, hopefully I'll be in a little better of a mood, and things can go back to normal.  Until next time, go to sleep.  That's where I'm heading.
