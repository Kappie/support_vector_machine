It's empty because of graduation, of course, another class of 18 year olds sent out into the open air like termites to chomp at the wood of the world.  I wish I could tell them so much, but even I can't put everything into words.  I want to hug them, slap them, beat them with a large hunk of wood, give them meaningful advice, tell them there is a God and yes he does love you, I want to kiss them on their foreheads in a solemn benediction and tell them that yes, as human beings, you are going to fail.
