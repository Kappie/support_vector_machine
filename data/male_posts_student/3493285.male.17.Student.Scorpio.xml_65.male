(think long and hard about this one..who even knew what figure skating was about until the harding-kerrigan scandal?)   sometimes i feel like my life is reality tv! tomorow it will be! maybe i might post some pictures. but then again maybe not, i guess you'll have to wait and see what the reality is! HAHAHA i am so funny sometimes.  i'm going to go eat captain crunch and watch full house. it's like i'm 7 again!
