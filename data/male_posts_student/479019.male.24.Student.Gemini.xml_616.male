I should have went to sleep earlier, but I was engaged in a discussion on human sexuality.  I'll probably try to make it to the Belmar tonight. I haven't been there in a while.  I hate it when the reserve library doesn't have books I need right away. I need to budget my time really well this year. 16 units plus research papers.  Tomorrow I need to pay Walmart a visit.  I need groceries as well as a towel.  **
