It used to be Arnold saying, "Good Morning. How are you? First I would just like to get to know you.... Who is your daddy and what does he do?" Now it's Mr. T saying, "Whatcha talkin about foo, quit your jibba jabba... you talk or you hurt!" For all of you who have my cell number, feel free to call me just to listen to it!  ***
