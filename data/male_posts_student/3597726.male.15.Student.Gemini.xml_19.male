So the only people that were there to practice were just Thomas and I. So, yeah, we went through events 1-3 like a million times before going downstairs to munch on donuts.   I spent the rest of my beofore-evening time painting a sign for vbs with Becca (Shaw). At like 2 o'clock we finaly got home. My dad told me to mow, so I clipped a tree real badly and almost crashed the garage door.   But now I have to go to the Church again to help put up the signs. Catch ya'll later...
