I'm a little disappointed that it's not the best album as I've ever heard, but it's still good. "Mexico," "Between the Dim  the Dark," "Young America"  "Daylight" are amazing songs. Get them from  urlLink iTunes  if you can. It's not that the rest of the songs suck. They're just average. I'm sure they'll grow on me.  I also recommend downloading the demo version of " urlLink Daylight " (Don't worry, this one's free). The difference between the demo and the final product are startling. You will be amazed.  Word.
