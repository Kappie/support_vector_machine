Congradulations to everyone who didnt sink, and don't worry Mikey the sight of you toppling into the water was probely worth you getting one C in the class. A hardy thanks to everyone in that class for getting out of 2/3 of my classes yesterday, but it shouldnt be humanly possible to get suburned along your  hairline . God damn thining hair.....
