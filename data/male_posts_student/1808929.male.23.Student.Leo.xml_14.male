I mean think about it; those pictures that they've sent back are from a completely different planet millions of miles away! How the hell did they figure out how to do that? Plus I'm just so God-damned tired of the election year news: it's Dean....no, it's Kerry....no, it's Bush....no, it's whoever's got the jobs.  Spirit  and  Opportunity  are both out on the frontier of space exploration where one day man will hopefully live and have a chance to begin again.  Many people argue that we should be spending money to take care of our own first rather than trying to make it to Mars. My mother and I were talking about this the other day and that is exactly how she feels. While I really don't logical rebuttal to that, I just hope that my generation will accomplish something more than getting everybody health insurance, saving Social Security or whatever government program you want to think of. I don't want my generation to be known as the ones that had to clean up after and change the bed-pans of the baby-boom generation. If we have the ability to get out there into space then we should. There will always be shit to take care of here on earth. That will never change, but that shouldn't ever keep us from looking toward new frontiers.   This weekend was pretty good. I didn't really do anything special but watch some taped TV with a friend and study. I finally booked some tickets for Duke for spring break, so I'll get to go back and see my NC friends one last time. It'll be good and kinda weird all at the same time. Ok, I'm off to bed. Have a good monday.   Songs of the day: The Flaming Lips,  Fight Test , 2003. Train,  Calling All Angels , 2003. Radiohead,  Creep , 1993.
