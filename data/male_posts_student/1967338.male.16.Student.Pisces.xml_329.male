Ranked in Order from best to worst:  Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Mystic River Lost in Translation Seabiscuit Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World  I really don't have much to say, except I have to go see Miracle because  Jonah has a work ethic and Marten's parents are unsympathetic to my plight of having to go see a cheesy inspirational sports movie.  I'm done. Check out the new links! -> But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'
