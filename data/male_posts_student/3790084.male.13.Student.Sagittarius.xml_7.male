I am totally being attracted to his new song called  River South.    I played the song over n over n over again...  Although i can't really understand whatit's all about, but i am sure this song most probably written to recall back the previous  LOVE   ...   What do u think of  LOVE ??    LOVE  is blind, therefore when people fall in love; they only can see two people in this world (one is their own self , the other one is their partner.   LOVE  can make us really sacrifies ourself just want to see the our love ones happy.   LOVE  sometimes can make us out of control.   LOVE  is no longer there when we start doing comparison with the others.   LOVE  needs chemistry.   LOVE  can make any women to feel happiness in this world.   LOVE  needs courage.   LOVE  is a very complicated human's psychology   LOVE  needs trust.   LOVE  is just a  LOVE    So what do u think of  Hate ?  To  HATE  a person is alot more difficult than to  LOVE  a person. I would rather to  LOVE  than to  HATE . To  HATE  a person will make ourself unhappy thinking of that's person we  HATE . The feeling of  Hatred  can be control by ourself... We are the captain of the 30,000 soldiers who will listen to our order... keep on telling ourself that we are happy, cheerful; nothing will block our way to become a cheerful person and i believe this way will help our hatred feeling just fade away... try this simple medidation to enhance your beautiful life...   Remember : let our brain/ mind to control our body, not our body to control our mind~   Happy Always!
