YAY Well there were justified reasons for this early post because a few hours ago I was still at the amphitheater attending the class of 2004 Graduation Ceremony.  Since half of all my friends are seniors, the ceremony was rather nostalgic and emotional and it's unbelievable that some of your friends are already graduating, and forever ending 12 years of public education career! And yeah.....I saw Clark and VA there, and Evan Cate's speech was astounding.  I'll miss those seniors very much.......AND THE CLASS OF 2005, WE HAVE TO BEAT ALL THE STANDARDS THEY HAVE SET!!!!! WE HAVE TO BE BETTER!
