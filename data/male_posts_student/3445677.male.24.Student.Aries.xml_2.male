Latham is really getting good at pressing metaphoric flesh and he attempted to press himself against every one of Rove's viewers through screen of lounge room televisions accross the nation.  Let's get this straight - Rove is an idiot, yes he got three logies but only fools vote for the logies, his purile humour and harmless interviewing techniques have to be admired for the aptness with which they are aimed at the average cesspit of an average Australian mind.  Occasionally he does good stuff but Corrine Grant's mouth is too big, even if you shoved Rove in there whole it wouldn't shut her up...but the Goat digresses, the interview started well with Latham making cracks about Miriam (a random mexican transsexual who has the tentative claim to fame of appearing on channel ten)and admitting liking to watch one hour of popular television a week and that he used to enjoy Temptation Island.  With pat preliminaries out of the way, Rove began to throw his Patented Interview Curveball's and boy did they really sizzle home.  Latham, though, repeated his arguement for the inclusion of Peter Garret as the candidate for Kingsford Smith - "a person like that is good for Australia if he's in politics as part of the labor partay."  He went on to define himself as a straight shooter who has taken crudity out of his vocabulary and purjured himself a few questions later when he answered - "How will your relationship be with George Bush should the both of you win your respective elections?" with his answer to "what will your attitude to America be if you're elected."  His actual answer to the second question was and I quote: "Well, Rove, as we say in Politics, I've already answered that with the previous question."  Eeeerrr, no, Mr Latham, you haven't.  What you have answered had nothing to do with your personal relationship (and you have been quoted saying some rather nasty things about him) with George Bush.  Latham's "straight shooting" lasted about four questions.  A record in politics maybe but not good enough to escape the eviscerating knife of the Goat.  Ah, yes, the Goat senses more eviscerating over the Garret affair as well but we'll follow that as it breaks.  Latham, ever the young at heart and anxious for all the support he could get promised Rove that he would reappear on the show if he was elected.  That's right, who wants to interview a defeated candidate for Prime Minister?  Latham ignored this little subtext of Rove's question.  The best part of the whole interview occured at the very end.  Rove hadn't really managed to throw a good Curveball at Latham - he'd even forgotten the end of a Latham quote he was meant to use when talking about Latham being a Loose Cannon and foul mouthed to boot.  "A conga line of something - o damn - I've forgotten the word."  Latham promptly jumped in and answered the question.  Rove, however, had remembered by the end of the interview so he thanked Latham for all his hard work on the show and then began to crow - "A conga line of suckholes, that's what you said, a conga line of suckholes."  The fear in the eyes of Latham was extraordinary...the interview had gone without a hitch and rather well the Goat imagines his witchdoctors would be saying but then in one fell swoop, as if Johnnie Howard had possessed Rove, all of Rove's viewers will now remember Latham stuck in his chair while Rove fell about laughing crowing dancing and generally laying the old steel toed boot into Latham's creaking ribs and uttering "a conga line of suckholes, a conga line of suckholes."  Little Johnnie has a really nasty JuJu man somewhere who is pulling strings and contorting complete strangers for there is the lasting image of the interview, Latham burrowing into his chair being forced to grin and bear being told that he'd called liberal politicians a conga line of suckholes without being able to defend himself on NATIONAL TELEVISION.  Ahh, the election hasn't even been called and already the JuJu men and the Witchdoctors are honing their powers for their dark masters whose hands must forever remain lily white for as they all know, Pilate's big mistake was admitting that his hands needed washing, note well that Johnnie has never done a Pilate, he makes other people do that so his hands can remain white in stark contrast to the black filthy grime of his tattered and battered soul.  Stay tuned to the Mojo Wire as more comes to light and the Goat ducks and weaves to the tune of a JuJu man.
