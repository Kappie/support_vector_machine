However, this is not one of my favorite pictures of all time simply because of Gabe "Finally Cured of Singletis...Again" Resneck's interesting reaction to a normal, chocolate cupcake.  No, it is also because of the complementing reactions of Sonia "Ooh, Look at Me, I'm Dating Gabe" Rosner and Jessica "Dishwashers Are For Storage" Lee to his side.  Starting with Sonia, we notice a bizarre expression on her face. While it could be many things, be it suppressing a laugh, or maybe "sizing up" her chocolatey prey, I believe it is fear. Fear of the unknown. What could possibly be in this cupcake that could make it so good? Be it drugs, hormone-laced milk, or a vortex to another dimension, Sonia acknowledges the power hidden inside these apparently normal cupcakes. A power that she will have to soon confront on a much more personal level than she desires, when she turns to her left and sees Gabe's reaction to the cupcake.  Jessica seems to have a more natural reaction to the cupcake. Using her Asian skills, she has mentally pictured in its entirety the chemical construct of the cupcake. Seeing it as it truly is, nothing more than a few atoms here and there, she is forced to contemplate the patheticness of human existence. On her face, we see the disgust of someone who has reached enlightenment. Now she is left to gaze at the cupcake, and fondly remember simpler days when such delectable goods were all it took to satisfy her. Poor Jessica.  Gabe I'm not even going to coment on. He's just too stupid.
