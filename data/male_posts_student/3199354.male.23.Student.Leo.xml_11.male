Its found its place in  urlLink my blog , as a video in my profile on  that site , and on one of my favorite mix CD's for my car. Speaking of cars, I may be getting a new one soon. Ahh, decisions decisions. I hope my friends can afford to join me in that house. A loft, hot tub, two-story whatchamacallit style living room, dining room, deck, lots-o-land, great swimming, trails, private...what more could I ask for? Well, I can think of a few things. Don't worry though, I'll have those too.     What's still everywhere I have speakers?   Kanye West,  Jesus Walks    God show me the way because the devil try'na break me down The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now And I don't think theres nothing I could do now to right my wrongs I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid cuz we aint spoke in so long...
