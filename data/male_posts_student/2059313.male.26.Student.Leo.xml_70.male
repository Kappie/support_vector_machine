I've never felt so peaceful about a choice I've made.  Everything I've done in the past four months, You've used for a greater plan than just my selfishness. You are wonderful, and amazing, and graceful, and forgiving.  And I'm glad that I know You, and that You have used me and grown in me and hopefully I've let Your awesome-nicity shine through in my day-to-day actions.  I trust You with my life, now more than ever.  So how's that girlfriend thing coming along?
