But considering I've only written three songs in my life, one being 'Bier, Bier, Bier, ich trinke gern viele Bier!!!' and another being 'He's So Great', an ode to my greatness, I think I'm entitled to some head-fame. Of course, the poor medium of electrons hitting a phosphorescent screen cannot truly capture the fireworks, elephants and cannon, but here are the approxiamate lyrics:  HE'S SO GREAT (An ode to the my Greatness)(Abridged Version)  *Orchestra and Brass Band start up. Choirs (3 of them, 1000 strong each) begin to sing:* He's so great, he's so great, I can't believe he's so great, He-e-e is so great, can't believe he's so great, he's so great, great, great, He-e-e is so great!!  *Tap Dancers (1000 on each staircase) parade down double-staircase. They too join in the second verse:* I can't believe he's so great, he's so great, great, great,  He is rea-ll-y great!! Can't believe he's so great, he's so great, great, great,  He-e-e is so great!!  *Brass bands (2 of them, each of 250 men) march in to accompany those already onstage. The tap dancers form huge dance lines:* He's so great, he's so great, I can't believe he's so great, He-e-e is so great, can't believe he's so great, he's so great, great, great, He-e-e is so great!!  *1000 tap dancing elephants can-can onto the stage:* I can't believe he's so great, he's so great, great, great,  He is rea-ll-y great!! Can't believe he's so great, he's so great, great, great,  He-e-e is so great!!  1st Choir: He's so great! 3rd Choir: He's so great! 2nd Choir: He's so great, great great!! Everyone: He-e-e is so great!! 1st Choir: He's so great! 3rd Choir: He's so great! 2nd Choir: He's so great, great great!! Single Opera singer: He-e-e-e-e-e-e-E-E-E-E-e-e iiiiiiiihhhhhsssss sssssooooOOOO GRRRE-e-E-e-a-A-a-A-TTT!!!!! 1st Choir: He's so great! 3rd Choir: He's so great! 2nd Choir: He's so great, great great!! All singers together, as music reaches its climax, which puts even the rest of the amazing spectacle to shame, and also as a giant picture of me unfurls at the back of the stage, spotlights shine upon it, fireworks go off, creating vast indoor explosions, and incidently setting the roof on fire, and cannon and guns go off, making clouds of smoke and demolishing vital supports: He-e-e-e-e-e-e-E-E-E-E-e-e iiiiiiiihhhhhsssss sssssooooOOOO GRRRRrrrrrRRRRR-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-E-e-a-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-A-a-A-ttttTTTTTTTT!!!!!  *I, the only patron of the vast theatre which seats 100,000 claps wildly, as the performers gasp for breath.*
