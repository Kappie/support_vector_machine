Went to Gwinnett Place with Britt yesterday andme and him both got good deals on Hilfiger stuff. Tonight, I'm going to see Retrospect,VA Coalition, North Mississippi Allstars, and Collective Soul at On the Bricks. Traffic is going to be hell, but I'm not driving so I don't care.Oh well, I'm out...gotta go take the Expedition toget the oil changed and then go to Britt's house to hang out before we go downtown.
