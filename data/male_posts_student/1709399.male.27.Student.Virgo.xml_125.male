I miss all that action here and has to be satisfied with just CD's  cassettes. My father has been the biggest influence in me taking an active interest in Carnatic music. I remember when I was 10 years old we had this Raga Identification cassette series and my dad would identify Ragas in a matter of seconds and I would be left wondering how the heck is that possible ? He has been listening to the December season concerts for more than 30 years now and has an amazing knowledge on that subject.                                I never pursued carnatic music completely although the interest hasn't waned over the years.Whatever I know is mostly from Cassettes  CD's and also I never miss an occasion if there is a live concert around where I live. Hopefully I will start off my Violin lessons from new year  do well .
