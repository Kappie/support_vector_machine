Since my dad wants to share it kinda, he`s bearing all this costs and crap so its all good for me...Dunno what laptop i`ll be getting though...hopefully it`ll have wifi-capabilities....I desperate need it!!!!  Anyway I got my Aztech USB Modem connected and installed on my Packard Bell...and also reinstalled Norton Internet Security 2004 on it so my computer will be sufficiently secure from viruses and that sortsa crap.   MY COMPUTER SPECS ARE :         2000 megahertz (2ghz)   512 MB RAM  dvd rom/cdr-w combo  60 gigabyte hard disk  wireless Logitech keyboard and mouse  Diamond audio speakers and subwoofer  RADEON VE graphics card  32 MB tv-out  Much more crap   Price   RM6000   What i`m I using it for now?  Listening to music. Sigh. What a waste of power! Its a very powerful system actually! Just gotta work out the kinks and blah though I belive it has been worked out. It sure doesn`t seem to be worth the damn money it cost...anyway its  2 years old only..  It`s suppose to last like another 1 or 2 years according to my beliefs. But I think i`ll make it last five years in total. Just some fixes up and maybe a change in graphics card and i`ll be whipping some serious mutha fUcking Ass!
