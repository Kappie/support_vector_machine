I met a track star/turned serial killer last night. It felt so real when she ran by me as super speeds. I could feel the wind push me back; in the background, my friends screaming at me to move out of the way.  She ran from one end of the hall to the other. stopping at the end, just enough to get a look at her - and then she zipped away.  What a weird mess - no one cares about dreams or even really wants to hear it.  Yesterday I went out to Burger's Lake - my mom invited me. Little did I know, it was a CHURCH event. I let me disgust be known with my brother and mom that I was not aware that this was a church fuction. Luckily there was no type of service and I really didn't even talk to anyone from the church.   For the most part, I had fun. The place looked extremly crowded but I was not bothered much by anyone. I did almost get a paddle in the head from one of the 'rowing' life gaurds. I voiced my distasted with his ability to row a boat - he seemed more afraid than most people I mouth off too. That was an ego boost.   I also did a little snotty remark to a large mexican man - he was nice about it. He was yelling out to his kid not to be S'CARD and I mocked him and he politely corrected it by saying SCARED. I was actually surprised he heard me.   Today has been about the same as any work day. I called a few apartment complex's in Santa Rosa, Ca and tried to weasel a Move In Special out of the nice ladies. No dice. Three weeks before we load up the truck and take a very long road trip.   current mood:  silly
