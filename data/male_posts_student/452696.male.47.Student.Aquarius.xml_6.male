Hopefully it means I'm stretching myself and allowing some abstract thinking and creativity in. Work is wierder than ever lately. Go figure. I'm looking forward to leaving. Strange to feel this way about something I dedicated the last 25 years of my life to. Maybe I believed too much. Gave too much of myself over to a faith in other people doing what they are supposed to do, to move ahead and not just to preserve the now. I know it's right to leave, because I cannot talk about some areas of my present workplace without feeling anger and rage. Better I go somewhere else and channel that into something creative, rather than destroy myself by being where I am. O.K. I'm starting to depress myself now, so I'd better go work out and channel the feeling.
