I feel so uninspired to write in this blog right now.  Life has it's ways of just stacking things on you at any given moment, and it makes you feel absolutely terrible.  Things could be much worse, I know but in my mind they already are.  I have a warped way of looking at all things.  I take the worse view of things because most often, I put myself in that situation.  I really don't know why though.  It seems like that's just the way things have been for the last... let's see... 5 years.  More like 8 years though now that I think about it.  No one reads this I know.  I wish I didn't care.
