The kit uses a MiniDV camera, but shoots through a traditional 35mm SLR to achieve a film look without the high cost. This makes me wonder if there is some type of mount that would allow you to directly attach SLR lenses to a DV camera.   The setup looks like this:    Nate said that when he gets a MiniDV camera he's going to use my Canon AE-1 to create his own homemade Mini35. I guess this means when he does this, I can use his camera in return.
