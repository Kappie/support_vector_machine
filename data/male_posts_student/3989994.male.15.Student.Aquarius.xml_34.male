I cannot say though i can tell you you're not. Why are you jealous? why is a person jealous? Is there any justification for such strong raging emotions i believe there is as there is always...sometimes we need to feel such strong urges or "humors"( shakesphere calls it humors, in their time they believed that the liver was where love came from) can only reassure us that we are human and that there is still things out there than we cannot get over, i mean what is a world without the failures?  Do not fear, the fact that there is a re-interview means they saw you as a likely target, do not fear be confident plan what you want to say now that you quite have the hang of the questions, be confident and do not falter.   A girl with ebony hair and an auburn gaze turns and walks away from love towards ambition, nothing should stop her nothing should make her fall yet something troubles her, she looks back into the shadows and she sees love always, never faltering . Steeling her self she puts her foot forward and her gaze now locked on her goal a soft radiating smile touches her lips, beauty exist in many forms, strength and confidence is just one.   Believe, and you would succeed do not look back, you know you are meant for it do not regret nor should you feel anyone else is better.  With luck and ever lasting warmth
