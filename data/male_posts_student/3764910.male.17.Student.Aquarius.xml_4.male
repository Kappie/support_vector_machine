Very amusing. Not going out tonight though. I'm staying at Sarah's and we'll be watching Shrek 2. Been wanting to see it for ages. should be good.  Oh yeah, i decided to buy a domain name and some webspace. www.schoolofassassins.co.uk A site for my band and various other crap that i'll probably get very bored with.
