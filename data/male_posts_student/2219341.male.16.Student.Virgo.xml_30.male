WHY MUST THIS HAPPEN AGAIN!?!?!  you dont know how scared i am.  how come now when i need someone the most they arent there...i mean have you ever felt like you love someone so much and they're right there but you cant reach them?  man it's the worse feeling ever!  i feel alone and seperated again.  even though i am not.   	yanno what one of the hardest things for me?  ok now this is gettin real personal and you're lucky im sharing it cuz right now i dont mind gettin personal.  the hardest thing for me is to put all my trust in God.  i mean i know in my head that no matter what happens to me in my life that there is a reason and God knows what he's doing.  but then there is my heart and that deep dark corner of my heart that doesnt want to trust somethin that it cannot see.  or maybe its that what God wants may not be what i want...and that scares me.  of course i know he knows what he's doing but my stupid puny human heart doesnt want to accept that if its not what i want.  i know that's so selfish.  maybe its cuz im scared that ill have to climb the mountain i've already climbed.  the mountain that i dont want to climb again.  that was the worst thing.  i dont want to have to do that again.  my God just give me another chance....please?  dont take away from me what i love...please? 	gosh life can be very hard sometimes.  on top of all of this i also had to go get blood taken.  NOT FUN AT ALL!  i almost fainted when they took it cuz they were just suckin it out and i didnt have much sugar in my blood and then the vein clamped down so they had to stop.  i had to like get back to normal and then they had to get the rest of the blood from the other arm!  so now i have 2 holes in my arms!  sheesh!  not fun at all...im not EVER doin that again!  anyways...not lookin forward to tomorrow...i gotta lots of work to do and then all that other stuff i've already explained (sorta)...i want everything to be ok again...i want it to be good again and i dont understand why it cant be...and how things can just change...i dont understand...
