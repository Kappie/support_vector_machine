I hope you had the time of your life." -Green Day, "Good Riddance"   there are some things you have to know about the DC trip.   40 eight graders take a trip to DC and NY at the price of $1600 and some other expenses for souvenoirs.    Day 1     at 4:15 i called janis and told her we were coming to pick her up. the car ride was icy cold. i could feel my stomach twist. my skin hummed with eagerness. we met at the airport around 5:30 at the United terminal, San Jose.   my stomach still feels knarly and i take some pepto bismol. anyway, we check in. my partner is teena davis. i�ve known her since like.. 1st grade..? prolly. she�s really cool and i couldn�t have asked for a better buddy. we check our bags and Mrs. Chavez gives us our boarding passes so we head to the gate. teena got stopped in security cause she had 40 hair pins in from grad. night. good times, good times.   we were all sitting around in the gate.  maya brodkey, ryan juntado, sarah rorvick, lisa vechionne, amanda yabarra, des cook, cerena barros, tessa libby, kate kahoano, kevin grassadonia, delia guerrero, nathalie servin, kevin deming, miguel dolores, teena davis, des cuneo, lizette lopez, jessica llanos, angelica solis, neil osterman, stephen mccon, elena rossman, miki burns, augustine perez, aaron melim, janis dinkins, lexi tenney, aly rumpanos, matt starkey, isais dolores, ashlee dominguez, kassie dogherra, ben fisher, jaime sanchez, ashley sanders, scott glass, dan.. um.. something, maddie flood, valerie getts, roxy rafi-tarie, elena jin and michele chelman.   anyway, we�re all sitting waiting for jocelyn zimniki to arrive at the airport.  now dont get me wrong, jocelyn�s one of the coolest people i noe, but at this point we are all a little angry at her.   she shows up and check�s in and before you noe it we�re on the plane, sweeping off the ground. daredevil played on screen and some of the kids (mikaela) watched it in espanol. ha ha. we ate fruit, took pics and when they turned the fasten seat belt sign off we got up and PARTIED! seriously, the walkways were crowded with kids.   it was crazy! we swapped CDs, played cards, read magazines, desiree cuneo (who i sat next to) even broke her chair.. you noe, the normal stuff. (i was also sitting next to teena.)   when the movie ended a blooper/comedy show came on and then NBC was up after that. lexi sat behind me and we were listening to the grease soundtrack, cause she played Cha-Cha in a play. �it�s raining on prom niight!� i brought that CD just for her.   uh oh! we hit turbulence half way into the flight. the second time we all were rushed to our seats. teena ended up with Maya and Matt behind me, and Maddie was next to me. Des still stayed by the window.   we still swapped CDs, and my graduation mix made elena and mikaela cry. aww. i was having tons of fun and we werent even in DC yet! des shuffled cards while maddie fiddled with the air vents.   the stewardess came around with soda. one ginger ale please. maddie and i took turns throwing pretzels at each other :-D.   the captian turned the sign off and we all moved around. Matt ended up sitting next to me. Des was figuring out her new digital camera, and matt played his gameboy.   we�ve landed at our gate, D16, in the Dulles airport. just imagine, 5 hours ago we left gate C2 at San Jose. I wonder if anyone got there bag sent to Cuba.. ha ha.matt and i had the same time on our watches.. and miki said something about making out with her cheek..? oo yeah, those blanket that had been touched by naked bodies!   we got our bags and yummy candy and then we stepped out into the humidity of the East Coast. it was a relief when our AC�d bus drove up.   We drove passed some famous sites, the Potomac, the Washington Monument, Smithsonian, White House, Federal Reserve and the Department of the Interior (don�t ask...)   There was a parade in front of the White House. lots of military vehicles and what not.  we passed more sites, a car being towed, a bus of old people, American History Musuem, the National Achives and the IRS!!   Starkey made a funny quote �Some people are smart, some people are not...�   our chaperones for the trip were Mrs. Chavez, her son and daughter: Mike and... um... the daughter. and also our librarian, Gayle Rorvick! She�s really cool.   we drove into Union Station and peered at the top of the building. Fire, Electricity, Freedom, Knowlegde, Agriculture and Mechcanics. all things that helped man evolve from the primitive beast he once was.   we j-walked to the train station, where we found a REALLY COOL food court. we bought pizza and talked about how Nathalie got hit on!! by an old guy!! that�s when i first met nathalie. well.. not first met, but first had a real conversation with.  Nathalie and and I got gelato ice cream. mm. and then i bought a pint of lemon ice cream for our room. Ahh! Mrs. Chavez said it would melt before we got back. we had to eat it super duper fast. I ate with Matt, Kassie, Nathalie, Janis, Teena and Aaron, but left to go shopping with Jessica and Amanda. I took the ice cream with me :-D.   We looked at books and finished the ice cream. we even saw a really cool train! we met up with Aaron, Matt, Kassie and Teena on the way out. Jessie said she�d she me on the bus and Matt was like �or in hell!� Then Kassie and I walked back to the bus taking pictures along the way.   on the bus we sang �Baby Got Back� and then our tour with Hopi got under way. We drove to the Jefferson Memorial and i got some cute pics of Miki, Elena, Elena and Lexi. there was a really big ledge too.. Jocelyn almost walked off it.   then we headed to the to the Roosevelt Memorial. Hopi (our tour guide) asked �do we need a bathroom break?�, Jaime yelled �NO! We got cups!� and then Miki was like �Not all of us are like Kevin..�   the FDR memorial was really cool. there were a bunch of waterfalls and we got a bunch of photos. it was really hot tho.. if i stayed outside any longer i would�ve friend like bacon. Matt said the Washington Monument looked possesed.. and then he said sweat was good hair gel. lol.   i�ve known matt since preschool.. more or less. he was friends with my cousin Kalie. his mom knew her grandma or something... yeah.. anyway, he was prolly my first best friend.   anyway, there was a bunch of rain and lightning. rorvick and i were gettin� pretty freaked out.. Matt said a bunch of things �Guys take showers so they don�t smell worse,� and �Maybe we could hit the guy who didnt make a california avenue.�   we went to a supermarket to buy stuff for our room. in line, Matt, Aaron and I stood behind a drunk guy in a dress! he was buyin� Burban! lol. then we got back on the bus and it started to pour like never before.   when we got to the hotel, Karen checked us in and we went to our lucky room. 509!! Mike came by and gave matt his medicine, and then we got ice to chill our drinks.   Kassie and Teena and Ashlee came up to see us when this creepy old man came over and said �I will not tolerate loudness, I have two 8 year olds in a bed and I will not have you waking them out. One loud noise and *snap* I�ll call the front desk and you�re outta here.�   we spent the rest of the night talking to everyone on the phone.   some hot gossip?   Tessa, Kate and Cerena got a security gaurd assigned right outside their door.  Des Cuneo, Nathalie and their room buddie have a fridge! They said we could store stuff in it...  Kassie, Teena and Ashlee got their phones disconnected!   kassie came up to get ice and i saw tape on our door and thought mike had sealed it, but he didnt and anyway, teena sealed it and we got ready for bed. Mike came to tuck us in and that�s when we found out he hadn�t put the tape on! he talked to us about tomorrow and about our �traumatizing� run-in with the old red neck.   everyone went to bed and i stayed up, in the bathtub, writing in my journal.    Day 2    we ended up talking until 2 the night before. the red neck was banging against our wall, but we weren�t being loud.. lol.. in the morning we woke up, showered, and went down to breakfast. I had eggs and cereal.   then we walked to the lobby and found a handicapped bathroom! it was so cool! it opened by itself!! and then we rode the escalators. then on bus, we heard about how elena rossman ran into her closet mirror because she thought it was open.   elena is awesome! i�ve known her since 5th grade... maybe longer.. yeah , i think longer. but anyway, shes really nice and fun and friendly. one time i threw a phone book at her and it hit hurt in the head. i bought her candy though! lol..   we headed to the Veitnam Memorial and we all got carnations to put out for soilders. our first stop was the Korean War memorial. 19 soilders lined up on the tundra. next we visted the Veitname Memorial, with 58,226 names cast in stone, the place felt lonely. empty. names. all names.   i left a carnation under Micheal A. Walter�s grave thinking he might be related to Cooper... that kid is so perverted.   anyway, we walked to the Einstein statue and took pictures. there was a rumor that if you touch his nose, you will get smarter. i touced it... twice... just in case. we got back on the bus. woo, that AC relieved me. oh yeah.. miki is goldylocks.. and janis is a hyena? i dunno, those two are crazy. Hopi had a bunch of sweat stains on her butt... lol..   George Pataki and Chris Cox. New York Senator and California Representative. I met them both! We got out of the bus and headed to the front of the Supreme Court building. thats the judical branch. these hairy guys came up to us.. i think they were making fun of people who wore fur cause they were dressed like cave men.   anyway, we took pictures and i told tessa that her family had come to resuce her from civilization. �Smile and say FAMILY REUNION!� yeah.. you had to be there...   then we went to the Library of Congress. there was a naked statue of Neptune in the front. with a 9 incher! Inside the library we saw a bunch of books and there was a really cool zodiac floor! Nathalie and I love it! There was even the first book ever printed!   we walked to the capitol building and I met Chris Cox from New Port Beach! He shook my hand! It made my day. we went in the building and we saw TONS of priceless artwork. it was amazing. De Soto, Columbus, The Pilgrims, Pocahontas, The Declaration, Saratoga and Yorktown were some of the paintings.   we also saw a bunch of statues and learned a lot about the capitol. then we met george pataki. on the capitol building lawn, there was a protest. �Circumcision is wrong! The foreskin is not a birth defect!� boy, that prolly made the jewish boys behind us very happy. oo! alec is jewish!   yeah, back to story. oh we went to McDonalds next and we have to eat EVERYTHING we bought. I ended up eating everything everyone else didnt want too.. Fries, Milkshakes, McNuggest (Nathalie calls them �Muggets�) and more fries. i left them a souvenior the janitor will never forget. Kassie said �we should take a picture of the fries!� and kate was like �just look in the toilet tomorrow!�   Next we stopped at the White House visitor center. I picked p some stuff for Mr. Sullivan AND! i got a coloring book! yay! we walked back to the bus and stopped at the White House. I got a stick from the lawn! it was really cool. and i saw the West Wing! That is a really good show...! there were a lot of squrriels too.. we walked past Alexander Hamilton and the Treasury Building and we even saw a monument to General Sherman! it reminded me of Gone with the Wind.   we then went to the Holocaust Museum and watched a story about a boy named Daniel. it was really sad. there was even a little walk through thing and Lisa V. was my partner. Lisa is really cool.. and really nice too.   then we went to the old post office and went up a glass elavator. it was ok, the veiw was kinda weird, but hey, i had Kevin grassadonia�s booty scrunched close to me for most of it, so it was great. coming down the elevator, teena scared me to death. we left the old post office and headed to..   THE INTERNATIONAL SPY MUSEUM! way lamer than it sounds... i got a cool shirt tho. and i beat kevin g. a lot though at this weird game. ha ha i won. we got to climb through an air duct too! it got really boring.. but then there was this thing where you could see ur house on a satelitte! it was awesome! i bought a sweet t-shirt that says �Deny Everything� yay!   it started to rain and we got back on the bus. soon we stopped at a pizza place. matt got cheese poured in his hair and i made kassie laugh by saying �Cheese Me� when the waiter came around. Well we headed to the Lincoln memorial after that. we took a bunch of pictures and learned a lot about old Abe. He was really tall...   we went shopping at this little place with a bunch of street vendors and the rain began to pour. we got back on the bus and headed to the Kennedy Center for Fine Arts. there were flags from every nation except Lybia, Iran, Iraq, Cuba and North Korea. we also got to see into an opera and we saw a hall of states. then we went up a balcony and took pic.   Next, we drove to the Iwo Jima memorial, where Janis and I were the tour guides. fun stuff. we took a bunch of pictures of the six soilders raising the flag and then we just wanted to go home and sleep.   when we got to the hotel, Janis and I used the phones to try and call Ellen. it as busy, but we met these 2 girls and janis gave them her room number. When i got to my room, the door was open and Aaron and Matt were gone, probably getting ice. Lexi and Elena called and told us to go downstairs to a party.   we brought candy and soda and MM they had cheez-its. we also got to raid Mrs. Chavez�s room and get free food. then we went back to our rooms and tried to get to sleep. but instead we ended up talking until three. we were really tired in the morning.    Day 3    FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH!!   today was the trip to Arlington national cemetery. after a quick breakfast we were taken into a world of sad sculptures and gravestones. we visited the eternal flame and the tomb of the unknown solider. the hike was a long one, but the changing of the guards was.. for the most part... worth it. it was kinda dramatic.. but it�s to honor the dead so i guess its ok. i liked it.   all in all arlington was good. after the cemetary, we headed for the washington monument. we rode the elevator to the top. well, the 100 floor. the look down was 500 feet! it was really cool, we got to see so much! after the monument we walked to the Smithsonian where we said �Aloha� to our tour guide.   we got to travel around the �Mall� which is the term used for the block on which the Smithsonian museums sit. We breaked and picked buddies. Ashlee and I headed for the Natural history museum and headed all the way down to the food court. we got soo much food!   i�ve known ashlee since kindergarten..? yeah, she�s really cool and funny. and she likes to read a lot, so if i ever read a book then her and i can have discussions about it.. its funner than you think :-D   anyway, after we looked at a bunch of gems and the Hope Diamond. 52.27 karat from India. there were a lot of crystals and stuff and i got a sweatshirt from the american history museum. we went across the street and walked down to the art museum. we bought a few bottles of soda. we took pictures in front of a fountain and then went into the air and space museum. thats where we met up with Janis, Nat, Valerie, Ashley and Lisa.  Nathalie and I ditched Janis and Ashlee and hid behind a fence thing that we thought was tinted (we can see out but they cant see in) Janis and Ashlee were walking aroundon the floor below. suddenly they look up at us and wave. Nathalie screams �I THOUGHT THEY COULDN�T SEE IN!�   we continued walking and we got in a WW2 plane! how fuun!! we checked out some rooms with planets in them and we looked at some space shuttles too.   at five we met matt, ben, aaron, janis, ashlee and everyone else in front of the museum. it was scorching hot but the bus came soon and we drove to the Department of Printing and Engraving. we saw moola being made and we checked out the gift shop.  on the ceiling there were motion censors, and my head almost set them off.   after the money place we drove outta DC. we drove to virgina and stopped at the pentagon mall where we went shopping! ee! ashley sarah and I went to abercrombie and then viki�s. it was so much fun! they had really cute undies in fcuk. then we went back to the bus, running through the rain to get to it.   back at the hotel, we all got dressed in our bathing suits and went down to the pool. i sat outside and wrote in my notebook since the rain had died down. i walked with elena back to the lobby but i realized i had forgotten my key. we went to the front desk to ask for another one, but they wouldnt make one for me.   teena walked me back to the pool and we got aarons key. i went into the elevator and teena said �be right back.� so i held the elevator and this guy came in and was like �going up?� and i was all �yep..� and then a while later he got out and teena came back and got in and he was like �going up?� and she was like �sorry.� by the time i got back to the 4th floor, elena was done showering and we all hung out. it was another hall party! i went in kevin�s room and we talked and yeah, it was fun.   i ran back up to my room and slipped a note under the door for aaron and matt. i also brought candy downstairs. the hall party was gettin� hot and i ran back to my room to get soda right when matt and aaron got back. matt and aaron went down to the party but at 10 we had to get back to our rooms and tuck in.    Day 4    that night we packed and packed and after we had cleaned our rooms we watched drew carey. i fell asleep tho and i slept like a log... or maybe a rock... i would say a baby but i guess babies dont sleep super well. oh yeah! that night i got a call from my mom and thats when i found out she was PREGNANT! the baby�s due February 16th! see ya all at the baby shower :-D!   anyway, the next day we woke up late and i brought a soda down for breakfast. when we were in the lounge i opened the soda and it SPRAYED all over me. i went up to my rooom and changed, and headed back to breakfast, but then kassie ran into me with a plate of eggs.. so i showered and changed again.   then matt came up to the room and we all brought our luggage down to the bus. wihtin a few hours the bus was moving and we had left virgina for good. we watched night at the roxburry and nathalie, matt and i laughed SO HARD! kassie slept in the hallway. crazy. but anyway, i fell asleep during the movie, but nathalie and matt�s talking woke me up.   after the movie we made a pit stop in Delaware. i missed Maryland! we took a bunch of pictures in front of the �Big Guy Restraunt� statue. when we got back on the bus we drove to New Jersey while watching Orange County.
