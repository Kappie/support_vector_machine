We had at least twelve hours of driving ahead of us AND we wanted to check out New Ulm, a large German settlement located farther from the Interstate than previously believed.  So we never made it back to Terre Haute as planned (costing us some motel money) AND we didn't see a lot of the cooler stuff in New Ulm.  But alas, you lose some, you lose some. urlLink
