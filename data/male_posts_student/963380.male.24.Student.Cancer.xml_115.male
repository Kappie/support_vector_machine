Up yours geek counter counter culture. I shall be the counter counter counter culture. Ahem. I'm trying out some new browsers - Mozilla Firebird and Opera. Netscapes' been a bit of a write off for a while and Firebird is apparently rising from it's ashes. It appears to be pretty darned quick, which I'm liking so far. Opera's been neat to work with, I think I might have written about it earlier, it's got an integrated email client which I like.  I've started selling some things on eBay - apparently the chap who won my first auction will be paying me tomorrow. I was a little worried cause he's a dirty dirty frenchman and doesn't seem in the slightest corrupt. He seems in the extreme corrupt. Damnable French. We bail their well violated asses out in two world wars and look what they do.  *sigh*  Well this has been mighty cathartic. I did start another blog devoted entirely to my stargazing. I'll post the link post haste. Haha. Yeah. STFU n00b.
