I'm from Michigan, visting my father here in Portland and I bet there are some good hang-out spots here! I wanna just take my grandpa's keys there on the table and be off for the night!... My dad is too much of a light sleeper. He'll find me gone and you'll find me dead! Heh heh, that was funny! :) Oh, if ya wanna see some pics of me click  urlLink here ! Ugh, I'm feeling different emotions right now. I know that I want to get back to Michigan and see Bill but everyone else except for a few selected, I don't care about. Above all though, If Bill wasn't there, I would finish me two remaining years here without a doubt!
