Welcome to "Fides Quaerens Intellectum," [Latin: "Faith seeking understanding"] my weblog where I will pontificate on subjects like popular culture, politics, philosophy, and maybe even my personal life.  So why  another  one of these pages?  First, this will be different because it is  me  who is writing, so my insights will inevitably be different from others.  Second, I hate to break it to you, but this is not just for you.  I think this will be a good place for me to spill my guts as well.  Take it or leave it, the blog has begun!  Before I have my first real post, I guess I will say a short word about myself.  In a few days I will be moving to Michigan to begin graduate studies in philosophy at  urlLink Western Michigan University .  I recently completed a master's degree in religion from the  urlLink Logsdon School of Theology , and I have a bachelor of arts from  urlLink Hardin-Simmons University  where I double-majored in philosophy and theology, and I minored in biblical languages.  More about my academic life is available on  urlLink my website .  My most effective humor is extremely dry.  I am a huge fan of artistic music and film.  In many ways, I am an amateur writer and artist myself, some of which may appear in my future blogs.  You'll see more of who I am through my postings.  One last thing, like I said, I am moving to Michigan in a few days.  So, sometime in the near future I am going to be unable to post online for a period of time (maybe a week, I don't know).  Welcome to my blog, and come back when I give a  real  post!
