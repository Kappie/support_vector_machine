Several months ago, I saw a guy here at work reading a book about screenwriting during lunch.  I quietly filed the observation away and didn't act on it, until recently.  A few weeks ago I sent him an email (after figuring out his identity), and introduced myself as someone also interested in writing.  We had a good exchange, but business at work and a vacation on his part prevented us from actually meeting face to face.  Until today.  I'm about to go have lunch with him, and try to figure out what we have in common with the hopes of finding someone who has a strong interest in writing.  Hopefully the email exchanges are some indication of a positive conversation.  I'm also taking a sample of Wrecks with me to pawn off on him.  I'll report back later.
