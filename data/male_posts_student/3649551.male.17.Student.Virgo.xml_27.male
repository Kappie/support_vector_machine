He's one of two intellectual Irishmen ever to exist! (Oscar Wilde being the other, of course.) And if you're really on a roll, you know that they both spent most of their lives in England, anyway. So they hardly count as Irishmen. But it's a close enough call that I'm amazed by it. C.S. Lewis is an incredible thinker. I've just started reading  Chronicles of Narnia  for the first time since about first grade. I've read  Mere Christianity  and  Screwtape Letters  and would highly recommend them both. The man's work is deep no matter what he's writing about. Even  Narnia  is deep, which I'm coming to realize. I was far too young to appreciate it in first grade. I don't really know where I'm going with this. I'm still in shock that he was Irish. Irish ... how could it be? I heard a great and very random statement by one of the kids at that junior high camp. It was completely out of the blue at the time: 'I'm Irish. I mean, I like drawing leprechauns and when I find a four-leaf clover, I eat it.' Oh that is classic.
