Another thing is....he is so damn hott. He's half white and half filipino, and his case, that mix turned out just right. It was funny, I asked him if he was pinoy (filipino), and he said "Yeah! How did you know?" I was like well I'm full pinoy and your eyes are a dead giveaway. He like oh, haha. Yeah, so that was cool.   The other guy I met is named John. He is 25 and lives in Sacramento. John is the coolest of the two. He's kinda like me, except not like me. We share similar interests so I guess that's what made him nice to talk to. He told me that he had  Spina Bifida , which is a birth defect that causes spinal fluid to build in the brain a.k.a.  hydrocephaulus . I was shocked for like a second, he thought that I would freak but i didn't, but then I thought that doesn't make him any more different than you or me. I was glad that he did not have to be in a wheelchair though (because he's too cool to be in a wheelchair) because most people living with his birth defect are. He was also glad of that becase he was one of the lucky ones. This was the weird thing, we both said we were loners and didn't have many friends, but then we said that we've been loners since the third grade and we were just like....total shocker. (If John sounds familiar to anyone, it's because I told him to go to Brian's Place to meet and make some really cool friends.)  Tonight was a good night because I actually got to talk to Mike again, which is always a blast for me (and probably for him too). It was funny 'cause I was like alright I'll listen to you because you are like my foster dad. Then he laughed and said that was so true because I get my love for music and my musicianship and stuff from Brian and I get my love for Bryan Adams, insomnia, and my patience for computers from him. Hahaha so that was funny and put a gigantic smile on my face. His idea of having a tv show about our lil family (like everyone there) wouldn't be half bad, i'd definitely watch it. It'd be great 'cause there'd never be a dull moment what with all the amazing people that we got there. Then we did some computer stuff so he could get his background music on his blog working. Unfortunately it didn't work, so he said that he'd try again later. Then it was good night from there.It was funny though (you're all probably wondering, gosh isn't anything not funny to this kid?Well the answer is yes, but that doesn't apply to here), here's what we said:   "Night than kiddo" "Night dad. (omg did I just say that?) Hehe" "Yup you did, haha. Good night son." "Night." "I tell your other dad too." "He's still up?" "No." "Oh ok." "He is way asleep." "oOo." "But I will whisper in his ear." "Ok. Well tell him I said good night then too." "He is holding my pillow looking for me." "I see." "He is funny." "Hei I do that too." "Haha." "Hah ya." "Ok better go this time." "Aight. Night night." "Night." "Stop him from lookin for ya." "Yup." "Cuz youre found." "Ok ok good night." "Night." "Bye." "Bye."
