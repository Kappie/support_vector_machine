Batting first we scored a good 138 to put them under pressure, and with yours truly taking 3-9 in the middle of the game, and with Myles Capewell 3-12 just after we put ourselves in the driving seat, and put the pressure on to win comfortably.   Tommorrow I will be 12th Man for the Island team vs. MCC. This is unexpected to say the least, and it is probably only becuase of my enthusiasm and good feilding, but there is hope for the future, I just need a regular bowl. However, it is a start, and I have been 12th man before, so there is something good to look back on.   Today we see England take on Switzerland in the Euro 2004 crucial game. England cannot afford to lose, as they will be out of the competition. As I write we have a 1 - 0 lead, so things could be worse.   Anyway, I might post another entry after the game, but that's all for now....
