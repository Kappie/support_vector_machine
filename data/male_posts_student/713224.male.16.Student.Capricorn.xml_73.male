After the bird hit the ground in the warm pile of dung, he was happy and warm. Since he was so delighted in his new home, he began to sing a beautiful song. Then, hearing the song, a fox ran over and took the bird out of its steaming pile of shit, and wiped him off, then proceeded to eat him. Morals of the story: 1)Not everyone who shits on you    is your enemy. 2)Not everyone who gets you out    of shit is your friend. 3)If your happy in the shit, don't    break out in song.
