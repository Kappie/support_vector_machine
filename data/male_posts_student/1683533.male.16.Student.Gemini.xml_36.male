I havent done any shit to get ready either lol...I am still goin to bed late...I have no supplies...lol...this year is gonna be interesting I just know it...with the band and all...that will be fun...  Just watched Final Destination 2, man that was so damn gory...it was great...man...those was some cool visual effects...wow...lol....good movie...  Got my haircut....I was pretty upset at first cause...I had been growin my hair out for almost a year now...and I wasn't ready to cut it but my mom was really bitchen at me about it....there isn't that much of a difference...It is kinda straight now cause it was combed alot so it could be cut...but I hope it gets back to it's curley self before school starts...  My dog got skunked...fun shit...three days ago and he still has the smell on him...this is his 3rd time getting sprayed..he always seems to get himself into trouble...he does some pretty crazy stuff...one time at night he ran inside Frost Middle School lol...my dad and the janitors had to chase him down....  Nuttin else to say...bored as hell...this summer isn't goin out with a bang...more like a fizzle...and thats not cool...
