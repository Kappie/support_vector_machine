I was supposed to get a haircut but had no time, there's always tomorrow but tomorrow I gotta watch the damn wankstas. Oh how I hate to babysit, it's definetly not a man's job. I want to quit, I already got like $100, I don't need anymore. It's not worth it, it's a pain in the ass. Anyways, the god damn Yankees lost, they were so close to winning until the end. God, I hate Red Sox, I hope Paul Stoltz gets shot in the leg or something tomorrow because he says he's gonna wear all Red Sox clothes. What a fagget Jew. Ok, Yanks better win tomorrow night or else...or else...I'm bombing Paul...with elephants...wearing skii masks...in the dark. Bye.
