This is love indeed!"1 John 4:9,10 - Nathan Tasker                Your love changes me             I look in the mirror/At the man in front of me/Just a hazy reflection/Of all the things I want to be/I’m so frustrated by all the compromise/And I’m so embarrassed by the way I feast on the hollow lies/When your truth is so much sweeter/ And your love is so much deeper//Chorus/  You cannot love me more/And you will no love me less/Though I come to you with nothing/ And receive your righteousness/I come just as I am/Oh, but here’s the mystery/While I can come without changing/but your love changes me  //I sometimes imagine/ When I am all alone/ That given some more time/ I could have done this on my own/How could I be so blinded by my pride?How could I forget I was dead before you gave me life? For you are The Great Life Giver/and you are The Promise Keeper// Chorus // Bridge:   Nothing of my own I bring/ Simply to your cross I cling/ Well, nothing of my own/So I know it’s you alone/That gives me everything….For you loved before I loved you/And you’ve done what I could never do!  //Chorus//
