With all the hub-bub over the latest Moore flick, and some disturbing "You MUST see this" emails from some close friends, I have stumbled upon a new mantra for myself.  "I refuse to be spun."  So, I need everyone's help, I am on the look-out for Spin-free information.  Any ideas?  My issue is that I rail against the people who watch the Moore film and come out "spun".  It's a play on their own ignorance and they are too ignorant to understand it.  But then I realized, where are my beliefs rooted?  Is it because I myself have been spun (maybe even from the likes Todd himself, my main source of political information?)  I find myself in heated discussions re-hashing Todd's emails, not my own thoughts.    So I am on the look-out, along with Steve, for my  Own Opinion .  No more ignoring not having it.  Of course, I may have to give up this blog, and any hold on reality since it is impossible to be "spin-free".  So, let me amend my quest, I want  to be a regular reader of "extreme spin" news on both sides.  Maybe they will cancel each other out.  Ultimately, I would love to have a list of sites that will provide me with extreme spin news and some sites that are relatively spin-less.  I am going to start to gather this list and implement the plan as soon as possible.
