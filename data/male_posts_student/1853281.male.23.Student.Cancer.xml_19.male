Went home, finished the homwork and watched a dvd i got from amazon in the mail yesterday. Amazon, you are the devil, such a sweet sweet devil. Too little sleep once again, though i went to both of my classes, despite being sorely tempted to ditch my american history for dummies, freshman level even though it is listed as a upper-division, bright faced, ultra pc teacher, class. My good deed for the day feel like i should say something in honor of the day, not sure what to say except give peace a chance, or something equally cliche. Go read something by the dalai lama. Sit for a few minutes and try and figure out why you are motivated to do things. Be kind.  I'm sounding like the hippy i used to be gotta get back to tthe vital task of opening mail cheers
