'Cause free advertising is nice.  2. Did you have a senior quote in your high school yearbook? What was it? If you haven't graduated yet, what would you like your quote to be?  "If I care what this says in five years, slap me."  3. If you had vanity plates on your car, what would they read? If you already have them, what do they say?  If I had them, it'd probably be some esoteric reference only I would get and thus have to explain to people...  4. Have you received any gifts with messages engraved upon them? What did the inscription say?  Nope, never recieved anything like that.  5. What would you like your epitaph to be?  "So it goes." You know, from  Slaugherhouse-Five.
