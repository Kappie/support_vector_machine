The movie was to be called  urlLink The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  and it would only have a semi-alright story because it was loosely based off a comic book.  He started his dream by going to Trevor Albert, the producer of  urlLink Bedazzled , and asking him for some dough.  Albert replied by giving him a wad of cash, and telling him “Do what thou wisheth with yonder money!”  And when Norrington counted it, he had an epiphany. “But Trevor, this will leave us only a $100 dollars for use on actors, special effects, advertising, and etc!”  “But what the fucketh art thou going to useth the rest of the money for?”  “The rest is to pay for  urlLink Sean Connery  to act as the lead role!”  “Ah!” replied Trevor Albert. “ urlLink The Best Bond in the world …”  “Yes, it’s the only way people would ever watch this crap film I’m about to make…”  Trevor nodded understandingly. “Yes, well… I just can’t throw my money everywhere now can I? That $100 will have to do!” And Trevor fucked off.  And yet, it should have ended there for Stephen Norrington’s dream, but fuck, it didn’t. Norrington was a determined man, and he hired a horde of crappy animators (which he obviously imported from Latvia) and actors to star in the movie.  Actors such as Stuart Townsend ( urlLink Queen of the Damned ) and Peta Wilson (Who’s career, although not strong to begin with, appears to have died alongside the movie) for example.  Anyway, he managed to make the movie, which bombed so badly it made Hiroshima look like a fucking playground.  The point of the above post? None really, I just felt like writing something in addition to the subsequent evaluation of the  urlLink Sony Ericsson K700i .      The K700i    You see, for the past two weeks, I have been worrying about two things. Firstly, my net has become slower, therefore disallowing me from speedily downloading various forms of entertainment (not all of it dirty). Secondly, I have been trying to decide what my next mobile phone purchase should be. I had the choice between that Nokia mobile phone with the QWERTY keyboard, and the K700i from Ericsson.  I chose right.  Let me tell you why. The K700i is, first off, designed like an Aston Martin. Beautiful exterior (a few annoyances with this explained later on), and a powerful interior. I mean shit; I thought the world of mobiles had gone to the metrosexuals and female teens obsessed with colours that can cause epilepsy.  No, not the K700i!  It has a sophisticated silver finish, not too bright, not too dark. Its back even features a brushed aluminium finish! Oo and Ah with me! Have I mentioned the screen? It’s at a resolution of 176x220 (if I remember correct) and has around 65,500 colours. This thing has the most fucking ace screen I’ve ever seen.  I am not a joystick kind of person; I prefer buttons, which is why when I picked up the K700i I was a bit pissed to begin with, finding myself stumbling over and over again with it. But after around four hours of practice with the thing, I can now navigate with relative ease around everything, maybe stumbling once in thirty joystick presses. But this is to be expected, I’ve been a Nokia user for quite some time now, and the power I now hold exceeds anything Nokia has ever provided me.  Moving right along, the phone (battery included) weighs around 93 grams. This isn’t much, compared to  urlLink Nokia’s 7650  which is 154 grams, or  urlLink Nokia’s 6600  which weighs 125 grams. I was surprised at how little weight this thing has, since I expected a heavier bugger considering all the stuff that’s inside it, which is listed next.  - A camera capable of both image and video capturing. It has a 4x digital zoom. The quality of the pictures it takes currently surpasses most mobile phones on the market (I’m not versed enough in the mobile world to say it is the top mobile/camera). - 41 MB of space. You can load MP3 music from your computer onto your K700i and listen to it if you wish, or even use it as your ringtone!  - The games use Java, and though this may be a con to some, it means better graphics and such. The three games that come with the phone are all new to me, and fun to an agreeable extent (save the tennis game, which is making me feel like a bad gamer).  - A program called MusicDJ which allows you to create your own ringtones in the same way as the Apple program Itunes does. You choose a sound for the bass, the drums, keyboard, and accent (trumpets I think xD).  - Internet connectivity, this speaks for itself. You can download, if I am correct, new games and applications to your mobile rather than have to go through the computer. You can do that to through infrared, Bluetooth, or USB. You can even buy that Bluetooth remote control car and apparently use your mobile to control it… I think? xD  Anyway, Alec is bitching about me making another post, so I better stop here. But be warned, the phone supply on this phone is a bitch, and you will need to recharge it every day should you decide to buy it xD For me, this isn't half as big a deal as most people make it out to be, but hey, whatever suits you eh?  Selling Price? The best bargain would be US $249.99, but you will probably find it at around US $350.
