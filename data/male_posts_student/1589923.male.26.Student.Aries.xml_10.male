Well, still looking for a good bargain so that it can last me for my stay here in Oz. Life is getting slightly boring here, nothing much else to explore. funny how i seemed so excited to come here initially. hahah. so ironic. Oh well, whatever it is, i am making the best out of my stay here. i mean it's not often everyone gets the chance to stay here in Aus for a long period yah. Hmm.. i'm also considering the option of getting a PR. i wonder if that's a viable option.
