I sometimes forget all about my friends and that I actually have people in the world that think about me becuase I am out on the end of the u.s. I dunno what I would do with out mimi. My pets just guard my stuff.  Well, news flash, I got hired Full Time at the Bird Rescue Center. So I will be working my little buns off there. I am sorta glad to get out of retail for a little while. I am only working at the book store occasionally. I have been reading a ton in my spare time and at work alot. I rush around from one job to another, always late.  School starts next week and the book store still only has 1 out of 4 books I need. Fucking weird, but whatever.  Anyways, my job description is changing a bit at the center. I am dealing alot more with all the raptors that we handle. That is really exciting and super stressful. I had to go feed all of the guys we have out in the rehab mews(outdoor aviaries) and was flown at a few times. Not sure if it was aggressive but still pretty hott. I was sweating my ass off worried about talons in my pretty little hairless head.  Mimi and I ran out to Point Reyes again on Sunday to have some food at the beach and watch the sunset. It was amazing. The moon was full as well and bright has her beautiful eyes. It is so dark out there and so alien. It makes my heart heavy to think that I only paint buildings and street lights as familiar in my mind. Today, in the local paper, horrays were in order for a woman who survived a cliff fall in the seirras for four days with a broken femur, hip, and other injuries. Damn, thats tough.  I just wanna say it sucks to grow up.   current mood:  melancholy current music: ben folds - still fighting it
