Today I went out with my friends to celebrate my birthday. Actually, HuiMin was invited too. Two Cancerians celebrating their birthdays, post-celebration for HM, pre-celebration for me. Heh Heh.   I met Gloria and HuiLing. Heh. I managed to scare them by hiding down the lift's door. When it opened, I gave them a "boo!". Heh heh! KY scaring has risen up a new level! Wee!   Anyhoo, we met CQ and HuiMin in Woodlands MRT, then Joyce arrived shortly after. Yes. We decided to go pool first.   Heh Heh. We only played for an hour or so. Hann came along and gave me the video-camera. Thanks Hann! I will take care of it de, don't worry!   After pooling, we went to watch The Day After Tomorrow. That movie is so nice! I mean, it is thrilling at first, but the emotions behind it is so powerful. Esepcially at the end when both the father and the son were rescued, and people actually survived that freezing. So touching!   After the movie, they went to buy my present for me. Apparently, they decided that I need a fashion makeover. Heh. They decided to buy something new for my wardrobe. Heh. After shopping all around, they finally brought me 2 polo tees from Giordano. A yellow and a blue one. Heh. They look nice.   Okay. That's it for today la. Oh yes! Monica and Chandler finally can adopt a baby! Weee! Such a nice Thanksgiving episode! Meow moo!   Right. Okay. I said something about a poem right? I have chanced upon this poem in MNI. It's such a nice, but sad, poem about the big bad world we live in. What's it about? Gays. How they are treated in this world. Read on.     urlLink  Queer People     by Cheyenne   You'd rather have you closeted kids be unhappy  Than out and proud, and have to listen to the endless  Talk at the country club about the town's new  Rainbow prince.  You'd rather tell your best friend he's going to hell  Than remember that he's the one who built a tree house with you when you were ten  And went to detention with you in middle school so you wouldn't be lonely.  Some people couldn't even say the word 'homosexual'.  Even if their mouth was full of one.  Is that you?  Some parents think their kids aren't gay, just too warm  And kick them out on the freezing streets to fight or die  As some form of 'tough love' that might 'cure' them.  Is that you?  Strangers on the news.  Attacked with a baseball bat.  Kicked endlessly in their head and left to die.  Tied to a fence and beaten to death.  And you'd rather shrug and laugh it off.  'Another less faggot'.  And go on about your life, than shed a tear  And admit human decency  Besides, giving a damn about queers  Will make people think you are one  And then your life would be over.  You'd rather hire an incompetent heterosexual  Than a qualified gay man to spread his gay germs everywhere.  A friend tells another fag joke  And you laugh along, cuz ignorance in the short run  Is easier than enlightenment.  And when it comes to AIDS, you'd rather blame it all on them anyways  Than admit affects men, women, and children all over the world  Gay, straight, and everything in between.  That would be too much responsibility that could be dropped onto someone else.  People think queer means anybody that isn't straight.  But you're only truly queer if you refuse to love at all.    Nice ain't it? What a beautiful poem. Sad too. Sigh. The stupid homophobic world. Oh meow.   With that nice poem, I sign off le. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
