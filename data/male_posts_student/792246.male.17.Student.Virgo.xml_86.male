Jesus looked into his beautiful eyes, lost in the mist of fog surrounding his heart. He leaned forward to kiss him, pressing his lips into his, savoring the taste of his mouth, exploring each other with their tongues. They lost each other in their embrace. "Joseph", he cried out. His father was so beautiful.  Joseph loved his son very much. Even if Jesus wasn't his blood son, he felt a duty to look over him. So as he passionately kissed him, he started to caress Jesus's more private areas with his hands, squeezing his sensual love cheeks.  Someone knocked at door. It was Mary. "Jesus, your friend Mary Magdalene is here to play." They opened the door and gasped in horror. "Joseph, how dare you touch Jesus! You know he is only to make love to both of us at the same time! Now move over and let me have a turn. Mary, you may join us."  And the four of them spent the evening expressing their love for each other in various ways.  Amen.
