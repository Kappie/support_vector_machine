Or, Maybe Saddam has just been watching too many Michael Moore movies; he seems to think that he has done nothing wrong and that Bush is an evil dictator.  Excessive Moore-watching would definately account for Saddam's willful ignorance.  I still don't understand how someone like Saddam can refer to Bush as a criminal.  Seriously though, he's denying that he gassed the Kurds, and he tried to justify the invasion of Kuwait.  I think he believes that he didn't do any of those things.  Repeatedly, those in contact with him have referred to him as psychotic.  Even over the course of the hearing, he experienced several mood swings.  The man's a psycho!!  Ok, enough of that.  Let's look at the facts:  We  know  that he murdered the Kurds, no matter what he says.  We  know  that he had WMDs, and there is much evidence that they are still in existence (it is widely believed that he shipped them out of Iraq at the last minute).  We  know  that he had WMDs because he used them on the Kurds.  We  Know  that there was a connection between al-Qaeda and Saddam.   urlLink Here  an excellent viewpoint on their connection.  We  know  that he defied authority by refusing to allow investigators into his country, making a mockery of the "Oil for Food" program, and ignoring the U.N. in its commands for him to destroy his WMDs.  We  know  that he invaded Kuwait in order to "give (his army) something to do" because he distrusted them.  We  know  that he and his officials (including his sons) beat, raped, tortured and killed civilians for entertainment.    We  know  that Saddam and his loyalists have a  urlLink plan  for destablizing Iraq.  These are all things that we know, and considering the immense loss of life at Saddam's hands (not to mention all of his other crimes), I would say that the death penalty is the only just punishment for such a vile man.  I'm not the kind of person that goes around screaming for shoplifters to be executed, but some crimes against humanity simply must be punished.    He has been handed over to the Iraqis, so his fate is in their hands.  I hope they have the presence of mind to remember what he did to them and to make the right choice about his punishment.  It would be a true travesty of justice to let such a bloodthirsty villain live.
