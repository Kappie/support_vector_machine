The morning will eventually come and bring the darkness back home, And steal my eyes away from me Fumbling for you by moonlight, overlapping and entangling with you, I believed I could become your true hiding place   Burned on Burned on The place of our promise that will never return Run across the black-stained earth with a torn-off agony See, I can flutter better than you thought   If you can't hear me, even though I scream I want you to destroy me with your own hands While you can still hold me dear Your arms that hold me back Turn into a gentle dust A simply stare at the sky, silently   Burned on Burned on The inerasable scars left by the palms of my hands Sever a rift in the red-stained clouds with my torn wings Burned on Burned on The place of our promise that will never return See, I can flutter better than you thought  Favourite living creature at the moment: Crimson Butterfly
