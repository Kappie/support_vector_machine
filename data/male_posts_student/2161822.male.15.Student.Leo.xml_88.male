Understandable. What boggles my mind is how the paper goes from 10 pages, double spaced, to 15 pages 1.5 spaced. Due in a week. Obviously we have no lives other than to complete this busywork that won't help us in life except to perhaps keep currency flowing by buying weapons to channel our anger through. Well, maybe not that severe, but you get the point. I just can't understand how the 9th grade's research paper is 2 pages double spaced and ours is blowing the top off the pointless retarded assignment meter. Between that and Chem I'm about to rip my head off and throw it at one of my teachers. I'm so unbelievably sick of school. But hey, at least it's almost over. Plus this week is the bazaar. Except I have to work the Kiddie Land garbage. Outstanding. You just wait until summer. Then these painfully boring and whiny blogs will turn into great hymns of rejoice.  Listen to H.I.M.
