I don't care how many times Mrs. Spilsbury has disputed it, YOU CAN'T REVISE ENGLISH PROPERLY. It hurts to try.  Had me German oral today, I reckon it were grand. I may get all my marks taken off for saying "Ich habe nicht nach Deutschland gefahren" but still, unless they do that I think it went pretty well. That's a biggy, though, that one. I did manage to get in my random knowledge of German composers and their birthplaces though. Woo.  *waves at Laura for sake of waving at person that he... you know..*  Anyway, yeah, we got let out of school for study leave 2 days early so I actually left yesterday but I forgot to tell anyone. Ha. 'Tis OK, but it's not as good as a lot of people make out. It means I've got into 6 subjects a day revision a day early (technically it should be 2 days but I was in Gloucester buying supplies after my oral so I couldn't be bothered with it. I've done Maths and English, cope). Is that so much better than phaffing about at school?  Ack, Jazz and Ig sent me a story. Via Gwen's leg. What?  Quote of the day: "Talk to me, Jesus Christ. You have been brought here, Manacled, beaten by your own people. Do you have the first idea why you deserve it?"  From   The 39 Lashes   from   Jesus Christ Superstar   Love, Jon Roskilly
