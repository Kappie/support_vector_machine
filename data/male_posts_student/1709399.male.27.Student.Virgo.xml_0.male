Over a Lakh students from all over the Country would be competing for those few privileged seats at the presitigious IIM's (Indian Institute of Management) . After some hard thinking , I have decided to jump in the fray. Having already been unsuccesful twice earlier ,  this perhaps might be my last  final attempt. So its either now or Never. I always beleive I have it in me to crack CAT but never gave 100% in my earlier attempts  hope to break the jinx this time. B-School has always been my Dream  though I got a good GMAT score , I have to "Bell the CAT " this time else I might have to go abroad to get that elusive MBA. God Bless me.
