The previous company had sent several notification messages about making changes to email clients and news reading programs so as to "not miss a single message."  The other thing I just remembered was that my cable modem account comes with an email address. I rarely check it and, when I do, the only mail there is from the cable company. So I checked my "old" account one last time and discovered that I had yet another message reminding me to switch. I gathered the new information, made the necessary changes to my mail client, and told it to check my "new" account.  I had three messages: The first was a welcome from the "new" cable monopoly and the other two were spam promising to change my physical dimensions in very graphic ways.  Neat. New email address and new spam. Eventually the thing will fill up with garbage and no longer accumulate new messages.
