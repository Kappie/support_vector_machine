I'm not going to say that school starting is good or bad- it'll be great to see my friends again, get back me laptop, work on flash, all that good stuff, but...  My core classes stress me out so much it isn't funny... If i ever have to have Ms. Garling as my teacher ever again i'm going to end up eating her. She's not what most people would call "Predictable." Well, sort of.  You'd walk into the room, and there were a couple factors that told you how a day in her class was gonna be.  1. The looks on other classmate's faces(happy, pissed off, scared)  2. The overall feel(on a bad day, you can kinda walk in and feel her pissed-off ness... kinda like... a "pissed-mist") I'll post back later. I'm busy.
