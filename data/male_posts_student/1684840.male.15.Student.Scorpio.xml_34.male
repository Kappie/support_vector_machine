Yesterday I dug out the first part of a story I had started to write a while ago, and now I'm going to finish it :)  I think it's better than anything I've done so far!  Mum and sheldon went shopping earlier, while I kept sizzling poor Crash Bandicoot on hot coals lol.  Nearly a week to go until we're up on the bum aching aeroplane again, but at least this time I'll have my Gameboy to keep me occupied.  I'm going shopping soon for the sweets and things to bring back and amaze people with lol.  Can't wait for that.  Sheldon has to go to work again tomorrow :(  I've got a perculiar feeling that when I come back my cat's gonna HUGE!  He always looks bigger when we haven't seen him for ages lol.  Night all...
