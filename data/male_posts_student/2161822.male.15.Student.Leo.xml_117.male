The show was really good and it's a shame not alot of people came. But a show is a show and I know I enjoyed myself. Plus I got to see Jeff eat 100 paintballs. Weird thing is that's not the first time he's eaten paintballs. That was basically the highlight of the weekend. Yesterday was plagued with bad allergies. 3 hours of sleep isn't really enough. And I'm not sure why Angelfire is being dumb and not showing my pictures. This is the fourth time I tried Angelfire as a webshell and each time it screwed me over. So until I can figure out what is wrong (which may be never), no pictures. Such a shame. I feel like making a long post because since no one reads this it really doesn't matter. But all of sudden I don't feel like making this long. All of a sudden I have the urge to have some eggs. Potato chip. Plastic bag, plastic bag, plastic bag, plastic bag.... Listen to H.I.M.
