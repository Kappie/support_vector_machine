I help this guy several weeks back before I go on vacation.. the guy picks out the cheapest frame we have and puts glasses lenses in it (which like 1% of the population wear) and leaves knowing he picked out crap. So meanwhile I go on vacation and the guy comes in and picks them up. While he is in working with one of my co-workers he decides he wants a clip-on for the glasses. She of course orders some in for him.  I get back from vacation and end up getting him for my next patient and he tells me he is here to look at the clip-ons that were ordered in. I go back into the lab and get the tray I take them out to him. Every clip ordered in was too big or not quite the right shape at all. I say, "hmmm looks like she had the right shape on order and crossed it out.. no wonder they don't fit. There has to be a reason she did this." I tell him I will order the right shape in for him however the reason it was changed could be that they might not make the shape he needs in the size that he needs and that might have been why she changed it to something similar. I also tell him I will call him if that is what I find out. He leaves and I go back and call the company... sure enough that was the situation. I call three other companies only to find out the same thing. Ah yes.. keep in mind I also told him that if he wants a clip to fit exact.. we can order a custom clip made for that frame that will match exact but it has to be custom made and it costs 60 bucks non polarized and 90 bucks polarized. He ignores me on this saying it's too much.  So I call him back and tell him there is nothing available for that frame unless he does the custom clip... the 25 dollar over the counter clips simply don't come in the right shape and I tried all three of our clip companies. The asshole gets pissed and hangs up.  A week goes by and the guys wife calls and I take the call being pure luck. His wife proceeds to tell me that no one ever called them back. I proceed to tell her I called them back and talked directly to her husband not 15 minutes after he left the store last time and told him nothing was available. She goes on to tell me that we didn't call them again and what the hell are they supposed to do for sunglasses for him if there is no clip. I tell her they can have a custom clip made that is the only option. She says, "WE WERE TOLD A CLIP IS MADE FOR THIS FRAME THAT IS WHY WE BOUGHT IT!!" I say, "Well mam there isn't a clip made for it and if you want want you have to have it custom made.." she hangs up on me.  So five minutes afte that call the phone rings and my manager says... ok that's her again. Sure enough it was psycho bitch all over again... complaining about how we lied to them about the clip. The manager proceeds to tell them she may of found another kind of clip that MAY work and she will order it in and they will see what she can do.  So yesterday my manager calls in sick to work.. guess who comes in. Jackass comes in and says he is there to see the clips we ordered in. My co-worker goes back and gets them and they try them and they aren't even close to his frame. We tell him once more there aren't any clips for his frame. he says, "I WOULD HAVE NEVER ORDERD THIS FRAME HAD I KNOW THAT!!!" He then goes on about we lied to him and "I" told him he could get a clip and I sold him the glasses and that he wanted a clip. I of course am working with another patient sitting next to him and my co-worker. I had to chime in... "Sir we never even discussed clip-ons and you ordered these in while I was on vacation... none of the frames in the room you picked yours from have any kind of clip nor have we ever told anyone there is one. If you want a clip for it we can have a custom clip made and that is 60 dollars and polarized is 90 dollars." he goes on and on about how we told he there was a clip and he is gonna get a clip for it. We all tell him there is no clip and he says, " I want to see the manager!!" Well we tell him she called in sick cause her dad is in the hospital and she would be in the next day. "Fine I will be in tomorrow morning!!! this is ridiculous!!" he yells.  Today he neither called nor came in..  These type of people are the reason I hate optical.. I hate retail and I detest people in general. By the time I get home from work I am so turned off by people that I can stand to go anywhere. I will do anything that requires I don't have to go out in public and deal with more rude people. That is part of the reason I went back to school two years ago and picked computer information systems as a major.. work with computers!  Rob
