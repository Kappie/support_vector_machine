I wasn't going to get that drunk but of course I did...  then i went to Mark's house and played beer pong with himand his peeps..  got even drunker than walked home and called tons of girls in my phone but at least I don't remember that part.  Could tell by my called numbers.  Ohh well...  well if Catherine doesn't call me tonight I'm going to get smart and study..  might even go home and study.. that would be smarter probably..  ohh well..  i'm off to shower..
