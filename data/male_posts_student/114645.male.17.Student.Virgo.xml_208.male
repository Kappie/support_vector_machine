I have spent $250.55 since 6/13 on gas and my car gets an average of 22.25 mpg, and I spend an average of $2.01 on gas. I have had a total of 11 fill ups equaling 124.4 gallons of gas. That means I have driven over 2600 miles since the 13th of June. Holy shit! There ya go Mr. President! I hope this makes your friends at Big Oil and OPEC happy!
