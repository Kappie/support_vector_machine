Ya know, I've been thinking lately (pretty much for the past 20 minutes) why I like doing these things and I think I know what it is. I think I like doing these things because it makes me think that people care that I'm doing something like learn how to play guitar, or even that I'm doing anything. I guess it also helps reinforce my delusion that I'm getting decent. Well, whatever the reason, I like doing these so regardless of what you people want, I'm doing more. It's my blog after all and if you don't like listening to them, just don't click the link. It's not like anyone's forcing you.    urlLink
