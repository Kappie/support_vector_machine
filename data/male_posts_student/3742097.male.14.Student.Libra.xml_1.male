But I checked the weather for the Bronx and I checked the Doppler radar, it all looks good. But now I have a crisis. I don't know whether to wear pants or shorts. It will reach about 80 degrees today, but do I really want to wear shorts and show off my legs? Ummm NO. And the bus ride will be cold, but I will be hot sitting down. And I may get a tan with shorts, but maybe I will not because of where we are sitting. If only I knew if I was in right or left field, then this would all be solved.  Anyway today should be great, it could only be better in the Yankees put a beating on the Mets. But not too much now, I want to see Mo Rivera. I have seen him in every single Yankee Game I have ever attended, except for one. 1998 verses the Devil Rays, a game that started at 705 and ended around 11. Oh boy was it a blow out...for the other team. We lost by like 10 runs. But to you remember that film The Rookie? Well that guy, the pitcher, was at the game. I don't know if he pitched, all I know is that he was in the ballpark.  Well I better hurry off now to solve my crisis. They should invent an article of clothing that turns from AE Jeans to AE Shorts. Ahh goodbye!
