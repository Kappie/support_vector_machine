Although now, having talked to Shez, I might not be able to take her on account of going into town early to hang about with Shez so he's not "bumming around town" on his own.  I'm actually kinda stuck for things to say, to be honest not so much has happened with me over 1 day. Although, discounting today, I've got 2 days until I can eat chocolate again. Yum.  Oh, and I got Fi to comment on my last post. My blog miss√©d her, so I got her to stroke it. And thanks Patrick for your dirty mind, I'll remember to twat you for that next time I see you ^_^.  Quote of the day: "Be still, my soul, The Lord is always with thee. Bear patiently The cross of greif or pain. Leave to thy God To comfort and to share thee. With every change, He faithful remains."  Probably wildly inaccurate lyrics from Sibelius'   Be Still, My Soul   Love, Jon Roskilly
