I have grown so much and need to evaluate where God has been taking me and set new targets for the final term and onto second year!! me and the boys had a bit of fun watching the womans shot put last night, we just couldn't figue out though some of these girls just looked to masculine, it was almost enough to give us night mares what do you think??    german pic  18/08/2004 © GETTY IMAGES/Scott Barbour hands up pic 18/08/2004 © GETTY IMAGES\Michael Steele russian 18/08/2004 © GETTY IMAGES/Scott Barbour
