I find it really funny that LN has exactly one Native American student.  I think I know her. You know what annoys me?  Ugly people who like to shout across the computer lab about their social lives to equally ugly people.  Hicks is a good, stereotypical word for them, or maybe white trash.  They like to verbally abuse each other. Marten: Bob Barker?  The "Price is Right" guy?  You are so out of it. Thomas: Point taken. SQEE!
