Here's a kind-of-silly song parody -- just a chorus for now -- about the food and drink they give away at the "hospitality suites" before each interview.  "Do You Know The Way To Cookie Tray?" (to the tune of "Do You Know The Way To San Jose?")  Do you know the way to cookie tray? Classmates in suits all block the view that way. Chocolate-covered pretzels also good Though I had some before, I'll have some more.
