Also I was just reading today  urlLink  they found some stolen art behind a toilet.    All I have to say is WTF. I mean they were fricken watercolors. Jesus christ are criminals that dumb now a days!  Note (ray): They were in tube containers.. i freakin told Jerry it wasnt enough, he wouldnt listen. oh well, he wont rat me out.
