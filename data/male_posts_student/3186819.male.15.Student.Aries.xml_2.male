When she comes home she already got the things we were getting, but with JEFF. DAMN I AM REALLY STARTING TO DISLIKE THAT MAN! So I thought I was gonna decorate me bedroom tonight. WRONG. All items must first be approved by El President...i mean Comrade...i mean Fidel... I MEAN MOTHER. So congratulations boring life. Damn I can't wait until I see my pschyatrist!
