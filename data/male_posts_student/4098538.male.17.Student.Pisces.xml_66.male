We were both in a kind-of-stubborn quiet mood with each other for a while. But she just grabbed my hand and then everything was fine. It's such a nice place. I love it there. It makes me feel really small and makes me forget most of my problems. The only thing I don't like is the walk there because you have to pass a sewage place and it's well smelleh! Mandy was running around photographing stuff. I tried to act like I wasn't bothered but secretly, I found it incredibly cute. She went berry picking (for ages, might I add!). She got looooaaaadddds! Her mum made some kind of jelly with them. Then we went to Jilly's and it was nice, at first. Alcohol really boosts how strong my emotions are. I found myself just staring at Mandy and thinking how lucky I am to have her because I know she isn't happy with me a lot of the time, and I just find it amazing that she puts up with it. And while I was doing this, I started crying. I couldn't help it. I love her so much. I didn't tell Mandy why I was crying because she wouldn't have believed me - she would have said it was the alcohol talking or something. But from then on, I was in tears for practically the rest of the night. Once it started, I couldn't stop. Kinda silly now that I think back. After tearfully walking the streets, we got on a bus to my house. I felt really stupid and guilty for the way I had acted. But I think/hope she forgives me. I have been extra loving today because I want her to know how much she means to me. And I plan to be from now on. It isn't hard and it makes us both feel a lot better. But I can be extremely stubborn, as can Mandy. So that's why a lot of things don't get resolved for ages. Anyway, moving on. Mandy give me some really cool wireless headphone the other night. I only just got a cable I needed to work them today so I have had them on all day. It's great! I can listen to my music while I'm crapping! Yayyy! I just upload my 3000+ MP3's onto Winamp and put it on random. Niiiicceeee. My camera dock should be arriving tomorrow. That means I can use my camera more often because I won't have to keep buying batteries (the dock charges the batteries). I wanna go back to the place Mandy and I went to yesterday because I saw some things I'd love to snap. So, if my dock arrives, they will be uploaded onto my Flickr account ( urlLink www.flickr.com/photos/slow_chemical ) by Sunday night. I also added a forum onto my website ( urlLink www.blindedbyfear.esmartguy.com ) so I'd appreciate it if some of you guys could take a few minutes to register and post in the forum. It is generally a dumb-ass chat room type thingy. Check it out =) That's all I have to write about this evening. Night.
