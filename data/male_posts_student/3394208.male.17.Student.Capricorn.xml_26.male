I have surpassed my peers not in age, nor in any physical attribute, i have surpassed them in wisdom... i am young but i have lived my life as if i was born in my 20's and continued on... i have lived a life enough for 2 generations. although i am at peace with my state of being, it sometimes saddens me that i have not lived my age, that i had not had a chance to be a kid... the simplicity and naivety of a young boy's mind and heart for something... i've expierienced much... I am young, but my mind has surpassed juvenility.. i feel old, think to mature... it's sad to know that i can never ever regress... but progress...
