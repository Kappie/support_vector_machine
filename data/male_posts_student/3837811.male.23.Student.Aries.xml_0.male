Except the part where i see the kids.. lol  Lets start with the morning, i was supposed to step out of my house at 630am, but woke up at 635am..lol... Oh well, so i had to rushed to work by cab.. no choice. But, i got on the cab and i told the driver, Gan Eng Seng PRIMARY School.. Im sure i said PRIMARY coz i said it twice. Then the driver drove me to Gan Eng Seng SECONDARY School.  I told him, PRIMARY school leh. He shouted, "PRIMARY ar, aiya, u told me SECONDARY. " I retorted," I told you PRIMARY!" He said, "U said Primary meh?" I wanted to fucking punch his face, but i shouted angrily," NEVER MIND LAR! " Then he said nicely, "Never mind, primary school is down the road only, wont take up much of ur time." Fucking hell, one more from him, i will complain until his pants drop.  Ok, so i reached the school, saw my favourite group, i forgot about the matter already, lol.. Today GESPS had a carnival. Today is the actual day, where we see how the P5s will do presenting their bday party proposal and P4s selling their cookies. There is tis voting booth, for the parents to vote the best P5 group. So the teacher in charge asked my colleague to give out stickers for the parents to vote. My colleague was busy, i saw some groups not doing so well, so i, alone, ran around pushing and motivating the kids to drag parents to their presentation booth. And i was practically running around pushing them.  Then when i stepped out to the voting booth, my colleague push the box of stickers to me and said, "Your turn LAR, u only walk around only, i do tis for a very long time already." So i tot, FUCKER, i was running around and he said it like as if i doing nothing. But to avoid any quarrels, i said, "Ok lor, Never mind, I do lor." And the next ting he said, "I go walk around see see." VERY GOOD, first he said it as if i never do anyting, though i was running around, now he pushed the work to me and he go WALK WALK... Haiz, oh well... Since its the last day, watever then.. But shortly, the teacher in charge saw me really tired, so she asked one of the students to take over me and asked me to rest, at least someone appreciated me... But i cant rest, i saw the groups still not doing so well, i continued to push and motivate them.  Oh well, enough of that, lets go to the happy moments today.. took pictures of all the P5 groups, and before i can take pictures of the P4, their cookies were already sold out, so only managed to catch two groups to take pictures. One of the groups bugged me to buy their cookies, the moment they said "TEACHERRRR" my heart turned soft, LOL oh well so i emptied my wallet buying one pack of cookies from them. $4 and my wallet is empty, im TAT broke now.     My favourite P5 group. They jus cracked me up, especially the girl, Geraldine, on the extreme left      The winning P5 group. Em1 class, expected them to win...         The P4 group and their cookies, who and which, "declared" me bankrupt..   Haha, so the P5s were trying to force everybody to vote for their group, and it became like tis.....    Pasar Malam Style   After work, and i tot my day is over, finally, but someting happened again. As i was walking past the mac near my block, one fucker was playing the fucking soccer ball outside the Mac and he kicked the fucking ball to my shin. I was DAMN FUCKING PISSED OFF, i stopped, took off my earphones, stared at the fucker, heard his classmates laughing, i stared at those fuckers and they kept quiet. I stared back at the fucker, who tinks he is ryan giggs, and shouted in a guai lan voice, with a guai lan look (i called it the guai lan combo, lol), "Which school are you from?!" He whimpered,"Balestier." I stared at him one more time and walked off. *To my friend mel, can u feel the guai lan combo? lol"  Oh well, after tat finally reached home, and tat was about it, home is the only world tat does not piss me off. Great! lol   Current Mood: Pissed-off   Current Music: None
