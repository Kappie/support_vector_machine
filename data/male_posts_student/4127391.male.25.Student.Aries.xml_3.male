That's why a window comes up that says: "Are you sure you want to delete the  whole  blog?" And if you're thinking to yourself, "No dummy, I just want to delete five words of my blog," then think again. Because by  whole blog , it meant: whole blog.  I discovered that google cached my blog, which is nice.  I'm only going to resurrect my blog on why I chose the name "Saint Socrates" for this blog.  I've also added a link to that blog that leads you to a source which claims that Mel Gibson might make a movie called "The Death of Socrates."
