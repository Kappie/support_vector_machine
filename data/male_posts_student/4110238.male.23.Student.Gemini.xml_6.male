(felt irresponsible all day, except for the time i spent sleeping...)  braden!  you and your crazy drama dude!  i love it, even though my heart really does go out to you...that sucks man!  ridiculous gay soap operas!  was gonna see supersize me, but got there and it was sold out...damn alamo drafthouse!  damn dollar ticket night!  which brings us to...now...and that feeling...
