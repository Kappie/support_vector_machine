I like it!  Something I miss doing, that I only really do here at home is read the paper. A real physical copy of it anyway. It's something that just seems to work really well with breakfast or other meals. I'm not really a fan of the  urlLink OC Register  though. It always feels 2 days behind the internet, but it's nice having the sheets of paper laid out on the table infront of me as I eat my scrambled eggs, sausage, and hashbrowns. If I knew how to do it, I think it'd be cool to have a subscription to a UK paper, or even French one. I think though... when tablet PCs get to a really cheap and convienent form, that would really replace having a real newspaper.  So today I think I might call up a temp company to try to get a job and maybe join a gym. I think I also need some new summer clothes, but I hate clothing shopping.  ***
