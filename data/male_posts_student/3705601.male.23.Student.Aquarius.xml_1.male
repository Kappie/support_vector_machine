The night before, that I had completed my education and was extremely proud of it. Primus was in town and it was tapped to be a great show because of Les Claypool's mastery of the bass (something my friend, Big Masa and myself would really know how to appreciate). Our drummer friend Dave, from Vermont was with us, along with Chin (originally from Taiwan, but now Manchester, New Hampshire's very own).   As we entered the semi-outdoor venue (it was a giant tent, if I may call it that), I was excited to see what I did see. The smell of saltwater was in the air as we were very close to the sea. The show, scheduled to start at 8 PM, did start at 8 PM, give or take a few minutes. For the most part, there were a lot of kindred souls at the show. I saw hippies, yuppies, and regular stiffs there. I guess the diversity of the crowd was one of the things that made the show as special as possible. The other thing was vomit-man sitting in front of me. He was dancing like he was communing with evil, and he threw up. He was also pushing the buttons of the security personnel until the finally threw him out in the middle of the first act, much to the delight of those around me. I can now enjoy the show in peace (or whatever peace was in a concert).   To be perfectly honest, I am not aas highly into Primus as the other people in the show. I have only 2 Primus CDs and could not remeber the song titles to save my life. Fortunately, Primus is one of the bands that you do not really need to remember all the song titles because all the songs sounded so good and had a certain energy to them. The show was just incredible. The only thing I realized that wasn't right was that Les Claypool didn't talk to the audience as much as the other frontmen of the other concerts did. He only started talking to people in the crowd towards the end of the show. In a way, it throws us off because we did not have a clue what was going on. The show had come and gone and all we remember was how great it was, and how Les Claypool was really cool and how Tim "Herb" Alexander had an awesome drum solo (that I did not miss, mind you), and although I wasn't allowed to bring my camera in the show, I am able to remember all the happy moments that occurred on the night of June 23rd 2004 for more reasons than one. Primus was awesome!!!
