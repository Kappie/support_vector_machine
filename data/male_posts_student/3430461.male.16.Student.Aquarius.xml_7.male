To add to my pain and suffering, on the 25th of June I'm having half a toenail chopped off. But I might get crutches, which is cool. Yay. The almost unbearable pain could be a problem, but it's worth it for the crutches. I think. Oh well (and there I go and do it again).  I'd love to waffle on for lines and lines and pages and pages, but I'm just too bloody nackered.
