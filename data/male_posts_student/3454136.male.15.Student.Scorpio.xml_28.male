I hate my life! ARGGGGGG! And y do I have to play ahead!? Do I care what I'm gonna do the coming summer? I don't think I do! But they think that I should! I hate this, hate this, hate this! And u no what? This isn't as satisfying as I thought it'd be. Maybe it's cause I'm refraining from swearing too much... Still I think I'm calm now... No suicidal or homicidal urges anymore... *deep breath... Yup, I'm fine. Sry for this meaningless post about my stupid meaningless life! I'm gonna take my agitation out on DDR, just so my mom would stop staring at what I'm typing...  Anyhow, cya all... Have a nice life in case this is my last post and I kill myself soon...
