I woke up at 8.30, and bathed for 30 minutes! I finished just as about Pokemon finished. I read the New Sunday Times. It's quite cool! The designs and everything. More sections too. Coolies! Alright alright. Yes yes! I ate chee cheong fun! Then, I watched cartoons till 11.   I went online. And XC! He added me to his convo with WQ. WQ asking XC to go genting. XC said "ask KY la". I was so embarrassed, and I left the room quickly, because I don't want to see his answer. XC (the idiiot :P) added me back, and I saw "help me ask him". I was like so damn embarrassed that I didn't look at the chatroom for the rest of the time I was online (even though I stayed inside the conversation). I read the Neopian Times, then went off to eat lunch.  After eating lunch and watching Huan Zhu Ge Ge (~sings: wo shi yi ge gu nian!~), I went to Wendy's house to study for A-Maths. But alas! I never really did what I intended.  The first thing Wendy asked me to do is write in her autograph book, NEATLY. I am the first one to sign her book, so I fell honored. I wrote a bit about my bio, then carried on to write 3.5 pages of messages for her. I wrote about how much I appreciate her, about our friendship (and how it is more than that...don't get me wrong....how it is more than close friends, like becoming sisters and brothers.) and a lot of things. I even wrote her a poem. HaHa! Then, she went on to "decorate" my autograph, making smudges beautiful and all that stuff ar. HaHa!   After that, I studied A-Maths until Chapter 5. HaHa! We were distracted and all. We keep talking. About friends. About our past. About our future. Yeah. In the end, we gave up studying altogether.  We went out to boil hot dogs to eat. HaHa! We took out one before water boiled. We found out that it was too hard. So, we boiled the hotdogs till the water boiled. Wendy then came up with this idea of baking cake together. We are so excited about it, and want to do it tomorrow one. But on Monday her father is off from work. Darn. so, we are seeing if Tuesday can bake cake or not! I am so excited! I wanna bake a cake! And oh, if you are wondering, the hot dogs taste nice!  We then went out to eat dinner. Three of us ate chicken rice. I brought back Chicken Chop for brother to eat. $4.50! Oh god! So darn ex! There goes the $7 Mom gave me! I everytime return her change one leh. Like the least $1 she gets back. Now, no change. So...don't know what to say la.  After I came home and bathed, I went off somewhere. Then, coming back, WQ messaged me! He asked me whether to go Genting or not! My heart skipped a beat! Oh god! I can't believe it! I can't believe he's talking to me. I asked Wendy for advice, but she said "You cannot depend on me all the time you know!. I told WQ I haven't made up my mind yet, I need more details. He gave everything to me.....and soon, talking leads to normal conversation. I am glad we finally talked. After so many months. Hm.  Okay. XC read my blog and found out that I am a witch. At first, he was like saying I joined a cult or something. He doesn't know what if witchcraft ma. I pointed him to a Wicca website, and answered a lot of his questions. I think he's basically okay with Wicca la (Are you, XC? HAHA). I am so glad I handled the situation quite well, and it didn't lead to major finger-pointing about Wiccans (which XC called Wiccist at first! haha!) being evil and all (I read people's stories about friends turning nasty on them when found out about their religion....quite scary you know). Hm. I was quite scared and nervous you know, when he asked about Wicca. I thought it would turn out ugly. Luckily, it didn't lor.   HaHa! Okay, I gotta go now. Waiting for Wendy to send something over so I can print it for her. Okay. See ya tomorrow. Goodnight blog.
