The Life of David Gale officially rates second last on my list of all time worst movies, still miles ahead of The Skulls as that last movie slot has to always be reserved for something actually seen on the big screen.  About 15 mins in I said to my friend a big Kevin Spacey friend I surmised to my friend (who'd allready seen it) the entire plot.  Now I'm not the person who gloats for being right and hence smart or something, no I like being wrong.  Anyways for it showing it's hand in a predictable fashion this movie blows.  Now check this insanity: in Olympics past, female atheletes have been known to get pregnant leading up to the competition as the increse in hormones is said to help with performance.  After which they'd promptly abort.  I shake my head and am glad to have never known anyone so depraved.
