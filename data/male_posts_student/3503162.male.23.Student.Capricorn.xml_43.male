Ate breakfast at 11ish, some weetbix which I havent had for awhile, got to try it tomorrow as well. Warcrafted till the arvo when I decided to fax in my resume for this job. Was waiting at the library for the fax to go through. Waited 40mins which I spent just walking around the library to find out it diddn't work. Oh well that sucked.  Got home at this strawberry-filling sponge cake. Was alright but kinda mushy inside. Cant remember what happened afterwards, must had been one of those mindless periods of the day I frequently experience. Dinner was some rice and battered fish. Now im on the intraweb chatting and (was) playing trivia.     The End.
