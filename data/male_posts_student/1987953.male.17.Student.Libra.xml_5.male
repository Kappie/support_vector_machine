Well, I never had trash say "Open Immediately." The curiosity in me made me open it. What I saw when I opened it was a bomb threat to the school. It read, "There is a bomb in the school. It will go off at 11:30. It will be funny to watch you die." After I read it, and went through two periods, I turned it in. The principal, Mr. Schmitz, called me to his office to ask me questions about it. He evacuated the school entirely for almost an hour, from 11:05-11:45 to make sure there was no bomb. It was in fact, a prank, as I knew the whole time. To make sure I was right in the situation, I turned it in anyway. A letter was sent to all the parents of all the students detailing the situation, including all the measures they went through to protect the students and to draw leads as to who wrote the note, and the drastic punishments to the perpetrators. It was kind of embarrassing, but I am glad I did the right thing. What a day, huh? I promise to start writing more.  In Christ, Mike  "Then He said to them all, 'If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. '" -Luke 9:23 NIV
