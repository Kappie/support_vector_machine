Im just listening to Media Player, and the stupid song sung by that stupid (and yet cringingly cute) Pokemon Jigglypuff came on. It disturbs me, that wee balloon resemblin bastard. MAIR LIKE GIGGLYPOOF!  Heehee - listen to me talk. I'm a funny lesbian - OOH IM ELLEN! HAHAHAHAHAAA!! Sorry, heehee, am really quite hyper right now. Possibly coz im knackered and upset!   YAY!  Well today was very eventful. Went to Edinburgh to see "Crazy For You", this George Gershwin musical or summit. Was okay. Matanees - never the best performances (this of course coming from a Mr Sluttykins-Thespian, the Californian stage-gerbil). Choreography was astounding, and ive obviously now realised that im gonna have to add Tap to my repetoire for next year (more on that later).  Anywayz, on the way there it was a bit of a boring trip. We got the backseats, as per usual, while the wee third year shites had to stay down the front. I swear to God they fucked so many people off tonight. They got Maltesers squashed into their bus seats (busdriver threw one hell of a maddy!), talked through the whole thing, and one of them (who i soooo hate - cheeky wee bitch) actually spent half an hour texting in the middle of the performance. Bloody bloody cheek!  I think that pisses me off more coz i respect performers for how much work they put into these things. I know how much it would fuck me off if i was performing and i spotted someone doin that. Cow.  Anywayz...wee shites...moving on.  On the way back, however...  Ive never had so much fun with a tampon. Apparently i was at my comedic best, tampons and Rear of the Year jokes abound. Even impressed Fourth Year Sarah, who i wasnt sure liked me before. But we were roaring with laffter all the way home, even singing the song from that Irn Bru advert. You know:  Everybody in the world loves Irn Bru I Do I Do I Do Me Too  Everybody in the world loves Irn Bru Who does? He does She does Me does  And i especially love Irn Bru, even though i used to be a man...even though i used to be a MAAAAAAAN!!!  alala...heehee
