Since Thursday (the London trip) I have been mainly dividing up my time with using the computer ( urlLink Neopets  chat boards, browsing the  urlLink Nationstates  fora and reading articles on  urlLink Everything2 , which is actually quite interesting), sleeping, playing chess, and reading. Well, it's not all for nothing, as I managed to finish The Fellowship of the Ring this morning, which was quite an achievement. Only 2 weeks after I started it, so in pretty good time. Could have been faster though.  Yeserday I watched 'Return of the King' DVD, even though I've watched it at least three times before. A good film though; it kills over three hours of the day too.  And that's about all of my daily happenings. And I have 6 more weeks untill school starts again. Now, don't get me wrong, I love my summer holidays, and would much rather be at home than be at school, although... well, school does make something to do. And I am slightly looking forward to sixth form. It should be quite good (remind me to read this again when I start and see if I thought correct), only the 4 subjects that I actually enjoy... no essay writing... (hopefully) becomming a prefect... I think I'll enjoy next year more than any other year at school. Wow... it seems such a short time ago I was leaving my old school, finishing year 6 (Best not say what school it was; internet safety and stuff) and starting my current school. That was 5 years ago. My God, time really does fly. *At this point he remembers his old form and idiot-of-a-form tutor, and those once weekly lessons in the library.* Those were the days... the only thing to worry about being if you did your homework neatly (or at all, if you're  urlLink dickybod ) And now 5 years later I've done my GCSEs and ready for sixth form. Anywho, enough reminiscing, back to the boring life of your friend dave.  So, recent films I have watched. Firstly, '10 Things I Hate About You', which was on last night. 'Twas ok, but still just a classic American high school romance comedy type. And also, this afternoon I watched 'Thunderbirds Are Go', from the 1960s, which wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but alright.  I'll probably arrange another sort of outing with the duds to keep myself occupied in the comming days. Maybe the cinema. Or something else.  Bye for now   Weather:  Sunny most of today, a bit cloudy in the afternoon  Reading:  The Two Towers, Eats, Shoots and Leaves  Listening to:  Monty Python CD - Every Sperm is Sacred  Watching:  10 Things I Hate About You, Thunderbirds Are Go  Confused about:  The Speed of Time...  Annoyed with:  Not really  Mood:  Reminiscing
