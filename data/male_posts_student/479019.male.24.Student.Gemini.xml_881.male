I was just thinking about  urlLink Esther 's little story about how she won't give a guy a second date, because he listens to Dashboard Confessionals. I laughed and jokingly called her an indie snob. It's a funny story, but I think this is an example of the importance of subculture in regards to identity. I think that for the most part, if a girl didn't have similar tastes in music... it would be highly unlikely that I'd be attract to her. (Unlikely, but not impossible.) The reason for this is that music for the most part is what subcultural lines are drawn around and when it comes down to chosing someone to date, you want someone that you have stuff in common with.  Anyway so I asked Esther which she'd rather date - a moderate Republican or someone that listens to N*Sync. She chose the Republican, because she thought that political debates might be fun. I found that funny, so I posed the question to  urlLink Becky  and  urlLink Crystal  and they both said they'd choose the N*Sync guy. I guess for them, politics (which is subcultural as well) overrided musical tastes. I think for me, I'm with Esther on that question. I really enjoy good political debates, or friendly debates over whatever. I think that keeps you on your toes, and I think a good partner should do that. My opinion is that someone who is too much the same as you is scary. However, a moderate Republican is a big difference from those Bible-thumping militaristic conservatives that control Bush... that's a Republican I wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole.  In regards to race... I doesn't matter, but I think that the comments of certain people come across strange. For example,  urlLink Laine  (who's Asian) has joked on several occasions that I seem to only date / like Asians. I don't know, about that... but that's somewhat in a similar vein as Nick's "go interracial relationships!" comment (he's white). I don't like the whole specifically choosing someone to date based on race thing, because it comes across as creepy and these things always have racial-gender biases. For example my buddy Stephanie (an Asian) has always made it pretty well known that she doesn't date Asian guys. I don't know how to feel about comments like that whenever she makes them in my prescence, because I always think about the social construction of race and gender for Asian males. See M. Butterfly by David Henry Hwang or the  Details  magazine and Whitney McNally's article "Gay or Asian?"   However, going full circle, how many Asians like the things that my friends and I like? If subculture and music are important attributes for attraction to the opposite sex, and very few Asians like punk, indie rock, leftist politics, history, sociology, etc. then it complicates things more.  ***
