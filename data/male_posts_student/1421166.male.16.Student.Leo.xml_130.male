This is needed especially since I have forgotten some of its content during my previous entry. Furthermore, to produce such a statement against an authority in English Language would be as good as throwing an egg against a rock. Thus, I am quite sure I have missed out on some of his context. Unfortunately, this will only be done when I'm free to think about it.  However, the views I expressed is very much my ideas and also possibly influenced by my own readings which might include C.S. Lewis himself. Anyway, I sincerely feel that C.S. Lewis is a great author.
