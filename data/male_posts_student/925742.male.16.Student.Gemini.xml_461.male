Life it seems, will fade away Drifting further every day Getting lost within myself Nothing matters no one else I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give There is nothing more for me Need the end to set me free  Things are not what they used to be Missing one inside of me Deathly lost, this can?t be real Cannot stand this hell I feel Emptiness is filling me To the point of agony Growing darkness taking dawn I was me, but now he?s gone  No one but me can save myself, but it?s too late Now I can?t think, think why I should even try  Yesterday seems as though it never existed Death greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye   Fade to Black, by Metallica, good song.  Why do I associate my tender feelings with metal bands?  Could it be because they're as good as any other music for expressing whatever you're feeling at the moment?  Yeah, I think so, too.  And in case you're wondering, the tears are gone, now.
