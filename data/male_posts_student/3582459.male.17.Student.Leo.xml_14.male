In 6th, 7th, and 8th grades, we read a lot of nice little adventure books like  Julie of the Wolves  that had no real literary or philosophical value. I would much rather we have done a survey of western philosophy and literature instead. Granted, middle schoolers may not understand many of the ideas presented in, for example, the Enlightenment, but exposure to those ideas is valuable in and of itself.  Social studies should be taught in a way that doesn't focus in specific events, but rather focuses on major movements in history, with events and dates only used to illustrate the major movements. Literature read in English should correspond to the movements being studied in social studies. Music and art taught should strive to be representative of the various eras.  Basically, I would structure the middle school years around the writers of the great eras of western civilization: classical western civilization--basically the Greeks and Romans (Aristotle, Plato, Homer, Vergil, St. Augustine); the Renaissance and the Enlightenment (St. Thomas Aquinas, Shakespeare, Sir Thomas More, Immanuel Kant, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Hobbes, Adam Smith, Jonathan Swift); modernity and post-modernity (Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, Michel Foucault, T.S. Eliot, e.e. cummings, Leo Tolstoy). I'd also throw in a survey of American civilization, too, including Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain), Edgar Allen Poe, Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Paine, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Upton Sinclair. If the public school system allows it, some of the Bible (completely in a historical, cultural context) would be good too, as western civilization is pretty firmly rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition.   That's a lot of authors--29 not counting the Bible--but students wouldn't need to read full books by all of them; most of the above authors wrote excellent short stories, poems, and essays. I would recommend reading 2-3 full books in 6th grade, 4-5 full books in 7th grade, and 5-6 full books in 8th grade.   Students in middle school should also be exposed to the eras of western civilization by looking at representative art and listening to representative music from each particular era.   What would giving all students such a broad and liberal education in western civilization do? Aside from being intrinsically valuable, liberal education pushes students to think logically and creatively, and gives them the tools to argue effectively. Liberally educated students are better able to synthesize together ideas from history into wholly new ideas and arguments. Also, it's pretty cool to be able to quote St. Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant when talking.   Let's dispense with  Julie of the Wolves  and teach our middle schoolers about the foundations of the western civilization they live in.
