Brandon is right, that Del Taco on Irvine Blvd. likes to screw up orders late at night.  I'm opting against the show night, because it's $20 at the door. A wee bit pricey for my tastes. Perhaps I shall hang out with other friends instead tonight. Sorry Crystal.  I need to go to the UCI library today.  **
