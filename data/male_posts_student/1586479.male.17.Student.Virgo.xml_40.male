(my own dumb fault) My faith in the kindness of strangers was reaffirmed.  Yeah, my car was acting screwy all day. Then it stopped acting screwing and, well....stopped. Next to a bunch of condos on Colony Rd. I sat there, called Katy for a ride (who by the way is a wonderful friend), and while I was sitting, a nice older guy came out and asked if I was alright. I explained that my car didn't go and he checked it out. apparently I was out of coolant and the guy happened to have some. He filled it up, but it still didn't start. So when Katy got there we pushed the car back into a parking lot. Then the guy suggested that I use his gas can and go get some gas. Katy drove us to the gas station, got some gas, filled my truck and, uh, it started. So cool. I thought my car broke, but it didn't. So yeah.  It was the kindness of that guy that was so cool. A complete stranger offering to help. He didn't even accept money for the coolant. Random acts of kindness are great.  In DC there is a George Bush Center for Intelligence. Heh.  *poof*
