I hate how they look, the constant raquet they make, I hate how they are crappy fliers, I hate how they smell, and I espeacially hate how they keep getting into my room.  Michael, your mom woukld go crazy at our house.  We've got cicadas out our butts.  I hate living in the woods. I want to STUFF the CICADAS! with lead!
