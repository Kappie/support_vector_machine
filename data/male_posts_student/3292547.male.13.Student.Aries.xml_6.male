Because of that, I've chosen to discontinue my webpage ( urlLink www.goatsmilk.tk )and just have the pictures of my cat that it was originally. Only it's not the best in the world.  Well, I gotta go to sleep now. It's getting late. Also, the border around the smilies is still there. I'm still working on it. Well. Bye.
