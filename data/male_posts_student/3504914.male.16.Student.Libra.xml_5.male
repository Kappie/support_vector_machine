As he held her fragile hand, his warm tears ran silently down his face, splashed onto her face, and roused her from her slumber. She looked up and her pale lips began to move slightly. "My darling John," she whispered.  "Hush, my love," he said. "Go back to sleep. Shhh. Don't talk."  But she was insistent. "John," she said in her tired voice. "I have to talk. I have something I must confess to you."  "There's nothing to confess," replied the weeping John. "It's all right.  Everything's all right, go to sleep now."  "No, no. I must die in peace, John. I slept with your brother, your best friend and your father."  John mustered a pained smile and stroked her hand. "Hush now Becky, don't torment yourself. I know all about it." he said, "Why do you think I poisoned you?"   Rambles: Sorry, i've been bored and busy xD So instead of making my usual quality posts, i'll just insert a character I made recently.   Charon The Mad Man:   Name: Charon, sometimes Mr. Jovial  Age: Eighteen Gender: Male Race: Habarian    Class: Psychopath/Mass Murderer    Facial Description: What made Charon such a successful pickpocket was his face, for he possessed a visage which was truly run of the mill. There is nothing extravagant on it, no moles, no freckles, just the coarse remains of a man built by hardship. Charon’s hair is a dull green which could pass for dark brown under the right lighting,  and his eyes are of Habarian traits, meaning they possess a gold tint to them, and his teeth are just average. Never once has Charon shaved, and so a thickened beard runs around his face.         Clothing Description: Charon’s choice in garments is simple and effectively helps him blend in with the crowd. His pants are made of rough browned cotton, and his jacket is of tanned leather, sewn so badly it’s unfeasible to think anybody would pay for it. Charon, however, did not pay for it, so it’s alright. For shoes, he uses leather as well, but though these are well-made, the soles are coming off and the flaps are unhinging. The socks under this formerly elegant piece of footwear are tattered in so many places it seems impossible for the socks to hold together.    Weapons: Charon has always made due with the world around him, and has been reputed to kill people with a numerous range of weapons, from a dead fish to a wooden spoon. He is no professional killer, and he is no assassin, and due to the anarchic rule of Habar, he never needs to clean up his messes. Everything he has used, he has learned to use on the spot, and while some require more improvisation than others (Charon had once killed somebody with a single small cube of ice), Charon feels that a weapon is a weapon and therefore its purpose is to kill and the method on how to do it is always there, waiting to be discovered.   History: Charon was born into the world a murderer, responsible for killing his own mother within the first minute of his life. His father, a negligent alcoholic, dropped Charon as he carried him in his arms a day after his birth. Not only had Charon been born to a drunkard and a dead woman, he had been born a bastard child, for neither of the two had ever been married.   Charon was in the care of his father for nearly two years before the man traded him for a pint of beer, not realising what he was doing. The bartender, knowing he could get a hefty price off of Charon by selling him as a slave, went to the black market and did just that. Once again, Charon traded hands, this time to a homosexual paedophile named Bill.   Bill was a politician of high standings in Habar, the city which was the exact anti-thesis to utopia. He preferred his boys to be at least four before he molested them, and he would regret that with Charon. For day by day for two years, he messed with Charon’s genitals, pretending he was playing a game with Charon. What he didn’t know was that Charon, though a child, knew what the fifty year old professional liar was up to, even though he didn’t know the word for it.  When the day finally came, and Bill entered his room at night, Charon brought down a knife he had stole from the kitchen upon Bill’s cock. While Bill cried in pain, Charon swung again and again, mutilating everything from Bill’s face to his legs. Nobody paid any attention, for they heard screaming, confronted murder and thievery every day. Who cared? Charon ran from the house, clothed in an oversized jacket he had stolen from the old man’s closet, and ran until he could run no longer. He passed out after three days of aimless wandering, from dehydration.   When he awoke, Charon found himself tied to a bed, with a syringe sticking out of his arm. Connected to it was tubing, which itself led to a plastic bottle containing what seemed to be blood. Charon screamed. To his side came a man and a girl, the man looking around thirty, and the girl in her late fifteens. Both had dilated eyes, seeping eye-bags, and translucent skin. The girl was first to speak, introducing herself as Rachel, and even introducing the guy as Ox. They told Charon of how they had found him on the street, covered in blood, and how they would take care of him now.   Charon lived with these people for scarcely three years, before losing his mind when he heard them talking about selling him, Charon, to buy some more of the devil powder which they snorted after and before every love session. Ox had been surprising easy, for despite his big bulk, his veins protruded, and the wire Charon had removed from the bed had cut through the neck veins easily. Rachel was in some other mental plane when Charon took her out, and she had been easier still, pleasuring herself with her dirty fingers, hiding her privates under a holy book as if God could not see what she was doing. Neither had very much money on them, and at seven Charon couldn’t exactly earn a living in the city.    Thievery became his game, and Charon was a magnificent player. But his life maintained its inconsistency, and he mistakenly picked the pocket of a cult leader called Simon. This man was becoming increasingly powerful in the city, and his control over his followers using various narcotics and alcohols combined together disallowed any competition from rising within his sect, named the Asylum of God’s Children. In an instant after Charon’s hand reached behind the man’s serape, two bulky, brainless goons were on him, and Charon received many a blow to the guts before passing out.   When Charon awoke, he was in the Asylum itself, a former cathedral with windows that had been shattered by one of the many thousands of riots that had stormed by here before. He was tied by his feet, hanging upside down, and he could feel the blood rushing to his head. Simon the Minister stood before him, his black fancy wig crawling down his back like a snake. Simon offered Charon a proposal, one which involved Charon become a cultist. The deal was this. Charon was to become a pamphlet boy, in charge of handing out leaflets regarding the Asylum, and picking the pockets of all those who refused. This way, the sect could gain money from its non-believers as well as the currency it took from its own members. In return, Charon would get free lodgings and not be killed.   Charon had, by now, gotten far more than a taste for what life was like, and he accepted the deal, no questions asked. Years passed, and by the time he was twelve, he was much higher in position than a pamphlet distributor, and served as a right-hand man to Simon himself. To be highest on the food chain was Charon’s goal, and one night he slipped powder into the wine of the Minister, a powder which disabled the vocal chords from working as well as functioning as a tranquiliser. Simon was fully conscious when Charon began carving open his ribcage, and yet he could not scream out loud.   Charon escaped the Asylum before the cult found their leader dead, and though they vowed vengeance, they fell into disarray with nobody to lead them. It was by chance that a month later, as Charon went from inn to inn, hiring himself off as a gigolo, he met his father. Despite being at such a young age when he had last seen him, Charon knew who it was well enough, but questioned him on his life nevertheless.  The man was still a fucking drunk. Charon brought him outside the pub, and killed him with his own hands, savouring each tooth that fell out of his old man’s mouth. The next day, Charon sold his father’s corpse for beer money, it was only fair.   Now, years later, Charon is eighteen, and has killed at least twenty men, seven women, and three children. He suffers from a number of mental disorders, schizophrenia and psychosis being two of many. He is unemployed, and makes all his money off of his victims. On an end note, Charon rarely makes any sense when he talks.
