Last summer I was blessed with two jobs, and when I was laid off of one, I laughed as it happened. Well my friends, karma is a bitch because thus far I am unemployed and have been that way for about 4 months now. While I'm certainly sitting comfortable with enough to pay for my tuition next year and rent as well, it just seems so weird to have all this time on my hands and a lack of an incoming monetary source.   Most of the day was spent inheriting a tonne of stress, which I really don't need. Things were looking good during the border crossing to the Moneen show. Upon arrival, no names were on the guestlist and the show was sold out. A sold out Moneen show in Detroit was certainly a shocker considering the show they played last month was poorly attended and the few crowd members were really getting into their music. Regardless, these events were probably for the best so I can't be too mad about the outcome. It still would have been nice to see those young men from Brampton headline a show tonight.  As a nice surprise, when I got home I found out that my Numbers/Les Georges Lenningrad/The Sick Lipstick poster by SeriPop had arrived in the mail. So I look forward to getting it framed tomorrow and hanging it on my wall because this apartment definitely needs some wall decorations.  "my soul is weak / my eyes are blind / my father drove me on / it's nothing more than dust and ash / the day my friend was gone.
