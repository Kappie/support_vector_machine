It wouldn't be out of place if they had called named it with this above title.  Basically what this issue does is to give a detailed introducing to the world of using computers to not only record but also to create, mix, produce and even master music for personal use. In most cases the stuff done can also be applied to professional studios as well.  Now as I have mentioned before ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ), at the start of the year I had taken up to learn more about computer music as an extension of my duties as a sound engineer, to find ways to improve or booster the sound equipment in Church and for personal enrichment as well.  But things have not been working out as well as I have figured, there are tons of information that need to be understood and compiled from many sources, too many choices in hardware and software and most things assume knowledge in music playing and theory of which I have…well…none. It’s all very disheartening. It also doesn’t help that all the solutions that I discovered to help out in Church is mainly only possible with a sizeable budget, of which I have none.  So I have not been keeping up to date on the scene much with school and such keeping me occupied. But I guess with this issue a fresh start can be taken. Perhaps I shouldn’t rush headlong into trying to figure out the higher end stuff and perhaps start slow towards the low end first. I am taking some basic music theory courses and so that would hopefully arm me with greater know-how to make better use of my MIDI keyboard instead of just banging away at it.  Basically it comes down to making the most of what I have at the moment and not worry too much about other stuff. These things take time and so I just have to stick to it and then I’ll slowly see the benefits as I build up my foundations.
