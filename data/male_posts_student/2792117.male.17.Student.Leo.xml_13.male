Haiz, me n my fren intended 2 stay back in class aft sch n do our compo which has to be submitted tml one, then while doin our wrk, a grp of sec.1s wif their chio-bu teacher walked past my class, then 1 sec 1 said tt we nv do wrk so kana punished by having to do the wrk aft sch...haiz,... sec 1ss r simply ignorant... cant blame them also. but at least stayed in class got chio bu to c, not tt bad aft all~~ Aft doin halfway, my fren hav to go, n so i leave e class aft doin my wrk halfway lor. Then wanted to go toilet one, but 2nd floor locked, n so hav to go 1st floor, stupid Om always like to lock up 2nd floor onwards toilet one.... damm.
