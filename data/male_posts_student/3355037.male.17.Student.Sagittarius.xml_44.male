Yeah, he entered, because both the Poker Guru and Derek were both out quite early and around the same time too. Wait. Maybe that was a different night? I don't know anymore, summer is becoming too monotonous to remember exact dates.  But back to the tournament. After they both went out, I still played on. After a while, the Poker Guru asks me how I am doing and then decides to watch my table while I play. Eventually I made it to first intermission, 55 minutes into the tournament. The Poker Guru was quite impressed that I had once again reached his very first goal for me. Midway between the first and second intermissions, he started to help me on decisions with what hands to play. Now some of you may accuse me of cheating this way, but I have not taken credit for my final place. I made it past second intermission and this is where I entered that other post. I can't remember if there was a third intermission or not, though I think there was one, because I was up until about 3:30 playing poker and there is an intermission every 55 minutes. Do the math... and yes, there should've been a third intermission. Eventually I made it to the final table of the last 10 people of the 999 original entrants. I was among them. After quite a few ups and downs, I made 4th place. That's right. I didn't stutter. 4th place... Needless to say, I was happy. But as stated earlier, I did not make it this far on my own. Without the Poker Guru, I doubt that I would even have made it in the money. So for that, Mr. Guru, I am grateful. Thank you.   On a final note, I'd like to say that I am sorry for any doubt that I may have had for the Karl. I went all in quite a few times pre-flop with a Karl, and not once did it fail me. More poker awaits me...
