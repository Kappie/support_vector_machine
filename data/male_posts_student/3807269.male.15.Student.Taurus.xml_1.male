I run Windows XP on a secondary partition on my laptop. I use it at work, and get just enough time in it to realize how stupid it is! Seriously! I'm not even talking about the coding aspects of the operating system. I'm talking about the totally rediculous everyday stupidities in this program we all use at one point or another.    Windows XP, the windows "XP-erience". Come with me and I'll show you memories from my Windows experiences.                      Let's jump right in, shall we? We begin our Microsoft Windows XP-erience by logging on and getting to the desktop. Wow, what a beautiful background Micrososft gave us! My mouth dropps open as I gasp at it's beauty! I haven't seen a hill like this since Teletubbies! This looks like the kind of wallpaper *I* want to use. I'm really glad Microsoft chose such a professional looking default wallpaper for their newest operating system.                              Who can resist those incredible color schemes! Blue, white, red, and green - colors this vivid are rarely seen outside of Toys'R'Us! Leave it to Microsoft to create a professional looking (but somehow 'fitting') color scheme for their wonderful new lines of operating systems. Uhoh, take a look at the height of the default window decorations. I want to find the complete moron who thought up THAT idea. "Maybe if we make the title bar 25px high, it'll be a completely usesless waste of space and make our OS look a lot more childlike".                              Ok, the default windows background sucks BIG TIME. Let's take a look at out alternatives! Upon a quick inspection, you'll find a plethora of ghastly wallpapers that you can use for your system! They're 100% free too! Now you can pick between bubbles, bricks, pink swirles, or greyish brown chinese fans! (pictured here)                              Open up any folder or drive in the windows explorer window and selec help. One of the options you'll see is "Is this copy of Windows legal?". You can follow the steps to see if your version of Windows is legitimate. If it is, you're a retard.                              I don't know about you, but I feel the windows XP icon sets are an insult ot my intelligence. However, let's take a closer look:         topleft - (display settings) what's with the paint?         topright - (hardware) who the heck has a combo. printer/mouse?         midleft - (sound) a golfclub a suction cup. big deal         midright - (users) oh yeah, that looks mature.         botleft - (space) wow, that looks like my 2nd grade math book         botright - (date) who has a callendar with 14 days on it?                              In the find dialogues, you always get incredibly helpful little assistants that watch you while you search. No one really knows what they do. But becide taking up cpu you could be using to quicken your search, that processing power is put into animating these incredibly professional looking 3d assistants.                               Let's say I want to switch users. Cool.            Q: How do I switch users without logging off?            A: Click LogOff , then "Switch User"                               we're back to wallpapers! My my, look at these beauties that Microsoft hid from the world by stashing it in the "my pictures" folder. Who the heck uses the "my pictures" folder anyway? I want to see the person who got these pictures. They're too high contrast to use as wallpapers! crazyness!                              Ok, I know you've all XP-erienced it. You go to copy a file, it gets tou bout 99% complete then it says you have a GAZILLION minutes remaining in your file transfer. Anyone know what causes this? It's been happening since windows 95. And *no* one seems to be able to fix it.                               Let's take a quick look at the new screensavers that windows xp provides us after it's 200$ pricetag!            wha... what? Only one new screen saver? oh man, it must be SWEET!            ::blink:: That's the screensaver? Wow, imagine the coding behind that one.                               Windows XP supports the NTFS filesystem. I personally have lost about 6 gigs of data (Japanese Mp3s) using NTFS when the power went out. Apparently, NTFS has a "slight drawback" in the sense that if power to the hard drive is cut while it's writing to the disk, data loss occurrs. It can sometimes fix it at boot, but sometimes fails or just doesn't see the problem at all. For XP, I use the FAT filesystem. However I think it's funny. This bloated filesystem that's so big and clunky is named FAT!                               I could write an entire page about the stupidities of internet Explorer.            So you load a wallpaper or big image and - oops! it's stretched so it doesn't run off the page. It's not anti aliased and it looks horrible            you can fix the image by hoving off the image, hovering back on, waiting 4 seconds, and clicking the bottom right of the image. What a stupid thing to do! If you're going to include image resizing, make it anti alised, and make it so clicking the image will size it back to purportion. Mozilla's Firebird browser has this feature just right.                                So you want to shut down your computer.            Great.            Just wait 10 or 15 seconds for your processor to crank out 20 fullscreen bitmaps slowly fading your current desktop to black and white. Why do you want the fade? no clue. Why do we want black and white in the first place?!                                You should be a good person and update Windows regularly.            Why?            BECAUSE WINDOWS SUCKS.            Read the updates (for once). It's discusting how bad these 'mild problems' are that Windows Update fixes really are.                               Windows XP supports Windows Media Player 9! WOW! I'll bet Windows Media Player 9 is packed with TONS of really cool features! Just take a look at the Media guide! Well, you don't have a choice. It loads automatically every time you load the player. It takes 10-15 seconds to load because of it too. But something that takes that long to load must be a killer media guide! Just look how informative the text is! And observe how beautifully it fits inside the player with minimal scrolling.                                 We all know how to get to Windows Update - but what the heck is the "windows catalog" and who has ever clicked that icon? Anyone?                              A microsoft employee must have been pretty gosh darn bored out of his mind to put Volume Control under the Entertainment section.
