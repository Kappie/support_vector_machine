One was to try to cause no harm to others, verbally or physically, and in this, I failed with the damn slip of my tongue in regards to Zio xD Sorry man. The other was to something good in those I saw and did not particularly fancy. This I accomplished. Therefore, I am not so much in regret that I failed one, because I managed to achieve the other. This may seem a bit silly, but you cannot build a world in a day, and you will naturally fail at some things, but you can always learn. Moreover, I intend to xD   Well apart from this, I have to thank Murti for the interesting conversation. I had just been arguing with Krys about clubbing, and I was somewhat irritated at how she seemed to perceive my arguments. No doubt, I was at fault, but her dispute made little sense to me. I will put out some of the strange highlights I found… Bemusing?   Her: people are the ones that give the club a bad name Me: oh great, people are the ones who give the club a bad name, quality argument that... You're saying if all the wrong people were not to go clubbing then it would be alright, thats like saying war is fine if the soldiers don't attend Her: exactly. there wouldn't even be war if not for the soldiers    Now, here I was rather speechless. She seemed to be agreeing with me, but disagreeing at the same time x( Makes me a sad Dammo.   Her: i don't think most ppl indulge in reading books or writing stories as having fun Me: *shrugs* But then again, reading books and writing stories doesn't exactly promote a negative lifestyle does it  Her: its not negative, but its not that positive either Me: Its positive for the writer because they're releasing their creativity, its positive for the reader because they're learning things Her: look, i see clubn as FUN cuz i get to hang with my friends and ya know have fun with them if you think i indulge in clubn due to sex, drinks, and drugs whatsoever, well then ur terribly wrong der haha people can be influenced by books did you know certain books are just like watching tv they can poison ur minds Me: right, so your argument is that certain books poison the mind correct? now, certain clubs poison the body and the mind Her: I mean i love books, i love readin them...but at times i wanna just relax and have fun Me: It just so happens the percentage of which these clubs pollute people is high Her: haha it does not poison the body and mind stupid Me: I'm sure there's some decent club Her: it just depends on the person like moi, i haven't been drunk once i haven't taken drugs ever Me: Ha right right, then I can say the same  It depends on the person who's reading the book  Honestly, I don’t like arguing with most people, because there is some reluctance in trying to argue from the neutral standpoint. Trust me, I try to stay as hard as I can to not be a kill joy, but when you look at it from the perspective of some person who has just entered into our civilization for the first time, you notice that a lot of stuff we do is horrid for us, and we don’t notice it because of the positive aspects. Thing is, these positive points can usually be found without the negative.   Ah well xD To each their own, I’m trying to hard to accept this.  Notes on the Post Title: I really want to find the book, written by Adlous Huxley I think
