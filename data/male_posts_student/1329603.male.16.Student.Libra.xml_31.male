I'm absolutely terrified of myself, how I'm going to turn out. I have massive angry stages like that, one of which I broke my foot in, the other I scared my entire family. My dad almost killed me with one of his fits. I don't... I don't want to turn into him. I want to not worry that any time someone makes me angry that I might actually KILL them. And I mean literally strangle/stab them. Seriously.  I should delete that post, but I'm not going to. Why? I'm not sure. It's a part of my life now, and however much it may seem so, rubbing it off isn't going to help matters. The words will still stick, the pain will stay... this is MY LIFE. Screwed, isn't it?  And by the way Patrick, this isn't something to be proud of. This was me going psycho and you shouldn't say that I managed to do what you couldn't because that's not the point. The point is you managed to not go mental and start having anger problems.  I'm sorry, Sam, and I'm really sorry to Marcus. I didn... no. I did mean what I said. I don't now, but at the time I meant every last word. But I'm... really sorry. This is one of those times where existing seems a bad idea.  Love, Jon Roskilly
