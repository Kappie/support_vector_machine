Seriously, I just have a hard time being happy for others sometimes; in fact, sometimes their success and happiness can even make me get depressed!  For instance, if I hear about someone starting to date someone else or getting engaged or something, I usually have one of two responses:  skepticism (i.e. "they won't make it") or envy ("Why couldn't that be me finding someone?").  Of course, I'm so horrible at picking up on those "little clues" that are supposed to tell you whether someone likes you or not that a girl would virtually have to smack me across the face with it (or just tell me) before I would proably figure it out.  Or if I hear about someone having something really great happen to them, it's "why couldn't that happen to me?"  And even though I know it's wrong to be like that, that I should be happy for them and with them, it just seems so hard; joy and happiness just don't seem to be things that come easily to me.  Maybe it's partially due to my inferiority complex; I'm always afraid someone is going to be better than I am, that I just won't be able to measure up.  So everything good that happens to someone else is a threat; I feel like I'm getting left behind, like I'm just not keeping up with the experiences and lives that everyone is having.  Of course, I have to admit that this kind of perspective is horribly joy-crippling.  Not only can I not rejoice with other people when they do well, but I can't even be happy with myself when something good happens to me - it was just something that I had to do to catch up with everyone else, or to keep up with what everyone else is doing.  I have to admit that I've been getting better at this lately (so all of you reading this don't have to worry about if I secretly hated you if you told me about something good that happened to you ;).  But at the same time...dang, sometimes it's just so painful.  I hate that feeling, and I want to be able to be happy with other people and all...but most of the time it just seems like I'm trying to keep an "even keel" so that the bad times don't seem so bad.  Of course, this also means that the good times don't seem so good, too...
