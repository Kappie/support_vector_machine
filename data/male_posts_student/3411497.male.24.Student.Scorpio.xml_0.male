I hit the gym a little hard yesterday, and the pain steeming from that is compounded with the pain of knowing its Monday.  When you've got a combination like that, soreness and Monday,  you know it's Monday .  On Mondays, the truth of reality is often impossible to ignore, and this particular Monday morning, stained with the mistakes I made literally yesterday, reminds me of all the mistakes I have made over my figurative yesterdays.  I feel I owe all of my readers, fans, and friends an apology.  My real name is not The Black Blossom.  I have deceived you.  The name comes from long ago when I washed onto the shores adjacent to a dilapidated Burmese nunnery.  It was at this nunnery that I first received my name... The Black Blossom... as they wrote it and an accompanying blessing on a roll of parchment before rolling my basket back out into the Indian Ocean.  I have taken the name to heart, as the blessing imparted on me the qualities of myself that I hold dear: placidity, patience, and mysterious and frightening beauty.  So though The Black Blossom is not my real name, it is my real identity.
