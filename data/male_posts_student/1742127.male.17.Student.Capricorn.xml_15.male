I plan to go to the pool and swim with my Mikey, then I have volleyball games tonight at 5:30 and 7. Soooo it should be funn..... I love volleyball! It's so much fun. Tomorrow is Bekah Bekah's birthday.. so if I don't get on here tomorrow, Happy 18th Birthday Bekah Bekah!!!!!!! :):) The other day Tori, Katy, and I loaded up in my Jeep and took off to P.K. It was so much fun! I love doing things on the moment like that. It just makes it even more fun. I got a better tan and everything! haha.. Well I'm gonna go..short today!
