Everywhere i looked there were tables. Tables are bad, CSS is good. CSS is good because it makes everything more consistent and easier to read and modify.  The links are on the left. This should make life easier because the mouse will most likely already be at the side because that is where the scroll bar is.   There are a few things to change. Heres a list of them 1) The bold is going from the links on the right (to put more emphasis on the headings  [ links archives description] for easier navigation) 2)I'm going to fix the archives 3) There's more but i can't be assed to figure it out now.  Please, comment!
