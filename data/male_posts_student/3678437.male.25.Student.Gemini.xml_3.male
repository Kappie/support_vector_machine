I've KNOWN what blogs are, browsed through a few hundred, wanted to start my own, But...The thought of actually initiating action of any kind is anathema.   Anyhoo, this is the beginning of an exciting period in my life, and I thought I'd chart it online, so I can look back on it fondly (if i succeed) and bitterly (if I fail).   I've been a writer wannabe for a long time, and have written a few short stories (I never realized what the true difficulty of my chosen career path until I tried to write a coherent, well-paced short story within a specific time period, working a certain amount of time each day--rather than wait for 'Inspiration' as was my practise). Now, I'm finally satisfied that I can turn out a story that people won't use to line their trash-cans, I'm about to start work on my first novel.  I've got an idea, an image. The planning, drawing the outline etc. begins NOW... :)
