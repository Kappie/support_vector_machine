One thing I noticed that bugged the shit out of me was the people that woiuld always point out the obvious intentions of the team. Like, "Get a run guys." Well thanks jackass, I'm sure they aren't trying, maybe they didn't hear you. Try shooting a gun at your head to get their attention then maybe you can tell them what to do and we can get this game going. Or maybe, you could set up an intricate trap that would kill all of the fielders so that when the batter hit it there would be not defence. How about instead of actually yelling words you just yell because I'm sure the point of your yelling was to create noise, in which case, a simple "AHHHHHHHH!!!" would have been sufficient.
