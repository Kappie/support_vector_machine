I cannot not comprehend my feelings, and disbelieves, for the settlement known as Orland Park, Illinois. Behold the problems that await you and I in the near future.  As soon as two to three years, the brived, and ignorant city hall of Orland Park, will  finally come to the conclusion that the town would be more nessled and home like with the add on of a mosque. Now, not only has this estonishing goverment been payed off (Seize to believe me? Attend a town meeting), but they basically refuged to discuss questions about the matter with a logical excuse. Your parentals will have to give up money, so the streets can grow in width, for this mosque. Not only does the religion this mosque will hold despise the white race, but they also barely have a population in this town. Unless you come to the conclusion that the town may need you, I recomend you become great friends with the race that is killing your fellow man across the sea.  For I am not rascist, I just do not believe our village should be overran with immagrants, and the number one enemy of our land.  Keep in the mind, that the race already has benefits that people such as myself and others do not, and that the draft may come back in order. USA = Fare you well, Canada = Welcome me with open arms.
