I think she should leave now that she told everyone she was and after all the things she received because she was supposed to leave like a week ago. But no, she started working at a park and now she is talking about her second paycheck which is like two weeks from now. I mean it's fine if she stays, she is the one with the "ballroom" her house is the place where we all hang out the most; but if she already said she'll leave i think she should. Besides i think she talks too much and that she badly influnces certain people with her hypocritical wisdom that i hate.   I hope she moves to Laredo as soon as possible, i think it's better for everyone, even for her and for the people she badly influences.
