But I've gained several female friends. I can't think of any I had before, but I gained Chelsea, Sonia, Rebekah, Michelle, Leigh Anne, Emily, Sarah... (if I didn't mention you - FEEL BAD! because you're obviously not talking to me enough. Stop neglecting me). Realizing this I've also come to realize that I'm more comfortable around girls than guys. And, honestly, I don't have an over-anaylzation for that. We'll just take it at face value. Anyway, I have lost the trust of Leigh Anne for what I told Chelsea. She already knew that I told Robert and then Chelsea managed to get it out of me, and Leigh Anne was obviously the last person Chelsea was supposed to tell, though I told her not to tell anyone. So she told Leigh Anne, destroying any trust she had in me. And this is not the first time. When Zach was about to break up with Kim, he told me, I told Chelsea, and Chelsea told Kim. There were extenuating circumstances, granted, but she was very careless. Now, I don't just go telling anyone anything. The point was, or was supposed to be, that Chesea was my confidant, someone I can trust anything with, and she repeatedly tells other people. In the instance with Zach, we had agreed to keep open a line of communication where we told each other things about Zach and Kim, and neither would know anything. When I finally get any information, it goes from Zach to me to Chelsea, and then immidiately to Kim. The opposite of the intended purpose. In fact it happened before, when Zach told me details of something less important, I relayed that to Chelsea assuming that she would do the same in keeping with the agreement, and yet she immidiately told Kim. So, while I repeatedly broke trust by telling Chelsea, no harm would have ever come had she not broken my trust by telling other people. People I doubt she holds in as high esteem as I hold her. So, at the moment, I am without confidant (except for Sarah, and she leaves the 29th), and I think I'll stay that way for a while. I want to simply build up my friends' trust. They should, and deserve to, trust me. They deserve much better. Trust is something very important to me, and I've abused this sort of thing far too often.
