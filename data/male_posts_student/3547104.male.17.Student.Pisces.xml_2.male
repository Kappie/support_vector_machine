Originally Kim was goin to accompany me to get the tux. Then it turned into Kim, Andria, and me.  Then  it was Kim, Andria, Amy, and me. It later turned into Kim, Andria, me, Amy, Nikita, Loose, Ashley, and Caitlin. Andria then couldn't make it, and Kim and Ashley aren't the best of friends, so Kim dropped out, too. So the actual trip to the mall included: Me, Loose, Caitlin, Nikita, Amy, and Ashley (Also known as my entourage). So the first three went to the mall, and met the latter three there. Caitlin wanted to go to Journeys so we did. And I immediately noticed JB (I saw a big black guy dressed quite conservatively, chewing on a straw... It was obviously JB). He was celebrating his sister Brittany's (Infamously known as Bitty-B) graduation from the 5th grade (HOLLER AT THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL GRAD!) We proceeded to greet JB, and then we departed. I got fitted for my tux and we wandered the mall and ate. I took a picture of Loose wearing a hat at AE, and we got yelled at because I guess it's illegal to take pictures in stores... which is weird, because we weren't yelled at when we did that in the Salvation Army. I went home, slept a little, read a book for like 5 hours ( The Devil Wears Prada  is a damn good book! Get off your ass, buy it, and read it!)... and now I'm here updating you on my wonderful day.   Darcy, Darcy darlin dear you left me dying,  Crying there in whiskey, gin, and pints of beer  I fell for you my darling dear
