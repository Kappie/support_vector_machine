Sadly, though, I don't really care, right now.  I made such a big deal about asking the girl to Homecoming (I even went so far as to write a poem, break it up into stanzas, and leave one stanza and a rose apiece in some of her classes), and I'm glad that I'm getting to go with her, but right now I have more troubling issues on my mind.  One of my closest friends, whom we'll call Rho for now, is having health problems.  Thursday is her birthday, and she's going to be out having tests taken and what not.  That sucks that it's on her birthday, you know?  Rho truly amazed me when she showed up at our regional marching band contest on Saturday in her panther suit (she's the school mascot), and it really showed me just how great a friend she is and how much she means to me.  Now, there may be something seriously wrong, and I don't know what to do about it.  Homecoming is the last thing on my mind.  My best friend's life is the first.
