It's annoying not having any best friends, or even (it seems) any close friends, and only a few "friends". The rest are just schoolmates, and are too busy being with thier best friends to have time to be friends with me. I dont know, it may just be me, well, i guess it is me. Unless things change, i will be posting here more often. Don't mean to offend, just getting things off my chest, so to speak...
