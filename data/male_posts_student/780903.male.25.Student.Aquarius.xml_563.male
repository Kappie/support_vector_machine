Useful stuff to keep in the back of one's head for interviews.  At the bottom of her post, she wonders if maybe I could come up with a parody.  Well, I can at least try.  Ten things NOT to ask a lawyer on the recruiting path:  1. Have you tried Listerine? 2. Is it okay that I've completely forged my transcript? 3. The secretaries -- are they easy? 4. There aren't any German people at the firm, are they?  Because I hate German people. 5. How much did that suit cost?  Looks like a knock-off. 6. My sex change operation turned out okay, right?  Can hardly tell, eh? 7. Did you floss today?  Because I can see some stuff... nah, nevermind. 8. Any crack houses near the office? 9. How do you look at yourself in the mirror every morning? 10. I'm sorry, could you tell me the name of your firm again?  I've suddenly forgotten.
