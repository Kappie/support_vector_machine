I was in a lunchtime interview with the owner for MITY, but I didn't ask if they were closing.  Plus today the students lost the Students vs. Staff softball game...as always...  I won't be attending the EV concert because there's no one to go with that I can get a seat near. Meh, kinda expensive anyway. Geez, if I can't afford the concert, I'll never get a copy of Origin...  So the talent show is tommorow, and I'm doing lighting. Megan Woods is doing sound, but she wants to do lighting for a few acts. No-can-do; we can't have people running around in the booth, and lighting and sound chairs aren't exactly next to each other.  Also dealing with theater, we got a full tour of the Macalester College theatre, including walking up on the catwalks and going up to the top grid (over twice as high as the main catwalks). So that was groovy.  I really should be on Tech crew next year, unless we're doing music, and not if I get a part in the play. Theatre is where I belong...eh, sort of.
