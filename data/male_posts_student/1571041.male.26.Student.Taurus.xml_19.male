Okay, so I know I missed some things for my Baseline Physical that is  needed  in order to fire fight.  Well, I knew of  one thing , which was a reading for the Tubercluosis (TB) test.  Little did I know, until later on of course, that my contact prescription was more on the  old and outdated  side.  That means two things are holding me back from getting on to fight fires.  Well, as it happens, people found out that I wasn't cleared, and not only that, seem kinda anxious to keep me away from fire fighting.  Well, that's my sole opinion on the anxious part.  Anyways, I thought it was just send it all in and that would be that.  Oh no, it has to sit somewhere for so long, and then they pick it up to set it in the " review " pile.  Meaning, it's just put in the " check this out whenever you can " pile, or just sitting somewhere else.  So, I get word I'm not allowed on the line, and I start to calling to get some answers.  It takes awhile, but in the end, I'm finally cleared to fire fight now.  It was really frustrating though, because the crew heads out and goes out on fires, but not me and another guy.  No, we stay in the rigs, or do warehouse duty.  If not that, it's just go home guys.  I wanted to yell around and stuff, but I knew that would get me nowhere, if not further down in whatever pile, if not just somehow, " lost ."  I'm actually proud of myself for not getting too heated and out of hand.  We got out on a fire today and it's going alright.  The person in charge wants some bladder bags (yellow packpacks of water) to work with today.  So, I'm trying to help someone out and carry two to get filled.  Well, I bring them back and start getting ready, but everyone else is lining up to hike out.  I pick up both bags and think, " yeah, someone is going to offer to pick one up ," but that never happens.  So, I'm packing up 2 bags that combined are about 80 pounds of extra weight on top of my own weight ( about 270-280 ) combined with my web gear that carries  other necessaties  like lunch, drinking water, and lunch.  Altogether I"m looking @ about  390  to walk around on.  Not bad though, I do what I do and march on through.  Not the  livliest  or  quickest , but a steady marcher no doubt.  So I use one up, and have another to work with.  This happens about 3 times in the first half of the day.  We take lunch and I give up both bags to two different people and pick up a handtool.  I was proud that I took to bladder bags, carried them both, and used them both numerous times for the first half of the day.  Not only that, but gained respect from forestry and pumper guys, not to mention my own crew members.  I in no way expected that, but it happened, so I'm just waiting to find out what else I'm capable of accomplishing.
