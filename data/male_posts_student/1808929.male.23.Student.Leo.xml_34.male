Our next-door neighbors were Hubert and Celia Beleuw. They were an older couple in their 60s at the time. Both my mom and dad worked and I wasn't in school yet, so Hubert and Celia (everyone called her Sis) took care of me for a whole year. I have lots of stories about them taking care of me during the days, but I didn't find out until many years later that Hubert was in World War II. He was a decorated infantryman at the Battle of the Bulge. While he was in combat he started smoking and he kept on smoking for 40 years until the day that they saw that my mom needed help finding day care during the days. Right before they started watching me he kicked his cigarette habit cold-turkey. All that time I was just too young to really appreciate Hubert and Sis; they both passed away about 4 years ago. They were a part of "the greatest generation."
