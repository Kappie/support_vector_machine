That's all I wanted to say; for those of you who know what had happened; it's resolved for what I consider the positive.    God: Grace. You want her back?  Bruce: No. I want her to be happy, no matter what that means. I want her to find someone who will treat her with all the love she deserved from me. I want her to meet someone who will see her always as I do now, through Your eyes.  God: Now THAT'S a prayer.  --Bruce Almighty
