I overshot my stop again...to paya lebar...so i went to this bus stop, and i saw my cousin, Teck Jui, whus in NS, and he told me 197, the bus i was planning to take home, doesn;t go past my house, contrary to my believes...so i had to walk home from lucky plaza...luckily the rain held itsbreath, and only a few drops came down b4 it stopped again...phew...  generally it was a gd day...i had quite a lot of luck to tide over my bad luck...like meeting my cousin, the rain to allow me to do my hmwrk, etc...tomolo dun tink i'll be supporting, coz i got theory lesson which is of paramount importance to my music theory exams this sat....very scary. So i will have to write a letter....  wow, feel so relieved now... ;0
