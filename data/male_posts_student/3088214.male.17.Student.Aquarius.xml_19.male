Maybe then you could afford to be a principal in Napa.  Thanks a lot for all the reviews- they beat the hell out of Henretta, which is nice because me and him aren't as acquainted as we could be.  Do you think we could start reviewing Jackson through WW1 era?  That seems to be the blankest for me, except for the slavery aspects of it.  Maybe one more essay practice somewhere would be gravy if you could fit it in... maybe a take home one that we could review?  To all my peers- keep on trucking.  The test is coming up fast, but we can study even faster.  GOOD LUCK!  Love, Rob
