(i don't know if it's double L or what) it felt wierd- being in there, its like im in a plane of some sort and all the other things orbiting around it move real fast. the cars that passed by seemed to blur before my eyes. i've been itching to do this since bell field has a really nice view when you look up. i think i ought to do this again.  haha. what a day.
