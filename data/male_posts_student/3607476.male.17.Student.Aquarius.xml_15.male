Haven't done any work at all today.. just been walking around the house with a stupid physics folder in my hand.. pretending im working.. hahaha found out some more in depth personality of some people.. god.. some people are sooo two sided.. funny how i just wanna say it to their face.. but dont. Life sucks.
