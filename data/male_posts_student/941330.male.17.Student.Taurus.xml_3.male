    
         Over and over again  I make the same mistakes, it doesn't end And though this feeling of pain is true It's worth it in the end, I did it for you  At times you walk away and leave me unwhole And nothing can cure me, cure my ailing soul Sometimes I feel my world has been torn apart Then you turn around and give me back my heart
