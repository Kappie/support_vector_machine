I've finding pleasure and meaning in all sorts of things... contemplating the meaning of life in terms of  Conan the Barbarian , community service via food, colors, the sensation of cold, etc. Yea my brain is whacked... it's like every thought spawns countless other ones.   Anyway... the party last night was quite cool. I, of course, was pushing the limits of my physicality. I was doing rolls over Jeff's back and landing hard on the floor... he's a pretty tall guy making the fall a longer fall. A mosh pit on the dance floor, and I have cuts on my knuckles. I feel like I'm a kid again in so many ways.  Shit.. I've got a lot of work... but I'm a lazy ass.  Mmmm beef noodle.  ***
