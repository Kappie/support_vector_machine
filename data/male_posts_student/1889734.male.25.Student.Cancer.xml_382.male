It's like they expect to see a movie about all the good things that Jesus said, and less of the Passion.  Did they read the title of the Film when they went in??  Also, now that I think about it, this film is provoking thoughts that have been buried for a long time.  Christians and Jews have mostly stopped thinking about the opposed ideas built into their faiths.  Most Christians consider Jews as part of the family, while Jews, for the most part, are quite comfortable living and working with Christians.  The term Judeo-Christian has pretty much encapsulated the basis of our culture when it comes to matters of faith.  But the core Truth in Christianity and Judaism are in opposition, and this film is bringing this opposition to our awareness again.  To be perfectly frank, the Jews are monotheistic, and the idea of the Son of God and the divinity of Jesus is completely against their belief system.  It is heresy.  For the Christian perspective, anyone who denies Christ is not in a state of Grace with God, which means the Jews are heretical with respect to the core of Christianity.  Have both faiths conveniently ignored this long enough so it no longer matters?  Is the film forcing this idea to the forefront again?  Is that why it is so devisive?  Religions, as a meme, are driven to achieve domination over all other memes.  That's why a faith exists - to convert others to their way of thinking.  Have we tried to forget this over the past hundred years, pretending that we can all co-exist?
