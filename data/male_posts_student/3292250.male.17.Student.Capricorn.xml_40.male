Isn't it funny how you can stumble into a guy who's looking for what you are, is adorable, speaks French, and doesn't smoke or do drugs but lives so far away it's not immediately feasible until I can drive? * sigh * Being gay is such hard work.   Update:  I've decided to get my self-esteem level up enough to the point of IM-img him or something. What do I have to loose? But to get myself to that point I'm going to need advice and support of my best friends. Some of you know who you are, others of you may not realize that you are. Essentially this means you Alycia, Justin, Mark, "ShanBaby", and Erika. I figure why not get support on my side and go for it. He's adorable like you can't even imagine, and he's actually looking for a relationship and tired of people looking for random sex. Again, why not try it. He's already on my "Hot List". You people just listed: talk to me and I'll get you a pic.
