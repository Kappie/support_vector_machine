I am talking, of course, about the Sony Ericsson T610, Mom dragged me all the way to Merry Hill (which I am really annoyed about, I planned to have a detoxicating day, after the "extreme" amount of activity I was involved in yesterday) to sort out soem problem with her mobile phone - it's my theory that it exploded from sheer adultery overload, you heard about dangerous mobilephone radiation, BUT it's been discovered they explode in your ear should you "adult" to much... lol. Anyway, she was there for a bloody 90 minutes with this sales assistant (I truly felt sorry for her, after about a minute of talking with the Queen of Adult'ing I could see her eyes glaze over as she contemplated suicide, I may send her a commiseration card in the post...) and then finally she picked up the T610, I was amazed anybody could persuade muther to purchase anything with style - however, mum's lack of reality of soon about to reassert itself!! After an hour of screaming like a baby on the bus, "I don't like this phone! It won't do what the Nokia does... What's a theme?", we finally manage to get home. Well, I manage to get home, mum manages to stay in the house for all of 25 minutes before packing her adult'ing gear back into her handbag on the way to The Carphone Warehouse to return the phone. Oh well, Goodbye Phone, you, unlike mum, will be sadly missed. Oh! The shopping trip did, however, produce one of the best lines EVER from the sales assistant: "If you ever run away to America you'll be able to use all your services". I could have DIED!!! In fact, I had to quickly disappear to the Orange store so Mum didnt see me laughing, which may have revealed my actual knowledge about her and Mustard Boy...  Oh, another complain about mother, sorry there's so many today, is that she's decided she isn't going to pay for my lunch anymore. Well, she is, but only sometimes... She's bloody trying to starve me to death! I need my food! Ever since Steph snapped me in half yesterday I've realised that I may be "slightly" underweight... lol. Anyway, I must go now, for I must have a shower and my television needs me! Have ye All Martin J. PS: Why is it that only some MSN customers are "valued"?? I think it's prejudice that is!! QUICK! To the Political-Correctness Mobile!!
