I tried to rock-to-fakie in the medium bowl at the skatepark (4 feet maybe) and I fell on my right hip—the same one I have been falling on for the past month! Damn it hurt like hell. I could barely walk, but I was still trying tricks in the bowls and grinding ledges. Luckily, I didn't fall on it again lol. I probably would have broken my hip. I was happy today because Kevin didn't come with us to the skatepark, just Me, Scott, and Alec. Kevin likes to brag a little too much.  Before I went to the skatepark I went to the Dollar Store with Scott, Alec, and Kevin to buy some candles to use as curb wax. We waxed up a curb at Schweitzer Elementary and tried to grind it. We could all grind it except Kevin—he weighs too much. If he went on a diet he would be able to grind better. After the wax wasn't working very good, we brought a metal bar from Alec's house and set it on the curb and we just grinded on that. It worked a  lot  better. We called it a curb condom. I can't wait to use Alec's condom again tomorrow - lol.
