There was no trolley available, had to drag my super heavy 30kg luggage. I think i built some muscles already =) The imigration department was holding the line back. Took about half an hour to get out from there and to find a nice person waiting , holding a board "Mr. Chee Weng". He drove me to my apartment , Arrow on Swanston. His ride was a luxurious one. Had GPRS , heck he could even charge his phone inside. Took a while to check in , and i found out that my apartment-mate, Lip Zhun was not there yet. Turns out we accidentally left him at the airport (Sorrryyyyy) The apartment looks like a mini hotel. I actually need a keycard to to access the lift , and works as the key to my shack. And guess what, my apartment , with kitchen, toilet , living room and 2 bedrooms, IS AS BIG AS MY ROOM AT HOME!!! But at least everything looks brand new, i guess it shouldnt be a problem living here for a year. After an hour, we got out of our apartment to meet up with Lip Zhun's cousin, this nice guy who knows almost everything about Melbourne. He brought us to the heart of the city, and we met up wif Karen. Lip Zhun and his cousin went their own way for lunch, as me and Kafaii patiently wait for Karen to arrive at Nike shop. Yup, we waited and waited and waited. FOR HALF AN HOUR!!! So sieeen summore so coollddd! We went for lunch, ate fish and chips. And in case u guys are wondering, an average meal here costs 6-8 bucks. Yes its that expensive. Enjoy food as much as u can in Msia. Went shopping later to buy some stuff. Its really convinient to shop here since we're already living in the city... Reached home at about 5pm, finally to get a good rest and a hot bath. I unpacked my bag ( Had to , there isnt even enough place to leave it open ) I went dinner with kafaii and lip zhun, at a Vietnamese Noodle House. Ate a delicious bowl of Beef Noodles, at a huge price though. 7 bucks (7 X 2.8 = ?) After that , boredom. There's absolutely nothing to do here. Hung out at kafaii's place for a while, watching TV. We got bored , so we decided to check out Lip Zhun's cousin's place, which is coincidentally next door !! And OMFG his place is da bomB!!!! He has all kinds of entertainment stuff , he has 1500 K broadband man!!! And he has this really choon PC made by alienware wif a cooling tank at the side wif plastic fishes swimming in it! How cool is that? Not to mention he has the best Altec Lansing speakers connected to his TV and guess wat, he even has Gamecube and PS2!!! And of top of that , FUZZZZBALLL!!! Damn he's got cash. After a while, i got back to my apartment and played a little game of Warcraft3 to kill some time. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
