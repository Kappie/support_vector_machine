The family went out for lunch and Claim Jumper since my aunt was in town. Good stuff. It's rare that I can get my parents to try eating different food.  I also watched Shallow Hal today. It was pretty good, but not hilarious. I guess it's meant to be more sweet than funny. Oh well, I was entertained.  Man... I just haven't been in the mood to write a lot lately.  **
