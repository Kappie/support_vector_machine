But, I did have a great time at the  urlLink DCI  competition (Drum Corps International). It was sooo awesome! I got to see the world champions of last year up close and personal..and my all time favorite band.... urlLink THE BLUE DEVILS !!!!! And I got to see the kick ass show of the  urlLink Madison Scouts . They rocked!! I even liked their show more than the Blue Devils...altho it was a really close race between the two. The  urlLink Carolina Crown  is coming up and fast to be in the top spots this year. From the looks of the performance last night, minus the  urlLink Cadets'  and the  urlLink Cavaliers ' show, I'd say Blue Devils in either 1st or 2nd, and the Madison Scouts right with them, and then Carolina Crown in the top 5 at least! Good luck next week to Scouts and the Devils, and plus my 2nd fav the Cadets...even tho I didn't get to see them play (cuz they didn't show!!) I root for them all the way! They are the DCI band I hope to performe with one day before I turn 21!!! I'll start with the small one tho and go with Carolina Crown this year!   Oh yeah and The Devils won, with the Scouts in a close second! It's gonnabe a great show in Denver at the Championship! Hereis a link tothe scores from last nite's DCI competition results:  urlLink SCORES.    Till Next Time..      ~Laterz~
