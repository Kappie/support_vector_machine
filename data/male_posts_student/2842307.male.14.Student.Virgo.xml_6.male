WHEN you know that a success (a win) doesn't make you and that a failure (a loss) doesn't break you.    WHEN you have made friends with your past, are focused on the  present, and are optimistic about your future.  WHEN you are filled with faith, hope, and love and live without  anger, greed, guilt, envy, or thoughts of revenge.  WHEN you are mature enough to delay gratification and shift your  focus from your rights to your responsibilities.   WHEN you know that failure to stand for what is morally right is the prelude to becoming a victim of what is criminally wrong.  YOU ARE A SUCCESS...  WHEN you are secure in who you are, so you are at peace with your  Creator and in fellowship with others.   WHEN you have made friends of your adversaries and have gained  the love and respect of those who know you best.   WHEN you understand that others can give you pleasure but that  genuine happiness comes when you do things for others.   WHEN you give hope to the hopeless, love to the unlovable, and  are pleasant to the grouch, courteous to the rude, and generous to the needy.   WHEN you can look back in forgiveness, forward in hope, down in  compassion, and up with gratitude.   WHEN you know that the greatest are those who choose to be servants of all.    WHEN you recognise, confess, develop, and use your given physical, mental, and spiritual abilities for the benefit of others.  YOU ARE A SUCCESS when you know that you have been a good and  faithful servant of the Creator of the universe.
