Went gym with XY and Gavin yesterday, other than that, nothing much lol, but lots of stuff happened this week, not about me, but with 2 other people. I can say that it affected me somewhat really, cos' i got to hear both sides of the story. And sometimes, i wonder what would happen if i was in his shoes, how would I feel, I think i would really feel terrible. Ok, pretty abstract stuff there, cos' there has to be a certain level of confidentiality lol. And somehow it also affected on the way I've communicated with her.  AHHHH, i've got nothing to write about my days............ok.......
