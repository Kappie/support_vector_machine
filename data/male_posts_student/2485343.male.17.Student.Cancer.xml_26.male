I'm in a predicament whereas if I go back to Thornton High School, I would be faced with a overload of work. Taking me from first hour to ninth hour, no lunch. Whereas if I stay here at Vantage Point, I would escape with 14 credits and be a regular senior next year. It is hard for me to decide right now because I'm not looking at this from a student perspective, for if I was I would no doubtedly stay here. I am looking at through a social aspect. I want to go back and be with my friends at Thornton, I want to experience the night life once again, the taste of being liked is all to real. It would b too hard though. I need some advice, tag my board. I need it.
