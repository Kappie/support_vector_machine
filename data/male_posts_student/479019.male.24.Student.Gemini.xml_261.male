It's hard for me to accept the whole undergrad life is gone. Especially when Arnold is speaking at UCI on Tuesday!  Esther and I were writing to one another talking about what brings excitement into our lives. I mentioned doing stupid Jackass like stuff as one of the things that do it for me. Something else that's fun is grocery showing with my disc man playing the  Ramones .   I'm feeling really lazy today. I kind of want to go back to bed.  Oh by the way... I'm very much against anyone calling me prior to noon. It better be something important or really good if it warrants waking me up.   **
