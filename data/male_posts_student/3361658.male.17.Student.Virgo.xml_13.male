Then there is the group of people that feels overlooked by society, *cough* emo people *cough*.  But the truth is that they aren't overlooked.  Some people, like me, notice them.  We notice them for what they are... a bunch of crybabies that cannot stand their existance in the suburbs.  You may ask yourself, "What the hell do they have to complain about?"  umm... well not much really, but they find things to complain about.  So in short emo people piss me off (Listening to emo music does not make you emo).  Stop complaining, you have a lot to be thankful for.  Just remember that great Rolling Stones song... "You can't always get what you want.  But if you try sometimes well you just might find... You get what you need."  Try to have fun in life too.
