Also, I'm working on the layout and different things to make people  want  to come back and check it out.  For pure and unmatched intellect and cleverness, visit Steph's or Patrick's blog (if you have the address).  Maybe I'll come up with something good every now and then, though... you'll never know unless you come back. [GRIN]
