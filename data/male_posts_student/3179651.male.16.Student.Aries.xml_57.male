Around 12:20, Bean pulls up with Beth, who BTW called twice when no one picked up after 20 rings, which woke momma cat up. She was pissed because she had told Beth not to expect Lindsey to be her Taxi. (I   Bean, You remember what you and I talked about in the car, so please do that, even though you may not want to because of your feelings or whatever, but it's for the best.     P.S. I'm sorry for asking you for a ride at like 12 something, i'll call you later.
