We've had visions of calling our credit card companies, getting mysteriously routed through to approvals and hearing the true voices of those behind our credit application processes: "Oooh oooh ahh ahhh ahh ooh ooh ooh". We also believe that our warehouse is inhabited by groups of "Monkey-techs"; roving bands of simians that remove the accessories, cartridges, drivers, and cables from units that they "repair" (simian code for coating a broken unit with feces).  It's only now, after seeing footage of some of my superiors on digital video that I realized this phenomenon pervades even the most human seeming tiers of my employer.  From now on, when meetings are run, all I shall hear is "oooh ooh ooooh ah aaaah aaaaahh oooh!"
