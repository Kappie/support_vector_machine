The packing tape we use at work...somehow they've managed to make it smell like ammonia mixed with dirty gym socks...(ugh)  2.  Cold-call salespeople, especially pretty girls.  I'm usually decent at getting rid of the guys (especially the one selling useless toys and whatnot), but somehow the office-supply companies and freight carriers have a knack for getting pretty girls to be their salespeople.  Maybe it's a personal failing, but I just can't tell them to scram...one of them suckered me for over $100 worth of office supplies just by smiling and pointing at things we might need (in my own defense, we did need SOME of them...) :-D
