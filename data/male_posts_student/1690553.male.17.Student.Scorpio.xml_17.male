For the past couple of months we have many cases like that, one of it ends with a death. What is happening now? Is the school compund contaminated with toxic stuffs or radioactive? Don't think so, maybe just a coincidence.   Anyway, my dad now is very interested in getting his hand on the 12" iBook. We plan to visit the MacVision shop after this to test drive the iBook.
