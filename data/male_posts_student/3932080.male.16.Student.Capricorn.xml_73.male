Meanwhile,  Cialis , the erectile dysfunction medicine that claims to outlast  Viagra , has had a 2004 eruption, broadcasting commercials and getting more popularity than ever. Maybe even trumping that fame is  Enzyte , a natural male enhancement pill that has advertised in massive amounts with hard-not-to-like narratives that go through the life improvements of an  Average Joe  who started taking the medication.  Now, even with all this commotion about who has the best medication for men, new reports are surfacing that may push the border with sexual dysfunction medication for women. A  urlLink recent report from Discovery Health  goes through the facts (including the stat that 43% of women suffer from sexual dysfunction as opposed to 31% of men) and seems to foreshadow a future with pills or other medications that sex-starved women can take to help in their searches.  Maybe the universal quandry focuses around an easier solution without pills or medicines to help us fulfill our desires. Isn't there anything easier? Hell, if one of my nephews ever has impotency problems, I'll just buy him an Erector set.
