Gibson and he didn't wear sun screen.  His stomach and chest is SO sunburned. That's what happens, as I know all to well.  My dad took my entire family out to eat lunch.  We went to cheddars, one of my favorite resturaunts. I had the Rajun Cajun Chicken. As always, it was premium. Then we had a fudge desert and i about lost it. But, with my amazing will power, I saved everybody the trouble.  Then we went to look at PDAs. That would stand for Personal Digital Assitant. Not Public display of affection. Which is really annoying. The pocket PCs were cool too. But we don't know which one is the right one yet. They're cool...and expensive...i need some money...not for one of those, just money in general...Anyway, after that we went to the at cell phone place to look at those. I'm going to get a cell phone soon because i'm going into highschool, and my dad can get a certain kind of cell phone(which is pretty cool) for free. But not until we have a dallas residency for a dallas number.  We went to Barnes and Nobles right after that. Dilbert comics ensued. They're hilarious. Some of them are over my head, but I get most of them. Being a comic writer would be interesting to have as a your major occupation. You'd have to be funny, have a good sense of humor everyone can relate to, and be a fairly good artist. Then you have to convince your local paper to accept another comic strip in the Sunday paper. A very important boost to a one's profession.  I went to see my Great grandmother after that at the land of doom rehab center. She's the best person there. She hurt her ankle pretty bad, so she has to get it back up to walking strength. That'll take awhile.  That place though...Ehuaheuh! Ugh, it's out to get you, the smell penetrates you and goes right through your chest until it aches. I want to get her out of their. Already I'm formulating an escape plan...that includes mile long systems of under ground tunnels....That'd take awhile to dig.  It's a long term escape plan. Just like a trip to Russia on foot. Time waits for no one, not even me while I'm blogging, so I gotta go!
