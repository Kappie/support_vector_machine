These two days are actually quite a wastage of time (no offense to Mrs Thong.....but seriously!). I could have used the morning time to study you know! I find that I am seriously lacking of time!! I only study in the morning and afternoon. That's all. Give up night to study? No way man! I already made a lot of sacrifices!! Thereore, I am irked by the fact that I have to come back in school in the morning for both days. Meow!!  Hmm..English today is not bad la. I scored a surprising 31 marks in the compre. I think I let my guard down too much when it comes to easy papers. HaHa! Okay....meow meow! I went back home at around 2pm. I want to rush home to start revison!   Chan le la! I got stomach cramps...why do they always do this to me now? Gtg le...see ya tomorrow. Night!
