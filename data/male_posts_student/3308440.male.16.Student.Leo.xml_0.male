Physics was fun having a water fight (again) while using a big electric thingy... hmm not really a good idea now was it meh nevermind of course i had to use the big electric thing (it's like one of thosse things which make your hair go up)   so I am holding on to it while evryone was touching me...  ;) causing me to get electric shocks and then playing cards in our german lesson instead of revising was a good idea.  ah well a relaxed day comes to an end.  See ya  Dan :)  Current mood: Happy but thirsty  Current music: Linkin Park - In the end
