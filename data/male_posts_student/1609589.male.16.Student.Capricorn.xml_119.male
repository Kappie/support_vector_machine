I kept looking at the ceiling, but i couldn't move my head. I could feel the armrest, and I could feel the bloodpressure thing on my arm, but it's like the world had stopped...  They had turned the gas off. I didn't know. I thought for sure this was gonna suck, because either i had built up a tolerance like superman, or they had it on a timer and didn't know.  When they turned it back on, I almost said "goodbye." before I went under. Wouldn't have done any good, though. I was already numb.  Everybody says that everybody's voice is like an echo, but it's more like a large hall, and it was almost like i'd heard what they were saying before. One huge deja-vu trip.  Wierdest thing was- I couldn't tell them that the gas was torturing me. They would ask me questions, and I would respond. I couldn't tell them to turn the gas off, or down. They'd say "how're ya feelin?" and I'd respond with something reminiscent of a thumbs up, or a nod, or something. They asked me if the gas was working, and I couldn't help but smirking, she said "i saw you getting a little goofy-faced."  I wonder if they realized how much i was sweating...  I was lost in the ceiling, that's all that mattered... the two heads looming over me were just kind of pushed to the side... There wasn't really any feasable thing to explain... except for what I heard.  I'd say about half of it was me trying to make sense out of what i was hearing, and the other half was my pulse monitor, and the dentist's chatter.  You know that acid music that you hear, that just... it's just so. ... stoned.  That's what it was, it wasn't music, but me trying to understand it filled up the half-hour or so needed for the surgery. If that.  I honestly don't know what was going to happen when I sad down in the chair... they took my blood pressure about half a million times, and then she put the mask on... first my feet... then my arms... slowly, my body just drifted off into nothingness, and i was just... there. Me.... and the ceiling.  I never want to see the dentist again.
