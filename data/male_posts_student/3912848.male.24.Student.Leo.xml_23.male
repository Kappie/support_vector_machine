He was in town organizing folks to collect signatures to get his name on the Texas ballot.  Nader's speech focused on condemning corporations.  Specifically he criticized law schools for their focus on corporate law and lack of concern for public interest law and issues.  Mostly your typical Marxist-Socialist rodomontade;   Corporations bad, universal healthcare good.  Nader is certainly not troubled by the prospect of drawing votes from Kerry.  He sees politics, as he sees life, as a fight between the corporations and the people.  In his view, both Rs and Ds are in the pockets of the unaccountable corporations and will remain so as long as corporations are allowed to fund campaigns.  Essentially, there is no significant difference between Republicans and Democrats so he cares little if he helps Bush to win.  In this view, Nader has much in common with the libertarians, who, by the way, were also present, asking folks to sign a petition to get their candidate on the ballot (whoever their candidate is).     Interestingly, this is the second time since declaring his candidacy that Nader has spoken at UT.  I guess since his goal is to get the highest percentage of nationwide votes he can (and therefore receive federal money the next time around) he is focusing on getting on the ballots in the biggest states Bush will certainly win. No matter how many votes Nader draws from Kerry, Bush will win all of Texas' electors.  Nader's is a good strategy if your goal is to win 5% of the popular vote and not the overall election. (BTW, over 10% of Austin voters voted for Nader in the 2000 election.)  Nader received this week's   Federalist  "Alpha Jackass" Award  for this quote:   "We are dealing here with a basically unstable president. ... We are dealing with a messianic militarist. A messianic militarist, under our constitutional structure, is an unstable officeholder. Talk about separation of church and state: It is not separated at all in Bush's brain, and this is extremely disturbing."   --Ralph Nader, responding to Bush's statement in Bob Woodward's book that he prayed "for the strength to do the Lord's will" when committing the nation to go to war in Iraq.
