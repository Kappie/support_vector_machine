We meet some people there and we all played lava. it was a good game, didnt last long though, but good none the less. Then we all went back to ryans house. joey, shane, and caitlin came over to. Thats when the guilt trip started. See i didnt mind hanging out with her its just that it seems like everytime we talk now she brings a fucking guilt trip on. And not to mention last night wayne was helping her. But after wayne and caitlin and ryan and shane left for a while me and joey talked. Joey agrees with me that im doing the right thing because he had the same thing happen in his relationship except he was on the recieving end. He said its better that i suggested me and caitlin take a break because if i wouldnt have then we probably would have broken up in a really horrible way. By having a break we both have the ability to think things through, on were we are in our relationship, how we feel, what we need to do to get everything straightend out. I only wish she understood it that way. It seems the only way she sees it is by thinking im slowly breaking up with her and i should feel sorry for what ive done. As i told her before i dont know what the outcome of this break will be we could get back together or we could stay apart, i just dont know. But until then everyone that thinks im wrong can keep their opinons to themselves because this is not your decision.
