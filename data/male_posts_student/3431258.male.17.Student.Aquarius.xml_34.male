Bought it from  Locked Street  and it looks really good. i guess a lot of people will laugh at school, it's gonna be cool.    Now i have to study 1 hour per day. My mom's gonna check me. It's not negative or anything, in fact i don't mind.   Got a new feature on my desktop. Some kind of act bar like on  MAC OX . Really neat and useful. I'll post a pic sometime soon.  Regards,  Zephyr
