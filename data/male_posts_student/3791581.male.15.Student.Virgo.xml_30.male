And I find there are several things I miss about Canada.    I envy your conveniently coloured money.  Or as some of my old college friends would say, "monopoly money."  The colours are prettier and easier to decipher.  You can tell a true Canadian by the way he/she speaks.  I miss the way Canadians pronunciate and annunciate their words.  So much better on the ears.  I am fed up with the southern drawls and Yankee slurred talk.    And finally, most everyone in Canada speaks English!  Here, I'm struggling to get through a patient's initial evaluation with broken Spanish.  And my patients have the audacitiy to ask me why I don't speak Spanish!  We are living in North America!  To all my Canadian cousins, Happy Canada Day!
