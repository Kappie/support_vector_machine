Too many spoilt pictures...oh, some were very okay la.....And i noticed that my legs aren't exactly the desirable leg-shapes...ayioh.....There's nothing like photos to bring out the worst in you. Hmm...tomorrow showing CQ they all.....meow meow!  Ayiah..I don't know what to do after this. Probably read my book. I am always reading. And I love to read.  Me-ow Meow!
