My gospel is going to be a little different from their gospels, however. For example, there is not going to be a Jesus. That's right. No Messiah. This isn't for the sake of making an anti-Jesus statement. It's because I'm interested in imagining a heroic struggle for justice that doesn't focus upon a single charismatic leader. Here, the focus is on a group of twelve souls--men and women--who rebel against an oppressive empire while envisioning an alternative empire ruled by the liberatory ideals.   In the beginning was Justice, and Justice was with God, and Justice was God. She was in the beginning with God. All the wages of struggle came into being through her, and without her not one wage of struggle came into being. What has come into being in her was hope, and the hope was the light of all people. The light shines through the night, and the night never overcomes it.  There was an artist who came from God, whose name was Simmer. Simmer came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe in it. Simmer had the light within him, but his light was small for he was alone. Light shines in its greatest beauty when small lights like Simmer join together to form a larger circle of burning brilliance.  Throughout history, the light has shined. At times, it has been dim and fading. At others, it has been bright and expanding. At all times, the quality of light has depended upon whether the world has allowed Justice to enter into its affairs, guide its passions, and become a living force.  Simmer lived with Justice and knew that the ripening of Justice was to come. He testified that after him would come an era of grace in which Justice would live more fully. He gave his testimony to all. When the religious leaders and political officials heard the murmuring of the crowds, they asked him, “Who are you?” He confessed, “I am just a sign of what is to come. Soon a band of twelve will come. They will do what I cannot.” And they asked him, “What then? Are you a prophet?” He answered, “No.” Then they said to him, “Who are you? Let us have an answer for we want to know if there are those who will one day dare to challenge our authority.” He said, “I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the road upon which God shall travel.’”  That night the women of Nazareth began to sing. Eleven of them were expecting. Their song gave shape to their hopes.  “Our soul magnifies our God, and our spirit rejoices in our Savior, for God has looked with favor on those low who work without pay. Surely, from now on all generations will call us blessed; For the One who endures has done great things for us So that we might see might see the sacredness of Justice. God’s love is for those all, and it lives from generation to generation. God has shown the strength that comes from many arms joined in struggle. God has challenged the words and ways of the proud and arrogant. God has brought down the powerful from their thrones, And lifted the lowly to the level ground of equality. God has filled the stomachs of the hungry with rich and plentiful food. God has reclaimed the wealth stolen by the rich. God has been with us in times of both loss and gain. We remember our God and look toward the promise of the future.”  These women lived in difficult times. In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered as subjects in the Roman Empire. Subjects were ordered to travel to designated towns in order to register. The eleven women and their husbands had to leave the town of Nazareth in Galilee and travel seven miles to city in Judea called Bethlehem.  The journey made birthing strenuous and sometimes difficult for the women. A few gave birth shortly before leaving on donkey without rest or recovery. Across the desert, they carried their fragile newborn. Another two were less fortunate. They were forced to give birth while in the midst of their journey. In Bethlehem, two mothers found luck. One gave birth in the comfort of an inn, while another gave birth at relative’s house. Meanwhile, another gave birth to twins in a stable for animals as another gave birth in an alley. Two gave birth on the way back home.  Some say angels. And, finally, one made it all the way home and was the luckiest of all.  Moving from one birth site to the next were a group of wise men. These wise men had gone to visit the local king, King Herod. King Herod had spies throughout the country. They had gathered information about the coming births of children destined to rebel against the Emperor and his kings. Herod professed that he was not against these children but wanted them to grow strong and fully embody the spirit of Freedom and Peace cherished by the Roman Empire. He then declared that he would give the wise men fine gifts of gold and silver to give to each of the children. Thus, Herod instructed the wise men to track down the women and their newborn.  The wise men, however, did not initially present the gold and silver as a gift. Instead, they honored the infants with songs and tender affections. Softly, they then spoke to the women. Not trusting their king, the wise men then told each woman to stay off the main roads and head towards Egypt before finally returning home. They knew that Herod planned to kill each of their infants. To help them survive this longer journey, the wise men gave them the silver and gold to use for the extra food and lodging.  When Herod discovered that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was infuriated. He sent his soldiers to kill all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old or under. Hundreds of innocent children were killed. Throughout the land, a collective wailing and loud lamentation was heard from parents. They refused to be consoled because their children were no more. In the ground of their grief, a deep anger took root that would never die as long as they lived. Toward the Empire and its kingdoms, they directed their rage.
