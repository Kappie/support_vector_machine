Well there is this girl that is obsessed with me. She is really annoying, her name is Kym. I just wish she would give up, obviously she not my type. At one time I did go out with girls but that ended this year when it all got to complicated. Blah. I am getting really nervous, this parade Saturday will have 20,000 people and I have a trumpet solo. Its also localy televised. I might just pass out before I get to the judges stand then I don't have to play. So far our marching band is undefeated, but then again we only marched two parades. We have a really small band with like less than 40 people. We have no color guard, to bad. I hate being a virgin, it makes life very boring. At the moment there is only one person I want to lose my virginity to and that is Ryan. Ah you basterd why do you have to be some god damn stubborn. Thanx for the comments Amanda, at least I know someone has read my posts. Well that's all for now. TTYL
