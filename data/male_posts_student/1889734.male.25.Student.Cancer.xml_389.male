A few months ago, I finished Dan Simmons book, Ilium, which also revolved around Troy and the Iliad, and it whet my appetite.    So I picked this up and started on it over the weekend.    "Rage - Goddes, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles, murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses, hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls, great fighters' souls, but made thier bodies carrion, feasts for the dogs and birds, and the will of Zeus was moving toward its end. Begin, Muse, when the two first broke and clashed, Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles."  Great stuff.  Achilles was the perfectly designed 'Greek-killing Machine'.  He doesn't just kill Greeks in small quantities. Rather he brings an modern assembly line efficiency to his Greek killing.
