I told you I wouldn't call it "My Fourth Blog...o-iii  I went home, destroyed the rest of the tree, mowed the lawn, dusted our evil banisters (they're made of cast iron, and are all curly and stuff. they eat people's fingers. and my shirts...), and other such stuff. I get paid for it now, yipee, cos I haven't got a job yet,  through no fault of my own I should like to add!   Projects for the summer: digging a pond and learning HTML properly. Well, I've got eight weeks of boredom so I might as well be doing something. Ho hum. We've got this sort of rockery, and two layers of grass (with the rockery in between them), and so the pond's going on the bottom, with a little waterfall going down. I dunno!  Bin told today that I'm not allowed to learn the clarinet. Oh well. Instead I get my 1/2 hour subsidised lesson with our unbeliveably cool piano teacher at school. We'll just jam for 1/2 hour ever week.  YEH   That's about it for today, adios untill next time...   p.s. thanks to my Dad doing EDEXCEL A-Level marking online, I may not be able to post every day. Not that you care.
