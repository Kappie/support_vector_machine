Anywho, this guy representing the fop (I'll just call it that because it makes them sound ignorant) called saying "Good day to you sir... are you the man of the house? BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH would you like to donate $45, $35 or play it safe and pay $25"...  Anyway, he called three times and my dad was asleep but picked up the phone the first time and hung up when he said he was from the F.O.P, then the 2nd time I picked up and when he said he was from the fraternal order of police I went "bye" and slammed the phone down. He then called again... the third time. I was writing when the wanker called and anyway felt like speaking my mind so I said "I'll tell you what, I'm 14 and, of course, am not the man of the house, but I would like to speak my mind because I can't vote on state,  federal, or local issues, and you know that. Quit bothering the hell out of people who have lives, I'm sorry you don't have enough funding for the benifits of officers, but tough... everyone else is having a hard time too, maybe you should do something about it by talking to Jo Ann Davis, the first district congresswoman, or Harvey Morgan, your state delegate, or your senators" He goes "Well, have a nice day sir." ::slam::  Ok, just for the record, a different guy from the fop called twice while I was writing this post making that a total of five times.  I would just like to say in my nearly 15 years of life, I have never once been saved by the police. Never.  We've had things stolen, they did absolutely nothing about it. And the time we were down in Myrtle Beach shooting fireworks (we didn't know it was illegal since we saw fireworks being shot all up and down the beach) the guy had pepper spray in one hand and half a doughnut in the other and threatens to chase us. The most they've ever done is harass me. If I'm ever murdered and gone, once you're gone, you don't come back. Justice is a nice thing but I think prosecutors do more of a job than the police do in that case.  ~ George
