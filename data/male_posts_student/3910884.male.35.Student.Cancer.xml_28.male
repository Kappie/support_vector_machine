I think it's possible to treat social justice issues in the Philippines as a disaster such that recipients receive aid that increases their level of human dignity based on the Humanitarian Charter of the U.N.    http://www.sphereproject.org    Must also remember to get a book by Sionil Jose recommended by Chiara. There's a National Bookstore at the Nepo Mall but I was told that there's a larger one over at SM Mall in San Fernando.
