Yeah, my father picked us up at 8. Meowing moo.   We went to AMK to eat. I want to go back to AMK Ave 5's to eat, but it is STILL under rennovation. Sheesh. We then went to Central to eat lor. I ate the meatballs with century eggs porridge. It was a bit bland, but oh meow. My mother ate the cuttlefish porridge and Father the dried fishball noodles. Yeah.  Today, my Mother wanted to cook curry fish-head. However, all the markets doesn't seem to be carrying fish heads!! We tried the NTUC nearby, but it was to no avail. We were about to go back home. However, Mother tried one last attempt to buy fish heads. She suggested Takka Market at Little India. Why not? We set forth on our journey there.  I was so bored that I started SMSing WQ using my Mother's handphone. Sigh. When I asked what he was doing, he didn't reply. Then I lammented about his slow reply. After he still didn't reply, I SMSed him telling him that I didn't dare to call him in case I annoyed him further (and I probably did la). After a while, he smsed back with something like "Charging! Silent mode!" Oppsie. Sigh. I think I am very very possessive. When people don't reply me, I get very very paranoid and possessive. I think I am annoying. Heh.  Well, Takka Market was Block 665 (Incidentally, Wendy's block is the same number). We finally found a stall with fish heads. HaH. My mother as usual tried to bargain, but the stall owner was very put-off. He said "I don't have time to bargain with you! My fish is very fresh!" HAHAHA! So funnily stupid. My mother rolled her eyes (heh! so funny to see her do that!). After that, we also brought crabs. Meow moo! Anyway, on the way home, I was checking on the crabs to see if they are alive. I touched one on the underside, and my thumb has a speck of shit on it! AHHHHH!!! Stupid idiotic crabs! Meow moo meow!! I have to air the cab too. The fishy smell is terribly stinky.   We went back home. Hmm. WQ came online! Meow moo. He then asked me to go out to AMK Central with him to buy some PS2 toy. Hmm. Okay with me. I had to go eat my lunch first. Lunch was chicken rice at Admiralty Place. How meowful.  I met WQ at 1 something. I brought along 10 bucks. It was to be used for buying games. Hmm. WQ announced that he's going to Funan the IT Mall instead. Okay. Anyway, my parents were able to get FFX and FFX-2, so I can use my $10 to buy books. Anyway, we chatted a lot on the train. Remincised a lot too. Heh.   He went to buy the Eye Toy at Funan. It was this motion sensor thing that lets you play the games intoa totally new perspective. Thing something along the lines of Para Para. Yeah. I brought a Sabrina Special Edition,"Ten Little Witches" at a bookstore! Meow meow! After that, we decided to take 960 bus home. We walked all the way to the Esplanade. HaHa. We even went to the library@Esplanade. It was kinda cosy, but really nothing for me. As I said, we took the bus back.  On the bus, I read my blog. What a fantastic book! I love mystery thrillers! The ending is surprising too! WQ and I alighted at the stop after Marsiling MRT. He wants to go home, so I accompany him to his block and later take 911 back. I sent him off, and I walked towards Causeway Point. I didn't want to take bus after all.   I got a feeling to go find Wendy, so I went to find her lor. She was having her dinner break, but she accompanied me lor. We walked round and round Causeway Point, chatting. I even treated her a drink. Heh. It was great talking to her. It always is. I finally told her my dream I had on Sat (which I wanted to on Sunday, but she went offline while I was watching Moulin Rouge). Heh Heh. She told me lotsa things too. Meow moo. I went home at around 5.40, when her break ends.   Hmm. After bathing, I played a little FFX. Wee! It was kinda fun. The Battle System was kinda confusing at first because it was different from FF9's, but i adapted to it la. I am now at the first save point. Anyway, I ate my dinner, read my book and watched TV. Oh yes, I had a bit of chilli crab just now. Meow meow meow.  Oh well. WQ got his PS2. I don't think he will be online that often. I always hate it when he got games to play. He is always never online de. So hard to talk to him. ~pouts~  Okay. I end this blog le. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
