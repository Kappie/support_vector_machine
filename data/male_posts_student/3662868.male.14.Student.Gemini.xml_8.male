Only because they were after me. This place isn't safe. Someone stole my moms really shitty bike, my neighbors kids turtle is missing, and now I almost get my ass kicked for riding a bike. Rockville is turning into a ghetto right before my eyes. Things are bad enough where I don't feel safe on the streets. I wish I had a weapon. Knives aren't real enough for me anymore. I don't want to have to get that close to use one, because if it came to the point where I had to draw my knife to defend myself, it would probably already be too late. I didn't have much to write about, and wanted to put something out, so here it is. More randomness as it comes to me.
