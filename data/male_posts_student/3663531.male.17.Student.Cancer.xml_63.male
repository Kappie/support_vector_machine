Childhood and through adolescence are referred to as the "best years of your life". We spend most of our years struggling to live up to everyone's expectations- whethere these be to succeed, or to be weird, or to exist on the edge of everything, ghosting about. So, school must be something...  But for now, I'll settle with a simple "I hate school"
