Winning only three matches and losing the rest has cemented the fact in people's minds I can't predict soccer outcomes correctly.  As usual perennial underachievers Spain tripped on their own flailing feet and couldn't progress through to the next round. However Italy and Germany had the same fate.  (F***ing B*******)!!!   After Greece won the opening match with Portugal( by the way,   Christiano Ronaldo is gay )what followed was a terrible string of losses that hurt my pockets deeply.   Quarter's and semi's were just as horrifying. Nightmares plaqued me from then on with the grotesque evil image of Greece coach Otto Ragueal torturing me with a hook filling my mind evertime I closed my eyes.  In the end the final was upon me with surprise package Greece combating host country Portugal in a repeat of the opening match. Guess what, I lost money buying on Portugal to win .(Did I mention Ronaldo is gay)    F***ed up EURO 2004...    Regards, B.C aka Star_Of_Light
