For about a year's salary in many regions of the world,I purchased a digital music player capable of playing songs from 1) my CD collection, 2) songs purchased from download sites, and 3) songs "borrowed" from the fine users of internet file-sharing sites. Also, lest I be caught at some point in my life without immediate access to the 1994Live-at-Soldier Field version of 'Black Muddy River' by the Grateful Dead, I opted for the 40Gb(10,000 song version) as opposed to the measely 20Gb(5,000) song version. Thus I have joined the elite ranks of the 3 million other IPod users.    Why am I such a slave to the consumer culture? Is this IPod really something I need? Apparently so. Is it that I need 10,000 songs at my fingertips, or do I need theIPod status symbol that says, 'Hey, look at me, I have enough flexible income to buy something clearly excessive both in price and functionality?'Maybe I am just doing my part to 'keep the economy rolling.' No, thats not it. To put it in perspective, lets see what else I could have done with my $389.94 (aftergovernment discount and tax):   1) Purchased approximately 30 cases of beer and provided an excellent party for my friends who mean more to me than anything (even music).   2) Supported102 starvingchildren for 1 month each ($0.23 per day) throughthe Feed the Children Foundation.   3) Purchased 1/3000th of a$1.2 million 'smart-bomb' used to 'defeat the evil-doers' and'destroy haters of freedom'...and everyone knows, ILOVE freedom.   4) Donated the money to the presidential campaign of my choice...or similarly, just thrown it in the trash...this election is particularlydifficult for me--I have problems with Bush (for obvious reasons),but I also have problemswith the Kerry/Edwards ticket (as Edwards is a former malpractice lawyer).     As it stands, I amambivalent about the purchase. Perhaps, I can make myself feel better by saying, 'Although I chose to spend my money on the IPod, everyone else should take the money they would have spent on the IPod and use it instead for one of the above four options.'Ah, hippocracy, always a friend of guilt. But, I really, really love music. Ah, rationalization, another of guilt's allies. Damned moral compass. urlLink
