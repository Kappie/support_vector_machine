Then I went to Schley.  I like the school.  It's clean and not confusing...only one story.  They freaked when they heard that I could build websites...it seems that no one knows how to there...sad really.  I met the head tech guy and he agreed to let me work with him 2nd block so that's cool.  Then 4th block I'd be in journalism and since I've already taken it once...so that shouldn't be such a big deal.    The only thing I am going to miss at my old school is Lit. class.  I like Literature a lot.  I think that that was the one class in my entire 7 that I felt like going to.  The people were nice in there and I will definitely be keeping in touch with them.  I don't know for sure when I start but I will definitely let all of you know.    Fare the Well.
