You ever see those ads on the TV that say you can get a catalog of free information from the government, and all you have to do is write to Pueblo, Colorado? Well guess what I did. Not only that, they gave me 15 copies of everything. The box weighed about twelve pounds. If you ever desire a booklet on how to invest wisely, what medicines not to mix, or how you will be affected by the onset of menopause, I'm the man you want to see.
