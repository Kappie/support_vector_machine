While I was going on with my rant, one of my friends looked to me and said, "Whitey, why do you care about the government and politics and all that crap? Its not like it effects you or anything." I looked at my friend in wide-eyed astonishment, thinking to myself, "did he REALLY just say that?!?!?!" No offence to my friend or anything, but Good Lord! Doesn't effect me? Are you serious?! Now while I was completely blown away at this statement, I kept my cool, which, needless to say, was pretty tough. I looked at him and said "How does it NOT effect me? Congress passes bills everyday that could alter our way of life forever, and I'm not supposed to care?" He looked generally intrigued, which is unusual for someone who is only passing because he's an EXCELLENT football player. He looked at me and replied "I just don't see how politics effect me, considering I'm not even old enough to vote yet." I wanted to give him a deep reply, something that he would hopefull remember. So I said "There are many types of politics, Governmental and Social. An example of Governmental Politics would be something like the Legal Drinking age being 21. Social politics would be something like you not being able to get even a C+ on a math test and yet are still passing the class because of your football Skills." Being the thick headed Jock my friend is, all he said was "I still don't see why you care."  What's sad is that this is the general attitude that most teens have towards politics. Why should they care? Why should it matter what the "adults" pass. I'll tell you why! Because in the not so distant future WE will be the adults, and we will have to live with the laws that Congress passes. I, for one, don't want my kid to come home from school one day and say "Dad, I met my friend Johnnys Parents today, they're names were Adam and Steve! It was cool that he has TWO dads!" No...not on my watch...not in MY name. I don't want to catch my kid smoking a joint and him saying "don't worry, dad, its legal!" Again, not in MY name.   Allow me to quote a line from a song by the Dropkick Murphys, the Song is called The New American Way: "The Morals of this nations youth have long gone astray, led by tolerance, indifference, and this kinder, gentler way that has corrupted and destroyed so many of our boys and girls, Oh Lord I wonder will it ever come around." I could not have said it better myself, they nailed it. In a world were you HAVE to be Politically Correct, where if you disrespect someone you will more likely then not to be sued, all we are is molding our kids to be Socialist Anti-Americans.   Political Correctness is probably one of the worst things that coould have happend to America, Political Correctness means always having to say you're sorry, even if you aren't! Blacks aren't Black...they're AFRICAN AMERICAN...but the White kid from South Africa is just that...a white kid, from South Africa.   Well this concludes my rant for the day, probably not one of my best written pieces but its how I feel at this point in time, and I know for a fact that I went a little off topic when I went off on PC, but hey, what can you do right?
