Why do I like Mitsuda?  a) He's cute. b) He's cool. c) His music is amazing.  The weirdest of all is the music I love him for. You see...Mitsuda makes video game music, something I have no shame in liking. But I don't feel he should be making video game music. He's.....different. He's got a real talent. Eh. Anyways, the site is in Japanese, so that will be a problem for some(most? all?) of you. There is an English page, but it rarely gets updated.
