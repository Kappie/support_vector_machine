As i said then, i had to go to the dentist to get a filling.  I really hate going there, but today it wasnt so bad.  Through my mom, word got around that i was attending UofT Scarborough in the fall.  Well my dentist attended UofT as well, and he had some tips for me (nothing im gonna talk about, i need the edge :P)  After that pep talk, he left me to attend to other ppl.  I had been tired all morning, and the "Business Weekly" that was on the TV wasnt helping me.  I was just about to doze off when he returned and gave me the filling between questions and comments about university.  The whole thing took 5 mins, but i was the 30 min wait before that killed it.  Finally, my mother (who also got a filling) and I left the building and stood outside for our ride.  10 mins later we were on our way to our new house.  There, my brother and my mom went for a look inside while my stepfather and I stayed in the van.  It was quite silent in the van, not that any of us minded tho, he was reading something and i was listening to music.  15 mins later we got home.  After eating some leftovers, my parents and my older bro left my younger bro and I at home.  After starting up my msn and media player, i started messing around wit my blog template.  I didnt get too far, i widened the body part, thats about it.  Then i decided that i needed to clear my mind of what had been bothering for a while, so i went outside to run some ball.  Upon arrival, i noticed that there was not a single person at the courts or the adjacent park.  Nice... some silence is always welcome.  There i worked on my game a bit... mostly pull-ups and left-handed layups.  My jumper is coming along little by little.  I discovered some things that i didnt notice before.  Well before i get into that... heres the ideal pull-up:  Perform a cross over move of some sort, throwing ur defender off balance.  Shortly after making ur move stop on the spot, but as u do this, make sure that ur feet are lined up to the net, right foot (if ur right handed) slighltly on front of ur left, shoulder with apart.  Take a moment to collect urself and align ur shoulders to the net, then elevate straight up.  As u go up, bring the ball in ur right hand on front of ur face, slighlty to ur right, locking in ur right elbow to ur side while using ur left hand to support the ball.  On ur way up or at the peak of ur jump, release the ball, not pushing it, but stroke the ball towards the net in.  Ensure that ur shot has sufficient ark and rotation, improving ur chances of getting it in or getting a "shooter's" bounce.  To help make sure that u followed through cleanly, as u land ur hand should be above ur head, slightly tilted forward.  Now the only thing left to do is to listen to the swish of the net and the "oohs" and "ahhs" of the spectators.  That being said, i noticed some things about my shot.  Firstly, i was holding the ball too far to the right.  My elbow was somewhat locked in, but it was angled out to far.  This caused my shot not to look straight, tho it usually went in.  Not a big problem... but could result in inconsistency if i didnt hold the ball far enough to the right.  That was easy to fix. Secondly, i didnt always align my feet.  After u do a cross over, its not uncommon for ur feet to be pointing away from the net.  Well when i crossed to my left, my feet would point left.  This resulted in many bricks and air balls... not cool. Finally, i was not releasing at the peak of my jump.  When i started my ball career, i was a set shooter.  This meant that i would release the ball as i jumped, giving me more power but making it easier to block me.  I gradually developed my jumper, and have been happier ever since.  Well as i did my jumpers, i noticed that i was releasing the ball on my way up.  But i wouldnt release it at the same time every time, making my shots inconsistent.  So i started releasing the ball at the very peak, and they went in more often.  But more importantly, i didnt have to think about how much power to put, it just seemed to flow.  Well as i practiced, 3 girls started shooting on the other net.  I didnt get a good luck at them (mostly cuz my i didnt have my glasses), but they seemed really young, prolly 12-13.  So i continued to shoot around, not paying them any attention.  After an hour or so, i ran to the fountain.  I have mentioned this fountain before, but that fountain is soooo great!!! (excuse my lack of vocab)  Like, after u work up a sweat from playing all day in under the sweltering sun, nothing feels better than cooling off in the fountain.  I think i go to the courts for the ball, but stay for the fountain.  Anyways, if u ever come to visit me, the first thing i'd take u to see is the fountain.  Then i'd make u run through it with me... like lil kids.  Good thing i bring a ball to the court, otherwise those parents would look at me funny...  Well, after awhile, one of my friends from school, his bro and his cuz came and started shooting around on dif nets.  Moments later, another guy i played wit b4 came to run some ball.  We ran 2v2, me and my the 2nd guy vs my friend from school and his bro.  I started the game off weak, lost the ball, missed a few hook shots, threw some bad passes.  Before i knew it we were down 6-4.  So i stepped it up, my friend from school whos smaller than me was guarding me, so i just posted him of, drop stepped to my left and made the smooth baby hook.  After my teammate made a few baskets, i made another hook and we had game point.  At the top, they checked the ball to my teammate, he passed me the ball and i faced my man up.  As i looked around, my teammate set me a screen to my right, so i ran around it.  The guy who was defending my teammate didnt step out, so i had the open shot.  Then i set my feet, aligned my shoulders, elevated and released the shot at the peak in one smooth motion.  As soon as i shot it, i knew it was cash... so i watched as the ball floated into the net (not touching the rim), bounce off the net and roll slowly to our feet.  Another victory for Warren... tho i wasnt all that proud.  My friend from school had bad coordination, and wasnt nearly as skilled or experienced as i was (no offense).   His bro was alrite, i'd say just as good as my teammate, maybe a little better.  After running throught the fountain twice and going home to get some water, i came back to another game.  3 ppl had come, one very tall one and 2 brothers.  We started a 4v4, and i was assigned the tall guy -_-.  He was about 6'4, 200 lbs, and muscular build... kinda intimidating.  He was the most talented of the 3 ppl who came, he was slightly quicker than me, but the height advantage was the real killer.  Luckily, he was also not too quick, something i took advantage of.  Time for Warren's shooting zone...  Well, finally the game started.  I started off slow again, i missed a few layups... theres no excuse for it but that tall guy kept on intimidating me, making me afraid of getting blocked.  Then the other team was up about 8-6, and i decided to step it up.  I started running around more, giving up on playing big and concentrating on getting open.  My man underestimated my shot, so i set up on the outside waiting for the pass.  When the ball touched my hands, my mind went completely blank, it was just me and the rim, nobody else was there, no pressure.  So i took it like i did during my shoot around, releasing the ball at the peak.  I took joy when it released my hand, it felt right as soon it took flight, i knew it was money.  The next play, i set a backdoor screen for one of my teammates.  The oppenent didnt see it coming, and he got completely stopped in is tracks.  As my teammate ran around to the other side of the court, his man tried to catch up.  Then i turned towards the top and found the ball at my hands.  There was a miscommunication and no1 picked me up.  "Just me and the rim" i thought again... swish.  10-10 .  As they checked the ball, i stood under the rim, comtemplating which side to run to.  When my teammate got the ball up top, another one ran towards me, so i ran around him, attempting to mix up our defenders.  At this time my team noticed i was hot, so they got me the ball.  I stood slightly to the right of the top of the imaginary arc, dribbling the ball casually while keeping my head up as to not miss any easy passes into layups.  Screen left, i ran around, my man got caught behind.  As i ran just inside the elbow, i stopped on a dime, set my feet, and hit a clutch pull-up-almost-fadeaway jumper... nothing but air (we dont have meshes >.  After a 30 min break, having 2 ppl join us, and after me and the guy who guarded me were assigned captains and chose teams, the rematch was ready.  But this time i started on fire.  After running from one baseline to the opposite one, i was open for a shot.  No hesitation... another point.  2 or 3 big open jumpers and my team was up.  My 1st draft pick was also playing well, he had an usual fake which seemed to keep on working.  A few points later my team won another close game.  3 vics.  The person who sat out the last game took off IMO the worst player on the other team.  He wanted to play wit my #1 pick so he and my worst player switced.  As soon as the game started i could feel the rhythm my team had going the last game disappearing.  I was the hot shooter, but that didnt stop the new guy from jacking up some ugly bricks... one went in tho, off glass... fluke.  I continued running around trying to get open as i did in the last 2 games.  Finally i did got an open shot.  I missed it, but that wasnt what bothered me.  As i landed, i noticed that i ever so slightly pulled my left calf.  It didnt bother me too much, but the next shot i took and missed magnified it 2x.  My man, who is a tough cookie to stop, decided to drive and lay it up over me.  I did what i could: stayed with him as best i could and jumped as i put my hand in his face.  As i landed, my left calf hurt worse.  This came down to the wire.  10-10 again... win by 2.  We had exchanged a point or so when my teammate gave us the lead with a runner in the lane.  My man was getting fustrated and he switched with his friend.  THANK YOU!!! Some1 small!!!  As soon as the ball was checked i set up in the post.  The ball handler made a good feed to me and i started to back my defender down.  As i gained a few inches, he started to push harder on my back.  All going to plan.  I made one last push to the rim, and my man pushed back.  As soon as i felt this, i dropped my left foot behind his feet.  Then i spun off him, using his own pressure on my back to throw him off balance.  I was off balance too, but it was a shot i was used to.  Elevation... then i smooth one handed follow through... and the game was ours!!!  But as i went up i felt a slight twitch in my right calf.  As i came down that tickle turned into excruciating pain... tho it wasnt as bad as SnoCamp.  My team started to celebrate while i leaned against the fence in pain.  Finally some1 asked what happened, and i told them between grunts of pain that i pulled my calf.  Sadly my friends who had just arrived had next game, but i couldnt play against them.  O well, i was happy 4.5 hrs of ball, 4 wins, but most importantly... i got my mind off what was bothering me all day.  Not that i dont care about it, but during a ball game, u havta concentrate if u wanna win.  U have to always keep ur head up, looking out for open cuts, screens on teammates or set by them, defensive miss-matches, open shots... everything.  But i felt at peace the most when i got the ball for an open shot.  Nothing matters, just me and the rim... one fluid motion... clean follow through.  That time, when u are at  that complete peace, cannot be replaced.  U are not concentrating on anything but the game during the game... unless u wanna lose.  Everyone has to be on top of the game, even the slightest slip could cause the game.  Anyways, i accomplished what i wanted... i was happy.  After painfully limping my way home, i got on the comp.  I opened my blog and then my template.  I wanted to customized it, to make it seem more personal, something that better reflected me... i changed a few things in the end: my font, how wide it was, the "posted by" comment, and that pic up top ^.^... all i need to do is find a good background colour, a good font colour to go wit the background, a border around the body, and possibly some links to my friends sight.  But now that i've said everything that comes to mind, I cant help but think about that problem.  In my eyes it shouldnt be a problem, but ppl are... well... human.  I need not say more...  Hopefully my upbeat mood will last through the night... *sigh* who am i kidding...
