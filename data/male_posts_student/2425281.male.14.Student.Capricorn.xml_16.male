First there was the public holiday on Monday, where the Queen played no part in anybody's day off and I decided to dog Andy and buy wood (???). Then that assembly on Tuesday, where I ranted about RICE... come to think of which... COME TO RICE!!  Weekend, weekend. It's been a good one. Challenged to take God's word more seriously and spent more time reading the Bible and AWAY from the computer!!   And Andy, look seriously, your new layout's good. I mean you should see me trying to design a web page.. even Junwoo could laugh at me!! Trying to learn Photoshop myself at the moment. Oh, and check out the footer at the bottom of the page. (me!)  Hmm.. and yes. Ask me for my new email address. Don't want to put it up here just in case evil spammers are lurking on introspective...*darts eyes*  Anyway, I am sleeping too late and it's time I got some rest. So yeah maybe I'll blog during our science lesson tomorrow in class. Until then, later.
