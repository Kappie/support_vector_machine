I won't be able to do this again until the weekend or next Monday, because I am going to the mountains with my father.  Anyways, after riding about 11 hours in the car, I finally stepped onto my grandmother's lawn. Let me tell you, sitting in a convertible for hours on end can really wreck your legs. Well, at least I got some Coke and McDonalds out of it. Pfft.  But you see, I'm out of redneck country for a month and a half. And I finally have access to a high speed internet connection. Cit-Tele is too lame to make it cost less than $50 a month, so I'm normally stuck with dial-up.  However, I still have to do work during vacation (Me? Work? Hah.), such as being a roadie for my dad and mowing his girlfriend's lawn.  I'll post again as soon as I get the chance. Peace out.
