First, the Viagra ad's are really annoying, but then when I have to explain to my little cousin why everyone is smiling, well that just makes it worse.  Tampons I hate when they say stuff like, "It's sooo comfortable. It's like riding a bike." And they have disgustingly detailed (yet still vague) illustrations.  Breast enhancement mostly just because it's awkward when my parents are in the room and it says, "Increase the size of your breasts in half an hour!"  And then I'm watchin' TV one day with my family, then comes on this ad' with three girls at a beach and one says, "You're wearing a bikini during your period?" Then it goes into a series of things like, "Aren't you worried about bloating..." UUUGGGHHHH.  Now, those Geico ad's, those are funny. Like the one with the gecko doing the robot. Or the one that looks like a soap opera, and the guy says, "I've got some good news." Then the girl responds, "You broke up with Jessica?" "No, I just saved over 15% on my car insurance," she walks away, "I saved! I thought that meant something to you!"
