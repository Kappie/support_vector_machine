They have cable internet so I was able to play a nice game of Mario Kart with Chad, the project manager of  urlLink Warp Pipe Technologies , the best frickin' thing on this planet, at around 1/2 speed. It was the fastest game I've played.  We went to an animal adoption thing and adopted a dog. It was stray so we got to name it. I suggested Meat or Bone but everyone else said that Maddy was better.  My brother in law designed a tattoo for me. I can't get it put on but it looks cool. It's a Japanese character, but we don't exactly know what it means. I thought that a tattoo with "GONZO III" on it and then some Japanese writing under or after it would be cool.
