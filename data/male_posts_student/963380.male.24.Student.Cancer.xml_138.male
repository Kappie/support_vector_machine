Blogging seems to be developing into this very bizarre form of composition - it's almost like you can see a chunk of text and say immediately "That's a blog". They seem to be very tangent... er... tangential? Tangenital? (If someone gets off track and you whap them in the nads, have you just struck them about the tangenitals?) - Like streams of consciousness but it a more structured form. e.e. cummings with a filing system.  Leaping off on a tangent - that's another thing, segue's seem (seam? HA!) to be optional - I think the new direction for the US Space program is finally in the realm of "Promising" again. Mars has been the least successful venture that Nasa has undertaken thus far - shooting for the moon (again) is a slightly less lofty if necessary goal. We know we can land on the moon. We did before. However, the computers they had then filled rooms, now they fill pockets. Break out the bloody Saturn V's and let's get this show on the road again.  Crimson Skies is delicious. Non-Nazi-Nazi's are fun to shoot.  You may now return to your regularly scheduled whatever.
