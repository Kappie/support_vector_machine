(from outside) Flash: "HEY GIRLS, LOOK AT MY MACHINERY!" (lots of screams) (Flash runs into room) Flash: "Enter the man who has no underwear! Ask me why!" Group: "Why do you have no underwear, Lord Flash?" Flash: "Cos the pants haven't been built that'll take the job on!"  Yes, more classic comedy. Almost as funny as Jack going into school on an INSET day. And having fun. I DONT CARE IF IT WAS ART OR NOT!  Oh, and does anyone know what that song they sung just before the RWC final was?
