Tina actually responded to my blog..which I must now talk to her about...if you aren't her...you can probably skip to... *SKIP* 1.)Look at the date on that blog entry, it was created before I had talked to you about that.  2.)I realize I'm not being fair...why does it matter?  I realize you're not to blame...I'm not retarded!  3.)I'm done with trying to keep others happy, it fuckin' sucks alright?  **EDIT**4.)I said that I was hapy to see you happy, WAS.  I also said that I have to get over you, thus eliminating feelings I had for you, or feelings involving you.  **EDIT**5.)I'm over it by now.  I admit, yes, I was pissed.  I honestly don't give a flying fuck now.  It's over.  You obviously don't understand the concept of, this is how I feel right now at this moment in time, not forever. (Not trying to diss)  Even though you seem to be farely good at it yourself.  Things are kool now.  *UN-SKIP* ...about here.  Now, where was I...  Just saw Spiderman 2 for the third time, and I must say, everytime I see that movie, it leaves a deeper impression on me.  This time I saw it with Rus....Carly and Rusty.  Ladies first. XD  Anyway, it's a good frickin' movie....and if you haven't seen it, you should.  **BATHROOM BREAK**  ah...I feel better.  While I was up there, I was reminded of a an old favorite CD of mine.  Pokemon 2.B.A Master, what a great CD.  So I grabbed it and plopped it into my Computer...and am now listening to it....that doesn't sound right.  oh well.  Hm...on with life.  Say you bump into sumone on accident, or accidently touch sumone.  What if they don't pull away?  Does that mean anything?  Had they noticed, and just hoped to keep that small bit of contact between the two of you for as long as you can?  Had they just not noticed it?  Do they even consider you to be important enough to notice you?  Are they here for sumone else?  What does it all mean?  "In my dream....I'm Spiderman, and I'm climbing these walls, but I keep slipping."  Ah, good stuff.  Man, if it's true that everyone is going through the same things that I am...well, not the SAME things...but similar troubles...BOY do I feel bad for you guys.  I forgot what I was talkin' about....I'll try to remember and update again. Peace!  Spense   **EDIT**  I'm happy for Keli.  She seemed to move past me pretty quickly.  That's good.  It's always kinda sad to see people not move on with their lives, not dwell in the past.  Not pathetic sad, but like....."sorrowful" sad.  Good Job Keli!  That is all.  Spense
