Fuck that. I  don't want to go and I can't go back until I'm done with HS here.I got my SAT  results today and I received a 1200, I guess that's good, but I don't really  care. I don't even want to write in this today, but I'm trying to write no  matter what. I guess you can tell that I'm disorganized and just pissed off. I  don't give a fuck right now. And of course, as soon as I reach work I get pissed  off because it is pointless and feel that no one would care if I don't fold that  one Thundercats shirt all messed up and on top of the Superman. who cares. on  the plus we helped out Micah, from Spencer's, Dog fund. His dog is dying of a  tumor and so we decided to havea little donation cup thing to put change  and shit into. He's a good guy. On Katie watch: haven't seen her in three weeks.  Anyways, when my parents came by later to work to talk to my boss, who they're  friends with, and drop off a cinabon, I tried to stay as far away from them as  possible. I don't know why I can't stand them, they're good people and want  nothing but the best for me. But I won't have it.oh, well. Earlier in the day,  before work, I talked to Danielle Mirabal, a friend, who I haven't talked to in  about a month. I haven't really talked to anyone in over a month. I've lost  touch of people. I have a lot of acquaintances, some friends, but no best  friends, ora friend that I would entrust my whole heart to. Danielle for  instance I considered to be one of my best friends, but look at it. I haven't  talked to her in about a month and she hasn't called me and I haven't called  her. why? who knows. I feel shitty. This journal entry is by far the ugliest  thing I have ever written or read...except for basically everything on George W.  Bush's website. that's pure bullshit.
