Hopelessly sick for three days in a row with hardly any energy to lift a finger and generating heat like a nuclear power plant, yeah, I was just there...lyin' around, trying to get those weird voices out of my head. But look on the bright side! Oops...wait...what bright side...Oh no matter, a great day in band tomorrow will definitely cheer me up. I can't wait to see all my pals and tap that ol' drum of mine. *yawnz*...hm....those antibiotics are really deep. Well, gotta go shake them off with a can of beer...hehe...just kiddin'. See ya!
