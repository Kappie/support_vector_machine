I figure that that might be a good a place as any to meet up. Her cousins supposedly teaching her how to skate tommorow.  I should really start that up again. Maybe if she picks it up Ill finally have someone to skate with! Im so glad we share the same kind of political veiws. Its so hard to find a girl in this place that isnt a total right wing hawk. The more I get to know her, the more I want to meet her.
