Work on this whole immense poverty thing, and Duke, stop paying half of your workforce minimum wage just because you're the only real employer in town.    No double doors this time...no renaissance birth.  The room doesn't mean as much to me...the campus, maybe...the quad is brilliant.  I'll look back quite fondly of this place, hopefully to come back in three years and regail this blog with stories of the past that are currently stories of the present/near past.    Life.  My own again.  Intriguing.  What will I do with it this time?
