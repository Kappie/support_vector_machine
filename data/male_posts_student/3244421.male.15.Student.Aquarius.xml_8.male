(It kinda looked like BBQ sauce lol) Even the rolls and the salad was really good.  The best part of the meal was the desert!  CHEESECAKE!!!! muhahahahaha, it was so good.  I was in a way happy that the band directors didnt talk as much, but I kinda wished that the classes would have given them their presents.  All well, anyways....... The DJ was really good, I was suprised.  Usually DJ's are really bad, and they play crappy rap songs, but this guy played a little of everything, including some of my favorites. The dancing was lots of fun.  I was kinda glad i went single cause i got to dance with katie anyways. :)  It went by really quick, i couldnt believe that i was there for like 6 hours.  I guess its like what they always say.... "Time flys when your having fun."  Well that is all for now, please show me your opinions by commenting.  Lata  Peace! (he he Tim)
