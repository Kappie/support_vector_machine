Well, I was ready to leave in thirty minutes. I just can't sit still for two hours at a time. OK, there are some exceptions. Scott Somerville from the Home School Legal Defense Association gives some fascinating lectures. And I love LoTR. I could probably sit through all three movies in a row. As a matter of fact, I'm going to have to get some friends together and try that sometime. So email me if you're interested, and I'll try to work something out. Other than that, there is really nothing else I have to say right now. OH! WAIT!!! Bible study group update! It was awesome last night! We had over 50 people there! I think there had to be somewhere around 70 to 90 people there, but I don't have the attendance records to look at yet. But it was great to see so many fellow believers there. I mean, I had to leave all my Christian friends for 6 weeks. Most of them are in my homeschool group, and they are so cool. Think of them as your best friends. Times 50. They're always there for me if I need anything. Prayer, fellowship, support, etc. They're totally awesome. You hear that, guys? You all ROCK!!! But most of them are in California right now. So I can't talk to them for another 2 weeks at least. I was so blessed to walk in the doors of the room where we had the Bible study and see 10 people sitting there. "Awesome!", I thought. "There are more people here than I thought there would be.". Imagine my surprise as more and more people kept coming in, until the room was full of fellow Christians. It was incredible! Our God truly is an awesome God! I love all of you guys. That includes the girls too. For me, "guys" is usually a gender-neutral term. More to come later.
