So, intead, I'm going to review Cubis, a game that I've loved for a while.  This one is highly addicting, but doesn't deliver the same punch as Zuma.    The first con that I noticed is the loading time.  This loads very...very...very slow.  Maybe it's a Yahoo thing today, I don't know, but, I do know that its running very slow, and its not my connection for once.    Once you get into the game, your goal is to eliminate all the blocks on the field by throwing other blocks at them.  There is a grid, and you select which grid you want to send it towards, and it will stop at the end of the grid (or whereevr the blocks are on that grid).  It's really easy to maneuver, and this game is fun.  I don't have a problem with controlling this, but, other people that have played this that I have talked to don't like the control very much.  Sometimes the cube might go down into the wrong part of the grid.  You just have to learn to maneuver it better.  The control is really easy...in my opinion, at least.  There are several levels in this game, and each one is different.  You'll have fun getting further and further along, because it gets more challenging and blocks stack up.  While that isn't a problem, you have to get a certain amount of blocks cleared each round in order to move on.    urlLink    You have to remove a certain amount of cubes before you can move on to the next level.  urlLink     Overall, this game is insanely fun, and I'm going to keep playing even after I finish writing the review.  Definitely check this one out, it's one of the better games I've reviewed on this website so far, and you'll definitely love it.   Pros  +Nice interface +Gives you a tutorial, if you want it +Easy controls   Cons  -Sloooow loading time   Score  Fun Factor: 99%-A Graphics/Layout: 90%-A Speed: 85%-B Customization/Controls: 100%-A Final:  93.5%-A Gold    Up Next: Tip of the day- Finding Skins for Blogger, and today's daily wrapup.
