WOW am i excited for homecoming. me and brad will have to show out so hot of dance of moves on the floor for hours and hours. SO i really hoep u all are practicing all the latest moves and getting as pumped as i am because homecoming is gonna be amazing. just picture the croded, 100 degree dance floor that is at least two times to small. and then picture get low coming on, or yea or even a little lean back and picture the amazingness and energy of everybody within a hearible distance. then picture after the dance when your body is coated in a fine salty sweat and walking outside into the brisk air and as you load the bus you are in the best mood possible. i just cant take it right now i need to be at homecoming
