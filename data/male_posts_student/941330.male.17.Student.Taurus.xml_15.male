Don't worry Kat and Belinda, with your sponge-like learning abilities you'll be crazy good hurdlers in no time (almost as good as the Jennifers, perchance?)...and just so you know,   badminton is the devil.   I mean sure, Alex might do it...very enticing, eh girls...but you can resist!  Mr. Lott has been surprisingly pleasant this week. It's almost worse than if he were a jackass about things.  Today was my last lab with Melissa...so sad...  *TeaR*    My goddamn dad...absolutely ignores any good things I do or accomplishments in my life ("good grades? they could be better"..."you ran 2 miles for practice? ok"), and relentlessly jumps on me whenever I make one small error (he'll brush off the countless times I washed the dishes punctually, but if I'm late one night..."you're so selfish!   i think i need to send you to boarding school!  "). Damn I hate it.
