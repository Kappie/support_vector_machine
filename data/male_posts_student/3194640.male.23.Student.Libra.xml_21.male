I got my ethics quiz back from the other day. I didn't do as badly as I had anticipated. My grade still wasn't great, however. Thankfully the quiz we had yesterday on Utilitarianism was pretty easy. I'll be surprised if I missed any of the questions on it. He also included 10 points extra credit. I'm pleased that I at least had the chance to redeem myself.  Tomorrow we'll be having a quiz on Kantianism in my ethics class. We talked about Kantianism yesterday, but I was so tired that I just wrote down a few notes and page numbers. Everything else just kind of went in one ear and out the other. I'll be studying for a bit tonight.   If all goes to plan, I should be heading over to  urlLink Best Buy  after work to pick up  urlLink Wilco 's new album   A Ghost Is Born  (click link to preview) . I've heard that it's good (I haven't had the chance to preview it myself, unfortunately), but weird. I think I'll like it. This will be my first  urlLink Wilco  album. I only own certain songs that I bought off of  urlLink iTunes . I love those songs, so wy won't I enjoy this new album? We'll see...
