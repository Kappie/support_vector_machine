Ok, this guy named Brandon and I were goin out a lil while back, and we broke up..which is fine and all...b/c i'm cool with it! Well, i've liked him since like the 6th grade.and i still have feelings for him, and i mean, who wouldn't...likin somebody that long!..but, my feelings for him aren't like...be his girlfriend feelings, they're more like...ok, put it this way, the physical attraction is there...but, the chemistry isn't! Well, it turns out that my best friend..likes him. And honestly, that's fine and all..but, it hurts....bad...b/c she's my best friend...and i have feelings for him! I don't want to feel like this, honestly, i don't, but, I do, and i can't do anything, but accept them. And it's like, ever since she started likin Brandon, she's got no more time for me, and it hurts. Guys, (that means girls too); you just don't understand how important she is to me, and if i lost her, i don't know what i would do, but, i don't wanna say anything to her...b/c i would much rather me suffer than her suffer...anytime! And i was talkin to brandon yesterday, and was like..yeh, im a lil upset with Kasi, and he's like, why and i was like..b/c it's like..she's got not more time for me and stuff, and then, he tells her...the one person, i thought i could trust...tells stuff..and that right there hurt me...b/c he promised me that he would never tell anything i told him..and he did, so now, i can't talk to him anymore about stuff. And then, i've got another friend, jonci, who i love with all my heart!..she's like my other half!...well, it just seems lately, that we're drifting apart, and i do'nt know what to do to stop it!...i mean..i try talkin to her more.but, sometimes, she just turns the other way!..and corey...i love corey to death, but lately, we just haven't been clickin as good as we used to...and i don't know what to do to stop that one either! It's just crazy. And it seems like everybody's turnin against me. And, austin, my hot chocolate, yelled at me today, and i started cryin!...it was bad...b/c he's never yelled at me before...and i just..lost it..i went up to david and said ima cry..and he hugged me..and tears started flowin! i dunno what to do anymore..i mean..i guess i need to find new friends?..but, it's goin to be hard replacing the ppl that i love! But, on a happy note, i think i'm goin to go meet this guy from hillcrest this weekend....but, i'm not sure!...Maybe i could replace brandon with him...haha...i'm crackin up....sorry, that was mean....but, i could'nt resist....wow, that's one of the only times i've laughed today...thanks...but, i guess i better go now, bye bye....love, LaUrEn  Alrighty guys, i'm back, to tell you some more bad news! It turns out, that a girl named Kayla has been tellin ppl some stuff about me, behind my back, and it's really pissin me off....sorry to cuss, or whatever..but, it is! She's been sayin all this crap...about how i'm mad at kasi..and she's been sayin that one of my best friends is tellin her this..and everything..and then she's goin to get mad at me for somethin i said earlier today...ok, lemme tell you what happened:...ok, so, she went out with brandon's younger brother, Jordan, well she broke up with him and was like..i like brandon, and then...she goes up to brandon today, and was like...i don't like you nemore b/c i like jordan..and i heard about it..and i was like..haha...it crossed over on you..big deal..well, she goes behind my back tellin ppl that she's soo mad at me and everything..but, when i'm talkin to her..she seems like there's nothin wrong..and i'm sorry..but, if i'm mad at somebody..and they start talkin to me...then, ima let em know i'm mad at em..not necessarily by tellin...but, more than likely by my tone of voice..and it gets on my nerves..and let's hope that lauren doesn't get too carried away...but, i'm sure i'll be fine!...but, that's all the news i've got now..oo..and by the way..please don't think that all i think about is brandon..b/c it's not...honestly..it's just that he's the one causin soo much crap right now....hah.bye bye...Love, LaUrEn  Â¶ 1:53 PM "   Wow...just, wow.
