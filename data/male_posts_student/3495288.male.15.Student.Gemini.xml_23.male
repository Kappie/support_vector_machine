During CME lesson, i borrowed my friend's pen knife for the whole day. My friend kept asking me not to do so again but well during the whole day, i did it. This time i could not feel anything. There was no pain. I felt as if i am already dead but my soul is still in the body it self. Today i did only two small scars on my left hand. Well i just let the blood flow and not care about the amount of blood flowing out of my arm. I was totally out of my mind. Couldn't stop my self again. This time it wasn't about Ash. Its something else which i do not wish to say here. During english class, had to do a review. I did a movie review on  MONA LISA SMILE . Since there were a few technical difficulties in saving the project into a cd i decided to type out a script according to a few scenes in the movie. I played as the main character, Katherine Watson. Many applauded for me as i did a very good job in acting but when that Mr Bouncy Bruce gave the marks for my presentation he gave me a very low mark. I feel like throwing my text book at him and script at him. The effort i put in so much and dedication to do such thing was a waste. Stupid lah! next time i don't want to do group work anymore. Do the project as an individual. Now adays no one cares about me. My parents and i are still angry at me for going to school late, my stupid Malay teacher doesn't care what my reason was for not bringing the stupid Malay Storybook!, My friends in classdid not stopped me from doing such stupid stuffs(so YAY! can do somemore!) and finally i am always being Neglected by alot. There is something i would like to stress to the guests who have been coming to my bloggy this past few days. If you know about this blog, this means you know about my secret so i would like you all to just  Keep Your Mouth Shut and Don't Mention About My Secret , to those who just joined in the fun well yes! I am GAY! You got a problem with me being  GAY?  Me being gay have not troubled your parents or your life right!? Well so just  SHUT YOUR MOUTH UP OK!  So what if everyone knows that i am gay but do you have to  SPREAD IT AROUND AND MAKE IT SO OBVIOUS?...  I think next time i hear some one saying me gay, i'll come up to that person and say it in his face. If the person beat me up,  BEAT ME UP TILL I DIE ALSO CAN I AM READY TO DIE ANYWAY SINCE NO ONE REALLY CARES ABOUT ME.   Well till here then... if you think this is too much well then wait for more of my entries ok. Bubbye.
