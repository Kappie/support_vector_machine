He is here in Perth studing architecture at uni.I asked him once how uni life is like and he told me that architecure is horrible. Lectures only last for an hour each day (starts at 8.00am) but you will stay and do work at uni until around 6.00 pm. This guy also seems to know a lot about Malaysia and it turns out that he used to live there. Wierd guy.He told me and my friends that once, he tricked one of those Malaysian cops on the highway. He was caught speeding and the cop made him pull over. As we all know, it takes very little to get some Malaysian cops to "forget" about your driving offence. This specimen was asking for some cash but since it was a highway he decided to give Matiu his book i which he keeps his bookings. Now this Matiu is a smart guy. He took the book, opened his wallet took out a 50 ringgit note . The not so clever cop looked around to see if anyone was looking and Matiu took advantage of the situation and slid a 1 ringgit note instead of the 50 ringgit note inside the book. The cop took the book and got on his motorcycle and drove off. I can imagine the look on the cops face when he found out he got tricked.Probably could only buy a "roti canai" for lunch. HAHAHA.  I'll blog more about the champions i have met next time i feel like it or when i am too free and have nothing better to do.
