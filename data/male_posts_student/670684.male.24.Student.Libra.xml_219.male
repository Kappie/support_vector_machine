Three days of grabass, travel, sweet redemption, travel, and new beginnings.  But I do get ahead of myself, because the story I want to tell is    Summer 2003 - The  Amazingly Amazing  Tour   Stop 6 - Bessie's Bend, KY   Family time on Monday set my trip back quite a few hours, enough so that I didn't arrive at Tiptonville, TN until 2:30 pm.  I was to New Madrid, MO at 1:30, but while New Madrid is closer to Bessie's Bend as the Crow flies, one must drive through Tennessee to get to this bit of Kentucky glory (my favorite bit of Kentucky - the sign as you enter that says KENTUCKY IS EDUCATION FIRST!)  What the hell am I talking about?  I'm talking about the geographical anomoly once mentioned on this blog, an oft-flooded area whose terrain was changed forever by the New Madrid earthquake of 1881, a former confederate stronghold that is now home to corn and odd men in trucks who wave at strangers.    Friends, we went to The Nub.    The Nub deserves a documentary film.  Its main claim to fame is that while other states either have waterway boundaries or quite straight lines, this bit of Kentucky is on the Tennessee side of the Mississippi River, almost an islet away from its mainland.  Kentucky paves the roads, provides the electricity...I don't know how schooling works for those kids in the three homes that are part of Bessie's Bend (the town of Bessie is a rusted-out shed and a turn in the road).  Its significance comes from a supply depot the confederates used when needing to ship goods to New Madrid.  Today that area is flooded out, due to the New Madrid earthquake.  Kentucky owns it, Tennessee uses it basically, and its history is with Missourri.  That, and freaks live out there.  A fat kid in a sleeveless black T-shirt pointed a gun at me, Bowden, and Missios.  We ate Godfather's Pizza at one of the nicer restaurants in town, a Amaco food mart.  An old woman offered to sell us moonshine at her shack liquor store.    Three hours is enough to get all of the Nub...from the levy to the mosquitos to the road signs to Tony's Chute (not Tony Shaloub).  But it's three of the best hours life can offer.     Back to Winston-Salem   I'd say I'll tell more about the road trip, but I won't.  A ton happened, I thought about a lot, I listened to a lot of Justin Timberlake.  I saw a lot of foliage and confederate flags.  But if I don't write about it today, I won't write about it at all.  And I am quite pooped.  I woke up at 3:30 this morning to drive out here.  No sleep since.  I will crash and enjoy it.
