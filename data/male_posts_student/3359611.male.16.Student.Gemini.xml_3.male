Then, after that, I've got my IT exam, and then we really enter into the fray, with English language, and loads of others in quick succession. 

I always thought that when it came to this time, I'd pull my act together. For two years, I have staved off all my worries about how little work I was doing with the soothing knowledge, that come exam time, I'd buck my ideas up, and do some serious fucking work. Unfortunatly, this has entirely failed to happen. I'm screwed, and I know it. I can see the end of tunnel, and the only light is one with 'YOU'VE FAILED' emblazoned on it. Fuck Fuck Fuck.

All the way through my school career, GCSEs have seemed so far off. The seemingly ulitmate milestone that we all have to pass, but you never think you will. They have always seemed so far away, a distant goal to strive for, but one that'll never happen. However, they are happening. They are round the corner. In my veiw, after these, childhood is lost. That sounds so fucking pretentious, but thats what it feels like. I mean, for 11 years, I have been at school, and in sight, just, all this time have been these exams, but they've always been so far away that any progress towards them is unoticable. However, we're there. All at once, they go from just something you think about every so often to RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW. And I don't like it... Mummy, I wanna be little again.....
