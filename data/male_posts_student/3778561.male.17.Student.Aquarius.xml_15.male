Now tonight I will be going into a fire at Dustin P's house that should be fun there will be a few people in there it will be good if the rain holds off. Now I checked The Weather Network and it said there is no precipitation expected for the next 24 hours even though it has been raining all day. So its hard to say whatb will happen I am just hopeing TWN will be right. Well we are having a family supper here tonight Uncle David, Aunt Tracy, and Aunt Theresa are all here well thats good. Well thats all I have to say for today. Until next entry.
