Oh, I forgot her Mom, who I am going to have an in depth convo with later...  MY MOMS an ass, and I told her that this morning. She's totally unsympathetic to my life in general, as well as life this week. I will be acting very British this week while the grandparents are in town, and my mom expects me to act like her perfect lil' bitch. NOT HAPPENING DUMBASS! I had lied to her  so I can get out of grounding for tonight. Lindsey is teaching me cosecants and shit for trig. FUUNNNN! I also have to apply at Aromas! FUN! I hope I work there, it would rock. This is true, the other half isn't.  Bean is tired, me fucking 2! Ledger Sucks, Life sucks, and I just feel like dying. I need a cigarette... How many humps does a camel have on the camel pack? One... I just looked at my pack...  If you read the blog, add a comment to this post with your location and how you found it, tell all your friends!  I feel sexy and beautiful thanks to pantenes pro-v frizz control treatment...
