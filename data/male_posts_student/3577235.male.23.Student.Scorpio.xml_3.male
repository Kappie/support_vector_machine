I can find a hundred sentences from all the books I read to point out that I am sick and perverted right now.  And I know I really need help.  But what I don't know is everthing.  I am lost,really seriously completely lost.  My mom asked me yesterday, could I see myself out in this world making my living.  I cannot answer her.  The only thing was fear when I heard the question.     My mind is blank these days.  I don't think anybody would believe me, neither am I!  There must be something in my mind!  I am just too scared to touch it!  I have to hold my cover in bed as someone I loved so dearly, then I can go sleep.  When I wake up, I was in desperation most of the time.  The only thing happens to be in my mind is I love her, I don't love her.  I hold my sheet tightly as she's in my arm, tightly against my chest.  I so want her to be by my side.  Such fierce longing.  But I have to tell myself that it is fate!  It is not true.  I know it's not.  Even now, just by tying about it, I feel heavy in my chest though I know exactly it is not real.  I'll stop now, before it get worse.    happy dreams.   NoNo
