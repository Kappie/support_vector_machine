[they said inside shopping mall cannot, but we are outside] haiz.. sian..then after a lot of detours [believe me A LOT ar!] haha.. we change location to Bugis via walking.. haiz.. legs all breaking liao.. then after 30-45 mins we reached there we gave up and gather in the Bugis MRT and sit there.. cos no one in singapore wanna but our flags... so sad leh! then the gers wanna meet up liao.. then we met.. and they wanna go shopping.. they like so excited.. walk so fast leh.. we went in parco bugis and walk for a while.. then return to the mrt station to sit, cos all so tired liao...   my reflection of this event: totally disappointed, no one wanna donate.. especially singaporeans. my collections mainly is from suntec taxi stand.. 1 thai guy, 1 englishman, and some others.. my female even kanna scolded by ppl.. haiz. see the attitude of our citizens.. haiz.. even a thai guy donated $2 to me and asked if thai baht can donate anot leh! but he blushed and walk off after he asked.. maybe paiseh bah.. BUT BUT BUT... wat are the SINGAPOREANS doing! totally disgusted by their reaction when they saw us.. we are not ghost/monsters/demons/or reapers leh! i repeat WE ARE HUMANS!! they saw us, all they either siam or they turn their faces away... only a few said they cant help.. its alrite wat.. if u dun wanna donate.. u can still walk normally wat.. we are not pointing gun on ur heads for donations?! if we wan like that we go bank better rite? haiz.. u dun donate ppl dun force u lah.. at least smile or wat.. dun treat us like outcast wat.. haiz.. overall i sold 6 flags and collected $9.70... my worst flag day yet...
