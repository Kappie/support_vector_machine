Ok...here goes...I just found out the Guidon OrSem and the STOA Fusion are at the same time, Wednesday-430-630 so its obvious that I can't attend both...  Wait...you don't know what STOA and Guidon are right?! A little briefing, there's this thing in Atenean Life called "Rec Week"...short for recruitment week...its like a small fair at colayco pav where orgs setup booths to give info to freshmen about their orgs and eventually ask them to sign up na rin, if their interested, for a price...um, maximum of a hundred bucks per org...  Basically, I signed up for three orgs...Guidon, which is the official student publication in Ateneo...Ateneo Debate Society (ADS), one of what I consider prestigious orgs...with them being Asian Champions, National Champions, etc. in debating...even with UP aroung...mind you, their tag line was..."Give us an award or contest in debate, we probably got it..."...well I joined for two things, one-the prestige and two-the oral training even if I have no debate experience (thanks to my good and nice school!)...anyway and last is GABAY, the org of scholars and is also a socially-oriented orgs that helps out little kids and teaches them and all sorts of nice things...  but there is no assurance that you'll get accepted for all orgs you've signed up for...so basically, they narrow down the applicants into the best they can have...unless their object is to train them...  I have an ADS essay to finish pa...and I'm not quite in the mood to right about politics...i.e. federalization of the philippines which is my chosen topic...I was supposedly going for the science topic but my view was different from what I expected my view  was...gets?! um...nevermind...ok...  Talk about school work...Cayanan gave us homework on Lit about The Hitchhiking Game...something like summarizing stuff or whatever...basta I haven't done it...might as well scribble it down tomorrow...and Doc Pest gave us about three readings yata...which, luckily, I have finished earlier...and I have this Math Long Test, which, hopefully, I will pass...though I have to try everything I can to scrape that passing score...If I'm lucky, I might even scoop a C+ or B...  So as I was saying...I have this conflict with Guidon OrSem and STOA Fusion...STOA is an org of DOST Scholars where I belong...It is pressingly important that I attend that, however, I still want to join Guidon...urgh sana di na lang ako nagsign-up dun...I saved a hundred bucks pa...anyway, I do hope I can untangle that knot tomorrow...  And ow shucks...film showing again tomorrow...and I do hope Raj is able to buy the protoboard for ECE 21...otherwise, I may have to skip the film and go to Cubao, Farmers to be specific, to buy that PCB 201 for soldering on Tuesday...  And I have to review pa...um...shucks...loads of things to do...I'd better just sleep...     ...ZzZzZzZz...
