Im sort of done with physics already, but i didnt memorise anything, just browsed through...im really screwed this time. Now im left with chemistry. The whole book. Im sick of this, i think i'll just leave things as they are, and go to sleep now, waking up tommorrow thinking everything will be ok. good nite.
