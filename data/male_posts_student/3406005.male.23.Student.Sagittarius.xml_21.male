This one featured Martin focussing attention on Harper's breast-beating statement made a while back where he claimed that Canada under his leadership would be unrecognizable. Martin's response is to claim that Canadians don't want the radical change proposed by "Mr. Harper, Mr. Day, or Mr. Manning."   Come on. Does the Liberal braintrust seriously think that anyone will respond to attacks against Preston Manning? Why don't they take a few jabs at Diefenbaker while they're at it?   Yes yes, I know. The idea here is to beef up the perception that Harper is a scary guy. Linking him to the Alliance and the Reform Party is a handy-dandy way to do so. But its time that Herle and Berle and Merle and Steve MacKinnon figured out that this approach has been a complete flop, even to my surprise. Harper just isn't coming across as threatening or extreme.   -------------------------------------------  On the topic of TV ads, I also caught Layton's new ad. Jack starts out by noting that, "An election campaign is supposed to be about ideas. Here are some NDP ideas to make a difference for you [or something, I'm paraphrasing again]."   Great! What with the other leaders just talking trash, finally we have the NDP to present some original, innovative ideas. So what are these shiny new ideas?: "improve health care...protect pensions...make government more accountable..."   Yeah, way to distinguish yourself Jack. You almost sound like Big Scary Preston.
