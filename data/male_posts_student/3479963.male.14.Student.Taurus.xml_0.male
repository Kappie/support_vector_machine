It was a promise that I made, but i was forced to make that promise. However the outing with them did not turn out well... Lol.. we boys crap the outing up...   the outing wasnt well as we didn't really had much to say. Both genders remained quiet..haha that was lame, fancy such things happens to secondary twoschool students..LOL~!!
