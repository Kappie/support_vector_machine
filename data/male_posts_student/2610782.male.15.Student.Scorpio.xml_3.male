So,the holidays are over and I ain't going to be happy ever again.Heard Roy has been studying 5-6 hours everyday and thats probably more than I have been studying for the  whole of June. Hyak hyak..............  Am sick since the day before yesterday,coughed up bloody phelgm this morning and I'm downing clorets every 1/2 an hour and sneezing cos of the mint and then causing further abrasion to my sore throat.  Damn,theres nobody online cos all of them are having training while I lie around at home.   Hey,the lion will lay down with the lamb ... and gobble it up when its hungry again!w
