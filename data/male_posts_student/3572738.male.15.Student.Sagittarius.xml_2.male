However to comfort me Bubba Ho-tep arrived today so I'm gonna take some joy in watching that tonight. Oh and I set up a Gmail account with much thanks to my sister for hooking me up. Kids on the streets today would be like "Yo funkdaddy. Thanks fo' that ghetto fresh smack. Werd." 1 gigabyte of free storage. It's lovely. So not much to talk about here today. I may pop down to the mall tomorrow. If I'm up to it. So uneventful is todays special word. Uneventful...AAAAAAH!...Yes I miss Pee Wee Herman's Playhouse. -Under The Weather Gavin There are no monks in this band.
