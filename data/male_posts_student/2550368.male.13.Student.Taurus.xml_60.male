We have to take 2 hours out of are days for two weeks evreyother day to do these waist-of-my-time-just-put-me-in-the-smart-classes test. There are always those people. Maby just one person but they are always there. THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE WHOLE FSCKING 2 HOURS! Most evreyone is done with the tests way early but nooooo there a person or two who are done. All had to do was draw out a design for nuke-board.com and well it looked better on paper than it did in photoshop sooo not sure about that.  CURRENTLY RAISED FROM BUYING UT: $32 NEEDED: $8 but there will be a $10 rebate for people who already baught UT2k3  Latter, Jeff
