If the number is greater than 99 it displays OOH. No reason, just a random interjection. Then, each time it repeats, it cumulatively adds 1 to the result so it becomes less and less likely to be less than 100. Once it becomes impossible to be less than 100, it stops. I'd write the code here, but I don't want to.   Also, if you're strapped for memory, you can archive the problem simulator and it won't change it's useability. Lots of fun.
