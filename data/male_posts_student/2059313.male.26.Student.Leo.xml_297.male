In the past two months (November 29 - January 29) the following number of blogs have taken place:  Posts about any girl - 7 Posts about a girl I like - 25 Posts about friends - 15 Posts about an event - 6 Posts about a TV show/movie - 9 Posts about school/classes - 5 Posts about a job - 7 Posts about worries - 12 Posts with quotes - 4 Other posts - 13   Some posts counted as two things... and the news articles I didn't bother counting.   A very interesting couple of months.  Thanks for everyone for all your advice, support, laughter, and patience.  Especially for your friendship!
