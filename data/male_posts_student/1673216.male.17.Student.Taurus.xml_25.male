And the other city that starts with a W tomorrow. THREE games in a row. What's that all about? I am already injuring from today....I will probably get injured more tomorrow. The good news is that I injured 2 players on the other team in the past two games...So anyway, we are going home and me Victor and Drew are just being total freaks. We started making the noise the Jackoffasaur makes (From South Park) REALLY loudly on the bus (and during the game, haha). Then victor starts doing the monkey noise, and I start screaming as loud as I can. Everyone starts cracking up, and me and Victor are screaming the monkey noises. It was SO loud. So I'm like HOWLER monkey! and I just start screaming really loud until my lungs run out of air...Then we recruit more people on the bus and we all open our windows. Next time we see someone we ALL just to make the monkey noise and scream and stuff. Monkeys are cool. So loud...Everyone is laughing...Oh man...we kept having to shift sides of the bus to scream at people on both sides. So insane. I'm such a freak.
