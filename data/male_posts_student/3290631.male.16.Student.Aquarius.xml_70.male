Then a couple minutes later, my mom knocks on my door and says, "Wake up."  And I'm like jesus christ wtfffff, and then seconds later it dawns on me: the weekend is over, it's time for school--at which point I rolled out of bed and got ready for school.  That should be classified as the WORST feeling ever.  I just figured I'd share that revelation.
