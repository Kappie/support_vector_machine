My hands are dyed permanently green and my foot's bleeding from pushing a lawn mower while wearing sneakers with no socks...  Sigh... Sometimes I just wonder, if Chinese food is so hard to cook and taking care of the lawn is so tedious, y do we bother? Sure we're born Chinese but that doesn't mean we can't eat other food and I don't c anything wrong with having a plastic lawn... Oh well...  Anyways, even though it's summer and i don't have anything to do, the simple day-by-day life is actually pretty interesting. Like today, (if u don't like sick stuff, skip to last paragraph) my ass bled... I've had this pimple on my ass for like two weeks and it's annoying when I sit on it. So anyways, I was scratching it and when I retracted my hand from my pants, there were like red stuff on it. I even tasted it to make sure it wasn't ketchup... Well, it sure isn't everyday that u can say "My ass is bleeding." =D.  Now... I gotta go cook :'(. Grr, I wonder if I'll survive the summer...
