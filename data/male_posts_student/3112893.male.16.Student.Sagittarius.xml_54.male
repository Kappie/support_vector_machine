So, I was called here today to write a story about a fish and, what the note apparently says, a marmot. The only thing is that I don't remember ever having a funny story or experience, or even someone else's funny story or experience to share. I don't remember having one. Period. New sentence. And so, comma, with that said, comma, there will be no story told. Period. New sentence. There is no story. Period. New Sentence. There's nothing more to see in this post except a signature, comma, so... Short pause. sorry :-\. Slantface. Period. New sentence. I'm sure you'll find something to do on the net other than read a story about a fish and a marmot. Period.  That is all. Period. -- Feanor
