The picture itself doesn't mean a whole lot to me. It's a picture of Mike James and his daughter at a press conference announcing the player's signing with the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks.  Go Bucks. They rule, and stuff.  What struck me was the background. I've seen the Bucks' logo a million times, but for some reason, the purple and green set against a background of black with a luminesence to it really reminded me of one of my favorite childhood places. If anyone had been looking at me at this moment, they would have found a really odd portrait of me looking in child-like wonder at a picture of a newly-signed basketball player.  The Oshkosh, Wisconsin Public Museum is not one of the best museums on the face of the earth. I haven't been there for the better part of ten years, and the last time I was there they were remodeling. My grandmother was a member of the museum's hierarchy is some form another, so I went fairly often when I was young, and there's always been this one part that's stood out in my mind for the longest time.  On the second floor, coming down an old oaken staircase from the third floor, sat a collection of old stained glass. The glass in itself was not especially important. What was striking was the surrounding lighting, which created what I now know more as a rave-ish atmosphere of crystal and glass, backlit and shown through with shades of greens and purples and oranges and reds. Not particularly historically interesting. Brilliant to look at, especially looking back at it.  Every once in awhile, I'll remember something like this from something long lost that I'm likely never to see again. It makes me sad, in a way, but also happy that I remembered it.  Little things spark it, like a picture, or a smell, or a feeling.  I don't like to romanticize the past because dwelling there is unwise, as I've been told many times.  I do think it is good to learn from history (especially one's own), and I wish I did more of it. I'm not saying that I could learn anything directly from this memory - it's just cool looking stained glass. I don't even know if it is still there. What I am saying is that, for both of my readers, if you remember something like this that you cherish, or wish you cherished, try and hang on to a little piece of it. It'll be worth it, because you'll never know when you'll need it or want to hang on to a little piece of what used to be you.  I have lots of memories from my hometown of Oshkosh, and that museum is a pretty big part of it. I regret not going there when I've been back, and will make a point of it next time. I'm lucky because I might be able to reconnect with this memory. Sadly, that's not always possible.
