Before 1st period, I have band. 1st period is the college math class, then I have the college spanish class, then AP Calculus, then Honors English, then Bible, then the college english class, then chorus. So, two math classes and two english classes. I don't mind the math so much as I do the english. My psychiatrist increased my meds. The way he was talking, it sounded like he knew that what he had me on wasn't going to be enough, that it was just a trial run to test for side effects. Wish he'd have told me that instead of acting like I really didn't have a problem. Hey, I'm sitting here peeling skin off my shoulder. As if I didn't have anything better to do. Which I do. I have to write up a flyer for the spaghetti dinner fundraiser for my mission trip. Then, I have to go distribute these. what fun. I hate talking to strangers. Especially because it's awkward to go into a place of business, and tell them you're not looking to buy anything, but to sell them something. then there's the problem of collecting the money. Since I'm doing this by flyer, it will be a little trickier. I'll just have to manage.
