I also received a $200 scholarship last night from the  urlLink Woodbridge Garden Club  for creating their website.  Well today was okay.  It was cloudy most of the day and we had the Senior Picnic.  I interviewed my friend Brandon about the picnic via cellular phone (see post below) to see how he liked it.  Well listen to it and you will find out.  I only was there for like 20 minutes and went back to shop... So it was sort of bad.  As I was coming home from school I almost broadsided this old man.  He just pulled out right in front of me on Bordentown Avenue in Sayreville.  I had to hit the breaks so hard to not hit him.  Well so hard that it left marks on the freshly paved pavement! :-P  I don't think he had a clue what was going on.  I was on my horn and he didn't even flinch about his bad judgment.  Anyway  "Peace_to_TheBrokenCrew_you_all_leet"
