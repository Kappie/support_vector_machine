Yo yo papa Click in da hizzouse. Uhh, there's nothing else to say. Dustin's grounded again apparently. Oh, and by the way, Dustin forgot to mention that the Alex pic and caption was by Aleisa. Duh, Dustin. I like that picture. It makes me respect Alex and what he does in a new way. Three cheers for Alex! -L4C13
