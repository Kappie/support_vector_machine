Haha, but I still managed to concentrate during tt 1 and a half hours of tuition, so it wasn't tt bad.  I went out wif my family during the evening to Peninsular Shopping Centre. There was this shop tt sold a pair of Adidas shoes tt I realli like. It was actually $110+, but it was on sale at $79.95, so I decided to get it as I've been eyeing on it for quite some time already. The main colour is black and the stripes are in white. It looks pretty good to me. Hehe.  We went to Funan Centre next. My dad bought me a Sony Cybershot 4.1 Megapixels Digital Camera!!! OMG! L0L! Since all Sony digi cams were on offer now, I managed to convince my dad to get me 1. At first I juz wanted the 1 tt cost $399, but my dad figured out tt the $549 was cheaper in certain ways, so he got tt for me! Isn't tt great? Haha, I managed to lower the price down to $515! Tt's even betta! L0L! The digi cams were already on promotion, but the salesman still managed to lower down the price. How nice of him! L0L! Well, the shop was "Song Brothers" on the 2nd storey of Funan Centre.  After tt, we went to meet our relatives at this restaurant in the Esplanade. The food was damn expensive and the quality of it is onli so-so and not worth tt much. Also, the portion served was miserable. Tt was how I felt. We went down to a cafe later juz to relax and chat. We chat till like about 10pm b4 proceeding home.  We reached home like 11pm. I took a quick shower and went to create a quiz on the net. This quiz is basically about how much u guys truly noe me, so pls visit it and gif it a shot. After doing it, u guys will noe how much u all actually noe about me.

Tt was realli shitty! The next match is Czech Republic vs Holland and my bet is on Czech. They hafta win or else I'll lose another $10! L0L! Alrite, I'll stop here. Cya~! =]
