I dunno but i can connect so much with SpineShank. lol people never ehard em thought tehy sucked, heard 'em, to the reaction of Shit, this is really good!  i think this is one of my fav. songs.   Feel the tension of rejection Bleach it out with therapy The confusion exseclusion Turns into my deformity  Never trust it, maladjusted I've become my own worst enemy The aggravation in my fixation Keeps it all controlled inside of me  See it all collapsing, it's all around me This condition is killing me The isolation still surrounds me In remission but it's killing me  It's what I can't control What I can't control What I can't control in me  Born again I feel so hollow Torn again my senses fade Mourn again without the sorrow Born again without the blame  Force a new sollution, it's all inside me In remission but it's killing me Evolution is divided In remission but it's killing me  I can't increase the treatment It won't suppress the feelings Or stop the way I'm getting Used to the pain  Breaking down Self-destructive pattern    Another day, another post.
