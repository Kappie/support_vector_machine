They are off of a 1995 Chrysler Sebring.  They are chrome 16inch.  They should do for now.  Better than the steel wheels that are on it now.  I got the Sebring set of wheels for $200 with tires.  Later today I went to our mechanic's shop and told him my plans with the car.  He will be doing things such as transmission work.  He says that he knows a guy that can fix my transmission that I have.  I would rather do that since I've already spent money on the transmission I have and know it has good cluches and new parts, just needs the bands worked on.  He also says he has a set of shocks at his shop he was going to put on for me once but I never came over and had them installed.  So, once the wheels get here monday, I'll put them on and show a before and after picture. And I'll take it to get the tranny worked on.
