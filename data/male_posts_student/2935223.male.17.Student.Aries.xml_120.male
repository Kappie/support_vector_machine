I'm still pretty dazed after last night...I mean,  MAN  talk about a doozy.  I just "got done" mowing the lawn.  You're probably wondering why that's in quotations...but it is for a good reason.  Me being done mowing the lawn means, the lawmower that we're borrowing from Steve ran out of gas with a 1/4 of the lawn still long....:-S  ** EEP ** It took me a really long time to even get 3/4 of the lawn done, because I like cute little animals too much.  Everytime I saw a frog, I would stop the lawnmower and wait for it to move out of the way, not helping it move out of the way though....because that would make it weak and not be able to survive in the wilderness, and all his froggy friends would laugh at him because he was such a pussy.  Then he would grow up and have to go into froggy psychology!  That poor poor frog...  I think tonight I'm going to Harold and Kumar go to White Castle again...but I'm not sure, Jackie has to contact me and tell me if we still are or not.  Man, I sure do love Vindicated by Dashboard Confessional....you guys shoudl hear it if you haven't, and if you have, you should listen to it more...because without it, you are NOTHING!!!!  MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  I'm gonna go play sum DDR now....I love that game, I get such a rush from it.  I just go and play like 10 standards songs and 10 heavy songs...and by that time I'm all gross and sweaty, but....I feel better after doing it.  Then I go take a shower and read my  BATHROOM READER .  Oh ya, that whole goin' and playin' DDR thing....I should get on that. BREAKFAST?!?! BAH!  Who needs breakfast!  Spense
