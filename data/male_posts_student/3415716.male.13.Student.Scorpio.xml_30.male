The only problem I had was my watche's alarm isn't very loud so this morning I woke up at 7:45 and we're supposed to be at class at 8:00. Luckily I had taken a shower the night before and class didn't start until 8:15. Anyway,my summer is finally starting to end, but at least I get to go to Canada first.
