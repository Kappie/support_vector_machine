But in all justice, a claim this weighty cannot be argued by a farmer. I pray you sir, stop here: send him home and let him come again with a lawyer...   Now look you, Mr. Hale -    Your honour, I have signed 72 death warrants. I am a minister of the Lord, and I may not take a life without there be a proof so immaculate that no slightest qualm of conscience may doubt it.   Mr. Hale, you surely do not doubt my justice!   I have this morning signed away the soul of Rebecca Nurse, your honour. I'll not conceal it; my hand shakes yet as with a wound! I pray you sir,  THIS  argument let lawyers present to you!   Anyway, away from the world of Arthur Miller's Crucible, we enter the last night of sanity before a week of non blog. I wasn't expecting to be able to blog tonight, actuellement. Anyway, yeah, kinda pointless when I said all I needed to in my last one... peace, peoples.  Love, Jon Roskilly
