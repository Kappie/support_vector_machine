I have worn them before.  Anyway, I go into school today, and they are sending people to the office for flip-flop.  "Crap" I thought.  So to make a long story short, I had to call home and get other shoes.  Apparently flip-flops are a dress code violation.  Well if they want to pull "dress code" crap on me, let me pull it out on them.  On Tuesday, I am bringing a camera and taking pictures of other dress code violations.  It isn't really the sandal issue...It is those (excuse my stereotypicalizing) Gothic kids.  They were those  extremely  long chains and straps and stuff.  That isn't just a dress code violation.  They are brazenly violating the school policy. NO Weapons.  I know a lot of kids who feel the same way.  So I am thinking of a petition or something...It just really makes me mad.  I need to go vent or something....
