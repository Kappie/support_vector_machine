I finished all three readings but can't really contemplate on what the stories meant...well, I did absorb the whole plot thing but what about his quiz...do we get to explain the stuff about THE Plot or something...its a question about what to expect...so...wala lang...this IS my OC side...  And shocks...I forgot (but just remembered)...I have a CAD class on Monday so there is a great possibility that I may have to hurry to Berchmanns Hall if Arthur gives us an activity na...oh well, at least not from CTC to Bel...or Comm to SocSci...hehehe...  Oh well...
