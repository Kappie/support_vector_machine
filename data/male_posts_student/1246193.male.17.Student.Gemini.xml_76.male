I didn't realize how anxious I was to get out of the house and sleep under the stars until last night.  We camped, we cooked steaks, we burned half a truckload of band music (what do you expect...I was with David), we went four-wheeling, cleared a new and improved campsite, and discovered a den of baby coyotes.  It was an interesting evening to say the least.  When we realized that there was a coyote den a few hundred yards from our camp we got a little nervous.  That nervousness increased dramatically when we discovered that David's dog, Shadow, had decided to bring one of the baby coyotes into our camp and play with it.  We took it back, made our fire a hell of a lot bigger, and made some fire-hardened clubs.  Exciting shit, I tell you.  I came home covered in mud, stinking like smoke, cut up by thorns, and the happiest that I have been in months.
