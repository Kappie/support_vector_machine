As I sit here, just home from work(a farm, none-the-less) and listening to country music, I've come the realization that I am a hick. What the hell am I doing!? Country music sucks! Actually one song by Travis Tritt called "Country Ain't Country" is pretty good. I'd say go download it but i've heard "the law" has been cracking down on kazaa users lately. Most country music is just too naive and clean or just damn boring.   anyway...i'll be back with more rants in the future  asta la pasta (who cares, it rhymes)
