I feel angry that this person would feel that way towards me just because I feel compassion for others.  Yes, I may not display this behaviour in front of my 'friends' but that's only because I feel they would judge me, which is incredibly sad because they are, after all, my 'friends'.  This post may cause problems but I feel the need to express my feelings.
