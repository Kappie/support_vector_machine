O2b is just place where kids of all ages get to hang out. It has everything from preschool to homeschool. It has an afterschool program. A summer program. And even a spring break program. There are people who work there called counselors...Each counselor gets a group of kids of a certain age group.   When I  first went to o2b it was on spring break, I was 9 years old. We went to Wild Waters, this was when I first met Danny Z. Danny left a big impact on me that day. His humor and seriousness made him an instant favorite among the counselors. A couple of months later my mom signed me up for the summer program. I asked to be put into Danny's group. I had no idea that when I made that decision I was changing what my very future might become.   Each counselor has to teach their own class. Danny's class was Drama. One of the excersizes we did before we acted out scenes from scripts and such was Improv. I loved improv! In case you didn't know...Improvization is where you act out a scene or situation off the top of your head, but you always get something to work with, like a type of character or a certain situation.  The first class I had during the day was Science. And If i never chose Science for my first class, I never would of met the two bestest freinds i've had. Danny Good and Brittany Filer. Brittany and Danny were both my age. We shared the best laughs! One day me and Brittany came up with a song. It was a parody off the song Pretty Women and it is absolutely rediculous but we still sing it today!    Your mamas dishes! Walking down the street! Your mamas dishes! No they're not looking sweet! Your mamas dishes! "Karl.."   Mr. Seal, you guys shouldn't drink beer! Your mamas dishes! Yo mama!    Well. Every friday each class had to show a presentation in front of all the counslors and all the kids and all the parents on what they learned that week. Me and Brittany were aloud to sing the song in front of all those people. That was the first time i ever got a glimpse of the spotlight. Everybody was looking at me. The laughter...the applause...I loved it all! I've always loved being the center of attention but that was the first time I appreciated it.   Well anyway, the first year Danny left o2b, I went into Kims group. Kim took the role of drama teacher. Kim was the funniest little women on earth. She was a riot!   One day we where doing improv and I accidently said "finking" instead of "thinking". Everyone was cracking up! Kim asked what finking meant and a girl named Meagan Conlon bent over and said "Finking is when you grab your nose and stick you thumb up your butt!" Meagan was a very goofy girl! She's about two years older than me and a year older than her brother Eric.   That little word was the most famous thing o2b ever saw. Everyone was bending over and sticking ther thumbs up their butts!Me and Danny Good came up with a little skit that we performed in Drama about finking. Kim loved it so much that she begged us to make up a play about it. No script...Just practice and memory.  The plot was that I was filling up my car with gas when suddenly this alien thing (Danny) came up to me and asked me to help him take over the world by finking ...we were disturbed children... Beleive it or not! When we performed the play two fridays later...IT GOT A STANDING OVATION! It was amazingly funny! People were talking about it for days.  I got another taste of spotlight and I loved it even more. And I needed more... The only way to get more was to entertain...And i want to entertain people when i grow up. I want to make people laugh... Well thats why i want to be an actor...Now listen to my life story!
