Got a lot of free time today and have to focus that time onto my books.      This morning there was a phone call for me on my hp which was my Mt classmate and he told me that he wanted to invite me for his birthday party next Saturday and I told him that I would go but now I have no idea on getting him a birthday present... Sigh Well he is 16 and I think I should go and find out what he likes first..         >> Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future
