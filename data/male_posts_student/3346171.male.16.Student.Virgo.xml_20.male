I spent my free time thinking about somethings that had happenned in my life, I wish i could back in time and change somethings, not things that bothered me, but things that i did and bothered people around me. Well,that's why life is what it is, we never can just erase things. This week passed so fast, and it's not good at all, like Luciana said ( luciana is a lady who works at the gym) "I'll be in 30's and i didn't enjoy life", hummm... what is she waiting for? She said that but didn't change anything i suppose, maybe we should not think like her, there's no time for thinking about how fast life is passing, just do something.
