But still, I still can't get my thoughts off the big decision. My father called back yesterday, and he asked if I wanted to study in Australia. I was quite speechless, especially in the middle of my Smallville episode. But I decided to think about later and continue with the show. But somehow, I just can't watch in peace. So after the show, I quickly started considering. Currently, all seems good for me to go, nothing to pull me bad, plus, it's a great opportunity for experience and to quicken my studies. But think is that it just doesn't seem right for me to just decide like that. So I thought through again, and it involves alot on prayer and talking to others. I need to find out more about the environment there, and how things will affect my spiritual growth. Ultimately, I have to depend on God's will. It seems so appealing to go, but I think I need more time still. Sigh...but whatever happens, I still trust in God, and believe that whatever happens, whether pleasing or regretful, He has purpose for everything. Ok...gotta go...there's full day band prac tomorrow. Just hope I'll enjoy myself, and that I don't need to go thru the torture of trying to stay awake.
