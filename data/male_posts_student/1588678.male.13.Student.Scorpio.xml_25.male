She said that it's on the engine. The manager asked what is looked like. She said it was round and black and it said,  "710."  The manager stared and asked that the blond to draw the 710. So she drew the 710 and handed it to the manager . . .  Okay, unfortunitly I need this photo to finish the joke and to show what a 710 is, but I don't have blogger pro, so I'll just write whats on the picture and hopefully put it on this post.  . . . The picture of the 710 was an "OIL" cap upside-down. Hehe. Its more funny with the picture thou. Believe me, I'll get this photo on this sight,  for I am Suburban Myths!
