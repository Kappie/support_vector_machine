Grey are the sky and the water, Green the lost ribbons of reed-beds, Small in the silence a black shadow Floats upon wide pale mirrors.   year-start: 2002   The first few hours of this year I spent with Nick, Kira, Brian(my brother) and his friend Bryan, and MiMi.  We talked the new year in with a failed attempt to celebrate simultaniously with the rest of the time zone.  Canadian wiskey and potatoe chips where the first food of what will be undoubtedly be the most unpredictable year of my life.  Towards the closing in of sleep i was in the middle of watching Planet of the Apes around 3am.  I started to feel a little sick, like alchohol sick.  I stayed awake for a while longer; trying to get through the movie with out having to lose my chips and "salsa". "Maybe I need to lay down," I told myself.  I went into the room and undressed and slothed my way under the blanket, this didn't help, just made me realize that I needed to take care of this.  I was sober, to a point, and hadn't had a drink for over an hour, why was this belated.  RRAAAAAALLLLPPPHHHHH!.  I feel better now, finished the movie and went to bed.   Its almost like stabing your hand, you know its gonna hurt, but the rush, some say, is worth it.  What a stupid way to start the year.   By the way, Nick and Kira saw the canal rat moster thing last night.  what is that thing!
