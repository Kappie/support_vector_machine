NEVER.  ---THE MEXICAN      If you love someone you say it...you say it right then, out loud...or the moment just...passes you by.  ---MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING      "It's funny how we set qualifications for the right person to love while at the back of our minds we know that the person we trully love will always be an exception"  ---Ally McBeal --     I feel like the best version of myself when i'm with you... and that makes me doubt everything else.  ---KEEPING THE FAITH      I would rather have had  One breath of her hair,  One kiss from her mouth,  One touch of her hand,  Than an eternity without it...  ---CITY OF ANGELS    "Sometimes when you hold out for everything, you walk  away with nothing."  ---Ally McBeal    Fate exists but it can only take you so far, Because  once you're there, It's up to you to make it happen.  ---CAN'T HARDLY WAIT    You will see a lot of things,  But they will mean nothing to you  If you lose sight of the one you love.  ---AT FIRST SIGHT    "If two people are meant for each other, it doesnt mean that they are meant for each other NOW."  ---pacey, "DAWSON'S CREEK"    I guarantee it won't be easy. I guarantee that at one point or another one of us is going to want to leave. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine I am going to regret it for the rest of my life because I know in my heart you are the only one for me.  ---RUNAWAY BRIDE    Dear Catherine,  I'm sorry I haven't talked to you in so long. I feel I've been lost. No bearings, no compass. I kept crashing into things, a little crazy I guess. I've never been lost before. You were my true north. I could always steer for home when you were my home. Forgive me for being so angry when you left. I still think some mistake's been made and I'm waiting for God to take it back. But I'm doing better now. The work helps me. Most of all, you help me.   You came into my dream last night with that smile of yours that always held me like a lover, rocked me like a child. All I remember from the dream is a feeling of peace. I woke up with that feeling and tried to keep it alive as long as I could.   I'm writing to tell you that I'm on a journey toward that peace. And to tell you I'm sorry about so many things. I'm sorry I didn't take better care of you so that you never spent one minute being cold or scared or sick. I'm sorry I didn't try harder to find the words to tell you what I was feeling. I'm sorry I never fixed the screen door. I fixed it now. I'm sorry I ever fought with you. I'm sorry I didn't apologize more. I was too proud. I'm sorry I didn't bring you more compliments on everything you wore and every way you fixed your hair. I'm sorry I didn't hold on to you with so much strength that even God couldn't pull you away.   All my love. G.  ---MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE    "I love that you get cold when its 71 degrees out. I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich. I love that you get a little crinkle in your nose when you're looking at me like i'm nuts. I love that after i spend a day with you, i can still smell your perfume on my clothes. and i love that you are the last person i want to talk to before i go to sleep at night. and it's not because i'm lonely, and it's not because it's new Year's eve. i came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."  ---WHEN HARRY MET SALLY    You cannot find true love where it does not truly exist. And you cannot hide it where it truly does.  ---KISSING A FOOL    "Me? I'm scared of everything. I'm scared of what I saw, of what I did, of who I am. And most of all, I'm scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my whole life the way I feel when I'm with you."  ---DIRTY DANCING
