After surfing the WWW and its multiplicity of sites dedicated to things snow related, I'm today especially keen to explore how Aussie resorts manage to keep customers returning for more.  When it comes to annual dumps of the white stuff, lets face it, Australia doesn't really compare with the plethora of Alpine regions around the world. So what makes the Snowy Mountains one of the most frequently visited tourist destinations in the winter time?  One reason would have to be be Australia's position on the global map - we are relatively remote and access to quality European, American, and Canadian resorts can leave you with an empty pocket after it's all finished, so the Aussie slopes are the next best thing. Another is the allure of seeing snow in an otherwised sun-burnt, drought stricken continent. Maybe its as simple as just getting out of the daily grind  intoxicating stench of the CBD for the weekend. Whatever the reason, here's my take on it.. I've discovered that in alot of cases it doesn't matter how the snow conditions really are, people will always visit the Snowy Mountains in Winter. I know this becuase I've been to the snow for the last 4 years and during that time, none of the seasons stood out above the other as brilliant - in fact, all were pretty mediocre. But I still loved hanging in huge chairlift lines, scratching my board on ice patches, and dealing with bumper-to-bumper traffic on the way home. Why??? Who knows.   Snow is an unusual thing, man made or not. Driving in your car and seeing that first snowy peak kilometres off in the distance is an awesome moment. The size, appearance, and inspiring nature of the mountains create the overwhelming appeal for many to come back again and again (getting goose bumps now). Sure skiing and boarding are fun, but ask the first timers how their ass felt after getting on the slopes for a day and they'll tell you, "never again!!" - that's what I said! Yeah it hurts and can be embarrassing at first, but getting the hang of it is all part of the fun. Once you've got the knack, it's like the old cliche goes, 'just like riding a bicycle'. Which is rubbish cause I think snowboarding is easier!!!   Snow and the activities around it represent something pure and unspoilt by the modern globalized world. Time spent on the snow is your own, it's free from invasion of personal space and privacy. I compare it alot to surfing. For those of us lucky enough to experience a trip to it, a snowy mountain adventure is something that stays with you forever. For those who haven't experienced it yet, plan your leave, save some flow and get there....you won't regret it.  CARPE POWDA!!! seize the powder!!.
