My oratory isn't due until the last day, though...but I still need to work on it.  so ha.   Anyways...my friend (the one who burned me the CD and told me to rent the video) told me this morning that the Producers we rented last night was the only one.  I'm super sorry guys...I was looking for the songs.  SORRY!  lol and sorry for yelling so much...ya'll just wouldn't stop talking!  GOSH!
