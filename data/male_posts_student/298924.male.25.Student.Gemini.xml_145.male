Never let anyone tell you that being a 23 year old black male, starting your second year in medical school equates to being a success....nope....not when "it's your responsibility to take care of your father"....when you feel pressure to give large sums of money to family members please follow through because when you don't "you are a liar and God hate's liars"....I wouldn't want to piss God off any further....I mean look at my life now....  Anyway yesterday I had my first class of my second year....I had heard all sorts of things about the professor of my behavioral sciences course....what i found out about her was she has a vocabulary that is off the HOOK....she used $20 words like she had a million dollar budget in her mind....of course I believe she doesn't have any synonyms for the word germaine (she used it at least 10 times in describing the course) but she can't be perfect I guess.....all in all I think I am going to enjoy this course....maybe it will help me figure out what is wrong with me and my family....  I gave serious thought to doing a sort of "Life Story of Cal" in five parts on this here site....but I'm going to hold off for now....I think I'm going to write a script instead....see where that takes my mind....how exactly does a medical student find the time to write a script?.....that's part of the fun I do believe.....  No class today....so I'm turning today into Movie day....it seems that in my latest DVD purchasing binge I have forgotten to watch most of them (imagine that....buying 10 DVD's in 2 weeks and not watching ANY of them)....I watched Primal Fear this morning....pretty good movie.....not great.....but I was satisfied....Magnolia is on now.....I'm letting it reach the point where I left it on during my last attempt....I will also be giving Vanilla Sky a THIRD audition as I have fallen asleep the past two attempts to watch it....from that point i will play it by ear, although I feel compelled to watch Braveheart, given all of the criticism I've taken for having not ever seen it....  Yep....this is the life I live....
