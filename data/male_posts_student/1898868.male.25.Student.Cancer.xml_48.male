I'm quite happy with the friends that I have now and am sure that I'll be busy enough with skool that finding dates via the friend-friendly Friendster friend-finding fructose-limited network isn't my style. Sorry, dute but maybe later.  Stasi, this is in no way a cut at your expertise on the web-wild ways of wowing the chicas (or cuban guys). For now, I'm a romantic and have my heart set on one girl and...well, we'll see.  p.s. Bagel, I know there are hot young ladies with intellect in the city of brotherly love. Philly.com said that the dance club Shampoo is the hip place to boogy and libations around town lean toward "colorful concoctions with silly names and fruity tastes." In other words, you'll love the neo-soft slant of Philly.
