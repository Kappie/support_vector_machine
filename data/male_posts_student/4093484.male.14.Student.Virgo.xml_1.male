       
      Welcome to this, this  thing.   Apparently I can type things, and they will show up here.  I can also post pictures, if the need be.  Neat.  First things first, a little background.  Why did I make this?  Over the past couple months, I've always needed an outlet to write, share things I find interesting, or pretend people read this.  If you  do  happen to stumble across this, feel free to leave a comment.   What can you expect from here?  I'm bound to post anything I find interesting or amusing, or if I feel like saying stuff.  I usually try to keep up with games, technology, and  other people.   There will be no set dates as to when I post something new, or something  worthwhile  for that matter.  Why not LiveJournal?  To tell you the truth, I don't really care for LJ.  I certainly don't have anything  against  it, it's just that I have a neat little button in my browser that  just so happens  to let me post about a website, but this feature is only for BlogSpot, so there you go.  Also, this service is a lot more pleasing to the eye than LJ's monotone colors and rough edges, isn't it?
