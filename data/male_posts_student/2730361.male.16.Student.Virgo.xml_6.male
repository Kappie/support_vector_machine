Today in english i heard a couple of songs from a christian band. I do not normally listen to this kind of music but the two songs i heard today were some of teh most beautiful songs that i have ever heard. I speak of the beauty of the song not in the beauty of the words or even the sound of the music i am speaking of the feeling behind the music and the general feeling of hope and love behind it. It was a group that i will assume makes music that sounds similar to the type of sonfs that Eminem produces. I do not listen to him either so i would not know. But the feeling of the song was one of hope for the salvation of a soul that they believed was lost but still had the chance to come home to its maker. It also expressed a feeling of great respect for Eminem as a man but a feeling of sadness over the kind of role model that Eminem is giving all of the young people of america. This song is the pinacle of what i see as good in the christian faith. Many of the things that different parts of the christian faith evangelize I do not believe in but this is the sentiment that I believe each and every person should follow no matter what religion, race, or other beliefs they are. This sentiment is one of a godly manner. If every single person in the world followed this we sould have solved a lot of our problems by now and we would not have to worry about the global terrorism we fear or worry about many of the crimes that we have in abundance now. Keep in mind if you reread this article that i am not one to talk. I judge people, I hold grudges, I am a perfect example of the inherent flaw in the human system or in other words someone who can talk but cant quite back up what i say with words. While i try to be the best person i possibly can you can ask any of my friends that i have known and they will tell me i am one of the most flawed people they have ever met. But I do not say that i am perfect though it may seem that that is how i come off. I want to tell anyone who thinks like this band and especially all of my friends that share this bands ideals that they dont have to change, they need to spread that feeling of love for your fellow man no matter what they do. You are the people that I have the greatest respect for because it is they who hold the hope and they who hold the greatness of all man
