Many of you know that Wyoming is a very conservative/Right-Leaning state, so you would NEVER expect to see a protest against the War On Terror/Operation Iraqi Freedom here would you? That is where you are wrong, my friends. There is a man, and I use the term "man" very loosely, who, every Friday from 4:30-5:30PM, protests the War in Iraq. Now, this is all fine, it is his GOD GIVEN right to stand out there, and I'm not going to stop him from going out and putting that right into action. But there is one thing about this "man" that most people in the small down of Douglas, Wyoming are very ashamed and embarassed of. He is a cross dresser. He likes to walk around town in tu-tu's, tennis-skirts, cheer-leader outfits, and any other kind of skirt that shows off a little bit of leg. But, again, this is his right, and I'm not going to stop him from looking like a freak.   For the first 2-3 months that he did this, he was alone, he had no supporters with him, nor did he have any opposition. One Friday afternoon though, this all changed. Fed up with having this "mans" Leftist and immoral ideology shoved down my throat everytime I drove down center street, I, yes I, decided to take some action. I went out there with the only sign I had at the time, and that was a "Support President Bush and Our Troops" yard sign. It wasn't much, but I got my point across: Sissy, as he likes to be called, had been challenged, and it was from a 16 year old High-school student. Sissy, was not a happy camper.  For no less then an hour, I was called "Nazi" "Fascist" "Imperialist," by the man they call Sissy, while the people of Douglas gave me thumbs up, honked there horns, and some even pulled over and shook my hand. The show of support for me angered Sissy even FURTHER, and he went from attacking my politics, to attacking me personally. I went from "Nazi" to "ignorant boy who knows nothing of politics," from "Fascist" to "Brainwashed fool" and from "Imperialist" to "racist against Arabs and Muslims." Needless to say, I think I touched a nerve.  Now normally I wouldn't have taken such a verbal beating from anyone, let alone a "man" in a skirt, but this was differet, I was not only representing myself out there, but I was also representing all the right-wingers in Douglas, maybe even in Wyoming. I had to remain calm. I had to control myself. I had to stay strong.   And that folks, is how I have spent every Friday since January,and although I have new signs, with new slogans, such as "America: Land of the Free, Because of the Brave" and "In Valor There is Hope," they still carry the same message: The men and women of the armed forces, who are over in Afghanistan, and over in Iraq, and all over the world, are out there, right now, defending our freedom, and giving there lives in order to preserve the freedoms that some of us take advantage of. On Sept. 11th, 2001, there was no terrorist attack...there was an act of war, and we retaliated, and for some reason, that pissed the left off. I'm going to leave you with a saying that should be remembered by every American. You hear Leftists "War is Terrorism." Well, I think they just have there words a little mixed up, because War is NOT Terrorism...Terrorism is War.
