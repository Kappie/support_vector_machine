Sometimes, I think about that.  I feel better when I don't.  I hope I don't look back on this page in 10 years and smack myself in the forehead -- you fool, Rob, you fool!  You know, smoking is a drug.  So -- I just saw Troy.  I wish that movie had been out when I was in highschool, because then I wouldn't have felt so lost in English class.
