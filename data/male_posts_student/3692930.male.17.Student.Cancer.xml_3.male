No Summer school today and I got up around 4:46 I was checking if the (translated version) Anbu-AonE_Naruto 89 episode had been released since the raw(not translated) one was cool to have but, all I really want is to understand whats going on.  I did get a version of episode 89 translated by some no-name group called SG that just used the dialogue from the manga and put it on the episode.  Well hope it comes out soon.  Okay...what else...Oh yeah more funny Flash movies I want to link:   urlLink History of Fuck   urlLink Free your Mind  (it's a funny Matrix parody with a...squirrel...thingy. Maybe a chipmunk?)  Well enough of this. Loading...    All computers are designed to be a perfect machine without mistake, until the first person touches them.
