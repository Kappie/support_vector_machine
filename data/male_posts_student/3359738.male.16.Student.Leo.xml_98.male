I wanted to kill them when I got to them, but I needed to get my breath back, and when I did, the anger was gone. Oh well.  Oh, yeah, forgot to mention... in my way to where we were going -- some beach kinda far away -- we had to go through normal sand, then a bunch of rocks, then a nudist beach filled mostly with gay men. I wanted to see where I was going, but it was a little hard because to my sides there were old, fat and thin naked men, and old, fat, naked women; so I said to myself "just stare at the ground and keep walking..." Past the nudist beach was the beach we were going to.  I thought I didn't need suncream, and I take that back, since like six hours later, I was burnt like a fucking hot sausage on a barbecue, AND STILL AM. Unlike other times when I've only burnt my back and/or shoulders, this time it's the whole damn body, and thank god I wasn't wearing speedos or my legs would seriously hurt.  Having that said, damn you, Sun!
