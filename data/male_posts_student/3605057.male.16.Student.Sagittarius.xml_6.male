Critique the conventional "self contained" classroom as an organization, and as a setting for incorporating technology. -I think it is more wise to believe that the best way of education is fully going into school and learning something with other people, more like interaction, because "self containment" is a very lonely kind of learning though effective, it could affect the moral of the student as a social person, Because our friendships and social life start at school right? It is not very advisable for students to be learning in a limited range of environment, therefore he must be ready to be exposed to the outside world and not only in a self contained classrom. There are many things that could be lerarned outside, especially the values and morals that we have to survive into real life situations.  6.) Describe the consequences of increased communication between home and school and the importance of home as a center for technology based learning. -As computer science students, all of us obviously is inclined in computers, also having 1 or more personal computers or laptops at home, obviously also having internet connections. You see, learning in the internet is a god way of practicing what we have learned already in school. Though not a perfect standalone library of knowledge, the internet and the computer is a main source of ideas and creativity. Home and School is indeed important to be connected because as we say, learning in both home and school go hand in hand. Without the home, we will find it hard to adapt to the school environment and the same goes at home. We need both learning from home and school in a increased communication, and at the same time, we do not rely completely on both these two.
