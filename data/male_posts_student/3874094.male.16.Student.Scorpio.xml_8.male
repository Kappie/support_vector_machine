Nothing fun happened on monday...only just the discovery that people do nothing but relax during workshops...very amusingly  opposite  to what the workshops are meant for....but hey i aint complaining.... And oh yea, samuel surprises me more and more with his er, behaviour in class....crazy guy just calmly watched his Spiderman 2 dvd during the tutorial, wahahahaha at least he provides some crazy in-class entertainment.. :p  And tuesday? Slept all the way till 12pm (SSSSssssh dont tell mum!) had a lazy brunch...read the papers....yAwn... Finally tried out the hair gel my sister gave to me...well...its not really gel..its more of er...brown goo or AKA bottle of shit/mud. But hey, its a goldwell product so i aint complainin..but OH MAN did that  "thing" stink  the whole bloody toilet!   Went to yuhua first in hopes of gettint the reprint of the leavin school cert but surprise surprise, mr ong being the bloody bugger with his inexhaustible supply of arrogance denying me once again...oh well...life's a bitch...  WAA class...heh, whole class was treated to periodic debates between a student and the teacher...talk about class involvement! This guy spoke his mind waaay to freely...but hey, better to be outspoken then some timid introvert yea?   And after class, went back to yuhua together with Ls to see our deear old yhhb and mdm peng...got blasted by mdm peng due to my earring...haha. And after that, is blah blah blah, played wc3 till 1 plus am...and now i am blogging about 2 days of my life that well, =  BORING . Oops nick just woke up, think lenny kravitz is singin a wee little too loud...ah heck who cares...later people.
