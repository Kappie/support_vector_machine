Although the Cardinals are well beyond the rest of the division, one can see that the two teams are virtually equal in all the major statistical categories.  There is one glaring difference however.  The Cubs have a slew of players still out with injuries.  I think that once these players come back, and the Cubs are whole again, they will once again be one of the best teams in the league.  A complete roster will make them very dangerous in October.
