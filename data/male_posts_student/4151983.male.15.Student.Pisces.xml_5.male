Chris Rix this year has so many reasons he can win it. This Year The Seminoles haveone of, if not  the best  offensive lines this year, one of the top five recieving corps in the country, and two good runningbacks.  "  Rix has as much talent as any quarterback in the country, he has a loaded offense full of experience to work with, and he has 34 starts of experience to rely on. If it all comes together and he improves his decision making ability, he has all the makings of a Heisman winner and first round draft pick.   "-Collegefootballnews.com    "Rix, often a magnet for critics, also happens to possess the best raw talent of any quarterback in Seminole history. Better than Charlie Ward and better than Chris Weinke, the program’s two Heisman winners. Yet, for all his physical gifts and considerable upside, Rix is the same player, who can exasperate a coaching staff with poor reads and reckless attempts to make something out of nothing. If, however, the light suddenly goes on, and he parlays all that talent into one breakthrough year, Rix could vault to the head of the class, ala Carson Palmer two years ago. Great quarterbacks have it, that certain nebulous quality that drives them to victory and makes everyone around them better. Rix has one final opportunity to prove he’s a complete quarterback, and not just a great set of measurables."    -Collegefootballnews.com
