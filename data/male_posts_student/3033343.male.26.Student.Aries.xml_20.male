I’ve been hoping for something like this for awhile.  Windows might finally have legitmate competition from Linux, and this might even persuade me to throw my copy of XP out the window (snare -> crash).      urlLink Update:   100 bar and restaurant owners gathered a week ago to pool the $10,000 retainer needed to hire an attorney to fight the  urlLink Connecticut smoking ban:    Bar owners claim they are losing as much as 60 percent of their business as smokers flock to establishments where they can light up.    urlLink Casinos and private establishments  are exempt, however.  Big Brother… but(t) out.  You know, there’s a VFW one town over and the casinos are about an hour away…. Perhaps it’s time for a change of venue.       urlLink $50 million in back royalties  are being paid back to artists in back royalties.     Some of the leading record and music companies have agreed to payout almost $50 million in unpaid royalties to thousands of musicians under a settlement agreement. The royalties were not paid because the record companies supposedly lost contact with the artist and were unable to disburse payments. Artists that were shortchanged include big names like Sean Combs, Gloria Estefan, Dolly Parton and David Bowie.    You have GOT to be kidding me.  This may be a rant in the making for another post.    Dentists, beware: You can use your own stem cells to  urlLink regrow your own teeth.   Healthier, and all natural instead of implants or dentures, they grow at a normal rate and are actual teeth.  Cool!  And guess what country has discovered this….    The chief executive of CVS called for the  urlLink legalization of imported prescription drugs.  It’s about time.  With competition from imports, the pharmaceutical industry will actually have to cut it’s exorbitant prices.   Google is going public, but they’re doing it a little different (of course).  With their clout, they can actually hold a  urlLink Dutch auction.   How this will pan out is really up in the air, but it definitely is an interesting idea.  Note, however, that are keeping control of the company by  urlLink having two tiers of stocks, retaining controlling interest.
