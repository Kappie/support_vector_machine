He's not bad, seriously, I managed to pay attention during those 2 periods for the first time in like a yr plus. I also did the homework I was given. Haha, well tt's a start since a yr. Will it pay off in the end? Nah! L0L!  For Social Studies, this new teacher replaced Mrs Zamree and was pretty alrite I suppose. She doesn't seem to haf control of the class though, den again, who does? Not many, tt's 4 sure. After S.S was Geography and we all had to go to the hall. There was this banding system tt was gonna take place for all the sec 4 express. We were going to be split to 3 classes. The first class would be in 4E1, second in 4E2 and third in 4E3. Only Eddy and Alvin got into the first class. Some went into the second and most in the third class. Malbindar and lil' pig were in the third class. Unfortunately, I was in the second class. I wanted to change class, not cuz of my frens, but cuz of the teachers. Mrs Ng took the third class and Mr Leong took my class. I kindda understand and do betta when Mrs Ng teaches me. In the end, I swapped wif Abbas as he preferred Mr Leong's style of teaching and wanted to get to my class.  During P.E, the whole cls couldn't find the damn teacher, so all of us juz went our own way. Some went for an early recess, some went back to cls and I dunnoe where da hell the rest went. L0L!  After recess was Basics, which was pretty cool. It was basically a slack lesson and there wasn't much to do. After 2 periods, we had to go for our health screening in the art room. When we got there, there were still other ppl in there, so we had to wait outside. I was squating outside the back door of the cls room. Fat pussy cat came along and wad do u noe? He planted his fat balloon-liked ass on my rite leg. He's realli some heavy shit man. After awhile I was in a sitting position and he was enjoyin it. He obviously doesn't noe how FAT he is! L0L! He kept bouncing as well, but luckily he got up after 5mins. If he would haf sat longer, my rite leg would haf decomposed due to his fat stinky ass! L0L! So I'll definitely consider myself lucky, and furthermore, I'm lucky tt it's the leg and not anywhere else. Hopefully he doesn't do anything to me wif tt ass of his anymore and hopefully he doesn't read this. L0L!  The health screening started off wif the eye checkup, which was my fav as I haf a perfect vision. L0L! Den came the blood pressure thing, the nurse who took mine said it was high, but later on another nurse said it wasn't high, but it was good. So I'm pretty lost, but I dun care bout' tt. The best thing was tt the nurse said I WAS skinny, but not anymore! So guys, get it straight, I'm NOT skinny! Haha, my clsmates wasted time in the art room so we didnt haf to go for Chinese. When we got back to cls, there wasn't any teacher, so we slacked till the end of the day.  All the sec 4 express classes had to attend some maths briefing immediately after sch. It lasted for like 15mins. Mr Lee Han Seng was juz like tellin us not to skip focus and stuffs. I wasn't realli paying attention, but the bottomline was tt we are not suppose to skip focus anymore unless we haf a valid reason. After tt, Me and Malbindar went to the hawker centre for lunch. Some of my clsmates joined us and at tt point I felt kindda uncomfortable, so I ate my food fast and both me and Mal left b4 any1 else cld do so. Lil piggy told me he was gonna take 176, but I didn't want to due to certain reason, so I juz said I had to go. I feel pretty guilty bout' it, so sorry my dear brother. Why I felt uncomfortable and wad was tt certain reason? Unbreak the code below to find out.  Code: Ic HoO sE2 lE@v EwHeN mYeNeM yIsS pOt tEd!  Alrite, I'll stop here for today. Cya all nxt time and whoeva manages to break the code, try to do smt bout' it ya? =]
