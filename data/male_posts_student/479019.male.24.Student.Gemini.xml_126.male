Steff is friends with people I haven't seen in like 10 years. Not to mentioning me getting her wine for her birthday and she got me whiskey for mine. Heh.. her friends were joking about how we basically swapped booze. Man... she and I have too many coincidences... makes you really think about that horoscope stuff eh?  Anyway... I get to sleep in tomorrow and work the evening shift. I also need to pack for my flight tomorrow too.  *****
