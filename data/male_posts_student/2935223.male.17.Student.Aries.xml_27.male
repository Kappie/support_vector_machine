So I decided to write in it now, a few minutes before I go to bed.  That's how important you people are to me, I care about your boredom, if it weren't for my blog, what would you do all day?!?!?!?!?!  Nuthing, you'd probably go insane and kill yourselves, and then I would be sad :-(    So.....What is there to talk about today....hm.....I'm not quite sure....hm......today was SEVERELY BLAH!!!!  Well, I spent all of 2nd block getting beat up and beating people up, and getting thrown into lockers....either way...it was ALL GOOD!  1st block I listened to peoples short stories, a few which involved murderers..and they were kreepily real.....I think people were bored by short story, it was about a blood elf named Kerrigor, if you want to read it just tell me...it was kool.(At least I think so)  Either way, after that, we were told to write about sumthing that makes us go "hm...", and guess what I wrote about....YOU ARE CORRECT, TINA!!!  Hm.....then what happened....lunch for sum reason hurt my mouth, quite a bit.  What else happened, TOMORROW IS THE CHOIR BIG....GROupy....thingy...it's gonna be kool, and i'm gonna dress all snazzy, it'll be kool.  Then Ervin and Steve came over after Steve, and there was no power at my house, so we played Clue, and I owned them, then I went to the bathroom, and while I was in there, the electricity came back on!!! Ah, the miracles of the toilet....:-P  Then I took Ervin to Pep band, and I finished my Japanese homework, and listened to a lot of my music....it was all good.....until of course I noticed that Tina was there, and then it all started to get depressing, but I honked at them on the way out because Tashca wouldn't get out of my car's way....poo on Tascha!!!  Then we(me and Ervin) were driving right behind Rachel and she ran a stop sign, so we followed her home and yelled at her.....poo on Rachel....POO ON EVERYBODY!!! Except for you kool people reading this....you people are kool...either way...I think I have run out of stuff to say......so...I'm gonna go back to my horribly boring depressing life.....PEACE!!  Spense
