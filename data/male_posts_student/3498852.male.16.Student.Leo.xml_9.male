Nothing has really happened...  the next Jamfest is on June 11th at the borough hall...   this shall be interesting.  I'm looking forward to it, but I don't know if we'll be ready in time to do a good performance.  Well that's all that's new on the homefront... I'll post more once something interesting happens. :-P  Currently Listening to: "The Greatest Fall" - Matchbook Romance  _TB
