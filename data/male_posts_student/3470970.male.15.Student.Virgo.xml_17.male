If you have anything to argue about with me, then e-mail me dumb sh*t, don't waste my time, I don't want to read your gay comment that doesn't make any sense at all. I'm gonna say it again, e-mail me you pussy, thats why I left my e-mail address on the right side, just above the shout box..  I inserted a shout box onto my site, so people who are not registered can make (sensible) comments more easily. It is possible for registered users to leave comments directly under the posts. If I would write down my true feelings in this post, then probably half of you would start whining about how prejudice I am...oh well
