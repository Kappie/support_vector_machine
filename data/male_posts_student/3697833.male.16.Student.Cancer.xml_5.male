Mistakes are remade, and you move nowhere. To move on is the key, and focus more on reality. Love is lost, mistakes were made, but learn from them and move on. The past may hurt, thisis true, but release the pain and soon it will flee. But nurture the pain, and more of it you will see. My past is clear, but my future is near. I have fought my mistakes to fix them for then, so they are not renewed. My lost past does hurt still, but I realize there is nothing now that can fill. My future is bright and I see the light, for the emptiness will soon fade. When love is brought into my heart, the stars will shine so bright. My darkness will die, true love comes nigh, and together, we will see the light.
