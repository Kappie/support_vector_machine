After doing this poetry unit.. i was reminded of the poetry project from last year (It's one of the very few assignments I kept from last year). We had to create some poems, draw a comic for a narrative poem, analyse some poems given, and choose any poem to analyse. It was an interesting project, especially that last part where you get to choose any poems. Stuck for a good poem, I borrowed my sister's little book of poems she copied down (a bunch of good poems to remember). There, I was wondering whether I should choose  "The Arrow and the Song"  or  "Invictus" .  "Invictus"  won... though the other is still a good poem.    For those of you that are too lazy to go and search for this really nice poem called  "Invictus" :    Out of the night that covers me,     Black as the pit from pole to pole,  I thank whatever gods may be     For my unconquerable soul.   In the fell clutch of circumstance     I have not winced nor cried aloud.  Under the bludgeonings of chance     My head is bloody, but unbowed.   Beyond this place of wrath and tears     Looms but the Horror of the shade,  And yet the menace of the years     Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.   It matters not how strait the gate,     How charged with punishments the scroll,  I am the master of my fate:     I am the captain of my soul.     Powerful, ne? The class liked it too ^^;;
