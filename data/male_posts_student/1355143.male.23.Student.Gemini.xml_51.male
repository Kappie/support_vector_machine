At the mo I am sitting in an internet cafe in the heart of London having just had an assessment centre with UBS (if you dont know who that is then look it up!),  and am now as sweaty as a paedophile in a nursery, pleasant thought I know!  Apart from that my life has generally been really hectic, went to Paris last week for a 3 day Warwick Uni seminar which was a bit of a joke, got to go on all the rides plus got smashed two nights at the one and only Hurricanes club, lots of young girls ;op  I then went on to stay at a friend of mine's in Paris for a further three nights of merriment and generally did bugger all sightseeing, dont think I would cut the grade as your common all garden Hamerican tourist!  I flew back to Barca on Sunday only to fly back to England on Monday and then my Ma and brother have flown out to Barca today so I have to fly back to meet them, and then my Dad comes tomorrow for........  MY BIRTHDAY on Friday, wooooooooooooooooooooo  I will be joining Tim on the big 2-1, who would have thought that somebody as immature as me could be so darn old?!?  Seriously should be good, very fancy restaurant lined up.  Anywayz, my time is running out and I dont wanna lose this so will add to it another time,  Be good boys and girls,  A xxxxxx
