Ayala, where all the well known malls are to be found. Always found to occupy thousands of people shopping, dating, eating, conducting buisness and whatever normal people usually do in their everyday lives... but it was midnight, and I was walking this street all alone, accompanied only by the few cars driving off home and a few bums here and there lying on the street. The lights guide the way for me, Edsa is where I'm headed. My head drooped lower as the rain poured harder on my back. I was freezing, walking half concious not noticing the scenery around me... what's there to see in this city anyway? There are just massive buildings that are found here anyway, buildings used for office, or residential purposes. It's a shame I don't know too many people living here except for my big brother and a couple of friends I barely know. I stopped by G4's lobby and shook myself dry.  I reached deep in my jean's back pocket and took out the brand new pack of Marlboro red's; which has slightly been wet by the rain; took a stick and lodged it in my lips then gave it a light. It was a sad day for me. I took a deep long puff from my cig and I tried to clear my mind. I was soaked. The street lights blinks at me furiously a couple of meters away from me and all I could hear was the pit-pattering of the rain as it fell on the hard asphalt road. I wasn't alone after all on that night, 3 or 4 people were there with me just wanting to escape the rain. One of them was an attractive young woman that appeared to be in here early twenty's. She was wearing a black hoody sweater with the words 'I like boys with tattoos' sewn in the front. And she had a tight dark blue bell bottom pants on. She looked cold; as did the guard who was probably on the grave hour shift; I didn't really pay attention to the other people. I just gazed at the street shown in front of me. The rain is actually a beautiful sight, it's a shame it doesn't feel that way when your under it.  I figure the rain would last longer than usual so I slid down against the wall. Sitting there as I watched nature do it's work. I took another puff from my cigarette, turned my head up high and blew a smoke ring at the ceiling of the mall's lobby. I was thinking of what my consequences would be once I get home. Would anyone find out I skipped from the house to get hammered? Most likely. I just hoped no one came down to check up on me. Whilst I pondered on, I overheard the woman in her early twenty's cuss and fight over the phone. I just stared at her in a dazed way and didn't even bother to make out the conversation she was having. She caught me staring at her, and she turned away and moved a bit farther from me. Paranoid bitch. I stared once again at the ceiling. I wondered on what it was made of... was it marble? It looked like marble, too bad it's high up for me to go and touch it's surface. The guard paced back and forth at his space and rambled on his walkie-talkie. And as for the other people they have gone into a taxi and drove off for home probably... "Why don't I get a taxi" you might be thinking if you ever met me in this situation. I'm broke.  I stood up from where I was seated and threw the cigarette I had in between my fingers. The woman wasn't on the phone anymore, but she still seemed pretty upset as she reached for a cigarette, it appears that she didn't have a lighter, cause she threw a short fit. I came up to her. I whipped out my lighter and offered her a light "Rough night eh?" I said as she reached over to light her cigarette. "Yeah pretty rough night... and you?" she replied. "Same here... alright then, I'll be back over there." I said as I put my lighter back in my back pocket. I didn't know why I did that but it can't be helped, I already done it. So once again I sat in the place I was at earlier staring once again at the street... it was quite hazy now as the rain poured harder... The woman came over to me, and asked if she could sit with me. I was shocked. You never ever find people like that over here, especially in the streets, sure at the clubs you could, but where I was sitting, never. "Sure" I said as I scooched over...  I leaned my head against the wall as she slid down beside me. Once again I found myself staring at the ceiling thinking, that the wall must be made of marble, or if it isn't, maybe it's black smooth tiles that look like black marble... idunno... My pondering has been broken by the woman's voice... "Ok, so tell me what are you doing here at a time like this?" She asked me with much ease... "And my name by the way is Sarah" She followed up... "Me? Idunno I figure it would have been a good walk in the rain, broke..." I said in reply to her question... "Oh ok... and ur name is?" Sarah asked showing a bit of dissapointment... "Would it even matter if I give you my name? I mean we won't probably see each other again anywhere anyway..." I said blurting out a short sarcastic laugh as I shifted my stare at her. "Fine, be sarcastic... I mean it was you who first opened up..." Sarah said as she flashed a face of distaste... "Alright, I'm Chris... nice to meet you" I said in a jokingly manner as I reached out my right hand for her to shake... "Nice to meet you too" She said as she took my hand and giggled a bit...  "If you don't mind..." Sarah said "I was wondering why you're broke..." My God what is this? An interview with the local folk here? I felt like I was in an internet chatroom. "I'm not sure I can tell you that information, I mean you have not yet told me your reason on why your out here." I said as I looked at the street again."Ok fair enough..." she started "I got too rowdy at the bar and my friends left me." Sarah finished... "That still doesn't explain why you're still hanging around here, I mean there are a few unoccupied taxis passing by here, you could've gotten one already and head on home" I said showing signs of distrust as I took my pack of cigarettes out... "Ok, if you want to know the whole picture that much I'll tell you then..." she said flashing me that distasteful look again... " I live at my friends condo, and since I went overboard at the bar earlier they left me there, and the reason I can't go home now is I lost my set of keys." She finished again... "Can't you just go there and just ring the doorbell constantly then?" I said in reply as I lit my cigarette... "You don't know how my friends are like... nevermind, you'll never understand."  The rain continued pouring, I was beginning to think this isn't just a normal rain but a typhoon. Sarah continued talking, and I just kept nodding at every question she laid on me, till finally... "Are you even listening me?" She said... I just simply said "Yup" "Ok what was I sayin earlier then?" she asked me "Uh... you were talking bout ur friends bein this and that and that they'll never let you in whatever you do etc... look I get you..." I told her in reply, she just said "Ok then... that's my story on why I'm here... and now it's your turn..." I was just thinking whether or not I should go and tell a stranger my situation, but I guess it's only right since she seems to have spilled me her story... "Ok..." I said as I took a long puff and blew 2 to 4 smoke rings...   "My reason of being here..." I started off... "is cause I overspent at the bar, nothing amazing about it, I just drank and gave all my buddies a treat, the thing is here though, they left me there." I took another puff and I noticed Sarah reaching for her own pack of cigs... "I mean I just went off to the restroom I came out they were just gone... the only thing they left me was a bill of all the extra orders they had..." "So how were you able to pay for it?" Sarah asked... "I didn't, well not all of it, I gave em all the rest of my cash and I told em I'd pay them back" I told Sarah as I lit her cigarette.       The rain slowed down, so I stood up and started walking. "Where are you going?" Sarah asked me as she too rose from the floor... "The rain isn't pouring hard anymore, so I'll continue my walk home... I suggest you go find a taxi and head on home too, or wherever you can sleep tonight" I said as I turned to answer her question... "So you're gonna leave me w/o saying goodbye or giving me a number?" Sarah said as she folded her arms... hmm I can't believe she's sayin these things, is it my charm? is it cause I took the time to talk and listen to her? I don't know, but whatever I did made her want to see me again... well in my perception of the whole scenario... "Ok... sure, why not, here's my number..." I said with a smile, and she noted my number in her phone. "Thanks" Sarah said flashing back a smile at me... "You take care then Sarah, bump into you some other time..." "You too..." Sarah said in reply, at this I turned and faced the cold wet street. I was once again walking home...
