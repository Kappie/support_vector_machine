I'm actually annoyed- no, pissed- because I just wrote a HUGE first entry and my computer just closed the window before I could post it. I basically listed all my goals for the summer, and talked about my experiences for these first days of vacation. But I'll get back to those later, because I want to post before my computer crashes or whatever again. Damn, why can't I have a reliable computer!
