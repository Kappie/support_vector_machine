Our money is going towards protection from terrorism and to me, that is way more important than having Grade A textbooks and Chess Clubs. Ok, so you have good stuff in school. Next minute your skeleton dust is imprinted on the wall by a 500 megaton A-Bomb. Our money goes to The FBI, CIA, SWAT, NYPD, MARINES, ARMY, NAVY, AIRFORCE, UN and alot more so we can keep this country free from terrorists and threatening dictators such as Saddam Hussein. Before you blame our government, blame the horrible criminals who force us to spend money on United States Defense.  My dad told me this. At first I didn't want the war and didn't want our school losing special programs such as after school sports and other events for fun. I wanted a good quality school. Unfortunetly, we can't afford these things. It's not the state's fault nor the White House's. Don't blame Bush. Blame those assholes for brainwashing their people into thinking of the Islamic religion as a self righteous suicide such as in 911. Saddam is corrupting regular people like you and me and turning them into terrorists who think they will get a great life after they die on Earth. That's not what the Islamic religion is. The Islamic religion is peaceful and it's made for people who think of great reincarnation only for good people who achieve greatness in life. Not for people who commit suicide and killing others. Don't hate certain races because I guarantee if Saddam was in charge of this country, we'd be brainwashed also. Terrorists are in every country. It's a shame we can't somehow kill them all. There will always be terrorists because this world is sick and they will always have their little groups but never again will America allow these groups to take action. That's why we need to spend our money on protection. Saying you want money spent on books, is as good as saying you being attacked by terrorists.  My dad can teach me pretty cool things. Ya... he was a cop, now he's a LIMO driver. Pretty cool, he gets payed a shit load of tips. Ok, track is awesome again. Kaiser and I ran with the track team around the school outside about 5 times in 30 minutes. I love running, and I love singing James Brown just to make people lose their breath when they laugh. Today was normal. I'm now going out with Angelica, no not in our grade. And... the protest took place today. Ya... pretty much what my whole SPEACH is on. OK BYE
