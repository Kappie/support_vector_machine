I love my friends to death, but do we really need to label ourselves with titles like 'emo'? Emo for God's sake. It's the social group for people who need to be labeled. I guess people just need to feel part of a whole. Fuck them ;/.    Back to life. Life is... Ok. I'm trying to recall what I've done since my last post, but I can't think of anything except Six Flags with Mike, which, speaking of it, was pretty kickass. Jason ended up winning, on his first try,on this game I had put well over $40 into. Ehh, good for Jason :D! I was happy for him. We went on a bunch of Rollercoasters before Jason's win, but after, with Jason's nine-foot stuffed lizard, it was difficult to walk through the park. We got a lot of attention though, but it was exhausting.    I also got my schedule!    I'm going to post it here so when people ask I can link to it.     First Semester - "A" day    1A  Spanish II   2A  Driver's Ed   3A  Resource   4A  English II Literature Honors     First Semester - "B" day    1B  Chemistry Honors   2B  Algebra II Honors   3B  World History Honors   4B  Speech     SecondSemester - "A" day    1A  Spanish II   2A  PE   3A  English II Writing Honors   4A Resource     Second Semester - "B" day    1B  Chemistry Honors   2B  Algebra II Honors   3B  World History Honors   4B  Health Wellness    So far I have one class with Kristin, and no classes with Jason.    I went out and bought a nice calculator (Ti-84 II), and I've been downloading games for it a lot recently. I'll probably never play them in the actual class -_-. Today I hung out with Jason, and that was it.    Speaking of The Warped tour(Yes, I know I didn't mention it), I think I can probably get a ride there, but I don't want to go alone. Argh. Nobody I know seems really interested in it. I think I'm going to go and then see if I can find anyone from school.  Whew. Caught up.
