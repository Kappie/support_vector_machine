With attempts made by so many More than most have been hit with reality A reality where there is loneliness, pain and death  Why is it that we, the knowledgeable, must endure this hurt? So that the few, oh so very few can reap the benefits of another While we sit, alone and crying at the fact that we will never Love  We shall never know, nor feel what the grace of another is like To rely and be cared for, to entrust in someone else as they hold you tight While this harsh reality hits and tears at the flesh of us less fortunate With a pain that never really subsides until we are met with death  There are however glimpses, or moments when we may think we know Love But as we are met with this feeling, we are quickly snapped back to reality To realize that there is no hope, no reason and nothing to try for As a life that dangles above a pit of doom on a string comes one step closer to snapping... To plummet alone, with no notice or thoughts of remorse, as this life was meaningless...
