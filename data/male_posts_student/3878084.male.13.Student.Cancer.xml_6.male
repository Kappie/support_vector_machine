Then of course Jordan came and picked me up and we went and chilled at his house.  Thats where I was the rest of the day.  He had alot of family over.  1 cool thing is I got 2 new cds.  Yellowcard Ocean Avenue, and Linkin Park Meteora.  Got home from Jordans around 9.  Basically after that all Ive been doing is talking online and listening to my new cds.  Got jcc tomorrow and have to go to the fricken orthodontist for all u peeps who want to knoe dr.darling.
