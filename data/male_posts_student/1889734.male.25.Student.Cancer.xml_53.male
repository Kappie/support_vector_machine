There are so many commonly accepted 'facts' that are really nothing more than hysteria.  Like the 'fact' that Bush lied about Iraq's attempt to procure uranium from Niger.  In truth, BUsh reported a British Intelligence source that made that claim, and even qualified that statement by saying it was the belief of the British Government.  That was somehow twisted into "Bush lied!".    The media bears an awesome responsibility to question and report on what is going on.  They are important enough to warrant their own mention in the Constitution.  The responsibility also requires a solemn respect of their duty, which they seem to lack.  The media needs to report facts, not spin facts to suit their political agenda.  Why is it that most journalists are to the left?  A recent poll of journalists revealed 80% voted for Gore.  Scratch a reporter, and you find an activist.  I understand human nature, and it is unreasonable to expect true objectivity.  I can live with that, I suppose.  I just wish they would stop pretending to be non-partisan.
