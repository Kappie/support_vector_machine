I think an online socrates cafe would not work at all.  everyone would be talking at once and so the discussion would be somewhat stunted.  That happens on all chat rooms and I doubt this one would be any different.  So for now I'm gonna say no.  Even  if  Christen's there, seeing as I have a girlfriendwith whom I'm quite happy. Ok, Drama.  Today in our scene groups we all got the same scene, but we had to figure out what the somewhat cryptic dialogue was about, and make up motions to go along with it.  It was really fun. I have four essays to write.  That makes me sad ): But Drama, Ashley and the fact that it smells like Christmas make me happy (: Jonah: How about AB, then AC, then AD, etc.  either in the first word or the first and second?
