It felt so good... and now I have a full night's (er, morning's) rest. I have one friend online so far... and I met one of my other friend's little sister. And that is all I've done today... talked to 2 people (and my little bro at home). Maybe I should finally clean off my bed, since I long to sleep in it once more.  Well, camp is 1 week from today! I'm pretty excited, but I think it'll need to be closer for me to REALLY get excited. I might buy a disposible camera so that I can have some pictures... but I don't know, I'm kind of a cheapskate. I hope the food is good...
