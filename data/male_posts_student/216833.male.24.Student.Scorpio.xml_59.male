I only had 16 bucks and just yesterday I had alot more than that.   I got hot and felt that panic feeling come over me. Oh shit - did i screw up and spend to much money. I don't think so. I went over all the things that I had bought over the weekend and it didn't add up. Not even close. MiMi's card was stolen out of her purse at a gas station in west texas the weekend before memorial day.  She called me right after it happened - I called the bank and the card was blocked. Problem solved.   I'm not sure now.   So I call the bank and she lists off a few debits that have not posted. At first she only gave me the amount. $10 $8 $1 $250 $50 $150 $100  OK - I'm officially freaked out. those are big chunks of my rent due very soon!! She gives me the name of the company making the debit Planet Services WTF is that shit??!? I've never heard of this, and so I start my search.   Oh there is one for $500 that didn't go through. Well shit! thanx fuckers. I hope all of this is some big mistake becuase I don't want to wake up in the morning and be broke while Planet Services is sittin by some pool with my money!  I'm gonna be sick....
