No doubt a relief to all who are reading...I have nothing to say here because I am all written out for the night...oh, and Bobby, just remember, in that game of NCAA where you beat me...all I had to do was play for real and I would have held my massive lead...I chose to make it interesting and it bit me in the ass as usual...so don't make up some lies about how you "dominated" me! Next time, I'm running the ball with :19 left and the lead instead of throwing off the back foot of the awful Marcus Vick!!!  PPPPPPPPPPPPPeace, Alex
