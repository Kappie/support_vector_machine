However, seeing King Arthur with Niki didn't go that bad.....so like I said you gain some you lose some =). Those were the two main highlights of my day, and the rest of the details follow:    Morning was really slow today. It was friggin' impossible to get out of bed this morning for some reason, but eventually I forced myself to wake up and head downstairs. There was supposed to be some insurance person coming to talk about....well insurance....but funny part was he spent 45 minutes looking for my house because he thought my house number was 181, though there is no 181 on my street haha....so yeah in the end my mom rescheduled for next Monday. Ugh breakfast..er more of brunch today was sandwiches. I haven't ate a sandwich in eons, and I remember why. Bread taste so bland after a while. I don't get how some people can actually manage to pack a sandwich for lunch everyday....I would actually die. So after washing down the bread with a lot of juice, I brushed my teeth and stuff, got changed, and then headed off to Masonville.    Beat Niki to the mall, so waited about 5 minutes before she arrived. It was he first time since school ended that I saw her, and it was nice to see she is still the same cheery person she has always been. Walked around the mall for a bit, and then headed into the theatre. I was my usual dumb self, so Niki led the way to the theatre since I didn't know where in the world I was going...    The movie wasn't that bad.....I guess. I probably would see it again, and it is DVD worthy, but there's something missing...... I still don't know what....but it needs something else added for it to be an ass-whooping movie. They probably have one of the poorest pickup lines ever to lead into a sex scene though, and that deducts probably 20 points, and also not enough blood......so that was also what I didn't like....they need more gore to match with Gladiator or Troy =P.    After the movie, while waiting with Niki for her parents, all of a sudden....    The twins pop out of nowhere.    It was weird, one minute I was talking to Niki the next I hear a "JOSEPH!" and then I see Mike and Dan. So then chatted with them too for a bit, Niki's parents came just a bit after the twins arrived. Originally I was going to leave for my bus stop, but eventually, laziness defeated me and took Mike and Dan's offer for a ride lol. They were headed that-a-way anyways, so meh...why not =P. Originally Niki offered a ride, but she lives on the other side of town, so thought it'd have been better off if I bused. Oh well....but laziness....yeah......you know how it comes and just puts you at gunpoint to be lazy.....so yeah......in the end I got a ride from Mike and Dan heh.    After getting home, SCed for a bit, and heard one of THE most bizarre stories ever. Apparently yesterday after I left an MSN convo with Josh and Jason, afterwards, they somehow had a war between High paid lawyers and Lucas Arts versus Dungeons  Dragons featuring Goku and the Fanboys, or vice versa. Both ways it was weird.....Josh had a one sided 21 dice or something, and then Jason said he was going to sue for cheating. Then Josh "burned" the evidence but then realized he had no dice to fight with now. ANYWAYS I am still just as confused/shocked about this story, and also this really puts stupidity to a new level, and concludes in my theory that LCAC has absolutely NO intelligent people in HYPE. Calvin's ran into a locked door, Josh and Jason had that REALLY strange story, I've proven many times that I have my super dry jokes, Brian thinks Terry Payton is a star Lakers player, and Gavin thought London had a subway system with every Mac's variety store as a subway stop. So yeah....we are now all officially dunce. Oh yeah and the twins.....have their new form of Chinglish haha. So yeah....I can now officially say LCAC has no smart population within the youth group of guys =P. The girls....they're slowly getting there....Carmen and Lina both have had their moments, and so has Rebecky tripping over a wooden pole. So yeah, stupidity is now at a new level, and I even told Josh and Jason that their right of calling me stupid, has just been taken away from them =P.    Anyways after some SC and that VERY weird story, I then went to play badminton....    Saw Steve Zhao there today, along with a Jane from Lucas who Lina says she owned, Lina, Gavin, and Josh.  Jason also came too, but he balled. So today in badminton, my record turned out to be something like 1-3, which really sucks as now my total record is something like...5-7....ugh. I don't know why I keep track, but meh something to do I guess =P. Lina was a lucky horseshoe for every game she played, with SO many fluke shots that I just stopped trying after a bit. Me and Gavin when we played her in doubles, geez she made 4 just barely over the net shots. While resting, we played with Steve's deck of cards, mostly Big Two. Then Gavin and Lina kept asking Jason to play badminton, where Gavin then stopped, then started poking and telling him to play baddy again, leading to my SHUPA stupid joke:     Gavin: Warning: Incoming badminton flood  Jason: Dude, you and Lina have been flooding me for baddy for the last 10 minutes.  Gavin: Uhh....ok...well then....MEGA BADMINTON FLOOD  Joe: Haha....badminton flood. Gavin, it'd be something like...."Badminton.....NNNNNYYYUHHHHHH!" *pretends to drown from a badminton "flood" ha.....ha.....*  Gavin: SMPGO!  Joe: BOLL!  Jason: (after seeing it ) LOL!     So yeah, you probably have to see it to see what we are talking about, but yeah Gavin and Jason probably still know what I'm talking about. Also Jane then pointed out I talk a lot...who hasn't =P.    Then afterwards, when me and Gavin were playing again against Josh and Lina in a game of doubles, we came up with a new strategy....MAKE THE OTHERS LAUGH SO THEY CAN'T CONCENTRATE:     Joe: Alright Gavin time to put on our game face  Gavin: GAME FACE *two thumbs up and makes a very big smile*  *Joe and Gavin start to SMPGO and lose total concentration*           So our plan failed, but point is, we tried =P. Eventually we got owned due to horrid luck, and also like I said, we lost concentration and Josh and Lina just looked at us as though we were tards. We eventually lost really bad, but that's besides the point it was funny at the time.    Eventually badminton did end, and then walked home with Lina.    Now I'm here....blogging...and chatting. I think I'm going to go watch Leno maybe.    Later.
