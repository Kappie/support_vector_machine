After two years of misery, four months of not going for classes, moments of joy, moments of anger, moments of grief (!), moments of boredom and moments of sheer insanity, the “debate” part of my life is finally over. I may sound relieved, and in a way, I am, but when I consider the fact that had we won I would have been a mere sixteen minutes away from being part of a National-level champion team, disappointment sinks in. Anyways, I am not going to wallow in disappointment. Going back to class was amusing. The more rational-headed ones welcomed us back nicely, which was great. The brick-headed ones have yet to stop asking us what in the blue blazes made us lose, which is not so great. Whatever it is, “debate” definitely lives on (in my memory anyway)...   Quarantine  Quarantines were one of the more “colourful” aspects of debates, especially for us. Did we work? Well, to say we didn’t would be an understatement. But in the early stages of the competition, we would sneak food in and start playing around while in quarantine. Later on, it was more serious stuff, although I had the opportunity of having a go on a drum set that was in that Taiping school...   Identity Crisis  Well, that only applies for me. Till this very day, my Principal thinks my surname is Khaled, for some reason or the other. Every single time he’s called the team out during assembly, he’s called me that, and I’ve had to stifle torrents of laughter as I stand there thinking “who’s Khaled”. I think he’s been reading too many reports on those terrorists.   Wild Goats  Our journies to and from the debate venues have always been eventful. On the way home from Parit Buntar, a teammate of mine had something going on about wild goats. Must’ve been high on something. In Taiping, our teacher had the misfortune of confusing her left and her right…go figure!   Training  By far the best part of debates. Aww, c’mon, we needed to have some sort of distractions during training, didn’t we? And having access to a whole bunch of computers was really tempting anyway. Here’s to Unreal Tournament and World Cup 2002! Those were two great games...   The King And I  Thanks to the time-wasting training sessions during the hols, I have practically watched the entire school play – well, the unrefined version anyway.   Homework  I still have lots of these...no comments.   Tim, Andrew, Josh, Sheng Yuen  Four great guys who have been great teammates. Cheers to them!  (And J-X deserves it too, I guess, as he got us through the first round before he had to leave for good ol' Kay-El)
