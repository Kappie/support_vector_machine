The second half was easier but hurt all the same b/c the lactic acid at that point was faily high in my quads. It got to the point where all i could think about was the pain. However, i stopped off at Dead Man's flat for some quick sugar because my blood sugar levels were at an all time low. There i bought some vitamin I. Oh blessed vitamin I. by the time i got to canmore, the pain was all gone. Complaints aside, the trip was a lot of fun. GREAT workout. Talk about your base line cardio. So i got into Canmore bout a quarter to four and realized i didnt know where the hostel was. So after asking some locals where i might find this lodge i got some direction.. it was halfway up a *@ing mountain. At that point i got off my bike and pushed it up the hill. The hostel is out of this world. Its nothing like any hostel iv stayed at before. Its beautiful. large rooms, a gorgous sitting room, a modern kitchen, showers, wahing machines, and ofcouse, a computer. So after i checked in, i changed a walked to downtown Canmore, about a fifty minute walk, which is fine since i had to get the acid out of my muscles anyways. I got a light vegitarian wrap at the bagel co. downtown, stopped at IGA (sorry, Sobies) to get some milk for breakky tomorrow and walked back, just missing the rain. Iv been bumming around the clubhouse reading Mags. Its gotta be around 8:15, and i have 3 minutes left of internet use.  some things i saw on the road: - A dead deer - large amounts of tire remains - an abundance of dead animals  will report about the trip back to Calgary when i get there
