No.. i believe she will think that way too.. actions were taken but went down to drain because of my stupid responsibilities.. when can i get done with all these troublesome and vexatious problems.. i dun ask that she wait for me.. ironically, i hope she will be there whenever i need her.. its so selfish of me.. Zhengwei, Zhengwei.. u juz cant think of any solutions, isnt it? u are juz one stupid boy who always wish but nvr do.. ~haiz~~~~ there it is another day thinking of her..
