Some people just can't stay up and some can.  Oh well, I don't mind workin' the "graveyard shift" for our blog.  It is a little depressing though, havin' to blog alone, especially since this is a dual blog.  Lets take a quick look at who is online right now.....looks like  Mario, Elyse, and Jeanell  are the only ones on this late.  I wonder what they are all up to.  I wonder if  Nick  has fallen asleep yet.  There's a lot of things I wonder about, but sometimes I never get an answer to the things that I wonder about.  This blog I'm typin' doesn't seem as exciting as the last ones I recently got off the press.  I think I am startin' to get kinda tired...Hmmm no, thats not like me...but I did work all day on a stupid history project.   Elyse  is havin' some sorta drama with  her ex  right now...don't relationships suck?  Hey  Nick , there is a topic related to "suck"...relationships!  Well, aren't you proud of me?!  You know somethin' though,  Nick's  definition of the word  suck  was the bad version of sucking.  There is a good version of sucking that I know of and its really cool.  Yeah, perverted huh?  Well too fuckin' bad, you guys know that I can't go a minute without makin' a dirty joke!  But that version of sucking isn't bad...it is similar to the bad version in the act that somethin' is sucked outta somethin', but lemme tell ya, in the good version it ain't energy!  Well the graveyard shift will continue in a bit...lemme just think of another topic!
