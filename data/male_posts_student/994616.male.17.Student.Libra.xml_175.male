The only reason I'm writing right now is becaue I don't want to get back to work on my assignment yet.  I suppose the only real thing to say right now is that I'm chatting to a relatively cute guy on MSN. He's kinda bufftacular. He's got one of those pictures where if i met him in real life he couold be hot or he could be not... Who knows.
