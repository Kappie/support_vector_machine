The end of this past week was a hectic one. On Thursday, we had our playoff game at Paint Branch for the summer basketball league I'm in. We lost by 4 to the "best team in the league", Montgomery College. I put the parenthesis up because they were definitely not as good as advertised. I had a good game (as usual) with 19 points, but an L is an L. All in all, the league was alot of fun, and I'm glad my boy T put me on with it. Good lookin' shorty.  Friday, I got paid(finally) and went down to Artscape after work with Sam, Twin, and Flip. It was cool, but us being the black people that we are(yes, Sam is black, hahaha), we didn't get down there until about 10. It was really weird not being at Artscape with Luke. I think that this is the first time in about 5 years that I went down there without him....miss ya dawg :( Saturday, I had dinner with Sam and his family visiting from Boston. It was a pretty chill weekend, didn't really go out much...but then again, I rarely go out like that anymore. In MY opinion, the only good reason to go out to clubs is to hang with friends. I'm not saying that clubbing in order to dance, meet girls/guys, get fucked up, or to apply for a position as a bouncer(whaddup Dre!) is wrong; I'm just saying that it's not really for me anymore, at least not on a regular basis. Maybe I'm growing up??? Or maybe I'm just getting really lazy. Whatever though.  So my sweetheart has been down at Myrtle Beach for the past 4 days, and she comes home today. I haven't spoken to her in those 4 days...I just wanted her to have fun with her sister and best friend, didn't really think it'd be appropriate for me to be harassing her every 10 minutes like I wanted to. I can't wait to see her again. Ever feel like there was a certain part of your life that was going so well itreally could've been scripted for a movie or TV show? Yeah..........thats how things are with MTB. I wouldn't change one thing about our situation, not even the fact that she's definitely going to be in NY in the fall, and I might be there too. I've never ever had an experience like this, andmy only wish is that I can experience this for the rest of my life, with her.....thank youkiddo.   I'm off to dream about seeing the world...........peace
