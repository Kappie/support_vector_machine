Sean Jackson - Or 'traitorous bastard' as I like to call him (in my head ofcourse, as much as I would like a little revenge on these people, I  do  know what's legal and what's not so it's best all kept in my head). There was a time when I would have trusted this person, even thought of him as an actual friend, so much so in fact that I put my trust in him once and began the steady process of telling him my secrets. The worst mistake I'd ever made in my life. No sooner had I started to tell him the beginning of it all and the secrets that I'd kept from everyone than he began to blab them to others. My secrets aren't only my own, they're shared with many others I'm acquainted with and therefore when old Seany boy began his sly little hints about my secrets to others he was hinting about the secrets of not just me but many others. It's for this reason that  I  would be the one to be punished because of these secrets being let loose. Punished more dearly than I could have ever dreamed. Alyssa was killed because of this person who I once trusted. The murderersleeps in prison now and I'm free to tell my secrets to the world but that's little comfort when the person I loved nowsleeps in a grave.  So if you know this person, firstly I'd like to pity you for knowing such a down right low and selfish person and secondly I'd like to warn you never to trust him and never to so much as become a friend of his. He does not deserve it. It's all I can do to stop myself from killing him where he stands, I'm a firm believer in an eye for an eye afterall. Any deranged psychopaths out there, I suggest you make Sean you're next target. Give him hell, it's only fair.
