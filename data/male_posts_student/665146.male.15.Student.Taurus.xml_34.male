I'll be back next year, but I'm stuck between 3 choices:  Writing for College, The Internet Classroom, or Introduction to Psychology.......  Let's see....  Writing for College:  I'll get to improve on the skills that I acquired from this year, it will help me if and when I go to School of the Arts, and I'll become a better writer all together.  However, the homework will be hell, and I'm not really a good writer in the first place, just an essay writer.  The Internet Classroom:  I would get to learn how to use html code and other various workings of the internet via the creation of my very own web page which I would then get to present at the end of the session.  Still, I already know a lot, and there has to be something ridiculously hard about this class.  Introduction to Psychology:  I would learn about the inner workings of human intelligence and behavior, which will allow me to help others and myself with depression (a useful trait at this age), and possibly manipulate people for my own sick twisted purposes!  However, I don't think I should have that power, there'll be LOTS of homework, and like Jhonen says, "A closer look at what's wrong with you might scare the shit out of you."  But I have a lot of time to decide.....  So I can relax now...  North Carolina here I come....
