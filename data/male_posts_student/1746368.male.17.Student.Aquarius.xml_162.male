A few things we missed since our last visit:  Mutterings:    Abundance:: Of rain  Casino:: 21  Shell:: Station  Overpriced:: Gas!  Cancellation:: Canceled?  Eternal:: Life with Christ!  Lyrics:: Song  Faith:: I can move a mountain, I can do all things through Christ  Because:: Supreme ruler of the world!  Wimp:: Yes I am!    And today:  Whatever Wednesdays: 1. Do you wear your seatbelt? Yes I do. 2. When do / did you graduate high school? June of 2005 3. How often do you get mail? Everyday! Personally though? Never...maybe once a month.  E-mail? All the time! I'm very popular! (no seriously, I have a pretty good rep on the internet; people love me!)  Anyways, I've been doing well, post any comments or concerns after the long line covering most of this space (the one that says "comment...")    "Ten Second Tom: Aren't you a little old to be... Hi, I'm Tom! (Guy is missing part of his brain and his short term memory works for about ten seconds)"   --50 First Dates ('cept I'm not quite sure there were 50)
