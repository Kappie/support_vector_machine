Saw all the people and they played a game. Pretty amazing haha and bought a t-shirt also. Then Friday was the pre-camp rally. Yes! patterson goign to Impact! It's gonna be sooo awesome can't wait! yea we talked about the misconceptions of going to camp lyk it being a place where u meet ur spouse, camp's goign to be awesome!, or this year is gonna be beter this last year. Camp being awesome meaning that we needa prepare our hearts for camp and to go there adn really try to seek God. Then watched video by Daniel Lin which was hilarious lol  Saturday went to Josh's house for worship team practice. Daniel, and Jesse were there to. Amazingly we had a producting almost 2 hr practice haha first time ever. Yea eveyrthing went pretty smoothly, Josh with his awesome new guitar sigh.. so nice i want one of those.. but yea.. and after Josh, Esther, Jesse and I went to first colony for some lunch and then to the movies where we watched Spiderman 2. It was alrite, but ending was pretty.. ionno cheesy.. haha yea.. then we just went back to Josh's hosue, they're NEW house haha don't think i mentioned earlier but they moved to sweetwater.. he's going to clements and so is esther.. sucks.. and they prolly end up going to FBCC.. double sucky.. ah well guess its all part of God's plan. sigh..   Sunday worship went alrite, went to Josh's house again rite after to help them prepare for July 4th party. haha interesting time, first me and esther helped err fix this cabinet thing, lyk replace the handles.. haha... yea.. and then just watched her clean her room... fun. haha but then josh came and we played sequence for lyk.. 2 hrs. yea.. getting annoyed by that game.
