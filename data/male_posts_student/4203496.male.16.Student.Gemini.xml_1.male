We went off to Taco Bell (wouldn't want to clean the bathrooms there) evidently no one does, they are as filthy as, as, a resteraunt selling spicy food's should be. That wasn't even the highest point of the evening though!   The Village , It was good, my father hated it but my mom and I stand by our decision. It was one heck of a film, eerie and odd but good. Now see it, I comand you.  *ends tansmission*
