That really sucks cause I miss her so much and I just wanted to spend some time with her.   I almost feel well enough to get out of the house for a while.  Maybe I'll go rent me a movie or something... Somebody might be comming over later, I could definately use some tlc.  So I get a call from my best friend the other night and he sounds all shooken up over something.  Turns out some jerks at the bar started some crap with him and another friend of mine and there were some punches thrown.  Not only that they did something to his truck.  Now I'm no fighter by any means and I definately dont like to start crap.  But when somebody messes with one of my friends it just goes all over me.  I swear if we ever see these guys again, and I know we will, I dont know whats going to happen but its not going to be good.
