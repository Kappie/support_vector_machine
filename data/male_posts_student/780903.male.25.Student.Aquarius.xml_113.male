I thought it sounded like it would be really interesting -- that it would cover some of the territory I spend way too much energy thinking about.  About people fitting in"the box" and stuff like that.  But no.  It was a psychology gobbledygook speech about finding a place where Personal values, Community values and Professional values converge into one.  It didn't make any practical sense.  It was mumbo-jumbo.  I have no idea what the guy was talking about.  So disappointing.  Because I thought it was really going to be about the stuff I obsess about.
