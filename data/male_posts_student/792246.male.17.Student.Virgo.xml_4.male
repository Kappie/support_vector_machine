Lame Claudia(hehe, it's a pun) has dubbed my sister(and as usual, the subtitled version is sooo much better), and dubbed her very wrongishly. Baby Bun-Bun indeed. I have some......unfinished business to take care of. Oh don't be upset, it was a mercy killing.  Now I have an important announcement for everyone. I like potato. I also like cabbage. I really love potato when it's all warm. It really makes me hungry. There is nothing like stuffing a big fat potato in your mouth and just sucking on it. Mmm, potato.  Now a very important public service announcement from our very own, Jonathan the Monkey. The very first talking monkey works for us now, mua ha ha. His first eye witness report is right here.  Jonathan:Feces taste bad.  Thank you Jonathan, and be sure to tune in next week viewers to see what happens when you give Jonathan a knife, a banana, and a Barbara Streissand blow-up doll and lock him in a room for 48 hours. This is Eric, saying good night.   This doesn't really have any content for me to actually comment on. Strange post, stranger people.
