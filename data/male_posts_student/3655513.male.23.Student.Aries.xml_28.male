I sold my XBOX this summer as well, and aside from my periodic stints with FFXI and now Doom3, I really couldn't be bothered with video games. Not that I don't still find them entertaining, it's just that they aren't as good as they used to be (the developed games that is) and if I devote too much time to playing them, I feel guilty cause I have so many other things going on in my life.  Speaking of other things, my biological father is coming down to visit this weekend. He's stopping through Calgary on his vacaation here in Alberta. It's going to be great to see him (as I haven't spent significant time with him since October 2002 and haven't even seen him since May 2003). He's just here for a night, so we will probably go out for dinner and chill afterwards. Maybe have brunch the next day or something. I'm looking forward to introducing my dad to Jenny. I hope they hit it off. I know he wasn't too fond of my ex. (With good reason I suppose in retrospect)  Isn't it odd how we can worry about the interactions that go on between the people that have us as the mutual relationship? Person A and Person B only know each other because of you (Person C). I will refrain from approximating equasions at this point in order to draw the conclusions that you (the reader) are more than capable of ascertaining without such analogies.  Anywho, one more computer to do tonight, and I am done my mad spree of favours. Since last Friday, I have built 4 brand new computers from scratch, repaired 3 and upgraded 2. Lot's of work, but it's worth it to know that my friends and colleagues aren't going to get ripped off by "the man" when obtaining their computer products and services. *laugh* Oh man. Just read that sentance 5 times in a row. I am such a geek.  Anyways, if you pray, keep my friends Melissa and Angela in your prayers right now. Both are going through their own experiences and in the process of going through them, God has to lead them through some hard places. I'm praying for them, but it can't hurt to throw one or two more prayers out there, eh?  Love and peace everyone.  Rooster
