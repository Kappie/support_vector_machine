We got slightly intoxicated before the movie so we had a short attention span, then half way through the movie we went out smoke (Double the buzz)and luckily Dru and Matt were working so they let us back in.  We then went back and joined Niki for the rest of the movie which from what I saw was moderately funny.  It was basically just a movie full of parodies.  Of course, it had a cliche hollywood ending.  "No Shrek, I want to be with the ogre i married."  That ending could be seen as I saw it though.  Probably just another thing they were doing as a parody of cratacular hollywood ending movies.
