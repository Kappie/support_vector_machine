I was listening to music today before/after my nap, and I came upon one of those songs that like fits my situation.  Except that sometimes things fit situations too well, and that's not necessarily cool.  The weather has been so nice lately.  I think that's why I've been going to the library; for the walk home.  Speaking of walks home from the library, it's so weird how Melody talks for Loren at times, like I saw them (I saw him first), and so I was like "Hi, Loren," (except my throat had some stuff in it that I didn't realize because I hadn't talked since to Niko when school ended), and Melody was like, "Hi, Alex," and we walked past each others.  I say each others because there were two of them.  That was a little awkward; but of course, what isn't with me and those two together?  I always feel bad when Ms. Heidlage tells me to stop talking.  This was during "To Live," and I was actually asking Loren a question relevant to the movie (what this chino thing said on a guy's oh-no-I'm-a-reactionary sign).  W/e.  That's about it.  No quotations since yesterday.  If anyone wants to come with Daniel Waldinger and me to "Bon Voyage" tomorrow (things changed), s/he is welcome.
