Anyways, it hit me; now terrorist are coming to America with their family to disguise themselves. That’s where it got me; are we terrorists? Hmmm . . . I don’t know. We’re suspicious, that’s a FACT! Here’s us; small family of four (starting to wonder) - moves from Concord to ORINDA! (Hmmm, concerned-rate rises) - and live by the Lafayette Reservoir and 1 million gallon water-tower (disaster could happen in a second)! Makes me wonder. Am I a treat to the USA? Well no, I’d be a pussy when it comes to terrorist-shit like that! But still, when government goes through the records, are they gonna stop and say “Wow, Bill! Look at these people. They went from Concord to Orinda, small family, and live by a 1 million gallon-holding water-tower!” Will it be my ass getting cuffed and thrown into a police truck? Well, probably not. But how do you know?
