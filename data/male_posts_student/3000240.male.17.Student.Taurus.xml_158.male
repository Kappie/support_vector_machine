So I shall try to conjure up something remotely worthwhile to ponder over in the short forthcoming absence we shall encounter.  Hmm, well it appears hard just to create something earth shattering at the first attempt, amidst the first minute - let me think for a while.  I have been thinking of Reading, and more directly, the people associated with going, well the old people. Rarely I think about them, but I wish I saw them more. If your by some freak coincidence reading any of this, and it applies to you in any significant relevance, then I hope you appreciate the sentiment.  Anyway, the kick ass polo shirt I paid homage to yesterday has been BuBzified - meaning it now has embraced sweat alloyed into it, but still, or even more so it's funky and always will be.  As for the entertainment I promised -  urlLink enjoy  xBuBzx
