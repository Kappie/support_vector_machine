Okay, there are some great moments, for example, last years performance; the tribute to Joe Strummer were Dave Grohl, Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, and Stevie Van Zandt performed "London Calling" in honor of Joe Strummer. That my friend was amazing. But this year had an EPIC performance! That band would be the one and the only White Stripes. My-friggin'-god, it was ABSO-FRIGGIN'-LUTELY-EPIC. I  almost PISSED myself I was so excited. I mean, I sat there in awe as The White Stripes opened with the first half of Seven Nation Army, then into a couple of riffs of Death Letter, and THEN into some finger-bleeding solos which sounded like they were from the heavy-solo voltage song Ball and Biscuit. Jack White is amazing! He was tearing it APART! After the performance the crowd was giving a standing applause! And of course, my man Quentin Tarantino was in amazement! I'm sorry, I gotta calm down about this performance. If you can, check it out, you'll love it.  Prince, Prince, Prince, Prince, Prince; not too good. Hey, don't get me wrong, Prince rules, but this performance didn't do the job. My first thoughts when I herd Prince was gonna perform was, "Hey, maybe Foo Fighters will do Darling Nikki with him,"  but they didn't. Would have been damn cool, though. He did Purple Rain with Beyonce. He did great guitar, but it still was good.  The Beatles tribute was okay. Half the people performing the song _ , I hated. But it was good. Not much to talk about for it. But no tribute could compare to last years tribute to the late Joe Strummer. Still, I liked it.   Okay, the awards; a whole lot of bad winners and some good. I was glad Coldplay won something like Song of the Year for "Clocks." But I apologize. I wasn't really watching the awards part. I was bummed The White Stripes didn't win Album of the Year for "Elephant." I was SO pissed, 10 minutes before the Grammys I went on Yahoo, and saw in bold, "OUTKAST WINS ALBUM OF THE YEAR!" I was real pissed! Oh well, I kinda like them. Other than that it was good.  Outkast; well, well, well. Their performance was cool! I'm not really into rap, but I do like Run DMC and Beastie Boys, but I like the song "Hey Ya!" They did that and had like the USC or some college band come out on stage to perform. It was good.  Sorry, I'm not commenting on the clothing. I ain't Joan River, hehe. Anyways, the Grammys wasn't too much of a disappointment, but I hope next year will be a little better.
