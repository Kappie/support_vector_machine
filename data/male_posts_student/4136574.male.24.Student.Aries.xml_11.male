I believe anyone really knowing what I feel wouldn't be insulted or feel bad.  I really do intend to help everyone in everything I do.  Okay, so my girlfriend of 3 years dumped me.  OKCupid says she's "The Sudden Departure."  I said the same thing when I met her (not in those words).  It's best to be out, but still very hard.  I was lied to for a long time and I'm trying to deal with how I could let someone treat me like that.  It's not real love when people hide themselves from you.  I don't always blame others.  In my first relationship I just didn't know what went wrong until a year later.  By then I figured I'd been starting fights because I was afraid of commitment.  I made things lousy until she broke up with me.  If I'd known that I could have gotten past it.  Now I'm much more introspective.  Also, I wondered a long time how such deep love as I had back then could go astray.  I thought true love just meant people would last forever.  I learned since then to fight to make relationships work.  So yeah, after that first relationship of a couple years, I was single a long time.  It was a slow recovery.  Then I met Elissa and thought I shouldn't date this person, but I hadn't had anyone else to date for years.  She was flirty and we finally got together despite a rough start.  So yeah, I was improved from my last relationship, but it was too much.  I was all about staying and fixing problems.  I didn't pay attention to when one should leave a relationship.  I let her do horrible things to me without ending it as I should have many times.  So now I'm going to try to be more balanced.  We'll see how that works.  Okay, well my penchant for getting off track is pretty clear now.  I wanted to open this entry by saying Elissa dumped me so I'm starting a new life, and Kelly has been an amazing inspiration to me in tough times.  I wish I had more creative people around me, but, well maybe I just wish I had her around more.  Okay, see I'm already hating saying stuff like that.  Grew up too male?  I don't know, but... yes, losing track again.  So yes, new life, inspired by muse to write.
