In order to encourage more of this, I am going to allow anonymous posts on the blog so everyone can make comments without having to mess with a user name and password.  Whether the topic is politics, movies or sports, keep the dissent coming!   I don't want this site to be a sermon to the choir.  However, if you do post anonymously, consider signing your first name anyway.  I am currently working on Part II of the China Report, but due to my schedule this week it may not be posted until next week.  And now for the most ridiculous item of the day: upon a visit to  urlLink Mitch 's office today, I found him filling out a  urlLink survey  to determine which sci-fi/fantasy character he most closely embodies.  After taking the survey myself, the results indicated that I am  urlLink Yoda !  Imagine that.  Aren't you glad to be reading the blog of such a wise Jedi?
