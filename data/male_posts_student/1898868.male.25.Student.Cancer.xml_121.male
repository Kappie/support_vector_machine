A couple of nights ago claire and I camped on the beach in a place called Manzanita, Oregon (only a couple of miles away from the rocks in Goonies!), and it was probably the sweetest place in the world.  I know a few people on this blog have talked about moving to the pacific northwest at some point, and I'd like to put Manzanita or any of the other 10 or so towns right around there along the coast on the list of places.  I am back in Chicago late Thursday night (the 12th).  Bagel, I would definitely be up for hanging out the night of the 17th, or any of the days after that.  I know that Landon is gonna be in town next weekend, so it would be awesome if you are still around then.  Shafer is gonna be back in town for a few days as well, so I'm sure lots of people might be getting together.  Once again, sweet posts from everybody! I would, however, have liked to hear a little more from stasi on how his dates have been going.  I've been away for about two weeks and so I'm assuming there are at least 5-6 dates to hear about (I'd also like to suggest a sweet Robert Ludlum thriller: The Janson Directive.  While Paul Janson couldn't even hold a candle to Robert Langdon, it's a sweet book.  I'll bet your dad has it - it's by the dude that wrote all of those Bourne books)...
