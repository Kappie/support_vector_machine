They always says that sweet moments don't last , thats what i'm emphasising   I heard rumours and thought about it    well... you're right    I'm just like a lamp post to you     The presents if me when i'm with you   Shine you through the dark,   you didn't cherish my presents,    you took it for granted,    we felt it,   I knew.   when the lamp post lost its ability to shine   what i heard was you somehow felt [lost]    Sorry  for  exposing you but if you really cherish me , i should say that you should start way-back from the start      I've tired but the result is the same      I'm living happily with my current relationship      Whether its too direct or too firm       i should say that I'm not the one for you  with all your visible conditions , i've confident that you can find someone who is patient ,     understands your needs ,      Finally who  you Loves       Best wishes
