I'm at work right now, but I'm headed off on a service call and will be going home after that.  If you plan on making a movie, there's no better tool for doing so than BF1942/Desert Combat/BFV Movie Edition mods at  urlLink Battlefield NL . They have a 6th position in every vehicle that is a camera based around the vehicle, and 4 movement speeds of camera. I don't know how we ever made movies without it. Plus, this movie will be captured with FRAPs, meaning higher resoloution.  I assure you, this movie will be certifiably bad ass in all, ok most, respects.
