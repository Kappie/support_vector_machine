If capitalism were a 300-pound linebacker, I'd be a mangled corpse crammed between him (or her?) and the astroturf.  I want to go to an amusement park. Take me.  I ran to Peacock's General Store and back today. It's just 2 miles, but the road is on a painful incline. The Gatorade cost 2 dollars. It explains why I've never been there before, and why I'll never go there again.  I will be studying for my permit test soon. When I get around to it. (Yes, I am 17. No, I don't have my license.  urlLink Fuck you. )        info.link:  urlLink http://www.avalanchetankers.us/archives/000058.html    [Listening to: A Little Help From My Friends -  urlLink The Beatles  -  (02:44)]
