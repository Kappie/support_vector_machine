That chicken at your house was REALLY good! Ok,then I went to the dance at my school. It was pretty interesting. Mainly just because of all the people that were drunk. And poor Sam. I hope you don't get into too much sh!t! Then after the dance, Stef's dad called Cameron a pervert! lol. He touched her bum! lol. Now on to Saturday. Saturday was pretty interesting. I went camping. With a group called beavers. They are pretty interesting kids. Funny and stupid, but still interesting. lol. So that was that whole day and over-night to Sunday morning. Sunday was ok I guess. I woke up, aching. I was hurting all over. The beavers went home, and I was talking with the leader (which is my dads friend) and I found out that I was getting hours for going. I added all my hours up and found out, that I am done my 40 hours!:D:D:D. So that's my weekend. Now I'm at home, doing nothing at all. Well I'm gonna go now.  Later!
