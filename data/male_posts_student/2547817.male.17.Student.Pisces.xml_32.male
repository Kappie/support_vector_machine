She wants me to let go. I'm not going to do that, but I have to accept that she's not mine anymore. She just told me that there's this gay drama teacher who's getting TOO CLOSE to the students, and I feel like beating the shit out of the homo pervert if he touches her. SEE!There I go again.  I think I've got a crush on this girl in my class, but I keep getting held back by the memories. But I think it's like a small crush lah mike. I think I may have too many requirements. That she should be younger than I, that she shouldn't be Indian, that she should be intellectual, that she should be Christian, that she should have a history of commitment or maybe no history at all but believes in commitment. I'm not sure, if that's too much to ask? And after all these requirements have been fulfilled, am I left with no fish in the sea?  Just spoke to my friend. Realized that many makes treat girls as a commodity. "She's taken", "She's mine"... shit...  We won today's debate- THBT pop culture exploits the weak. And we were the opp, which made our case even harder to fight. Muahahaha!!!  Later
