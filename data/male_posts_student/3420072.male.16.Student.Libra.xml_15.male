I have been meaning to do a blog for a while now and only thought of just now to do it.  well many things have happend throughout my life some things i am ashamed of and some things ive found quite funny.  lets start some where i am 16/17 soon. my parents a divorced and i like anything anime or to do with the computer. i am a gamer but a pritty crap one at that even though people say ii am good i still think i could be better. I cant spell and am no good a grammer.  many things have happend through out my life and i dont like to dwell on the bad stuff but people alwyas say that is the best things to read about so my page might be boring but i dont care i just want to releive my thoughts people who dont like that can stick it.  i was teased alot at my school befor my current one so when i moved school i felt releived stuff like that can really put you down.  life love and romance i think people like well i have the life thing down so i'll have to work on the other two.  i am currently doing cisco and it essentials at school wich i have a keen intrest in but my fav subject by far is media studies latly i am not doing the latest assign ment because the teacher wants me to learn this program he got and seeing that everyone asks me for help in the class including the teacher i felt like i should plus i think its fun.  if i were to state my life in three words i couldnt i have to many tjhings to talk about but i've decided to keep it in the present and see how things progress from there.  well i will post more but first i thin k i will play some games and music stay tuned for more talse of INTEREST!!! :)
