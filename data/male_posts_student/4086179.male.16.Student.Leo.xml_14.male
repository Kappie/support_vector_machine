THAT WAS THE  BEST cos  they showed me at the winter sleepout, and i can do it too. there were lots of singers and they were all good too, and there were lots of other good acts too. but then there was the 2 chicks at the end of the whole thing. OH MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THESE GIRLS WERE... OH MY GOSH. like unless you were there you got no idea how good these girls are... gees. gift from god, its all there is to it. they are in year nine and one of the girls is 2 levels of professional. well all inall it was a good night.
