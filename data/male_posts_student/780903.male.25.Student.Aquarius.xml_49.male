Good that these activities exist.  A little worried I'm biting off more than I can handle.  But no problems yet.  I'll wait and see how my schedule looks once things have actual meeting times.  I took my mess of Microsoft Word class notes and turned them into the beginnings of neat and organized course outlines.  Here's the before and after:   BEFORE   Contracts notes for Sept. 18 ----- professor says contracts are good.... student in third row wearing green shirt says no..... contracts are always enforceable ---- never --- sometimes.... maybe... **this is very important** page 143, second paragraph from the middle.  Justice Rehnquist on contracts.....  tomorrow we will continue and look at the next case... bring the supplementary textbook....   AFTER   I. Contracts are good ---A. No --------1. Enforceable ------------a. Green shirt ----------------i. Justice Rehnquist --------------------(a) tomorrow  See?  Much better!
