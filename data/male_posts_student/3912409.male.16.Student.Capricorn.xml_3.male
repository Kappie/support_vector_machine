By the time the tennis match was over it was about 2:00 - 2:30 and after that.... I kinda just watched some more TV...     Later, I got one of those survey things from BJ.... and it was 178 questions long! So after reading it I filled it out meself... lol and I think it ended up taking me an hour or so to fill it out. And much much later... Cookie finally got on MSN, so we started talking. Then Cookie sent me her survey thing, so I read that. And after that she sent me yet another little survey type thing, it was just about how much I knew her and that kind of stuff. lol but what was scary is that we had so many of the same answers :p... and after that BJ sent me the same thing, and I called him slutty and said he'd marry George W. Bush (HA! got him back for you Cookie).      Ok, I said that I'd put this in, because Cookie wrote this just for me............ and BJ I guess....     Twas a normal day in the land or Tir na knogg.. The hens were out pecking at the grain... the pigs were bathing in their bowls of mud and other great substances.     Twas the same day the small girl decided to venture into the world, decided to treat that day, the day she came of age, as a very special day.    Slowly she stepped away from the small cottage that had been of hers and her fathers for the duration of her life. She had only ever ventured meer steps away from it's safe walls, but today was her 15th birthday and she decided to do that of a different sort.    Slowly she walked towards the rickety fence that held that of an ass and steed. Carefully she coaxed the horses closer, she ridden him many times in the small dirt ring by her home, but never into town. Carefully she brushed him out, and then put on his bridle. Hiking her skirts up she mounted him bareback, her cloak flowing out behind her like that of a cape. Expertly she turned the horse, did a couple of warm up excercises, then raced down the gravel road in the direction of town.    Soon she was in the small town of Tir na Knogg, many shops and people bustled about. Never before had she seen anyone other then her father, and his mistress who occasionally visited from the small town. She had heard many stories of the town, but it was different then she had expected. Carefully she took in the sounds of the voices, and the clip clopping of hoof on cobblestone. She listened to the melodic splashing of the fountain that sat in the middle of the town, a circlular road running around it. Shops sat all along the road, people approaching them, and leaving them. People of all different statures and appearances, some leaving with goods, others leaving looking rather out of it. Slowly she glanced around at all the other horses, and then walked her mount over to the shop with the wooden sign with the insignia of a fork and knife.     She dismounted and tied the horse next to that of a small pony, on the hitching post. "You wait here Ganalon." She whispered in the horses ear, as she stroaked his thick dark neck.    Carefully she opened the door, taking in with anticipation the sights, smells, and sounds. Ancey and excited she walked over to the bar, her body shaking with excitement so that she had to grip onto the wooden counter to keep herself from falling down. The barista came over, cleaning a wooden tankard on the gringey apron that was tied around her hip.     "What can I do you for, luv." She said in a thick accent, her frizzy blond braids falling down over her shoulders across her chest as she rested one leg, and leaned on the opposing hip.    Smiling with deep excitement, anticipation bubbling in her like water in a cauldron over a hot fire. Taking a deep breath in and exclaimed...                                                                        "Get me one bowl of mushroom and macaroni soup."     Ummm... not much else happened today.... except for talking to Cookie for awhile about.... stuff?.... AND WES!!! DIDN'T I ASK YOU TO GET ME A DRINK?!?!?!
