     
      I feel so empty today. I'm laying here on my couch, basking the halogen glow of my basement lighting. My basement is a mess, and in desperate need of decorating. I'm surrounded by these things...magazines on music and art and politics, books on religion and war. Soda Cans and plates with some sort of dried up sauce on them. At first glance, it must appear as if I'm a rather intelligent person. The type of person who, though a little sloppy, is creative and will one day make a big name for himself. Nothing could be further from the truth. I am uninspired and unmotivated. There's much I would like to accomplish, but what for? I guess we all feel like we have nothing to live for sometimes.   It's been a while since I've genuinely smiled. I laugh sometimes, at work or with friends, but there's always something fake about it. Something...forced.    she has to love music. and the somewhat eccentric.
