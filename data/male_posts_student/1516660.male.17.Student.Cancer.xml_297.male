As time goes by, I got into the game quickly. HaHa! Me and HL was in a group together, the rest another. HaHa! In the end, our group won! We played 3 games total ma. We won once by skills and the other by default (they shoot the cue ball in after the black ball, which is not allowed). Heh! We enjoyed ourselves today. I then rushed back to watch Survivor.  I did not rush back for nothing. At first, I was afraid for Rupert being voted out, because the whole tribe seemed to dislike him or something. However, things changed dramatically. Jenna announced at the Immunity Challenge that she wanted out. Her cancer-stricken mother is in a very bad shape, and Jenna is really regretting her decision to come to All-Stars. She wants to be there by her mother. "I got a gut feeling my mother needs me, my father needs me, everyone needs me". She left the game. She did the right thing. Her mother died 8 days after she returned. She did the right thing man! This goes to show the strong bond (her gut feelings) between family members. My respect for Jenna went up several notches. Go Jenna! She's a true Survivor.   As you can se, I felt very touched, that's why I chose to write about this now. :)  Alright, I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
