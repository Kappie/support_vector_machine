To begin this morning I want to talk about the dreams I had the last few days.  Just last night, I dreamt about being, of all things, an astronaunt.  It was a very weird dream (but dreams are normally weird), I'd say.  It began, as far back as I can remember, with me inside the space shuttle.  It wasn't exactly the space shuttle though, from the inside.  In the inside, it looked more like a bus.  Then, as we landed in Dallas, I think as I rememberd the flight attendant say something about Dallas faintly.  We then oddly got on a bus, but before actually getting on the bus I didn't know it was a bus.  I first thought it was the actual shuttle I would take off on.  It had that astronaunt like walkway in front of it, just like the real shuttles have, I think.  It was weird.  Then, after getting off this bus, I went in my parents car and that's when I woke up.  A very weird dream.  I never thought anything about being an astronaunt one bit.  The other dream I want to talk about, I had Saturday night.  This, to date, is the weirdest dream I have ever had.  All I can really remember about this dream is that it was in the desert and the main thing of the dream was that we (who else, I don't know) drove around the desert on a road and frequently stopped and someway loaded this cart of creamfilled hotpockets in a cart.  It was the grossest thing ever.  To this day, I have this nasty taste of just biting into a dozen of those stupid creamfilled things just like a Hostess (sp?) cake snack.  That's really sickening.  It makes me wonder what's going on inside my head.  Today marks the first day of the brand new trimester at school.  I hope to get off to a good start.  Previously I have slacked off a lot and have not really cared much about school and with the new trimester I hope to change this.  I really do hope.  I aim at making a consious effort to keep good grades.  I'm not sure at all if I am going to actually get good grades, but I figure I should give it a try.  Who knows what could happen.  I could actually get good grades.  I believe that I have the capability to get good grades, it's just that I don't want it that bad.  I guess it had never meant that much to me to open the report card and see the fruit of hard labor.  I never really cared about good fruit.  So, I suppose you could say I'm now going for some good fruit this season.  That's all for now.  Have a good day.
