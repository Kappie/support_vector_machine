To top it off most of my friends are going places. I'd feel bad that I wasn't asked but since both they and I know that I wouldn't be able to go anyways I don't really. It just means there's noone to talk to. Oh, and last I heard my girlfriend is working today. So bad day for me all around. Can't even write a decent Blog....  Tired of it all,  -Dant
