It has a crappy timeslot though... 9 PM - 10 PM on Thursday nights. I only caught the begining of it, because I went to the UCI Pub last night for some drinking with Derek and Alex. They were playing a lot of X and Social D there last night.  Something that really trips me out is whenever I drive down Bryan Ave. It's  urlLink suburban sprawl . I remember Bryan Ave, when it was all orange groves. Now it is all homes, and all the trees are now gone. Endless expansion, more homes, more retail, and more pollution social and environmental. Suburban sptawl... it's endless construction... yet instead of more space, there's less of a sense of place. Traffic intensifies and it takes longer to get from point A to point B and you're trapped in the limbo that is your car. Yet we buy into this...  People keep saying that want to visit me at work... nice of them.  ***
