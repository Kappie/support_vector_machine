If you want details about my dates, you are going to have to talk to Shafer.  I will also use this space to display my love for one Dan Brown.  The man not only wrote about esteemed symbologist Robert Langdon, but also took on NASA in Deception Point, and the NSA in Digital Fortress.  Digital Fortress is a must read for anyone who uses the internet and is worried that the government might know what you are doing (well that is at least what was stated on the book jacket).
