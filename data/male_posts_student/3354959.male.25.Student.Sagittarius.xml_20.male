So here, in no particular order, are the people I saw:  Michael Moore lookalike Larry Larry's girlfriend, Lauren (I like to call them Lauren and Lawrence...that's precious) Mithu Steve David Meg Erika A bunch of drunk NIH kids I've never met A bunch of sober guys in suits I've never met, all of whom looked pissed off as hell A guy applying to med school who loved (LOVED) to listen to himself talk about how much  he knew about med schools, what it takes to get in, who he knows at which schools...I wanted to vomit down his throat.  Melissa  Beth Noah Ali Rosanna Karen  There you have it.
