I got up and didn't get ready until 11:30. My mom brought home Garlic Cheese Bread from Little Ceasors. It was yummy. Then I got ready, and went over to Kyles. From there we went to Nancys, K-Mart, Walmart. We were trying to find a camo shirt for him. But we couldn't find any. So then we went back to his house where I beat him in pool. Yes, I won in pool its amazing I know. After that I went home and then Aimee came and picked me up to go to the cherry festivle. I didn't ride any rides. My moto is "if the person running the ride is missing teeth, I'm not riding it." So that means all the rides were out of the picture so I didn't go on any. It saved me 10 bucks so that was a plus. But then Aimee had to leave because she had to get up early to go to work, so I went and hung out with Haley, Jenny, Abby, Roxanne, Ele, and Julie to watch Heroes By Nite. They are a great band. Amazing 3 out of the 4 came from Washington. And the other he might of, he is from around here I know that, he just went to Peoria Christian. But they were amazing. All thier songs were original. Which is hard to come by these days. But after two songs, they were starting to talk about God and how he was good. And then Alan just screams out "Show us your boob!" This is right when Kyle Yocum the main singer goes we are here tonight for God, and then you here Alan go "Show us your boob!" Well this was oviously very out of place. And everyone laughed for a second and then just gave him evil stars. So he left. But after the concert, his mom was looking for him. And she was screaming for him lol. I was wierd. And right now, I'm talking to Haley and she said he was caught by the cops up at the square. That's one crazy kid. But go check out Heroes By Nite. They are amazing. I'm hoping they are going to play again in Washington, and then I'll buy one of their CDs next time. I should of got one this time. Oh well, if anyone has it, you would be awesome if you would let me make a copy of it. Alright, well I'm tired. Nite.
