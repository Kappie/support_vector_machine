I was looking forward to having a relaxing day but of course I knew that wasn't gonna happen and while I was on the computer my mom went to go to the bank and the car wouldn't start. So then we hed to wait for the tow truck dude to come and THEN we had to go to the car place and wait for TWO HOURS until it was ready. Then when I finally got home I was able to relax. I talked to Stacey on the phone and on AOL and I also talked to Stacey's friend Brittany. She seems pretty nice and I am always happy to make a new friend lol. Well thats pretty much it today. Bye.
