Expect more of the same stuff, with added insults.  I'm even going to post parts of peoples' blogs, and then make fun of them specifically!  Remember, it's all in good fun, though, and if your blog just so happens to turn up here, its all intended to be funny, and probably not serious...at least 90% of the time.  If I really think your blog is bad, then you'll know it.  So, anyway, let's get going.   urlLink Blog Blog Blog!  Rating: *  You may remember in the last installment of Late Night Bloggin', I reviewed a blog called "Blog Blog Blog," which led me to post the lyrics to the Ren and Stimpy song, "Log log log."  Well, this is another blog called Blog Blog Blog, and I'm not going to post the lyrics.  Sorry.  This blog sucks.  His main focus, I guess, is to bash President Bush and everything that he does, and also talk about politics.  Well, let me just say this: it's too damn annoying.  Who cares about politics that much?  I mean, yeah, Bush isn't the best President we have had, and I think Kerry deserves to win, but this guy just overstretches it, and has since he started the blog back in May.  This makes me stop and think, do we really need blogs like this in the blogging world, or is it a waste of Blogger's space, just like Blog of Bagel might be?  Well, I'm going with the second option.  It's okay once in a while to talk about the politics, if you're older and have nothing better to do than post what you think of our president on the internet, but, for anyone else, it's pointless to read, especially with a catchy, interesting title such as Blog Blog Blog.  You'd think that this would be some teenager's blog, but no, it's a politics junkie.  And that's just grand.  And do note the sarcasm.  Sorry dude, but, you need to stop focusing on politics and the world and start writing something just a little bit better, something that might interest teenagers, which more than likely create at least 51% of Blogger's userbase.   urlLink The Blog in My Own Eye  Rating: **  This one is just a little bit better.  Yes, it's got all the political crap that the first one has, and more.  This guy actually does talk about stuff that isn't directly related to politics or world news.  He talks about his life, how he hates yard work, his job interview, crap like that.  But, this blog is still incredibly boring.  Like most blogs these days, this one uses one of the Rounders styles that are available on Blogger (and I'm even thinking about moving this blog to one of them very soon).  It's not a bad thing, but, eventually, the Rounders style is going to wear out, and people will be using this style more.  Anywho.  The way this guy writes his stuff is much better than the style of the guy who I rated above.  Now, I've had enough political crap.  So, that's it for this blog.  Tomorrow, I'm going to be working at the school again, so I'm not going to be around until tomorrow afternoon.  I need to get some sleep, because I'm going in early to work in guidance, since they requested my services, swamped as they are.  I'm getting good community service for working up there, and its definitely needed.  My new goal for community service is at least 250 hours, which should surpass practically everyone in my senior class.  I think right about now, I'm nearing 200.  So, maybe I can even pull off 300.  If I can do that, then that's great.  I'm going to keep going with the Interact club, maybe the Key Club, and I'm going to keep working towards it.  As far as working pictures for the baseball team goes for this next year, right now, I'm saying no, but, that could change.  It was a good experience for me working with them last year, but, I don't know if I'm up to it again this year.  But, we'll see how things go.  This new baseball coach is going to be my English teacher this year, so, if he requests me, I'll say yes, but, otherwise, I'm not going to bring it up.  That's it for me for today.  I'll be back tomorrow afternoon with more crap for you to read!  Until then, adios.
