as he was filling out the photo form thingy... i think i threw him off when i actually said 716. it'd be interesting to know if people thought i wascrazy or being funny or whatever when that happens. i can't help it... i've just been programmed by new york... like the times i'm tempted to pull out an umbrella when it starts raining...  hmmm... what else... oh... so as i was driving today... i thought about how you can access and maybe even assess people's lives (to a certain extent) through the rear-view mirror of your car. it's like a secret window into other people's lives. you can catch people doing some weird things @ traffic lights. it's kinda cool i guess... being able to observe spiecies in their "natural" habitats. that girl or guy in front of you can do the same thing... so maybe next time when you're in a car... do something really strange when you're stopped @ a light... you might make someone laugh and make their day... and give em a new story to tell friends.  so here's some big  urlLink news ... molson  coors are merging. buffalo is a labatt city... and even though i don't ever really drink anymore... on the rare occasions that i do... beer-wise... it's pretty much always been labatt...and on even rarer occasions... molson's have been in the mix. those are pretty much the only choices... when having beer... need canadian beer... and if that's the case... those are 2 that are readily available here. thereis onething i have to give credit to molson for though... the "i am canadian" ad campaign from awhile back. i was kinda sad when the molson centre was renamed to the bell centre... cause you can't get much more canadian than hockey and beer... and that was just a good combo. i guess i'm kinda sad about this merger... i hope coors doesn't screw things up... labatt was folded into interbrew a couple years ago... but... interbrew is a pretty large international brewing company... so... i think they'd give more leeway to the people running their subdivisions to just run them like they've always done. coors on the otherhand... is pretty much contained in the US... i just hope they don't get the "we always know what's right" attitude that so much of america subscribes to... and not mess up a good product.  i just read this yesterday... turns out amc isturning  urlLink private ... interesting how there was a big explosion of theaters just a couple years ago... and now... a bunch are being shuttered... and cineplex's are merging or being bought out. amc is in pretty good shape though... i'm just disappointed i didn't invest in the stock... it's quite volatile... and if i were to have bought and sold @ the correct times... i probably could've retired in thefrom theyears that i played with the stock or something =].  here's some good  urlLink news ... air america radio network is doing better... and has stabalized a bit. whatever puts us closer to getting o'rielly off the air... is better. al franken is a funny guy too!  here's a link to a strange  urlLink pic ...  hopefully buffalo can draw people with health sciences and business  urlLink skills ... or keep them in the area after they graduate. we need to build a base to take off on.  i will shoot myself if i see another six flags commercial... and speaking of commercials that piss me off... the west-herr guy auto group guy... and that chevy year end clearance commercial... with the bigtractor truckandhow it's hitched truck bed is all sliding down a parking lot up to a dealer... i can't explain it any better (sorry for those who haven't seen it... or should i not apologize cause it's just that bad)... but it's just annoying... cause who would ever do that? plus it looks totally fake.  that's all for now... hope you all have a good friday.
