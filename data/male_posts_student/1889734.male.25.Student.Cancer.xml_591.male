I thought I'd try to get some conversation going on books by providing another edition of What I'm Reading.  I happen to have four books going right now, which is pretty unusual for me.  First.   urlLink  Pandoras Star   I actually started this book some time ago, put it down to make room for Broken Angels, and then came back to it.  This is my 'lunch' book, read during my lunch break here at work, so that's one of the reasons it's going slow.  Peter Hamilton is a great SF author, and the Night's Dawn Trilogy (actually 6 books) is a great romp in hard SF on an epic scale.  I would like to live in his imagination.  However, Pandoras Star seems a little scattered and disjointed.  I'm on page 500, and things are still a little confused for me.  I'm going to stick with it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else unless you are already a fan of Hamilton.  Second.   urlLink  Guns Up!    This was loaned to me by a guy here at work who happens to share an interest in war.  It's a paperback, so I'm reading it as my 'breakfast' book - meaning it is easy to stash in the pockey of my lab coat and take to the morning break, where I sneak a few extra minutes reading.  It's quick and interesting, following a Machine Gunner during his experience in Viet Nam.  You've probably heard that the average lifespan of a gunner in Nam was seven seconds after the shooting starts.    Third.   urlLink  Honor's Blade    Yes, a Star Trek book.  This is a guilty pleasure for me.  It's actually a collection of four books bound as one (purchased from the SF Book Club), containing My Enemy My Ally, The Romulan Way, Swordhunt and Honor's Blade.  Diane Duane wrote these quite some time back, laying out her version of the Romulan Empire, and I still wish they had adopted her work as the official version of the Romulan society.  The way they are portrayed in ST:TNG is just bad.  This is my 'read at home' book at the moment, since I don't want to lug Pandoras Star back and forth each day.  Fourth.   urlLink  1633    This is an eBook I downloaded for free through the Baen Free Library.  I read it on my iPaq before meetings (or sometimes during meetings) or any other moment where there is a lull.  Problem is - it's HORRIBLE.  1633 is a sequel to, oddly enough, 1632.  It's another schlock time travel story where a coal mining town in West Virginia is mysteriously transported to 1632, smack in the middle of Europe during the Thirty Years War.  The writer is a self-described Marxist, and former Union organizer in West Virginia.  So you have a cast of characters that read like a roster from the Democratic Convention, trying to impose Leftist values on 17th century Europe.  There is some crotchety old 60's hippy who tries to prevent them from building a military, or wants to negotiate with the European powers, rather than fight.  There is an industrial magnate who ended up in this small town during the transfer (his son was getting married), and he's the heavy - primarily because he has the right ideas about how to build a functioning society based upon profit.  Can't have that!  I read 1632 because it was free, and it made me laugh.  I'm not quite sure why I'm reading 1633, except for the completely insane social commentary.  So, there we have it.  Anyone else reading something worth talking about?
