Ok ok back to what had happened to me in school.     Woke up really today cause i was enjoying hehehe this dream i had. OK! OK! i had a wet dream! like so what! hahaha luckily never wet the whole bed only wet my underwear hahaha! Well i dreamt about me having a threesome withAsh, Daniel and Me! hahaha strange eh (don't ask me what happened ok! cencord).. hahahaDaniel if you are reading this please please please please forgive me! Please forgive me! I rushed too school, did not comb my hair, did not zipped up my pants properly but luckily i noticed about the zip before i entered school.      Well skipped the part about school, so the boring. Well after school i had practice for my Racial Harmony Day: Indian Dance competition. Yeah! We got into the Finals.. all thanks to me, hahaha, with my two solos. We practiced and made changes. There are some problems with my costume because i don't have a costume so i decided to wear my white track pants which look like traditional maleindian costume with self made banggels on my legs. I don't know for the top, i can't be topless i don't like to be topless infront of a lot of people. Well that is in process. So is the 1-2minutes speech about the dance. Wellhere is the speech that i will be saying lor.     Good morning Ladies and Gentle, Ms Cheah, Mr Appolos and my fellow friends. As you can see from my costume, banggels, make-up and bright coloured tops. Well i represent a powerful Immortal. The dance you going to watch soon has a storyline behind it which you have to think about.
