School's over and everything, but it seems like i don't have much time to go to the pool, see movies, er hang out with friends. My summer started of on some kinda foot, but it sure wasn't the right one.       It started with a summer jazz band thing at school. My director played it out to be something incredibly fun with a trip to cedar point at the end of it all. Well, to say the least, it wasn't all that great; it wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great. We practiced some good music (most of the time) and we got about and hour each day to do whatever we wanted (to a certain extent...heh). But, the other time was spent watching these dumb videos, and in the end there was no trip because not enough ppl were willing to pay the money, or didn't already have plans. If it isn't already obvious, i don't plan on doing it again next year, but who knows, i might get sucked into it again.   After the jazz thing, i stained my grandma's fence. She paid me $200 for it, but it was a pain in the ass, the back, the legs, and the arms. I had to power wash it, and then i had to stain it with this oil based wood protector stuff that was like brown water. I finally finished it after about 15 or so hours. Now she wants me to stain her deck and paint the benches. I'll definitely be relieved when this is all over with.      On July 12th, i went to the oral surgeon to get my wisdom teeth pulled. It sounds simple enough, but it was terrible. I was told in the waiting room that i would get some local and some nitros, but after the 50 local shots all in my mouth, the doctor let me sit for a while to numb up, and he started. I would have asked him about the gas, but i couldn't talk very well with a numb tongue and lips. He just started pulling away. It started with a simple wiggle and pull, but it gradually went from there, to wiggle-tug-pull-pull, to wiggle-yank-wrench-pull, to drill-pull-wrench-yank. I heard and smelled some of the worst things in that short period of time. #1 worst sound: crunching/splintering teeth inside your mouth. #1 worst smell: burning tooth stuff. After it was all over, i had to eat mush for three or four days. The holes where my teeth used to be are still there collecting food. If you have to get your wisdom teeth pulled, you probably shouldn't have read this, but oh well; the damage is done for now. (The rest of the damage will come when you actually get you wisdom teeth out.)      After i got my wisdom teeth out. My mom started a project in the front room of the house (Kitchen, dining, and living room is all one room). She sarted by painting the celing and it snowballed. Now we have finished painting the celing and the walls, patching the crack in our concrete floor, putting down new floor in the kitchen, and leveling the cabinets. The Lowe's people come to lay carpet within a week from now...i think, and we have to put down baseboards after they finish. To say the absolute least, our front room is a mess- bare concrete no baseboards, unpainted trim. It sucks.      Hope my summer gets better. I've only been to the pool twice so far, which is really terrible if you know where i live in relation to it. Maybe by the time school gets back in on the 26th of August, i'll have more free time...heh, yeah.
