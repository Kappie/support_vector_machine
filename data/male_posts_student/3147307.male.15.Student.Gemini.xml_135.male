We went to this really old general store (like 150 years old) and they also had really old food and drink. Mountain Dew's that had expired in December, brownies that expired in April, etc. Anyways, after that it was only me, Dan, Jon, and Joel that kept going. Lot of fun. But many, many extremely tough hills (one where you walk your bike up type). We ended up going like 37 miles.  Everywhere - Tim McGraw  "Saddam Captured; Colts make playoffs." Headlines from the newspaper at the general store.  "God made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of God." - 2 Corinthians 5:21 (one of many verses I need to memorize before Sunday)
