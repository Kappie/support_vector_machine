I've been wondering where my other songs went, there's so many songs I remember having, and don't remember deleting. Meh. I'm such a confused, sad, happy boy right now. And I say the "F" word a lot. The drinking has subsided, though, and the bottles of alcohol that previously littered my floor are now stacked neatly on a shelf, waiting till the day when I need them again. Hopefully next time I drink it will be for social reasons, and not to escape. I got a speeding ticket in the mail today, and I would like to shoot a policeman. There is a major flaw with our traffic system, and that is that a Semi-trailer can go the same speed as a compact car. This defeats the purpose of limits. The limit should be measured either in a)The amount of forward momentum carried by the vehicle, or b) Braking distance (my car will be able to stop a HELL OF A LOT FASTER THAN A FUCKING SEMI TRUCK). I should write my local MLA. Yes I should.
