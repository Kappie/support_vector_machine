Had a couple of friendlies round tonight for a chinwag, and we ended up playing silly games with the Japanese exchange student we have here. Reading random phrases, calling each other things like "chimneysweep" and being generally silly.  We should do this again sometime! I think I might post a few Japansese words. This is how they sound if you say them in English, with a bit of a different pronunciation.  menace = komarimono pregnant female / animal = ninshin shite iru homeless = no nai hobble = wo hiku scapegoat = miga-wari  Have fun discussing these around the dinner table!
