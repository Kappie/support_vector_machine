Well it’s complicated (too complicated for many) for I am the new War editor of Jimtopia. I report on all the crap weather it be secret Iraqi movements(I will tell you the correct pronunciation later) to the ever raging war between the evil Jug Milk radicals and the good non communists, non brain stealing, regular tasting cardboard milk. Now you’re thinking this is going to suck just like everything else on Jimtopia, right. Well you probably are right. So listen to my crap because I know all. You don’t get a position like War editor on Jimtopia by doing nothing in your life. I know all.  Enough about that other crap I was saying. Now let’s get down to the dealings of me, and me only.  I believe you all know about the groundhog and how he saw his shadow. Well many credible sources including myself, have determined that the Ground Hog and the Iraqi’s are related. How are they related you ask? Well for one, they both had to be smoked out of their dirty spider caves like the primal beasts they are. That means there the same horrible bests who posses the power to corrupt all. Many of you have previously thought that the ground hog was a medieval best that was primarily used to determine the length winter. Well fact actually is that the groundhog has been playing you common folk for many a year, playing you like spoons in fact. The truth is that the ground hog is an evil device used to spy on the types of car we use, that way they can determine the price of oil. Now you scream with rage about what I’ve told you. Well don’t go crazy like a certain Jug Milk sympathizer I know. (You know who I’m talking about) I have a plan. I have a great plan that’s even better than actually making a low fat type of food that actually tastes like food. My plan is to send all of our Nuclear Titan missiles to Iraq and blow them up. This will kill of the Iraqi people and possibly any other type of ground animal living there, unless these ground animals live in a really deep spider cave, at which point they must be smoked out of their holes and brutally blown to pieces. After we are done blowing up stuff we will be free to steal the oil thus cutting gas prices by 60%, saving people an average estimated sum of 3 dollars a year. We will be able to use these three dollars to spend on the stock market and make it good again. See it’s a win-win situation for all. Don’t you wish all War reporting was as informative as this.
