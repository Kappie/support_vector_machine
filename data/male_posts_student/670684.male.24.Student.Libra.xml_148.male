Here's Rachel Corrie, the girl slain by the Israeli tractor,  urlLink minutes after being run over .  And a story about  urlLink her group dedicated to nonviolence .   The world is an incredibly fucking disgusting place at the moment.  George Bush, at Monday's facade of an ultimatum, you just shat on it even more.  No, I'm not an apologist for Saddam Hussein...he's pissing on the pile as well.  Why does this game of Who Has The Bigger Dick have to be violent?
