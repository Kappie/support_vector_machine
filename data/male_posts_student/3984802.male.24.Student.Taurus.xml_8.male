I went to a wedding reception this evening with Masha. When I got home two of my roommates were not home; only Ross was here, and he soon went to bed. I came into my room and began changing out of my Sunday clothes and I sat down to take off my shoes. Then I just sat there. It was quiet. There was no T.V. on. There was no music playing. There was no roommate talking his head off. It was just quiet. And I sat there and thought about things. And it was peaceful and calming and relaxing. It really felt good.  I think it is really important to take advantage of those moments, as they seem to become more and more rare. It is important to take time to reflect on things and it just doesn't happen with noise. I think one of the mistakes I make is playing instrumental music or classical music, and thinking that that counts. Don't get me wrong, I think listening to that music is great, but I realized tonight that it does not beat silence sometimes. Silence really is beautiful in my opinion. Unfortunately, my roommate has come home now and has the T.V. on. Like I said, silence is rare. Mine only lasted about half an hour.  Anyway, what did I sit and think about? The reception, of course. What else? It was really wonderful. The bride looked beautiful and they just seemed so excited and happy and at peace. I always seem to think, when I go to these things, "why isn't that me?" You know what I mean? I often think, there's a really nice girl... I could be happy with someone like that, why am I still single and someone else is marrying her? I don't know if anyone else ever thinks like that, but it always seems to get me thinking.  The reception itself was really nice. Some things I liked about it: It was held the night before the wedding. There is definitely a different feeling when they are not yet married. They are not exhausted physically and emotionally yet. They are still full of excitement and adrenalin, as they are not yet married. They aren't sitting there thinking about (worrying about) what they are going to do as soon as they leave the reception. I also think there is some kind of feeling of sadness at receptions usually. It is kind of like, oh, they are married now and are moving on, leaving us. But the night before you aren't really feeling that yet. Again, it is just more of an excited feeling. Another thing I really liked was not that fact that they had a line, but the fact that it was only the two of them in the line. I didn't have to shake hands and make small talk with ten other people that I really don't even care to talk to. I mean, who really wants to talk to the parents and all of the bridesmaids? If you do, go find them and talk to them. Don't make everyone do it. Another thing was that they had this guy sitting at the keyboard playing and singing Ben Fold's Five, Counting Crows, and other music. Very nice touch. I loved it. It was fancy but there was just an informal feeling. We just had desserts, but they were really good. Mmm.  We left in a hurry because Masha was supposed to go to her Yoga class at 9.00 pm. Well, that didn't happen. There was this terrific thunder storm that hit us on our way home. It was spectacular! There was so much lightning flashing all around us, which was beautiful. Then the rains came pouring down in torrents. It was raining so hard that we could hardly even talk to each other without yelling. I could barely see where I was going at some points. We had to crawl along the freeway at about 20 mph. It was quite the storm. We enjoyed it.  I had a good time tonight. It was nice to spend some time out with someone. Even though it wasn't a date, it was just nice to go and spend time with someone that I don't normally do stuff with. Kind of refreshing.  Well, I am still kind of struggling with this sickness. I thought I was getting better but now I am  not so sure. I wasn't feeling to great today. So, I should probably get to bed now so that I can try and get over this.  P.S. I decided yesterday that I am not going to take the MCAT again in August. I just am not prepared and so it isn't worth it. It feels like a big load off my shoulders. If I end up not getting accepted anywhere, then I will just have to take it again in April, at which point I will be much better prepared, and apply again next year. So that's that.
