And the one to the right is me in the second grade of Videregaaende Skole @ Mosjoen. I have yet to get a decent picture of myself showing how I currently look like, but as soon as I get one, it's up on the site.  Tomorrow I'm making tortilla. Can't wait, my mouth is watering already. Think I'll try to jog my way up the mountain we live by, seeing as bikeing up there is totally out of the question!  My tummyache is over now, although I still get a few rumblings from time to time.  My little brother is home from Norway Cup now and his team lost heavily :-/. They didn't even win one match, and he got his knee hurt(again).  Well, at least he was satisfied with the scenery... All the hot chicks that is. And I know what he's talking about. Whiplash!  I got 99 problems...
