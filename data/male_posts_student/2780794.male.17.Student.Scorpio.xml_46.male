This was quoted by albert Einstein which tells us how imbalanced this world is~ There are juz too many evil people in this world and those who do aniting abt it may juz get outnumbered and lose out~ And itz not tat ez to do "aniting abt it"... haiz~ juz guez life's hard~   Life starts lyk an electron orbitting itz nucleus, spinning continuously lyk a magnetic dipole, Each and evri1 of us is as insignificant as mucus, yet many still stand out as tho they got big assholes!
