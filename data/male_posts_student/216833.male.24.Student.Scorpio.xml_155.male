I already developed the pics but left them in lodi. After that I saw jeremy's band practice. very fucking good. I was totally impressed by the sheer fucking change. I'm a fan for sure.  The day after mimi, darrel, and I went to look at 10.5 acres of land we were thinking of buying. That was fun, the land was super rad.  Thanksgiving 'shopping' weekend has not been to bad. I thought it was going to be a bit overwhelming. not at all.  I got a new game. Abalone, very fun. I just need to get GO and I will board game happy. A hiking I will go Tuesday. Somewhere, maybe Mount St. Helena.   Vodka vanilla coke rules my drunk ass.   current mood:  drunk current music: Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds - Ain't Gonna Rain Anymore
