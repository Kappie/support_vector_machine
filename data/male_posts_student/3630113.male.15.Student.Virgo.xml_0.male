It really is quite impeccable, this feeling of mine...the other time..couple of weeks ago...i just thought that something would happen...i knew it was impossible...but somehow it stuck to my mind and i couldn't get it out of my mind. It just clung on for the rest of the day...until nighttime when i realised that it really occurred. This has been the case of various incidents over the past weeks..it really is quite amazing.  Just a couple of days ago...on saturday afternoon..it suddenly occurred to me that sweden and the dutch would draw in a match 0-0..and the dutch would finally triumph in penalties...though i wasn't able to predict the penalty score ultimately. However, i woke up the next morning i found that it was exemplified by reality! Just today..i wanted to wake up at 330 to catch the czech-danish encounter..but well i just kept slacking on bed..but somehow perhaps in my dreams or something like that(was in a state of sub-consciousness) i predicted that czechs had won 3-0. Somehow something told me that rosicky score. OMG. czechs won 3-0. but rosicky didnt' score. geez. this is getting more and more freaky.   I promised myself i won't let this astnoshing occurrence, even if it does recur, to help me with placing bets or something along those lines...and perhaps it may just break the entire "chain of thought" that has been coming to me. Perhaps i just want to preserve the beauty of it...and perhaps find out why it has been coming to me...and allow even more miracles to happen.   Perhaps my MSN nick that i had displayed couple of weeks ago was true..." If you really want something, everything in the world will conspire in your favour to achieve it."  Whether you believe anything or everything in the preceding paragraphs..it's all up to you. =)
