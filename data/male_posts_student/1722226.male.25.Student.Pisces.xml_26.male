I await the carpet cleaners, after which it shall be farewell Parkway Plaza.  Well just farewell C building. I'm pretty sure I have a friend in B building.   She may disagree though.  I have been up for ages now, cleaning this blasted apartment. The oven was the worst of the lot. But I'm done now.   I still havent disconnected the modem or the router. I'll do that when the  cleaners arrive. My last few moments of broadband. Well at least until Thursday.  I'm tending to drift a bit as I type. I need to sleep.   Inders online right now and he's turned antiblog.   Anusha's online and sending sad smileys and sighing.  Achu's online and he's silent.  Inder just bought a new car. He seems a tad excited about it.
