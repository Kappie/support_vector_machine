I feel dirty, I feel cheap, and yeah, kind of like a sellout. I hate everything a blog stands for, and more importantly, I hate the fact that it's a trend that I just gave in to. Whatever, you can just fuck off if you don't want to be here, no skin off my balls. If you care, I'll try to update this bad boy daily, weekly, whatever. It's what I feel like doing at the time being, and let me tell you something, I'm not a very motivated person.  Should I tell you a bit about myself? Sure, why not. My name is Mike, I play drums in an Indianapolis-based punk rock band called The Sucks, formerly the Hooligans. I'm a cranky SOB, if you have not been able to tell already. I'll try to keep things on this blog...jesus I hate referring to it as that...somewhat interesting. It all depends on my mood, which I will completely let dictate what goes in this damned thing. However, I won't bore you to death with stupid shit like what I bought at the grocery store today or how my fiance dumped me (she didn't).
