She is a budding rose in the art of guitar-ism and musicianship; her songs are among my favorites right now in my experience with rock; she is one of the top five artists I listen to. Why in bloody heck has she not created a compact disc and distributed it. I personally would be buying one of the first copies.  It was quite odd tonight. So many damn people came that I knew  personally  that I frightened myself. There was the whole "group": dancer Elise, artisan Brock, photographer Laylee, computer queen Alanna (who I drove to get her camcorder thingie), filmer Katherine, programmer ZoÃ« (who is currently working on her laptop). Then there was a host of people I knew and did not know. Christie, Margaret, Robin, Katherine (Warren), Nick (who - would you believe it - was on my soccer team back when), Lauren, Aaron (Elise's brother) and Bethany (Elise's brother's "soul match"). And then there was Miles! From Bridge Builders! It was wickedly fun to see her again.  But Becca kicks buttocks. That's all that is to it. Of course, so many people were stuffed like sardines into Java around Becca that the room heated up with the millions of heat photons bouncing around. But hell! it was awesome.  The poem I posted of late did not recieve positive reviews. I shall have to re-analyze my style, for that one seemed a bit choppy. Naturally, some people were not to happy about the imagery in the last paragraph. I mean, who would be? It certainly ain't looking at a cracked glass half-full, now is it?  You are all humans (save those few gods that I have specified in earlier posts or never at all). Thus, you must acknowledge the supreme melodic dynamic that Goddess Becca holds with the potential of smiting or destruction.  Cheers, chaps.
