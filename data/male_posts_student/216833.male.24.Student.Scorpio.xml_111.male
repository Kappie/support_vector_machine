I have worked my ass off all week at school and work, had a little fun when I could and slept as little as possible. It was fun. The plans for the weekend are work even harder at school and rest.   I went to the store to buy mimi a present, I guess it's a "I miss you" present. I got my this awesome T-Shirt that says California on it. It's looks all old and shiz. It's just a shirt, who cares, right? I also went and got a haircut - I look super sexy now. At least I feel cleaner, makes for a nice evening with a bottle of wine and my awesome self.  I think I am going to finally do something with my new domian name. www.low-c.com is now going to be a new line of artist screen printed t-shirts made by hand by John Coffman. What do you think? I like making shirts and I think it would be cool to offer an alternative to mall wear. It will be totally Hosssome. I am going to get alex to help me set up some brand mess and come up with a logo. Look for the first shirts in the winter. I think I am going to try and learn flash and make this my first flash shoot. We'll see. I have to do something productive before I start school, and working on network equipment is not productive.  I love you all, even al and lacey.   current mood: artistic current music: pele
