I just sat outside, and fell asleep reading =)  it seems to always rain when i have soccer, like on thursday. Practice was alright, Ryan was there and we mainly worked on free kicks and corners.  Jeff drove us also, so now we don't have to wait for dad to talk and talk and talk...  When we got home, thats when the fun began...Mom wakes me up at midnight and apperently the alarms went off, and she got all paranoid -_-' wutever. But then we went to school today, and when it was over, the skys were so freakin dark, it looked kinda cool, but the staff made us go back inside, since they were scared of everything.    Yeah, so today is friday, and I have to clean my room today, because we are doing house cleaning all tommarow, and then i will be gone all sunday for a soccer game in midland. so comment if u want, because im leaving now.
