If you've noticed, I'd say at least 10 posts are all about programs and not about me. We're going to try and sum this in one  small  post instead of 3 long post like the last time. (A Big Leap- Part 2; Part 3)  Today I mowed my great-uncle's yard; again. Wow! you know what? I've just forgotten everything I was going to write about, so instead of try to find out what I was going to say, I'm just gonna leave. I'm to tired to think right now. Anyway, I'll see ya.
