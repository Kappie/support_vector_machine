His rambling is only cool on the screen.  Because my laptop has issues with graphics type stuff... like Photoshop causing it to blue screen, WinTV locks up from time to time. Maybe that's good? I won't be a total couch potato?  Anyway yesterday I went to office hours for a prof to figure out what I should do my paper on, and then went to a reception for some of my profs who recently released books. Lots of wine...  Then I went to a meeting for Traffic... it was alright.   I got to watch Smackdown last night... I couldn't help but chuckle when Angle asked the Big Show, "You eat crap for breakfast?"  ***
