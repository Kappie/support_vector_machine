It was quite light (too light to see most stars) so only the brightest stars were visible, but unfortunately, no comets :(  The view of Stafford at night was brilliant though, so the early morning trip wasn't all bad.  Aparantly the comets are going to be brighter and higher in the sky in May so maybe I'll spot it then!
