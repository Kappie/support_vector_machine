Do you mean to tell me that they couldn't even tell that the feline was just a little too small to be a panther?  I mean, sure, the cat was big, but to mistake it for a panther?  I'm glad we've got such smart folks like that in NATO to cover our backs.    They'll send out the police force to apprehend something that they *think* might be dangerous, but they won't send troops to apprehend someone they *know* is a brutal dictator.
