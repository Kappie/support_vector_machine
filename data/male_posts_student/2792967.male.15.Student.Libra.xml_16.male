I figure its time for a change. I just had a greatly refreshing shower. Washed the old me away. I also washed my hair. :P Anyway, I figure if I am to have any chance with Reegan I have to stop being a hermit. Im off to find a winamp alarm clock plugin so I can wake up nice and early. Post again tommorow.  **listening to Foreigner - Cold As Ice**   *jams on his guitar*
