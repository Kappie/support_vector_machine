Yup, I'm having one of those days again! I actually have them a lot. Anyways, I'm writing this because I am WAY ahead in my computers class, and there's only so much typing that you can do in a day, I mean come on! We are gonna be typing for 2 weeks straight, that's just not right! But enough about school crap, who cares? Well I kinda do, but that's besides the point. I still have to have Kenny (aka STOCK) sign my yearbook, so I think I'm gonna let him take it home with him, I just hope he doesn't forget it! Sometimes I'm not sure if everything "upstairs" is working for him. Just one more thing...for Kenny...I think I'll give you his infamous quote..."Huh? What...Huh?". It's all in good fun buddy... ;)
