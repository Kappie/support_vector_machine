Yong Sheng and me were begging Job to play Sexy Poker, as it was a fun game, not for any other reason. Then as i walked away, Jun Jie came over, and for no reason, grabbed Job's 16-year old brother. Poor thing.  Everyone had the same reaction. "Gay!" Job was the one who was shocked the most. Jun Jie has been renowned to look like Jamie Yeo, but we didnt think he would do a thing like that.  Next, the following event is rather minor. It happened during Chinese lesson. Kee was babbling and niaoing ppl as usual, and she stopped, looking at Jun Jie and Wei Xiong, she said in chinese, " You two, what are u guys doing? The two of you stop helping each other pluck your hand hair off. GAY ar?" She actually said that!  The final event was the most interesting of all, i was the one who spotted it.  It happened like this. We were reading a chinese article, when i heard water splashing onto the floor, as though someone was urinating. I turned around, looking for the source of the sound, and i saw a puddle of water under Jun Jie's table. Instinctively, i thought Jun Jie had some problem and could not hold back his urine.   Then i looked at his table, and i saw a sight that was very unique, practically the only time i would see this.    WATER WAS FLOWING LIKE A WATERFALL. The table was dripping water like mad. I saw that his waterbottle was on the table in the small ditch, and the ditch was overflowing with water. I quickly alerted Jun Jie and he stopped the leaking of water from his bottle.  Woah. what a sight. The ditch full of water, the floor with a puddle of water, and his worksheets were wet. God knows how he managed to miss the water filling up on his table.    Ending here... PS: I violently objected to Mr Hon's proposal of buying the Clock Model for 85 dollars. he has gone mad!
