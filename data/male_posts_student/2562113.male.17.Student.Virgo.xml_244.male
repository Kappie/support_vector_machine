Last last Friday (5/21) was fun! jena and i watched one of my favorite movies (vanilla sky) and then Darin had a few people over and his neighbor had a keg party.  I ended up throwing a small party in his kitchen and played bartender for a while . I couldn't drink at all bc i was on antibiotics but i still had a lot of fun. last last saturday i had a rave and andrew and xavier did some freaky cross dressing, save it for halloween! last sunday night reza jay colleen and i had some bong action and then munchie action. last monday we played basketball and ultimate frisbee at farley. we had the crackheads vs the potheads. i was on the pothead team!  we lost in basketball, but dominated in frisbee, the sport that really counts!  it was great because lightning was crashing all around us as we played until it started to pour, so we headed to taco bell. fun day. tuesday i woke up late. i did some autoCAD work for the porch and that night me and reza and jay smoked some lavender. it was very relaxing. wednesday, kate came over and we played a lot of resident evil 2. there was a part  where i knew  crows would pop through the window and when they did i jumped and screamed to add to the effect. kate was terrified, it was a lot of fun! thursday night was the award ceremony at the high school. i'm very proud of my friends who received a lot of scholarships. Friday was fucking crazy. We all ate dinner at the outback, then i purchased  my very own FUNNEL , then i pretty much had a keg party. i got really drunk for the first time since dan's party! even though it got hectic for me, i still had a fucking blast. someone spilled beer into my keybaord  >:o  No more parties for a long time. I'm tired of cleaning up and i can't even enjoy myself most of the time. but still, it was fun and thanks everyone for cooperating when i needed it and thanks  mostly everyone  for showing respect for the party thrower. last night was wierd? me and andrew hung out at lauren's house with the girls and we ended up smoking and eating salvia. it's a leaf from a flower. look it up online. i don't think it had any effect on me?  i miss albany a lot.  i miss getting piss drunk, hooking up with madd girls, and not having a care in the world. i still am unemployed, i've been really lazy with that lately. i'm getting my wisdom teeth extracted on tuesday.. i have a feeling that i'm NOT going to be prescribed vicatin. i haven't been living up to some personal goals that i set. i wanted to read some books, but the book i ordered 3 weeks ago never came and i don't think it's ever coming so looks like i have to visit the library. i still plan on teaching myself more calculus. why? because i am a math major and i need to stay on top with that. i've been working out at least twice a week, but that's less than what i used to in college. muscle deterioration, yes : (   that's all for now i'll blog soon about my upcoming dental surgery.. until next time..  drink and be merry .. leave the drama home !
