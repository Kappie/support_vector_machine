Its a proud day for India.Not because a foreign born person could not become the PM of India.But because the two top posts of the Country (PM  President) are being Occupied by Men of Great Repute,Honesty,Integrity.The President of my Country is a Ph.D Holder and a Scientist with a deep concern for Children  the poor. A man of unbelievable Simplicity and someone who has dedicated his life to Science.                     My Prime Minister is a Ph.D Holder too and an economist of international repute.The father of Indian economic liberlization and an eminent professor . A man who enjoys respect across party lines. That both of them are non-Hindus in a Supposed to be Hindu Nationalist Country is an event of sheer coincidence  a fact that hardly matters to Indians.                   This is the best news we can give to the world.We are a Country of Values  immense respect for Education.Education is our path to Super-powerdom and Salvation from misery.Look no yonder but at our PM  President as a testimony to it (Both being Doctrates)! Jai Hind !
