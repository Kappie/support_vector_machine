TV : *breast enhancement ad for post pregnancy mothers. pair of breasts shows on screen* Dad: *walks into the room* "Hey, there's this show about breasts and bras tonite rite?" Sis  I : *Are we his children?*  somebody tell me, how were we supposed to react to that?!?!??! and what kinda of reaction was he expecting from us?!?!?  Dad : *Leaves the room* Me  : "We have a problem." Sis : "I think he's bored."  seriously, how many guyz out there actually talk to their fathers abt ladies' undergarments let alone their worldly (would like to have used globular here, but it sounded weird) assets? i dunno abt the other guyz, but I certainly dont stand around wif my dad at a shopping centre going, "Look at those Pa. How do you think Ma's compare to those puppies?"  It's ridiculous~!!!
