I felt terrible during band camp today so I had to(got to?) go home about an hour into it. Matchett can't be too happy about that but he let it slide.  So I've been sitting at home watching cartoons and doing random stuff.  You know, I realized something today. No matter how many friends I have from camp, people here will still hate me. No matter what. It's funny how people can't accept that someone has changed. I mean, I acted(mainly) myself at the camp, more or less like I do here, but people still hate me. Sure, I have a handful of close friends, but no girl takes two looks at me like Kat, Mary, Lindsay, Sam, and Avi did at the camp.  Ignore that last statement.  Well whatever, today was too lame to write anything of importance. If you're so bored that you're actually reading this, read the post down from here, it's way better because it is filled with depressing sentiment about what I explained in this post.  Bye.
