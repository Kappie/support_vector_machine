She was really cute and into metal (which is always a plus).Oh yeah, next weekend I am going out with some girl who graduated from Benet two years after we all did....KatieNewberry (I think). Anyoneknow who she is?  With that I will leave you with a message that some random dude from Cuba sent me on friendster today: Message:  you know, your personality and characteristics seem so familiar. is that really you in the photo?cuz i know this guy that has ur same name and same kind of character as youbut in the mean time... i didn't know what to put after that.
