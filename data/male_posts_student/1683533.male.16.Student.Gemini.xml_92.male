Here is a summary of each of my new teachers for the new Semester:   Teets:  My dear lord, what an uptight, conservative, strict, predictable person.  This is gonna be a hard class.  I dropped down to Algebra hoping I would get a better teacher, I think I got a worse one.  The material is so easy, but she makes it very hard with homework formats and hw quizzes...hw quizzes?? christ...I think i will make it though... Overall Grade for teacher: D+ Required Grade to keep my ass: B- or higher Expected Grade: anywhere between a C to B…I hope I can pull off a B  Meloche: I always did good in science classes, this class should be easy.  Homework is laid back…only problem is required organization.  I think I can pull it off though.  Meloche seems like a nice guy.  He talks a lot though, and he sometimes starts screaming for no reason…like he talks extremely loud….I don’t think he notices it.… Overall Grade for Teacher: B+ Required Grade to save my ass: B- or higher Expected grade: B to an A, I do decent in science classes as I said before  Sheperd: Good atmospohere…I like the piñatas.  She seems sort of old. But she is full of energy, and she seems sorta linient on stuff…I do good in Spanish too Overall Grade For Teacher: B Required grade to save my ass: B- or higher Expected Grade: B or A  Eddy: Had her last semester, hard class, but I have a good time in her class. Overall Grade for Teacher: B+ Required grade to save my ass: C or higher Expected Grade: C or B  5th hour I have wind ensemble…easy…  Windle: Windle actually isn’t there…we have this substitute, but Kate tells me she is better than Windle.  She does seem better.  I have some kids I dislike in the class, and some I don’t mind…but she seems lenient on hw and such… Overall Grade for Techer: A- Required Grade to save my ass: B- or higher Expected Grade: B or A, I do good in English  Yea, I was pretty bored lol….  Kate was in a bad mood today :( It wasn’t my fault for all I know, but I still felt bad that she was feeling upset.  I went to Westbourne market and bought her a pink rose, and wrote a little message in it for her, and I went to her house and surprised her with it :).  She is feeling better to say the least :). Yay!  Oh I also bought some peanut M because her little sister was on the computer one time, and I really wanted to talk to Kate, so I told her I would get her any candy she wanted if she got off.  I called later after I left her with the rose and M and when she gave the M to her sister she said she was very excited and she said “I like him” lol…cute…oh yea, and Kate looked really cute in her pajama bottoms ;) lol I really did catch her by surprise when I came over…I know it’s past 9 which should be DKT, but she has soccer :( so she isn’t home…pooh…  No real plans this weekend except for doing something with Kate, I hope I can have some sort of band practice on one of the days…that would be fun….bye bye  “This is the first! (thing I remember) Now it’s the last! (thing left on my mind)” -Blink 182
