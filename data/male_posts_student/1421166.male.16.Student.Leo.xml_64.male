Suddenly, growing up just seems so exciting. Now, there are big decisions to make, and many stuff to take care of. It's no longer just about school work and computer games. It's about commitments, my future, people's future, and responsibility. It's no longer just me. For some reason, I'm starting to realise how one's life can change others. And I've gotta be more sensitive now.   Yesterday was a really special day for me. It reminded me very much that I'm growing up and that I've gotta take my life seriously now. It was my birthday. But I was really quiet. It was the first time I really actually celebrated with my friends. Not really used to being special. But I was thinking. Thinking about people and life.And how much things have changed since I turned 14, and now, before I knew it, I've spent 15 years in this world. But thanks anyway to those who made my day yesterday.   Today I had cross country. Never did enjoy it before. But this year, it was raining. So it was a totally different experience, and didn't regret the run that much. Then went to Macs for lunch and talked to some of my friends about the fate of the section. It's quite exciting. How things are gonna change with our leadership. But I should just stick to my job, and get my stocks all checked.   Really glad to be able to share my life with some people again. I've gone thru alot with people, and sometimes I'm glad I did. It somehow makes me feel that the reltionship is really special. Guess that's what it's all about, going thru together.
