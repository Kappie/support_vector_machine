Courtesy of Thomas-   Constantly Risking Absurdity By: Caitlin O'Keeffe  I declared, rather loudly, to one of the two black students in my environmental science class that he was not really black. I had no intention of upsetting him at all, for some strange reason, I almost thought that it would make him happy, or at least make the other things that I said, which I realize in retrospect were extremely racist, not hurt him as much. I understand completely that he is a young black man, but from the few classes that we've shared over the years, I formed the opinion that he acted white, not black. I can't say that I was particularly prejudice, because I formed my opinion, that he was not really black after some conversations and basic interaction with him. But I can say that I cam to the opinion through some rather distorted logic.  This boy didn't conduct himself in a loud, disruptive manner. He was one of the best students in this honors level class, and any other class that I had with him. He attended Boy's State and Governor's School, not even I got to do those things! He said "Hello" rather than the stereotypical "Yo" that I would have expected to hear from him. He always asked questions, never "ax-ing" them, and he celebrated birthdays, never once having a "birfday". His attire is always exemplary, never having pants hanging around his ankles or white tee's that are five sizes to big. To my knowledge, he's never sat in lunch with a big bucket of fried chicken and collard greens, licking his fingers after every bite. There are no suspensions on his records for fighting with his classmates or disrespecting his teachers. He's not one of those "baby daddies", fathering more children than he can support.  I quickly realized, after the words left my mouth, that I had offended him and the other black student that was in the class. Their jaws hit the floor, mine froze. I knew my friend Hannah, who was standing next to me, agreed with me but I was in this one on my own. I tried to justify myself by telling him that he simply didn't do the things other black people did, and he tried to explain to me that, that doesn't make him any less black. I didn't get it. I couldn't see past the fact that he simply acted white, at leas by my standards. We walked out of the class and went our separate ways. He didn't seem to hear me shouting apologies, or maybe he knew that I wasn't sure why I was apologizing. I kept on walking in a daze, Hannah beside me the whole time, talking with me really hearing her.  Trying to get to gym relatively on time, I got rather frustrated when I stumbled across a group of black students, who were making their presence known to everyone that was within earshot of them. Still being in shock from the incident that had just occurred I bit my tongue, rather than mumbling my usual obscenities, and walked on. To my horrible surprise, the next traffic jam I encountered in the hallway, after the bell had rung, was a group of white kids! People that I know and that I am friends with, not nameless faces. The fact that they were being loud shocked me even more. I never noticed that it wasn't just the usual black kids that were obnoxious in the halls but white kids, me included do it too.
