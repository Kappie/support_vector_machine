If you've stumbled upon this page somehow and not heard of Slappy...I shall take this opportunity to inform you.  Slappy is my bitch.  I own him.  He likes to make fun of people in politics because 99% of the time....they deserve it.  Slappy isn't saying that he should be president...but he is saying that he knows people who shouldn't be.  If Slappy absolutely had to pick a candidate for office...he would probably pick Ralph Nader, I don't know why so don't ask me.  I really like Slappy because he seems to be everything I want to be; made of binary data, limber as hell, and very good with the ladies.  I hope you get to go meet Slappy and if you want to email him, you can!  Drop a line to Slappy for new comic ideas or just to tell him hey at:  tbrenner@gmail.com  Slappy Loves and Cherishes you .   (yeah I stole that from [adult swim])...so what?
