Take a trip with me.  **FLASHBACK**  You just got to school, it's your first day.   You walk into class.  You're nervous because you don't know anyone. A few minutes pass and you walk farther into the room, clutching your mom or dads hand with all your might, after taking off your coat. All the other kids are laughing and playing, you're an outsider. Your parents send you off to play with the other kids while they talk to your teacher. You nervously aproach sum of the other kids, who are playing with a farm puzzle.*RUSTY!!!!* They ask if you want to play with them, you shyly nod your head. Everything's ok...  There's the killer.  Everything's ok.  Why can't everything just be ok???  **Lets fast-forward a little more**  It's your third grade. You have friends now, good friends.  Friends that you've promised to be frfiends forever with, even to college and past marriage. Marriage. Who would think of marriage?!?!?!  Girls have cooties and boys are stupid. You go outside for recess and laugh and play with your friends. After recess you come inside and have milk and cookies. You feel a little tired so you put your head down and you take a quick snooze. Life is good...  Doesn't that sound nice?  You're awoken by a slap to the face. You fell asleep in American Lit. again. The kid in front of you turns around and smacks you on the back and says "Good job, Dumbass." Life's a bitch now. Your girlfriend/boyfrfiend is cheating on you, you're failing your classes, and you just drooled all over your notes. dang...  **Flashback ends**  wasn't that fun???  Thought so...  I wish life was easier. Over and Out!  Spense
