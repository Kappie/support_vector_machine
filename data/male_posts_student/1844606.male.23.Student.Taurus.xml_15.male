What I do to offset this problem is that I put a little bit of myself into every character, that way I don't identify fully with anyone in particular.  What I really want to do with this story is slam the shit out of all the kids in the class.  It could be so good.  Premise of the story is the narrator is a creative writing teacher and then I subtley dig at all the types of writing I hate.  Such as:  -using stories as a form of therapy.  There are people working hard for degrees in Psychology.  Go pay these people because I, as an Eng. and Rhet. Major, am not being compensated for listening to your trivial little problems about when your favorite pony died when you were a small child. -I'll admit I'm guilty of this one.  I have written, to my count, at least two full stories about relationships I've been in.  The difference/justification is this: I had not been seeing/interested in the person for a max. of 6 months.  This allows perspective, and also lets me write a  story  as apposed to a blow by blow account of he said she said, which let me tell you, can drag on and on.   -People who write about themselves and then  don't   change the name of the protagonist.  Seriously people, if you're going to make me spend time reading and critiquing something, at least make the effort to put a different frickin name down on the page.  My other problem with this inability to not name characters is that it completely ruins the whole "author is not narrator" idea that has been ingrained in my brain since I entered college.  It lessons the impact of the story and ultimately makes it come off as juvinial.  If that's what you want, keep it in your journal.  -Don't rant (this is my PoMo ironical point) -Don't write about art, or something related to aesthetic pleasure.  You come off sounding pretentious and if I wanted to look at a painting, I would.  I don't want to read about still lifes. -I'm guilty of this one hard core.  Don't referrence music just because it has sentimental value to you as the author.  It will not have the same impact on you as it does for the reader, thus the author looses control over what he/she is writing. -if you have a crush on someone in the class, tell them, don't write a subtle story about it Shakespeare. -Along the same lines, don't use the stories as a way to pick up women by acting emo.  (I'm kind of guilty of this).  Cause I really want to write my seminal piece "misogyny rules"  and then do a completely scathing piece on women and their inconsistances.  My second book would be "Male Assholes."  Think of it as a compainon piece. -Don't write shit, seems simple, but I'm sick of it -If you're gonna be super critical, you better be able to back it up, cause there ain't nothing worse than someone thinking they are God's greatest gift and then they constantly turn in subpar work.  Phew, I think my treatise is just about wrapped up.
