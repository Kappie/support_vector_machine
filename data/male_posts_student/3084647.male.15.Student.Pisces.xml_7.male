However, in the white there were a few patches of brown and black – the result of the Griffindoors’ Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson.    “He could have just done the lesson in a classroom and given us cushions,” Matt complained.    “Well, grass is healthy, isn’t it,” Minyu said dryly.    “And besides, you look very clean,” Barnabas said suspiciously.    “Oh, it’s very simple really.  Scourgify !” he said, pointing his wand at Barnabas. White foam and bubbles immediately started frothing – out of Barnabas’ mouth.    Matt clapped his hand over his mouth. “Oh NO, er, sorry, bad aiming, er,  Scourgify !” he said once again, and this time the spell worked. The muddy patches simply faded away. Barnabas stopped frothing at the mouth and instead started to strangle Matt.    Cheryl giggled. Just at that moment she bumped into a girl going in the opposite direction, who turned round and glared at her.    “Watch where you’re going,  Miss ,” the girl said snidely. The girl next to her, rather pretty but with a vacant expression on her face, nodded, trying to sneer. Cheryl stared back, but Eunice pulled her away.    “Ignore her,” Muthu said calmly.    “Who’s she?”    “Her name is Yee Tien – and the girl beside her – she’s called Liqin,” Eunice replied vaguely. Her eyes seemed trained on the teachers’ table.    “They’re from Slithering, aren’t they?” Cheryl asked, knowing this was a rather rhetorical question. All Slitherings were rude and bore smirks on their faces. Most, at least. The others might be considered as bimbos.    They sat down, eagerly awaiting their dinner. As they waited, Cheryl happened to look up at the Staff table, where she saw Professor Molekiw apparently deep in conversation with Professor Siva, who had a rather blank expression on his face. The glasses in front of them held horribly red wine. Cheryl shuddered. She did not like the look that was on Kiw’s face now – a mix of triumph and malice.    “Eh, Cheryl! Food’s here,” Cheryl heard Muthu from a seemingly far way off. She shook her head and glanced at the food. There were large platters of sushi and rice and fries – the school was trying hard to have a varied menu. Cheryl shook her head again.    “I’m on a diet,” she said.  ----------  As Matt was returning to his common room from the washroom after dinner, he could not help but hear whispers coming from the classroom next to him. Quietly, he stopped outside the door.    “Well... what are we going to do about,  you know ,” a hushed voice said in panic. The voice had an unmistakable lilt to it – Professor Huda’s.    “I don’t know. It was your fault in the first place! All the fooling around,” a male voice said. This one was once again unmistakable – Professor Helmi’s.    Matt’s eyes widened in horror, but he pressed his ear to the door and continued listening.    “It was your fault! You got me all excited,” Professor Huda replied. “Come on, I can’t hide it forever. It’s already the seventh month! It  has  to come out soon!”    Matt had heard enough. He ran.   ----------  As Cheryl neared the staffroom, she could hear raised voices, obviously arguing.    “Well, Smurf, it’s all very regrettable, and I don’t know what possessed me when I signed the document – but there it is! It’s a legally binding contract!” this voice was all too familiar...   “It is an excuse for Ministry-sanctioned surveillance,” the voice of the Headmaster replied coolly. “I am sure you know, Percival, that I do not allow that in my school.”    “Minellus asked me whether he could be Discipline Master at Hogwarts, knowing you would never allow that – and I allowed him to. I don’t know why I did, but I’m glad I did! Such discipline standards in a hallowed institution simply cannot be allowed. I hear all these rumours about students vandalising school property, graffiti on walls, even  teachers  acting lovey-dovey in front of students –“    “And that is all they are – rumours. Are you so weak as to believe them, Percival?” And then in a much gentler tone, the Headmaster continued. “He is terrorizing the school. Please, cancel the contract.”    Cheryl stopped at the door and pressed her ear to it. If she was not wrong, Minellus Molekiw had somehow become Discipline Master at Hogwarts by the order of the Minister, who didn’t know why he had allowed Molekiw to become Discipline Master in the first place. And now the Headmaster was asking the Minister to cancel Molekiw’s contract as Discipline Master. It didn’t fit in.    “Ah... Minister,” it was another voice, the fruity tone of Minellus Molekiw.    “Please inform me of your decision when you are done, Percival,” the Headmaster said curtly. Cheryl heard the swish of robes and the distant sound of a door closing. Kiw and the Minister were alone now.    “Minellus... these reports that the Headmaster has given me... you seem to be abusing your authority here,” the Minister said rather uncertainly. “I think...I will have to order you to leave Hogwarts,” he finished lamely.    “But you signed the contract, Minister,” Molekiw replied coldly. “I am not under your jurisdiction now. It says so here: ‘Once this contract is signed by the Minister for Magic, the Discipline Master will no longer be underany jurisdiction, and will be the highest authority in the school.’”    “But... but... I’m the Minister!”    “You know, Minister,” the voice of Molekiw said, and Cheryl could almost imagine his lip curling, “I know some things about you. Like how you cannot perform even a simple Levitation Charm...”    The Minister sputtered in anger.    “I’m sure if I released that fact to the press they’d have a field day...”    “Are... are you blackmailing me?” the Minister said weakly. There was fear in his voice.    Silence. Then – “I’m afraid I am, Minister. I trust I will not be removed from this post. A good evening to you,” Molekiw said smoothly.    Just then Cheryl heard it – ten rings. Ten o’ clock. Any student caught outside of their common room after this time would have to do a detention with Kiw. Reluctantly, Cheryl tore herself away from the door and sprinted back to the Griffindoor common room.  ----------  “I just heard,” Cheryl gasped out as she practically jumped through the portrait hole to get into the common room, “Kiw talking to the Minister.”    Her friends stared at her. “What?” Muthu said, nonplussed.    Cheryl proceeded to act out the conversation she had just heard.    “Wait a minute..."Hu Ping said slowly. “You’re saying Kiw somehow deceived the Minister to make him Discipline Master here, but the Minister doesn’t know why he did it? How odd.”    Cheryl nodded fervently.    “And also that now Kiw is blackmailing the Minister so he can keep his job here?”    Cheryl nodded again.    Silence.    And then the torrent.    “What an idiot!”    “Stupid Minister! Couldn’t he have just fired Kiw?!”   "Kiw is such a cunning asshole!”    “Hey, people! Hey! HEY!” Matt roared. Apparently he too had just come into the common room, judging from his flushed cheeks and messy hair.    “Huda and Helmi...” and here he lowered his voice to a dramatic whisper, “are having a baby!”
