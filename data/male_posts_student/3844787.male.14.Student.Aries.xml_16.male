Its been wicked, Saturday morning I went too work and concreted a load of floor, then made it level. This took about 2 hours, and I got paid Â£10, so i'm happy!  When me and my Dad got home. we went too Redditch with my mum, we walked around, I got some guitar strings, and we went for a meal. After this, we walked around a bit more, had a fuck off ice cream and left. On the way home, my mum started too whisper too my dad, and we went too my aunt and uncles! After there, me and my bro got in the car, and m ymum and dad drove all the way back too the shopping centre, and me and my bro waited in the car for ages and ages, and then the elevator opened, and my dad was there with a guitar. My parents bought me a brand new electro-acoustic guitar, and a hard case, so I was stoked.  The next day, I woke up we went too stratford and picked up my mate, (he's in bed at the moment) and then  me and my  mate skated around Safeway for a bit, then we went in, I brought 2 DVD racks, and some sandwiches, then we met up with my parents and left.  Thats about it really, and today i'm going too Redditch. Peace Out :)
