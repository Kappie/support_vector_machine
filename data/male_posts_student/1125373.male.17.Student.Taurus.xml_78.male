I thought I was going to go MAD. Crazy ladies EVERYWHERE. sheesh. I nearly got this one purse thats like made out of this plastic like material. my mom didnt like it though. I got this really cool belt, its clear.   Moving on...  So I watch launch.yahoo.com for like hours on end, and I just let the player keep going and this one random video pops up entitled "Penny  Me" so i start watching and i was like "Dannnng these guys are hot." I look at the Artist name, and lo and behold, the return of Hanson. Seriously, they are hot.  proof: hotkansaschik777: yeah trhey got hotter man ambabe girl247: they actually look like boys now! hotkansaschik777: yeah they got haircuts hotkansaschik777: and hit puberty  I know what you're thinking....those guys from like 8 years ago, arent hot. Yeah, 8 years ago they were young, looked like girls, and their music made me sick. But now they are older, actually look like guys, and meh their music aint that great but anything is better than Brittany Spears.    Only a week until prom. YAY! The coolest guy ever is my date and its gunna be so much fun.   I am officially addicted to pudding and jello from my wisdom teeth getting removed. Im still a lil green from bruising.  List of people that called me a name that refered to my Swelling: Brandon Kevin Myself JuFu   if i left you off let me know    allright kids off for now...   rock on
