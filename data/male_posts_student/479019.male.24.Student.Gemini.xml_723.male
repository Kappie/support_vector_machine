I've come to the conclusion that despite my laptop having excellent sound for a laptop, I want a computer with quality speakers and a good sound card next time. My mp3s on this computer sound excellent.  Should I get a tv tuner or a new mp3 cd player for myself? I'm so materialistic.  I'm amused by how anime Teen Titans is. Robin anime-style is amusing.   Courage the Cowardly Dog is so not a cartoon for little kids. That's one trippy ass cartoon.  Maybe I'll watch some netflix movies today.  **
