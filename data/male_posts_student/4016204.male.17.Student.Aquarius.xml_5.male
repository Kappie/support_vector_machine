After Shayna stabbed all the bees with a metal rod, I asked her if she was allergic to bee stings. (Shayna is allergic to everything. I really mean everything.) She said she was allergic to bee stings. Crazy.  Afterwards, when our youth pastor, Pastor Bill came out and found out he was like, "Boyz...."  It was mostly Shayna though.  I now have 11 days till I leave for college. It will be fun. If you are a friend of mine who stops by, please try to leave a comment. I want to know if you have been here or are just lying to make me feel better.
