If you would be so kind as to try to connect to 65.168.150.128:14567 with Battlefield 1942 and drop me a note in comments if it works, I would appreciate it. If this works, I'm going to store it out in the garage or something and just let it sit there and run. It takes about 3 minutes to load a map, but it was completely free so I'm happy with it.  Also today, I held a surprise LAN party. When I found out  urlLink Wingman  had the day off and  urlLink Mr. Nice Guy  could make it to my house, I figured there wasn't any way I  couldn't  have a LAN. We messed around for a while, and then finally got the oil-truck/technical collision scene right. After three LAN parties and I don't know how many tries, we've finally got it done. Woo.  As for tomorrow? I'm not sure what I'll be doing, but I'll probably go in to work for a little bit to help get caught up. I'll probably have lunch at the new restaurant as well. Hopefully, I'll be able to get all the bugs worked out of this server and get things going. I'm off to bed, don't stay up too late now.
