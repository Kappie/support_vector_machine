My mom has been reading these journals and commenting and at first it was annoying because she was trying to be sneaky about it, but now I don't mind cause she's going to look at it wether she comments or not. So I've decided to wait for Anisia to figure out if she thinks we had something more than just a crush and if that is, then if she wants to give us another try. I know it's not supposed to end so quick and in such confusion. It doesn't end that way when you feel this way about the other person, it ends with you knowing that it was worth it and that the other person truly cared about you and so far I still have doubts and that's why I need another chance with her, that way I'll know for sure if she.......... truly loves me.  Love you all Bye
