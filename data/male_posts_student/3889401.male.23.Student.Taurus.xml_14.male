He is the biggest flirt I have seen and thank god, we escaped from the scene.   Girl: You ass**** !! What do you think you are doing? What do you think...  Jeet: I think you are amazingly beautiful.  Girl: Excuse Me !!!  Jeet: I think I was thinking about you and I hit you.  Girl: (Somewhat, soothing ..) You was about to hit me. You learning?  Jeet: (Smilingly) Yeah !!!  Girl: Drive safe, man !!!  Jeet: Yeah, I will.  Girl: OK. Bye and have a nice day.  Jeet: (Still smiling.) I have some other plan.  And we get into the car.
