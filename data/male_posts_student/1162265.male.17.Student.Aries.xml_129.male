I can't get over the fact it seems to have originated in Central Africa in supposedly the 50's, despite the fact it was agreed upon as originating in the 70's for much longer.  Next thing that bothers me, if it originated in Central Africa then why is it so prevelant among African-Americans? By the same logic it should be a huge problem with British blacks, and Brazilian blacks because they come into quite a bit of contact with Native Africans as well.  Then we have the gay community being big on AIDS, that makes ABSOLUTELY no sense at all, why them? Aren't their other tight knight communities that have sex?   So I've come to one of two conclusions.  The first, being the most likely.  We have a disease that came about after the destruction of smallpox, although that is now being denied.  Why is it being denied now? Could it be possible, since most humans on the planet were vaccinated, that a disease could have been planted in the Small Pox Vaccine? That could explain why it's prevelant in not only Central Africa (and with Modernization, such as the multi-national highways, and roadside prostitutes, couldn't a disease becoming wide spread in the Southern become a logical conclusion?) but also with the Gay community.  Many of our parents were given the Small Pox vaccine.  How easy would it have been to slip a disease in that way.  Even more, with the advances in medicine at the time, isn't it easy to imagine AIDS being an intentional mutation of a far older African disease? People suspect it's been around for a long while, but the older cases could be a different (and likely isolated strain) of primative AIDS.  If it was mixed with another disease, wouldn't this change it's genetic material, and as such how it worked?  So many holes in the story.... For example, wouldn't it have spread to China?  Why isn't it devastating India?  It can't be marriage traditions, because cities of millions old ways die quickly.  So what could it be?
