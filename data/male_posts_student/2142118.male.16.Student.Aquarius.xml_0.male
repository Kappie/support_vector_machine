Jesus was willing to sacrifice Himself so that we might live... so how much am i willing to give?  could i give up what i want?  so... it remains to be seen.  the struggle is within me... could i devote my entire life to Him with no holds barred?  or will my desire for earthly things win out?  many times, it is not so much a struggle with supernatural evil as it is a struggle with our human nature.  selfishness.  laziness.  weakness.  rule me, oh God... take away my selfishness and laziness.  make me complete in my weakness.  God...
