So ner :P  I'll post a photo of myself (instead of that bear lol) so that you can all see how minging I am... well I might, I'm scared of paedo's... Well who isn't? It's just that I'm 16, that's all, so at this age I am gonna be scared. I'd probably scared as an adult as well, 'coz if I had kids, I'd be scared of them... Now I'm just rambling.  Well you will soon know if I decide to or not.  Oh yea, I think it's time I told you about UKIT. UKIT is, a traning institute that I go to. If you read my post 'Home sweet home!', in the 6th paragraph, you will see what qualification I am studying for. Well, UKIT is the name of the traning institute that I go to. I am currently doing a basic course in IT though. They made me do it, I have to study Microsoft Office and other basic things before I start the actual web designer course. Still, it's pretty easy though, I'll wizz through it (geek lol).  Well, I have to study now, so I'll add more later when I get home... If I can get my sister off... hmph :(
