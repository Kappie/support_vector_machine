Yes i know that some of you are now thinking "EWWWW HE"S A DIRTY GARBAGE PICKER!!!" but atleast i have pride in my work and i'm doing something construtive and helpful, it could be worse, i could be a person that packs the boxes at a fudge factory.  But i have had many adventures as a janitor, well not really adventures but thing that i like to bitch about anyway. For instance, the other day as i was sweeping minding my own business when i was overwhelmed by a stench that resembled rancid tuna mixed with year old used kitty litter. it was so horrible my eyes started to water...well my co-worker and me tracked down the accused locker and attempted to open it with what was apperently the combination, 10 minutes later with us no closer to opening the locker and me getting increasingly fed up with the stench, out come the bolt cutters! these aren't any run of the mill bolt cutters, they're some mother ass bolt cutters, they can cut through 2 inches of steel in less then a second(actually i don't know this, but i like to assume). well needless to say Mr. piss ass combination lock didn't stand a chance.  it was as i opened the locker that i realised the stupidity of my haste, it's surprising how much smell a locker door can keep in. After the initial shock of the stench multiplying tenfold and also after the gagging had ceased and my vision cleared up i peered into the locker and was greeted with a stack of lunches that dated back from the beginning of the year (september).  I was tempted at this point to poke at them with a stick but i was affraid that they'd be prevoked into attacking. so on it was with the gloves and i did the best i could to cover my nose, it wouldn't have been so bad if one of the bags hadn't started dripping some strangly colored liquid (actually it was kinda brownish but i wanted to tone it down a bit). Long story short after many close calls with bringing back that days lunch, we eventually got everything out of the locker. At this point the whole hall way rank of rancid tuna and old kitty litter. but it was another job well done for JANITOR MAN!!!! (cool sounding music) -Matt
