Class starts at 8.  It's a good thing I live so close.  I managed to get ready in about 3 minutes and was only late a minute or two.  Wow, good job me.  I think that's a record.  The only downside I guess was my hair was sticking out a bit on my right side.  No one would notice though.  That sort of thing no one would come out and say.  Anyways.  Gym was boring.  We didn't do anything except get lockers.  I tried my combo a few times and just gave up.  I know I got the numbers right but they're the new lockers and they click and I don't know.  I'll figure it out Thursday, I guess.  I didn't care to figure it out because I was in a 'I don't care' mood.  So that was over then I headed on to Biology.  Biology was alright.  We checked homework from the previous night.  It was super easy.  So that was checked and then we did some notes.  I always get bored when we have notes.  That's the time when I usualy fall asleep.  I was thinking last night that I could get some caffeine before to wake myself up.  I guess that's something I could try.  Then on to 3rd, computer programming.  We're working on some Java stuff.  Not too hard, but it's all out of this online book that's hard to follow.  It's pretty boring right now.  Mr. Beall is having to teach us and the AP students.  So we get lost and go through 20 minutes of debugging our first program.  Woo, yay!  Not too bad I guess... better than some other boring class.  Then on to World History.  We got our books today.  1st term I remember getting fined for the edges of my book being bent when I turned it in.  $5 for that dang thing.  That's the sort of thing you pay for at the end of the year, but no O'dell had to charge me for some stupid bent edges that happens so easily when you have 2 or 3 books in your bag at a time along with 5 binders pressing up on them to the lining of your bag.  I'm not sure why this is such a big deal, but it just ticked me off.  I was sure to write on the book that I got it with bent edges.  So yeah.  I even told the people around me to be my witnesses if he decided to charge me $5 again for it.  So yeah, I'm taking it to court if he does.  Yeah, then off to lunch.  I must say I like the new lunch periods.  They're much easier, I have to say.  A lot quicker to get food and you don't have to fight to get a seat (at least at the table I used to sit at).  Now I guess it doesn't matter because all the tables are in a big line.  Yeah, then Chris Tolley (Freshman) comes and sits by me.  He sat by me on Monday as well.  This kid bugs me.  He used to be in the same after school program with me back in 8th grade at Harding.  The kind just bugs me.  He's at least 14 years old (I think) and he acts like he's about 6.  Thinking first about his feelings, I've always been as nice to him as I possibly could.  The only problem I have with him is that he wines one minute about something (almost crying) and then the next minute hes swearing and acting like he's some badass bully.  Almost like that mental kid that raps Eminem.  The thing about Tolley is that he seems to think he can come to me for simpathy.  I have no problem, I guess, but it's just annoying.  I wish I could just tell this kid to grow up!  So blah!  Yeah after lunch, went back to World History.  Boring, and we get a worksheet with like 40 problems on it due Friday.  Tight.  I'll be doing that Thursday night, thank you very much.  On to LA 10.  Watched a movie.  Wasn't too bad.  Yeah blah.  Couple people sitting by me got yelled at for talking too much.  After someone gets yelled at by Mrs. Frye, there's always an awkward silence where no one moves and then she just goes on talking like her normal joyful self and then it's all weird.  Then on to Geometry.  I'm glad I don't have Bradley.  She has to know by now that I don't have her this term.  I didn't bother to tell her after taking my final.  I guess I just left her to assume I didn't switch.  Too freaking bad.  Fitz is alright.  She's a lot nicer than Bradley, let us say that for sure.  So far it isn't too bad.  The only real problem is that Jory sits right next to me.  The kid makes me laugh about every 2 minutes.  The other day he was making a noise so I look over by his desk to see him drooling with his mouth wide open all over his desk.  Wow.  Good job.  The kid cracks me up... in a sick way.  I hope he just stops being funny for once so I can concentrate?  So yeah.  Walked home and that was it.  Later on I went back to the school and shot around.  I'll be playing in an AAU team with some guys from the Kennedy team soon.  So a few of them were there and we played some games.  Was fun.  Dunked it a few times (not during the games) w00t!  On one play though I jammed my finger pretty bad and it's swolen right now.  So that sucks.  That was my whole day.  Hope you enjoyed my pointless rant about book edges, and my swolen finger.  I hope tomorrow is better.  Don't have a first hour.  Tight.  So good night.
