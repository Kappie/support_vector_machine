I've known my best friend since 5th grade, except...we haven't been best friends all along. Really, we haven't been really great friends until about a year ago. So see? Sometimes it takes time to get to know a person. If someone asked me what makes a best friend, I'd have to introduce you to my best friend Carly. :) There's a million qualities you can list, but there's just something about Carly that I can't quite define. Sure, she's like everybody elses best friend  you can tell her anything, she keeps secrets, and she helps you through hard times. But that's not all there is to her. She's not there just through the good or bad, she's there all the time. :) (Like that makes sense, but...you know :P) If you're with Carly, you're guaranteed to have fun. Nobody's left out and you're not judged. We've got the bestest inside jokes in the world and no one knows that the hell we're talking about. Everytime we're together, we laugh  have the greatest time ever. We have other awesome friends too. It's so crazy how we're all so much alike..and yet, we're so different from a lot of other people. Carly's the sweetest ever...and just knowing she's there  care's about me is enough...and I have more than that..so I'm the most grateful happy guy there is. :) I've got the greatest best friend ever, I've got some other kick-ass awesome friends...and a billion other things that are going for me right now. I couldn't be happier and I wouldn't trade any of these moments for jack. And I know Carly loves me :D...not just cuz she says she does, cuz I know she does. She's the best. Just knowing Carly makes me want to be a better person. :) She's always going for what she wants  tries her best to get it  succeed. She's smart, beautiful, and my best friend. Plus, there's a billion other things about her, that make her who she is...:D Peace, Love  All Good Things ~ SiLaS
