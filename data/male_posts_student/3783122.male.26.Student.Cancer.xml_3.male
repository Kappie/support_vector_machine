I have known Josh now for about 3 years. Ryan I have known for just about a year. He and I are planning another bike campout here next month with plans on going to Devels Lake. Huge area to bike in Wisconsin. I will take photos this time.   Other news, well I have made a plan that I am no longer going to pay rent and not own something. It's been a very small dream of mine to live on a sail boat. Every now and again the idea rears it's head up and reminds me of how nice it would be. Ryan's family has a 25' Morgan they want to sell for 3G and that is a great pice concidering it's worth 8G. At the moment it's in limbo. See Ryan does not know if his father sold it yet. I expressed intrest here not to long ago and I dont think Mr. Kyner thinks I was serious. So we are just going to have to wate and see whats going on. I said that I would even concider 1G more to out sell the guy. I called him today and hopefuly there will be something in my favor. There is a lot of things that I have to cincider about living on the boat and I will get more in to that the next time I blog. Things like there is no shower and no washer and dryer (that is the easy one) And what to do about winter and all that. Well, I am off till next blog.
