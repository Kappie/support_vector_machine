Me: oh erm, Joy Division Student: Oh I've never heard of them, are they old or new? Me: Old  She carries on with small talk for a while  Student: Anyway, do you know what stress is? Me:  *the evil part of my brain was telling me to tell her to naff off - I'm that evil*  Yes Student: Well we're doing yoga classes for students Me: Well I don't really get stressed that often so no, not for me Student: Yes, you look pretty chilled out, well how about a donation? Me: Sorry I've no money on me Anyway, I've tried 3 places for work, nothing so far, I'll try two more tomorrow then I will give up - yay!
