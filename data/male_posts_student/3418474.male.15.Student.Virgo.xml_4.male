I'm feeling great about the friends situation...God will provide all I have to do is trust in him.  TOday I worked down at my dad's job site and that was kinda wearing on me cuz i went to bed at one and I think I woke up at 6 this morning cuz my dad woke me up to get me to work:S and I didn't even know I was gonna work:S. Then I came home and put up lawn furniture and skateboarded:P...haha weird eh I think I might start skateboarding again.  :P Haha that was my day and most people already probably heard an exact replica:P.   It's soo hot out it's amazing:) I wanna get myself a wicked tan.  I'm taking off to Cali tomorrow to ride the waves:P...haha I wish naahh I'm goin to Saskatchewan to ride the tractors hahaha:P bad comparison.  But yea hopefully I have fun down there or over there.  Grrr :@ k well I'm absolutely done with living even the tinyest bit away from my Jesus.  I'm gonna go for it all and get as close as I can.  I've given alot of thought to the things I've said on this blog and I've decided that I should fulfill em.  I know the right way and since i do I'll be judged accordingly by God on the day when I die.  I want to have a wicked crown when I get to heaven haha maybe not wicked cuz wicked is from hell:P just awesome and yea man I wanna get myself treasures in heaven.  I wanna live this thing for God:).  Man I'd kill to here the words " well done my good and faithful servant":) that'd be soo soo amazing.  This has been long soo far but keep reading:P...  God has my life in his hands now...I'm given myself to him. I wanna live by the spirit and bye what he wants.  God kicks Satan butt. The chorus of one thing by Finger 11 is killer to describe what I feel:  If I traded it all If I gave it all away for one thing Just for one thing If I sorted it out If I knew all about this one thing Wouldnâ€™t that be something  Like Man i wanna trade it all away for one thing...It's tough tho  I'm sick of my living tho soo it's my only option and I know it's the right one cuz I feel the holy spirit telling me to give myself away to God and trust him.  Alright guys that's a lil peek into my life I know it's long but comments are great:) I hate joke comments:P...Unless u can really make me smirk then I'm fine:)  GOD BLESS YOU ALL and to all a goodnight:P  Oh yea...guys if ur up for the bible study tell me...I wanna arrange a couple meetings this summer for it(y) Adios
