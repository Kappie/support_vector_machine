Well… I have just been really busy lately… I think I mentioned I’m back at football now, and that means I’m not left with a lot of free time, with training and games taking up three days of the week. But, its fun, so I think I’ll stick to it... and I think my fitness is gradually improving... [Not that you can improve much on perfection :D ]   And, there is also the matter of school holidays… which, to most normal people would probably mean much more time for blogging…  Well… I’m not normal...  And there’s also the matter of my little brother being home all the time… and I mean all the time… if you thought I don’t get out much, you obviously don’t know Lewis. He has literally sat non-stop in front of the computer playing crappy game boy games continually from the moment he wakes up till he goes to bed.   This isn’t too much of a problem though, as it keeps him quiet and out of my face, and the only way that it affects me is that I am blogging a whole lot less, and not spending any time on the computer. This is prolly good for me anyway.   Although I wouldn’t mind it if my computer illiterate family could quit meddling with things they don’t understand… which, for my brother, is basically everything aside from notepad, and even that point is arguable.   He manages to make the computer unusable after only half an hour normally, so you can imagine the state that it is in after he has been tinkering away for almost a week straight.  Nothing works.   That explains why I am currently typing this blog in Microsoft word, for fear of the entire computer exploding in my face.   This also explains why my capital letters and punctuation are so well placed.   By the way, Kilsyth football club sucks ass… ahahaha… ten goal victory!! It felt mighty good belting out the song at the end of the game, knowing those stuck up bastards were in the rooms next door to us... they were so shattered… ahahhaa  And with that, I’ll leave you with my final note:    WWWWEEEEE’REEEEEE a happy team at Blackburn,  We’re the mighty fighting burns, We love our club and we play to win, Riding the bumps with a grin, at Blackburn Come what may you’ll find us striving,  Teamwork is the thing that counts, OI OI All for one and one for all,  Is the way we play at Blackburn, We are the mighty fighting burns!!
