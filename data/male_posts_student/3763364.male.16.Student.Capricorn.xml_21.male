I don't really know what it is, but I feel almost kinda sorta maybe a little bit better. Like some weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. I suppose it  is  better not keeping everything inside.     You know what I found out? I hug is scientifically proven to make you feel better. When your boyfriend or girlfriend hugs you, the resulting emotions (yes, I hear it's that warm, fuzzy feeling inside) trigger the release of endorphins, which are your body's natural painkilllers. Now, this tried and true technique not only works to help emotional pain, but physical as well! Yay....     When I was born, I was 8 pounds, 7 ounces. The correlation of those two numbers seems to follow me everywhere I go. The first girl to ever break my heart, her email is  urlLink ****87@hotmail.com , and the love of my life, her email is  urlLink ******78@hotmail.com . Creey coincidence, yah?  Oh, oh, speaking of coincidences/proof of my premonition, here's a neat little story:  Ok, so me and two friends are walking down the alley after returning from (what we thought wsas) the improv competition.  Out of the corner of my eye, I spot friend #2's mom driving by in her car, and I say, almost out of nowhere and without thinking (perhaps not even me talking at all), "I wonder why she's going to get Sheri at this hour." Both friends look at me in sheer perplexion.   Then, as we are walking down the alley, we see friend #2's brother, Robbie, and he says to us "Hey, have you guys seen Sheri? She ran away." We put the complex puzzle together to find out that her mom was out searching for her.  Now both friends were quite scared. The look they were giving me said it all. We continued to walk farther down the allay, and I said, "Don't worry, we'll find her in a trash can sooner or later." Sure enough, not 10 seconds afterwards, little Sheri pops up out of a trashcan a few feet away from us.  On a scale of one to ten, the creeped-the-fuck-out factor was around 11.   You know, there's a one hundred and fifty dollar cheque that's been sitting on my desk for the last few days. I'm not even in that big of a hurry to spend the money, let alone cash it. You know, the same applies to my drivers liscence. I don't even have my learner's permit yet. I figure I'll just take the bus to and from university every day anyways.  Am I more apathetic than I think? Oh God, lets hope not.....
