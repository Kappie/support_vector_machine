Everything is in and I'll be getting paperwork in a couple of weeks. I also managed to go for a little run this morning as well. 2 days in a row of jogging! Can I keep it up? It's been years since I last ran that little trail. The last time was my senior year of high school. I've ran since then, but usually on an indoor track or on a treadmill... I think that's why my knees are feeling it more now. I'm not used to the punishment of running on the road anymore.  My plans for the rest of today are to call the UCI Registrar, go to the bank, and then go to work. I should try to get some painting done tonight too. Hmm... should I have a slurpee today?  ***
