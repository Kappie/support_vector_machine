Then went to 'the park' and looked at the creek from the bridge, and then i went out trying to find a pool which i will go to later.  That had to be the longest bike ride i've had all season.  Hehe, fun fun fun!    Then i just sat down in my nice couch outside, had some gingerail miked with club soda, and read my star wars book (what a nerd! :p) Yeah, i had fun doing that as well.    It looks like another day of quitness with my computer.  I'll be home alone for most of the day actually.  My parents went out shopping this morning, and i enjoyed the peacefullness.  I will also enjoy the peace and quite when the leave after lunch to go to the nursery (for plants).    My BT download still hasn't gone anywere... *dissapointed*... i kind of wanted to listen to all of my c00lz songs.  On a much greater note, i downloaded all 6 eps of True Love Story - Summer Days and Yet, yesterday!  That only took about 2 hours, and it was much bigger than this OST.  So, i'm really stocked for anime.  I'm currently watching Infinate Ryvius, then i have Pia Carrot 2 DX, then i have True Love Story - Summer Days and Yet. ^_^  Thats a lot of watching.    I love the desktop wallpaper that i have now, but i think it might be a little risque.  It's such a nice wallpaper too.  I might change it... but i really like how it looks on my computer. Well, i guess i'm done being totally random.  Hopefully i'll have something to say tomorrow!  Lates
