I was against the idea of having any animals in the first place. I knew how the situation would end up. My mom would decide it'd be better off somewhere else, but Larry, my stepdad, wouldn't agree. He'd want to keep the dog, while not actually taking care of it... kind of like Seth (my BROTHER!). As I predicted, the situation is exactly that. The original idea was to get Seth used to being around dogs so he wouldn't grow up the way I did: petrified of dogs (the cause of which I'm still unaware of to this day). Anyways, it's a lost cause at this point, because if she were to send up on her two hind legs, she'd be taller than I am! This obviously doesn't help the situation with Seth. It actually makes everything in the back yard worse. I went out to our "library" in the storage building to get as many of my old books as I could. With my waterbed out and a long twin-sized bed in my room, I have more room with nothing to fill it with, so I plan on building a shelf to hold everything from DVD's, to CD's, to all my books and whatever else I can get to fit. I had forgotten how many books had accumulated over just the past couple of years. I had to make four trips from the storage building to the house. Of course, the storage building is in the back yard... with the dog. That's what brings up this whole subject. I really can't wait 'till we're able to get rid of her. Don't get me wrong, though. It's not that I totally dislike her, and I'm definitely not abusive or anything like that. The thing is, the only person who ever really goes in the back yard is Larry, and that's only to do his smoking and drinking, so I know she's not getting any love from him, especially during those times (note plural) in his days. She would just have a better life elsewhere, not to mention it would also take away quite a few responsibilities away from us, and with my mom starting her new job, she could use a reduction in responsibilities.  Oh yeah, if I haven't mentioned it yet, my mom got a new job! She's a teacher (so to speak) at Shreveport Christian Academy. I happen to have a few friends there so the thought of it sometimes borders awkwardness, but I'm just glad she'll be getting paid! Now if I could just find a job for myself, I might actually consider myself flat out happy.
