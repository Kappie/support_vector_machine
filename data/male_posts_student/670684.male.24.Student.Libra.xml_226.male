I hated my job for a few days, but yesterday I designed and created an owner's manual and then today started rebuilding the website for the company. The boss man was so happy that he now has lots of design and publishing work for me to do! It took a week or so before he could start trusting me with the bigtime stuff but now its full swing baby! I got to edit photos and play until my heart was content in Photoshop yesterday and then today drive myself into a frenzy in Dreamwaver. Next week, I'm going to develop a new ad campaign for him and rework all of the previously created owner's manuals that leave much to be desired.  Man, I am starting to remember how truly happy this kind of work makes me! If the whole acting/directing/getting my own sitcom thing does work out, I know I'll atleast be employable and highly desirable as the Marketing and Public Relations Director for a theatre company. And I won't be unhappy about that. Of course, I'm not going to let go of my greatest dreams for it, but it's certainly a backup plan that I can live with if the dream doesn't become a reality...
