Friends...i classified them in 2 grps.Casual and close.CLose are the ones whom you can be friends for the life time, always doing the little things for each other.Casual are just the ones you can hang out with when you are lonely.You dun really know how's the character of casual friends.But close friends(brothers), really understand you well.even though we bickers and have some misunderstandings, we are together again after we are cooled down.Well...one can make lots of friends, but a brother is for a lifetime,casual friends are just for a moment.  my bRothERs lisTS                   1)bendy                            2)tanghoe 3)alvin 4)enoch 5)zhicong  the one-->melisSa
