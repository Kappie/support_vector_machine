It fixed me with its glossy blackbird eye. "Cheep cheep," It said. "Cheep chirp, tweet-tweet chirrup whistle-tweet." It nodded its head once, as if in satisfaction of a message well delivered, and immediately flew off again. I have no doubt that I have just been told something very important, or amusing, or wise. Perhaps all three. But my inability to speak Blackbird means that I will forever remain in ignorance. I knew I should have paid more attention to languages in school.   And to answer Shaney-poo’ s lil’ inquiry about the behavior of smoke, this was in regards to when Shane (my cousin/brother from Virginia) and I would sit outside on our patio and smoke cigarettes together, it was a form of escape, a form of release, it was our time.  Of course Samantha was always welcome.  Well, anyways one time we were smoking and Shane had opened up a new pack and went to crumble up the cellophane wrapper, and I grabbed it and blew some of my cigarette smoke into it as a trick called “the smoke waterfall”  To answer this, the smoke is contained within the wrapper and so by science all gases will fill the container first to equal a form of homeostasis then, it will try to equalize with the environment outside to make the illusion of a waterfall.               Naughty Naughty    One thing about having a school or office day like this is, you get bored. Well, no shit Sherlock, I suppose. But when I get bored In start thinking of things. Things to do. Naughty things. Things such as… (I have never done this minus the ones I admit) 1) Sending offensive e-mails from somebody else’s PC A fun one if there’s someone you really don’t like.   2) Changing the signs in the toilets The toilets are the only place in the modern office where you can be sure you aren’t under observation. Note all the signs saying things like  “Please do not put paper towels in the toilets.” Note the size of the sign and the font it is written in. If necessary take it down and photocopy it. Then produce your own version, exactly the same in style, only now it says, “Please do not wash baby dolphins down the sinks, as it makes them cry.” Or “Will fat people please use the downstairs facilities in case of ceiling collapse.” Or, on one spectacularly misanthropic occasion, “You really are a sad, worthless fucker. Why not kill yourself?” Most of the fun comes from sticking up a fresh one as soon as possible after the old ones have been torn down. Get steadily more offensive as you go along, and enjoy a quiet chuckle to yourself as you listen to the office gossip about the Phantom Sign-Producing Maniac. “If you’re sat on this toilet seat, you’ve probably caught tapeworms.” Ah, happy days.  3) Blatant theft of stationery And by ‘blatant’ I mean literally by the skipload. Pens, staplers, hole-punches, highlighters, diaries, A4 pads, guillotines, laminators (I actually have a laminating machine at home that I half-inched from a previous school… it’s run out of plastic sheets though.) And of course, reams and reams of computer paper, more than enough to print out a few hundred copies of your new, War And Peace-sized novel. Tippex. Pritt-sticks, Sellotape, calculators, permanent markers (By the boxload) labels, hole reinforcers, computer disks… You need never set foot in Staples again!  4) Having pornography delivered to the office in someone else’s name Oh, that one was funny.  5) Create your own ID card This one is best done at home. Scan your ID card and fiddle with the image on Photoshop, giving yourself (For example) horns and glowing red demon eyes. Change the wording underneath from “This pass does not entitle the user to access restricted areas” to the more fun “This pass entitles the user to the life of your firstborn child.” Cover with sticky-back plastic and slot into the holder in front of the old one. (An alternative is to simply replace your photo with a downloaded image of, say, Myra Hindley). Proceed to wear your new badge for at least three months without anybody noticing, especially the supposedly vigilant security guards at the front entrance. Think about how clever you are, and what fools you are surrounded by. Enjoy your smugness: This is your time.  There are others. Endless others. Just let the boredom be your guide… onward, my disciples, and destroy!
