I shall start with "Today is a meowing day." Better. I woke up at 8.30, bathed, came online, ate breakfast and went online some more. HaHa. I figured that I didn't do badly after all. My miscalculations. I got Os for Transfiguration, Potions (even named the ever first Student Of The Week! YAY!), History of Magic and one unknown subject (which I suspect is Divination). YaY!!   After that, I watched my recorded shows in Sat, namely Pokemon and 8 Simple Rules. Meow moo! The ending of 8 Simple Rules is so terribly funny! HAHAHAHAHA! Meow moo. Er hm.. I don't think most of you know what I am talking about, so meow.  Okie. I went on to play my FFX (and eat lunch). Woah! I have such a hard time on the route towards the beach. I got killed by the freaking sleep-inducing, fire breathing idiotic plant-like monster 4 times! 4 TIMES!!! I got so pek chek with walking all over again that I decided to use Tidus's Flee ability to flee every battle with that idiot plant. Well, I had a big boss battle with Sinspawn Gui. At first, I only wanted to test the waters, but as I fight and pummelled that idiotic monster, the more I wanted to stay on. Stayed on I did, and slained the monster I did, with little HP to go. Heh. How meowful! I felt very tired in the end. O.o!  After that, I went online till 6+, when I went to bath, ate dinner and came back online.    Hmmm. Ayiah. What I want to say again? I forgot le la...so much distractions! I think I end liao le. Oh yes oh yes! I always dream of very good dreams during Saturday night-Sunday morning. Very very good, and powerful too. Yes Yes. I must find out the influence of Saturdays have on cats dreaming. Meow moo meow!  Okay. See ya tonmorrow. Night blog!
