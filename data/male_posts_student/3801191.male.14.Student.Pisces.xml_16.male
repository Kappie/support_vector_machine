Anyawy, at least i was a lil better off than most, I was interviewed by fanny tan, aka DP2, aka, the Mortician's test dummy, aka, mrs-total-colour-cordination...sigh, the list goes on...  Sigh, the questions, the QUESTIONS, THEY BURNNNNNNNN.......  Small sample of our little delights for the soul of the tension fanatic...  What would be your ideal career?  Do u like travelling?  Ok, maybe not...  But seriously, wat do these questions have to do with my work attitude in the IB?  Wtf...  Sanctity...  My Sanity...  Wherefore art thou?
