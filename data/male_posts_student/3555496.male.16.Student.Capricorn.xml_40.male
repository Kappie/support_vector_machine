Even at the very beginning I was sure it would be a huge wasted boring summer, and for the most part I was right. Not much happened around these parts, and I think I would have been having more fun if I didn't live here. I do think I'd be much happier back at my old casa, even though it was small and shitty.  I wouldn't have to worry about homemade explosives, crazy FFA stalkers,   the most horrible band on the planet   , receiving one too many voicemails, calls from multiple teeny-boppers, trying to make something impossible work between two completely different people, ect . BUT, there's not much I can do; I can't pack up and move by myself, abandon my familia like that, so I'll just walk this whole thing off. September makes a whole year that I've been living in north Houston, and I figure if I can make it for a year, I can make it until I graduate. I'm ready to pack my shit and get out of here.    On the flipside of things,  urlLink Firefox  got an update. As Razo and I both know,  Mozilla Firefox is superior to Internet Explorer in every way . And anyone that doesn't use it ought to. And if they refuse, they should be shot. There's one good thing about my summer...    I bought some new batteries for my keyboard (WOOT!). Now I'm jammin' up a storm...even though I don't know what notes I'm playing. Whoever invented Treble Cleff should be shot.    My Asian homie from down south got me into this game called Gunbound. I wasn't too sure about it at first, I mean it just looked like some weird crazyass Asian hobby. But after messing around with it for an hour I actually thought it was a pretty sweet game. Then an hour turned into 10 and I was losing sleep. It reminds me of that old skool Cannon game all the "cool" people, including myself, used to run off of floppies on Mr. Carbajal's computers back in the day. I never liked that dude; he reminded me of a carnie because he smelled bad. Holy hell, that was the 7th grade. I'm getting old kids :(          urlLink             I learned a new phrase that I plan on using a lot more.  "Fuck the fuck off."  So when CrAzY goat-girl comes around during camp asking me out again and again I'm just going to have to look her straight in the eye(s) and say, "Hey, fuck the fuck off." Thanks Nancy.    Well tonight is THE last night (excluding Friday and Saturday nights) I'll be able to stay up til the wee hours of the morning for the next two weeks. And I have nothing to thank but Mr. Band. Thank you Mr. Band, for robbing me of my summer freedom.     At least it gives me something to do... cus I am  hella  bored.
