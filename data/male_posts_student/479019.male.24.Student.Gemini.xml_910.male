When you read about stuff like  urlLink this , or more  urlLink people dying , or watching the DVD on the  urlLink Rock Against Bush  compilation. It's hard to believe that there is karma / a just world. It's not just these distant events around the world. I can think of my everyday interactions with people. For some reason people tell me about the very bad things that have happened in their lives. This is both strangers and close friends... I hear about how people have done bad things to them, how they got hit with life threatening disease, about horrible accidents, losses, pain, anger, etc. Sometimes the weight of hearing these breaks me down. It's especially hard when you hear of these from people you really care about. Sometimes you wonder why all these things afflict people you care about, and you've mostly lived a damage free life.  **
