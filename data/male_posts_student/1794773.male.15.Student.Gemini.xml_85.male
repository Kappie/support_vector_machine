I don't know what you mean by needing a deal for Cedar Point.  But I know Dennis Weiss and Jake Petzold were kind of planning a trip to Cedar Point too.  I mean, we don't have to hang out with them the whole time, but if it's cheaper to have 2 more people then i guess we could ask them.  I don't really know what's going on I'm just stating some stuff than I know.  Okay, luv luv   Brittany Lou
