They "intelligently" laid off THE ENTIRE STAFF of Black Isle Studios, a division of Interplay, and the ones responsible for many enjoyable games, such as Fallout 2, and The Baldur's Gate series. Even though Interplay's in DEEP financial trouble, they decide to throw away their most promising asset, to concentrate on a game everyone hates. Check out the story as reported by "No Mutants Allowed"  urlLink here . Suck it HARD Interplay jackasses, hope you know that you ruined some good people's lives laying them off like that, and that you'll all BURN IN HELL!  Shit can't stop for the already deeply troubled Ozzy Osbourne. It was recently discovered that he was grossly over-medicated during the run of his reality tv-show, "the Osbournes", which caused him to be mostly incoherent, more than usual, and have limited coordination. He went to the hospital about a month ago to treat his tremors, which had suspiciously gotten worse. The doctor who had overprescribed the music legend was apparently accused of doing the same thing to various other patients, and  nearly  lost his license....nearly.... If that wasn't enoguh, the Ozzman was in an automobile accident earlier today!! His ATV crashed while he was driving it in his estate in southern England. He broke some ribs, his collarbone, and cracked some vertebrae in his neck. He had to get emergency surgery to help blood flow to an obstucted blood vessel. His injuries aren't expected to be life threatening...hopefully.  And with those pic things...I do  not  wanna see them, not mine at least. I just know they're gonna be terrible.
