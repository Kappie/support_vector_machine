To start off, it was tough having to go to Marysville. One, it was a long drive; a little over two-hours and two it was hot; 98 degrees when we got there/82 degrees when we left at midnight. But it was worth it!   Okay, we get there. In the parking lot, it's a nirvana of pot smokers, food stands, and merchandise stands. Lemme tell you, when we were snooping around the parking lot, seeing everyone’s shit, there was this dude selling tacos. Boy-o-boy, I was so close to buying one, but I was afraid I was going to get more than just a taco, ya know what I mean? I didn’t wanna get high off of a taco. But all and all, its like one big family, but a family of rock n roll/in trouble with the law/pot-heads/die-hard-fans.   As we entered the Sleep Train Amphitheatre you felt the music, the vibe, the pot. We arrived after Robert Hunter finished his opening set. We sat down in the hot summer sun fighting to get the last sip of my soda. Then, just as the sun went below the lawn behind us, there they were. Here came Bob Weir with his shorts and sandals, Phil Lesh with his famous red, white, and blue wrist-band on, and the rest.   The first act was special. Opening with some of their later songs. It was so refreshing to hear their music and have fun. Some songs of the first set were “Playing With the Band” and covered Van Morrison’s “Into the Mystic” (which truly was a highlight of the show). They continued jamming, each member getting their own time to shine in a magnificent way.   Between acts was next. My dad and I traded thoughts of the first act and what we hope to hear. We were in for a definite good show coming next!  The second act truly was “the show.” A lot more electric, loud, fun, and recognizable. They quickly rolled into other great songs. Also, they drove into some more great covers, doing songs like “After Midnight” and the one of Dead’s newest lead-guitarists let into Led Zeppelin’s “Over the Hills and Far Away” (which proved to be the best 6 minutes of the night). Many more songs were played in the warm night sky.   Deciding the beat the traffic home, we left 70 minutes into the second act. So we got out of our seats and we gazed at the stage as we left our seats to head to our car. As we drove out of the parking lot we heard two things; the gravel being kicked up under the tires and the Dead zooming into the magical song “Golden Road (To Unlimited Devotion).” As we continued to drive the song came to a halt and we could shortly hear the crowd shouting for more.   Now that I think back, this was a great show! The best concert I’ve ever been to! I don’t even know where to start, but I hope that you get the chance to see them live because they know how to rock out! I give this show 12/10 stars! An extra two because it was THAT great!!!   I was really, really when I found out that they played the song “Dark Star” the previous day. Oh well, I’ll see ‘em again!
