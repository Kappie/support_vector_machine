Well still, this site, www.doom9.org, I really need to remember. It has a lot of fact regarding different decodes. And you can download them too ;).  And much info about music and different DVD technics. I don't knwo why it would come in handy really, maybe when I have some weird movie that doesn't want to work. It also has a good forum and a nice glossary...
