Needless to say, I was not excited about this.  I made all but 150 back playing poker, which I now fancy myself as some sort of a player.  In other news, NU requires a $500 deposit by Friday. Hopefully, I will find out soon whether I got in anywhere else. Both UPenn and Berkeley, (I am expecting rejections from both) said they would tell me by the end of the week.  In other other news, no one else posts on the blog, so it's hard to know what the f is going on with everyone else.  Peace in the M-E.
