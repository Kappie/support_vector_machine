'Cause my inner voice is yelling There is a fist pressing against Anyone who thinks something compelling Our intuit we're taught to deny Oh yes our soul we're told is for selling! Get out from under them Resist and multiply! Get out from under precipice and see the sky Get out from under them Resist, unlearn, defy! Get out from under precipice and see the sky ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ No way could anyone other than Brandon "the invisible floating torso man" Boyd pull off using the word "precipice" in a song. Oh yes. Whilst I was scrolling through my lyrics sheet of "Make Yourself," I was all like, "Whoa, did he just say 'precipice'? Demn!"  I forgot to drink my morning coffee today. This coupled with my breakfast of a ham and cheese sandwich made for a rather shaky time in Chem 1. I swear, I would have fallen asleep right there in the chem pav had I not had a single shred of decency left in me. After our class, we discussed this presentation outline that we had to do. As is standard fare, we exchanged names, numbers, and the like. I was the only guy in the group, and while the girls were reading the notebook with our info, they were all like, "Who's this? Jaykie? That's your name?" I just laughed and said "I sound like a friggin' teddy bear." They said it wasn't bad at all. "Ang cute nga eh..." Right. Thank God for sympathy. I wanted to say my parents were both still high on sedatives when I finally came out, but I was late enough for Math 17 as it was.  Soc Sci 2 was wrapped up in record time: 45 minutes. Our prof had to be somewhere on Monday, so we had to finish our study on Saint Thomas Aquinas in one sitting. I swear, he should teach like that all the time. No bullshit, just straight to the point facts. I even understood the concept of Eternal Law! Hehe. On Thursday, we start with Macchiavelli. Joy!  My extra time gave me a chance to have lunch at Beach House. I used to think I could never eat lunch by myself, but it actually wasn't bad at all. The whole place was quiet 'cause everyone else still had classes andthere was practically no line. I suppose there's a first for everything...  With about an hour-and-a-half to spare, I sat down in front of our Philo 11 room. I just sat there by myself, thinking. Sure, I guess it bothered me a bit that everyone else I knew was starting to forgehis or herrespective posse, but I suppose socialization was never really my thing. This is who I am, this is how I am, and I will not change that for anybody. It is everybody else's responsibility to deal with me and accept me without trying to fit me into a mold. If they cannot handle that, it is their loss. Besides, life is sad enough when you have to live it by yourself, so it can only get sadder when you cannot even live with yourself. Bow.  After my last class, I walked to Central (yung malapit sa New Era) all the way from AS. Bad idea; my pants have never been so muddy. I had some errands to run; I needed a 2x2 picture for my ID tomorrow, plus I had to return a book that my third year adviser lent me. I was starting to be a regular at DPS; even the newer guards knew who I was by now. I had some time to kill until my adviser's last class would end, so I went to the canteen and had an early dinner. I've been eating their Chicken Katsudon for over three years now, and I remember all the changes that it underwent; the egg used to be raw, but they fry it beforehand more recently; the sauce gradually changed from semi-sweet to salty; the chili peppers were used in decreasing amounts, probably because of students complaining.   Everything was changing right before me. The typical DPS student used to talk much in a manner resembling, "Uy tol! Musta? Tang ina oo nga eh! Bad trip talaga tsong! Pare may nag-text!" Now, they're all, "Ma'am! Asan po si sir? Umalis na?! As in super kakaalis lang? As in exagg na kakaalis lang ha?! So like, pwede pa naming habulin?" Ack. Conyoticisms.  After a while, my adviser came to the faculty room. We discussed certain things, like, how I'm an autistic freak who goes it alone. Hey, she used to be like that she says, and she also has more friends who are way older than she is, so I figure 'cause  I'm  like that then I must be in good company. She had to leave shortly after, and so did I. When I got home, I got hold of our brand spankin' new Windows XP Pentium 4 PC! Woot! It's not on DSL though, but it is faster than before... Ahh, technology...  completely wrong thought of the day: G was my homie from don't-ya-know-me. We used to hang out a lot during my third year "PH34R TEH L337 ST4RCR4FTZ0RZ" days. He was a pretty kewl guy, but sometimes he was kinda creepy... *talking about certain totally wrong subjects while watching our classmates practice for a school presentation* G: Tol, alam mo ba, parang ano si *female classmate* ngayon. me: Ano? G: Alam mo na... Aroused... me: Ha? Bakit mo naman nasabi yan? G: Basta, nakikita ko eh... me: Ah, ok... How could he tell??!? I mean, geez, the girl was just there practicing and minding her own business and this dude next to me claims to know that she somehow feels a particular way at that moment? Like I said, he was kinda creepy...
