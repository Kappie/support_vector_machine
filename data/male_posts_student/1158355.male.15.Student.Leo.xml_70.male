We're not done with it yet but we will be soon, it sounds amazing. Then Paul had to go home and James, Mike and Matt slept over. We played James' amazing game... rolling gays where you basically roll around the floor beating the shit out of each other. It was hilarious at first until Heaton sqooshed me and James into the floor. We watched Signs, Austin Powers, the very end of The Fly II where they show the mutated golden retriever all sad and gross, and we watched Freddy Krouger but not all of it because Kaiser was complaining and wining about how it was too scary. I started falling asleep and Freddy was in my dream dancing with lepracauns. So Freddy isn't that bad after all. So we all fell asleep in the den and in the morning, played more music. It was an ultimate band practice. Then today, I bought my rug for my room and went to Pat's. Dan, Eric and Gavin were there. Yes. Now I'm preparing to be bored shitless because tonight I must babysit my sister because my parents are going bowling. Well fortunetly, tomorrow I'm going to my cousins for Mother's Day! w00t! ....Chigoom **door slammed**  One more thing... Kaiser is improving at guitar (= good job
