More comfirmed cases of clinical depression here than any there.  Is it any wonder that my minds on fire, imprisoned by the thought of what to. Preparation for my move from the Puyallup Gulag to Wallingford on track. Ahh, back to the land of Piecora's, Pagliacchi, Ivars and Dick's. Yes to the first three, nay to the latter.       Parenting the small T-Rex is a trip. 2.5 years old and in charge. Smacked a wall today in anger. Whoa.        The ambassador from Vulcan arrives soon. I wait.        There is no such thing as a final destination. If you haven't arrived, you're not there yet.        All said, living in Seattle IS all it's cracked up to be. I would add one more Angelino if I had my druthers.        I feel better.....thanks for letting me rant. RGS
