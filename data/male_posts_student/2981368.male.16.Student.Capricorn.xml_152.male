With both strong scoring and checking lines, the cup looks to be in sight for england  But seriously folks, were not gunna win cos we never do. If we lose to the fucking Krauts this time............. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  First game against France? I think we need to play this Senegal style! and ensure plenty of piss taking about their wolrd cup performance
