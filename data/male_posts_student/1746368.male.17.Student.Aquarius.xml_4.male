I stayed for like an hour and pretty much just walked Dominique work. It was kind of funny. Everytime she was done serving someone, someone else came in the door! Earlier we found a babysitter for my brother, so now I can go to the church picnic tomorrow.  Now, as my regular readers know (which is like 6 or 7 of you) I do a lot of web page design. If you didn't know that: I do a lot of web page design. Up until now, it would always be about one of my hobbies. Well, I am actually going to get a page just about me. It won't have much on it. I might add a message board or a guest book. It will probably be just about some of the thinks I think or the things I do. Maybe it will have a few music files on it, for your listening pleasure or maybe, if I can get the proper software, it will have one of my originals played by me. Techincally, I could do that now, but it wouldn't be played by me, just written. Maybe I should add a HTML page. Dedicated to helping the less fortunate learn that HTML coding is very very fun! Who knows, maybe this could be as big as  urlLink Lissa Explains it All .
