I've just got an 8-week pathology course left. Basically, that means I have no labs, no patients to see, no nothing, just a whole lot of book learning. I don't mind this at all because it means I can concentrate on one thing for once.  On Monday I worked for a few hours in the hyperbaric medicine department. High pressure oxygen is often used to expedite the healing process for your more difficult wounds. The most common hyperbaric patients seem to be diabetics (since T2DM is endemic in this country), but hypoxic patients also benefit from hyperbarics. Among other things I got to see an awfully narly food wound (caused by diabetic neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease) that made me a little bit queazy.  On Tuesday I had my final physical exam test. I got 237 out of 250 points, which is not bad I don't think.   On Wednesday I spent most of the day traveling to Corpus Christi for my 2-day preceptorship, which took place on Thursday and Friday. I was assigned to Dr. Vanderheiden who runs a family practice clinic at the Bay Area Medical Center at Corpus Christi. I quickly learned that Dr. V was a challenging physician to shadow. Dr. V frequently quizzes his students in front of patients and wastes no time letting you know what he thinks of you. At the end of the first day I was exhausted. I felt so stupid; I have got so incredibly much to learn. By the second day I had his personality figured out a little bit more and he had a better idea of where exactly I was in my training. By the end of the second day I felt much better and I now have a better idea of what my rotations will be like.   Today was all for me. I did nothing but relax and enjoy the beautiful day. Tomorrow I'll probably go and get a haircut.    Songs of the day   Love Profusion , Madonna, 2004.   Walk of Life , Dire Straits, 1985.  Good Stuff , Kelis, 1999.
