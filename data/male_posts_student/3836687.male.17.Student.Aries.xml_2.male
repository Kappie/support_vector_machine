I've tried keeping a diary before but have always failed but maybe this is the answer, who knows? I sure as hell don't.  there's something very primal about standing in a field while your embarrassingly drunk friend, sprawled on all fours, vomits and retches explosively. Its sort of, reassuring. The moon lights pale glow and the trees shaking and shivering in the wind, while the sound of vomit hitting the floor behind you, as you avert your eyes, cuts hard against the air, this is such stuff as dreams are made of, surely it doesn't get much better than this. But once your friend has told you for the hundredth time that he's cold but he doesn't want to move, he wants to go home but he doesn't want to stand up, that's when the fun really starts kicking off. Oh well, I suppose that that is how the cookie crumbles, If the situation is ever reversed, I will be sure to be as awkward and as irritating as is really possible.  I finished my a-levels a little while ago, last Wednesday and its all a bit weird, to know that I have already either failed or passed, that all my grades are out there sort of floating in the ether. That some poor unfortunate exam marker has to put up with my rubbish essays, that they have to try their best to decipher my frantic handwriting and somehow read through my lack of grammar to make sense of what they have in front of them, just enough to be able to give me an atrocious mark! I keep sitting down to watch television or listen to music and thinking 'I shouldn't be lazing around like this I should be working, before I realise now it really is too late, there is nothing to be done.  The stupid computer seems to be refusing me the privelege of posting this crap, I didn't think that computers were designed to be critical, and you'd think they could at least be a little more constructive, bastard. I'll try again but I may be back soon...
