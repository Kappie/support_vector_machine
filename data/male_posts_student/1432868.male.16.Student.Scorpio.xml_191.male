I took my ipod sat at my piano and listened to "The Luckiest" by Ben folds and tried to copy the piano part. It was hard but fun eventually I was able to get enough to start to sing the words and well that great. I don't think I could do that again any time soon though. I just got so lost in the music. I played beatifully my singing on the other hand needs some work but was passable.Later I found someone who did the same thing I did but wrote it all down so now I'm going off of that because it is a bit easier.  it's been a beatiful day
