Erik though is at boy scout camp so i dont have to deal with his insanity and anger.  Dad on the other hand has been here... he left today to join Erik up at the camp.  but goodness.  my Dad is a very emotionless ((unless is anger or annoyance)).  he likes to joke around and tease and stuff.  of course i doubt he ever thinks about how his "teasing" affects his children.  but if maybe i lash back and tell him to leave me alone or get irritated then he goes into this big speech bout how teasing helps prepare you for the real world.  i can see that.  but maybe people need to STOP TEASING to prepare themselves for the real world where NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO BE TEASED!  ugh.  i have so much built up anger.  its terrible.  after all the time with the psychiatrist i've been able to handle my emotions and feelings better... of course to me that's involved hiding them away.  i dunno.  alot of times its easier for me to hide how i feel.  maybe i'm just scared to.  it DOES seem that everytime i voice my opinion or try and talk bout how i feel that my parents or siblings get hurt or irritated.  i dunno.  its just so frustrated.  my parents want me to talk to them... but i feel so "pushed away" by them.  and i know this is probably just some silly little teenage attitude that will most likely pass... but sometimes i wonder if i'm not just bein a crazy teen.  but yeah.  Dad's real insensitive.  to him emotions get in the way and its easier to keep them to a minimum.  to me emotions are life.  i admit that i do let them control too much of me at times... but i try not to appear controled by them.  course i guess thats not "managing" them.  but whatever.  i remember one time my psychiatrist asked me "You talk about how you're very similar to your mom.  Are there any similarities between you and your dad?"  i remember that so clearly.  i couldnt answer her.  i could think of nothing.  and i know its sad.  but i dont feel like his son.  i mean half the time i'm afraid to talk to him.  i hate askin him for things too.  i feel so guilty askin for anything.  but yeah.  done with Dad.  lets talk bout the brother.  Erik.  man.  that child is outta control.  not really.  but his attitude and temper are outta control.  he makes this house to be a living hell.  i despise this house mainly because of him.  Dad i can handle i guess cuz he's not home half the time.  but Erik... goodness.  it is so frustrating living with someone like him.  all he does is complain.  all he does is be totally negative.  all he does get angry.  and just bein around him stresses me out.  i know that its really just the codependent side of me.  if i cant help him or makin him happy or just stop him from bein so negative then i get so unhappy with myself.  yes i know its stupid... but i've always been that way.  i've heard all the little explanations as to why i shouldnt feel that way but i cant help it.  i've learned to handle or hide the stress but i cant stop bein codependent.  ha.  at least not yet.  yanno.  i've been thinkin ((i know shocking!)).  i've always thought that you're home is like your safe place.  you're place to rest and just be away from all the stresses of the world.  i feel happier and safer in the world.  give me the stress of the world.  i can handle that.  i can live with that.
