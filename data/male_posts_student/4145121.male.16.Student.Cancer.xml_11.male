Prefectorial Board...just duties and discipline stuff...and worse still, hated by literally the whole school. It's like...I feel bad for the prefects, especially those who are extremely hated. Like, why the hell must they suffer because they're doing their job?! I myself am a prefect. But it's like... I try to be flexible when I need to and stuff, so it's more like a service to the school in that way. But some prefects just don't get it and are just so stiff with e rules in school. "We are ultimately serving the school and the students, not making it a living hell for students. We can bend the rules, as long as it's a good reason and a good cause that is behind supporting it." That's what my senior told me in sec2 when  I was still in the council. It means a lot to me...cause despite the fact that we're student leaders, we must still realise we're also students, just like everyone else. And maybe, just maybe, we should take off our ties and think like a normal student for a day, not a prefect, then we can reflect on how we've done as student leaders.
