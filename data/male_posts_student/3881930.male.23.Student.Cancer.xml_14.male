YANTING i think i cant help you in the bills u better find you other male friend or ur best friend for that at least u still go out with them but not me. i noe if u borrow money from them they will in the future wont go out with you coz they scare u will ask them to lent u money as for me coz u nvr lik to go out with me so u wont have to face me thats why u ask me to lent u money. well i guess im not goi to help u this time u better firnd ur friends for help the 1s ur call it friends not me i noe.
