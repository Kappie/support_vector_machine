SU is Sonic Underground, a little known Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon featuring Sonic and his siblings, Sonia and Manic, searching for their mother, Queen Aleena. SatAM is a Saturday morning Sonic cartoon featuring Sonic, Tails, Princess Sally, and all their freedom fighter friends. SatAM DVDs can't be released because of third party rights. The culprits? Disney and Buena Vista. At the time SatAM was created, Disney owned DiC, which created SatAM. The only reason SU wasn't condemned by 3rd party rights was because it was made by a low budget company who worked for DiC. Finally, most people think that if enough people buy SU DVDs, that DiC will be able to make SatAM DVDs for reasons I don't know. So until next time, buy, buy, buy!
