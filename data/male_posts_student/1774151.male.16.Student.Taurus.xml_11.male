The expert says only vegetarians should be allowed to run for public office -- including the presidency!   "Bone-biters are too aggressive, too prone to physical violence and too quick to pick a fight," declares Dr. Anthony Weltz of Cleveland.  "In short, they're unsuited to public office -- and unfortunately, that includes our current President George W. Bush, an unrepentant carnivore with a well-known affinity for Texas steak.  "By contrast, vegetarians are much more placid, nonaggressive and empathetic toward others. They are the ideal people to lead this nation and pursue the goal of world peace."   Such a criterion, if imposed, would trim the current field of presidential contenders considerably, leaving only Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich, an avowed vegetarian, as a possible commander-in-chief.  "I'm not in the business of endorsing particular candidates, but Mr. Kucinich's public statements about Bush's reckless invasion of Iraq -- which is swiftly leading our nation to ruin -- certainly indicate a far less belligerent mindset," the sociologist says.  Dr. Weltz, himself a longtime vegan, argues that people who chose a vegetarian diet tend to be more sensitive and humane. Moreover, the very act of eating animal flesh promotes a more primal, bestial mentality.  "You are what you eat," Dr. Weltz explains. "When you routinely rip apart animal flesh with your teeth like a jungle predator, the most base and primitive part of your brain is activated and takes control.  "Restricting oneself to a vegetarian diet ensures that the most civilized part of the brain -- the part responsible for agriculture, art, barter and great cities -- comes to the fore."  Dr. Weltz points to the many examples of great vegetarian leaders, ranging from India's Mahatma Gandhi, a universally revered man of peace, to famed women's suffrage crusader Susan B. Anthony.   "In addition, many great thinkers, including Confucius, Leonardo da Vinci and Henry David Thoreau were vegetarians," Dr. Weltz reveals. "A body that's meat-free means a mind uncluttered by savage impulses."   The expert says people often try to play "gotcha" with him by pointing out that Nazi warmonger Adolf Hitler was also a vegetarian.   "That's a misconception. Hitler only pretended to be a vegetarian as part of his public image as the 'spiritually pure' father of his nation," Dr. Weltz insists. "In reality, he was a bone-biter from way back and he loved his bratwurst and beer as much as any other German."  I just found that pretty interesting....perhaps true?
