I am definitely a happy sort of person. (This may not be evidenced by these first entries.) But, whenever she moans about how bad a writer she is, she drags me down with her. I start saying I'm a bad writer! But I'm not! I say it out of sympathy, but then I feel like  it's true . And I don't like that feeling. I am a good writer, I know it, I write circles around the competition. (Modesty be damned.) And I also know that people that do nothing but feel sorry for themselves really piss me off. I have not had a perfect life! Do I give a damn? No! I have fun. And a lot of it.  Which is why I am confused as to why I like this rather depressed, gothic person. I like her a hell of a lot. What I don't like is her going on and on about her life sucks, and reading her blog and seeing that I am like the only important thing in it. On and on she goes!  I don't care if she did kill her dog. No regret. Never. I do not regret exploding on her yesterday, now that I am a little less panicked. Not at all.
