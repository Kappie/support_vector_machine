Basically, last night me and ingrid went to a movie then i was telling ehr about the male model contest and she said she would go, so we went. We got there, looked at pretty males for about 5 minuits (that's how long they were on stage for) and then we danced for a while. All in all a pretty tame night right? Wrong! After that, as we were leaving, guess who I saw? that's right, the world's hottest male... Steve! he was leaving too, so I didn't get to say anything. But then it turned out he was just going to his car for a few seconds, then he turned around and came back! I managed to say "hey Steve." Impressed? Yeah, me neither. The impressive part came when I ... wait for it.. GAVE HIM MY NUMBER. Yeah ok, it wasn't actualy as in lets go on a date and have sex number it was a someone's organising something with the blokes, i'll give you a call when i know what number giving thing. exciting none the less, because it means i can run into him at the tav more foten now
