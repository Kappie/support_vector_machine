Anyway, my cruise was AMAZING and I actually got something similar to a tan (it's still reddish).  I burn SO easily...ick.  Anyways, I'm sad I missed JournalCon and "bitchpants".  Sounds like a super-great time, though.  I answered all those questions!  Yay!  And congrats, Erin, on the new fan fiction!  It's fun stuff, and your title sounds like coolness.  Ha, I'm still in editing mode, I just changed the last sentence because the phrase "sounds coolness" wouldn't have worked.  Crazy stuff.  Anyway, bye bye!   It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.
