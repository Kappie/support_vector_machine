It's going to surely get exceedingly worse as the Easter holiday approaches, as the capitalist advertising temptation also known as Easter comes into full throttle. God knows how I'm going to survive this Friday, Sunday and Monday at work with the mountain of Easter eggs at my disposal *sighs*. I guess my will power will have to be on full alert and my eyesight somewhat temporarily afflicted with some tropical infection to survive the war against the flab - but I'm determined to do it.  Oh and by the way . . .  thanks Jen for the birthday mention, made me feel all warm inside, even if the hot chocolate at the time didn't.  xBuBzx
