Wouldn't it be cool to be one of those people who win a billion dollars so then i would actually be able to be lazy FOREVER!  The chances of winning is 1 in a billion though so i guess i'll forget about that one.  My new decision in life is to be a doctor of some sort (dont laugh, i really do get decent grades) I dont really know what kind of doctor, maybe a surgeon?      Theres this one song of Smile Empty Soul that is the exact same thing of something i wrote...same damn notes and everything, wouldn't that piss you off?  Well at least it shows that i have the potential, i just have to be lucky as hell (i dont think i'll get anywhere though, so dont worry)...stupid smile empty soul.    There is also this girl talking about me on her xanga and commenting on mine and they know me and riley and i'm so confused!!!!! I know they're just messing with me but whoever you are, you better tell me before i freak out. (http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=chickadee_3   is the site that this crazy person is talking about me on) I'm freaking out because they claim to be 17 and they just went on vacation but i dont know anyone to fit that description.  They also think i have red hair BLAH I DONT KNOW WHATS GOING ON!!!!!!!!!
