(the same thing happened with my mission call to hawaii). when they told me which calling they wanted me to serve, i didn't know what to say. i almost said no, but i knew i would hate myself if i did. i told the high counselor that i needed some time to pray about it. to get my heart  and mind in the right setting. i didn't want to accept (and especially sustained) unless i was fully into it. i prayed most of sacrament meeting and met with the bish to discuss what he would require. i feel good about it now.
