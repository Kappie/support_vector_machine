So he told me that girls are more interested in what type of car a guy has rather than the guy itself. So he told me a story about his friend who is butt ugly. Anyways, he has a Honda Intergra, all modified with 19" crome wheels. But even though he's REALLY ugly, this REALLY hot chick had sex with him. All because he has a cool car o.O  Now this is actually true, because i was cruising with my friends in this really cool car. We stopped at a neighbourhood supermarket. Some chicks came up to us and asked us if we were doing anything. Now we all said we had girlfriends because it was obvious the girls just wanted us for the car. So i guess my hypothesis that Australian girls are shallow is correct xD  Anyways i'll put the pic of the type of car Australian girls are into.
