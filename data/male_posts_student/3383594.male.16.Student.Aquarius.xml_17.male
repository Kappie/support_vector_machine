I was hoping Portugal equalise as my bet was on them to win. It was a rather exciting match, and at the 83rd min, the 2 subsitutes for Portugal made managed to craft out a goal. Simao crossed in the ball to Postiga, who headed home the equaliser. Sol Campbell from England actually scored a late winner in the 90th min, but the goal was disallowed due to a foul.   The match went to extra time with tt silver goal rule. Rui Costa from Portugal managed to score a goal 5mins into the second half of extra time. Portugal thought tt was gonna be the winner and so did England's Coach, Sven Goran Eriksson. With 5mins remaining, England equalise thru Frank Lampard.   This led the match to penalties. England was first wif David Beckham. I knew tt he was gonna miss it rite frm the veri moment he stepped up and he did. In Euro 2004, he missed 2 penalities, which caused his team to lose. The first miss was against France. Rui Costa also missed the penalty for Portugal. Vassell's penalty was saved by Ricardo, who also took Portugal's last penalty and send them thru to the semi-finals. Tt was a realli thrilling match and the results were pleasing too. L0L!  I slept after the match till like 1pm. I woke up for lunch and did my fnn coursework till like 4pm. I met Benson around 5pm and we went to Bugis Junction to get his b'dae present. L0L! Man was tt costly! Half of my savings were basically gone after buying him tt! L0L! Well, but seriously all my savings will be gone in no time as I still owe some ppl their b'dae presents. L0L! We walked around and had dinner b4 going home. On the MRT home, we were deciding if we shld go for a game of pool. I decided not to in the end as I was too tired to do so.   Anyway, for those ppl who I've not gotten presents for yet, hehe, pls be patient. I'll look into it, seriously I will. I decided to get Benson's b'dae present first cuz it was the cheapest compared to the rest! L0L! Honestly, his b'dae present is the most expensive present I've bought for anyone yet. -.= But nvm bout' tt cuz others are demanding more frm me! L0L! But I'll see into it ya? Juz gimme some time ok? Alrite den, cya around guys~! =]
