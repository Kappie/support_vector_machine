Some song is playing in the background (...maybe "crab dance" by Cat Stevens).  One of the "Grad School" episodes, maybe another one besides the New Guy or the Group Project, should contain the bit from the original full-length movie idea - "Can you watch this form me?" There are some good ideas that could spring from that.  Love interest - Phil has a recurring crush on Dawn, who he thinks likes Spence. Dawn, meanwhile, does like Spence but not romantically and has no intentions of dating him. STEREOTYPICAL SITUATION: Phil tries to get the courage to ask Dawn out on a date, but when he's ready Spence interrupts and gives her an invitation to a party.  Larissa had an idea today... inspired by Point Break and countless other sweet movies, she likes the idea of including a chase scene in one of the episodes of "grad school" (or "public policy" or whatever else we end up calling it) that involves running through numerous private residences and backyards and apartments. I like the idea, but I'm wondering about the feasibility with no budget. Obviously classroom scenes are possible because we could use classrooms at LPHS, IIT (thanks to Stasi), or Depaul...  THE GROUP PROJECT IDEA: Along with the other montages, perhaps before the presentation the students can look at each other and all at one say "what we need now are... NEW OUTFITS!"followed by a changing-room montage.
