We saw Rilo Kiley, The Moving Units, Phantom Planet, the former ladies of the Supremes, and heard Isaac Hayes as we walked away. I got to hang out with or talk to Toni-Lynne, Diana, Steff, Andy, Derek, Hayden, and Esther today.   I'm really tired. Lots of walking and driving today.  Los Angeles is cool though. I'm gonna miss it when I leave Wednesday night.  ****
