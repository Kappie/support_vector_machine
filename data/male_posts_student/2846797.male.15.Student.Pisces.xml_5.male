I also had a game tonight and we won 3-2. Had a couple of chances at a goal but still left with an assist. Best lol Sunday on Fox ever. Simon should be a prement charcter on the Simpsons. Also my dad's computer is on the fritz so we might be getting a new computer or a new harddrive for it. By the way the iPod rocks.
