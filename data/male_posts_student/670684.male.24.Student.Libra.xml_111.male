I know that I am going to have to click the Inbox link, and see that two of the emails are about enlarging my penis (I forward all of those to Daniel Young), another two are about webcams that are supposed to act both as security cameras and cheap porno filmers, one about some silly shit regarding University campaign teams for Student Government.  At  urlLink Centenary's SGA , we didn't worry about parties.  If more than one person was running, the competition was celebrated!  You could always count on 15-20 freshman running for the four freshman seats...but only 6-8 sophomores would run.  Anyway, we're now down to nine messages.  One will be my mom telling me that she is going to call the hospitals to make sure I didn't die in the icestorm.  Another two will be from the RTF Grad Office, telling me that Maureen is going to be out of the office or I can try to get a Latino Studies paper published in some 'zine.  One will regard my fantasy baseball team, and I'm not afraid to tell you that.  Another one will be a joke forward from my dad, almost always a joke that I've already seen or I don't want to see.  And to save you the time, the only joke that I do want to see is the one about the professor and the paper asking if Hell is endothermic or exothermic.  Good shit.   So we're down to four emails.  One will be from Harge, telling me to level Chinua.  Another will be from Will Kordsmeier.  There's a good chance another will be from Abdul Kelani, talking about the problems of war (though he gives me some great info from newspresses around the world).  So it is bothersome when that one lone email that I don't expect to get goes like this:   Rolin, I was cleaning out my daughter's room (turning it into a hunting lodge) when I found a box of Kiss of Mint condoms and a tube of KY.  Using my beginner's detective kit, I ran fingerprints on both items and found your greasy smudges all over them.  You told me you loved my daughter for her mind.  And her breasts.  I can take that, but sex outside the covenant of marriage?  That's not you, Rolin.    I know you don't see my daughter anymore, but hate is a fire that is constantlly fueled.  Don't walk down any dark alleys.  And watch your back.  Remember, I still have the tube of KY.   I watched  urlLink Crimes  Misdemeanors  yesterda.  If I can spot flaws in Woody Allen's writing, does that mean I am good?  Of course, I can spot flaws in my own writing.
