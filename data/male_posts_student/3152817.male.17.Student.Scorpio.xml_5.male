    
       For those of you who took the time out of your busy lives (you can't possibly have much of a life if you're reading MY blog) I'd like to tell you it's time well spent.  It is here, and here alone, that you have the opportunity to read up on all my rants, opinions, and thoughts that you missed during the day.  As you continue to read through this wealth of information, you're mind will be expanded, your heart will be touched, and you will never be the same again.
