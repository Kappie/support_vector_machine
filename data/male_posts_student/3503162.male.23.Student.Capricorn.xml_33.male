Most likely yes.  Lots of work to do, more than people think I've got, more than I would care to admit, but of course I cbf doing it.  Dont think its gonna be a pleasant three weeks, I know i've done jack, but look at me, idiocy creeping in.  Time to shoot myself with a elastic band, either that or bang my fist on the wall the next time somebody enters my room.
