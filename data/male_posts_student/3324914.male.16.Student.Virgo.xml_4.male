"free flowing." I know that doesn't explain much, but "hey".  I'm not saying it was baddly shot, I'm just saying it is different.  ...I'm thinking, "trailer-spot for a 'made for tv' movie." That sounds better then "free flowing." Is sounds weird, but thats just the way it is.  Other then that, this was another beautiful movie. I love Marvel and how they have now made movies to go along with the beautiful comics.  Stan Lee....  >... Woooooooooooo!  I give it six and ahalf gold coins out of seven gold coins.  __________________________________________________________________  000000Â½ out of 0000000
