With school coming up, I've been thinking about all the different crap that will be going on.  The classes, the teachers, the textbooks, and all we have to learn.  The teachers learn from the books, but who's to say the books aren't teaching them what they should?  So I started thinking...    Actually, I was just reading an article about textbooks in a media disinformation guide, but the other way makes me sound a lot more intelligent and thoughtful...  Just about everything we do in school revolves around what the textbook has to say.  Thanks to the virtual monopoly of public education, textbook publishers have a wide-ranging power to shape the ideas of kids like us.  In reality, textbooks do more to misinform and mislead than any other than any other print media.  Some of our most basic beliefs, even our view of America as a democracy, are shaped and distorted by school textbooks.  While this sounds completely ridiculous and has all the makings of a conspiracy that would rival Roswell, it will make more and less sense as you read on.  Looking at the areas of history, literature, and science, it's easy to see how textbooks fail (said the pubic school child).  First, history textbooks focus on names, dates, and places, rather than why it happened and the social and economic interests.  Second, literature textbooks give a censored and bland version of our literary heritage.  Third, science textbooks give a very detailed view of certain aspects and purposely shy away from larger concepts.  If you still don’t believe me, I don’t blame you, but at least join me in the utter confusion and hatred for Mel and Norma Gabler.  Mel and Norma Gabler, a married couple living in  Texas , are among some of the most influential in the textbook nation.  They've helped bring about the publishing, and the rejection, of 2/3 of America's textbooks.  The Gablers include in their guidelines for textbooks that these should "encourage loyalty" and avoid "defaming" the nations founders, and avoid material that might lead students to criticize his or her parents.  In one of Mel's creepiest statements, he criticized textbooks saying, "Too many textbooks and discussions leave students free to make up their mind about things."  So, in order to shut us up, we're bombarded with the memorization of factoids so were able to tell you who all the Civil War generals were, if we can point out Lexington on a map, or the date for the passage of amendments to the Constitution.  But we're never able to know  why  it's important to know why the Civil War started,  why  the Battle of Lexington took place, and  why  the amendments to the Constitution were necessary.  I could go on and on, but you'd stop reading right....               ......about.....               .....here.  So I'll just stop and say that I hope that someone with power catches on and makes a difference.  Just because were kids doesn't mean were stupid, and if we are, it's your fault.    Go America............ I pledge allegiance to the flag, and the United States of America.  And to the..... republic ???   For more on this weird crap and not just another plagiarism done by Nick Sanz-Gould, go to the  urlLink disinformation headquarters.
