Saturday's always fun, right? well, I'm babysitting all day, I'm getting two packs of ciggarettes (Camel Turkish blends :) ) and a 24 pack of beer for Mike, Jon, Jereme, and myself, 6 beers each (some might not have all of their's, so more for Jereme and myself! :). yeah... it's really boring at their house, so I brought them to mine... Mike's coming over, and Jon and Jereme are later too. I gotta go though... I'm supposed to watch them, not the computer screen... later.
