He suggested that the practice of  not  cleaning the ears is actually somewhat disgusting: something akin to not brushing one's teeth.     To me, not cleaing the ears is like not cleaning the bathtub (which I just cleaned).  It doesn't really make a difference: nobody but you is going to know it's dirty, and you can probably get over it.  But I understand: some people have the need to  feel  clean, rather than just appear clean.  To me, these people are crazy: who cares if you're dirty or clean, so long as you look good?  Actually, that's not what I think at all: I hate being dirty.  There are just certain regions that I accept as dirty.  They will always get dirty -- why fight them?  It is better to remain in ignorance.
