When I'm depressed I think a lot. This is a mixed blessing, as it may lead to good thoughts or just thoughts on why I shouldn't kill myself. It's just like that. When I'm depressed I seclude myself. Doesn't matter what anyone else says, only thing that matters is what I'm thinking. 2. It brings you close to people. No one likes being alone, unless you totally antisocial and wanted everyone dead, but that's a different story. You find people to be there that you thought didn't care.  3. It makes you observe your view of everything. For example, I came to the conclusion that there is no God, for if there was a God that only wanted good, then he would have not created me. Therefore, God is not an option for me, but you do become more spiritual and see more to this lifetime then afterlife. This may differ you may be closer to God, but for me it was further. 4. It made me more compassionate toward animals. Sure not all of them are great, but no one/thing's life should be taken from them/it. Everything has a natural right to live, and it is only up to them to make a decision if they want to kill themselves or not. No i'm not a vegetarian, but when you do eat meat, don't waste it, after all an animal did give it's life to feed you. Enough of my antiwasting ramp. 5. Some of the best works come out during depression, so write a lot. You'll get some good stuff out. Or I did in my case. Just write a lot and edit it later. 6. This is not really something you get out of depression but something to help it. Especially if your depressed about a girl, just watch a comedy, like American Pie. (Just rerun the Shannon Elizabeth sequence a couple times :p) Just watch a lot of comedies, it'll help you out of it. Or it did for me anyways. 7. Pain does seem real at this point, more real then anything else, but don't kill yourself. Life the first Noble Truth of Buddhism, Life is Suffering. It's ok to punch walls and do damage to yourself, that's nonlethal, if your totally depressed and find none of my information useful, either get help, or go ahead and kill yourself (Your choice there) 8. There is no #8  Well just some shit I've noticed when I was out of it. Hopefully someone will make use of it. And Connie, this is me, not you so it may differ. :p
