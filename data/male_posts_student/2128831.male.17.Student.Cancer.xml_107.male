This was introduced to me with the phrase that I subtitled this lil blurb with. Yep, "Climb up on that ladder and tame this dog" was a command issued by my father. I think my response was something like "what?" but of course I was walking toward dad who had just put an 8 foot A-style ladder next to the fence.  The dog, of course, is barking it's head off. But it was doing that earlier, when we were just standing in the back yard. Dad talked to it calmly and offered it dog biscuits. But, really, he was still a big stranger on a ladder reaching into the dog's domain. The dog was a little quieter after a while. And was totally silent once dad got down from his perch after a few minutes. However, the dog wasn't interested in the dog biscuits. I tried a little bit of one while we were talking on the back porch. It's like if Playdoh made Bisquick, but with no salt. Crunchy though, but not meant for human consumption, so I only had a little. I Say Call In Johnny Fairplay! About the biggest train wreck of a reality show that's out now, well, no, it really isn't The Restaurant season 2. I guess Showbiz Moms  Dads is significantly worse, but I'm talking about The Restaurant here. Seems that Rocco is a born loser on the order of Jason Dill. Well, Dill has real talent but some serious personality and/or time management issues. I recorded last weeks episode since I saw what this weeks was supposed to be about. See, this weeks episode is when Rocco tried to take back Rocco's. Yes, Jefferey, the guy who shelled out four million dollars to build the place and has lost $600,000 in the four months it's been open, has brought his people in. Rocco's people and Jefferey's people don't work and play well together. Especially Jefferey's now-fired flakey kid who called Rocco "Captain Douchebag". Though kudos for that, but [makes Trump movement] Your Fired! But this week's episode didn't air. Even though it made Yahoo's TV Picks for that day, somehow it got yanked. Maybe it has something to do with the preview clip where an unbathed and desperate Rocco croaks out "Sherry...get me my lawyer..."  Oh, and Rocco's secret recipie for his mom's meatballs:  The Seattle Times: Food: Recipe: Chef Rocco Dispirito's Mama's Meatballs. In any case, it's better reality TV than voting on Ruprick getting a million for losing Survivor.    For those of you who think cats, and human abuse by soldiers, have NOTHING to do with one another...  Cat killers outrage a nation   By LLOYD JONES AGAINST a global backdrop of outrage against the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers, another military scandal angered Australians this week - the victims, four kittens. he litter of a stray cats was held captive in a residential section of Lavarack Barracks in Townsville during an Easter Saturday drinking session involving six members of an army support battalion. One kitten was dragged behind a motorcycle on a rope and then crushed under the tie of a 4WD vehicle, while the others were doused with fuel and set alight.  Talkback radio lines ran hot and letters to the editor baskets filled up with angry demands for the six Townsville-based servicemen to be discharged from the Australian Army. Many drew parallels with the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers in Baghdad. The six soldiers pleaded guilty in Townsville Magistrates Court on Monday to cruelty to animals and were each fined $2000, although convictions were not recorded against them.  Each of the soldiers, aged from 19 to 26, also offered to do 100 hours of community service at Townsville's animal refuge, an offer swiftly rejected by the RSPCA. The RSPCA called for the soldiers' dismissal from the army and for the sentences to be appealed on the grounds they were manifestly inadequate, when the maximum penalty available was a $75,000 fine. National RSL president Major-General Bill Crews joined calls for the soldiers to be discharged, saying they had disgraced the service. But Defence Minister Robert Hill said although the incident was horrible and embarrassing for the Australian Defence Force, the culprits' service record should be examined before discharge was considered. He said it was up to the soldiers' commanders to take any further action. Those commanders will make their assessments knowing that many Australians want the soldiers marched out of the army. In some letters to the editor, writers drew parallels between the treatment of the kittens and the torture of Iraqi prisoners by American soldiers in Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison. "The Australian Army tries to tell us that Australian soldiers would never be involved in the kinds of humiliation and torture that US and British soldiers have perpetrated on Iraqi prisoners," Betty McLellan wrote to the Townsville Bulletin. "Violence is violence, whether the victim is a little kitten or another human being, and those who perpetrate gross acts of violence against animals and brag about it later are capable of anything." Margie Rowe wrote to the Canberra Times that the soldiers' actions made her sick. "I assumed they would be discharged from the army, as well as facing criminal penalties, but ... I find their records will be reviewed and a determination made as to whether they remain in our defence forces. "Unbelievable. Cruelty to animals is well established as an indicia of sociopathic behaviour and is common in the background of sadistic serial killers. Imagine what this lot would do if they were in Iraq." A similar point about sociopathic behaviour was made by RSPCA national president Hugh Wirth, who in a letter to Senator Hill urged that the soldiers be discharged.  Commander of 3rd Brigade at Lavarack Barracks, Brigadier David Morrison, said he shared the public's indignation over the torture of the kittens, which he described as disgusting. He said the soldiers would have to show cause why they should not be dismissed from the army.
