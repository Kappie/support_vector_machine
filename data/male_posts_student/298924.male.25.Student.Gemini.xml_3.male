I realize now that I am lazy and unmotivated....you see, as I type this, I should be in the Gross Anatomy lab studying every single cadaver in the room until I know every nerve, artery, duct, muscle, etc. in Back and Head/Neck I down cold.....but I'm up here by the window in this computer lab....typing in this blog that no one but me and two other people even know exists....why am I up here in this computer lab?....I took my new Miles Davis CD out of the CD player (Milestones....great music....) and replaced it with nothing....I could listen to Jigga again but I listen to it 3 times a day....the novelty is wearing thin and, as is usually the case, the ignorance and excess is beginning to show....  I found another blog to frequent.... urlLink Crystal  has quite a few nice blogs linked to her site but I think I have found a winner in  urlLink "Kelly" ....her musical tastes are similar to my own (I'm making this inference on what is listed in her Bio....not her weekly critique in the main blogs....) and I like her style....  as much time as I'm beginning to spend in the lab I think I am going to have to relinquish this excuse of not having enough time to design this site and chalk it up to laziness.....but what is new....  Which brings me full circle....why am I not downstairs peering into the skull of a dead person to try and find the abducens nerve?....well my classmates who I love, adore, admire, etc. are starting to annoy the holy hell out of me....they seem to be under the dillusion that I am an all knowing Gross Anatomy God and want me to help them find structures on their bodies....I ordinarily wouldn't be so frustrated with being in demand from dozens of lovely ladies, there is just one small problem....I DON'T KNOW THE STUFF!!....I'm not b.s.ing....I missed 21 questions on the Mock Practical.....but to my classmates I'm exaggerating, I'm grouchy, I'm selfish....nah shawty....I want to do better cuz the more I know the more I can give.....but they have frustrated me and forced me to go into hiding on the internet because I cannot express myself vocally to them in any non-offensive manner....  On to other thoughts....I am flirting with the notion of telling other people about this site....I have been assaulted by all sorts of thoughts from my evil mind about my motive for even creating this site....the only answer I can give myself is that I have created a need to write which last year was fostered by the newspaper and this year until recently had not been met....I also am coming to grips with the fact that despite (and maybe even because of) my vast insecurities I have a massive ego and I need to be shown approval....who knows....certainly not me....  Anyways this mindless rant is over now....I may meander down to the lab eventually....I may not....
