I almost want to take it out of context.  Oh well... yes if you couldn't have guessed this Lisa thing is still driving me nuts.  She didn't come to YG last night (which was a blast BTW.)  She had said that she might not come if her foot was hurting her.  Oh well.  I find it interesting how she isn't online by noon I almost wonder if she went out to a friends house.  I know I shouldn't be thinking so negatively but I can't help it.  I really feel she is avoiding me.  She won't talk about it either.  Every time I try she has to go.  I'm deciding if I want to write a letter or not.  I don't want to pressure her but I also can't stand not knowing.  I just want to know what is going on in her life and she won't tell me.  Which would be okay if she made it clear that she didn't want to tell me but she hasn't.  I'm sick of talking about this.  YG last night was good.  Jillian came it was fun to talk to her in person.  We were waiting for her and for Kristin.  Jen was funny.  We were waiting for Kristin.  "Just 5 more minutes... and after that 5 more and after that 5 more until she gets here."  We waited for 10 minutes then we went to the mini-golf course and left Kristin a note on the church door.  We got there and about 5 minutes after we got there Kristin pulled in.  We played in 3 groups.  Frank and Elaine with Nate and Jeff in one group.  Renee, Steph, Allison, Jillian, and Lydia in another.  Then Kyle, Kevin, Myself, Jen and Kristin in the last group.  It was fun.  I saw Dave Bernhardt but I didn't get to talk to him.  It was also pretty windy.  Being the genius I am I wore shorts and a light polyester shirt.  So I was a little on the chilled side.  Jen was our Martin for the night.  She managed to get a 5 on almost every hole.  She would just smack the ball as hard as she could.  We went back to the church and covered the cans for change donations.  I got them working on those and then I went upstairs to talk to Pat.  They got the sound system sounding beautiful now.  We can use the sidefills and the board runs much nicer.  Pat was showing me how to blast everything.  It was great... I can't wait to get in there sometime and get in trouble.  I have to put it to the test otherwise we won't know what it is capable of.  Then I went back downstairs and finished off some ice cream.  I also had an "accident" in which I sprayed the people behind me with the hose from the sink.  Kevin dumped his cup of water on my head after.  Renee gave the devo which was good.  Then back home and to my bed.  I found out that Allison and Jeff like dc Talk so I'm going to let them borrow my collection.  Then there was this morning.  I got up, went running (3 miles) in 21 minutes.  It wasn't a bad time but I should be able to do better.  I'm not telling anyone but my knees are killing me when I run.  I hope it is just them getting used to it but I don't know.  My dad is getting me a new little gadget he found while reading a magazine at therapy.  It is a watch with a GPS system built into it.  So it can tell you exact distances, your speed, you can set waypoints and it will help you keep pace.  It is a really cool thing.  So I should have it within 2 weeks.  Now I'm sitting here doing nothing but writing about my pathetic life.  But I just need to get these things off my chest before I explode.  Kyle asked me if I wanted to go to see Shrek 2 tomorrow.  IDK I know the only reason he wants me there is to say 1) he asked people and 2) so he can say Jeremy was there.  While I would like to see Shrek 2, we'll see.  I don't want to be there as someone's excuse.  It is Kyle, Kevin, Steph, and Jen so it is basically a double date.  Except they won't admit that and they want someone there to make it not a double date.  So thinking about it that way I don't think I'm going to go.  If they get enough people that it won't be me and one other person I might do it.  But if that other person is Lisa I don't know either.  Of course if she is avoiding me she won't want to go.  Then again she didn't like the first Shrek so she probably won't want to go to this one.  It looks like this Friday I'll be able to go to the Audio Adrenaline concert.  That is going to be a blast.  I am working Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday this week for Bobi doing AntiqueFest stuff.  No more priming walls or roofing roofs.  Well I'm gonna go code and hopefully not think about any of this.  Until the next time I need to think through things (probably tomorrow.)
