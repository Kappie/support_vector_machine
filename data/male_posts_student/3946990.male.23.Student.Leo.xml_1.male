More often than not, these people have grown up under the domination of a haranguing parent, and they would now rather suffer nearly any abuse than risk resembling the parent. Still others withhold their complaints out of fear that their love is unrequited and that they are worthwhile to the other person only upon the condition that they act complaintly. They go on through life on tiptoes, suspecting that their mate is waiting for the opportune moment to tell them that ther relationship is over; these people stand ready to make immense sacrifices to maintain a harmonious atmosphere, on the theory that discord would give their mate the opportunity he's been waiting for.  Nearly all these people believe that they've already tried to voice objections plainly,  have come to the sad conclusion that they weren't listened to. In some cases, the person's expression of dissatisfaction were vague; in others he has loaded his arguments with so many irrelevant  disagreeable comments that few would have listened to him patiently.  In an intimate relationship, when someone suffers as a result of another person's behaviour, the sufferer nearly always knows better than the other person which actions are causing him difficulty. If he doesn't make his objection, he predisposes himself to think the worst, that the other person knew he was inflicting pain, wanted to inflict it,  would have disregarded his pleas for better treatment if he had made such pleas. By deciding against voicing objections, we convince ourselves that other people are acting with rancor. By our silence, we imprint in our own minds the belief that objecting to the other person's behaviour would be pointless,  yet we would all be distressed if a loved one reached that conclusion about us, especially if we felt we had not been given a fair trial. It's an obligation of any friend to give us the chance to stop hurting him by telling us how we are douing so.  Complaining is an art  a responsibility,  like any art, it takes practice,  following new principles may feel unnatural at first. You may consider it a worthy plan to follow all the ground rules to be presented, in all your relationships. Making them hanitual may help avoid many kinds of confusion.    Complain to the person you think is harming you, and not to anyone else.  Try not to object to your mate's behaviour infront of anyone else.               To most people, being criticised feels like being personally attacked.  Don't compare the person's behaviour with that of other people.               Tell a girl that your former wife wouldn't have kept you waiting so long ,  you're almost sure to start a fight. No one wants to be described as inferior to someone else. Comparisons of this kind are always irrelevant. Our standards of our own performances must not be based on what other people do, but on what we believe we can do. Also beware of implied comparisons, like those conveyed by expressing disappointment with someone. The disappointing person is being compared with his better self.  Make your complaint as soon as you can i.e as soon as you are alone with the other person  can articulate it.                                                        Speaking up, like any task, becomes more difficult when you postpone it. If yozu criticise someone for what he did long ago, you will look like a brooder.  Don't repeat a point once you've made it  the other person has carefully considered it.                                                                                                  This means, don't expect a signed confession after you've spoken.  Object only to actions that the other person can change.                           You may ask a person not to shout, but if you ask him not to be angry with you, you are probably asking too much.  Make your complaints vocally, not facially.                                               Facial expressions of all kinds are outward complements of the spirit. Our expressions may be rich  various, but they cease to be when we use them as devices to convey messages we are reluctant to put into words.  Try to make only one complaint at a time.                                                      If you make more, you'll demoralize the other person,  perhaps obscure your major point. Don't quibble about the carpeting in your office when you've stormed in to ask your boss for a well-deserved promotion. If the subject changes to the price of carpets, you'll feel unsatisfied;  your boss may feel he's discharged his obligation by promising to have your carpet changed.  Don't preface your complaint.                                                                "Listen. There's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time. It may hurt you badly, but please don't feel offended by what I'm going to say... "  Don't apologize for your complaint after making it.  Avoid sarcasm.                                                                                                Among the invariable motivations of sarcasm are contempt  fear. Your contempt will predispose the other person not to heed you,  because you are making a choice not to confront him directly, you are intensifying your fear of him.  DOn't ask people why they are doing something to which you object. Ask them to stop if that is the underlying idea you wish to express.                  "Why are you interrupting me?" "Why are you putting your feet on my chair?" It's obvious in each case that the speaker wants the other person to stop an activity. Probably, he doesn't feel strong enough to make the request openly, so he cloaks it as a scientific-inquiry.  Rehearse your presentation if you need to.  Don't talk about other people's motivations when objecting to an activity. Tell them simply what they are doing,  if it is relevant, why you feel they ought not to do it. Here are examples of statements that are objectionable because they conclude irrelevant speculations about the motive of the offender: "You never want me to finish what I'm saying." "Quit trying to make me angry." Each of the statements run an unneccesary risk. It gives the listener reason to disregard your essential complaint if he concludes that your speculation about his motive is wrong. Look out for the tendency to confuse consequence  intention. The fact that someone is stepping on your foot doesn't logically imply that his intention was to hurt you.  Avoid words like "always"  "never"; they contain implicit references to the past.  If you never compliment the other person, don't expect him to remain open to your criticisms.                                                                                   Complaints ring loud  long when they are the only sounds that are made.
