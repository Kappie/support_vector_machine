I could have stuck the guy right at the start of the match if the mat was regulation sized. It was great. I got some major cheers on that one! I however then started gassing and screwed up my arm in the match and eventually got pinned myself. Oh well. It's no big deal.   I think my performance had to do with me not getting to bed until 4 AM. I hung out with some girls from Cambridge and Downtown Disney. It was lots of fun hanging out again.   Anyway I'm exhausted right now. I got a few hours of sleep when I got back from the tournament, but my sore arm and exhaustion is probably going to keep me in tonight. We'll see. Maybe Brandon will give me a call back and we can just drink a bit tonight.  ***
