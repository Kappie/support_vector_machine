Today I (and some friends) went bicycling, and I, being the person who is out of shape and that doesn't enjoy exercise, got tired quickly. It amazed me, then, that they wanted to go to another street which was about 20 blocks away. Now normally I wouldn't have care about that, but this is almost 30 C weather! I don't know how it is possible to bicycle for about an hour in 30 degree weather. Blech! Well it is about time I leave. The Protagonist is out.
