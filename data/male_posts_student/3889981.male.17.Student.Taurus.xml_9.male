You see, our group is admittedly the busiest group, witheach person having personal external commitments that can force us to our limits sometimes.    Especially when your group can only meet up once in the most important month of project work - report writing - and you haven't sorted out those surveys and evaluations yet.    PW is terrible. The work of the devil.    Maybe not that bad, but it's pretty much like the inverse of a light-year away.    Then again, the day wasn't that badly spent. In fact I must say that we were more productive than we were the past few meetings (possibly because everyone was actually present).    Try topicture this: tomorrow we go to school and we explain our absence by saying that we did project work because we cannot find a suitable day to meet. And Ms Lee accepts it.    I just can't picture that.    I predict that the dormant volcano will do some sneezing tomorrow. And it's not just flu. It's full-fledged lava-pneumonia.    Let's hope I live to update this blog the next day.  And the next.
