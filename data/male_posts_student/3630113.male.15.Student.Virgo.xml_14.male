Was putting up with excruciating headaches almost everyday...almost turned into a nocturnal creature..i was sleeping at odd times and waking up at times when even perfect 10 decided to desert me. Obviously i couldn't put up with it through the week..i let go...both physically and mentally...somehow i managed to reclaim the grasp and live another day...  Today was quite crap really. I mean..what's new? Waking up at 5+ again to do the RP presentation.. during which i realised couple hours later than aiks didn't make an effort to prepare for it..i was hoping for much betta competition..haha..not that he didn't do well..just that i know he can do excellently..even though he can translate his brilliant thoughts into words instantaneously...anw..no hard feelings yea?haha...didn't really mean it..=p As usual...laura ng popped in through the back door and saw that i was sort ofin the process ofinterpolating my "anti-thesis"..and she left with "this class is very good." oh no. she remembers me..i think...or probably some other class did very poorly or sth like that..allow me to take some credit..there ain't much worth accrediting for other parts of the day.  got back maths test..77 only..wth man..everyone was like damn easy damn easy..sure get 100 marks..and i think bout half the class got 90 and above? gawd...i was putting up with a headache and really couldn't really straighten out the mathematics. i calculated with my own brainless mind 6-8+20 = -22. sheesh..think i've got to go back to attend primary sch once again...  went for singing practice for class song..just in case you didn't know...mdm pregnant wong went to submit our class song to participate in some competition..with some "luck" we managed to emerge through to the finals..and we're supposed to perform on the 21st august and incidentally i was chosen...lol..that's the day my bro's coming back from the states..hopefully that day will turn out much better than today. so well..i really needn't some water to lubricate my throat..couldn't really reach the notes in the chorus..so was asking for water..it didn't really go very well..'cos i was having problems adjusting to the rythm and pace...haiz.  went to play soccer at street court...i wasn't really in the mood actually..i had once again injured my tailbone with some invaluable help from vincent soh...i wonder how it's gonna heal. Tried to be keeper...but oh my god...i was really losing concentration and i totally misjudged a back pass and took my eye off the ball for a split-second..and i actually flicked the ball into the goal through my legs...crap man..later really didn't wanna be keeper anymore my tailbone was proving really gonna hurt if i dived and injured it again...after that went to play again as outfield player...crap man..i was misplacing passes and making stupid moves and stuff...really wasn't focused..it was a crap game..we eventually lost to the evidently much better team who really were equipped with sublime skills...  I think i'm making an effort to improve my mood..i dun really wanna implicate anyone...most things that i really enjoy doing didn't exactly turn out well..they place me in a predicament in which i think that every thing is useless..and living is virtually useless. Seriously..speaking..singing...goalkeeping...stuff which make me feel some sense of ability..one which i can derive pride..pleasure..and respect..dammit..stuff haven't exactly been smooth-sailing..not that they're supposed to all the time anw..i guess it's a process i'll have to live with...i'm getting used to this process...learning and growing stronger...but i never wanna rue my chances ever again...i'm gonna take my chances...well...at least i know i tried when i fail. Well..something that i really enjoy the most isn't available to be something that i can indulge in..and yet it is something that hurts me the most..a knife stuck in the heart probably only "king arthur" can extract..ok forget the last part.it's crap.
