Now I am finally to my daily duty of uploading the shipping files to their respected shippers like UPS and the post office.  At least now I have something to do every time I go to work. What will I do with the rest of my afternoon, like I said, mimi is off today so hopeful we can go have some fun.  Christmas has completely left us broke so it seems. I think I have gone a little overboard with the presents but I want mimi and everyone to have a good christmas, its my favorite holiday and damn if I don't see people smiling.    urlLink check out dallas hardcore music
