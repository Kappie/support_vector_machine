Exactly  I find that I am given pennies from buying things that cos £X.99.   they are annoying, and too many of them are heavy and they take up space that could be taken up by more valuable tender.  I don’t have any valuable tender but I might get some and don’t want to give it to a cat as my wallet is full of pennies  So where do you put them.  I used to throw them out of the window onto a forest area with the idea that some exceedingly dull future person with a metal detector would get some excitement out of finding it, and the find would make him more dull as he added it to “the pile” of pennies and tennis balls that reside in the forest area.  Or at least a pigeon might choke on it  But then I discovered that the windowsill was about 10 cm by 150 cm of wasted space.  You couldn’t store a car in this area, or even an enchanting hat, but other things would fit.  Paper work would get soggy and blow away, a pet cat has already been tried on the windowsill: it fell off.  Pennies wouldn’t blow away though and if they get a bit rusty, I don’t care.  In fact I want to hand over pennies that although have a date of only 2002 on them, are rusty, green, and look diseased.  It was perfect and although I may never actually spend these pennies (no not that metaphor), whenever I am looking for something to talk about, I can stare the person deep into the eyes and say “I store pennies on my windowsill” and they will think I am very wise.  Probably.  Actually, looking at them now, I can see that I need to turn them, they are only rusted on one side.  Although maybe that is better, even more mystifying to a cashier to have half shiny, half green pennies handed to them.  Upon seeing this they may think I am very wise and will maybe wish to hand the money back in awe of what I have achieved.  Maybe if I cleaned up some old pennies and added them to then rusty new pennies I could claim I was a time traveller, then maybe if I claimed to be looking for sarah connor they might give me a motorcycle.  Anyway, I think they need some salt.
