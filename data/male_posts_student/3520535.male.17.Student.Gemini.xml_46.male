I did get some money put into my account at Langley, and went with Noah to some places, but didn't even get to speak to Sarah until last night. Even then, most of it was online because my phone died. Maybe that was a good thing. When you're talking on instant messenger, it allows you to pause and consider more of what you want to say, and we did have quite a lot to say. Though I did have to end a conversation with Chelsea when she sounded like she could have really used me, she sounded so sad. Anyway, I'm now in this really annoying situation. Emotionally, I'm on standby - I feel gidddy with excited happiness, and sad and depressed, frustrated at facts out of my control, and reigning in a desire to be overprotective. You see, now that Sarah and I have decided that what we are is dating, now comes the problems of everything else. She says it's best if her parents never know anything, because since she's leaving they would try and stop it and think that she'd be too depressed when she moves and we must part. Her sister or someone is coming or has come and so they may want her to spend more time over there and not let her go out. I'm effectively on car restriction because of my reckless driving ticket, I may have my license revoked, but I can drive once my parents leave on their cruise, if they go. And of course there's the problem of Sarah leaving. Goddam you Arizona... We only have one month and I'm worried that we won't be able to make the most of that time. She makes me so happy. And that's why I feel giddy. She really likes me. She wants what I want. We talked about our feelings and I had little to add other than an echo of what she said. But why? Why now that we're together can't we be together? Dammit, I have to spend time with you Sarah, it's been too long. When was it I last saw you? Saturday? I keep the ticket stub. It was a saturday. the 26th. So like a week and four days. It'll be two weeks. I can't let that happen. Maybe tomorrow. Sometime.
