First, Wednesday I had a test and a quiz in logic and two tests in Hardware. Talk about a lot of info to know. Well, I got a 92% on my two tests for Hardware. Then in Logic,*suspenseful drums playing* I had to memorize 18 rules for a quiz, then apply them in the test. During the test, our instructor graded our quizzes. I was freaking out. I figured I would get about 9 or 10 out of 18...I get it back, I got 15/18 and I don't think I could do it again to save my life. It just kinda came to me when it was needed. Then the test, I think I did alright, but will have to wait until Monday to find that out. It seemed too easy, so I am nervous...however, he does give partial credit. Will keep you posted.  Let's see, what else? I got bit a few days ago by something and it's really bugging me. It's swollen my ankle and places hurts in the muscle on my leg to just under my knee. I might have to get it checked if it's not better by next week. A classmate told me her Mom has the same thing, and she's going to the doctor for it. Maybe it'll save me a trip. She said she woudl E-mail me if I was going to die. She hasn't yet.  I still haven't picked up my Dad's ashes and he passed away May 2. The funeral home called and asked me if we were going to still pick them up. I explained that I'm between living arrangements and that the family hasn't decided what we're going to do yet or when. She understood and I tricked her by first asking, "Does it cost anything to store him there?" She said, "No, not at all." I said, "Good, then he might be there a while." I don't want to be one of those people that carry ashes around in the car or stick him in the closet. I know where he wants to be scattered, but the family wants to be involved. *rolls eyes*  Well, to the good stuff. I'm off to Canada for the weekend. It's the anual Vancouver trip with David and Beckey  Donna. God I love it up there. So in preperation for it, I have been going in Vancouver chat rooms. Last night after a fun night at the bar, I came home and went on-line. This guy and I are talking, hit it off pretty well, and then he asks for a picture. So I gave him my web site and he says, "Do you know Tyler from Abbotsford?" I said, "Yes, OMG, he's my ex." He said, "Have fun up here, peace." He wouldn't reply to my question of who he is or anything else. I found out from someone else his .com link and EW! Anyway...just kinda hit me hard considering I was just having a talk with a friend about him while driving home.  Well, I better get ready to go. I will talk more later and might update from Vancouver, time and Internet at the hotel working and permitting.  Have a great weekend and peace!  Jason
