Listen to the single and tell me if you agree.   urlLink Meant to Live -Switchfoot  Current  Billboard Hot 100  position: #18   urlLink Heaven -Los Lonely Boys  Current Billboard Hot 100 position: #19  It may not be irony, but it’s certainly worthy of mention that the #18 and #19 spots on this week’s  Billboard Hot 100  are in complete contradiction to each other; the higher single is  Switchfoot’s  “Meant to Live,” the lower single  Los Lonely Boys'  “Heaven.” “Meant to Live,” with its power-rock chorus (“We were meant to live for so much more”), speaks to spending your time on Earth to its fullest extent, narrating a tale of an anonymous “he” who seems to be hopeless in pursuit of that suggestion. “Heaven,” on the other hand, wants to abandon life’s current “prison” with an upward plea (“How far is heaven?”), all the while chugging through some Southwestern college rock that has made it the left-field single of the year (right there with  Modest Mouse’s  “Float On”). Also splitting the two tracks is the fact that one is an irresistible summer jam while the other is postmortem sludge, one deserving and one, well, not.  Switchfoot  seems to have invited the insult with “Meant…,” crafting an attempt at a triple-threat single by mixing rock/pop vocals, echoed grunge-updating guitars, and potentially Christian lyrics (like we needed another  P.O.D. ). That makes  Los Lonely Boys  the clear winner, as they croon blatantly religious lyrics over funk-spruced guitars, organs calls,  Santana -esque solos, and, best of all, a continually plucked bass line that wouldn’t be out of place in a  Michael Jackson  dance piece. On the  Switchfoot  hit,  Jonathan Foreman  (lead singer) poses a contemplative question: “Have we lost ourselves?”  Henry Garza  (Los Lonely vocalist) not only answers that query (“I’ve been lost in my own place”), but goes on to explain how he “need[s] to change.” That may be some good advice for  Switchfoot  to take.   Verdict 1:  Switchfoot - 4.4/10 - Brouhaha   (2.2/5)    Verdict 2:  Los Lonelies - 9.4/10 - The Fork     (4.7/5 )    2004 Best Singles Club Entry
