Actually this post is pretty much going to be a White House Press Briefing.   -	It’s amazing that since Sophia quit, she’s said more on the outside than she ever did as a Blogger. Not that I don’t want her to come back, I’m just saying. -	Okay, Thomas made a hilarious gaffe today. It’s number five on the list of hilarious puns Hilarious Gaffes and Typos 1. “I hate him with the power of a thousand flaming nuns!” – Someone at TwoP 2. “I’m too busty to get a job!” – Jonah 3. “I’m feeding my dick!” – Ashley  4. “Red Roof Inns don’t have Colonial Breakfast!” – Thomas 5. "Is that a homo?" - Tim on seeing a homeless person in Chicago.  Okay, so I've seen The Terminal, which was good, and I saw Shrek 2, which was more jokes than story this time, so it was almost but not quite as good as the first. I was saddened to hear that Jonah is staying in Marching Band, although I'm happy that he got a kick-ass deal to do it.   I also, in the spirit of giving, have new stuff for everyone including myself. I got The Simpsons Season Four on DVD, and TiVo for my dad for fathers day, and Presents for pretty much everyone else (blog-wise anyway)  Also my Cousin (and her boyfriend) are in town, and we're showing them the "Best of Indiana", which is roughly equivelent to "The Most Mediocre of Anywhere Else." However, due to some odd reason, neither of them have seen any of the Lord of the Rings movies, so we're giving them a crash course in Tolkien while they're here. Just our gift to them.  Okay, it's 11:30 and I have swimming tomorrow, so I have to go bye-bye now. Bye, everyone!  Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!
