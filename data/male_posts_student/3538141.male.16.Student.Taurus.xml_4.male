For once I actually positively enjoyed an English paper because it gave me a chance to express my opinion (for that, read 'be excessively opinionated').  This is a cut-down version of what I wrote (it might seem a little bit controversial and weird... but that's just me).  I believe in a school where individuality is important, and the individual pupils' needs are catered for, so that they are each treated like adult human beings rather than simply being a horde of machines waiting to have the relevant syllabus programmed into them.  Teachers, too, should not have constant restrictions imposed upon them, but should be able to teach the aspects of their subject that they consider to be more interesting in addition to the syllabus, in order to cultivate further interest in higher education in their pupils.   Here, I had to avoid bitching about the syllabus, because this was a GCSE exam.  Instead, I wrote about how schools could best take advantage of the syllabus   Obviously not everyone is going to benefit from this extended teaching, and there are plenty of people who know from an early age that they do not like subjects which they nonetheless have to do.  For this reason I suggest that we are setted according to ability for every subject - because I believe that in general, the more we enjoy a particular subject the better at it we will be, and vice versa, because we are more willing to put in extra time, or listen in class to something which we find interesing.  Therefore those in the higher sets will generally be those most interested in the subject, and after covering the syllabus their teachers can go on to teach them more advanced and, for them, more interesting topics.  Meanwhile, in the lower sets, the teachers are sticking more religiously to the syllabus in order that the candidates get good grades in public examinations - which is likely to be the most important thing for them in a subject which they do not enjoy.  To make this work, I think there also needs to be open discussion between teacher and pupil as to which sets a pupil should be in and why, and a pupil can contribute his own opinion to this.  It must be made clear that there is no shame in being in a lower set, but it simply means that your specific needs are being catered for so that you can focus more on the subjects you do enjoy.  While I fully realise that some are born more intelligent than others, I also believe that there is a strong correlation between how much one enjoys a subject and how good one is at it; I therefore believe that in being setted for every subject pupils would be able to more fully realise their potential and enjoy themselves more at school.   As I said, a rather cut-down version, but it gets the point across.  As ever, comments will be gladly received
