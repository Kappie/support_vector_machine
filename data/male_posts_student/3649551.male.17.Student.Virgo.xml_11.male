At least I think that's 'ride horses' in Spanish. It should be interesting ... I've been on a horse at one other point in my life. Anyway, AJ is going to teach me how to ride and I'm going to teach him how to throw a spear. Then we're going to combine the two and chuck spears from horseback. Damn, I wish I was born a few centuries earlier.
