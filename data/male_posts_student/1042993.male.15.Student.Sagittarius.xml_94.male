And, I don't know why I played it....   So, here's my roundup of what's happened over the last few days and since I last posted:    urlLink Skype  .  I tried out Skype last night (from the makers of KaZaA K++).  It's really kind of interesting and neat to use, but I didn't like it because you have to have Skype credit to even begin to use the stupid piece of software!  Also, keep in mind that it is  not  open-source...
