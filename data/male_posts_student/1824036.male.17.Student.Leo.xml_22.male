I guess what I am trying to say here is that some cell matches were quite a bit better than others. Before I go into this too much I would like to ask Drew to name his top 3 or 4 cell matches. This does not include the crappiest match ever (elimination chamber...because cell matches are cool...and chamber matches...well..they just suck!).  So Drew? Step up? What are your favorite Cell matches of all time??? Are we due for another? If so who should be in it and why?
