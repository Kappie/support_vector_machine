I am grateful, You have been with me even when I am disliked by masses. Why do you do this? I'm not worthy of your friendship yet you stay and listen. You always knew how to comfort me, Even among masses of people, you stand by me. Aren't you afraid that your reputation will be tarnished? A popular person standing by a nobody... Won't that phase you at all? Aren't you afraid of destroying everything that you worked for, For a selfish, ingrate fool?  Please open your eyes, Look at what you'll be risking. All you'll gain is nothing. All you have will become nothing. All you sacrificed for is nothing. All around you will be nothing. All you'll have is nothing. All you'll have is me...
