The knee joint, is separated by menisci (two discs that act as 'cushions'). Ligaments and muscles connect the femur (upper leg bone) and fibula and tibia (lower leg bones).  The quadricep tendon connects to the patella (kneecap) and to the quadriceps (upper leg muscles).  The patellar tendon connects the patella to the tibia.  Articular cartilage covers the ends of the bones.  In my opinion, the knee is a poorly designed joint for the stress it succumbs to. Although,  I am biased as you will understand after reading this essay. 	   	I began playing soccer for the Swift Current United provincial team in the year 2000.   We went to North Battleford for provincials that year.  In the final game, I scored to make the score 1 – 0.  We went on to be provincial champions in 2000.  I continued to play with Swift Current United in 2001 and 2002.  On July 6th, 2002, I was playing in the provincial southern playdowns in Regina.  Early into the first game was when my injury occurred.  The ball was in the open and I leaped  leading with my left leg in the air.  From my left, the larger opponent's knee hit the inside of my left knee.  As my left knee planted on the ground, his momentum kept moving through my knee. Consequently, his momentum dislocated it and tore my anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and some lateral meniscus.  Since that date, it has been an ongoing injury.  I have never played soccer since that day. I have experienced problems with other sports as well.  Football was too vigorous with the tackling and planting.  Hockey, on the other hand, was do-able. In hockey, I was able  to favor my left leg, putting more stress on the other.  I am conscience of when I am going to be hit into the boards to brace myself with my right leg, protecting the left.   	 	I had a knee brace that enabled me to be active.  The brace was  to "help prevent" further injury of the knee.  That's exactly what the brace did, it assisted in stability. Although, it was not very effective.  This custom fit brace featured ultra-light carbon composite frame and weighed under 25 oz.   It was also equipped with dual hinges and a full extension lock.  Also, the custom paint job I picked, flames, is pretty awesome.  For $1900.00, my knee still wanted to dislocate nearly every hockey game.  Other than the pain which I became immune to, this Innovation Sports CTi2 knee brace allowed me to play a sport I love.   urlLink    CTi² Knee Brace 1   urlLink    CTi² Knee Brace 2 	 	Two years after the initial injury, my growth plates were finally closed.  Meaning, I was done growing and ready for surgery on January 8th, 2004. 	 	ACL reconstructive surgery is a somewhat complicated procedure.  The purpose of the surgery is to restore normal stability and function of the knee, limit the loss of function in the knee, and prevent injury to the other knee.  In my case, the ACL was completely tore so it needed to be replaced.  To do so, a graft, made from strong material, would be found elsewhere on my body.  The common grafts used are the patellar tendon or hamstring muscle.  My doctor, Dr. Michael Paul Bering, decided to use open surgery with a graft from my patellar tendon.  The surgery was originally booked for two and a half hours at Medicine Hat Regional Hospital.  On March 1st, 2004, at about 10:00 am, I was moved out of my room and into the operating room.  I met with my doctor to go over everything and took a relaxant.  Immediately after arriving in the operating room, I was transferred onto a narrow operating bed where I was met by my anesthesiologist.  My arms were extended out from my sides, and a needle was injected into my left arm.  The last thing I remember, is telling the anesthesiologist, "I don't think it's working."   For this procedure, I was under general anesthesia.  The doctor then makes the incision down the front of the knee, approximately two inches.  There was four other small incisions around the knee.  One was used to pump sterile saline solution to expand the knee and wash blood from the area.  This hole was also used to insert a tube which led to a pump that aided in the drainage of the blood after the surgery.  The other three holes were for the arthoscopic equipment.  A tool with a camera on the end takes digital images and are displayed on a monitor in the operating room.  Surgical drills were placed through the small incisions.  The doctor drills holes in the upper and lower leg bones forming a tunnel.  This "passage" will be used for the new tendon graft.  At this stage, the doctor takes a graft from the middle of the patellar tendon.  The doctor, also removes small pieces of bone from either end called "bone blocks".  This new graft is pulled through the "tunnels" in the upper and lower leg bones.  The bone grafts are now secured into place by a screw at either end.  The doctor then closes the incision with staples.  In my case, the incision down the front was about two and a half inches long and used fourteen staples to keep it shut.  Four other staples were used in the small holes on the sides of the knee.  This procedure ran long and took three hours to complete.  From this stage, I was taken into the recovery room were I woke up for about an hour.  The next day, I was given a quick briefing on crutches and how to get around at home. This information was communicated to me by the occupational and physiotherapists.  I was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday March 2nd around 2:00 p.m.   urlLink    Preparing For Surgery.

Since the recovery time is so lengthy, you lose a lot of muscle mass in your leg.  On my discharge, my therapy began.  I had met with occupational and physiotherapists in the hospital.  My instructions were pressure, ice, elevation, and rest. (P.I.E.R.).  The goal in the first one to two weeks is mainly to minimize the swelling.  These four steps would be my "work out" for the two weeks I spent laying around the house. I wore a tensor everyday until the majority of the swelling was lost.  Icing the knee for fifteen minutes every two to four hours was also important to minimize the swelling.  Elevation and resting the knee was the most important in my opinion.  I spent two weeks sitting around the house elevating my knee above my heart for the majority of my days.  My first physiotherapy appointment was four days post-operation.  My physiotherapist, Diane Greenlay, was not able to further me on exercises according to the ACL protocol given to her from my doctor.  I was to work on getting full extension by laying my leg flat and applying pressure to the top.  An exercise to eliminate swelling, given by my physiotherapist, was to pump my ankles.   Stage one of the protocol, zero to ten days after the surgery, had goals to heal the scar, crutch walking, attain 0° to 90° range of motion, and begin to regain quadricep control.  I was instructed to continue to use P.I.E.R.  I was to concentrate on gaining my full range of motion, especially my extension so that my ligaments do not shorten.  A range of motion exercise was to sit on the end of a bed and softly swing my legs back and forth.  My range of motion was being restricted due to the swelling around the knee joint.  At about seven to ten days I was supposed to begin patellar and scar mobilization.  This "knee cap wiggling" was to pump out swelling, loosen up the patellar tendon, and prevent the skin where the scar was located from attaching, losing it's pliability.  I was permitted to crutch walk as tolerated to aid in gaining my extension in the joint and to help correct my posture.  Ten days to six weeks was stage two of the protocol.  The goals were to attain regular extension, 0° to 190°, increase general leg strength in quadriceps and hamstrings, ensure patella and scar mobility, and discontinue crutches at three to six weeks.  Two weeks after the surgery, I went to see my doctor.  I was sent to radiology where two x-rays were taken, medial and a skyline images.  I went to castings where the sixteen staples were removed from my knee.  Dr. Bering then looked at my x-rays and then my knee.  I asked him a few questions.  Diane Greenlay had found a lump located on my hamstring, which I asked Dr. Bering about.  He was not sure what this mass was, so he is booking me an appointment to get a magnetic resolution image (MRI) of it.  The exercises for stage two remained the same until six weeks post-op.  At this point, I was advanced to begin a light cardiovascular on an elliptical, stair climber, or stationary bicycle with low resistance.  Stage three occurs at six to twelve weeks after the surgery date.  This stages' goals are to continue increasing strength and endurance.  I am just beginning to enter this stage.  Exercises that increase your leg strength would be calf raises and leg squats.  Both of those can be reduced to single leg.  Endurance continues to use the  elliptical, stair climber, stationary bicycle, and swimming exercises.  Stage four is the longest recovery stage, twelve to twenty-four weeks.  Again, like the previous stages, increasing endurance and strength, but back to it's original state.  Endurance can be increased by light jogging in a straight line on a flat surface and cord running (forwards and backwards).  I am going to begin with jog then walk with one minute intervals.  Low impact aerobics are permitted.  Stage five is the final stage at twenty-four weeks on.  This stage allows the patient to continue with sports if the doctor permits.  The way my recovery has been proceeding, physiotherapist Greenlay said I will be able to play football in the fall with no problems.   	  urlLink    X-Ray   urlLink    The Final Product  	Tearing my ACL has been a life experience.  This surgery, if continues to be successful, will allow my life to continue on.  I will be very pleased and would recommend the surgery if I am able to play sports again.  Hopefully, in the future, I will look back on these days just as a memory of a 'bump in the road of life'.
