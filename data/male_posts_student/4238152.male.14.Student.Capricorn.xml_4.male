This unusual topic has been tackled by my fellow writer Eric and I’m here to present yet another case of border crisis. Take a bow Eric. The temporary classroom block if not good for nothing still serves a purpose – rattling the chipboard walls and see how long it’ll be before the partition drops. After all, the whole structure is  temporary  isn’t it? Perhaps more light should be shed on this issue of border crisis. As far as I know, it originated from Anderson, when students who sat near these partitions grew bored of the lesson (which is quite often, ands that’s saying something) they started throwing their weight against it. This caused the partition to rock violently and thereby disrupting the neighboring class’s lesson. It has proven to be great fun when one side bangs and the other returns the favor. And as humans evolved for the sake of evolution, so has the banging of these partitions. As in order with this year’s theme – magical, enterprising and wow, Andersonians have taken it to heart. A splendid example would be the mutilation of the partitions. Major Chong is a busy man but recent events have made him busier. You see, holes in these  so – called  walls are a  so – called  eyesore whereas in my opinion, makes the school look more like the  darker  side of LA. Indeed, such a scene is not appealing to everyone but  compromises  must be made right? So, instead of making holes in the wall, students have taken to removing the wall altogether. This in itself is magical – how often do you get to witness such a ceremony? Enterprising – if the school ever needs construction works to rebuild the school, here are some ideal ones. And wow – I mean, wow…literally; students are really getting the hand of multitasking aren’t they? Now, removing the wall isn’t too difficult. In fact, its part of the cause and effect cycle of banging it. The partition itself is only meant to allocate the space to each class and determine the class’s boundaries. Unlike bomb shelters, these walls are unable to withstand vigorous banging or rocking. And of course, when the glue (can you believe it? The school is so  enterprising . Temporary, really!) is torn apart from the wall, which has already began, the wall will have to fall due to an unstable equilibrium and gravitational forces. And being enterprising students, they must make the best of the fallen wall. So they’ll see which side has a disliked teacher/student and have the wall fall towards that direction. So far, there have been no incidents of such nature and I sincerely hope so since I’m sitting next to the wall but as a good student, I would now like to share some of there magical techniques on banging the wall, which will certainly make you, go “wow”.  Beginner’s guide to banging the wall  The good ‘ole way…  Simply ram your elbow  ala  a rugby tackle at the wall and marvel at Newton’s laws and the conservation of energy. Note, this method no matter how macho it makes you feels is ill – advised, as you will feel great discomfort in your elbow the following day.  Knock, knock, who’s there?  This method was developed by the normal stream of 2002 last year during reading sessions in the hall where they repeatedly slammed their reading materials on the floor much to the supervising teacher’s annoyance. This method has proven to be a hit among passive students who only want to make noise without having any fatalities. Like the normal stream have done, just take a hard object with a decent surface area of preferably 100cm2 and slam it against the wall repeatedly. Guaranteed satisfaction, which will make the DC, that follows more bearable. Last but not least…  The retainee’s method…  Yes, yes as a tribute to Ron who started this method, those who wish to follow suit needn’t worry about being retained; obviously, that requires more  skill . This method involves shouting vulgarities at the wall in the belief that sound travels through hard objects faster. Obviously, the nut head hasn’t been doing much reading up ( retained ?) otherwise he would have realized that the wall is make up of chipboard and sponge which doesn’t propagate sound but on the contrary absorbs it. Not to be defeated, there is a plan B. This involves throwing or banging (or a combination of both) either a basketball or chair at the wall. The result would be the students at the other side of the wall retaliate in kind or ask Mr. Ang to witness the event.  A few words of advise before I end this piece and proceed to fine tuning my methods of wall banging, one must realize that at the end of the day, the school is where you receive your education and not where you bang walls. Banging of walls or fellow students should preferably be done outside school.  Nofing has learnt his lesson and has stopped banging the wall. Unfortunately, those nut heads led by Ron on the other side of the wall have not learnt their lesson. He feels that those losers should go bang their heads against a wall or bang someone. She bangs, she bangs…
