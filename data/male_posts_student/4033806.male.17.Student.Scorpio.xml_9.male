Anyways, you know it as soon as you walk in the joint who they are, they could be sat there in silence yet somehow you know that, that 12 year old pregnant scally and her girlfriend mates are going to be noisy as hell. I say girls because it always is.      If you havent guessed what I'm on about yet its when your sat in a nice civilised place such as a restataunt or library, and there is a group of people (usually teenage girls) causing unessacery noise. I'd say that it was annoying but its more than that, annoying is when you go down for a midnight snack and theres nothing in that you fancy, or when your about to play a game online with your mate, but a thunderstorm starts and you havta turn your pc off. Not being able to talk over a civilised meal which im paying a good £40/£50 to make the missus feel special and theres a gang of retardo sluts all sitting round a table drinking bacardi breezers witha  bag of crisps because they can legally drink witha 'meal'. Making a load of racket and disturbing everyone else, I jsut fail to grasp what right they think they have.      You know whats even worse than that, when you walk into a place like subway, sit down and all is nice and then the group in question normally girls again says something uber loud, because they want you to hear, they dont want you to think that they are actually talking to them, but they want you to hear, example:       *We all much on our subways*   John: Yum   Jay: Yeah   Charli: *Burp*      Annoying Girl 1: WHAT YOU MEAN YOU FANCY THAT LAD WITH THE HAIR      {Now this is a typical scally wag statement, notice how its in caps to show it is shouted, and her friend is sat, oh i dunno 6 inches away?! also note that the description is about as precise as a potato trying to hit a target with a spoon from half a mile away, everyguy turns round, not because they actually want to be fancied, simply to give them a look that suggests almost certain death, anyway lets carry on with teh scenario..}      Annoying Girl 2: EEEWWWW NO I DON'T      {O.k. so she doesnt, no big loss, after all she looks like she fell from the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down, and shes pregnant with a 12 year olds kid, which was more than likely concieved in the bus stop across the road the month before after a heavy session of drinking cider and smoking lambert and butler. Anyways whether or not she actually fancied anyone or not, no one cares, all you hear from teh rest of teh people in subway is a sigh of relief!}      Annoying girl 1: YEAH YOU DO YOU JUST SAID YOU DO      {Like Hello? no one cares, just shut the fuck up, but the worst is yet to come}      *Annoying Girl 2 gets up and kind of stumbles over towards our table, if your lucky and its early in the day and the double vision hasnt set in from the cider yet, you may get eye contact, but i doubt it, cos lets face it, who eats subway that early?}      Annoying Girl 2: Will you snog me?!      {Now Hold up what?! You sut said you didnt fancy this dude with the hair, and even if you did you can go toss over donkey droppings for all i care because there is not a snowballs chance in hell that those cyphalis ridden lips are going anywhere near any part of my body, and to be honest im rather worried about you standing so close to me and my food just incase there is a rare form of STI that can jump on to me or my food because lets face it, this bitch gets around and it doesnt matter how rare it is, if it exists, this bitch has it.}      And so i conclude how annoying people can be in places where you just cant be doing with all the hassle, i mean sometimes it aint so bad if its on the street and your just wandering by, in that instance your only worry is that the 6ft butch bitch called Wanda isnt going to twat us for turning her down, you can always just carry on walkuing and ignore them, chances are after a few paces the alcopop will kick in and they will forget what they are doing and fall over, but in a public place where all you wanna do is sit down and have a good chat and a bite to eat its not on, there should be a fast food joint with a dress code or something to keep the scallywags out.. and you know... people wonder why im not keen on McDonalds.. Ha!
