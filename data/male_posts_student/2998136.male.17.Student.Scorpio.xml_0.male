Eating a balanced diet gives your body the raw material it needs to function at its peak, sexually and otherwise. Choosing healthful foods is good for your heart and, in turn, for your circulation, which benefits genital arousal, among other bodily functions. Try these sex-boosting snacks: Apricots have high levels of vitamin A and magnesium, which are reputed to contribute to fertility. Broccoli allegedly enhances sexual sensation because of its high vitamin A, C, B5 and niacin content. Potatoes contain vitamin B5, which is essential to sex hormone production.    Check out these sex-stimulating supplements:   Ginkgo biloba  optimizes sexual pleasure by relaxing muscles and increasing blood flow. Daily dose: 50 milligrams.  Ginseng  increases energy and stimulates sexual desire. Daily dose: 100 milligrams.  Kava kava  eases stress without the drowse-inducing side effects of sedatives. Daily dose: 60 milligrams.  Note: Consult your physician before taking any supplements.   Beware of these libido-stoppers.  Some prescription drugs, such as antidepressants, can interfere with sexual functioning. Talk to your doctor if you take medication on a regular basis, in particular, drugs such as antihypertensives, which can cause erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction in men as well as dampen desire in women; asthma meds, which can cause vaginal dryness; or birth-control pills, which can result in vaginal dryness and a lagging libido. Recreational drugs such as nicotine and alcohol -- and even caffeine -- can seriously compromise your sex life, especially when taken on a regular basis.    Arouse your senses every day.  Stimulating all of your senses with nonsexual massage, aromatic candles and even some fantasizing not only puts you in the mood for lovemaking, but can also rev up your physiology. Add these elements to your life, whether or not you have a partner.    Make exercise sexy.  Working out improves cardiovascular health, boosts energy, reduces stress and makes you feel good about yourself -- all of which can make you a better lover. Fitness fact: Exercise also triggers the release of endorphins, the same brain chemicals that are released when we fall in love.    Consider sleep essential.  It's easy to cut back on z's when life gets hectic. But the truth is, if you're not well rested, you won't have great sex. If you have trouble drifting off, avoid midday catnaps and caffeine pick-me-ups -- they interfere with your ability to establish a healthy snooze routine.    Banish stress from the bedroom.  Ironically, when we're stressed, we often don't make time for sex, despite the fact that sex is a great stress-reliever. Anxiety can decrease our ability to experience pleasure and can also shut down our libido, which is why it's important to integrate basic stress-reducing methods such as meditation, deep breathing, yoga or tai chi into your weekly routine.
