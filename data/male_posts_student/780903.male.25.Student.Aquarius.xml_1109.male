Personally I'm holding out for these toys:  Tickle-Me Rehnquist Teenage Mutant Ninja Souter TeleThomas Beanie Breyers Tony (Kennedy) Ruxpin Mr. Scalia Head G.I. Jo'Connor Gins-Burgers n' Fries McDonalds Play Set  And, of course, there's also everyone's favorite candies from the past --  ThurGood n' Plentys, Three MuskeTaft, and Milky (John) Jay
