I know, I know, you can't always do what you want, but this..it totally  sucks  and I simply hate it. If its art, which is supposed to be expressing yourself, then why can't you go and express yourself instead of messing around with this small piece of carpet and putting paint on it like a complete  retard.   Here comes the professional answer: "Well, the reason for you havig to mess about with some random stuff is that you have to "learn" art just like Picasso and the other geniuses like him, since of course, they "learned" art aswell, they went to proper art schools and did art as a subject, just like Michael Angelo. Before you start expressing yourself you have to learn how to do it!"   AAARGH! NO!  I HATE IT!   1.) You don't learn art, you know what you have to do, and how you have to do it, if they would 'teach art' then everyone's art would be the same 2.) Not every Artist went to real art school, I really doubt that  Who cares about analysing art?huh? does every artist sit down and 'PLAN' before they paint or draw? NO! So why do we have to do that? Does that make us more professional? Or is it only that we are students? Well, I'll tell you something; even now, after analysing many artists' works, I still draw/paint in the same way, and it hasn't changed anything on my style at all, that I know the elements of design.  GCSE art is a failiure  and it is that way because they try to teach every subject in the same way. analysing with history and maths is completely alright..but ART?! NO!    I mean, look at this, do I care about this? What the hell is this? I don't wan to analyse it! Jeeeez. Does analysing a naked woman with big breasts in a wheelchair with some random shapes make my view on art different? Well, I think that you should be focusing as much as you can on NOT changing how I look at the things I don't like, because I am I and you won't force your views on me.  This is crap . I can't feel anything when I look at it apart from being disgusted, I am sorry, maybe the person who created it felt something, but probably it wasn't anything more than a "Friday night out, and drinking too much". I am gonna leave this for now and go on. I still need to do my art hw, and collect some lino prints.    I am listening to a Hungarian rap song, one of my all-time-favourites, wow it sounds so good, but what matters is not the rythm, but what it says. And what it says it very true indeed..."There's no way out, you are staying down in the dirt, no one helps you here, there is nothing left but burlgary and theft, but if you get caught, then that totally sucks!"...Doesn't make much sense in englsih does it? heh
