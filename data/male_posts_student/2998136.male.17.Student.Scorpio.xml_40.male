The writer approach the issue using logic, bible verses and people's experiences. What he wrote makes senses and he uses a religous method to somehow psycho the people as in brain-washing. Hopefully, his ultimate goal is to see the gay population in Singapore would decrease.  Blog's URL:  urlLink http://stopgays.blogspot.com/  Rating: 4 and a half out of 5 Stars
