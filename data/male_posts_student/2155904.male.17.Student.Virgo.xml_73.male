He got up a little before 10 and got his pelo trimmed.  He still doesn't exactly understand why he and his family go to this guy in Bellevue for a haircut when Tyke's hair, at least, would be quite easy to cut on their own.  Not to mention the fact that it would save money and also the guy doesn't do a great job either but he is a cool guy.  It don't matter in the end.  All that matters is what Tyke writes in his blog really.  He got back home and talked to Amed "no longer" Annoying a little bit online but he was the only one on so he is all Tyke talked to.  Tyke watched some football and there were some real good plays and that was just boding well for the rest of his day.  He then got in the shower naked and cleaned himself up and then dried off his naked body.  Then he un-nakeded himself by putting on his clothes for "work."  Ha!  So not work but whatever it might end up being his job in a few months.   He got some MickeyD's on the way and he had a little lapse in his driving skills while in the drive-thru and nearly drilled the car in front of him.  But he didn't and the driver didn't even notice.  Hehe.  So then he drank his monster shake and was off.  He got to KING 5 at about 3:30 and right away he was put to work.  Actually that is a lie.  He just went and sat at this computer and watched some games and stuff while waiting to be asked to do something.  Then came the 5:30 show and he just went into the control room for this one.  He watched it from there with the headphones on and all.  Seeing some behind-the-scenes action even though he really has seen everything at least once by this point.  Then they went back to their place of work and did some more prep before the 6:30 show and then he went down to the studio for that one and stayed around for the teasers they do for later shows and the Sonics halftime update on KONG.  Then he went back upstairs and once the Sonics game started he actually got to do some work.  Which he was looking forward to do.  He logged the game, which for those of you who either don't know or remember simply means that he takes down plays and times of happenings in the game.  Taking notes and stuff all the while.  This was actually important again for Michael King (the shadowed sports anchor) as with all of the games going on at the moment there was no way he could really devote much time to all of the ones he should be watching.  So having Tyke there meant they could get great stuff from that game as well as get the best of the rest.  So Tyke did that and it went into OT so it was even more work.  Then Tyke picked out his highlights and told Michael all the important plays and scores which helped him write his script for that part.  Then Tyke was basically done other than checking factoids and such for Michael.  Tyke has an awesome memory and knowledge of sports so he is good to have around.  And now KING knows this.  In fact, Tyke was pretty much offered an internship by King.  So that means that although he won't get paid it will be incredible experience and also give him some superb connections.  Oh and by pretty much Tyke means that he was told that when he is in college or whatever he should come by and be an intern.  So it was one of those light-hearted truthful offers.  Which means he should be able to stay around at KING for the summer.  That would be awesome.  However, he still isn't positive on it.  But if he did he might be able to go to Safeco and those places along with getting to work on stuff.  He really does know how to do everything so far he has seen Michael do.  Like he could pretty much do his job if he needed.  And that is pretty cool to think about.  Like totally awesome actually.  Just think about it, "Tyke Turner is coming live to you from Safeco Field where your Seattle Mariners have just captured the AL West crown and are on the path to a Fall Classic trip.  More at 11."  See, he already knows what to do and the technology is easy to use too.  Not to mention that the people at KING seem to like him.  Well he finally left at about 11 so he racked up 8 more hours.  He now has done 20 overall.  And that is in like 4, maybe 5 trips.  4 he thinks though.  Ahh yes, now for what you have all been waiting for.  Tyke Turner's miscellaneous tidbits of information.  Well last night Tyke had a nice little bit of a dream.  All he really remembers is that this one part was awesome.  Any guesses as to why it was awesome?  Yeah, you prolly can sorta guess it.  Tyke really only remembers the small portion where he was kissing Tina.  And by kissing he means making out.  And by making out he means making out, nothing more.  HA!  Gotchya with that one didn't he?  Maybe not, and if not then it was probably stupid.  So ignore it.  But yeah, they were kissing and caressing and such.  What a lovely time that was.  If only it were true...BUT it ain't so no need to spend time dwelling on what could be or hoping for something that is not going to happen.  No matter Tina's availability, her and Tyke are not going to hook up.  Tyke has totally accepted this as fact and for those of you who tell him that she might change, thanks but it won't.  And the last thing Tyke needs right now is to be trying to hold onto something that isn't there.  But since Tyke doesn't want himself thinking about how great it would be for him and Tina to be together he will leave that up to you, his adoring friends.  So just think about it all the time.  And maybe even write stories about it.  If someone wrote a story about it then Tyke would definitely read it.  All is well in Tyke-land.  How are things in you-land?
