But just so you know Tyke wrote everything you will read for a while in a journal so that is what you will be reading now:  So yes, Tyke is back for another blog.  He has had enough adventures for today that he really doesn't want to have the rest of the trip like this one.  But enough with the prepping, let's get to the nitty gritty.  Tyke ended up going to bed at about 3 AM on Monday night (???) no, no, Tuesday night/Wed morning.  He woke up at 7:40 to finish getting himself ready for the trip.  He had written a few emails already last night so he was done saying goodbye to people.  He did finish everything up though and ate some of a breakfast before the entire fam was finally ready to leave.  THey left Tyke's house at 9 AM and were picked up by a family friend.  They got to the airport and there was quite a long line to check in at Air Canada.  After they did check in they went through security for the first of many times.  They got to the gate and had sometime to kill before departing so Tyke got a Tazo tea from Starbucks (it was gross) and then he walked around and got some Pringles and a hat from Wazzu.  The first flight left Seattle at about 12 PM and arrived in Toronto at about 6:50 PM EDT.  The flight wasn't all that bad.  The movie was Starsky and Hutch and Tyke had a chicken dinner.  He looked at his can of Pringles mid-flight and saw they had changed to being full to the top of the can because of the change in air pressure.  It was pretty cool.  Right now Tyke is writing down everything while sitting back in his first cottage in Tingewick.  It's an interesting little house.  It's quite quaint.  But Tyke definitely can't get ahead of himself.  The arrival to Toronto was met with an onslaught of activity in the airport.  They had to switch flights in order to get to London but the new flight was in a different terminal.  They had to quickly get through security and to the new terminal.  They had some confusion about whether or not they had to claim their baggage but they were told they didn't need to.  Damn though...Tyke is just so incredibly tired right now.  It is 7:40 AM in Washington and Tyke has had less than 2 hours of sleep for the last 24 hours.  Less than 7 hours in the last 48 and less than 13 hours in the last 72.  Tyke is a tired traveler.  But he better get used to it soon or else.  Back to the story.  The family went through Toronto's airport before they had to get on an airport shuttle that took them closer to their destination.  But they had to take a 2nd shuttle and this one took them on the runway!!!!  It was quite a convoluted mess but they made it to their next flight in time.  The next flight was a long one.  Not the longest of the trip though.  From Toronto they departed for the 6 and a half hour flight to London's Heathrow Airport.  The flight wasn't too bad but Tyke started to get a sore throat (more on that later).  They arrived at about 8:30 and went through a long customs line before going to pick up their baggage.  Here's where it all snowballed.  They stood around the baggage claim waiting for their luggage.  They stood, and stood, and stood, and yes, stood.  They waited with a lot of other people only to find their baggage wasn't coming.  So they got in a different line and filled out some paperworke where the luggage could be sent to when it arrived.  Tyke saw a very very fine looking girl waiting in line.  But they ended up leaving the airport without their luggage.  Then they had to find a way home.  They went on a long walk to the bus terminal only to find they would have to wait 3 hours for a bus that cost 140£ (280 bucks approx).  Then they walked all the way back to the airport to find a train to start them on their way.  They took a train.  The next train was longer and they got off that in Milton Keynes.  Once in Milton Keynes they went outside to find that they weren't in the right spot for their rental car.   So they got back on the train and got off on the next stop.  Here they walked outside to an Enterprise car agency where they asked for help in retrieiving their car.  They found a really nice guy who went out of his way to drive them to the other rental car agency which would have been about a 40 minute walk.  THey got to the agency and got their car, a Saab 9 3.  It's a nice car and has tiptronics.  Needless to  say, Tyke was a little bit tired by this point.  Then they got in the car for another adventure.  Of course the steering wheel is on the right side and you drive on the left side.  Oh, and there are about 30 million roundabouts.  Every 45 seconds you run into a roundabout and they are tricky devils at first.  Tyke's dad kept drifting off the side of the road too cuz the streets are narrow.  They finally got to their house though and it's a nice little cottage with 3 floors (Tyke videotaped it so you can see it) but by this time Tyke was dead.  Once their bags finally arrived they got dinner at BK (they're everywhere here) and then some groceries.  Then Tyke came home and went right to bed.  The next morning Tyke woke up and felt like shit.  His throat hurt, his body was sore, and he just felt crappy.  His dad was sick too so he stayed home but Tyke decided to go out with his bro and mom.  They went to Warwick Castle which is really cool and they stayed there for a while.  Tyke felt bad for a while but they stayed until they decided they wanted food.  They got lunch and some things for Tyke before finally heading home.  Once they got home, Tyke went straight to bed (3 PM) and got up the next morning.  Oh yeah, the first night Tyke slept for 14 hours.  On Saturday morning Tyke got up and his right ear was throbbing with pain and he couldn't hear out of it very well.  His throat hurt a little bit too.  After some talking, they took Tyke to the "hospital" and got him looked at.  Of course it was weird cuz Tyke wasn't English but the Dr. still saw him.  He looked in his right ear and right away said "there's a nasty infection."  Tyke hasn't had an ear infection since he was like 5.  So he was prescribed some amoxycillin and then sent home.  Tyke has to take 3 capsules a day for 5 days.  So far he's taken 4 caps.  He came home on Saturday while the rest of his family did a few things that ended up sucking anyway.  Stratford=Disneyland without the fun.  But Tyke picked up the Da Vinci code and read that for most of the day.  He read 38 chapters in all and the book is really quite good.  He also watched some boring British TV but OC and Dawson's Creek were on too.  Other than that Tyke hasn't done anything and today his mom and bro went to some museums while Tyke stayed home.  It is only Sunday and Tyke has felt pretty homesick at times.  The weather has been cloudy at times with occasional rain but not all that bad.  However, back home it was supposed to be hot.  Just so you know Tyke is thinking about you guys a lot.  Especially when he is couped up in bed.  He can't wait until he can enjoy his trip and stop feeling homesick but he's really looking forward to July 5th.  Cheers mate!  Tyke out... Here is the briefing for Tyke's events on Sunday.  He woke up and of course his ear hurt so stayed home doing nothing.  This is becoming the same old story for Tyke's trip.  He already mentioned earlier what his mom and bro did so he'll tell you what Tyke did.  He grabbed the Da Vinci Code and read all of it in his bed upstairs cuz it smells nice.  He read 270 pages today.  All of the 454 page book was finished then.  2 days of really good reading for him which is why he wanted to do it.  But basically all Tyke has done is read, go to the bathroom, eat Doritos, drink, and then sit in his bed listening to the noises in his ear and the tick of the clock.  The ear noise is like he is at a freeway on a windy day with cars whizzing by, just it is toned down a lot and only coming from his right ear.  His right ear hurts, his right nostril is plugged, and the right side of his throat is sore.  Well Tyke pulled out some senior pics for a while to look at and it reminded him of home but he is anxiously awaiting his next amoxycillin dose hoping it improves his condition.  Man this sucks hardcore. Tomorrow Tyke might finally be able to post these writings Tyke keeps in a journal.  Let's hope.  Hold on...Tyke's trying to swat a fly...Ok done.  Well today was a change from yesterday.  In the morning Tyke woke up and felt a little better, his ear didn't hurt but he had a very very stuffed nose.  He decided he would do they day's activities, though.  There was this really old cathedral in Salisbury and England is cool just because it has history, really.  There were some great shops too.  Tyke has liked English clothing so far and he got a shirt and some jeans but passed on some cool 12 £ shoes cuz he already has so many pairs of shoe for a guy.  He still felt crappy the whole day but he fought through it.  They went to Subway for lunch and then drove on.  They couldn't get a great sight of Stonehenge cuz it was closed cuz of summer solstice celebrations.  The pictures are misleading.  It's right by a road and, well it's just not the same as the pics.  It's still cool.  They also saw Old Sarum which is the remnants of an old castle.  THat was alright.  On the way back they did some more shopping.  Then they came home to watch England beat Croatia at football.  And now Tyke is going to sleep.  Best wishes.  Love ya'll! Damn, yet another day passes and Tyke still hasn't recovered.  Last night Tyke's left ear began to howl in pain.  It was a constant throb that was oh so very painful.  He took some asprin and that eventually quelled the pain but he still lost quite a bit of sleep because the pain was so fierce.  In the morning his left ear was still plugged like his right and his nose and throat were still sore.  So in the morning he went back to the doctor's and saw a new doctor.  The infection in the rigth ear has died down but the left ear started up.  So the doc gave Tyke some tips and set him up with a new prescription.  Erythromycin is the name.  This stuff better actually work or else Tyke might be sent home to the U.S.  When his family moves on to Scotland.  So yeah that's pretty big news.  Some more news is that there is a rail-worker strike starting on the day Tyke leaves for Edinburgh on train.  THey should be able to use the train before the strike hurts but they'll have to wait and see.  This is really quite the eventful trip.  Everything seems to be going wrong.  But Tyke did pick up two books today.  Angels and Demons-prequel to Da Vinci Code-and Deception Point-by same author as other two books.  So at least Tyke has something to do now.  But still, he's been sick everyday since last Wednesday.  This is incredible.  Yet another update on Tyke's progress.  Last night he watched some football, read, and got a facial.  Well sort of.  Tyke got a steaming pot of boiling water, put his face over it, and put a towel over his head to keep him enclosed.  It was basically a humidifier but it also had the bonus of giving Tyke a facial.  It sorta helped Tyke.  It didn't really clear anything out but it made him feel better.  Then he took his meds and went to bed.  He woke up the next morning (it's now Wednesday) and his cars were still plugged but now his throat was more phlegmy than his nose.  He still didn't feel good enough to go to London though so his bro went alone while his mom went to Blenheim Palace later on.  His dad, too, is still somewhat sick as well so his family is reeling.  Oh yeah and the rail strike next Tuesday meant that Tyke's mom couldn't book a train back from Edinburgh yet so that's not good.  But if Tyke doesn't get any better he might be flying home.  And also, the rain has come in and the next time sunny days might appear would be in France.  About 10 days away.  The fun just won't stop, will it???  Tonight Tyke is scheduled for another humidifier and then going to an internet cafe in Buckingham where he can actually blog this.  So hopefully that will happen.  Tyke's right ear might be starting to clear out now though which is a good sign.  And Tyke finished Angels and Demons today too.  600 more pages read.  That's 1000+ read so far.  Tyke's a reading machine.  That's all for now...Europe's been interesting so say the least.  Ok, so that was that.  Right now Tyke is in a hurry so he has to finish up.  But just know that you are all being missed but hopefully Tyke can start feeling better.  Just pray for him.  Cuz yeah, Tyke's taken a startling new interest in religion.  The study of mainly but spiritual questions are coming up now too.  Amed, aren't you excited!!
