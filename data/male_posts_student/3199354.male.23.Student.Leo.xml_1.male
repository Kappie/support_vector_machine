Or logged my conversation with him? You have got to be the dumbest person I've ever met.  Who's hair is like straw and always falling out, stare is like she's dim-witted, humor is tiring and only appreciated by those that are humoring her, tits are 2 different sizes, ass is always out of shape and stinks, shits on people's floors when she's drunk, is an off-and-on junkie, has a thing for her brother, has a psycho sister, an ugly boyfriend, and can't accomplish anything for herself while she expects everyone around her to? Hmm...let's see... Feeling pretty good right now.   Realized that younger skate punks are almost all assholes. Seems like most people around here think that's all you can be. I also hate the SUV/Escalade crowd, who came into money by no hard-working means and park wherever the fuck they want to, regardless of the fact that they're almost causing several accidents. I understand how terrorism is so abundant in the world these days. People are bringing this shit on themselves.
