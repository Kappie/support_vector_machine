I've been stuck at home all day playing around with HTML instead of catching up on homework which i should be doing. Stupid Bennet (I've noticed i bitch about him a lot) has finally set us a date to hand in the willmill assignment and it's this friday which is crap because that means i'm actually going to have to do some work in DT *sigh* School this week will be a bludge. Storm the Castle tomorrow. Don't know why everyone's bagging it. Put it this way, the less people turn up the more TV's, MP3's (in desperate need of one since i accidentally smashed the remote of my old one) and Hi Fi systems (broke that one trying to fix the cd drive) for me. So very bored.
