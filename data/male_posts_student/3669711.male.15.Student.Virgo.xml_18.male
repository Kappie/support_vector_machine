What are problems?  Again, i turn to my trusted friend, dictionary.com.  The dictionary deffinition of problems is:    probÂ·lem  2.  A situation, matter, or person that presents perplexity or difficulty:  was having problems breathing; considered the main problem to be his boss.   3.   A misgiving, objection, or complaint:  I have a problem with his cynicism.      Problems are situations that are caused by misgivings, objections, or complaints that presents a person with difficulty   . Ok, so that question is answered, and also what causes problems is answered.       Now, the question is who causes problems.  I guess we all do, once in a while.  Your mom asks you to make your bed, but it doesn't get done.  You have a little argument.  Theres a problem.  You boss orders you to get something photocopied, but you forget. Another little argument. Another problem.  Those are only a few examples of how problems can be caused.  Some people might even have a problem with you.     So, what can solve these problems?  There's a different method for each individual problem, just as every problem is unique.  Like you can't fix your marriage with a screwdriver like you would fix the kitchen sink.    Now, for the real question, can one person cause all problems?  No, that would be impossible.  It would be like blaming a baby for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.  That lesson is for you Gwen, if you're reading this!  Lol.     Problems will always be caused as long as humans are around.  We make mistakes, they turn into problems.  As long as you know you don't cause all of them, you'll be fine.    Lates
