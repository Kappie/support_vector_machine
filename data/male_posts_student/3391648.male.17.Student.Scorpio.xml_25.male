The OFLC is a disgusting censorship institution which the m3r club is as of today launching a campaign against.  With their ruling of an M rating for this film they have proven ther irrelevancy to the people of Australia. When the age newspaper asked parents if they had any concern about taking their children to an M rated film, many parents said they didnt even know about the rating and others couldn't give a shit. This film is a childrens film and a fine one at that. Pretty much as soon as this M rating was announced the distibutors here in Australia applied to have it overturned and instead of sticking to their guns the OFLC have bowed to pressure. The OFLC is also heavily influenced by right wing censorship groups. Having given the film 'Irreversible' an R rating they're now going back after some prudes who want it banned have complained. The hearing will be held in Late June. You may remember further ridiculous acts by the OFLC including re rating Hannibal as an R after complaints while it was already showing in Cinemas. Many people between the ages of 15 and 18 having already have seen the film making the re-rating a complete farce, See Also the banning of Ken Park and the Banning of Baise Moi.
