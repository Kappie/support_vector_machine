I dun know the real reason why i am listening to that song so much. It's like... it puts me into a solemn mood. i believe it's a sad song yah... but somehow i feel calm about it.. it's like i actually enjoying dwelling in that sort of mood. it's like slipping into a comfort zone and not wanting to get out of it. I feel like i'm shutting myself beneath in the shell (i.e car) and live in my world. At the same time, i began to ask myself... why didn't i have more frens in uni? i do know ppl yet they aren't exactly frens... more like uni-mates. conversation topic resolves around school and that's pretty much about it. Sometimes i wish there are more to it but it's not easy to build up a frenship eh. Considering the fact that we only see each other 2-3 times a week. I can't envy some of them whom know loads of ppl, from different nationalities, different culture. It's so ironic, i mean, the thing about me coming to Oz was to get to know more ppl... yet somehow, i dun see it happening. Maybe it's me that's not putting the efforts in getting to know ppl or i can simply blame it on fate. *HA!* It's so farking ironic eh that here i am talking abt me enjoying the time being alone, feeling depressed and complaining about not enuff frens.   I caught Last samurai last nite. I thoroughly enjoyed it even tho it was rather predictable. It made me forgot abt my crappy lab test which i did in the afternoon. shan't talk about that. There were loads of ppl at the theatre and i bumped into this gal whom i think i've seen that day at the post office. I wasn't exactly sure but i have a feeling she is. i was looking at her for a while and perhaps, too long... coz she 'caught' me looking at her. oops. Well, that was about all which was interesting. Then it was time for home.   my hopes of getting PR here in Oz seems to be fading. doesn't look like it's gonna work out since a lot of factors are against me. Sigh. I realllly wanna stay here for a few years. i do not want it to become a history where i can only look back. i want it to be present. i.e me, staying here. i am dreading the day my visa expires... the image of me packing up, with my airtix, all ready to go home is rather disturbing. I mean, not that i ignoring my home or folks back in SG but somehow there are so much more to offer here and i want to experience it all before i m ready to go back.
