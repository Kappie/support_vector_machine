Since Guthrie started limiting the number of people allowed to attend Socrates' Cafe, not everyone can go.  Which super-sucks.  So I was thinking that maybe if we started an INTERNET Socrates' Cafe, more people could join and we could have a more interesting, philosophical time on the internet!  So I propose a Socrates' Cafe CHATROOM!  Who's with me?!  Oh, and, Michael, that date is my mommy's birthday!  Just fyi!  Whats the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?
