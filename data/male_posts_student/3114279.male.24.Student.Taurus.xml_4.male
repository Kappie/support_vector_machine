      Yo yo yo. We shot some scenes for my awful movie this weekend. Turned out really damn funny. Got reminded constantly that I am a bad director and actor, but that's how it is. It's just for fun. Also saw Kill Bill Vol. 2. Fucking awesome movie, no matter what my friend Ryan may say. I can't let forth any details, because certain people who also write in this blog haven't even seen vol. 1 yet. And they rhyme with ick. And start with an N. Senators tied their series. Go, O-town.
