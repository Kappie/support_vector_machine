OLD, DECAYED, TWO-WEEKS-PAST-EXPIRATION-DATE CHEESEWHIZ. but hulk rage. smash. kill. was cool. o yea, you kno society's going down the gutter when parents smoke with their children.  after that, i showed off a rubik's cube to farand, who said, "back in my day, we couldn't afford luxuries like rubix cube. we had playing cards, and matches, and the only thing cheap enough for us to do was to light random objects on fire and laugh maniacally as they burned ants to so many pieces of mush." ok so i made that up. i'm also going to la late july, to attend my mom's second wedding. since my mom's the youngest in her family, we were joking how her siblings were protecting her: "no, you cant marry him, he has a twitch in his eye! all you'll do for the rest of your life is stay home and cook for us!" then farand was like, "time passes by fast. i'm just so old now..." and then i said, "yea, the hours run through our fingers like so much sand in an hourglass." "o really now? has someone been watching soap operas?" "ahh, soap operas...just like so much better on toast."   cousins are the best.
