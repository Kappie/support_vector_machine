Steady loh~ I just have so so so much queries about this blog thingy man. Can some genius enlighten me or help me do the whole thing(I don want the mentor to puke blood u noe).... ARH! SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME!  Was having my sweet dream when Serene woke me up(TMD), she asked me out to play pool when she usually will reject my offer? Miracle! Haha. She must be trying to use that damn old trick, trying to keep herself occupied so that she will not think abt HE-WHO-SHALL-NOT-BE-NAMED. That trick didn't work for her though. I caught her staring into the air as if her soul has leave her body. Must be thinking of him when she was watching us playing pool.  After the rounds and rounds of pools, we went over to Parkway Parade to eat ice cream from Siok ling's place of work. I ate 3 ice-creams and 2 large packets of fries within an hour. Man I will put on weight again if I continue doing so! After that, we tried to help Serene chose her hair dye but she still cant settle on brown or red for her hair. I need a new hair colour and hair cut too. My hair is quite long for me now and I can already see the black black portion. There is so many things I want to do but I'm now not leave with a lot of time. I want to repaint, re-deco my room, do down to Ikea to chose the table and sofar bed, buy a new stationary case and new set of stationary last but not least to get some new clothes. So many things to do yet so little time. Hiaz
