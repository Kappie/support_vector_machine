I am willing to bet that more people will vote for milk. vote milk  screw you run on sentences, i would make fun of inability to spell. and my run on sentences are to protest for change in puntuation  The offical votes will be counted on the 15th so get out there and vote. tommorow is the last day until it is offical.  so as the 15th has come and gone i can offically say that micheal kerr's new nickname is now milk by a vote of:  milk has 4 votes miker has 0 votes
