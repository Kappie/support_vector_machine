Speaking of which I am somewhat surprised that I actually found it to be not as terrible a paper that I thought it would be. As I walked out of the exam room, I had this uneasy feeling that I must have done something wrong, because it just didn’t register to my mind and fit what I expected it to be.  I have had this sensation before, but never this profound before. Once again I’m reminded of how much someone upstairs must like me. Once again it’s not by my strength but by His. I should never forget this one fact.  So now it’s on to a well deserved break. Will be looking to updating here more often. Got lots of thoughts I should be putting up here. If I can remember them all that is.
