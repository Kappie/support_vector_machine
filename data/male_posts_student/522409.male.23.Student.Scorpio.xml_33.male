There's this girl whose blog I read, and it's so filled with passion and depression (y'know, she was just saying the same thing about someone else's livejournal, which is why I think this risks sounding tacky)... and it's painful to read.  Painful in that really helpless, cathartic sort of way.  It reminds me of all the angst I've been through over girls, just praying that the right one would finally come and find herself on the same page as me when she does.  But hers reaches a new level that I haven't had the chance to reach... this connection associated with a real relationship, and then having to say goodbye to someone for an undetermined amount of time.  I don't know how I'd do it, but I suppose first thing's first--finding that relationship.  She's also been through a very similar situation to me, and has similar regrets regarding it.  Only she was one of the participants in the relationship that was subsequently destroyed, and I was "the other guy."  I consider that moment my greatest regret.  My greatest failure of character.  My greatest disgrace.  And there's not a day that I don't think about it and wish I could take back the pain I caused.    On to something else that's been troubling me.  What politics does to people.  And there's something deeper that troubles me about it.  And by deeper, I also mean harder to explain.  Bear with me as I try.  So there are Republicans, there are Democrats, and there are a bajillion other "third parties."  For now, I'm going to stick to Reps and Dems, but I will say that I think some third parties have valid points to make.  Here's the problem from my standpoint.  Democrats in this country are vicious.  And they teach young democrats to be vicious, and hence, completely disrespectful of other views.  And that's the hypocritical thing about them... they say that Republicans aren't accepting.  They say they're all about inclusiveness, but it turns out that they only accept you if you share their point of view.  Which to even the dumbest person on earth smacks of hypocrisy of the highest and most shameless degree.  Intolerance?  Democrats are the kings and queens.  And they're conniving and manipulative, too.  They prey on emotions.  They prey on minorities.  They've got the minorities of this country convinced that Democrats are their saviors.  But what have the Democrats done for minorities?  Nothing.  Who made the big push to end slavery?  Republicans.  Who made the big Civil Rights bill push?  Republicans.  Who forced reform to the oppressive and destructive welfare system on minority-savior President Clinton at the risk of his re-election?  Republicans.  And have democrats elevated minorities to high office?  Not high enough.  Clarence Thomas and Antony Scalia are justices in the highest court in the land.  They're conservatives appointed by conservatives.  Colin Powell is Secretary of State, and Condolezza Rice is the most powerful voice on our National Security team.  Appointed by a conservative.  And the important thing to note here is that it wasn't BECAUSE of their race... it was because they were, hands down, the most QUALIFIED people to do those jobs.  That's another difference between the two parties.  Republicans seek a colorblind society.  Democrats seek a striated, color/gender/creed-aware society which rewards and punishes based on those categories.  They'll tell you otherwise.  They'll tell you that people are inherently racist/sexist/credist/elitist, and that in order to guard against the evil nature of these people, we need quotas, and entitlements and regulations on the books that "protect" minorities from discrimination.  The suggestion is as ridiculous as any of their claims, but perhaps is the most destructive of them all.    Anyway, as part of this elitism democrats subscribe to and pretend to abhor, they make a habit of berating conservatives for their beliefs.  Being a Republican is like a running gag with these people.  There's a huge stigma.  And there's a reason so many people subscribe to that mode of thought- it's easy.  It doesn't take any effort.  It doesn't take any courage at all to be a democrat.  You wanna be a radical on your college campus?  Don't be a druggie, a punk, a hippie, an anything else.  Try being a Republican.  That's where real courage lies.  It actually takes thought to be a republican.  It takes willingness to research issues and an ability to look beyond rhetoric and emotions and into the heart of issues.  It takes the ability to realize that emotions don't make effective policy, intelligence does.  Pragmaticism makes effective policy.  Tax cuts give more money back to people to invest in the national economy.  Small government allows people individual liberty.  National defense is crucial, and underspending on it leaves us vulnerable.  Welfare and affirmative action are demeaning and serve only to perpetuate people's circumstances.  The rich aren't evil.  They use their money to create companies which create jobs.  Denying that is ignorant and counterproductive.  The democrats have tried to turn this country against itself in terms of class warfare, and it's really an abysmal situation.  Jobs don't materialize out of thin air.  They are created, and not by the government.  They're created by the private sector.  So there's a choice here, and it's a hard one for dems to swallow, because it goes against everything they've been fed:  a) you can give money back to wealthy businesspeople so that they can invest in companies and create jobs, or b) you can take that businessperson's money from him in the form of higher taxes and give it out in the form of welfare.  One of those helps people reach their American Dream, one leaves their life a living hell.  (for those who would seek to evade this conclusion the correct answer is A equals American Dream, B equals Hell.)  And one thing I want to say to people in America who may be doubting the wisdom of a military strike on Iraq.  If we listened to the pacifists in the 1770's, we'd still be a British Colony. If we listened to the pacifists in the 1860's, slavery may still be alive in America. If we listened to the pacifists in the 1940's, Nazi Germany could have infected the whole of Europe and Asia. We learn now that the North Vietnamese were on the verge of pulling out of South Vietnam in 1968, but they decided to keep moving because they knew that the US was fighting dissent back home, and assumed that we'd cave.  They were right, and tens of thousands of soliders paid with their lives. If we listened to the pacifists in the early 90's, oil and gas prices could be triple what they are now.  Pacifists in this country are convinced that no one ever has to fight for freedom.  Now more than ever, the amount of freedom we enjoy here is the bete noire of tyrranical despots the world around.  Freedom is worth fighting for and it MUST be fought for.  Thomas Jefferson, who had to argue defiantly in the face of those 18th century pacifists, warned us, "The tree of liberty must from time to time be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants."  He wasn't endorsing war for the sake of war.  He was acknowledging the reality of the righteousness of our country's purpose, and the hatred it would inspire from other nations and other leaders who fear the rule of individual people.   That's all for now.  I want to change the world, and I want to make them conservative, because the democrats as a political machine have been wrong on every major policy decision since the Great Society, which itself went a bit overboard.  Their track record is awful, yet they continue to gain support through devious political strategy.  Vote tomorrow, and vote Republican.  The Democrats are destructive and irreverent, and have no bloody clue how to run a country, state, grocery store, or anything else.
