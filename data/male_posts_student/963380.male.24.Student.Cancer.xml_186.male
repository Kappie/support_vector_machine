It's the 4th of May.... Get it? May the 4th be with you? In any case, when this picture was taken I was in the process of getting the preliminaries of a burn. About an hour later I dropped 50$ US on a leather Indiana Jones hat that I simply had to have. I love that hat. I don't wear it, cause I look rediculous in hats, but it's still a source of pride for me. Say.... doesn't that guy look a little short for a storm trooper?  urlLink     urlLink
