I am rather traumatised and do not wish to discuss further for fear of relapse.  Me an Jo are going for a midnight skate hopefully. If i can be arsed moving by then. I may not be able to for a fact. Greediness has overcome my tired, withered little body. Much like a shrimp eating lost of stuff. What's that thing shrimp eat? ermmm You know it...  I wish everyone I know all moved to Durham too. it would be good then. Not shit. Shit like it is now. Varga played well at the gig, as did rosie and andrew. Micky and kris did crap, coz they bitched and acted like it was a competition. I don't like them. they smell. Much like cabbage that is.
