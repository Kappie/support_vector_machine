Every week, Bunnie "reviews" one of the top 20 CCM songs, and proceeds to bash it indiscriminately.  She has thus far bashed  More  (Matthew West),  Glory Defined  (Building 429),  Dare You To Move  (Switchfoot),  Who Am I  (Casting Crowns),  Instead  (Stacie Orrico),  Grace Like Rain  (Todd Agnew), and  Ready to Fly  (FFH).  The only song that Bunnie gave a passing grade to was  Sea of Faces , by Kutless.  You see, that song mentions the sacraments, and therefore it is Christian.   Who Am I , however, had too many cliches for Bunnie.  Sheesh.  Bunnie has also posted screeds against P, or Praise and Worship music.  Apparently she believes it to be uncreative, and finds the old hymns to be far more worshipful.  For some reason, she seems to believe that God does not deserve even the amount of praise that we give our favorite football player when he scores a touchdown.  Bunnie believes that we must be solemn (she must have missed the story in the Bible about David's dancing before God).    Maybe Bunnie needs to read  urlLink this article . Julie Anne Fidler shares her views on the Praise and Worship movement, and is nice about it.  She also challenges those of us who bear grudges against old hymns to "reevaluate your stance on what is worship..."  After all, worship is not in the music, but in the heart of the worshipper.  Thanks to  urlLink Sara  for the heads up on  urlLink CMCentral .
