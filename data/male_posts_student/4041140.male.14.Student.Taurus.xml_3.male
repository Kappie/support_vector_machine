The artifact known only as "The key of life" was created by the Ancients, unfortunately they were murdererd by a group of rebels called the "Reclaimers", little is known about the Reclaimers apart from that they won't stop at anything until they gain control over ::world name soon::. After the Ancients were murdered the Reclaimers vanished from our world. It is now five thousand years and our world has changed from a utopia of gardens and waterfalls to dangerous mountains and seas filled with giant octopusses.It is now that the king ::The king is either a player who's signed up or one of the creators of the game:: has created an army of warriors, these warriors will search for the Reclaimers and take the key of life from them. But when they figure out the immense power of the key will they bring it back to the king or will they fight for it and take the power that they fought for to the king and kill him?. The story is unfolding either be a commen peasant or be the warrior and search for the key to make the decision!    So joe what ya think?. Post a comment or something.
