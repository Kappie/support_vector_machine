Their latest offering, the G4 (wow - this is their FAST chip) 12" iBook is $1349.00 with the student discount.  I'm now trying to decide whether I want to spend my gift certificate on an iPod or if I should wait and get the iBook or if I should spend the GC's on the iPod and slowly save til I can afford an iBook - or better yet, the 12" Titanium Powerbook.   Now I'm sure there are those of you out there who are wondering precisely why I would want or need another computing device. It's fairly clear that this one that I'm am currently operating is sufficient for the job it is doing.  The answer is three fold, I think.   Primarily, I'm returning, at some point in the near future (January or September of next year) to the University of Waterloo (I think. I may transfer, depending on what I decide I really want to do - some soul searching has to be done here.) I'd like a workstation that can go with me. Part of the problem previously has been that I'm not a particularly good notetaker with pen and paper, however, when it comes to typing, I've usually got the word down before it's out of the prof's mouth. My PDA was an acceptable solution for this, but it led to hours of post class formatting, which was less learning and more typographic acrobatics. A notebook, particularly an iBook with it's long battery life and small footprint would be ideal in moving from class to class.  Secondly, I'd like a wireless solution for home and for the road that is more integrated than my PDA or my cell phone. I'd like to have the same level of technical capability while retaining my mobility. I have a hankering to sit in coffeehouses, parks, restaurants and bookstores and simply type, read, analyze, examine, create etc. etc. etc. The one thing that pains me in regards to my current existence is being bound to the basement of my house. I've got a lovely little setup with a 17" LCD monitor and so on, however, even with my wireless capabilities as they stand, I've been relegated to the lowest point in the house. Frustrating, though I've done a good deal to make it more homely.  Which brings me to my third and final point:  I'd like to embrace the creative side of my personality with more vigour. I've found a renewed interest in photography and videography and I have a lovely feeling about some creative writing. Words, ideas and images have just been popping into my head lately, things so intense that I've been driving to write them down on little scraps, even start to sketch things! (You have no idea how bizarre this is - my ability to transfer a mental image to the page is legendary in it utter lack of quality. Truly, among those who simply for lack of a better work  suck  at illustration, I am a master). "What would this have to do with a laptop?", you ask? Well, I believe, and my recent experience with my new work environment is the only proof I need, that a clean and streamlined working environment frees the mind and encourages creativity. While I know the pretension is simply dripping from that statement, I just feel things flow more with a "lubricated" (for the lack) canvas. This is something that I think I've known for a while - it's effects were emphasized when I downloaded and started using iTunes. The Macintosh environment, for me, is a work friendly environment.  With that said, I'm no closer to my decision than when I started. I think I'm really going to have to sleep on this. If anyone out there has an opinion on it, drop me a line.
