I understand the concept of psuedocode but I don't know where to begin with pseudocode.  Geeze that doesn't even make sense to me :(   What I mean is since psuedocode is similar to code I get confused when its time to change an algorithm to psuedocode.  I would like to give a shout out to the Mrs.  You know who I'm talking about Mr. Hardin!  I guess I should have known other people would be reading this..... I hate journals!  So anyway, yeah I've already confused myself trying to explain my own confusion.  Well I was gonna end this blog with a joke but being that I was in the Navy for a while I can't seem to think of any jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences...... So I'll just take a bow :)
