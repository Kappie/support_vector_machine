With this entry, I hope to describe in clear form some of the understandings I have gleamed off my study.   I find that the development of Macbeth as a character is of particular importance in the workings of it as a tragedy and play. At the beginning of the play, the premonitions of evil are set by the witches in their meetings, and particularly the effect of mentioning Macbeth's name produces a strong sense that this man will be touched by evil, and inevitably be doomed. It also shows how evil, in the form of the three hags, and bad weatherare extremely powerful forces that bring the downfall of many things, a man to say the least.   In the first few scenes up to Macbeth's meeting with the witches Macbeth is presented as a most noble and courageous warrior andservant to the King and country. I found the particular imagery of the battle and how Macbeth supposedly dominated the battlefield with his fearless veracity would produce a rather strong effect of how worthy a man Macbeth is, as the audience of the time thrived on morals shown on the battlefield. Unlike the more peaceable times of today, war in the 16th century was still glorified and regarded as the ultimate testing ground where a man could display himself as truly great. With this in mind, Shakespeare by using such battle imagery in the reports of Macbeth gives the effect of a great man, noble and loyal to his King and country.    With this first impression of Macbeth as the exemplified warrior and noble, the tone of the tragedy is set, and the seedlings of the heroes downfall planted.
