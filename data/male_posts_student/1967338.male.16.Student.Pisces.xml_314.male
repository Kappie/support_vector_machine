She's an hour away, so calling would be expensive, and she doesn't have a computer.  So summing up. Random cute redhead gives marten, who has a girlfriend now for those who don't know, her address. I have to write letters now. I mean, what can I do? She's going to find me at the next event anyway, so I cant ignore her. Besides, she seemed cool, I don't want to be mean.  But Kaylee will definately be a subject of my first letter, so she doesn't get any ideas.  Tammy's testicle ad may compromise our ability to win this task.
