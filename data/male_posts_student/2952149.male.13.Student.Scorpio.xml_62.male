Yeah it was kind of nasty but it was a funny movie so whatever. Well I am just sitting here....doing nothing....bored. Call me Stacey! This summer hasn't exactly been all that fun. All I do is sit around, watch T.V, and play videogames. Maybe once and I while I will hang out with some friends but that is rare. So...ya nothin else to say....
