I mean, would you like some guy named Bubba to come stalk to you down and beat you to a bloody pulp? Heck no! I think I would prefer to keep my two front teeth intact, a-thank you.  However, if I was in the middle of nowhere (and I won't mention any states) then I might be willing to flip someone off for fun. I can drive 100 MPH in the middle of nowhere and who is going to pull me over, the cops? Okay, so maybe they will pull me over. But what happens if they run out of ink for their pen so they can write me a ticket. Do I offer him or her a pen?   Ahh..... a moral dillema!
