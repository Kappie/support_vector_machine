I’m still cracking on my thesis. I should start my documentation today .Hell with Pete, I'm gonna show him how much I’ve done till date. I just wanna go back and recover from this shitty phase i am in, and after that who knows. Turkey, Canadia, Australia , J or prolly stay in B’lore .. Move away from mum and dad. I dunno.  In other news today, Lisa was being a B***H (again) acting rather rude. .. So I just let her be (was fun ignoring her and not having to listen to stupid remarks being said about me because I was ignoring her) .. guess she was having a shitty day too... was on the phone all day, and watching tele (I'm not complaining). The stupid Git burnt the carpet and wants to blame the Chinese housemates who had stayed here previously. I just nodded my head in affirmation .I'm gonna shift sides depending on the situation.  She touched a raw nerve when she said that we can blame the Chinese for burning the hob. Yeah right, wasn’t she the one who walked in to the accommodation office and told them that i set the kitchen afire , and nagged to Sally’s friends (hell she doesn’t even know them.. they were there just for the night) about me burning the whole place up? Once people are in shit how quickly they forget the past .  Trying to install XP on Virtual PC and hopefully I’d have doom3 downloaded too. More on that later.  * 4 hours later* Damn Virtual PC  emulates a S3 Trio 32/64 [ sheesh ] doom3 doesnt work on that [Sheesh *2]
