God be Damned with Mercy deep within the Soul of mourning doom.  Human enigma encroached with anarchic  Belonging.  Home, the murder of every Prey in the service of the system.  Roam through the valley of vultures Wherein wholeness breaks diversities Of a world never existing in the mouth  Write the blank, the emptiness of vastness Rejuvenate gloom in the eyes and see Nudity, Freedom.  Walk tread, and fall through Deathâ€™s River.  STYX.
