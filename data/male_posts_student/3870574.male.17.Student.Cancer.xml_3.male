Faith      President Bush is a man of great faith. He was a former alcoholic that seeked God to help reform his life. He pulled himself up by the bootstraps with his faith giving him strength. As a Christian, George W. Bush represents the Judeo-Christian values that the majority of Americans hold, and represents the history of what this country was founded on. All though President Bush is a man of faith, he knows the value of being "strong in faith and secular in politics". His faith gives him the strength and moral conviction to do what is right for the country.  With his proposed faith-based initiatives, it gives children to go to community centers where the church is the only place where there is the only safe haven.           Economy:           The economy has been through some tough times.After inheriting an economy that was slumping near the end of the Clinton Adminstration, President Bush was handed the tragedy of the September 11th attacks on our nation, which deeply hurt American businesses and American confidence dramatically. Furthermore, the high-profile corporate scandals of Enron and WorldCom compounded to the problem by weaking confidence in our nations CEO's. Americans were wary of buying stocks of companies in fear that they were "cooking the books".           The President sprung to action and cut the nations taxes so that the money would not be with the government; it would be the with the people that know what is best for that money...the American people.       GDP grew by more than 5 percent over the last three quarters, the fastest rate of growth in nearly two decades.       Productivity grew at the fastest 3-year rate in more than 50 years.       In terms of creating jobs, it could not be any stronger. The tax cuts have put more money in the pockets of our small businesses so that they can buy more equipment and hire more workers.       Since last August, over 1.4 million new jobs have been created.       The unemployment rate has fallen from 6.3 to 5.6 percent, below the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.       This job growth is widespread – employment over the last year was up in 44 of the 50 states, and the unemployment rate was down in 46 of the 50 states.

Homeland and National Security:      The highest priority of President Bush is to keep Americans safe. He is decisive in his actions. He has the moral clarity to differenciate the difference between good and evil. He has the courage to stand up to dictators, despots, terrorists and tell them that America will respond to attacks on our country and we will take the fight to them. He believes in the philosophy of going after the terrorists before they come here.      He has created many new measures to make it harder for terrorists to attack on the homeland. With the Passage of the USA Patriot Act, inter-agency communication is improved. President Bush has created a number of new agencies that make it faster and easier for our border agents and airport screeners to identify known terrorists.      Furthermore, with the creation of the Homeland Security Department, we now have an agency that is totally focused on preventing and protecting the American homeland from terrorist attacks.       Iraq       President Bush was given a choice. He was to take the word of the CIA to defend America, or take the word of Saddam Hussein. Given that choice, he will defend America every time. With the liberation of Iraq and Afghanistan, 50 million oppressed people now have the taste of freedom.      Even though there is more work to be done in Iraq, we are getting the job done right. President Bush does not believe that running away would be sending the correct message to the terrorists or to the world. America will not waver in the face of terror. We will stand up even when our "allies" will not. Eventually, our strength and resolution will bring them to our side.      We should not have to ask the United Nations, France and Germany permission to defend America.       Our servicemen and women represent the best America has. I deeply thank the brave servicemen that risk their lives so that we will be safe and that the Iraqi people will be free.
