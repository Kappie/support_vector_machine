I ate one of the biggest hamburgers I've ever seen in my entire life for dinner. This thing was massive, when it was sitting on the Barbecue I even asked if it was a Steak! I managed to almost eat the whole thing though, I was pretty hungry.  Today was ok as well I guess. I went out with my dad and sister. She and my dad insisted on seeing Spider-man, so we did. Then I bought a really cool Dream Theater album, it's one of their best, and it was only 10 bucks!  One last thing before I end this. I'm more than likely seeing Fear Factory on August 3rd! That's gonna be one hell of a sweet show! I'm looking forward to it too, because a friend of mine has already been to the Opera House and says that it has a great sound system. Nice!
