I keep learning from mistakes I have made (which is a good thing), therefore, making the relationship really stronger (in my opinion anyway). Not one disagreement or argument arose yesterday. First we went around town in pound shops where Mandy bought piles of crap. We also visited a sex shop where Mandy also bought some stuff. And then we got a bus to my house... and had lots of fun. When it was time for her to go home, I got the bus into town with her to make sure she was safe (because Manchester is spooky at night!). Going out with her tomorrow to some place for a meal. It will be fun and scary, because it's with her workmates, and I don't know any of them really. Anyway. I found out I'm boring, yay! xx
