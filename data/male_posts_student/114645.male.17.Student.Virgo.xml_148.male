Ever feel like you could just go AGH! And just yell at the world? Well that is how I currently feel, and I'm not quite sure why. I don't know if it is Ryan, or people in general or the stress with school or what. This weekend I was so happy, and then it just went downhill.   So today was my first day back at school since two weeks ago. It was good to be back in the routine I guess. I missed seeing people I hadn't seen in a while, but mostly everyone was just ....there.... I don't know why either. I don't know if this new year was different or what. It just seemed different I guess. Anyway. In Physics we started a chapter on heat. FINALLY! A chapter with a subject I know! And it starts next semester, when grades go back to A's again. French comes next. In French I find out we have a test. JOY! How I love tests...... NOT! All we had to do was explain passe compose and translate sentences from French to English and conjugate verbs, like finir and aller. Wasn't it fun?   Then I went to Aviation. We had to finish our test we started before break. Chapter 5 I think. So we started passing them out and Mr. Kelly went outside and came back in and told one of the other Ben's to go get a janitor, because someone had thrown up. It was him. Mr. Kelly blew chunks, well, not really chunks. More like acid and water. It was gross, and after 2nd people was WALKING in it! Ewww!  Moving on......  Then I went to American Lit. Miss Nickels got a hair cut. It looks nice. We just talked about our review, and we gossiped mostly all period. It was fun. I love it when teachers talk and we get NOTHING done! It is great. Then I went to lunch. Lunch seemed, kinda ....off.... and I don't know why. I guess because Cripple wasn't there. But maybe it was just because it was cold. It was cold WITH my bomber jacket on. Then I went to history and watched yet more presentations. Vince's project sucked. He didn't even stay on the topic. Come on people. Then Joe did his. He did well. Would have done better with Power Point, but he chose not to use it. Oh well, I made my $20. Then was math and French Aide. Trystin wasn't here today. It sucked. But Leland was, but the ass didn't say hi to me.    Well that is all for tonight. Oh and keep a look out for audio blogs. I will be posting soon.    Oh, Nat, don't worry about the Vinni thing. Just call him, and everything will be alright. I promise!
