It would have been even more fun if more people from choir showed up... hehe.  I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to choir this next year.  The new people that I know of I don't like that much... and I think its going to be a lot more than I was planning on getting into choir for.  Supposedly we are hiring a choreographer, but I am not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing yet, because I don't want it to be too serious, because then it wouldn't be any fun.  Oh well, hopefully everything will turn out alright and stuff.  I so wish that I had a little dude who lived in my closet or something and played guitar really well so we could jam out all night, that would be really cool, because I really wanna play with someone.  I haven't played with anyone in FOREVER.  David came over today and we messed around for a bit and then he copied a bunch of CDs that I got at Warped, it was fun.  So yeah..... see ya
