No scripture(which may sound heretical) and what mystifies and raises this writing more is the fact that it is with music, the language which all humans know    "When the cold of Winter comes    Starless night will cover day    In the veiling of the sun    We will walk in bitter rain          But in dreams      I still hear your name     And in dreams     We will meet again      When the seas and mountains fall     And we come, to end of days     In the dark i hear a call     Calling me there     I will go there     And back again"                           -Fran Walsh   Such is life and the path is treads from friendships to that of a deeper substance, that which is beyond all comprehension and/or logic
