The designes of streets and the way the cars crash or explode is not so graphically good. In my opinion this game is a half Matrix Reloaded and half GTA Series.With a glancy look at the fights that are really not so natural and the way of driving in streets(which is mostly a chore)you will get to the same result as mine.it also reminds me Max Payne!! But all of the game is not so bad.one of the good points in the game is that you can have the story go in many ways.for example if you fail a mission you can continue the game and see the results and its effect in the story.and sometimes the episode could be played in 2 or more ways to continue the story. I don't know what would you say but i enjoyed the dialoges in the game. and at the end I have to say sth about the story that I really don't know weather it's a good one or not.Please help me findout about it and give me your opinions. About the system requirements i have to say that it won't cost you much. So enjoy the game!
