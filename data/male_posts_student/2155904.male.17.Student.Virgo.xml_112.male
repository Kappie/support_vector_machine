The past few Wednesdays at school haven't really been that great.  They're still within the top two in best days of the week though.  The beauty with Wednesdays is there is hardly ever enough time in each class for it to be miserable.  Not even English and the eternal quiz.  That quiz was loooong and dumb.  But don't let Tyke get ahead of himself.  Math was fine today.  Tyke got tired of having to do his homework at home (doing=making up funny things to say that vaguely resemble a legitimate answer) so he buckled down and managed to do it in class (do=same as previous).  Then it was off to 2nd period.  And it was cardio day so that meant 8 minute abs.  An easy breeze as usual.  Tyke works his abs much better at home than in 8 minute abs.  Maybe he doesn't do them as well in school.  In any case, it was easy.  But then they had to run 2 laps so that wasn't much fun but it was warm and windy out so it was pleasant.  3rd period was just a couple of fire lanes that Tyke didn't participate in but it was somewhat enjoyable to watch.  Then came the gay quiz in English.  It was long and Tyke just made up funny answers (similar to how he does his math homework).  But he still managed to tie Amed so he must be smart.  HA!  Yeah, right.  Just over 25% isn't good, is it?  But then came lunch so that was good.  McDonald's seemed deserted.  There was hardly anyone in there.  Dr. Phil got interested in the nutrition facts so he went and picked em up.  And they found out how unhealthily they were eating.  Tyke had about 55 grams of fat with his meal.  Amed had 33.  Haha.  And Amed thought the chicken wasn't too bad.  Or maybe he didn't, if he didn't then sorry.  5th period is just boring.  Tyke doesn't ever feel like working on his city drawing so he just sits there and erases lines and just doesn't really do anything at all.  6th period was fun though.  Tyke actually wants the student teacher lady to keep teaching.  She is fun now.  She doesn't act like she is really smart.  And the class just talks a lot when she is teaching so it is just a fun environment.  And tomorrow Tyke and Purdy have a lab to do so that will be fun.  After school Tyke came home and watched a little Full House while eating and then played ESPN.  His baller is getting better still but the 1 on 1 has gotten harder.  Yao was really hard to beat.  It was a 21-19 win for Tyke and his baller, "Chris Landreth."  And Tyke wins 21-0 quite frequently so it was really close.  It is harder to drain the 3 bombs with a 7'5" man in front of you.  Believe you him.  Tyke's teammate for the 2 on 2 matches is Sam Cassell who is ok on defense but he is a retard.  He can't ever do anything right.  And he blows at rebounding.  He couldn't even jump if there was an alligator 1 foot away from him that was about to eat him and the only way he could survive is by jumping 4".  He would get eating.  Such a dumbass.  But Tyke still wins.  After that Tyke talked online a little and then ate dinner.  It was tortellini with a sauce that was good, but only in moderation.  Some things are like that.  Like Tyke takes a little test bite and really likes it so he has more of it next time.  But then it doesn't taste as good.  Or bad even.  This sauce was an example of that.  So he had some doses of it sparingly.  "You drove home real quick.  Did you make it in time to masturbate?"  Name the song.  Win a prize.  Oh yeah, before Tyke forgets again he forgot to tell you something yesterday.  When he got home and checked the mail he found out he had made $14.  A long while back Tyke's pop told him about a CD settlement where if you had bought a CD in Washington within the last 5 years or so you would be entitled to an undisclosed amount of money.  So Tyke filled out a little form and ta da!  Tyke found a check from Attorney General Christine Gregoir for $13.86.  His dad just decided to cash the check for him and then gave him an even $14.  So he made a cool $14 just for walking 30 feet and getting the mail.  A nice little bonus.  But back to tonight.  Tyke ate dinner and then listened to some music and watched Newlyweds and Death Do Us Part.  Newlyweds is fun.  Jessica Simpson is just so hot.  And Nick Lachey seems like a cool guy.  But not in a gay way.  Then Tyke...oh wait that is really all he did.  Oh yeah, he watched this thing on the Discovery channel about the assasination of JFK.  It was pretty interesting.  Too bad they don't know for sure how it happened and who did it.  But then it wouldn't be a mystery.  On the show they showed the full footage of the assasination though.  Tyke had never seen it fully.  Wow, it really was the murder of a human being.  For some reason Tyke always thought that assasinations weren't gruesome or never really imagined it.  But it was.  The footage actually shows his head exploding.  That sniper bullet did its damage indeed.  It was, totally wrong word here, almost cool.  But only in the dark sense of the word and just because it is totally real and gruesome.  But enough about exploding dead guys.  Hope you have a dreamy night where the Care Bears, Muppet Babies, and Berenstein Bears invade your dreams and have a tea party on a cloud.  And Amelia Earhart is invited too.  But she can only stay for an hour cuz she has to fly to Puerto Rico to meet up with Caligula.
