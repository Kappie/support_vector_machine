First, Let me show you something that happened on the Blue Man boards just now...  In the new Blue Man Album, they have these "rock concert movements," but in the list, they skipped 5 to confuse everyone, and this kid thinks that just because they skipped to 6, it's a devil reference.  quote: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Originally posted by DarkMeasures: I don't know but I think BMG already has devil references in "What is Rock". Otherwise the yelling rock concert movement would have been 5... --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I'm sorry darkmeasures- i hate to do this- oh wait, i don't- if you seriously believe that, I don't respect your opinion anymore. Simple as that.  Oh, and if anybody sides with him, yeah... no more opinion respecting for you.  Just remember- I'm not the one being unfair here. if i had it my way, if someone who won an Oscar has to be played off the stage, they would lose their award.  "Oh, you gonna force us to get you off the stage? No more golden man for you."    So dreadfully true. This kid either is so "rebellious" that he will only listen to music if it has some kind of deeper meaning that would piss his parents off, or else he's some dork whose parents teach him that anything even resembling anything written by anybody that even remotely looks like something the devil pooped out, is wrong and should be killed.     SteelxXxDragonX: remember those TATU girls? ShuChoMouff: Remember[what?]... they were around BEFORE nickelodeon whored them? SteelxXxDragonX: lol SteelxXxDragonX: what did u think of them? ShuChoMouff: well, they make out on stage ShuChoMouff: ... SteelxXxDragonX: ya ShuChoMouff: they MAKE OUT on STAGE SteelxXxDragonX: lol SteelxXxDragonX: so im guessing you like them? ShuChoMouff: they... MAKE OUT... on STAGE SteelxXxDragonX: lol SteelxXxDragonX: they do more then MAKE OUT on stage ShuChoMouff: i know SteelxXxDragonX: wet t-shirt contest!! lol ShuChoMouff: i havent ever heard their music- noone ever plays their music, all you ever see is them making out on stage SteelxXxDragonX: lol SteelxXxDragonX: they have a few good songs ShuChoMouff: oh em eff gee ShuChoMouff: clownstaples  The conversation just went downhill from there.      I sawed Hellboy. It was fairly badass.   You know those people who got pissed because it didn't follow the comic book? Were you one of them? Fuck you, you're stupid.   It didn't follow the comicbook because the movie was set in the REAL WORLD where the comic book was based on a real thing. Did you dumbasses even watch the movie? He HELD the comic book and said "I hate that comic book. They never got the eyes right." Fuckers.  But yeah, that girl had the coolest superpower ever. She was like friction-woman. When she got angry/excited(more than 1 way), she CAUGHT ON FIRE. Not that regular pussy yellow fire either, this was the blue hardcore shit.  She blew up an insane asylum, and I bet she killed a bunch of insane people with it, so she gets kudos for that. 150 less insane people to deal with.  Hmm... what else.  South Park and Chapelle's show were both insane. Holy shit. I'm not even going to explain it. Just that Wayne Brady... I didn't know he had it in him :-O  I'll talk about other shizzle tomato. Good night. (morning, whatever.)
