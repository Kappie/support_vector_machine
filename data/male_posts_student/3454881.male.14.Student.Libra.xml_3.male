I believe the Iraq War was the right thing to do because we had to get a dictator out of power and stop him from oppressing his ppl. 3. We have to stay in Iraq until we hand over the power and even then, help them if they need it. 4. Democrats are wrong. 5. The media has a liberal bias. 6. Abortion: I think it should be restricted so that only ppl who have been raped or are in danger of their own lives can get abortion. 7. George W. Bush is a very good president. 8. I dislike Kerry. I just don't trust him in any way. 9. We must reduce the national deficit. 10. Improve the economy!!
