In health we somehow managed to go from a definition of emotional health to whether it's okay for America's presidents to get head. I wasn't really mood for so much idealism so damn early in the day. That's why I'm gonna wake up early and go for a quick run tomorrow. Hopefully I'll have a bit more energy when I get to school.   Life skills is the only class I really have to worry about though. It's just a bit boring. After those two hours though, I'm pretty much home free. I get to walk home, listening to my CDs along the way. Yumm.  Maybe I should actually do that life skills homework now. Wuuuuutever. It's either that or listening to music for a while, but Ill prebably jus do both at the same time and get nothing done =P.
