I missed church, sing, and 2 phone calls cuz i was on the comp playing sc or listening to music or playing xbox... could some1 plz buy me a life!!!   Well something meaningful did happen.  While i was laying in my bed, thinking about some1, that some1 called me as i was about to doze off.  I was momentarily startled when the phone rang, and i was confused when the caller display said "Caller ID Blocked".  I know of 2 ppl who when they call me it says that, and neither of them would call me at this time.  Well now i know 3!! :D  Anyways, being the worst person to talk to on the phone, after a smooth start i messed up the rest of the convo because of my introvertness.  Then i completely ruined it when i took to long to plug in my charger and let my phone die... ya im an idiot... the sad part is that i didnt get to say goodbye...  Today (Monday):  Woke up, msn, sc, lunch (leftover lasagna which was left on the counter over nite >. Well, after finally dragging myself off the comp, i had 20 mins to get to work... and i still had to shower and stuff!!  So i RAN upstairs, JUMPED in the shower, and did my thang.  ARRGHH!!! I wanted to shave too.  I swear i look like a bum if i dont shave regularily.  My facial hair doesnt come out evenly, its like random patches here and there.  I HATE IT!!!  Well when i was in the shower, i decided that i would shave anyways.  But i wanted to save time so i shaved in the shower instead of the usual in the kitchen sink.  I prefer the sink cuz i can watch myself, make sure i dont miss any spots, that my sideburns are even and then to admire myself when im done... ya, im so dreamy... :P  Well after the shower. i admired myself anyways, prettied myself up and left the bathroom. I then went to my room and checked the time: 2:58... wow, i took only 18 mins in the bathroom!!  Well i was late as usual so i started to take my time again.  As i listened to some Usher and sang along i slowly got dressed.  I realised that i really need to wash that uniform... both of them.  Finally i arrived at work When i got there... there was NOTHING to do!!! -_-  Like most of u are prolly like "so what? thats good!!" well its not cuz i have to look buzy for my bosses (well only one today, whew) ... Anyways, i filled a pop display, filled the sugar and the big bottles of water which killed an hour.  An hour??!!! that means 5 more to go??   > It WAS a long day.  Well after that hr of work... i was left to find my own work to look busy so that i will NOT get in trouble from my boss.  Finally he left, so i went upstairs to take a nice long break.  BUT I DID NOT STEAL!!! YAY!!!  thx for the prayers.  Well i came back when the grocery order came in to find a skid full of water had caved in one one corner.  Well we were gonna slowly wheel it outta the truck wit me and another guy supporting that corner... but we figured that it was gonna topple over when it hit the ramp, so we decided to try to use the "straddle stacker".  Most of u dont know what that is so i wont explain... but to use it me and another guy had to lift up that HEAVY skid so that it would be level.  But as some1 tried to get it off, the one underneath slipped.  The other guy who was helping me left laid off, and i was left to support it all on my own!!!  It was quite heavy... if it dropped it coulda seriously harmed a child... but it wasnt so bad cuz i was just holding it up.  So i stood there straining my arms asking if i should let go... a few long seconds later they told me to let it go.  CRASH!!!  The bottles at the bottom fell to the floor... but i was still holding the side... if i let that go it woulda crushed me against the wall... >. Sadly i did some serious lifting and my left forearm hurts... t.t  o well i cant think of anything else to write and da rentz are kicking me off...  [23]
