I woke up and felt really bad, looked around for food for half an hour, and ended up cooking and eating 6 strips of bacon [not half-pieces, full pieces] and running to the bus stop and smoking two ciggs, my lucky from my old pack, and my new pack I just opened then. Nicotine + Bacon overdose + bumpy bus ride = imminent bad feelings :/, luckily, I didn't puke. It's Alison and Emily's birthday today, [they're my beautiful twin friends] so Happy Birthday you two :). I'm starving, so I'm going to go eat my steak dinner [ :D ] and cut the lawn after [ :( ]. Later.
