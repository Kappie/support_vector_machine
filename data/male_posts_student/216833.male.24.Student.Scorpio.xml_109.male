I'm stoked, she passed my resume on to the hiring manager and I am supposed to talk with a team of peers on Monday for a Technical Screen.  The position is located in Napa, CA. Home of wine and beatiful country side. Plus it's not as far as San Francisco. I hope everything goes well with this becuase I could really move around in a company that size. The client that I would be working with is the largest hospital in Napa County. The Queen of the Valley  That will be interesting.   I am hitting the books heavy. I want to do something fun. Metal shows suck these days.
