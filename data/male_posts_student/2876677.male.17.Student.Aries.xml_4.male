My parents are upset because Seth got kicked out.  He is the retard.  They think it is unfair the first kid gets warned and the second kid gets punished.  Maybe so.  I don't care.  It is doubtful my class will ever have to deal with it.  Even if we do, I think I can handle a zero in a few classes for day.  Who cares.  Life is life.  Move on.  Blah blah.  Maybe there should be a blanket warning at the beginning to all kids and then the first kid gets kicked out.  I don't care.
