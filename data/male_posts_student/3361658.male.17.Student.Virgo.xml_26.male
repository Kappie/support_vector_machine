This is pretty cool stuff.      I cant count for shit... well I can I just cant count the right way.  But even better than that is I waited to punch in cuz I thought I was suppose to be working 1:15 to 10:15... it turns out I was suppose to be working from 1:00 to 10:15.  So I punched in at 1:08 cuz I thought it would be early but I wasnt, i was actually late (by one minute).  Oh well.  That  was my fun-filled day.  (Well yesterday's fun-filled day).  Oh! and if you care: Current Mood - Happy  : ) Current Music - Dave Matthews Band - What Would You Say
