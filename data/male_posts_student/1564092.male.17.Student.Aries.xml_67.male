I think this is going to be a  major  test for myself personally in the way I handle things, the way I think about somethings, and the way I go about doing somethings. A whole bunch of things that I need to think about but I am going to have an awesome time on the trip regardless.. please don't get me wrong. The people I am going with are beyond words especially those few of you who I would lay my life down for.. can't wait to spend more time with you guys this week! Let the fun begin and I just pray everything goes well, that our message is delivered, and people are, within our own group and everyone we come into contact with, are touched my Him just as we have been.  We should be back Saturday afternoon.. that's June 12. I should post some pictures from my camera phone through out the week and I'm taking a camera or two and I am determined to capture memories on this trip.  I'm tired and still waiting on the dryer to stop so I'm sorry if the grammar and spelling is bad. Double checked it all but to excited and wiped to care really. ;-)  Until I ramble on again..
