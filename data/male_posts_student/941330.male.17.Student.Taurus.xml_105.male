(thank you daily show)  adam's party was fun. one of adam's cousins looks like richard, glasses and everything. except buffer. i drank roughly a dozen cans of soda, cuz i'm on sugar withdrawal...i barely eat processed foods. ditz the ritz. and stuff. adam played matrix music in all his spiky haired glory, kevin wanted to play alex's boxcar racer cd, pat stole the la-z-boy, basho gingerly touched my hair, erik murdered james in dynasty warriors 3 ("100 kills! go james!" when erik reached like 450), melissa came in and smacked ankur a lot. adam's room is cool, it has a jet li pic, a bazillion games ("they all suck" said melissa), teddy bear wallpaper he refuses to put down, that beaver that goes "kung fu fighting," etc. we played football (which was kinda crappy) and basketball ("you can be the hero! give iran something to be proud of!"), melissa kinda ripped kevin's cellphone a new one, but he needed a new faceplate anyway. she tried to make me then pat give flowers to some 7th grade girl, but instead she gave them to a guy named "tom tom" then ran back yelling "i did it! i did it!" smooth haha. went back inside, melissa was reading some girly magazine and we pointed out a few pics that owen might like (read: anything with a body part of a girl). she thought lucy liu looked like kat...ehh. the guys played soccer...haha pat slide tackled anything that moved, even the goalie. kevin kept on kicking it into the stands for no real reason. was it ankur...he'd always kick the ball 50 feet above the goalpost then complain his team was worse than pat's. cool stuff.   alex came over today to print stuff for biology, he annihilated me in street...21-3? but i broke his streak after 3, which he predicted. "uh oh, i won the tip..." maybe it was cuz he was listening to a star trek episode...who knows. oh, and random news:  urlLink arnold schwarzenegger is running for governor ! so is  urlLink gary coleman and d.l. hughley ...what has our state come to...whatever it is, it's pretty funny. go ahh-nold!
