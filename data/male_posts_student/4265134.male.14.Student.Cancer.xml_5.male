It's like a stray cat that stays in the back alley of your apartment, meowing and meowing the WHOLE NIGHT. So eventually you end up throwing a shoe or a brick down the windowsill at any moving object down below.. and then end up missing.. and it's still there.. Anyways..      I turned on Spyware Blaster, a new spyware remover I downloaded off of Kazza. Works like a charm, but when I turn it off the spyware comes back. Not to mention the lag I experience on Counter-Strike because of all this goddamned spyware.
