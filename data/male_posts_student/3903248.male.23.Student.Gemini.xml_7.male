There are all kinds of free e-mail services out there, and I have an account on most of them.  But dammit, this is gmail we're talking about!  For those not aware, gmail is Google's new e-mail service.  They give you 1Gig of storage and all kinda other goodness.  Sounds good, right?  Of course it does.  But, there is a catch.  Gmail is still in the Beta stage, so accounts are not available to the public.  Only a select few have an account and the only way to get an account is to have someone who already has an account to invite you.  I know, it's complicated.  Anyways, I've been wanting one for months just to say I have one, and now I do.  God save eBay.  My new account is:  urlLink rpemberton@gmail.com    So feel free to e-mail me and help me get my money's worth.  Until then...
