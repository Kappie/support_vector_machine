It's because I've loved her for the past 3 years, and looking at how things have turned out, it's better for me to forget rather than salvage. I chose not to salvage as I know that I would make the situation worse.  Many things happened yesterday. I asked friend T to accompany me to Hougang again, but he said that there's no point going there if we do not know which block she stays. I braved myself to message her to ask which block she stays. She said the same things like before, she said that she's not home. Then I replied that I'd be there later in the evening. Then she told me to message her when I'm in the area to see if she's home.  After a while, friend T told me that he don't want to tag along, which made me pissed off. Then I messaged her to tell her that friend T won't be coming along with me, but I'll keep my promise to be there. Then she replied that she would be home very late, even not going home at all. I knew this was an excuse, but I chose to trust her. I sent her a message asking her to give me a message when she reaches home. I knew she won't reply, yet I continued to send another message. I sent her a message stating that I'd wait for her message, even if it'd deprive me of my sleep. But, my darn body could not take the fatigue of the day. I collasped at 1am...  When I woke up this morning, I checked my phone. No messages. I felt sad, of course. It seems like I do not even exist in her eyes... Haizzz... Now, I just want to forget her. Give me 3 years. Maybe I'll forget her cleanly from my mind. What I'm afraid of is that 3 years is not enough for my undying love for her...
