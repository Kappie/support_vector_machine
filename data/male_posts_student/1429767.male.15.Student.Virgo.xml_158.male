At the beginning of the year it was great to see everyone again as we returned to school from a long summer, everyone had loads of stories to tell about what they did or what happened to them over the summer. we all promised to get together last summer every week so we wouldnt get behind in whats going on in each other's lives, after a few weeks we stopped and didnt talk much after that so the first day of school is always great, you see how everyone has changed, and what the year is going to mean to you finally... as the year drew on i began to come closer and closer to comming out, everyday i thought about it, it kept becoming more and more of an issue in my mind, i wanted to tell someone but i just couldnt... so then what i like to call my "niles days" came to be, i started to talk to keems more and more and then we started going into chat rooms and i met eric and justin on there with keems, i soon learned about eric and justin and i increasingly became to like eric alot, we would go into chat rooms all the time on the weekends till like 2 or 3 in the morning having a great time until i couldnt possibly stay awake anymore. so eventually me and eric started talking on the phone and it was cool and all then his mom got rid of the internet so i ended up never really ever talking to him anymore so that just kind of changed the way i thought about him, sure i missed him a lil afterwards but then i just got over it and had a great time. the "niles days" were at an end... then i came out to melissa and it turned out to be the greatest thing that ive done in a long time, she was totally ok with it of course and i started to feel better about myself again, it felt like a big weight was lifted off of my shoulders, suddenly everyone knew about me and i didnt have to live 2 lives anymore and it was great. after that i started to get really lonely because well friends are great and all its just they cant comfort you like a boyfriend/girlfriend can (no nasty way either) so things got steadily worse for me and i just kept thinking no one was out there for me until i met chad and we talked for a couple months and then met and things just fell apart from there, im no going to get into that right now its behind me now... after me and chad ended i came close to overdosing on any type of pill that i could get my hands on but i stopped myself because i thought about everyone that i still had in my life, it was then i realized that without chad i wasnt any different i was just a friend short was all so i put that behind me and now im pretty good, sure i still get lonely now but ive been talking to steve for a couple days now and he's awesome (sorry had to say it bud!) so things are pretty good right now, exams are coming and a great summer is yet to come, with the warped tour 2 times this summer (july and august) i have something GREAT to look forward to, along with going to the  urlLink liquid room  with melissa and courtney its going to be an awesome summer, plus a few ventures to the mall to got check out hot topic and just hangout, thats what im really looking forward to besides the warped tour, this summer is going to be full of great things it appears... this year is going to be great and this past year was awesome.....
