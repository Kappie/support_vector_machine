I sat there alone, wrote her name in the sand beside me to my left and spoke to her in an audible voice. The first word I said was "Zel" and I felt... different. I've always wanted to go to the beach with her, and she's always been too busy. Always.  Steph Yap's changed a lot. She's a know it all now. My theory is as such. People in SRJC generally aren't as competent as those in FMSS. As such, the opportunity for her to take control there is prevalent. What pisses me off is when she tries doing that with FISH. Wake up lah. She was everywhere. "I'll only help you start the fire, but I wont cook coz I'm wearing contacts." Please lah! Starting it involves more smoke. But of course she knew that already since she's the authority on such matters. You know something, this is not worth it.  I wanna be motivated. Started gymming today. Happy with that. Yong's a bro. I wanna stick up on my wall "You WILL be there! Make it soon!" I wanna judge the standard of Singaporean competition before I enter Idol. What I'm afraid is that Singapore Idol will trigger an unprecedented increase in the general masses interest in improving vocal technique. To put it simply. I'm not sure if I can handle more competition.  Encourage me.
