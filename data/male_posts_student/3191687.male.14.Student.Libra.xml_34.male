Plus, I haven't had my ceffeine.  I got Kyle's and Mark's pages done, though.  They look nice-ish.  Well, they look better.  I still have to get ahold of Josh and Ben (as far as the leaders' section is concerned.  I still have Quentin and Twitch in the scouts'), but if I can't I'll just publish a little scout fleur-de-lis and write it myself.   Hmmm, let's see.  4 more pages to recode and 3 more "biographies" to input, not to mention the people that I don't have data for.  Oh well, no one said this was going to be easy, or enthralling =\  It's fun: in its own, special, weird way.  Oh, couldn't update earlier today b/c blogger was acting up, but, not that y'all missed it anyway =P  Ok, if I don't go to bed soon I might fall asleep on the keyboard, and that wouldn't be good.  Nope, not at all.
