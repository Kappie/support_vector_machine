The guys in Australia are back and I get to have a break from pulling my hair out over worship stuff. I got back my results and I got a D7 in GP (A fail!), a C6 in Mandarin (I can't believe I did better in Chinese than in English!), an AO pass for C Math, a D for Lit (Still an A level pass k!) and an E for Economics (Still a pass also!). I think it's pretty ok. Everything's seemingly great for me, but it ain't.   Note to God: I've tried going on in faith, hoping you would work things out for me God, but they haven't. I'm none more than disappointed. Ok, maybe more than that, I'm hurt... why didn't you do anything? Maybe I'm being silly by blaming you, but really. I can't go on anymore. Won't you do something, something that really matters to me, and win my trust again God? - your kid that really needs help, Sherman   Maybe I should take my results as something that mattered when it didn't? Sigh.  Sherman
