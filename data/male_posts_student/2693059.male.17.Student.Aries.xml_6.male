Tobe dissapointed not get in a good college then goto chabot then just say fuck everything get some weak ass job and become a bum and beg for money in SF. All im doing is prolonging my future. I might as well start now instead of later. Im so damn tired of trying and just being defeated in every damn thing i do. Nothing goes right for me. I don't understand why not, i lose in everything, i wanna know what success feels like. Or accomplishing something. how can i fuck up at everything in my life its just not right.  im so tired of being kicked and kicked while ive already been down.
