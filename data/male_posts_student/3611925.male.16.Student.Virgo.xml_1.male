I'll let you decide on that.  SNK Vs Capcom:  SVC Chaos - September 28, 2004:  Just like Capcom vs SNK, except ten times better to be blunt.  With a diverse selection of characters from the Street Fighter, Darkstalkers, King of Fighters, Art of Fighting, and Fatal Fury series' all playable, you just know that this fighter's gameplay is going to be varied like that of no other.  Street Fighter Aniversary Collection - September 28, 2004:  A compilation of the overly-hyped(?) Street Fighter III:  Third Strike, as well as the also overly-hyped(?) Hyper Street Fighter II which is if I'm not mitaken, a mix of Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Champion Edition, Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting, Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, and Super Street Fighter II Turbo.  Dead or Alive Ultimate - October 4, 2004:  I know that many people feel that the Dead or Alive series isn't that great, at least compared to the almighty Virtua Fighter (or if you're into that Tekken crap), and that it's mainly about the "graphics," but this is the only 3-d fighter (ok, Soul Calibur is pretty good too I suppose) that I've really gotten in to, although I'll admit, I haven't given Virtua Fighter a fair chance to this day.  Dead or Alive Ultimate is a compilation of both Dead or Alive (originally released on the SEGA Saturn) and Dead or Alive 2 (originally released on the SEGA Dreamcast), which is supposed to be upgraded with improved graphics, 8 new fighting environments of which are supposed to have more focus on interactivity, as well as newly added cut-scenes about each characters' past, that go deeper into the Dead or Alive storyline.  And of course, what would a DOA game be without tons of new costumes to unlock?  To quote IGN's X-Box division:    The first disc will features an online version of 1997's original Dead or Alive while Disc 2 will include the enhanced version of Dead or Alive 2, also with online capabilities. But the enhancements here are what compel us to look at this DOA2 as the logical progression of the fighting series and a leap from DOA3.  There are all new tag team moves in DOAU and the same ally-enemy system that makes team moves between friends more dramatic than team moves between enemies. There will be more of an emphasis on rolling and dodging and new countermoves and reversals in DOAU as well. While DOA3 had us fascinated with multilevel combat as we got tossed from rooftops and never ending plateaus, DOAU will have multilevel fighting as well as what Team Ninja refers to as "slope technique". In the trailers, you'll recognize these as the sequences when Gen-Fu is sent rolling down the stairs after being tossed by Lei Fang in the official trailer for the game. Whether it's a short flight of stairs or a little hill that leads to a tiny pond in the wilderness, the slope technique should be a nice twist on the multilevel combat concept.  All characters can use throws to launch enemies down slopes but each character will also have a special slope technique move that should be especially humiliating. You'll recognize this as the sequence where Zack uses Jann Lee as a snowboard and rides him down an icy slope.           Ayane! :D  ...Yeah ok, I went a little overboard on the DOA coverage...   Ultra Bust-A-Move - October 4, 2004:  It's Puzzle Bobble Online, what's there to say except for "frickin' awesome!"  All of the above are to have X-Box Live support.  The reason why I'm even mentioning these games is because that I feel that they will justify purchasing an X-Box Live account in the future even more-so if you're not interested in much of the current line-up (which seems to understandably be an issue with fighter and RPG fans), which in itself is quite congenial, just lacking in the fighters/RPG's department, especially with the cancellation of True Fantasy Online.  I would have made a lot of the above into links, but it's late and I'm tired, so expect another update tomorrow with more information.
