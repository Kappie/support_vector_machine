Everyone is demanding that we have sealed/draft at Game Castle on Friday, so I'm allowing them to use their powers of democracy and they're having a goddamn draft.   I don't know how fun starter-divas-divas draft will be, though.   So tomorrow/later today I'm gonna head to Kenosha and beat up JDub and the Team Biznitch crew and win me a Raw IC belt, because I Am That Damned Good. I am thinking about using BackTo Basics Mankind. That deck is mad fun. I love drawing 2 a turn when you've only got 40 cards in your deck. It really sucks, though, when they're an aggro deck (especially SCSA) and you don't draw a reversal. Today, I played against Mr. Cold, and he did Austin Kick->Austin Elbow->Atomic Lariat->Atomic Lariat on his first turn. That sucked.   I played some games with Wisconsin Style Ric Flair. Wisconsin Style? Yeah, cuz it's cheese. Get it? Wisconsin... cheese... damn I hate that. [minirantmode1]Why does everyone (including myself) always relate Wisconsin to effing CHEESE, BEER, and HARLEYS? Ok, I guess there's not really much else, but it gets effing annoying. I love cheese, but I hate beer  AND  Harleys. Harleys are loud, noisy, pollutiong hazards to the environment. During the Harley 100th Anniversary, seeing all those disgusting dirty biker fucks didn't help either.[/minirantmode1]     JOE ON HAVE A NICE DAY      Super Rad Joe : that it's H.A.N.D.

Someone needs to shut down the internet because it's not good while you're sitting online while you're bored. Hell, look at this blog entry. If you're actually reading this, please reply. I'd honestly like to know that someone cares. Thanks for reading, until next time (next time probably = in about 15 minutes)          Joe, the Sexy Beast
