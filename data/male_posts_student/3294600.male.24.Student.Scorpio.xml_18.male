The first letter pissed off the manager.  He read it, ripped it up, stuck the pieces in the envelope, and said, "I don't have to take this."  Dale brought it back to me and told me he didn't like that I had written some things about him (the management) breaking rules but expecting the tenants to obey them.  I also said they have poor customer service and don't follow-up with tenants requests.  After I calmed down, my friend Cliff told me I should have only given the 20 day notice and nothing further so I took the first paragraph of the first letter and gave that to him signed and dated.  I told Dave, the manager, that I'm sorry and I put things in there that I shouldn't have because I'm frustrated with Dale's parents and the way they are treating him.  I was almost in tears, but he accepted my letter, my handshake, and my apology.  So now maybe this won't go bad on my credit report.  I also received really bad news about a friend of mine, but really can't say much because they are not ready for people to know.  It's difficult for me because of everything going on this just adds one more thing.  I want to close with some good news...I submitted my mid-term for my web design course and since I wasn't in class, the instructor said, "I will provide you with a "strong hint"."  He went on to say, "Your good work would get a 95% as is. If you make the change indicated above, you could get a 100%."  Needless to say this afternoon I made the change and I'm assuming I now have 100% for my midterm.    My friends, family, and instructors have been so supportive of me during this whole challenging time in my life.  You will hear this a lot from me, I am truly blessed with the people in my life.  My Mom told me growing up, "You'll be lucky if you have one true friend in your life."  Well Ma, I have have so many more than that!  I have even more supportive acquaintances.  I may be not have a lot of money, but I am rich with love and support.
