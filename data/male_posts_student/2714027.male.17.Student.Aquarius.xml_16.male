Don't people have anything else better to do than create stupid viruses and spam them round the net? Sheesshh...  Anyway, today was a pretty crappy day; I woke up with a stomach ache and it continued to bug me throughout the day, so much that I went home from school at 11am. Time was not wasted though, as I managed to play a decent amount of  Urban Freestyle Soccer , which I'm currently reviewing. I'm pleased with the huge number of applications for moderator and developer positions at Clan Recruiter; it proves to me that it is indeed a great idea, something that people  want . Rock.
