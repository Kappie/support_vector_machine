If you are looking for fun silly topics turn back now.   How many guys have been attracted to women without any idea why.  The girl you are attracted to isn't better looking then the other girls and there isn't anything really physically different about them than anyone else yet there is something about them that catches your eye.  This intangable (sp?) quality is what I refer to as "The Spark."  "The Spark" is something you can only see when looking in a girls eyes.  It's a glow that you can catch burning from deep within their soul.  These women are totally unaware they have it.  They just think that men are drawn to them and don't even try to explain why.  These are the girls with inner beauty sometimes as well as outer beauty.  This confidence and personality that they have is unmistakable and most men can see they possess it.  Yet there is an anomaly about "The Spark."  The annomally is that "The Spark" sometimes appears differently to different people.  Some people call this types but I don't believe that.  I just think that there are different types of flames inside of people that burn at different intensities that others appreciate more.  Soem burn too bright and others too dim.  It's your own preference yet some have no spark at all.  These are sad folk that people can recognize almost instantaniously.  These sad cases settle for other non spark carrying folk or sometimes luck out and find someone who has that spark who can not find themselves anyone who recognizes it who they find acceptable.  The worst case though is those girls ( i say girls because that is the sex I can see "The Spark" in.  I'm sure this happens in both sexes) who's spark burns out.  I'm not going to say who I have seen do this because they might read this but buy me a few beers and I'm sure I will tell you.  Their is nothing sadder than a girl who is not only beautiful but glows from within because of a fire in her soul.  These girls who think lowly of themselves and let lesser men blow their spark away and turn them into shells of the person they were are the saddest beings on the planet.  Honestly nothing makes me feel worse about life than people such as these.  This is written to all these girls to remind them to keep the flame burning.  THe passion that fuels the flame is all you need.  Feed the fire and life will turn out ok.  If the fire dies out you will end up with an insurance salesman husband wondering how your life turned out the way it did.    This is not only an informative session about "The Spark" so that people know they have it but also advice to look for this passion burning in others.  This passion can light up a room and these are the people you want to be near for your lifetime.  A little advice from a failed romantic trying to find the things he's lost.  Sometimes I will find them but hopefully You will read this before you ever lose them.  Just something to keep in mind.  As always to end my writing I would like to quote a man, not just any man, but The Man for his time and place, Willie Nelson.                         How's your new love,                         I hope that he's doin' fine                         Heard you told him,                          That you'd love him till the end of time                         Well you know, that's the same thing                         that you told me                         Well it seems like just the other day                         Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away  Just a song that I love and reminds me a lot of life.
