Day was January 6, and I was so pumped, getting a chance to do something like this!  I thought it'd be great, the sweetest time of my life.  So as the game began, the nerves were kinda' getting to me, and I could hardly dribble properly, the floor was hard to get used to but that was no excuse for my play.  And I'm not talking about my play only, our team was horrible, they know that, I know that, but we just have to live with it now.  Despite an embarrassment at halftime with ourselves and our coach, we still kept playing like Kindergardners play tag, if that made any sense to you. (running around without a purpose is what i'm trying to say).  The final wistle sound, I CAN STILL HEAR it.  The thought of defeat, especailly to this team (I won't mention the reasons) was just unbearable.  It was sad guys!  I tell you, it's right up there to the defeat of Heritage Hall when I played for JV 3 years ago.  That's how bad it was.    Even when he kissed her, he was lookin' over starin at her sister (what a jerk huh?) .... Keep it real, I'm Will
