I was talking to him on ventrillo and we were going over what we should do when I come down to vist him for the first time In my life.  Well then he brought up something from germany when I was two.  The strange thing is i remember some things from germany even though I was only two and I told him about my memories.  I remembered the house and how it was shaped and I remember our nieghbors and how they would always pinch my cheeks to hard.  Then he brought up something about skating in front of the house and It poped into my mind what went on with skating in front of the house.  I remembered the color of my skates (blues and yellow) and I remember they shifted in size to adjust to people feet.  I remember how they buckled and I told my dad all of this.  He went silent the second I started to bring up the skates and I just kept going off on memories that I had from when I was two.  and I know they are true becuase he just busted down on vent apologizing to me.  this is actually the first time I never really got to witness any emotion or anything from him even though it was over vent.   I have to admit, no matter how strange it is and it showed he really does feel sorry for doing to me what he did.  This doesnt change shit, I'm not any more mad or any more happy about this.  It was just another one of thoes reality checks I get all the fucking time letting me know whats up. The only thing that sort of hurts is knowing I can remember all that stuff,  It makes me miss it and I want to go back and see what it was like but I never will be able to remember it all.  I'm going to call Bj, see if he wants to skate.
