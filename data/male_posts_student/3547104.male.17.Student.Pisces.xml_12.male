Woke up at 7 to take the fucking SATs (If the SATs are ever to be incarnated into a person, he/she should burn in hell for all eternity), and travelled to CV to take the test. Upon arrival, Erin and I socialized with the other Binghamtonians, and assessed the males from neighboring schools. Our observations helped us arrive at one conclusion: Chenango Forks is infested with beautiful guys. Hopefully hands on research will appear on the horizon sometime soon.  After the test, my mom took Erin home and drove my sis to the mall for her dress. When we reached our destination (Mandee), I wandered off and came across a gorgeous tan thing. The funny thing is he was wearing a CF sweatshirt (ERIN WE  ARE  RIGHT... FORKERS ARE HOTT!)) I also saw Rachel a.k.a. Lolita (I LOVE JEW!). I also unfortunately saw certain people who made we wanna throw up. I later found my mom and went home. Got home, signed on to AIM and had a nice conversation with a certain rower. Advice to everyone (THE 11th COMMANDMENT): If the person you sweat (and vice versa) asks you if you made out with anyone at a wet undergarment contest, the best answer is NO. Maybe this is something widely known to everyone except rowers. IDK. But I'm sure the rower's friend was ecstatic to hear such awesome news. Except... not really. (MACK MODE OFF!)
