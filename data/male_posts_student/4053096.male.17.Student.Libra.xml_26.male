I like it. We sang it like, a billion times. Ok, so maybe only thrice (that's fancy for three). It has a sad story behind it though. I had heard it before, but had forgotten about it. I would say it, but I don't really feel like typing that much right now. But yeah. After church my parents left me. I was ok with walking home; but Bon offered to take me home, so I couldn't turn her down: you know how that is,... well, maybe you don't. Anyways. Tomorrow I'm goin' shoppin' er somethin' of that sort with Bonny. I'm not too much into shopping, but I only have so much time with her before she leaves. Hey, shopping can be fun! Maybe I'll see something I need. hmm, is there anything that I need? I'm not too sure. I'd have to think a while and look at my wardrobe. I do want to see the price that trenchcoats are going for these days. I want one. I most likely won't be able to find one though, knowing my luck. Wait a second! I could get David a birthday gift! his birthday is only a few days away. But I'm not sure what he wants. I'll have to ask him. ... hmm, what would Dave want...? Well, I guess I'll find out tomorrow. Man, I can't believe he's going to be 16. He's going to be driving by himself within two weeks (provided he don't fail the drivers test). Anyway. I had best be off to bed. I have to go on a Z hunt. There's no better place than my lovely bed hunt down those Z's... man, why am I so weird? Maybe it's that I'm tired. Maybe not. Well, I'll go on that one for right now.
