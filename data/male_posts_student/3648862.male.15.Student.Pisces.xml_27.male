I figure that it’s now or never, so I am going to kiss him. But, my plan is falling apart. He was supposed to come over after marching band, well that’s been canceled. We can work around that though so it’s not a big deal. But today I found out that I might be going on vacation earlier than I thought, SOMETIME THIS WEEK! Tomorrow I will call Ryan and try to make plans for him to come up that day or the next day. Hopefully I can get him to come over, then I can kiss him and maybe even lose my virginity. :D   I will post the Third Part of “Confrontation” very soon. Sorry I am too lazy right now, I am tired. I haven’t got enough sleep in the last to days. It’s mostly due to Marching band and the fourth of July. Oh yeah I found this awesome yaoi website. It’s  urlLink www.yaoifan.net .  There’s a lot of yaoi pics and doujinshi. It’s a great site. That’s all the posting for now. TTYL
