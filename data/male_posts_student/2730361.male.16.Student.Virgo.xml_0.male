IT is about New york during the 1870's and it is trying to tell the story of a young man that is engaged to a young woman but whose engagment is propbably going to be broken up by the afore mentioned young woman's cousin. It is a story that uis deffinately not propperly represented by its title or the cover art and it is one great example of the old axiom "Do not judge a book by its cover". This book is one of the most boring stories i have ever read. I understand that my English teacher will read this but i dont care. I skipped whole pages of most of the 5 out of the 11 chapters we had to read and i didnt lose anything from the story. The whole story seems to be a fairly linear story with no side development and it is my only hope that the story will grow into a more developed story.
