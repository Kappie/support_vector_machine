I still don't know why I chose that school, I would have rather chose to go to a warm school somewhere in florida; oh well, i concern myself on how much college costs, and albany seemed to fit my cheap needs.  in english, me, grande smut, and tenacious smut (yud) are assigned to write a creative short story set in Shakespeare's time.  mrs bassani gave specific directions to follow and told us not to make it too unrealistic, but since me and kev and adam don't really care about our english grades, we decided to make it totally bogus about a man named God Zilla (son of Rod and Todd Zilla).  his enemy is the megazord and Lord Zedd.. and there's a whole lotta other dumb stuff in there, pretty funny. friday i'm going on a field trip to six flags for physics..  that will be fun, especially since i miss school.  we basically have to do about 30 minutes to an hour of lab-work which deals with the park's rides, and then we get to go off and do our own thing.  chris burgaleta will be in my lab group.  burguleta is such an amazing person to me.  i look up to him both literally and figuratively.  well, maybe just literally.  or maybe it's just because he can take such huge bong hits.  and whenever you make him laugh you feel good in the inside, like you're a really funny person.  i don't know. enough of my rant on chris. soon the college guys will be coming home; about two weeks.. that will be refreshing to see all of the guys together again, granted we all plan and get together.. not much else is new; i'm tired..
