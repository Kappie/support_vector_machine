BUT, what hurt MOST of all was when I fickin' broke my hand on Ervin, I tried to karate chop him during focus...and I actually think I broke my hand....boy does THAT suck. Then after focus, everyone was talkin' about how they were goin' to prom and it was all good, and I'm not.  So, that was mildly depressing, and I know I never intended on going, but...for like two weeks I did plan on going, but that fell through when Tina dumped me, so.....now I once again never intend on going.  It's still kinda sad though. Then I watched the koolest movie ever in Japanese kalled Water Boys...it was seriously HILARIOUS!!!  I absolutely loved it....even though I didn't understand most of it! Then in forth block I GOT TO SING JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT!!! Man that's awesome, I like that musical a butt-load....it was kool. Then I thought I was just gonna ride the bus home like every other day....and go to my house and be content just like every other day, oh....but THAT went down the shitter WAY fast..... As I went to get on the bus, I saw Ervin, who said he was going to my house, so..I was wondering what he was doin', seeing as he was sitting around talking to other people in the commons...and I was like "Ervin, are you goin' to my house or not?" and then he said sumthin' along the lines of, I'll get a ride later, and so I asked him who he was gettin' a ride from, and he said probably Brittany, so I said I would just get a ride too then.  So we went looking for Brittany, and we couldn't find her anywhere, so I said I would kill Ervin if he got us stuck at the High School, then we went downstairs a while later, and we found Brittany, and she was just talkin' to sum friends, so, we told her we were getting a ride to my house from her, and she said o.k.  But, I later found out that she was giving 3 other people rides home, too!  So.....it was gonna be rather crowded...and one of the people was Tina.  Whom still hasn't talked to me or tried to "make things better."  So, I knew that it was going to be rather awkward in that car.....luckily she got to sit in the front seat, and I got to sit in the back with Gloria, Ervin, and Tascha.....one of which has a boyfriend(Gloria) and the other two are going to prom together....so...once again...I feel rather out of place back there.....but I would have rather been back there then up front...where there was Tina and Brittany.  Ya, so...the entire I felt rather awkward....which is why I'm still pretty angry that I took that ride home instead of just riding the bus.    Also, before we left, Tascha was chasing me, and I was running fast, and I thrust my shoulder into a door trying to get it to open fast, but instead...I ended up shattering the glass.....so...I felt like a pretty big dumbass.  Either way, today made me feel rather unwanted....including Tina saying that she WAS gonna talk to me even though no one else was, and then she never did...so....ya......I'm scum.
