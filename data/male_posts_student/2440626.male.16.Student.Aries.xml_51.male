At lunch, Talia came over to me and said that she wanted to get Jared back for some April Fool's day joke.  So I was thinking, and I came up with a plan. So we went to visit Mrs. O, the english teacher, who Talia, Jared and I have 8th period. We explained to our plan and luckily, she agreed.  We were going to frame Jared for cheating on a fake pop quiz that Mrs. O was gonna give.  So, let's fast-forward to English class.  Mrs. O announces "Everyone clear there desks, we are having a pop quiz". The looks on our classmates' faces was priceless!  Anyway, about half way through the quiz, Talia, who sits right behind Jared, ( I sit right behind Talia), plants the cheat sheet under his desk.  Mrs. O walks over and picks it up. "Is this yours? I think you were cheating!" she says to Jared. "It's not mine, I swear!" Jared exclaims.  So at this point not only is the whole class taken-aback by the pop quiz, but Jared was sweating bullets!  At the end of the class, Mrs. O called Jared up to her desk.  She was filling out a slip for a week of detention!  Jared was panicking!  Finally, after the afternoon announcements, Talia and I come clean about the prank.  The whole class was relieved that the quiz wouldn't count and Jared was dumbfounded that we pulled off such a great prank. What a great day!
