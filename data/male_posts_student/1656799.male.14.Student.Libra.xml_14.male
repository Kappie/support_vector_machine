Recommend it to anyone, currently on sale in HMV or £6, so get it whilst its cheap.   Was given £10 from my mum and nan today, which confused me but I'm not really complaining, so its a journey into town tomorrow to spend it on more cds.   Started a new blog, as the basis of a bet with James, which you can find  urlLink here.    Check that out, bookmark it, and come back soon for updates.   Short entry I know, but I haven't much interesting to say, so I'm saving you random rabble.   Ciao.
