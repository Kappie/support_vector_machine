We all love you, Burnie.  -  Oi, I snuck out of my house at about 12 last night and got some snackage at the MinuteMart up the street a ways.  Good bike ride.  Some scary old dude, possibly freeloader, possible just eccentric, very creepy.  He kept telling me to come over to where he was.  So, naturally, I sprayed him with mace and then ran.  Nah, just shook my head and tried to be non-confronting.  It was very nice outside.  65 degrees or so.  Odd breeze.  Very different.  Felt good.  It took an hour, and I almost got caught doing it.  Totally worth it anyway.  -  I'm pissed that I was a week off in my mind.  Dammit, this was supposed to be spring break!!!  Ah, well, no problem I guess.  I hate doing group projects, and it seems like every teacher wants to do it now.  It's so fucking annoying.  I work much more efficiently alone.  That is the sole reason I hate Algebra class, Mr. Morris keeps forcing me to work with my teammates.  They're fine on their own!  When they need help, they ask me.  Simple!  I don't need to go through every single problem with them.  None of us want to!  ARRRGHH.  Okay, steam blown off there, felt good.  -  Smooth move on my part, I wore a black shirt today.  It was like a fucking oven!  That shirt came off fast when I got home.  Not very sexy.
