This dude my friend is seeing sounds like he is trying to be a man-whore. She's never given me a good impression of him from how she describes him (I've never met him), but this really makes me annoyed. She deserves so much better.  I hope my friend is alright. I'll give her a call later this week.  I feel lazy  **
