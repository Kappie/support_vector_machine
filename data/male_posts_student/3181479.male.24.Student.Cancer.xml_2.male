One of the first scenes of the show was in a free clinic in Cairo.  A woman brings her son in for some simple, easily treatable disease, but because the clinic lacks the money to buy simple antibiotics, her son dies.  Then, as it turns out, the doctor heading the clinic is a terrorist (you might say it was a terrorist hospital), and some woman who I think was his sister tries to talk him out of going to his terrorist meetings.  He says he can't stop going to them, because that would be abandoning his faith, and he can't do that.  After that, the doctor's next patient is someone very high-ranking in a major terrorist organization.  The doctor tells this patient that he just had a boy die for lack of antibiotics, and the terrorist big-wig offers the doctor antibiotics if he would join his terrorist club.  The big-wig also mentions during this conversation that he has safehouses from Cairo to Beirut in a manner that suggests that that was supposed to be impressive.  Let's count the problems with this:      Hospitals, even free ones, in Arab countries are now apparently terrorist establishments.  So next time American warplanes bomb the shit out of a hospital in Baghdad, it's OK, because hospitals are terrorist establishments, and killing terrorists and bombing their buildings is OK.  I'm not aware of that having happened yet, but Israel does regularly bulldoze random people's houses with the only justification being that they were used for cover by militants.  Which is basically equivalent to saying that a firefight took place near there.  Have you ever seen a World War II or Vietnam movie where all American troops strictly avoid using local buildings and structures for cover from enemy fire at all times?     Hospitals could very well be funneling money into terrorist organizations.  So it's perfectly fine to freeze the assets of the Holy Land Foundation, which claims to use its money to feed children, because they just have to be funneling money to Al-Qaeda on the side.  (HLF does funnel money to suicide bombing in a sense, since they provide food to orphans, and the children of suicide bombers, strangely enough, tend to be orphans.  This is all the HLF has ever been publicly accused of doing.)  Charities of any sort run by Arabs are assumed to be funneling money to terrorists until proven otherwise, and this show is helping to fuel that.     The show frames the debate over terrorism among Muslims as one between those with strong faith who are in favor of terrorism and those who are more secularized who are against terrorism.  One example is when the doctor's sister says nothing to her brother's objection that he "cannot abandon his faith" when she asks him to stop going to terrorist meetings.  This is done throughout the show in other contexts as well.  In reality, there are  urlLink well-respected Islamic scholars  who say that  urlLink terrorism is not permissible .  Suicide in general is  urlLink strongly condemned  in the Islamic scriptures.  Of course, you don't see any of this in "The Grid."  All you see is some random redneck's view of Arabs.  Which brings me to my next point...     Cairo and Beirut are not very far apart.  The terrorist big-wig talked about having safehouses all the way from Cairo to Beirut as being some sort of huge accomplishment.  I can't see how it would be, except that Israel happens to be in the middle.  In any case, this guy is supposed to be one of the world's biggest terrorists, so he really ought to be able to have safehouses from Morocco to Malaysia.  How is this propaganda, you ask?  Well, it isn't.  But to me, it indicates that the people who wrote that part of the script  have no idea where Cairo and Beirut are .  They're just rednecks, and now they're responsible for telling what I'm afraid is a significant chunk of the American population everything they know about the whole Arab world.    I'm still deciding whether this show is worse than "Pearl Harbor" with Ben Affleck.
