Dear Editor, 	I referred to the letter “Aims of today’s feminists are misguided” by Ms Divya Sangameshwar (Today, March 11). I agree with the writer to a certain extent on the state of gender relations in our time and society. However, I feel that the writer has mis-interpreted the aims of the feminist movement. True, the original aim of feminism was to create an egalitarian society as well as greater recognition and rights for women around the world. While how successfully these objectives have been achieved since the heyday of feminism in the 1960s is arguable, it is clear that the landscape of our society has changed thanks to the feminist movement. 	  The writer stated that how the world with 50 per cent women cannot be considered as a “world of men”. But I believe that population cannot be equated with the influence of women in the world. Even more so, if 50 per cent of the human population were women, why are we only seeing a miniscule fraction of women involved in spheres of social, political and economic influence? This can be very much reflected in the gender make-up of the UN general, security assembly as well as the birth-place of modern feminism, the USA, which has not had a woman president, despite more traditional societies such as Indonesia and the Philippines which have seen women taking up the premiership.   What the writer said about men waiting for wives to bring home the bacon, “not without facing ridicule”, is not the result of the feminist movement, but rather such a notion is nothing short of patriarchal and has nothing to do with feminism at all. It would be highly inaccurate to say that our society has totally fulfilled the objectives of feminism. The reason why people view a man waiting for his wife to bring home the bacon as “shameful” is still because that people view traditional feminine roles as being inferior to masculine ones. This can be seen all the way to fashion, it is not uncommon to see women clad in t-shirt and jeans, but it would be highly unlikely that a man appear in a skirt. While feminism has enabled women the freedom to take on masculine roles, it has not won in the battle for minds, and has yet to mould our society into one where both gender roles are viewed as equals.  In the context of gender roles, I believe that feminism has never meant to abolish these essential roles, and neither does feminism seek to reverse traditional gender roles. Feminism is about perfectly inter-changeable gender roles for individuals, both men and women; it is all about the freedom of choice. For example, a working mother may exercise her more masculine traits in the workplace, while she chooses to take on the nurturant, feminine role at home. Even among male, single, working, parents, the situation is no different, and around us in our society we can see people having inter-changeable gender roles regardless of their sex. While it would be unthinkable to brand these people as “bi-sexual”, this was very much the case (maybe not to that extent) before feminism made its voice felt among the developed world.  The writer also stated that feminism should protect the rights for maids, in the local context. However, I believe that any government organization would be able to do the job. While feminism in the 60’s fought the battle against outright and blatant discrimination against women, I believe that the battle for feminists now is sublime, and underground. The battle is for minds and the redefinition of social norms. Someone once said, “I do agree with feminism, its simply feminists whom I got a problem with”. While I admit the behaviour and beliefs of certain feminists can be socially destructive, we should never abandon and overlook the bottomline of the feminist movement, which is simply equality and recognition for both men and women.
