Great fight scenes and some interesting humor throughout. What ticked me off though was that at Regal they tried to card me infront of the theatre. I just said I was with the guys in front of me and no harm done but the principle of the thing. anyways yes I apologize to my loyal READER for not updating more. been getting killed by AP english.
