I personally think it is stupid to buy a cell phone for more than CDN $500. I can buy a digital camera AND a cell phone with that price.     I haven't started my molecular biology readying since I came back from Japan. My god, I have lots to catch up. The conversation with Debby today was pretty fun. Can you believe that Debby told me to treat my ex better!! I am so happy to have a friend like her than my ex, Edith, who is a bitch. Oops.... I guess I haven't got over with that relationship yet...     2:33, time to sleep
