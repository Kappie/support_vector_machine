For the last few weeks so many things have reminded me of you guys, for example just before I wrote this I watched a movie (Love Actually) which  I saw with one of you guys and I remember so many things about what we talked about, did and though before,after and in the middle of the film. Also I havent got anyother background on my computer than you guys and all the lovely (am I also getting more British by the minute) pictures Walker has posted. I cant wait to see you all again and I cant understand why there isnt anybody willing to pay for the plane tickets.  Hope I see you (in person) soon, Ãšlli  p.s. Note that I did put a link to the penguin game, just my version ;)    ... Try your luck now Timmy Tim
