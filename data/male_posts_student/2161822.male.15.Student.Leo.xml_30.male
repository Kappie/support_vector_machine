But then in an hour it all melted so whatever. You're in Hazleton. Remember the snow is always blacker and dirtier here than _(insert place here)_. Yesterday I went to Allentown with my family to waste some Christmas money. I think there are as many thugs and gangters walking around the Allentown mall as there are gothics and punks in the Laurel Mall. It was nice and crowded too. Just the way I hate it. As if I don't hate shopping the way it is, yesterday I had to wait in lines 10 people deep just to buy a pack of gum. But hey. It's the holidays what can you expect, right? I love on TV how many stupid things they air. Like the National Scrabble Championship or the Chess Tournament or all those stupid infomercials for knives(sadly I watched every re-run of these). Who in their right mind would want to watch two 50 year old men take 15 minutes each to form a word out of the letters "s, d, a"? Not my idea of fun.  Listen to H.I.M.
