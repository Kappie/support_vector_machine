Dont get me wrong but this is what has been said about the film:   "The gossip site(  urlLink aint it cool news )says that the film adaptation (of The Green Lantern)is being described as a "crazy and zany film" and will be in the realm of Jim Carrey's "The Mask." The site also says that DC Comics is objecting to this approach but that Warner Bros. has the final say."   This just dissapoints me, The Green LAnturn has always been my fave superhero, and Now Warner Bros. is going to degreade his persona, oh how the mighty have been tripped and have fallen...
