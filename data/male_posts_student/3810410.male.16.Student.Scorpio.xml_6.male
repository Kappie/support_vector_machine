My act has become overused This worn-out mask I wear is growing thin I think I should go But that face you give It keeps me in my place And I give in with no trace of deception Seemed she never wanted me at all Seems the finer things she required All the gems that couldn’t buy her Were they put to good use? Or did she use them like she used me? Let’s forget tonight Leave this all behind Start over new, fresh and reborn But are growing into break ups? My act has become overcharged You never gave me the benefit of the doubt I never wanted out, but you seemed to have changed Let’s rearrange our settings But I’m betting you’re not thinking the same She never wanted me at all Seems the finer things she required All the gems that couldn’t buy her Were they put to good use? Or did she use them like she used me? Did she use them like she used me? (I’m on her string) Did she use them like she used me?
