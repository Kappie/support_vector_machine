Time to start a diet high in sugar, salt and water - apparently that's the best way to deal with it.  Better than going to a doctor anyway.  I hate doctors.  I absolutely hate them (btw the previous bit was not just made up to go on a rant about doctors, I genuinely do think I have low blood pressure).  They seem to be utterly useless.  When I completely fucked up my leg a while ago I had to go to a doctor (torn muscle, put me out for 3 weeks).  Did she give me a crutch to help me walk?  Hell, no.  She just overprescribed Neurofen.  I didn't need painkillers, because I could handle the pain.  I didn't even need paracetemol.  (Apparently Neurofen is a muscle relaxant as well - that would have been useful.  Couldn't she have given me the muscle relaxant without the painkiller?)  So anyway, a crutch would have been really nice.  But no, just prescribe painkillers for everything.  Oh well, I did go and collect the prescribed Neurofen for the hell of it, so I now have an unused box of it ready to sell on the black market.  Anyone want it?  And similarly, if I go to a doctor now and say I have slighly low blood pressure (because it is really a minor thing, it only occurs when I first stand up after a long period of lying down; I don't randomly faint) they're probably going to prescribe something like heroin to get my heart beating faster again... no thanks.  I'll stick to self-diagnosis with the help of friends and the internet until something serious happens.  In fact, on a complete tangent, something weird did happen the other day.  I found a tiny little thing under the skin on my leg.  Only about the size of the full stop.  I very un-surgically removed it with my pen-knife.  It was black, and looked much like a tiny pebble.  But it was soft.  Very weird, thought at the time it might be a cancer or something.  Still, it hasn't come back.  Me and my penknife: 1, Doctors: 0.  :D  Screw them.
