I was thinking about theology and how, while it's fascinating and useful and all that, is an extremely limited venture because we can't comprehend God. We can hardly deal with the information he has explicitly told us. Anyway, I had this sudden thought about how Godmight view theology. I thought of a bunch of people (mainly nerdy men with specs) arguing about how what they believed was really the truth. They all had in their hand a little piece of a model car, and they all swore that their piece was the only one worth anything. While God is watching this, he looks over at the actual car that represents the truth: complete,with all the bits and pieces that the men were squabbling over. Then he looks back over at the separate partsheld bythe men, who arescreaming thatthe one they have isthe entire car. This is where God gives a shake of his head, butloves them for trying to understand. Is it weird that symbolism naturally yet consciously appears in my thought processes? Truth as a car? So anyway, the point is that we can all only grasp some small idea of God. The key is to recognize this fact and avoid the arrogance that would stem from claiming that I have the only piece of the model. Someday we'll see the whole car, even though, right now, we can't even begin to envision what a car would look like.
