Other Lesson of the Week: With legal defintions of torture in continual flux, it must be an awesome time to be a psychopath.  Like a Renaissance of sorts, since you could come up with totally off-the-wall, evil stuff and it might not be degrading enough to actually count as evil stuff.    Other Other Lesson of the Week: Even with serious political scandals involving outting CIA operatives and violating international treaties- scandals emerging during an election year, no less- the media choose to focus on Bill Clinton and his penis.  Where did his penis really go?  What happened when he told his wife what his penis did?  It's all so important... maybe the NY Times ought to run a front-page review of his memoirs.  Oh wait, they totally did even after apologizing for being weak-minded, lazy schmucks before the Iraq war.  I guess our priorities are in order.  Just not an order where we, like, put the critical issues at the top.    And that's really my problem here.  It's cool if we collectively decide that it's ok to torture; or that's it's ok to lie and manipulate language even though you promised to be an honest, plain-talkin' President (example: contacts between Iraq and al-Qaeda no longer mean actual contacts; just meetings).  But we haven't made those decisions yet because we haven't really talked about them.  We're still stuck on Clinton's penis.    Also irritating: we spent a week flying a corpse from coast to coast, worshipping it as though a god had died.  Let's get some perspective here.  Reagan supported the Taliban because it was fighting the Soviets, and he supported Saddam Hussein because Iraq was battling Iran.  He sure as hell didn't do anything to stop either of them when they were in their incipient, easier-to-defeat forms.  So basically the major problems we're currently facing- the ones with armies and deaths and bombs, at any rate- were caused by a man we just spend millions of dollars to bury.  I can't be the only one bothered by that.  And I can't be the only one who wishes the media would have picked up on that.  And I can't help but wonder if Bill Clinton and his penis will get the same treatment some day down the line.  That'll be the ultimate test of American ideals, won't it?  We can forgive/forget Iran-Contra, breaking unions, firing air traffic controllers.  If we can't forgive/forget what Clinton and his penis did...that'd be sad.
