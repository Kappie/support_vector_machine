I managed to break a string on my guitar, so I'm gunna replace them all, I think it's still the same set I started with, they so crap and old it's just not funny, luckily I already had a spare set in case of said event.  Saturday, Charl came round and we (inc. Dave obv) had tea, then played video games, then went to the Tate Modern, and met Alice on the way. We spent a silly ammount of time in the mirror-ceiling-light-hall place, it was cool. Then we met Alex Bate randomly in Victoria Station, he'd just had a panic attack, but was recovering when we met him, but he seemed alright, which was good. Then Alice came round afterwards and we listened to the Crazy Gods Of Endless Noise, oh the funk, and drank tea at the same time.  And today was my sister's birthday party - which means 13 13 year old screaming girls running around my house - Me and Dave tried to escape the house, but our attempt failed, no place to go to that we could be arsed to go to. We had to stay in this room all day and play Civ 3, at least I'm king of the world.. I must go, got to see Cruel Intentions, sweet.  *salutes*
