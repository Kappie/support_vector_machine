Eric Bana to be  urlLink the next 007 ?  New  urlLink iPods ! Tim has one, and I am having major iPod lust  and  jealousy!     I am not a very good rocket scientist. Our launcher is great - except for the fact that the air-in hole is to close to the water-in hole and never gets to the rocket. Meh!     I continue to be single. I don't like it much at all.     I am going to fail English this term unless I write a 3 minute monologue as Denny from  urlLink Educating Rita .  I got my computer back! With new RAM and a new motherboard. My second hard disk was fried, so I lost all my web designs and music and downloads and games. Meh, nothing that can't be replaced. Just have to download. Lots!   Tara - STOP READING!  I have just realised Aaron is amazingly good looking. He might not be everyone's cup of tea, but hey! He's mine *gay!*. Um, yeah.  TARA - CONTINUE READING!  Tim's also pretty good looking - he has nice legs!     ... I just realised how gay that sounds. Let's hope this doesn't get into the wrong hands...        And that's it. Consider yourself updated on Adam's life!
