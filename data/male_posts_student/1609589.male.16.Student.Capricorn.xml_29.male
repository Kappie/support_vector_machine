Then i had to sit there. for 8 HOURS listening to NOTHING but dog training. How do these people do it? It's an ANIMAL, it doesnt need to goto 8 hours of school!  Grr, i don't wanna talk about it... I don't wanna see another dog for a while.. even though i have to do the same thing again tomata. I get a hundred bucks for helping out tho so its worth it.  You know who's voice i wish i had? Sam Fisher, from Splinter Cell. Damn, that voice was cool. It's the only cool and dark and brooding voice... that was voiced by a white guy. Ever. It's something to strive for. That guy has something.  Dangit, it's 7 already?!?!? I can't take a nap now! Oh well, just 3 more hours. No wait, it's 7:45, so it's closer to 8! 2 more hours! No, wait! Time is accellerating at a faster speed than normal?!?! It's 10?!?!?! Well then, I'm going to bed. See ya!  Notttt really. I haven't even gotten any of that pizza yet. In fact, it seems like pizza time for me right now. I'll post back l8r when i remember what i was gonna put in this thing today.
