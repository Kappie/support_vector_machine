I personally use Gaim but its not as full featured as trillian and might be a little hard for some people out there. (there are a lot of Pantuoscos) Well for trillian there is a free version but if you want ill hook you up with the pro version (save 25 bucks) or go with Gaim totally free and open source.     Where to download-    Trillian-   (http://www.trillian.cc/downloads/)  Gaim-  (http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gaim/gaim-0.80.exe?download)
