So anyway, I went out, bought Striker, came home, had a bath, then went out.... with guess who? Gemma and Paul. So anyway we just had a chat, which mostly involved me and Paul lecturing Gemma on Jeremy. He's hanging out with us on Monday, so I get to meet him formally for the first time. Ugh. I don't want to associate with people like that. Paul kept bringing up the fact that he's a bad guy, and Gemma said she just wants a bit of fun, so Paul said 'Bad guys always get nice girls, why don't you have a bit of 'fun' with me or Jack?'. D'oh. I wish.  Somehow we ended up talking about ears, and Gemma mentioned that she loves biting and licking earlobes softly..... okay, I thought, but she did it to me and .... well, it's orgasmic. Holy shit it's good. Screw sex, I'm just going to sit there biting and licking earlobes for the rest of my life. Seriously, it's fucking good.  Apart from that I haven't done much, me and Gemma are going to a party tomorrow night, so I'll no doubt update you on Saturday, so until then, bye bye :)       Jack
