      Yo yo yo, this is a banner fucking day in the weblog, when I post twice in a row with out Nick to buffer things out with a little bit of sense. Not that I have anything entirely interesting to say, but I'll post some rambledambles. I saw the Bourne Supremacy last night. Apparently the first movie didn't stick with me that much, because I really didn't care about any of the characters in this one, as they didn't build any of them back up. Really boring. Plus there was the preview for a new great movie coming out called "Paparazzi." The plot is this actor gets really rich and famous, and then the paparazzi start hanging out all the time and taking his picture. Well you know what? He has had enough, and decides to take matters into his own hands. I say it's about time the actors struck back. How long have we, the public, been giving them so much shit and millions of dollars, and they have just been silent? Yeah, we deserve it. Not that I agree with paparazzi, but give me a break. It's like the actors all just decided to get together and hatch a way to get the public on their side. Well, I'm not going to feel sorry for these whiny millionaires. This is a movie? I've seen better film on teeth, to quote Get Shorty. It's produced by Mel "Bloody Jesus" Gibson. Nice follow up, jackass. Michael Moore was on O'Reilly the other night. It was hilarious. Like a couple of brat kids just screaming their sound bites at each other.   I was with a friend who got pulled over yesterday by campus cops. What a bunch of cowboy assaholics. First off he took 15 minutes running my friends license, since I guess he got stuck with the old car with the telegraph machine inside, and then he told my friend the reason he was pulled over was because he had a brake light out, and gave him an $80 ticket. When we checked later it was one of the little side lights. Agh! Why won't cops ever  help  me out? They always just cause problems. Anyway, enough negativity for one night. Peace to the East.
