But it can be quite busy and I've spent most of this evening doing more work for it to add to it tomorrow, I fear I might get it done faster than expected and so receive a pay cut as I will have been working less hours...  Anyway as I have been at a computer all day and evening I'll be off now so this is only a short posting... Ciao!
