Anyway, I'm not joining ADS anymore, mainly because I'm too sick to do the interview tomorrow and because of several "signs" telling me not to join�too bad, sayang ang one hundred bucks but anyway, I've already made my mind up�not to join, besides ADS might consume a lot of my time and its good to keep my life simple�I have Gabay naman eh�  	There�I'm actually glad that Ateneo is doing well in the UAAP, not that I am actually interested in basketball or anything but I keeps my spirit high�hehehe�parang it gives us, Ateneans, bragging rights�hehehe�  	Also, I'm actually regretting the fact that I went home early from my cousin's debut yesterday�*this was not in my previous post*�kasi I didn't make the most out of the party�for me "making the most" out of something is enjoying it to best extent possible�siguro it was because I was with my mother and sister and it felt kinda awkward if I do the stuff I do in most parties I attend�although, they were sitting at the tables area and I was at the landing of the stairs near the dance floor�  	I do hope BJ already uploaded and sent me the pictures of the party so I can have some nice stuff to put on my website�I have no means of checking as I can not open the Yahoo WAP site using GPRS, damn it! So I can only check my mail on the pc�anyway, there�I have a lot of reasons to be pissed off�plus I am sick and I don't know what format Gimo wants for citing online sources�  	I do hope that MLA stuff can be found in the net, otherwise, I'll be going to class with a wrongly formatted bibliography�kasi naman, Gimo made us look for that "MLA Handbook" in the library where anyone could have taken it�well, it could not be taken home as it was in the reference section but anyone has access to it so I don't think many people from my English class got hold of it�maybe Rina or someone else from my English class who is industrious enough got it�well, maybe no one did�  	The way I write now is actually very similar to how Jerome David Salinger narrates in the Catcher in the Rye using Holden Caulfield's first person point of view�hehehe�I'm anticipating a Lit quiz tomorrow�I do hope I do fine though�My two quizzes each a rated a 9/10 (B+) and a 5/10 (D) so my class standing is somewhere in between, maybe a C+ and I have to get something higher than that�  	I also hope that I did fine with our recent AutoCAD exercise�the last mark I got was an 8/10 (B)�not bad but I could have gotten something higher�I do hope I do well in the next exercises�so there�  	On shifting, I was kinda thinking about shifting to the Physics-Materials Science and Engineering program instead of staying at my Physics-Applied Computer Systems program�well, basically�I'm considering it thinking that programming stuff is hard, and judging from my performance in AutoCAD, I might not do that well�but if I shift to the materials science and engineering program, which is more of chemistry and physics stuff�I stand a better chance of scoring good marks�its not actually paranoia or ka-OC-han in my part�I just want to be assured�that's all�  	Anyway, the two programs are still Physics courses�um, magkaiba lang ng flavor�so there�pero thinking of the job opportunities, Physics-ACS is better�"big bucks"�according to Patrick E�hehehe  	So I've come to this conclusion, I will shift only after the basic course in programming (CE 21)�if I find it nice and easy, I will stay�if I find it kinda difficult, I will shift in to Physics-MSE�  	So there�  	--Logged Out--
