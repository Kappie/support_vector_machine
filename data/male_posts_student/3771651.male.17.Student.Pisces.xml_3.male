       
      Back in school after 4 days of rest. Today I heard rumours from my friend that I was  chosen for the 'Student Leadership Experience' camp. I think it will be fun because I can get to know more people. I still am not familiar with all the year one's yet but I hope to know everyone soon enough. My job is to make sure I know all their names so that we can get along as friends under one flag, the MI flag. It has been three months since I started breakdancing and I know a few moves but I hope to become a pro in two or three years.
