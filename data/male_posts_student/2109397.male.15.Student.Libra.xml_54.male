Everyone is having fun over there and i'm stuck in the Eastside at BALLARD which stands for sucky ass preppy rich school that is dark and dungeon like and everyone smokes pot.  Which gets me to my next point. That kid, who I passionately dislike ratted a buncha ppl out...or did he. It was leaked to the school that he told on a crap load of people when only he told on 2. He told me this in an IM and I asked my friend how much of it was the truth, because he was there and he said none. Well apparently the kid that ratted told abuncha other ppl his little story and they believed it. Originally this summer was going to be full of his ass kickings and now a lot less people are going to kick his ass. Which sux because I might hafta get my lazy ass up and do it for myself. In our little IM he told me to go out and make the A team. And that was pretty hypocritcal considering he was cut from the exact same team. Stupid faggot. He said all this shit about how he would ride me out and that I used to b a friend or something. I thought " Are you kidding me? You're the one who ditched me for a buncha people for no apparent reason. You're a wannabe, a fucking poser, you do drugs so you can fit in with every fucking crowd at Ballard, which totally backfired especially considering all you ever do is annoy people. NEWSFLASH: no one actually likes you we just put up with you. Now you know that I don't like you and nothing has made me happier this week. I just wish you didnt have the ability to lie the way you do, thats another thing, I really dont remember one thing that came out of his mouth being truthful. Everything was some sort of gossip, drugs, brag, or lie. The kid can't have an intelligent conversation with anyone. I honestly do not think I have had a more pure hatrid for anyone in my life, that IM was the best thing that could have happened, even if it ends up with im saying shit about me or wutever and turning people against me, it wont matter because he knows I hate him and he wotn be bugging me EVER AGAIN!  MY MOM WILL NOT QUIT TALKING TO ME, she needs to stop telling me to do stuff, or else I wont do it.  I think I have more stuff to rant about, but for now I feel alright enough.
