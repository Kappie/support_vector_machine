If I don't see another triangle in my life it won't be a bad thing.   I had my German reading and writing exams today. I think I did alright. No worse than a B, surely. I think I did pretty well in physics and chem, I hope...!  I'm working on my english assignment now. It's slowly taking shape. Well, it's only notes (coz we aint allowed to use a full script :|).   Ooh, Ellie just called me and told me what to prepare for German speaking tomorrow. Great stuff, hey... :|  Um, yeah. THats about it.  Oh, a paradox: You buy 100 kilos of potatoes and are told that they are 99% water. After leaving them outside, you discover that they are now 98% water. The weight of the dehydrated potatoes is then a surprising 50 kg! Gimme proof, baby! (I'll post it tomorrow, if I remember)
