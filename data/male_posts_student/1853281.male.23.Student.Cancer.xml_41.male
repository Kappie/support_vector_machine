Put away all the clothes scattered in my room, ditto with the three glasses and the 15 books. Do some dishes, read a chapter for school, make breakfast and pack a lunch and still have time to get myself pretty and ready for the day. All before 9:20 am. Scary. Other news. I am going to the dentists on friday so that they can look at my scary gum thing. I don't know what happened, but my cheek is starting to swell, and it is starting to hurt pretty much all the time. Time i got it looked at i think. wish me luck on my midterm tonight cheers devin
