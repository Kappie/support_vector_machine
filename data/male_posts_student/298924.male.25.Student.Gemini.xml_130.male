I've never been to New York....closest I've gotten is getting onto the wrong train in Baltimore (New York bound when I was actually headed to Washington)....well I've been giving serious thought to heading to New York for this Morehouse/Spelman Alumni party....we shall see very soon....  In other news, the word on the street is that I am teetering very close to being fired from one of my jobs....what scares me is that I really don't care at this point....I'm sure there will be more to say about this whole saga very soon....  I have eaten more free food today than the law should allow....got me a nice western omelet from the hospital (BANGING), a chicken snack with beans and some potato salad that I didn't eat, some pizza, and a portion of a sub sandwich, not to mention the Rice Krispie treat....yummie yummie....  Last night I attended a Kegger thrown by one of my great classmates, Sean.....I hit the keg hard and fast....when I got home my head was swimming....I thought I was gonna call my ole friend Earl.....but that leads me to another point....why is it when you get drunk you just go through your call list and just call people at random?....I woke up this morning and a friend asked me why I called and told her I was in NY and the Statue of Liberty was moving....I think there should be a law about drunk people and cell phones....like a breathalizer in the speaker end or something to prevent semi retarded people like myself from making as ass of themself....
