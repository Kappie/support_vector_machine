We learned a little bit about making a program idiot proof using the VaL() command and we learned a little bit about some syntax errors and logic errors.  A few things about inheritance and the all lovable class.  All in all I would say it was a good night for learning.  We are starting to get into some new things which is always cool.  Makes class a little harder but at least I know my massive amounts of loans are going to good use right ;)  So I'll leave you with a sucky joke: Why don't canibals eat clowns?     They taste funny!
