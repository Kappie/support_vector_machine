My day's not too shabby so far.  I feel like bein a bum, so here I am.  Sitting on my ass eating a bowl of Rice Chex... mmmmmm  I'm thinking about making up a website somewhere... probably geocities... and hosting a blog there instead of here, so I might just do that this summer.  Ah can't wait till school's out.  Well I'm outta here... it's so boring around here.   Grrr.  Currently Listening to: "Smashed into Pieces" - Silverstein  _TB
