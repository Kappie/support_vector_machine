Looking down at the floor, he let his eyes wander a bit before focusing on two exquisitely shaped feet in light blue flip-flops.  They looked like they had been recently washed, not having the dust or soot that envelope most toes exposed to a humid summer day in the city.  As he was about to shift his attention he noticed that the woman was stretching her toes out and relaxing them.  Larry smiled a bit as he thought how strange it was that someone would randomly be stretching their toes; then again he thought, not many people would take notice of these insignificant happenings in life.  He looked up at the woman and saw that she was happily talking on her cell phone.  Larry wondered if the woman knew what her toes were doing while she was conversing.  The bell sounded and the number 11 started to blink.  Larry quickly walked over to window 11.  "Can I have one stamp?” Larry asked as he flashed a smile.  "Sure, that'll be thirty-seven cents.” replied the postal worker returning the smile.  As Larry put his change on the counter with one hand he picked up the stamp with his other.  "Thanks so much.” said Larry.  As Larry was about to turn around and walk away, the postal worker pulled out an AK-47 attack rifle and shot Larry.  Larry died instantly.  The End
