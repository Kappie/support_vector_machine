We went to his cousin's pool yesterday and he slept over my house, this time, ironically, I was the one that couldn't fall asleep. Today we pranked a few people, fun. I'm so used to going to bed 3 in the morning. Well tonight I'm going to bed in 5 minutes which is 12. Early for me... uh... just before I was at my sister's dance recital. I sat next to my cousin Alexa by ourselves because tickets next to our parents were already sold and we decided to go later on after they purchased the tickets. It was funny, Alexa was so loud, everyone around us was probably so mad at us both. It was so funny though, we were barely paying any attention to the recital the whole time. Oh yea, today me and Kaiser went around the neighborhood with walkie talkies for no good reason and met up at Cheyanne's house. We were going to plan an attack but decided to stay out of trouble. On Monday, I don't think I did anything. Probably hangin out with Keith B tomorrow. Ok Goodnight.
