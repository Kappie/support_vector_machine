I have a feeling it will be a very painful experience. I am worried... deep inside about what will happen. I know the days are marching closer to Aug. 29-31 when possible a million people will be protesting against the convention.   I think what I am trying to say is I don’t know what will happen in the upcoming month… how else will I be changed? What will I see? Where will I go while I am in NYC? Who will I meet? What will I feel? As always I am greedy for life and cannot wait to experience the New York night…  My thoughts are consumed not by the present, but by worries and hopes of the future. In that vain, I cannot find words right now that can express my concerns for tommorow...
