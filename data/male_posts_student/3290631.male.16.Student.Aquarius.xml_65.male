However, even a score of 100% does not mean that your views are all shared by this faith, or vice versa.  Belief-O-Matic then lists another 26 faiths in order of how much they have in common with your professed beliefs. The higher a faith appears on this list, the more closely it aligns with your thinking.  1. 	Secular Humanism  (100%) 2. 	Unitarian Universalism (99%) 3. 	Liberal Quakers (85%) 4.
