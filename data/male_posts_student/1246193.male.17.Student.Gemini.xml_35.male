I feel bad for disliking these certain people so much, I really haven't given them a chance.  There are just people that I meet and my brain instantly tells me that you don't like them. Anyway...  I don't know what to blog about.  I have no inspiration.  I really hope this is a blog that people occasionally enjoy reading.  I apologize that the last few blogs have sucked.  I will rally and hope for a good blog in the next few days.
