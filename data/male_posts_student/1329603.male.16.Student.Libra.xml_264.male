Taking-the-biscuit. 1, you have to pay to be able to do anything just about; 2, those people who decide to pay a lot can stop you from talking to someone; 3, you have to pay to even be able to read the mail you get sent. Hate. I'm mm089, by the way.  I was completing a form yesterday (not one for facebattle) and it had a 'Marital Status' question. I figured that I didn't fit any of them - the usuals were there, 'Single and not looking', 'Single and looking', 'dating', 'long-term relationship', 'married' and 'divorced'. For one thing, why is divorced one? It's like if you're divorced, you can only be with divorced people, and that you're a member of a special 'divorced' club. What a question. Anyway, the real thing is that, when I really think about it, I don't fit into any of them - I'm 'single and letting things slide'. I put 'Single and looking'. I'm not just letting things slide with  one  person here.  Anyway, thanks for your kind comments on the sting (or rather, your nasty comments about the wasp), the swelling's gone down a lot and I can use the finger now. It's still a little painful to bend and quite sore around the area, but it's much better. Nice to know that if I get stung by a wasp I've got people who will swear bloody murder on it, even if it did die.  Question of the day: if you didn't know, how old would you think I am? I'm interested in this, mostly because I'm  that  vain but still, opinion is sharply divided (Scott, I know that's in a song you sung, don't do it, ye fool). Laura says that she quite often forgets I'm younger than her, Nikki doesn't ever really have an opinion on it, cause her feelings on my age change constantly, and most people I meet tend to think I'm in the sixth form. Only once or twice have people asked me how Uni's going.  Physics exam was OK, but in true me-style I'm going to say nothing more on it.  Marital status: Single and not bad enough to stop being so.  Quote of the day: "In a sweet little village, remote and obscure, A beautiful maiden resided. As to whether or not her intentions were pure, Opinion was sharply divided."
