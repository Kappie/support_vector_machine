I mean, yeah, I am doing the whole higher education beyond high school thing, but I am starting to see the  actual support  going on all around about that.  People I haven't seen in a  long time  have been asking how school was going for me.  I mean there are some folks that I haven't seen in   Years  , but they know what a native is doing.  I guess word gets around no matter what.  Also, I see that people are unique, but similar too.  Yeah, there are folks  laid back and helpful , but they also get  stressed  from time to time.  The release sometimes comes in a not so agreeable way, but is still a release.  I'm just trying to say they get  heated and moody  at times too.  This, I totally understand, but for them it's so out of character, they really feel bad about it.  They may regret getting aggressive and saying things totally unexpected, but I know already not to take it personal.  I try to express that to others around that are confused to the whole thing.  This part of the post just comes from recent events that reappeared lately.  Nothing really special, but still mentionable.  As for work though... I have to say the majority of it is still the same.  A lot of the old faces there, but also some new ones coming in.  They actually work out too.  The only lagging spots we have are from  previous hirees of last year .  I mean, it's soooooo bad some of these folks.  This one guy is like a  hypochondriac  when it comes to actually having to work.  He's managed to burn his hand so bad he wanted light duty for 2 weeks.  I mean,  this guy requested that ?  But, too bad for him, he was on a  10 day suspension  for something else, and wasted an excuse.  It's pretty strange though, but when he comes back to work, there are  no apparent scars  at all?  This one gul, she's so weird in her own way.  Her thing is to spark a heated argument, or maybe even try to strike out so she won't have to work.  That's so dumb, and dare I say,  Childish ?  Another guy wants to be a know it all and super sawyer, but actually is more of a threat through his lack of physical training and actual lack of knowledge.  These people are actual liabilities to us, but when we mention it, or even complain about them, we're looked at as the bad guys?  Oh wells, that's the way the ball bounces, so I just try to keep an eye on them so as to not get hurt on their account.  So, where to go now?  Oh, I just bought the first season of  Kids In The Hall  on dvd, along w/,  Tupac - Resurrection  too.  Then, I tried out Xzibit's crew's dvd,  Strong Arm Steady .  Most folks don't even know about the Kids In The Hall though, so when I bought it, the lady ringing me up was actually surprised.  That first season is from 89-90.  I was a young buck back then, but still remember who they were.  Went in the studio the other day and dropped half a verse along w/ tray.  It was for the  Rez Hogs  coming from the Yakama Rez.  The beat the rez hogs did was pretty good.  Trav actuall dropped 2 half verses so, it seems long enough for one full verse.  Mine was pretty short, but hopefully still memorable.  Tuke ( the other part of  Tha Lost Tribe  ) was someone I planned on getting on there too, but it ended up being just tray and me who got down.  Tray said the stuff we did for them ( rez hogs ) we should have kept for something on their ( tha lost tribe's ) album, but that's alright, we'll still do what we do.  At least they're getting a quality contribution on our part.  At least I'd like to think that.  Oh wells, we'll see how things shape up when those Yakama's tell us the verdict.  They're (rez hogs) are supposed to come around here for  urlLink HoopFest  next weekend, but I'm most likely going to be working.  If I get a chance though, I want to work more on the whole rapping thing.  I'm not apart of either group, but am actually like a mediator for them, because that's how they actually hooked up, was through me.  It's cool though, that they are working together.  I like both groups, and know they'll be making noise down the road.
