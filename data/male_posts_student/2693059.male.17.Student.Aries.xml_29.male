He still managed to win 3 of the 1st round but by the 4th it was difficult for him to throw punches. I knew there was no way Williams could beat him even though he has over 30 pounds of muscle on Tyson. If Tyson didn't tear his ligament Williams would have been knocked out in the 2nd round. I just hope Tyson can heal up. Now i feel like playing some Mike Tyson punchout for nintendo. Freedom Fighters is continuing to get funner and Manhunt is continuing to piss me off so if ne1 was to trade me a game for Manhunt tell me.  Im tired of people telling me they wanna see that weak ass catwoman movie too.  That shit is going to get the worst reviews ever.  People expect it to be like spiderman and daredevil and all that shit and follow the comic but noooo...  They completely remade costume,  that is the ugliest costume ive ever seen.  What the hell were they thinking.  She looks like a biker chick or somethin.  That costume in no way resembles a cat except for the mask.  Why didn't they just use the costume from Batman Forever or one like it.  They also changed the whole story, that should be illegal.  They basically took the name and idea of a woman who has Catlike attributes and fights crime and made it into shit.   Im not going to see the movie for the simple fact that the costume is retarded.  Also the funniest movie ever is Anchorman.  They should have done a better job advertising and it should have had a different name.  The good thing about that movie is that they don't show all their funny parts in the previews.  That movie is one of the funniest i have ever seen in my whole life.  The first 20 minutes of it i was regretting i bought the ticket for it.  But after the retarded jokes and dull parts the movie made a 360.  I believe this was done intentionally, but it could have backfired because i was about to leave the theater and get a refund.  You have togo see that movie over anything else.  Its better than everything in the theaters right now.  I wanna see that shit again.  Yup ima play some Live now.
