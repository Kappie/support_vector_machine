I got a 100% on my vital signs skills....the test consisted of Blood Pressure, Pulse Obliteration point, radial pulse, brachial pulse, temperature, and respiration rate....I know you might be sitting here reading this like "big effing deal"....well it is....we used one of those old fashioned mercury standing sphignomanometers (blood pressure thingy for the layman) and we were judged for our "technique" and these skill tests are usually graded very harshly....so I'm proud of myself....  In other news I have seriously considered chalking up the semester and restarting next year as a four year Freshman....I would be taking basically the same classes and whether I could really do it was never an issue....it was just a matter of having the right mind frame....and right now I STILL have too many loose ends at home to tie up....I'm on the road to full recovery of self....I'm just not all the way there yet  I had a really nice convo with a lady from Clark Atlanta University last night....our convo began with me having to defend my alma mater (Dear old  urlLink Morehouse  for the unintiated....how did you get here???...LOL)....and I realized that, while Morehouse may look like a really good place to those who only read "mainstream" press and the propaganda they send out, Morehouse has some serious PR problems brewing....the gays, malcontents whose parents force them to go there, and general arrogant jackoffs that comprise a large amount (although NOT the majority) of the student population are making Morehouse a hard pill to swallow for many of those in contact with them daily....now I will never be ashamed nor apologize for being a Morehouse Man....I was well prepared for life in general, as well as grad work, by Morehouse.....it is an excellent school and my experience there was unforgettable....but the big wigs need to work on improving the PR for my generation.....  Speaking of the AUC....congrats to the following....Spence, JT, Neil, Van, Dawud, Smitty, Jared (Squire), Randall, young Kathy, Rebecah, Bridgit, Deah (you shoulda told me!!....I woulda been there for you!), Tiffany, and the Kappa dudes (not gonna blow ya'll up yet...I'll wait till the proper time)....my neophyte Greek friends....remember your roots....and remember how you got to the point you are now.....I'm proud of all of you!  One last note....as is the early morning custom I was watching a Different World and an episode I had completely forgotten about came on.....it featured Tisha Campbell and Whoopi Goldberg....Whoopi was a dynamic speech teacher who helped Tisha (who I keep wanting to call Gina....that is typecasting folks!!!) to get the courage to tell everyone she had HIV/AIDS.....A Different World was really highly slept on....a truly great show...ahead of it's time!  Holla later....e-mail me at Killacal13@aol.com or on the instant messenger (I'm ALWAYS at least online....you might get an away message but those are the breaks eh?)
