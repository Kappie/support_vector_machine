KCeasy rules it is by far the best giFT front end. Think of it like its its just like KazaaLite (no adds or spyware) but it suports more networks. It works with OpenFT, Gnutella, and FastTrack (Kazaa) So get it from  urlLink there site .  A freind is taking me skiing in about 30mins (9 o'clock) so ill check back in latter eh? Ok.  - Jeff
