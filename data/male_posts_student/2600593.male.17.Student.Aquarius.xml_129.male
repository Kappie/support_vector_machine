      I went and saw Spider-man 2 last night, and I have to say that it was a very very good movie. It was really well done, and I would go see it again. I went to the new theater in Spartanburg, SC called "Spartan 16" which is the same one in which I saw "The Day after Tomorrow". If you were worried about spending your money to see this movie, then don't it was well worth it for me.
