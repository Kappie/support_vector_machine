The other night, at around 10.30, I was on PC, talking to a few people, listening to some music (I think it was Outlandish I was listening to). But yeh, I heard a noise, like a beating, and the lgiht coming my way from the lgihts began to sort of flicker.  I looked up, and there was a MASSIVE moth there - it had come in through the open window, attracted by the light.  I thought SHIT! Its some sort of mutant extra large moth! I went and got some tissue, ready to grab it and flush it down the toilet! However, when I returned to my room - the moth was nowhere to be found.I looked everywhere, but nothing. I presumed it had gone out of the window by itself.  The next night, at around 9.45pm, again I was on my pc chatting to a few people about some stuff - and I looked up, and it was back! The moth was staring down on me from the ceiling!  I ran and got some tissue, and tried reaching for it, made a jump for it, and YES, I'd got it! It still had life in it, I could feel it trying to escape my grip, I took a closer look, and it shot out and started flying around the room again.  It had rested on my wall this time, I wasted no time, I grabbed it! This time, it was mine! I quickly ran to the bathroom and flushed it down!  Tibsy 1 Moth 0  I'd just like to add I don't usually kill innocent insects, its just that moths ae so annoying and they can eat your clothes you know.   I used to have a Tarantula - sorta proving I'm not into killing insects and spiders. (Yes folks, a Spider is NOT an insect)  I'll blog again tomorrow - laters.
