So I stumble out to the bathroom where I do the usual processes to remove said lump of phlegm, and when I spat it out, it was black!  Black, I tell ya!  Then, while I was in the shower about an hour or so ago, blood started pouring out of my nose, and I had to cough up another wonderful black gob... tasty  The obvious reason for all of this is that I must have had a blood nose in my sleep or something, which all clotted at the back of my throat, as I sleep on my back - my nose started 'bleeding' in the shower because the steam loosened up the dried blood in there..  Just felt like sharing this all with yas =P  Now why the  fuck  won't Grand Theft Auto 3 either save my game properly or load my saved games without crashing?  See the previous post for my thoughts on this issue =D
