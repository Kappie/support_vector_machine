In January, Gibson will launch its next generation digital guitar with onboard microprocessor, this is the first of its kind, and sends sound through an Ethernet cable as opposed to a mono 1/4".   The unit ($3000) will make it possible to isolate the sounds of each string and send them to different channels for mixing, why this is useful is obvious, but why this will make producer's jobs' even more tedious is also. But as with any new digital device, the question remains, can it play breakout?
