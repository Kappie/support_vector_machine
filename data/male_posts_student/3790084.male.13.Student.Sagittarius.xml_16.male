Yesterday the Channel 8 was screening the "purple vine romance" starred Ruby lin and the korean hottest block Han Jae Suk. I love it. This is a story about promise being made bye two childhood friends... and the story goes on  how Han Jae Suk finds back and keep his promise...This is basically a story about love and friendship..
