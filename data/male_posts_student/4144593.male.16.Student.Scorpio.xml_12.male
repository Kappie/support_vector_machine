Friday morning ..... i just love Fridays ... it symbolises tt the long hard week is soon to be over .... with the added advantage of being able to wake up late.  Spent the morning shopping with mom for groceries. Went to NTUC fairprice n she brought the neccesities for the next week. I had to carry so many bags of stuff until i sian. Then return home turned on my computer found tt i had nothing to do. So bored until i tried sleeping n i just could not sleep.,slept too much already. Check my wallet found tt it was empty n so i went to ATM. fourth time this week liao, already took out $130 so far this week n then i still hav to see movie with ashley tmr.OMG i going broke, my weekly pocket money iz only $50 i spent $130 liao how am i going to survive the month.   Went to bus stop, again exact same thing happened as yesterday. The bus had to run away the moment i ran to the bus stop. Again i did not chase the bus cuz i planned to be late anyway. So i waited for the next bus to arrive. Went i boarded the bus, i heard some1 called out my name. So i looked around n saw kelvin(from my class not K.L or K.G). I went n sat next to him, apparently he was trying to be late too. For two consequtive dayz, i wanted to be late, missed a bus, boarded the next bus n some1 from my class is on it. Maybe it a divine sign telling mi i should be late more. We chatted on the bus n then he came to the topic i feared. BOWLING SCORE FROM YESTERDAY.  Reached sch, found out tt every1 all did not went for MR SOH's e-learning. Had another session of crapping e-learning for com n it. Then we has lunch at south canteen, saw ya-ling and the gals. They were buying bubble tea, then i was joking bout wee kiat to Hui-ni. Anyway for the ppl who dunno, wee kiat iz the Ex of hui-ni n i just happens to noe him n we hav the same name. Then went to have lunch, n guess who i saw, Wee kiat n he was lining up at the same bubble tea shop. Went up to him n chatted for a while. Asked if he saw hui-ni, he said no. Well i guessed as much cuz he was flirting with a pretty gal next to him (as usual). Ate lunch n went to Com n it leture. Sean n siyan slept while wee leong weian n i chatted bout anything n everything. Time flew so fast n be4 we knew it , i was Mr Soh leture.For once I understood everything he said(well now i believe in miracles) . But tt stupid fadhil had to spolt things the very first time i really understood mr soh. Fadhil started reminding every1 i was suppose to strip today cuz of the stupid bet we made yesterday. He was irritating mi until i did not catch anything from mr soh. Anyway for any CEP students who are reading this, a good advice for u. If u dun understan wat mr soh teaching nvm just go read the yellow bible (u noe the book u brought) . Helps a lot.  CEP lesson ended n it time 4 hell. The guyz wanna strip mi in the leture room. Luckly most ppl left liao except our class ppl n mr soh only. I had no choice, i was the one who agreed. Well i hid behind a pillar n ...................................................................... Luckly the gals who saw were angela n carol from b2 . Otherwise i dunno how to face the world.   End of sch n we went to play table tennis n badminton. Badminton fully booked so we played table tennis. Played for a while saw a court in badminton was empty n we ran to it. Played for a while then the advanture club ppl needed to use the space for something so we returned to playing table tennis. Sean left for swimming, siyan left for kendo. Only left the three extra talkative 1's. Then a gal asked if she can join us. Being gentlemen(at least i was, dunno bout the other 2), we of course agreed. The two of them took turns to play with the gal. Could see tt they were hesitating to smack cuz afterall we r playin against a gal. Played until 8 pm then we went to shower. Showering after exercise feels so great. But once again the blur side of mi have to resurface. I only remember tt i did not bring a towel after i finished showering. Had to use tissue paper instead. Weian was even more funny, i nv seen a person who can shower without getting his hair wet except him. His reason.... he did not want to mess up his hairstyle. Left sch at 8.30, must have been the latest i ever had. Then had to walk the underground(sort of) passage way which links the sch to the mrt station. It was so bloody dark ..... so scary.... u could not see wat in front of u. Weeleong was complainin bout the sch being cheapskate. Left sch went to terminal n took a bus home. Well i guess tt a nice end to my hectic 5 days. Hope the weekend is much better although i noe sunday gonna be a real hell of a day for mi. Cuz i noe some1 gonna get hurt cuz of mi. Anyway i just wanna hav as much fun tmr with ashley, edmund , doreamon n kelvin low as possible. Cya guyz tmr .......   Doreamon aka lulu - ur blog sux lor mine iz a lot better.... how dare u say mine sux ..... go bang the wall lar
