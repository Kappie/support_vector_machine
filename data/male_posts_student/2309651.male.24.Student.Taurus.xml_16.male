His campaign staff is stacked with ex-Kennedy employees.  His voting record in the Senate is the pits.  The worst part is any attempt for him to move to the center (which he should have done by now) has been met with some sort of soundbyte from the past or vote that he cast that contradicts him.  Kerry needs to find a message and find it soon.  Perhaps he should not be waiting so long to pick a VP.  The way things are going for Bush these days, Kerry should be up by about 15 points.  But it is still close.  He needs to start listening to moderate Democrats.  Listen to the Breauxs, the Libermans, the Bayhs.  For God sakes, stop listening to Kennedy and stop taking him around the country showboating him.  Kennedy does not represent the American that most Americans want!
