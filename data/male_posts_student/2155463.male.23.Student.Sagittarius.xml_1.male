I swear, if we would have had one of these when I lived at home we could have precluded so many fights...:-P  Oh yeah...went with Mortar Board to King Kennedy last night to help with the library project.  We kinda underestimated the scope of the project (we were going to try to organize all the books), so I think we only got about 2/5 done, but it was fun.  Of course, everyone there probably thinks that I'm just some big mute since I didn't talk much, but that's pretty much my pattern in groups I'm not used to.  In fact, I was thinking about it today...I think that my level of timidity/boisterousness is directly related to what I perceive my role and status in a group to be and how comfortable I am in it.  Case in point:  I'm not real used to hanging out with the Mortar Board or Tau Sigma folks, so I doubt that I've said more then 10 words in any of our meetings or activities.  Volleyball with the Robinson gang during the summers, on the other hand, I seriously can't shut up (as much as I might wish I would, sometimes :-P).  So anyway...I'm working on WPNI stuff tonight.  I think I have my resume done, but I need to really start getting serious about looking for internships; time is passing way too fast.  I got an e-mail from someone from Senator DeWine's office asking me about funding information, but I'm holding off on getting back to him until I have my financial aid info back from Kent.    Of course, on the other hand I need MORE time to work on Lianda stuff...it looks like our surveillance audit is going to be sometime in early-January, so that would mean we would have our internal audit sometime in later-November or early-December.  I need to do a LOT of work before we're ready, but I just don't see it happening right now because of all the schoolwork I need to do.  Oh, and speaking of doing schoolwork, I don't know what it is but it seems like I'm reading at about 1/3 of the pace that I used to.  As I was joking with someone the other day, I think it's because I'm actually trying to understand what I'm reading :-P  But this is seriously something that I'm going to need to fix before I start law school...I think I might take a speed-reading course during next summer.  Speaking of law school...I finally got out my letter of recommendation requests to my two profs! :)  Now I just need to get the other one to Shawn (my boss), but he leaves for China early next week...better get my butt in gear.  Oh, and I got an invitation to apply to Case Law School the other day (and a waiver of the application fee), so my dad will be glad to hear about that (he seems to like Case).  Aside from that...I don't know what it is about California law schools, but I seem to get something from one of them about every other day.  Sometimes they sure look tempting, though...sunny days, warm temperatures, beautiful beaches, the ocean, hot girls (oh, wait, did I say that?!)...that would be awesome (if I could put up with the snakes, scorpions, pollution, and Californians...on second thought, I'll stay in Ohio...we have enough hot girls, and they're NICE :-P).  Now where's that brochure from the school in Florida?...
