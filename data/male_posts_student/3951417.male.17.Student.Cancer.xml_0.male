ANAK**$!!!!! tayo na nga lang magkakasama sa walang kwentang skul na to kala nyo kung sino kayo. yung mga iba naman namamansin sila at nakikipagkuwentuhan pero yung iba nakakaloko na. parang gusto ko silang hagisan ng mga silya. E=mc2.      Second. "...: gaya gaya naman talaga itong tag board na ito eh.. ive seen this site before... wala naman.. mr pocholo henson.. ive seen your site.. and it looks exactly like this... yeah.. only blue.. yeah" "plaigarism? holy crap... your blog looks like mine! only, it's blue!...that says a lot about you..."  GAGO. ooohhh.... my site has a tagboard... cool... has a graphic of the week too... awesome dude... give me a freaking break. what's next, "cadaver of the week?" DumbASS.
