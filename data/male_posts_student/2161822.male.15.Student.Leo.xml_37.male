In that time I will be sitting around watching TV or outside enjoying the snow that we don't really have. I mean we have snow, but not snow snow. I was going to go sledding with a certain Neil Ciotola, but we realized that there was no snow on the road. Plus there's an intersection at the bottom of the hill, so probably one of us would get hit by a car. But then again the sled would be handy if that would occur since we can put the injured body on the sled and simply push them to their house. Oh, but then again theres no snow on the ground so that might not work. Plus the one pushing will probably think its funny and tip the sled over. So scratch that idea. Plus I spelled Ciotola right. I should get a prize. So basically my plans boil down to me and once again a certain Neil Ciotola freezing the basketball court by my house. That would be interesting though. Basketball on ice. Beside falling down everytime and hurting yourself badly I'm sure it's a promising idea. Hey can it get any worse than some of our other ideas. It couldn't go worse than when I tried to dunk on a pogo stick. Or running up an ice covered slide and falling on my face. Or.... and the list goes on. I love that court. It was basically where I spent all of my summer. Playing basketball at that beautiful court. Well, if you can look past all the cracks in the court, the grass growing near the foul line, the excessive amount of trash laying around, and the netless playground hoops, then it's just like an NBA court. And the playground by it is even better. With the swings that sound like they will break everytime you get on them. Or the sandbox that lacks sand and instead is filled with, well, I don't know what it is. Or the picnic tables and benches tied down to trees. Ah the beauty of Hazleton. Brings me to tears sometimes. Or maybe that's all the pollution in the air irritating my eyes. Either way, who can't love this town. Rhetorical sarcastic question. NEÖTÆRIK's show will be scheduled for JANUARY 3RD. You guys better be there. It's gonna be awesome, and if you guys want something to do instead of sitting here, show up at Funnybones. I guarentee you'll be impressed.  Listen to H.I.M.
