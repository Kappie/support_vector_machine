It was great, until i tried to get my brother outa bed to go tubbing with chris and his cousin.  Finally i got him out and then he decided to make a call to try to get more people to go, which was dan.  After about an hour or less of talking to dan on and off the phone he finally could come over.  During that time me and my bro filled up the intertube and then he left to pick up dan.  Now if you don't know my brother you would think that it would take about 10 minutes to drive into town and then back here, but no, my brother drives like an old granny on weed.  He will take forever to get to someplace when you are not with him but then when u are with him he will go around sharp turns goin 60.  So while i was waiting for him to get back chris and his cousin, ashley, came over.  So i just took them down to the dock with the intertube and was going back to the house to call dan's house to see were they were, they were inside changing.  So finaly we went tubbing, now what i mean by we went tubbing is they went tubbing and i watched because i aint gunna go tubbing for a while.  After chris and ashley went home me, my bro, and dan watched the simpsons and then chris called and we started talkin about going to see a movie.  we decided to see Hellboy.  all in all it was a good movie, i advise you to see it if u havent.  now i am to here, the lyrics i am posting is a song about masterbation that chris let us hear on the way to the movie, so here it is have fun with it   I sit around and watch the tube but nothing's on I change the channels for an hour or two Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit I'm sick of all the same old shit In a house with unlocked doors And I'm fucking lazy  Bite my lip and close my eyes Take me away to paradise I'm so damn bored I'm going blind And I smell like shit  Peel me off this velcro seat and get me moving I sure as hell can't do it by myself I'm feeling like a dog in heat Barred indoors from the summer street I locked the door to my own cell And I lost the key  Bite my lip and close my eyes Take me away to paradise I'm so damn bored I'm going blind And I smell like shit  I got no motivation Where is my motivation No time for the motivation Smoking my inspiration  I sit around and watch the phone but no one's calling Call me pathetic call me what you will (screw ya) My mother says to get a job But she don't like the one she's got When masturbation's lost it's fun You're fucking breaking  Bite my lip and close my eyes Take me away to paradise I'm so damn bored I'm going blind And loneliness has to suffice Bite my lip and close my eyes I'm slipping away to paradise Some say "Quit or I'll go blind" But it's just a myth  Longview-Greenday
