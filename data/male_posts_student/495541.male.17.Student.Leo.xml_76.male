I forget the details but who cares anyways?  Let me continue.    Throughout the tests, I had to stop for a few moments and just clear my head.  So much is going on in my life right now, sometimes I feel like I’m going to explode.  There’s so much I could say really, but I express this depression in a somewhat unconcerned look.  I kind of consciously day-dreamt through it.  To get back on track here, I kept thinking through the tests what kind of effect this actual test is going to have on my life if I were to do badly.  I thought, this would go on my permante record.  If I did extremely badly in a particular part of the test, would I fall behind in society and get a lower paying job and end up in a crummy one room apartment almost to the point of being on welfare?  I surely couldn’t tell you at the moment, but that’s what I was wondering only several questions into each test.  Whenever I got stuck I’d go back into that loop of though and be distraught by my possible future.  In total, I didn’t answer 19 questions because of time limits.  I couldn’t help but wonder if they actually gave enough time or if I was just not intelligent enough to finish it in time.  I will never know.  I need sleep.  Don’t we all?  Question of the moment: Why do glass light bulbs screw in place?
