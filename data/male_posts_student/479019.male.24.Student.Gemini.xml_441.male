We had dinner, a couple of beers, and talked about the lack off fine women here in Binghamton. I think that's a problem for me and lets me dwell on girls back in California that I can't have or I might not be interested in if I wasn't here. It's hard because I'm picky enough as it is. That's not to say I haven't met some interesting and decent looking women here, but no one has really caught my attention.  For example there's this cute girl that works in the reserve room, but after overhearing her talking to someone else working there (as I did some stapling)... she seemed so uninteresting. Few girls in the history of my life have been really interesting to me. I think if I were to get involved with some of my options here... it'd be like it was with Trang... content, but not necessarily happy. Then again being content might be nice.  Time to get some reading done.  **
