Lately I have been accused of being rather geeky. So I happen to enjoy some anime! I like Star Wars but who doesn’t? (Star Trek is pure crap! The whole basis is that they are lost and can’t find there way home. Yet they have all the technology to do all these bizarre things and they can’t even find a freaking map! So I’m being simplistic but my point is that its BAD!) I like video games, but so do most teenagers. So what I like to read? There’s a reason so many books are made every year in the world: people like to read! I like to write.  Lots of people write otherwise there would be no books. Last but not least, the web comics. Yes I like to read some web comics.  I am the same as the people who read comics in the newspaper, mine are just on the Internet! So :P! Thank you for your time.  - Dark Lily  0>--}----
