If you don't know what goatse.cx is, DO NOT GO THERE IT IS HORRIFYINGLY DISTURBING.  If you've been there before and you know what it is, I am sorry.  Here is what the main page says now:  ALERT  The CX Registry has shut off the goatse.cx domain suddenly and without warning. They have cowardly cited a section of their AUP with allows them to remove sites at their discretion. Please e-mail info@nic.cx with your opinion of this matter.  I just thought this was very important.  hahaha. no i didn't. AND SERIOUSLY, AS A DISCLAIMER, I CANNOT NOT BE BLAMED FOR ANYONE'S ACTIONS SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO GO TO THIS OBSCENELY HORRENDOUS WEBSITE. BY VISITNG THAT SITE, YOU WILL CORRUPT YOUR MIND FOREVER.  If you want to go to a cool site that I promise is not obscene in any way, go to www.omgwtf.com. It is pretty cool.
