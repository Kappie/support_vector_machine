FUN GAME. i was playing with the suns and i lost twice in a row to the spurs by like 2 points, GRRR...i won the third game which made me happy. penny owned every game...one game he had, 13 points, a block and 3 steals. the only thing that really bites about the game (as alex knows) is that gilbert arenas, along with the warriors in general, is utter trash. cruel world...
