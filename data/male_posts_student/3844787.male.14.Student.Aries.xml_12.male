But i'll tell you what i've actually done.  On Monday night, I stayed at Simon's house, and we just pissed about in his outhouse where we slept, and watched peter kay, and played on the ps2 and xbox. After this we had a load of fun with a board marker, drawing eyes and stuff around my nipples, I know it sounds wierd, but I had a face on my chest, so I was happy! Just joking, I was annoyed that I forgot about it and when into their houes topless, the Mum was in hysterics, so I went into the dvd cupboard, and got cd's, which doesn't make sence, but these cd's were all sixties cd's!!  After this, we went back to the outhouse (with drinks and food) and turned on the rotating discoball that hangs from the ceiling, this was quite fun! During this we rang a load of people and I put on a voice and told them I loved them and stuff, it was one of those weird things that happens,  PRANK CALLS!   One main thing that we did that night was drink 22 cans of coke and stack them on top of each other so they went all the way to the ceiling, it was cool!  The day after, Sam came back to my house, and we watched dvd's and played on the xbox, HOW INTERESTING! He stayed the night, and we went on his electric scooter and things which was pretty cool, as it goes around 25mph! It was interesting......  The next day, I slept at Sams house, and that brings us to here, after a night full of the pc, and no  MESSENGER PLUS FORUMS!!! IT WAS MURDER!!!
