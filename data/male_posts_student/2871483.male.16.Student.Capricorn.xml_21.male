I shouldn't complain, though, at least she said yes...sorta.        The Band headed up the 'Bay for a girls basketball game.  It was scary.  We were on these dilapidated bleechers, way up high, and across the gym from where the dance team was (again, dammit).  Very frightening.  We won, though, so it was turned out well, I guess.         All in all, the day wasn't really that bad, but I can't think of anything to do tonight.  Looks like it's back to the old TV for comfort!
