So the question is who will remember?  Hmmmm?  We will see! ODD NEWS! So me and Josh were talknâ€™ and he was blabbing on and on and I asked him if for once he had something important to say and well he started off by telling me this interesting fact:  a 14-year-old from north "grass" Manchester England has been ordered by a "grass" judge not to say the word "grass" until the year 2010. If he says "grass" the boy could face 5 years in "grass" custody. Well, there goes that part time lawn mowing job. I wonder who will wish me a happy half-birthday
