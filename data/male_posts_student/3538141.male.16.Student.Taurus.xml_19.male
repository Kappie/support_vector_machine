As soon as I walk into the dark, cluttered study, with about 3 phones ringing at once, I feel stressed. It can't be good for me, I'm getting through a disproportionate amount of muffins. This is not good as my Kung Fu grading is on Sunday. It's the last one before the black belt, and my god is it going to be hard. Ideally, I would have had a little longer to learn my form, but with holidays coming up, and then back to school to do 5 A-levels in September, my fitness wouldn't be up to it. So I'm throwing myself in at the deep end. With muffins in me. In other news, I really really really want one of those Ferrari laptops. They look like Ferraris, go like Ferraris and are actually better value for money than the equivalent Sony, Dell or Toshiba. We'll see how much money I have at the end of the holidays...
