Just take your red, black, and blue for granted. Hold your goddamn head high, and fear everything the media and god tells you.  Why not trust your politicians, fellow activist's, and righteous religious revolutionaries.  When it comes to believing they must know a thing or two.  When after all, isn't your life, other peoples lives, and death, a game.  Why not just trust, that in the end, there's only pain...
