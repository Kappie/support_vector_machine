    
       so close.  you are so close.  i look to you and i can almost see your beautiful eyes staring back at me.  i just want to reach out and take you in my arms.  but though you are so close... you are still so far.  within grasp and yet out of my reach.  and this is the requiem of a longing heart.  a lonely heart.  goodnight kids.
