The teacher gave me a 3 hour dosage of it, making me all down and out with no energy to practically do anything.  Slacked around for a while when KL called me. Met him at Atrium, although didnt play any ID today. Took the train where he alighted off Yio Chu Kang and me, Sembawang. Headed to Sun Plaza to play some cheap Wangan (same price as CS) and when I was at my last round, Shiro came running to the cabinet and shocked me ! Along with Melissa who went to my ear and shouted she wanna challenge the Evo VIII guy sitting next to me.  So they started, and wow, she slapped on the start and dragged him by around.. say.. 700 metres ? Poor guy. Lol. Left at 7.30pm, met my dad to go the funeral of my godfather at his block's pavilion.  Saw my godfather in the coffin, he didnt look like he was... uh.. RIP ? But somewhat its kind of sad to see him go... he treated me kinda well and all... and now hes gone, just like that. Sigh..  Stayed till 9.45 pm when my mum egged us to go home, wonder whats the hurry but oh well... headed for home lor. So I'm awake till now, surviving the fatigue in my eyes to type out this entry. *glad*  Oh did I mention I woke up with a bad sinus in my nose ? Sneezing and whoozing the whole day until late afternoon when it got enough and stopped the manifestation of mucus. And my eyes, somewhat listless, couldnt get me to open it for long, had to close once in a while... the eyelids felt especially heavy today.. Ahh... I need to sleep in !!!! ~.~"  Ok.. so heres the last post before our nation's 39th birthday... Happy birthday Singapore !! *Woooo* Cheers ! May the upcoming year be smooth and steady ! *lol*  Good night everyone ! =)
