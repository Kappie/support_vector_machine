Hence, in the building I’m staying in, the third floor is student rooms, the second is the Linguistics department, and the ground floor is English.  Graduations, which were happening yesterday, continue today. Fuckheads. The question for me is, who the fuck are these people? I had never heard of Lancaster University or of anyone going there until this year.The weirdness of this place has shifted from the weirdness of being in England, which is still there, to a dislocation around the continuities between this place and Sydney. Being in an institutional environment makes it much the same – wandering around lost yesterday afternoon, I could almost have been wandering around UNSW lost. Moreover, the weather here, the weather of a typical British Summer, is continuous with the Sydney Winter weather I left behind.
