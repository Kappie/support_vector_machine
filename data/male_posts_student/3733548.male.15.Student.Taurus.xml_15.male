I got covered in shaving cream, popcorn and corn chips placed on me, and then I couldn't see, but Mandy, whom I met tonight gave me the gift of sight by wiping off one side of my "goggles" thus I was able to see. we sang then and, and heard Adam speak, which was another highlight, and then Marlon took me home. We will sit upon getting gason the way home for a moment. We were at the "PIX" Gas Station. there is a girl there that I met when we were having the "Scavenger Hunt" one Wed. night and I met her with Jonathan. Jon knew her, and we needed an Attendant to wipe our windshield for one of the "hits" that we had to film, she was that attendant. but It was funny tonight being that she obviously didnt remember who I was, but knew that I looked familiar and I was watching her try to figure out where she had seen me before. It was actually quite intriguing. but again, i must say, before i go to bed. Marlon Wareley is my FAVORITE South African.
