Though one wished to dispute with him,  he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.   His wisdom is profound, his power is vast.  Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?   He moves mountains without their knowing it  and overturns them in his anger.   He shakes the earth from its place  and makes its pillars tremble.   He speaks to the sun and it does not shine;  he seals off the light of the stars.   He alone stretches out the heavens  and treads on the waves of the sea.   He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion,  the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.   He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed,  miracles that cannot be counted. "  Job 9:1-10
