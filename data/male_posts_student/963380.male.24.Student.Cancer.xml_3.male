I think these programs are similar on more than one level.  I spent the better part of this evening trying to track down what appears to be a virus or worm on my machine. It kept saying that I had the Nimda virus - which I ran the removal tool for, no such thing. Emails of around 10 megs in size kept popping up in various folders from my dad's old computer. weird shit.Got rid of it though.  I think I'm going to get a bit before I sleep, hopefully it'll help this heartburn.  I'm dying - one day at a time, just like everybody else :)
