I think they should just stay there and stuff but oh well.     I am going to cali for my big bros graduation, then to see my uncle Matt. I have never seen matt that i can remeber. so that will be kinda cool then when we get back ill get my Laptop fixed (I WAS RIGHT THE HOLE TIME! ALL IT NEEDED WAS A NEW OS!!!) but i am gonna have fun. well thats it... untill next time. bye
