Young jazz men with a new sense are gathering. At last they created a new genre itself. They are sick and tired of the conventional fixed style jazz. They're eager to play jazz more freely as they wish then... in 2071 in the universe... The bounty hunters, who are gathering in the spaceship "BEBOP", will play freely without fear of risky things. they must create new dreams and films by breaking traditional styles. The The work, which becomes a new genre itself, will be called... "COWBOY BEBOP" 3..2..1... LET'S JAM!  The English may be a bit jumbled, but the message in the Cowboy Bebop promos effectively captures the essence of the series. Cowboy Bebop is the tale of a futuristic maverick, Spike Spiegel, a space cowboy and his band of partners (Jet Black, Faye Valentine, Edward, and lets not forget Ein the dog), as they race across the galaxy on daring adventures. They are Bounty Hunters struggling to survive in a world that is a strange combination of past, present, and future. There are fantastic space crafts and interstellar casinos side by side with droopy sombreros and slow traffic lights. With each new bounty that they go after, new characters are introduced, and new cosmic landscapes are explored. The series is episodic, as Spike Spiegel heads off on a new quest each week to secure a new prize. There is action galore, moments of dry humor, and an incredible blend of computer and traditional animation. Spike's adventures are set to the very music that the series attempts to capture the spirit of- fabulous BEBOP. The music is such an important part of the series that it just wouldn't be the same without it. All in all, Cowboy Bebop offers a spectacular blend of adventure, humor, music, and drama!
