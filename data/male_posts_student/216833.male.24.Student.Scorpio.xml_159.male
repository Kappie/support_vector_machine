The rooms are a little smaller, but I think I will have a better peace of mind for sure. What else: Tomorrow is my second interview with Legacy Marketing Group. Wish me luck on all that. I am going to Lodi later that afternoon. Stopping at Ikea for a computer desk, or at least to look at them. They have alot of rad furniture for cheap. Since I sold everything I owned before moving out here, I have to gather a few things. They canned two guys at work this week. They two guys that have been there the longest and the two guys I get along with most. Brenden and Steve got the ax becuase they had to cut hours. I've had to work with Matt a few nights this week. They day always starts out okay and by the end, I've heard his mouth run for hours that I just want to get out! Death may it be, anything to save me! I try to sit and read but I get interupted. I try to show as little interest as possible. I believe that it's just to hear his voice. Ugh. Friday night, I'm going to see Horror City Superstition. Jeremy, mimi's brother, plays guitar and I think they are very rad. Download their new song. Anyways, I need to clean up a bit. I need to start packing but that is never any fun. I'm halfway packed becuase I havn't unpacked alot of stuff.   current mood:  indifferent current music: nick cave and the bad seeds - o'malley's bar
