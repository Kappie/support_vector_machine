Three and a half hours--how is this possible?  I am perfectly ok with Spanish, fairly confident about Psychology, so what is it that I am dreading?  Pre-calculas.  I bet you don't know what else I am tired of.  Well, I'll tell you because this is my place to bitch and complain.  I am tired of people being in a such a fucking good mood.  Yes, that's right, it came straight from my fingers and I don't even care.  I am such a rebel.  Anyway, be in crappy mood once in a while.  Don't be negative all of the time because we all know that it gets old, fast.  All I ask of you is to not be so cheery all of the time, day in and day out, hour after hour after hour.  Be pissed at someone,call a certain librarian not so nice names, make a grown woman cry because she is such an awful spanish teacher, I don't care what you people do just be mean and nasty.  I really get sick of all of the positiveness of the holiday season.  You people have no reason to be happy, yes I know, Jesus-our lord and saviour who died for our sins and the world and human kind was born but, well, I don't know.  You are spending money, hard-earned money, on stuff for people who you don't want to get stuff for and who don't really want your crap.  If you have a good friend or a family member who has been especially nice this year then yes, get them something and show your appreciation but don't if they haven't.  Besides, I read that Jesus' real birthday was in the spring but the Catholic Church was trying to convert pagans to christianity and the end of December just happens to fall on the Winter Solcist, an ancient pagan holiday.  It was supposed to make the transition easier for the pagans.  I apologize because I am not in a very good mood right now but after the stupid semesters I will again blog and hopefully my authoring will be a little more positive.
