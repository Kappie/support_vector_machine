Compaq, owned by Hewlett-Packard, from room J32 Saybrook College I stab at thee!  So where was I before I was so rudely interrupted. Things are going well enough here - class is picking up the pace, but I think I'm actually getting it now. We're actually having fun in class, which is cool. Morning classes have really made me appreciate how delicious responsibility free weekends are. All this time to laze around, hang out, read, and break into parts of Yale. Pretty fucking sweet. Despite all that free time, I still haven't unpacked, although I did go to the "Family Dollar" to get some coat hangers and bounce. I'll get aroud to it by week eight. Then I'll finally wash my clothes.  Sooo much Pocky.  Other than that, not much has been going on. Other than one massive in the works plan whose very legality forces me to remain mum if it actually goes through. Which it won't, knowing me. But I did finish  The Confusion  by Neal Stepheson, the second novel in the Baroque Cycle trilogy, which is in turn linked Stephenson's earlier tome  The Cryptonomicron . Fucking brilliant books, every one. These are without a doubt some of my, if not absolutely, my favorite novels. It's hard to explain, and you may need to read them - which can seem like quite an undertaking, as none of them clocks in under eight hundred pages. But I never read a book that long where I was sad that it ended. Just look at the review of Confusion by Entertainment Weekly (Whom I will suspend criticism of out of my love of Stephenson); " [T]he definitive historical-sci-fi-epic-pirate-comedy-punk-love story. No easy feat, that.  Damn fucking straight. I can barely wait the four months for the end of the series,  The System of the World  to come out.  Luckily I have much to read and much to do in the meantime. William Langewiesche's  The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime , a survey and analysis of the international shipping industry, international regulation, and the oceans and shipping (along with the rise in nautical based piracy and the possibility of terrorism) as a whole, is turning out pretty well. I've made it about halfway through and reasonably satisfied.   But before we go into the boring world that I am so fascinated by, allow me a brief interlude. Recently, I had the 'chance' to converse online with the littlest Gorton (ie; Mandy's rising Freshman sister) and I'm still dumbfounded. Middleschoolers are bizzare, maybe this one especially so. She imed me, and asked me such questions on how long Mandy has been staying up, why I asked her to prom (continually claiming I dodged the question), whether she was mentioned in Mandy's diary, and how big my rims were. For my part, I told her a clown killed my father and repeatedly called her an idiot. Between her insanity and my beratings, she eventually told me I was being too mean and I must have problem if I need to put down people. At which point I, stuck, apologized sincerlely and then proceeded to calmly explain to her why she will never grow up to be anything more than a housewife. She then told me I didn't even know here  "fav color"  and signed off. Its a pretty funny log if anyone wants it. I took it as nothing more than screwing with another member of the Gorton clan, and indirectly screwing with Mandy. But Sam's advice was to "tap that, dawg" and I can't ignore that. Even Mandy, despite repeated claims to the contraty and lengthy forbidding, seems to encourage me;  nonexpes: She may very well hate you. Though I interpreted her hatred as repressed attraction. SwongaDamnit: hot SwongaDamnit: she must be soo attracted to me then.  Sweet. I can fulfill all my dreams and be the next Shane Combest - keeping those senior/freshman relations alive and well. Hah, I'm such a tool.   Boring, yet important   Today, for obvious reasons, will be very Reagan heavy. The controversey surrounding his presidency merits some looking into, as many claim him to be messiah while others the anti-christ. But the effect he has held on the modern american presidency since his administration, especially in economic policies, cannot be denied. I am neither Reaganaut nor Reagan-hater, but everyone should look a little more deeply into the matter.  -The Economist's brief  urlLink analysis  of Reagan and his administration. Fairly praising, but still fairly unbiased. Definitely not sycophantish. Worth a read. "Reagan, who died on Saturday June 5th aged 93, turned out to be one of the two or three most effective presidents of the past half-century; some would say the best of them all. Now the intellectuals can start musing about the hidden strengths that overcame all those too-evident weaknesses."  - urlLink Reagan as a liberal . What? Another interesting look.   -For those with enough patience to wade through dry economic data,  urlLink this  is breakdown of the tax policies of Kennedy and Reagan, and the Laffer curve in general. Heres an example:"The basic idea behind the relationship between tax rates and tax revenues is that changes in tax rates have two effects on revenues: the arithmetic effect and the economic effect. The arithmetic effect is simply that if tax rates are lowered, tax revenues (per dollar of tax base) will be lowered by the amount of the decrease in the rate. The reverse is true for an increase in tax rates. The economic effect, however, recognizes the positive impact that lower tax rates have on work, output, and employment--and thereby the tax base--by providing incentives to increase these activities. Raising tax rates has the opposite economic effect by penalizing participation in the taxed activities. The arithmetic effect always works in the opposite direction from the economic effect. Therefore, when the economic and the arithmetic effects of tax-rate changes are combined, the consequences of the change in tax rates on total tax revenues are no longer quite so obvious."  -Onto non-reagan material.  urlLink Here  is a briefing on the Iraqi Sovreignty Transfer for any confused or just ignorant, done by another one of my favorite magizines, The Week,   -The US is repositioning some of its troops from Germany and South Korea as part of a globa shift to do away with needless Cold War costs and deployments and to create much more flexible force. But this may stretch the already tenuous alliances and relationships with both countries; Germany opposed the war in Iraq, and many South Koreans believe that the US is needlessly antagonizing North Korea. Others fear that North Korea may see the withdrawl as tacit acceptance of its nuclear policies - that the US is backing down. Read more  urlLink here .  -Not political, but interesting. A  urlLink survey  on the etymological roots of phrases like "bee's knees" and "dressed to the nines". A sort of analysis of language.    Emma's Good News Journal   - Apparently, some Germans think they've found  urlLink atlantis . Those wacky krauts.  -The green dream of using just the Sun, wind and water for energy may only be a generation away on a large Swedish island, which hopes to do without any fossil fuels by 2025.

More than 50,000 people registered for the five-kilometer race in downtown Washington, according to event organizers. They estimated about $2 million was collected for cancer research and treatment.

I took three big breaks during writing this. See I do have friends.
