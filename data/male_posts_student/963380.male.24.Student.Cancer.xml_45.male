I waged a subtle warfare on the rest of my co-workers, unplugging TV's, muting DVDs, rotating the dial of the receiver in music from "FUCK YOUR BRAIN" to "Hey, that's not so bad." Seriously,  urlLink what the hell is wrong with my co-workers???   I'm thinking of suing the CBC. Or at least, making life incredibly unpleasant for them. A short time ago, they did an "expose" on the extended service packages offered by the place where I work. I wrote a letter to the ombudsman, as I didn't believe the article was well informed, reseached in detail or fair. I received a reply from the ombudsman; he said that he's mainly an appeal authority and that he would be passing my email along to Marketplace. I received an email as a reply from Leslie Peck. Her email basically entailed that  urlLink "yes, our article was well reseached, don't you worry, we've got things under control here" . So, hey, I give you my tax dollars and you tell me, essentially, to bite a wang. So I wrote a strongly worded email to Ms. Peck. It broke down to "yeah, you researched it. Fine. Let me see your research. All of it. Cause if you don't, I'm going to make the biggest stink since King Kong took a shit on the front step of the Empire State Building."  urlLink For fucks sake, these people *work* for me.   There is the small matter of me hating most of the people I work with. It's not a mild dislike. It's not so much a disagreement, or even an agreement to disagree. Fucking hate them with the fire of a thousand suns.  That's all for now, be back later! Smiles and giggles.  Oh yes, the following people are gay: Bill Bignell. That is all.
