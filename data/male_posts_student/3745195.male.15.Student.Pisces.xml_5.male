First off I'm a shy guy so I don't say much, but when I do the "crowd" I'm around always goes silent. I think it's because I have no history with anybody. I just hang out at my house or run or go to basketball tournament/ camps. I don't hang out with anyone which I know is my fault, but I only do it cause I'm afraid of people not liking me. It happened all through MS and I don't want it to happen again... but I also don't want to miss out on stuff. Idk I'm stuck. I really need to find some true friends [sheesh]. Well I'll post again after the party, Until then I'll catch you cats on the flip flop later.
