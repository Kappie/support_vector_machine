Pretence is how i show my love. Happy to chat with you for a few minutes. Maybe even by seeing u somewhere. This proved the fate is created by someone up there. I must not allow the fate to play with my love ones. Does he love me? So how much he loves me? No he don't love me! He now belongs to someone else. I'm too slow... Never appreciate my love, my unrequitted love. But why i always have the feelings that he loves me. just too sensitive on his behaviour towards me. What am i to him? Maybe i just thinking too much.
