This is a wicked song, so I decided to start recording it on my PC using some freeware called Kristal that my mate Sean recommended. I have also started doing a cover of "Soul to Squeeze" by the Red Hot Chilis with Jon my brother doing all the bass guitar for it.  Also today, I did a bit more of my ICT summer homework - But not too much more! I plan to finish it next week. Also next week, me and my mum are going through all the university prospectuses I have collected to narrow down my choices seeing as I will have to complete my UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service for anyone outside of the UK) application form this autumn when I go back to start my final year.  Finally for today's blog; I read an article this morning on how a new search engine start-up company called blinkx could end up being better than Google! I decided I had to go on their site  urlLink www.blinkx.com  to check it out for myself. The results are amazing, all you do is download their software, and it brings up results normally when you search for stuff, but it also searchs your hard drive to bring up relevant information you've already saved on there! This is ideal for if you're writing an essay for school, as it will automatically search the web and your hard disk in the background and bring up all relevant information, including previous school work on the subject of your essay. I definately recommend Blinkx!  Anyway, cya tomorrow!
