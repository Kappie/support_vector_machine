It has drained me financially, and left me weak and feeble.   Now drained physically, mentally and financially, I am beginning on a new chapter of my life. Back to school ! Pursuing a Diploma in Culinary Skills at Shatec. Damn. The uniform makes me look like a nerdish waiter, the textbooks are as thick as the Physics textbook in secondary school, but have to be covered in three measly months, unlike two years in secondary school. But what can I do? I chose the road myself, so I have to grit my teeth and bear through it. I will prove everybody who doubt me, and excel in it.   That was a little intro there, now back to what this page is supposed to be. Waking up early was never easy for me, but today I just got up with ease. Don't bother to ask me, I'm just as bewildered. It was after a quick shower then I got out of house. Daryl called me only after he left home, so he had to wait for me at the Yew Tee Mrt station for me instead. After that, we headed for school! Upon reaching school, he headed for his class while I headed for mine ( Different Course ). I was the first to reach class, and my first lesson was Catering Science. My trainer had the most unique hairstyle in the school man! He's nice, friendly and funny. He talked about the rules and regulations and prohibitions, then made us introduce ourselves one by one. That sucked.   Thirty minutes into the lesson and there was a break, or rather a smoking break to me. After his lesson was IT. Damn! I think that guy is the brother of my secondary school Physics teacher. He has the same surname and last name and talks just like him! Am I so unlucky?! We gotta learn basic IT stuff, ahh... Crap.   It was finally lunch after that. Met Daryl at the kopitiam near the school ( For your info, there's no canteen in Shatec ). Used only ten minutes of my one and a half hour of lunch, then walked around the school aimlessly. At 1, we went to Daryl's class to find no one there, we walked around trying to find his class, then it turned out he didn't check his timetable properly and his class was at another room. Hahaha   It was a three and a half hour lesson after that before school ended, which I finally headed home !
