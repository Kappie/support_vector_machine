Somebody who actually reads the stuff that I post. Okay, so what has been happeneing since I last posted ? Well a few things did crop up.  Firstly work is really getting hectic and my boss is resembling a former Nazi leader with a tooth brush moustache. But it really is exciting, this new project that we are working upon. we have called our project, PROJECT DISHA. Disha stands for direction. What we basically intend to do is to provide a direction to the restless enrgies of the youth today. Other than that I have almost fully recovered from the blast from the past. Had a good discusson with a certain person, last night about it, and am feeling much better now. I have decided that I'm not going to let her hurt me the way she hurt me the last time. My carrer is to important to me to mess around with it. Besides what really put me at ease was what this person told me. He told me that the worst case scenario was that I should come face to face with her. NOw that I think about it, it really is no big deal. Besides she was the one who ditched me, and if anybody should be afraid of this meeting it should be her than me.  But that person also told me something else. Something which I really believed in but had overlooked pehaps. WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON..... Wonder what that means.... Okay gotta run folks. Hope you will come back and read more of me. Besides I am planning to upgrade my site soon. so watch out for an all new MALOYVILLA.
