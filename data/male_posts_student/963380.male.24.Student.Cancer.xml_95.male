My Xbox has been running smoothly since I traded in my chipped model for something a little less illegal. My Ps2 is humming along happily. My gameboy advance sp is doing just fine and shining brightly.  No, the game/system that did it? The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Wanker... er... Waker. As I was beat the multitentacled (aren't they all?) boss of the second fortress (ah... Zelda) The game just froze. Link off to one side of the screen. A piece of heart in the middle. Some little Miyazaki-esque nubbin off to the other side. Me on the couch fucking cursing the cruel god that forced console games into a place where they're shipped like PC games.  This in between using the steam cleaner to suck the pond out of my basement carpet. I hate you Mary-Anne.  Got two boxes of girl guide cookies today. Made with 100% real girlguides. It takes the lotion from the basket and it puts it on it's skin.
