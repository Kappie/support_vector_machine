Yay.. very glad most of the guys were there! really enjoyed their company and of cousre the movie AVP! will try my best to make time for them when i am not soccering. have been a little sick for the past week. sigh.. when am i going to get better? i really don't like the feeling of always having a blocked nose and sore throat!!! I skipped training for like 2 weeks so didn't feel good during training on wednesday, thankful to imran for not getting pissed with me for not running enough even though we were losing. soccer guys all very nice to me even though i always play dissapperaing act with them and hang out alot with my class. very lucky i have such nice dudes in the team. must get better soon so i can resume full training. tip04 singapore leg ended last week.. kinda missing all the wonderful ppl who i hung out with for the past 2 weeks plus. hope that they are all doing fine! we must all study hard so that we all make it to taiwan safely, u guys know what i mean ;) really enjoyed every second spent with you guys, u guys rock!
