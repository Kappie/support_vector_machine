I told Kurt that I watched 'The Ring' and he suggested I see  urlLink 'Ringu'  because he says it's much better.  I am yet to watch the other movie we got out,  urlLink 'Secretary' .  I did a whole lot of nothing today.  Apparently work rang this morning because they were short staffed, but I was asleep.  My mum told them she'd get me to ring them back.  That didn't happen.  I have five books in my amazon shopping cart:  urlLink 'Cunningham's Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs' ,  urlLink 'Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft' ,  urlLink 'The Complete Idiot's Guide to Wicca and Witchcraft' ,  urlLink 'Witchcraft: Theory and Practice'  and  urlLink 'The Complete Book of Incense, Oils  Brews' .  Notice a pattern there?  Now I just need a credit card.   Later:  I just watched 'Secretary'.  It was weird.  It claims to be a comedy, and although it had some comedic moments, it just wasn't.  I'm glad we decided not to watch it on Thursday night.  It has a number of scenes that would have been embarrassing to watch with two girls who have never stayed at my house before.  S+M, masturbation, full frontal nudity ... yeah.
