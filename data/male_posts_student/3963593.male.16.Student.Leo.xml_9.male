I would think that many would be offended by this, they they find it hilarious. I guess the find the attention to their breasts is inescapable, so they just make a big joke about it. The only problem about shirts like this, or shorts that have things written on the butt, if you comment on them the girls that wear them get all pissy, and yell at you for staring at their boobs or ass. Can someone please explain this? Words are such a mish mash of these symbols that we call letters that naturally draw the eye, and then if it says something funny like this one feels compelled to comment. If you hold yourself back, you feel like that u have un finished business, but if you do comment you are at risk at getting yelled at, unless the girl is cool and laughs because she got the article of clothing to be looked at, and that's how it's supposed to be. I guess some people don't get this. People can be really stupid.  urlLink
