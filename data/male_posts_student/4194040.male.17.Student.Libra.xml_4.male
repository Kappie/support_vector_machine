It is one of the most important promises made to God that I have kept."   -Michael Durant   "The commander in the field is always right, and the rear echelon is always wrong, until proven otherwise."   -Colin Powell    "Look back but don't stare"   The above is taken from Michael Durant's book,  In the Company of Heroes.  A highly suggested read for anyone, pick it up sometime or if you want to borrow it send me a message. Definetly worth investing some time in. If you want to see who real heroes are, this is a must read.
