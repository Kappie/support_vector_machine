It was Texas Hold 'em, the wonderful alternative to straight-draw poker, and the game played by the likes of John Moneymaker and Phil Ivey, as well as the Travel Channel's favorite celebrity,  urlLink David the Devil Fish Ulliot .  It was with Brian and a few folks from his work, and we put away a sizeable load of hours and High Life.    Brian bought me in because I had no cash, and no money to speak of.  I was down to $33 in the bank account, a paltry account, and while it's liveable (either my greatest moment or most lowly stratus was making $7 stretch four days back in August 2001), it allows no true wiggle room.  Brian threw in $10 for me, a great act of kindness from a guy who sells pies and poor quality pot roast for a living.  And with every intention of paying him back on a later date, I played like it wasn't my money, because if I played like it was, I would have lost immediately.  I won some sizeable hands, got Brian's $10 back to him, and ended up with nearly $40 after paying Brian back at one time.  But it was late, I had $19 of it in my pocket that I wasn't going to touch, and there were just three of us left.  I was playing with a pair of 9s, and the show cards only offered a king pair higher...there was a pair of 2s on the pitch that I wasn't worried about.  Brian had been betting high all hand, and I knew he didn't have the kings...it was my money.  We got the pot near $45, $19 of it mine.  Turns out Brian was holding a little deuce on his own, and the river card bought him the pot.   Three weeks ago, Daniel Young and I talked about how socioeconomic status is a strong determinant of where you get in life.  Or, to better set the scene, I talked about it, and Daniel disagreed.  It started with race, and why prisons held a majority of african americans when in the US, african americans make up maybe 16% of citizens.  Since race is not genetic, I tried to take him on a metaphorical search for the root of the problem (which I believe lives in US infrastructure, our cultural hegemony).  We didn't make it too far...Daniel discussed motivation, and how he notices the lack of motivation to do better among the african american workers at the hospital he does his interning at.  I was willing to go where he wanted to go, as the topic holds great importance in my mind, and if I can maybe get him to see another perspective on an issue, maybe he can take his longing for helping others and put it in a social context.    Not in this conversation, though.  I went with the lack of opportunities approach, saying that the money we had when we were younger enabled us to see the opportunities of a free market economy, the opportunities of a social dress show, and the opportunities of living in general.  We did extracurricular activities, played musical instruments, and did well in school because a premium was put on our success.  While we are the ones who are pursuing it now, and our motivation is a reason we are where we are, I made the argument that it is not  the  reason he's in med school and I'm in grad school, and we're both on our ways to trying to make our dreams come true.  He countered with motivation again, saying he got where he is because he worked for it, and his family might have money, but they never bought success for him, and they didn't flaunt wealth in any way.  And it's a good argument; when I was a kid, in no way did I think my parents were doing anything for me...I was my own boss, and I was successful because of me.  And that's the memory I have.    But I see it differently now.  I've been poor.  Not poor in the college student sense of the word, where I bemoan my monetary situation, meaning I can't go out to eat because then I can't buy the CD I've wanted for a week.  In August 2001, I had $7 to my name, four days until payday, and three eggs in the fridge.  I hadn't spent the money extravagently...extravagent spending stopped April 2001, when I somehow came to the cold realization that I wasn't going to have free rent and free food anymore when I left Centenary...I was going to have to leave Centenary, and the cash I was dropping taking people out might benefit me when I move out on my own, as Austin isn't ready just yet to take me for a free dinner.  But bills were bills, and bills were unforgiving.  I realized that people charge you for electricity and water, not to mention waste management.  Trying to save by typical convention netted small virtues; even grocery food was expensive if you wanted to turn a chicken breast into a meal.  The entertainment budget of undergrad, which was near 90% of my budget in its Shreveport heyday, hadn't existed since my Texas sojurn began.    Today, when I started my morning, I didn't realize I would get my windfall of cash on Wednesday.  So I was preparing crisis mode, and figuring out how the $33 in the bank, mixed with the $19 I had in pocket, could get me to the 25th, my payday from Duke.  And I remembered how crisis mode was back in 2001, where my days off from work consisted of waking up, eating some sort of noodles, walking to school, grabbing a paper, sitting and reading the paper and doing the crossword, heading to the PCL to check email and see the fat Sonny Bono security guard (one of my favorite Austin landmarks), playing grabass there, walking around a bit, heading to the apartment, and either 1) If the Padres were on, streaming the Padres game on the computer and trying to write screenplays, or 2) going to Borders and reading.    The one thing about crisis mode that's worth pondering is the amount of time I had to write.  With no money, there was nothing but writing to be done...it was a productive use of my time, and it was what I wanted to be doing, so without gadgety destractions, I figured I would make mad progress on my works.  But I didn't write a thing...or a  good  thing.  Because I was worried.  Worried about where I'd eat next.  Worried if a tire blew on the car, or something went wrong and I got towed accidentally, or if the gas in my car wasn't enough to get me to and from work for the next four days.  Time was not a problem, but mentally I couldn't get past the knowledge that if one small thing went wrong (and up to that point, everything had gone wrong in Austin), I was totally fucked.    But I was never totally fucked.  I've got rich grandparents.  They are bastards about money, always offering me money if I need it, but any time I take them up on the offer I get lectured about balancing a budget, and taking care of my finances, and learning how to live as a responsible adult.  And it's a fair argument, because I do spend needless money.  I have my vices.  I write best when I'm out at a coffee shop or a bookstore, and that usually costs $3 or so.  A month of those is near $100, and that's saying I never buy a bagel there.  I love Panda Express' greased-up orange chicken.  I eat it when I should eat in.  I buy a ton of books.  I play EverQuest.  I have this website.  Nothing too extravagant, but unnecessary.    And here's where the upbringing comes back into play.  First, I had the support all throughout my childhood, told I could do whatever I wanted.  I wanted to be an actor, and everyone supported me.  Then I wanted to be a writer, and everyone said acting sucked, and I was going to be the best writer I could.  My family bought me whatever I needed when I said I needed it...they wouldn't buy me a computer, but I'd get books on writing, or writing software, tablets of paper, and boxes of pens with cushy grips.  And when I came to Palm Springs, the grandparents gave me a show!  We'd put on our long pants, gaet in the Lexus, drive slowly down Palm Canyon, windows down, glasses on, throwing the turn signal at the perfect moment to make that pop crisp sound as you start the wheel left.  We'd dine at a restaurant on the drag, a bistro with well-groomed waiters and busboys, immaculate water refills, and menus that didn't list coin.  Afterwards, they'd insist on cake and ice cream, and maybe a movie, or a trinket from the street fair.  Anything to help me relax.  I'm not writing to blame my grandparents for my inability to make an $18,000/year budget comfortable living.  Before I got out of college, I prepared a budget, looking at the expenses I expected in Austin.  I took that, mixed it with a comfortable entertainment and food budget, and found that I could save $2500 a year if I made $12/hr, or roughly $24,000/yr (pre-taxes).  Not much, I don't think.  Hell, $30,000/year seems scandalous.  But I've never come close to that original budget, only approaching it now that it's half loan money and half my TA job.  I live on $18,000 fine.  I've lived on less.  And I've lived comfortably enough to not worry about whether I can afford beer after catching a film.  But I haven't found a way to live where the lifestyle keeps my mind alive, but also saves money.  I write well not when I'm relaxed, which usually comes when I'm busy, but must come when I'm not worried.  My writing in Palm Springs was shit this summer, mostly owing to the pressure of the family to hide my dad's alcoholism, and to see me, the fallow child, succeed in his graduate endeavors.  Every time I'd plug the trusty laptop in and fire up Final Draft, Gran V. would enter with a Coke and her paper.   Don't mind me,  she said,  I'm just going to finish the paper.   We sat.  I typed a bit.  Within two minutes, she would always find an article she thought was interesting, and she'd talk about it, and I wasn't going to be rude, because I was there to visit her, so I'd talk too, and ten minutes would pass and she'd apologize for keeping me from writing, and then quickly ask how it was going, and say how proud she was, and how she wanted to look at something, and then she'd mention my dad for some reason, and the moment was gone, the laptop closed, and I'd head to the bathroom to sit and look at the writer they were talking about.
