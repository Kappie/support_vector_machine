I am slowly trying to work out what i have missedin the days i've been gone butthis is going to take a while. All sub-blogs are going to be slowly updated, especialy movie and bookreviews, but friday feeling will consist of mainly old news for some of you as i am going to post the best of the weeks i have been gone. If youve got a problem with that i'll be happy to deal with it outside. Oh well. Got lots of photos to show and tell. Will come soon.  byeeeeee
