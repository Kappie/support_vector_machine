I've written so far:  602 - 5 / 30  603 - 6 / 7  690F - 13 / 15 : completed 2 pages today  Total - 24 / 52 = 46.1% completed with 14 more days to go.   But yea... writing on campus is a helluva lot more productive than at home. I'm also wondering if these Macs play DVDs... I could watch my Netflix movies here. Hmm... then my subscription won't go to waste in this last week.  I wish I could listen to  Rancid 's "Salvation" and the  Descendents ' "Suburban Home" right now.  Inspiration for my paper.  I'm going to go and copy stuff for 697 right now, go home and have dinner, and then come back to get more shit done. I also plan on baking some cookies tonight.  ***
