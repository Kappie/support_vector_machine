I find it incredible just how long I can remain stationary for hours on end. Usually, I have attention deficit disorder-like symptoms, and other times I'm perfectly patient. Funny how it works out that way. Are you wondering about the title? Well, normally, people say, "bless you" when someone sneezes; so, being the good agnostic that I am, decided to go the extra mile and say it in German (because, you know, that makes  so  much sense). What am I doing now, you ask? Nothing, same as all day. I merely figured that since I did not take the time to make an entry yesterday, I ought to make up for it now. _My blog is pretty plain, wouldn't you say? I was thinking of redesigning the template, but I'm far too lazy. Onto another subject: I have a friend, A.J., who is working scientifically to eliminate all contractions from his speech (e.g., "don't," "I'm," etc.). I was thinking of doing the same earlier on, not to seem pompous and stilted, but simply for the sake of being more articulate. However, as I have worked on this ongoing project of mine (a literary work, hardly worth a second-glance), the people have no contractions, and I have stumbled upon situations where the phrasing, no matter the syntax, sounds so awkward that it almost  requires  the contraction to even read correctly. Speaking of that ongoing project. I haven't told you about it, huh? Well, it's sort of this thing I do. I don't know why, the story feeds itself into my mind. I've developed this complex world with intricately-woven stories that I thought I might try to write down, in case I forget it. When I grew older, I became interested in Manga and Anime; so I thought, "Hey! why not try to turn it into a webcomic! :D" How foolish... And yet, I still pursue that whim. In any case, most of the time spent in front of the computer today was for the specific reason of writing. Nothing truly flowed out, but I am now deep into the third chapter, page 98 (1 pg. = a half, landscape 8x10 page). I figure if I write about 15 chapters with 36 pages per chapter, I'll be at 540 pages by the end of ONE of the three major stories. _Now that that's settled, about today? Well, earlier this morning, I woke up around 6:30 AM, turned of the clock/radio, and woke up again at about 8AM. So, I put on my everything, and get ready. My paternal parental unit asked me earlier if our track coach made us sprinters run with weights like dumbells, and although we didn't, I took it into consideration for my summer training. Seeing as I really,  really  want my 400m time to go down, I thought I ought to test the idea. I took my mom's pregnant-lady-but-used-for-physical-therapy dumbells (5 lb. each) and headed out. [One thing that really bugs me: the key doesn't slip into the lock the same as it used to before, and it makes a lot of noise]. I didn't bring my CD player this time because it was jigglin' all over the place the time before. So, I walk down my hill, and start running. OUCH! Even though they were just five pounds each, it slowed me down considerably, made it difficult to breath. I dunno, maybe I'm just a wuss, but it was definitely strenuous. That was the approximate makeup of my day. Not so interesting, ne? So goes the story of my life. Perhaps something amazing, someday, will happen to me like the people in my story.
