I never seem to fit everything I need to do in a day in a day.  The previous sentence may make no sense to you, but I think differently.  Anyhow, I'm busy all the time and barely get 6 hours of sleep a day.  Starting tomorrow, I hope to change that somewhat because it is a short day.  It's not a half-day of school or anything of sort.  It is short because it's the day before a game practice and we normally have short practice.  I'm looking forward to getting home early and being able to relax for a short time then work on homework and stuff.  I'm not sure how that will work out though, because I'm always tired when I get home no matter what day.  I am looking forward to basketball right now for only one reason -- practice is only around two hours.  I don't mean to say I don't like football, because I do, it's just that I don't seem to be learning all that much or actually making myself a better player in that long practice.  I'm not sure why, but I don't seem to see how drills and such help all the time.  Maybe it's just me.  I don't think I am, by all means, the best player out there nor do I think I try the hardest.  Motivation, perhaps but my life right now is kind of in a slump.  Long days with little sleep don't exactly put me in much of any good mood by the time I get home.  I feel like I've already said that around four times.  Elsewhere, my life is busy.  The only real day where I don't have much to do is Saturday, which I still have the weekly chores etc.  Still those chores compared to the rest of the days, is not much.  Fridays and Saturdays transpose my sleep time.  I stay up very late on Friday night and sleep until noon.  Stay up until 2 and sleep until 10 or so.  I suppose I could say I lack any consistency.  I really don't have much to say about that.  It's quite late, and I really do need to go to bed because I must get up early to go in and work on some homework corrections.  That sounds like great fun.  I wish though, that I could put myself into a good mood when I wake up in the morning.  I never seem to be fully awake when doing anything in the morning.  I suppose that's why I can actually go in early and get things done because everything's going through my subconscious.  That or I'm just babbling.  Good night.
