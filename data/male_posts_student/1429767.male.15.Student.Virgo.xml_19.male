When I知 curled up next to nothing Where are you when a breeze blows through? And I知 desperately needing something?  Alone is the word that describes my life When I知 living it with out you All that could be good and make me smile Only dims in the light of the truth What good in enjoying a movie If I知 not cuddled in your embrace? What good are late nights or early mornings If they don稚 end and begin with your face?  The realization of your absence is intensified And normal activities hold new meaning Every trial I endure and every victory I win I find myself wishing that you were seeing If luck should caste me a favorable lot Can I really rejoice without your presence? And if my life should turn for the worse Is not the pain numbed in the wake of your absence?  Light floods my room in the morning And the emptiness of being alone The warmth does not quiet reach my heart And even in brightness my pain is shown Where are you when the day shines through And I wake up clinging to no one Where are you when a breeze blows through And I知 desperately needing someone?
