I had dinner tonight at the home of a cousin of mine in Newton.  I mention this mostly because I think he's probably going to search the Internet to see if he can find my weblog, since it came up in conversation.  The food was awesome.  It always is.  His wife's a fantastic cook.  If you're my cousin, and you've found my weblog, welcome... :)  (If not, welcome anyway...)     Speaking of things that aren't related to law school... Check out  urlLink Steve Hofstetter's weblog  if you like.  I went to high school with Steve, and he writes a weekly humor column called Observational Humor.  We've sort of lost touch (I should probably e-mail him), so he has no reason to know I read his column, or that I have a weblog of my own.  But maybe if I link to him, he'll see in his referrer logs that people are coming to his site from my site and he'll come check this one out and then I'd have an actual reason to e-mail him.  Although who doesn't like getting e-mail.  ...and now back to your regularly scheduled humorous thoughts about law school...
