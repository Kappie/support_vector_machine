I know i asked her to tell that guy not to msg her that often.. but i thought about it.. if i tell her to say that, it will make him think i am a loser and scared that i will lose her to him.. guess what the guy say.. it is his right to msg my girl as much as he wants.. what cheek.. dun he know that she is my darling and that she is off limits?? And.. she told me.. she thinks i dun care for her as much.. i also dunno why she will think that way.. i know that i love her.. i trust her, and i know that she loves me too, even though lately, she haven been telling me how she feels, if she loves me, miss me.. or whatever..  Yesterday, i almost quarrelled with her, just because i didn't tell her that i went for soccer and made her worry.. when i came home, i kinda answered her rudely.. i didn't think of what she would be thinking.. later on, i regretted, and i called her... she just told her smth which i didn't catch.. and i hung up.. i was upset.. she didn't give me a chance to explain myself or apologise.. but in the end, it's all okay, and i am glad..  today, we went for a movie and to take photos.. spiderman 2.. suddenlt, it seems that i need to behave myself.. keep my hands to myself... like she isn't my gf.. but just a female friend.. and i cannot touch her.. every kiss, every hug.. nv lasted for more than half a min.. haiz.. is it that i think too much.. or is it that we're really drifting apart.........
