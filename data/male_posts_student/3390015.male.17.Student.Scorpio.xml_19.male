We drove to the airport, flew out of Tampa, landed in Chicago, shopped, saw homeless people...including the infamous "Buckets" [the guy on the bridge playing the bucket drums...He goes "ratta-tat-tat -spare change!-ratta-tat-tat {classic}], stayed at an awesome hotel, rented a car, drove to Iowa, stayed with grandparents, ate at the canteen which is located under a parking garage, went to some garage sales, grandma made bad eggs and I got sick, drove up to the Twin Cities, met cousins, played drums {didn't go too well, but I had some moments of brilliance}, played volleyball, had TONS of fun, drove to Grandma's, went to Half-Price books {the coolest bookstore on the planet} and bought a new Bible and some other books, ate like there was no tomorrow, went up to the North Shore, stayed in an awesome resort on Lake Superior, went sea-kayaking and hiking {kayaking is awesome!}, drove down to Duluth Minnesota, toured this giant ship that transported iron ore, saw an IMAX flick, drove back to the Twin Cities, went garage saleing there {didn't find a thing, people had lots of crap}, ate like there was no tomorrow again, drove to Chicago, flew back to Tampa, then drove home.  Whoa...  We drove around 2000 miles, flew around 2200 miles.  I also read a ton of books, reading approximately a page for every two miles we drove, just as reference. These are the books I read:  1.  Mere Christianity  - C.S. Lewis 2.  Reasons  {skeptics should consider christianity} - Josh McDowell 3.  The Screwtape Letters  - C.S. Lewis [only 33 pages] 4.  The Signature of God  - Grant Jeffrey [pretty good, some questionable material] 5.  Four Views on the Book of Revelation  - Various - [now I know all the angles, I would say I'm probably a "classical dispensationalist"] 6.  On the Seventh Day  - Various - [only 83 pages, good, but "In Six Days" the first one, was way better] 7.  Legacy  - Rich Lowry - [A great Clinton bashing! -- only 215 pages]  More later, and maybe pictures!
