It's really hard to accept when somebody you know really well reveals their true side. Somebody you idealize and look up to can shock you in a matter of moments, everything you think you knew flies out the window. And it kills you when it happens.      Jimmy is the guy that it's hard not to look up to. He is a great musician, sportsman, singer, friend, lady's man and is always up for a laugh. He's always looking out for people, and gets a lot of friends with his 'quick-to-smile' nature and his jokes. He always makes you feel as if you're the only one in on everything he says, and he makes you feel special, which is what bring the ladies running.      When I first heard of Jimmy's little escapades, I just put them aside. "Liz just upset that he said no to her, its natural for her to feel that way" I thought. Then I heard about how cruel he was to her. Saying that when you like somebody and they don't like you back is 'Liz-itis'. How demeaning! As if she didn't feel bad enough, the poor girl! And they way he goes on and on about it, slowly punching and kicking her self-esteem until its on the ground, crying and alone. How could he do such a thing to somebody who loved him?! How could he even  THINK ABOUT IT ?! She's such a beautiful person, so fragile and yet it's like he's taken to her with a sledgehammer, beating her till she's  BLEEDING AND SCREAMING AND HE DOESN'T CARE!!!!!!       It's even worse what he did to Megan. She's head over heels for him, and he KNOWS it. So he blows her off for some floozy with big tits that he thinks he can score with. When  THAT  doesn't work, he comes crawling back to her, saying he's up for some "casual fun"! Does he have  NO RESPECT ?! She bloody hates herself already, has no fucking idea who she is or what she should do and he comes over looking for a cheap root?!  WHAT THE FUCK IS HIS PROBLEM?!  How he has the  AUDACITY  to even ASK!! She's awake at night, every night, thinking about him. Going over things in her mind, making up fantasies where he's the good guy and he takes her in his arms and loves her! She obsesses over him, and all says is "you may as well, its the closest you're going to get". How could he say  THAT?!       Megan's a beautiful girl, and she thinks she's  NOTHING ! She said to me, "I hang around him, and I put myself down for him and compliment him". And he goes and starts with other chicks?!  What is wrong with him ?!      The worst thing is, I see him and I see how he's  hurt the girl I love  and  killed  her inside. It tears me apart slowly, I want to  punch  him and  shout  at him and tell him how much  I HATE WHAT HE'S DONE AND I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW BUT I CANT!!!!  I see him and I just see what everyone else sees. A nice guy. The guy I idealized. I  can't  hate him, and I know how Liz's hurting and she hates him but she's like me! She can't hate him either! He's got an aura that you can't penetrate, a hold over everyone. He has this way of talking that sounds like he understands you and wants to help you. Even now, while writing this I can see him and I can't see the  monster  that's destroyed these two girls. I see the guy that I wanted to be, and it hurts me.      He'll go though life, and it'll unfold before him. It'll lay things at his feet and he can take them as he pleases because he can do WHATEVER HE WANTS AND NOBODY WILL STOP HIM.  Whatever  he wants,  whoever  he wants,  whenever  he wants and nobody can do a thing. I feel scared about it, because of this power. The scariest part though is the fact that even if they know, even if they know what kind of person he is, nobody will do anything. They can't. He owns me, he owns Megan and Liz and everyone. Even if you could break it and say something, nobody will do anything. They won't believe you (or won't want to believe you).      These people exist, and there's nothing we can do about it. It's like taking that final look at reality and ' doing a Winston' .  "I love Big Brother".
