That thought was pretty wrong, at least thats how it looks now. I met jojo, she's a pretty crazy girl. I was out all last night jus kickin it, an chillin. It was probly the closest thing to how i chilled in edmonton. we just met up with some ppl and it went from there. looks like niagra falls may show a bit of promise after all. guess only time will tell from here...
