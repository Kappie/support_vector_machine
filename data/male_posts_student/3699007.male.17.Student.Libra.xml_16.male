Thanks for getting me a job there, uncle Bob. And you can work whenever you want to, as much as you want to, so it won't interfere with football season. My dad came home from work today and has a stomach virus, so now I've locked myself in my room trying not to catch it. I've been so bored over the past 2 or 3 days with Britt goneuntil saturdayand Amie having Adam at her house for 2 weeks.  I really don't have anything to write, thus, not many updates lately. I'm sitting here downloading songs for a CD for Nicole. Damn shame she lives like 200 yards from me and we never hang out or anything. She is my ride to school this year, though, hopefully. Maybe I'll get a parking place, but I doubt it. No way I'll get that lucky.
