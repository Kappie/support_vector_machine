But since nobody gives Tyke comments on what is better anyway, he will just go with his gut on this one.  So today started well with Tyke getting a good deal of talking done in his math class.  Tina and Karla were good company as usual.  Tyke felt on fire the whole day really...he was just spittin out some great one-liners and letting the good times roll.  Nothing really good comes to mind but it's enough so that you all can know that it was indeed funny (iwif).  But the rest of the day progressed smoothly.  Lunch was awesome today.  There were many a person there.  Tina, Purdy, Dotti, Kinker, Dr. Phil, Macaroon, Fejj, K-caj, etc.  Well Tyke sat with Purdy, Tina, and Dotti mainly and talked to them.  Oh, and Shawna was there too by the way.  But they didn't talk much.  Oh but Tyke did talk about how he was excited for HaikuFest04!!!  That is gonna be awesome.  He announced today he is gonna write 2 haikus about his wonton and one about Tina.  And yeah, Tina was there when he said that.  She asked Purdy who Tina was and then Purdy told Tina who Tina was.  So Tina knows Tina.  So yeah, thats kinda...out there and all.  Not to mention the whole text of this blog.  Yeah, pretty sure she (you if it is Tina who is reading this) has read this.  So, sorry might be the right word to say.  Or maybe, well that's how Tyke feels/felt.  Well, damn this might be stupid to say but Tyke feels the need to sorta explain something about this little situation he has felt.  Purdy told Tyke today at the Phys Review that Tina had read the blog and was a little freaked out by it (or maybe a lot freaked out, Tyke can't remember).  Well, right away Tyke's heart sunk.  He really feared that he had done something horrible.  He was thinking of the worst and what if they became awkward or she didn't want to ever be around Tyke.  That was a really scary feeling.  Not one he wants to feel again.  And that is why he is timid in writing all of this.  Because he is unaware if this is getting too personal for the ones that are mentioned in this primarily.  There is really only one person who could "take offense" to the comments in this blog.  And that would be Tina.  Cuz Tyke says some pretty serious and meaningful things.  And because this is public and just a totally un-private forum for these discussions.  But this is, as he has said before is just infotainment.  Information presented through a media forum that promotes interesting modicums of events (not a good usage of modicums but a great word nonetheless).  Tyke uses his blog to entertain the general public but he does so by amalgamating fact and interesting rambles to make a highly attractive "broadcast."  Damn talking online while writing this...Tyke keeps bouncing from here and other conversations so now he keeps forgetting what he was talking about here.  So let's just say that Tyke is sorry for any pain or a lack of comfort after reading these entries.  Maybe he should have a disclaimer before the text.  Like, The views herein expressed are mostly that of the author yet they do not intend to inflict any emotional damage to any person, especially female.  Proceed with caution.  Tyke is now going to talk about one of the best parts of his blog.  Namedropping.  Purdy, Haras, Kinker, Quesa.  Those four finebodied females and male were one hell of a physics review group.  Quesa doesn't read this so no need to mention her anymore but if she does read it, HERE SHE IS!!!!  However, Purdy, Haras, and Kinker do read it.  And there is nothing like being shown, if only glimpsed on something seen by lots of people.  That brings Tyke to another point before he talks about those people.  Tyke was on TV today.  Multiple times actually.  If you remember back to when Tyke first did his CE he went to a frat house at UW as his mentor was doing a story there and Tyke got used as a "frat guy" shooting pool.  So he was in both the teaser and a part of the actual clip.  Now it wasn't like he said anything or even actually made eye contact with the camera but he was still on camera some.  He was told to just shoot some pool when the camera rolled past him and the first time they did that he made 2 balls in and almost a 3rd.  But then that take wasn't great so they did a new one.  And this one Tyke totally botched it and the ball bounced off two sidepockets, almost a scratch.  And it made a bad noise.  But still, he was on TV and you weren't so (tongue sticking out noise with frowny eyes).  But back to people you know.  Tyke and Purdy were texting each other when Tyke was at home and he talked about how he dreams of seeing her in her one-piece for work and how hot she is and ya know, just the truth and all (no seriously it's the truth...or is it? well it could be either but since you aren't Tyke you don't know and since sometimes Tyke just says stuff for the comedic value you really don't know!!!!).  But yeah, those were good times.  And Haras and Tyke talked about...well not that much actually.  They talked about how Tyke can say just stupid things and they will be funny to Haras.  Haras is sooo awesome.  It is really great when you can be sooo stupid and inane but then even though it may not be funny to anyone else, that one person still finds it funny.  Haras is that one person.  And she is really nice so it is a double decker bus like the ones you see in England.  Not the ones you see in Washington (cuz there are none).  See, right there...that was probably pretty stupid but Haras is just so cool that it might have made her snicker to read.  Oh, and not to take anything away from Purdy or Dotti cuz they too laugh at stupid stuff of Tyke's and they also are reallly nice and super cool.  Haras, Purdy, and Dotti, are all tied for like the top spot in Tyke's black book (this black book is actually just a figure of speech and also it does not mean like past girlfriends or anything but he would date them...don't doubt that).  But still it is great to have super awesome friends.  And they are hot.  Purdy was pretty mcHOT today with her sexyyy new haircut and dressy-wear.  Haras was her usual gorgeous self and made every guy turn his head as she walked by.  Dotti was absolutely stunning decked out in Ross-wear with an UNBELIEVABLY fabulous pink backpack.  This buxom beauty can certainly get a rise out of the crowd.  Line might have been crossed with that last one.  Which probably means that this should be a quit for this blog.  Amed did his job again today, whatever that was.  And Kinker is really good at knowing what Tyke means to say and also he and Tyke make up great acronyms and stuff and can figure them out real quicklike.  Super fast like.  Tyke is about to P now too.  See, Kinker will prolly get that one too.  Go COUGS!!!
