If any of you ever watched Renee Zelwegger receive an award and thought, "Who the hell is John Carabino?" the answer is, he's her manager. Not her personal self-esteem booster as I had previously conjectured.  I've seen Finding Nemo now. It rocks. Also, I have convinced my dad to watch Chicago. He hasn't yet, but he will.  Nothing ruins an evening at the movies like being struck down by the wrath of God.
