But if you have, then you should know what I'm talking about if you're not Freddy Kruger.  The point that I'm trying to make is that Starfox is fucking creepy. Not the N64 version, but the original. I mean, come on, those voices scare the shit out of me. Not to mention that psycho music that sounds like somebody with a chain saw is about to cut your head off.  If I ever grow up to be a jackass, I'm gonna make my kids play Starfox as a punishment so that they'll have nightmares.
