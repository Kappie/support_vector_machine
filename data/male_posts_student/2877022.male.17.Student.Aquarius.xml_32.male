I'm wearing the NJC IGNIS HOUSE T-shirt.  Ultimate PRA day, i was slacking at noon, playing caram (dunno how to spell) with nus. She was FANTASTIC! I bet she only has the "No way i would lose" look for such petty games. Come on, challenge me with the same attiude for mugging. HUH! Stare at me during Econ for wad??!!?? HUH??!!! I reckon if I wanna ignite a fight from a staring incident with someone, this person would most probably be nus. Juz kidding.  Sianz.... i was so "suay" to be in the chem 41 class. The 5I people are so slow lor. All the 5As spent at least 30 minutes to idle around, if not, gossiping before the 5Is finished their work. Cant tahan the teacher, pathetically slow in her teaching pace. Lucky we protested to be released earlier, if not we would be trapped there till 5pm.  -When a dermentor approach you, what must you say?-  ===  Expecto Patronum ===  this is the WRONG answer. Correct answer:  "No Smint, no kiss"
