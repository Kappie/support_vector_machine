I have been busy dying in a flurry of English literature essays, Biology enzyme papers, and Calculus...er...calculations. But Calculus, despite the constant vigilance it requires, goes rather well methinks. I find it quite enjoyable, to the dismay of several of my colleagues.  Becca and I spoke today about significant figures in chemistry, because significant figures are    THE MOST VAGUE    sectors of science in general. She figured them out without my assistance. I was useless (oh well).  I can see Elise and Laylee daily now! Indeed, I am permitted to see Elise early in the morning at school because I get to the school building earlier, and I may see Laylee following lunch period C when she is leaving AP English and I am heading towards mathematics. Happiness, I daresay.  I should like to post a prompt poem that is utterly crap. I posted it on DOY because Alanna demanded that I do, and I dare not deny her. But it is crap. The prompt was "[   ] is a lazy hush fuck", "Danish cookies", and "NOOOOOOOOOOOO" (count the O's damnit, they count!)  This thing got 74 comments. But a majority of them were the ramblings of Sirs Jerel and Nick of California. I am confused with Sally, so some people might think of me as female. But I am not! I am male! I won't prove it right now, but take my word for it.   All around the world in 180 days My little book swept me off Feet grounded in a puddle of calculations Broom, I’m a witch sorcerer Paths of oxygen to six, seven continents Spiraling past the airplane window And a little child presses his nose to the plastic Makes a face Skip from North America to Peru Ziggurat steps climbing Arch over the stone cold apex My stomach’s talking to me – snow cones Fly over to Antarctica, scoop Another scoop, frozen rain Hopscotch up the eastern coast of Africa Flying carpets are popular now – cheap Greasy salesmen in turbans and sunglasses Times never change My brain cries, Danish cookies Zip up to England for tea time and Buttery crumpets Hover over Japan for an hour or two Neon maze Sushi fish, sushi rice! Little Japanese men make a computer chip And cry “NOOOOOOOOOOOO…” When their exhale snaps the silicon Let’s sit over the Arctic circle Earth’s attic Not time to return to school Never, never again To listen to the teacher, he’s a lazy Hush fuck, hush puppy fuck Rambling For a century about a century When some obscure dude from – where? Drew steel Ramble, ramble, no course or preamble Just like these lines.   By the way, the prompt was constructed by lovely Morgan of DOY.  I am an alien. Elise says so. I am also an Elizabethan Greek. Because Elise says so, and don't argue with Elise lest she smite you utterly.  Cheers, humans.
