I mean, we only have two--count, TWO--days of school this week, cold weather is settling in, which  really  makes it seem like Christmas, and I've got the greatest friends in the world.  Seriously.  Recently, I've kind of been questioning where I stand with my four best friends.  One I rarely get to see during the day because we have zero classes together, another is caught up in big theatre decisions, another I rarely get to see because I only have one class with him, and the last is one with whom I've felt pretty secure for quite a while now simply because we see each other and hang out a lot.  Now, though, I really think things are going to be okay.  This Christmas, Katie, Jenny, Alec, Emily, and I are going to go get our picture taken with Santa Claus, which will be a lot of fun.  I can't wait for that.  This spring we're going to go get professional pictures done so that we can have some good pictures to put in our senior ad that we're going to put in the yearbook next year.  I can't wait!  Besides, I went to lunch for the first time in weeks today (instead of going to the newspaper room), and everyone was really warm and welcoming.  It made me get that warmed-over-gummy-bears kind of feeling, and that was really cool.  The great thing is that everywhere I turn, I have friends.  I'm walking to newspaper, there's Alyssa, my editor-in-chief, tugging my bag and asking how I"m doing; I'm going to my locker, there's Rachel helping me out in a little financial jam; I'm feeling down, there's Patrick ready to play twosies, threesies, and even up to sixies.    And I say again, life...is...good.
