LoL Mikey went with my parents up there to pick me up. After we got back to my house I took a shower and him and I went to eat out at Golden China. I looooove that place! My fav. place to eat! After that, we came back to my house and sat there for awhile, then him and I took Cat and Nate out to watch a movie. We watched Dodgeball. It was an o.k. movie, kinda perverted but pretty funny at some parts. Yup, well, today I went and talked to the guy at United,(the one by Wal-Mart) he told me he'd call me later when I knew what my decision was for sure. I definately want the job, but then again I would have to work on Sundays, and it would be after church, but that's still going against all that I believe. I dunno.. we'll see. Other than that, I gotta work tonight at 5...Pizza Pro. Hehe, I think I might even get paid since I wasn't here on Wednesday to get paid! Cha Ching! :D LoL Well g2g! Adios! ~ChRiStIn
