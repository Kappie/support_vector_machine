I think I've finally boiled down the equation I'm trying to find the answer to, but I can't rationalize my missing link.  Basically, my equation for whether Christianity is true is "God exists" --> "Jehovah is God" --> "Christ is Jehovah."  Based upon evidence, I accept the first premise via the Creation Complexity and First Mover arguments and the third based upon prophecies.  But the second is where I can't find an answer; how can I be sure that Jehovah is the one true God?  In a society which embraces theological relativism, I have become saturated with the sense that "anything is ok."  I hesitate to say that someone else is wrong because I fear that they may be right (and, likewise, I wrong), a hesitation fundamentally founded upon my fear that Jehovah is not God (or at least, the only one true God).  In relation to this dilemma, I was thinking about how things can be proven today.  The method that we have all been taught in school is empirically, i.e. scientific investigation.  A closely related method is rational process, i.e. that something "makes sense" based upon available evidence and/or formal logical formulas.  I think that most of my theological search thus-far has been heavily reliant upon these two methodogies, especially the rational process.  However, due to the inherent nature of spiritual realities and the whole "faith-thing," this is extraordinarily frustrating for two reasons:  first, spiritual things can't be proven empirically, and second, virtually anything can be "proven" via rational process if you begin with the right premises (just take my word on this).  However, there is another form of "proving" something which better lends itself to the nature of beliefs - relational dynamics.  Boiled down, this basically says that if you believe something you actually live according to what you hold, and if someone you know believes the same thing, you help them live that way, too - the cliche words for this are "being real" and "accountability."  However, as my name for this concept insinuates, the dynamics of this process are relational - you have to be able to see how someone lives their life to see whether they live according to their beliefs, and you have to have some sort of relationship with the person if they are going to help you stick to what you (plural) believe.  The more you see of someone's life, the greater they "prove" their example by their faithfulness to their beliefs; likewise, the more effectively someone helps another live according to a shared belief set, the more the belief set is "proven" by demonstrating a shared commitment to its principles.  While the "formal" methods of proving something taught in schools, the relational process is something that we inherently know simply by being human.  Anyone who participates in debate or rational investigation will tell you that an argument is not invalidated simply because the person who presents it does not live by what they are espousing; perhaps this is true in an abstract sense, but it certainly is not true in the "real world."  The way that one lives is the strongest proof that what one says is true; as St. Francis of Assissi (sp?) once said, "Share the Gospel every day; if necessary, use words."  In this relational sense I feel as though I have a genuine paucity of "evidence."  Right now, the people that I used to look up to as spiritual leaders (especially my parents) have largely abdicated whatever "accountability" function they had with me, and in many cases aren't even necessarily living according to what they espouse.  Quite simply, this has been devastating; hypocrisy breads questions, questions without answers spur doubt, and doubt ferments into denial.  I fear that I am well along this road; I feel like the father in Mark who exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!" Underneath all this doubt is a once-solid foundation which continues to hold, but what once was a stalwart in my life is quickly crumbling  and I feel powerless to stop the deterioration; like the boy at the dike, there are only so many holes you can plug on your own.  Of course, there isn't really anyone else "coming alongside" who I feel I can trust with my doubts, fear, reservations, and questions, no one who can demonstrate to me the "right way."  Honestly, it doesn't even necessarily have to be someone who is more "advanced" than I spiritually or whatnot; as on an athletic team, sometimes growth is  best spurred by individuals who begin from the same place and grow together.  But what is going on now can't continue; a lot of people can tell me what they think is the "right way," but who will show me that they believe what they say, who will stick with me when I take a wrong step and have to work to get back to right?
