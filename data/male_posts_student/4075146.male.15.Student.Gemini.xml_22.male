Anyway, make sure to check out the blog's RSS feed, at  urlLink http://adamsolomon.blogspot.com/atom.xml . It's linked on the side, I believe. If not, it will be soon. And if you don't have an RSS reader, what are you waiting for? Download one! Just Google "RSS Reader". There are some good free ones out there...
