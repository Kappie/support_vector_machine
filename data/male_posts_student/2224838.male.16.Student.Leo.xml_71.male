It was a horrible sight. The next band, The Green Fuse, was...different, to say the least. Kelpie brought in a soothing vibe, with a sort of soft rock sound like the Strokes. Then, unextpectedly, Ricky Fitts and The Great Redneck Hope set up directly across from each other and held a sort of duel, with everyone in the place completely encircling them. I can't exactly say who won, but let me just tell you that the whole thing involved partial-nudity, indie rock, grind-core, sweat, moshing, and a few technical difficulties.     I finally made it to church this morning after about a month of absence. The service that I go to with my family is called  urlLink Breakthru , which is basically a later service with a more casual atmosphere. Although I didn't really get into the praise music as far as singing goes, hearing it made me realize that I need to start playing my guitar again. Then I could jam with my brother, on bass, for the first time. My brother gives me crap for letting my guitar sit idly by, collecting dust. He's right to give me crap though... Music can be an awesome thing for me, if I would just devote a little time to it.
