I know this sounds sorta pathetic that I'm writing about two girls that I like, but think of it this way: what would you do? K and T. I like K, she has been dormant for a while and I think she likes me, that's what her friends tell me. She is incredible. we are alike in a strange way. But T likes me A LOT. i dont know what to do. girls like me....girls dont like me, why dont they make up their mind.
