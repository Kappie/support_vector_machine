       
      Setup and Ran lights for the first time for what had been called by some "big church", in other words, the regular weekend services (when TheWell was still around).  The setup seemed a lot better or more organized, or maybe there were just more people there to help... but after the setup, I felt very helpless and very nervous.  I feel like it was the worst job I've ever done running a light board, and yet, I still got compliments... I don't know what I was doing.  I wasn't even this nervous when I ran lights the first time for TheWell.  I guess for TheWell, I had a lot more free reign.  There are more constraints on what you can, can't, should, and shouldn't do for the regular services... maybe that got me all flustered, who knows.  Hopefully tomorrow morning will go better.  Please, God.
