Admittedly the athletes will probably do so (if not there is obviously something wrong with them) but to have a song celebrating this?  Er...ok.      The variations in costume were quite startling - the beautiful national costumes of some countries contrasting with the air host/ess outfits of other countries..and the not quite so attractive tracksuits of several others.         I'd not really thought about the amount of people in the Olympic teams - but the three contestants in the Lichtenstein team looked slightly outnumbered compared to the hordes of the New Zealand team.  Hopefully they won't be outclassed.      Watching the Olympics makes me remember quite how useless  am at games.  I am prepared to admire the feats of others, as long as nobody expects me to be able to do any of it myself :)
