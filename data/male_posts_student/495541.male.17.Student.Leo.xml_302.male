It's great to have this dumb thing to remind me of the stupid stuff I've done.  It's an easy way to recount all the dumb things I've done.  I guess it helps me progress.  Last weekend we went up to Cedar Falls for the UNI tournament thing.  We didn't do so hot.  We went 1-5, I believe.  I don't remember the games well, I never do.  I played alright in a few of them.  Had some good plays.  Messed up a couple times.  Probably more than I can remember.  Wend lifting this morning.  Nothing to do now.  That's my story.  You can read last year this time, I was saying the same thing.  Nothing to do now.
