At least its a poem about my Grandpa and it includes stuff about war, so its not like flowery poetry.   I was also plesently shocked that I have only 3 weeks to complete my Honors Thesis and as of now I have 0 pages out of a minimum of 25 done.  But I've got 14 pages of rough draft material that may or maynot be used.  If it is used, I'm in a lot better shape because another 10 pages would be cake to spit out.
