Talked to Shameela today too - seems we're meeting up tomorrow to go to Adventure Island - probably the worst place to go this year cause of the heat...i hope it rains. shes also trying to encourage me to come to aber-bloody-ryswth or however you spell it...really not that keen on going so far away.  Disney land is looking good - meeting gem and charli on tuesday to discus the actual trip. managed to get a good deal for Â£355 stayin at the New York hotel, including travel and park fees. all we need to buy is lunch, dinner and toys :D
