Hmm, my thought for the day--can cats have separation anxiety like children do?  I think Kezia is going through that...I came back from VA in May to an angry cat (Lucky showed her emotions--she missed me and was affectionate).  But as for Kezia..she was mad at me for a couple of days...then I had to leave AGAIN for Albany to see Andrew's college graduation (that's my brother, mind you).  I stayed with the parents for 10 days, and came back to...you guessed it, an angry cat.  Then, she became her usual affectionate self and wouldn't leave me alone.  I definitely do not mind my baby crawling all over me...I yearn for that, and I love our times together.  NOW, she's starting the separation anxiety thingy...every time I walk out of the door to go out to work, school, errands--who follows me?  My lovely cat...meowing the whole way to the outside door and looking back at me like, "Mama, I wanna go with you."  That's strange cuz she hates car rides, hmm.  I gotta show her extra attention--but woe me and woe Kezia..I'm going home this weekend for my Daddy's day and my mom's birthday.  Poor Kezia.   Other than Kez...Lucky's doing quite well, and she finally is showing me her nice side, coming up to me to be petted, sleeping next to me (literally), and just being a nice cat.  I guess she ages well. :-)  Caleria and Hoberta--bless their souls.  They are 6 years old now, and ferrets only live up til 7-9 years...I am going to miss them dearly when they leave us.  We let them out of their cage more often now, and watch them play until they fall asleep next to each other as usual.  They ARE good animals...yes, yes, I was terrified by them for a long time when Eric and I started dating, but I became attached to them, despite the feet biting fetish they have.  I come home and look at them in their cage, sleeping peacefully...and my heart just melts.  I do cherish my time with them.    Hmm, other than our pets...I was reading the comments my friends left me.  Rachel--I can't bear to stay for one extra quarter like you suggested...if I do that, I won't be able to start a teaching job til the following year, yuck!  I am going to graduate in May of 2005--pack up the apartment and our pets--move wherever I get a job--and start our lives there, and planning the wedding!  That's my general goal, and I plan to stick with it!  About those dreadful English courses and evil Mr. Bateman, I'll just figure it out as I go along.  Right now, I'm leaning toward to dropping History of Theater this Fall, and just stick with the regular MSSE 16 credits along with assistantship (that reminds me, I gotta find one), and studying for certification exams.    That's all for now...I'm sure that I'll have plenty of time on my hands when I'm in Albany this weekend--perhaps I can post more blogs for my dear readers?  Ta-ta for now, Brooke
