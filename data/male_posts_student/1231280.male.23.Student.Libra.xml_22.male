First, the good things: As I waiting for the bus this morning, Candice (the girl who I have wanted for a while now) stops, rolls down her window and asks if I want a ride. What do you think I did? We get to class and I guess she was bragging to 'Los that she gave me a ride....could this be a sign of things to come? Stay Tuned. Anyways, got some more work done on my project and Ted Fred said that I'm on the right track...which is good. So, during class, I ask Candice if she wants to grab a beverage after class....she agrees. We go, chill out for a little bit and I get a ride home in the process. Turns out I can see her apartment form my bedroom window. NICE! She goes to work and I chill on the ole couch for awhile. Now here I am completely procrastinating on my paper that I need to write. So, pretty good day overall. Totally funny scandalous things are going on with the hoobaskank next door that I won't post here for obvious reasons. If you know my number and want to know...gimmie a call - I'll tell ya! Anyways, out for now.  -B
