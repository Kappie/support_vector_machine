But the teens are worse cause they at least think they are cool.  Anyways, I never get fun email anymore.  I look forward to opening my inbox, and for my one account, I get billions of spams for porn, and on the other, I get my Borders newsletter.  Kinda lame if you ask me... Oh well, this really isnt a complaint, its just more of an observance.  Got paid.  Gonna go throw it in the bank.  Later.
