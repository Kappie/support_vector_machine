I guess we don't have to wait for a new disease for pigs, turns out, they've got bird flu, too!   reposted from CTV.ca    Concerns about a mutated form of a bird flu arising in pigs have long troubled medical experts, who are worried that it could be the next step in a human-to-human mutation.   Pigs are unique in that they can be infected by both human and avian influenza viruses. That makes them an ideal vessel for bird and human viruses to mix and mutate into powerful and dangerous new strains.   Epidemiologists warn that keeping animals in close contact on farms promotes opportunities for cross-infection. The markets of Southeast Asia, with birds, pigs and humans in close contact, are prime breeding grounds for such events.   The flu pandemic of 1918 was due to a virus that was avian in origin, but also had strong similarities to pig flu viruses. A completely new virus emerged and spread around the globe in around six months, killing as many as 40 million people worldwide.     While we're talking about diet, according to the current fad diet, which declares war on carbohydrates, we're all supposed to stay away from high-carb foods, such as bread and orange juice  So. For breakfast, I guess we can't eat bacon and eggs, nor can we eat toast or orange juice. If you ask me, bacon, eggs, toast and orange juice is one of the best breakfasts a person can eat. Ah well, I guess I'll just have to sacrifice those foods (which have been around for centuries with little evidence of them causing heart disease or obesity throughout history), in favour of safer, healthier foods such as Corn Pops and dark colas. I know that if it's made by humans in a factory, it's got to be far safer than all this disease infested stuff nature can throw at us!  I'm going to start a diet, called the "LOW PARANOIA DIET".
