The manner in which the four governers have been shown the door smacks of any decency that this government can claim to have. The major votaries of democracy and probity in polity (Communists n who else) is still not out of their long slumber.They would not mutter a word coz it was "De-Saffornising". I also dont understand the logic behind assuming the colour of safforn with fundamentalism.The colour of safforn is in the Indian Flag and the manner in which that has been humiliated by these self proclaimed saviours of nation has only added to my alienation from them. Iam witness to the numerous "Ramzon fast" session of various hues of politicians but is yet to come across a single politicians(Other than Ofcourse BJP n its more idealogically close allies) who had enough courage to sit in a "Vinayaghar Shathurthi" festival. These  urlLink "I-Wear-My-Secularism-In-Sleeves"  type of politicians make me sick.
