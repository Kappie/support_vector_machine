My mom was watching a movie with a guy.  I felt very awkward, cause this hasnt happened yet, I guess I knew it would happen...I just didnt expect it.  He is the guy that put in our dishwasher, I thought he was married...maybe he is, maybe he really is just a "friend".  I went back in the car and my dad asked who was over, and I said a guy.  And I could tell that wasnt good to him.  I said he probably was married and he put in our dishwasher.  My dad cried quietly, I tried to make him feel better, and asked him for a hug, and he gave me one later.  I still feel like an asshole, maybe I should have lied and said it was just another one of her girlfriends.  I hate it when my dad cries, cause you always see your dad as strong, and I never really seen him cry until the divorce.  I would be really ripped apart if i were him...I mean, your ex-wife, you once loved with another guy...doing god knows what.  I hope my dad is ok.  This is all too new, and I feel awkward.
