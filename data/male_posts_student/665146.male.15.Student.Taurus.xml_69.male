Before I say any more about this, let's just look at the irony of how I'm  now  writing in my blog: 1. Most of the entries in my portfolio were blog entries, which probably sabotaged my chances of getting in.  2. I chose to write in my weblog after having the feeling of rejection that brings the words, "I'll never write again in my life, ever, as long as I live."  So, as I can't help but laugh at the irony itself, there's just this pitted feeling.  Of course, you didn't come here to listen to me bitch, you came for humor and cynicism... Let me just say that they REALLY should specifically tell me what was wrong with my audition and portfolio so I could have a better chance for when the next audition comes around, otherwise I could end up exacerbating what was wrong with my portfolio and repeating this process.  Now you see how coming here to listen to me bitch is starting to make sense, eh?  But like I said, it feels weird, kind of like this:    ...mixed with...    ...sprinkle in a little:   ...about 2 lbs of...    ...and blend well to get...    But not nearly as pretty as all of that...
