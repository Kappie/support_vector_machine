ONE out of eight. this is california, isn't it? hot as hell, waited for about five years outside, got to hang out with hella people, adam kept on trying to beg people to play cards and eventually we played mafia which was fun although i still don't get it. adam offered parisa some sprite in a sobe bottle and parisa was like, is that pee? then she and sumit started talking about the color of their pee. you know you're in a good relationship when you can openly talk about bodily functions. yeup. me and adam whaled away at elyse with air-kicks while she complained about freshmen that don't cooperate. don't they all.   joanna tried to get out of carrying desks just cuz she's a precious little soph, but we know their kind better than that. liss gave me a snickers ice cream bar (YOU RULE!) and let me try her lip thingy that looks like a highlighter...hahahah it smelled good...just glad nobody noticed. amanda took BAD care of my precious cards...they got on top of a soda machine...it's ok though, she whupped us good in hearts even though she and selena kept LEAVING. some hearts partners they are. i got locker 170, not too bad, mei got this one locker that had a bazillion pieces of gum wedged on the door. nasty. it took like 10 minutes with my key to get rid of it...mei was the 100th person to say i look like a girl in the vortex pic. why me??? then me, eugene and alex went out to leave, we talked about how briefs are more comfortable than speedoes and varsity bath towels and yea. apparently gayzel passed by and saw us...coool, then we went home. then i slept.   PENNY HARDAWAY IN THAT ONE BASKETBALL MOVIE WITH NICK NOLTE!!! AHHH!!!!
