I, for one, am glad that he is back (I almost typed the word 'black') and ready to write! Let's hear about something controversial JR!  At any rate, even though it may be denied, a lot has happened over the last three days. For myself, I definitely have had a lot of things happening.... You can check my blog to get an idea, but not the full picture if you wish.  Until JR blogs, Stay TUNED!!
