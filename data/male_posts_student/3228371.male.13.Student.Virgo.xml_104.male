It was cool. Got hyper the whole night. Sonia and I layed down on the stage and just talked. Finally remembered Karen Lau's name. Haha! She was "POP CAN GIRL" 'cos she had the pop can stuff on her earrings. Very cool person. I think she's a really good friend of Amy's. They're always together. Obvious. Anyway... Had a really good water fight after that. Got myself all wet 'cos of SALLY mostly, got my tank top a little wet, not too wet that there was any exposure and I guess that was it. I'm considered lucky. Other people got a lot more wet! Like Gordon and Wilfred! Muahahahaha! Got Gordon all wet and Wil too! Actually I put my 3 cups of water down Gordon's back and then some in Wil's face! ROOFLES! Hilarious.  School today was okay. (why do I always go backwards on my day?) Might go to Nima's tomorrow. Not 100% sure yet but yeah. I'm really tired. Didn't get too much sleep last night. Probably won't this night either. Whatever. Got a new ring (yay!), a watch, earrings, hair accessories, and a phone string thing. :) It's a couple thing. A girl and a boy one. So I'll keep the girl one and I'm gonna give Nima the guy one. It's a super-casual grad gift. So yeah. I was gonna get us a couple ring instead but I don't think Nima would like a ring. Besides, it's not really a "girlfriend" thing to get the guy a ring anyway. Haha!   Well, I should go now... I might blog tomorrow. I don't know. Whatever. I'll try to get some shut eye tonight. I'm off. Peace.  P.S. Took piccy with sis. It was okay. I guess my sis isn't as bad sometimes when she's in a good mood. ;)
