Sarah refused to drink the lemonade and received the cat o'nine tails for her mistake.  In defense she hit Joe with a golf club, creating a serious bump on his forehead.  During a highly competitive game of golf in which I vanquished all who opposed me, The Almighty and Merciful Lord rained down flood waters upon us to prevent a total washout on the scoresheet.  Then enlighted by the heavens to show compassion upon my competitors, I treated everyone to beverages and vittles at a local pub, completely on me.  Salsa was involved.  So was Mango.  Dave, speaking for the rest of the group, thanked me from the bottom of his heart for the times of their lives.  So endith the evening.  And remember, if you reneg on something, you're a renegger.  I'm Audi 5000.
