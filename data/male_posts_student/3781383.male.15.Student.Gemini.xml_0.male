I will be driving most of the way and the drive can take anywhere from eight and a half to 11 hours.  I will be able to drive all the time up there because I am the only one underage besides my sister and she is staying down here to work.  She is so poor she even owes me money.  The sad thing is, I can't even pay attention.  Today all I get to do is pack and maybe put away groceries if I'm lucky.  I am going to RC sports to buy a new stringing kit for my stick because I need something to do for three weeks, and is going to take a full day for me to string it.  I have been listening to a lot of music I usually would make fun of.  I kinda like country now.  My favorite country song is "Cause the Chicks Dig it".  I also like "Hell Ya", "Redneck Woman", "Beer for my Horses", and "If you Ever Stop Loving me".  I've had nothing else to do all summer except junior golf.  I am fifteen and I have to golf with, like, 12-year-olds.  At least I get to hang out with one of my best friends, Jake.  Jake is probably the only friend I have who my parents or my sister doesn't make fun of or say they are a bad influance.  He is also the only friend I have that is almost exactly like me.  We both play sports.  We are golf buddies and I got him to try lacrosse and he got me to try hockey.  They are very similar.  We also both have older sisters who we dispize.  Our sisters are also kinda friends.  My sis is a church lady and so is his.  That is why my sis thinks Jake is "good people".  I have a couple of friends who are really nice to me and some who i could do without.  I have one friend who is a real hard ass.  His name is Ben and he can be an on and off friend.  When we are one on one or with some of my other close friends we are really tight.  Any other time...he gets pissy.  My old best friend, Eric, was one of the nicest people I know.  Keyword...WAS.  He started hanging out with some real tards.  This one kid Tony really gives me a hard time.  Eric and I started hanging out less, then we stopped talking on the phone, then he changed his AIM name and never told me.  Now we have verbal battles in the middle of classes.  I still try to talk to the old Eric every once in a while, but he is almost gone.  That is about it for today's sob story.  I tried to give you enough to last for three weeks, but I'm not sure.  Maybe next time I'll talk about my friends who are girls...not girlfriends (I'm a loser).  Now the Rachels and Christene won't feel left out.  I can't forget Kelley either.
