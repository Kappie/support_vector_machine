It comes down to a fucking phone call, one god damned call. Who knew one call could ruin so much? I know I didn't. The person who called me knows who they are, and I will say it as simply as this, fuck you and get the hell out of my life. I know it seems rude, but, still get the fuck out of my life. I will say this to a certain person, not the one that called me. It seems that you can do as you want to, so I'm going to start doing as I want. Pain, pain, pain. Pain is a fucked up feeling for me. I am in a lot of pain, but hell, I don't care anymore, I've gotten used to it. Now I'm having a fit of laughter because it was so obvious. It would be so easy to blame others for my problems right now, but I think apart of getting older is realizing your mistakes, and I am standing up and taking the blame fully for how I feel. Bobbie and I could get back together, but I doubt that is going to happen. This was meant to be a serious post, but I can't find the words I want to use, so fuck it, now I'm just going to joke around.    Myk, you type way to much man. Geez, if I could type that much I'd have books out. Zaph, well, Zaph and I have difenately lost connection somewhere.  Damn, back to the seriousness of things, I think I might have to go see my old therapist if I keep these feelings up. God damn, I keep typing for no reason, so I'm going to end this post, more than likely you will have a very longer post tomorrow.
