This hot-shot was caught closing up to emma watson at KFC bugis over a tray of Singapura Satay Burger. (Budget kaper?)    2nd is Adzmin otherwise known as A-che-min. This manjakid may be no playboy but he seems pretty busy with his handphone nowadays. He was caught red-handed in front of the freshies as he had to answer a call in the middle of a training match. ( tak leh tunggu kaper? )  Excerpts from the call:    ****: ermm,bz ke cayang?    Adzmin: Alah,tgh game nie. Nanti mlm kita bebual agi k? ******!    (Some of the words are censored to protect the identity of the gal as well as the intensity of the conversation.)    3rd is Rizal otherwise known as Gay-Bob. This guy with the seemingly fierce and smart outlook could fool anyone dat he's some businessman. However, this guy seems to have some hidden identity. Caught french kissing with a freshie,Shamil, and sometyms to Adzmin. Not once though. (desperate kaper? )    4th is Farok known as Rokok-boi. This playboy seems to have nuting else to do other than snuggling up to gals or going up to any pretty gal and ask for number. Known for changing galz lyk using toilet paper. Last seen at hotel 81 with a gal at Geylang...(ish3,buat maksiat kaper?)    5th is Akil a.k.a kewl kid. This guy under his kewl and quiet demeanour is one dangerous maniac. Caught harassing "7 stars" online as well as disturbing SP fans. (lu gila kaper?)    6th is Farhan. Quiet and relatively unknown. Caught at R.O.M with a lady nicknamed Trotters. If there is any info abt her and farhan,plz inform me at the tagboard. (Lu tak sabar moh kahwin siang2 kaper? ) Thank you.    Last but not least is Afsal. This big bad beetleborg opz, i mean big friendly giant isnt ur normal average defender. He does his job well on court but off-court he's pretty high on "tanni". Was charged in court many times for drink-driving. Recently, seen going "home" early from trainings with a social escort.  The gal is pretty hot though...;)    hmmm...Are these floorballers damn hot or wad? Can't wait to get your hands on them? Get to know them well when u come down to our trainings on weekends on sat 9-12pm or on sundays 2-6pm. While stocks last.     More updates will be available soon....
