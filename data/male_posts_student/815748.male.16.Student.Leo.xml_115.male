Even English; I understand why Stephanie likes it now.  When I went to the Mock Trials meeting last night, Elliott was like, "Since you left, we haven't lost a match.  Think that means anything?"  I kind of lost my energy for Mock Trials, but it's fun nonetheless.  I blew this thing today that I might talk about if you ask me, and then there are a couple of other issues that I can't talk about to anyone, 'cept maybe one person.  I'm really getting back into the hang of classes, and I've actually been handling my work better than before, even though the new work ethic I got from France was "do it if you feel like it."  All in all, Jewton life has been fairly good.  Oh, and I finished my movie, talk to me about figuring something out whereby people can watch it.  "It's called an unnatural death because the person doesn't... die naturally." ---Ms. Kranes
