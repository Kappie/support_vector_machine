I haven't slept properly from earlier than 11 at night until past half 8 in the morning for longer than I can remember, and things gradually seem to be taking me down with it. Bad news, motivation and concentration all seem to have suffered somewhat, to which I am seriously considering going to the doctor about. I doubt it is total insomnia, just maybe a partial nocturnal situation, a fear of the night per say.  So I won't drag this out upon you poor souls any longer, I just thought I might address this situation to what I feel is the truest thing in my life at the moment - this blog. I don't think it's all that sad to be honest, my ego needs a good kick up the posterior to get it going. xBuBzx
