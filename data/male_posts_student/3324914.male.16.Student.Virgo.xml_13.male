I am extremely eccentric, so I will probably rant on about random things such as aliens, government, music, movies and whatever else catches my fancy.  Actually, I like to stress my eccentricitys to people. I find that if they can take me, I can enjoy the company a whole lot better.  I just moved to the center of Canada, the city of Brandon. Its pretty nice. Its no Vancover, but it will do. I used to live in the country, so its been a great change, now I have more things to do. I'm going to enjoy going to the mall and the Sportsplex. Maybe I'll even get some paintballing in there.  As I'm writing this I'm listening to "Janes Addiction" (Three days  Just Because). Of course in acouple of minutes I'll be listening to some oldschool rock (Boston), and alittle bit more newschool (LifeHouse, Matthew Good).   I love music. I couldn't do without my music. Frankly, its what my entire life is based around. That and movies. I enjoy a good movie. I find that it is a great boost for the imagination.  Oh! Lifehouse's "Take Me Away" just started to play. I love that song. I think it is one of my favorite songs ever. It has the best sound I've ever heard. I could sing alot with it for hours. Seriously!  Oh! Matthew Good's "Weapon" just started to play.  Well, I think thats it for the day.  Thanks for checking in.
