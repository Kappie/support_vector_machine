I've been accepted to the ISU Graduate school program.  I was already accepted to the Human Computer Interaction degree program.  I have my access number to register for classes, and they have a desk reserved.  I'm going to get my master's degree!  The more I think about it, the more excited and scared I feel at the same time.  I might talk a bit more about my research and project work later on.  But for now, back to the grinding stone.
