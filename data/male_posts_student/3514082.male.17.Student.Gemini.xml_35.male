I had Lee round on monday and tuesday (he stayed the night and we were up till 0400, watching movies), and we have pumped out a script for our summer film "Disconnected", we have found the location, sign nearly all the actors, even invented a new type of camera techniqe (BikÃ©Cam). So the film is on schedule for after I get back from holiday and he does. Then Simon came over on the tuesday afternoon and after a trip to John's Water with chris he stayed the night. On wednesday had to do chors for mum, but in the evening we went to the worst organised cinema trip ever, (I think Laura W organised it, it oculd only have been a girl) we went to Cromer to go and see a film (Shrek 2 - zzzzzzz) in the crappest cinema and then everyone went off in different directions and we ended up having crap fish and chips in the fish shop because the rain was so bad, and of course there were no buses to go home on because Laura didnt think of that when she decided to go to a crap cinema in a shitty place to see an unfunny film.  Anyway I know you won't be reading this Ryck as you are on tour at the moment. On the way back form visiting the Kent university open day (fantastic I want to go there) we stopped at a welcome break service station where mum spoke to your family and they said they were on their way to see you perform. So good luck with it, you probably wont see this till after you've finished but my sentiment is with you. Break a neck... er leg!   Busy week ahead: Sunday, Tom and I are going to see Bi Jovi the Bon Jovi tribute band at the waterfront, Monday meeting Simon, Ben and Tom to change crappy pounds to EUROS and decide on routes and weather or not to pop over to Brussels etc, Tuesday take Jez on the Boat durring the day, Wednesday pack for Paris and Greece then go to Luton Airport and kip the night in the terminal (not as bad as it sounds i've done it before), then Thursday arrive a la Paris and sleep the night in a auberge du juennese (youth hostel), then Friday in Paris/possibly a while in Brussles and catch the 22:30 flight home (local time, arrive back in stinkville 22:45) then a three day break then Greece.  Anyways hope you sparkely new Gmail account is treating you well. Mine is. I shall send you one of the production shots for Disconnected. I shall also go to bed as I am tired after being in Canterbury all day.  Good Day!, Alexanderos> P.S. I may be spending a year in Italy as part of my course at uni, how cool! Alex
