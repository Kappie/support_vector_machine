If you have commented and I haven't responded I'm sorry, but now I've set it to where Blogger will e-mail me whenever I get one.   That should clear some stuff up for those of you who might have or will. Sorry about that. I'll go back through in a few minutes and see if there's any more I've forgotten. =-$    Edit:  I went through and didn't find many comments. Not sure if that's good or bad. =-PTo "Mac", thanks for commenting on June the 1st(I think). To my lovely (or not so lovely =-P) Anonymous friend(s), glad you commented too. Glad I caught you when I could. Well, that's about it. Thanks for stopping bye.  July 23, 2004 at 3:37 PM
