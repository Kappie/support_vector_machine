For days before the field trip, people have been saying that we may have to take school buses up to Hershey. It was one of those things that you say better not happen, but they always do. So yeah we took school buses up. And of course we got a pretty nasty bus driver. But don't we always. When we got to the park we said that we shouldn't split up like last year. But as time went on, we split up, so that was useless. First ride was The Great Bear if i recall correctly. Oh yes. I felt special since we were the first in line. But we had to wait like 10 minutes before they tested the rides a million times. (Which didn't help some rides..I will explain later) It was cool though none the less. After the Great Bear, our group (which ended up being Me, Murph, Nick, Dominic, Caroline basically) headed over to the new ride, the Storm Runner or whatever. It looked awesome, and turned out being even better. The ride is cool since it shoots you up this vertical opposite loop kinda thing really fast. But yeah. Next was the Sidewinder which turned out being the best part of the day. Not because of the ride however. Me, Nick, Justin, and Bethany were in line looking for good looking women when we saw one of the hottest girls we've ever seen. I mean amazing. I couldn'believe my eyes. So basically the rest of the day we were looking for her. After this, we met up with Jimmy and them and then went to the Lightning Racers. We may have gotten a little too into it since we made teams and were trash talking the entire time. Turns out we had to wait 10 minutes anyway since they were fixing the other track or somethin like that. We lost anyway. Our trip on the Wildcat was a little strange. All day I was praying that we wouldn't get stuck on a ride since alot of rides have ben stalling and what not. So we're riding the Wildcat and we get to the very top of the first hill and.....it stops. I started freakin out, Kuklis was going to start calling people, Murph was checkin what was going on, and all I hear is Wilson: "Is it just me or does anyone else find this HILARIOUS??" Yeah I was gonna punch him. When it finally started moving again it sounded like it came off the track. Not good. But anyway, after that we just walked around. Watching Nick walk up to random girls asking them to pet his pink dolphin. Funny stuff. So yeah yesterday was pretty cool indeed. Fun times. Let's hope this last week of school goes quickly. I hate exams...
