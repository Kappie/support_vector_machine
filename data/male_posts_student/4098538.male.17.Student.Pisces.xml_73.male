I'm gonna apologise now for any poor grammer on here, but I'm on my dads computer and his keyboard is funny, and I'm also still feeling slightly odd. I downloaded a really cool program that you type into, and then the computer says what you typed! But you get tons of voices like robots and hyper women, and you also get Spanish. Went for a meal on Saturday and it truly was king sized. I had me some nice baby-back ribs. Huge! And chips and salad. And a massive desert, consisting of ice cream, caramel, strawberries, cream and marshmallows. Quite nice but sickening at the same time. I went to Mandy's today too. It was nice, as usual. I like spending time with her. EDIT - PS. It's kind of ironic that I apologise for any grammar mistakes, and the only mistake I make in the whole thing is the mispelling of 'grammar'!
