Not exactly sure what I'm going to do with that....  Anyways, now that I have a store creit of 102 dollars at Best Buy....uh I have no clue what I'm doing.  Overall Xmas was cool until everything I got like...fell apart.  My scooter was pre-assembled by retards and does not work.  Good luck trying to send that POS back....both video cards have just not liked my now-broken computer, and I'm back to my laptop!  Thought thats not going to stop me from passing out underneath my couch at New Years.....And with the arrival of New Years means the leaving of stupid guests at parks such as Knotts.  Thank freakin god.
