Today I was to meet Erika at the Oaks Movie theater at 11:15.  So I left at about 10:50 and I arrived early, actually.  So she picked me up.  And we chatted about biology and forensics and electron microscopes and whatnot.  That was fun.  She's in interesting person.    I arrived at Matt's house early.  Before everyone else, nearly.  I just kinda stood there while his mother and Erika arranged stuff.  I offered to help but there wasn't anything really for me to help.  I did help bring up some beverages.  I felt like a sore thumb.  Like I didn't really belong.  Which was partly true.  I mean, I don't think I would have been invited if I had not had plans with Matt that needed to be broken.  Sigh.  His friends started arriving.  They were cool people.  There were a couple of silences which I didn't understand.  They must be really good friends, I don't know how there were silences.  There's almost never something like that with my friends.  There's always constant conversations with my friends.  But I guess people are different.  I think the day was fun.  Although it was getting bit old and overdone with meeting new people, these were good people to meet.  I had a great time.  I was kinda sad I didn't get any time alone with Matt but I think it was important for him to spend time with his friends and family.  Since he is going away.  Maybe I'll have time with him later.  I hope so.  I don't want this to be the last time we meet.  I really like him.  I want him to stay here so I can be with him more.  I hate this.  He is such an awesome guy.  I don't want to let go.  Heh, look at me, I have watery eyes.  Sigh.
