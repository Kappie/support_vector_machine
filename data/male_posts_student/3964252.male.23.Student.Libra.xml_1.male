I probably would be in a dead-end relationship with no meaning or feelings. My life has turned around dramatically in just one year. It's almost been one year to the day since I left straightdom, which was only a temporary scenic route to what I really wanted out of life. I couldn't imagine living a lie for much longer than I did. I'm just glad I finally put what other folks think about me in that aspect aside and started going with what my heart felt. I'm not flamboyantby any means (except when I get excited according to Michael :) ...but I am just so damn proud of myself to finally throw out all the reservations I had about myself to become to person I feel most comfortable with. Michael has meant everything to me, and I wouldn't be the person I am today without him...He understands me as I understand him, which is something that no one has ever accomplished in both cases. Ilove him with all of my heart,and I look at our future together with great anticipation....He might say something to me about being so open on this post, but that's ok...I want him and whoever else cares to know how I feel about him...He is my special boy... ;)
