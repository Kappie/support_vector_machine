I thought this book was very depressing, which, I'm sure, is a shared opinion between those of us who have read it.  Holden, the main character, scared me quite a bit.  Throughout his decline, I began to notice quite a lot of similarities between he and I; this is scary because Holden loses control of his life.  I'm curious to find what other people's opinions are of this book, and if they felt any connection with Holden.
