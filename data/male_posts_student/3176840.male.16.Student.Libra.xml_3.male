If it is really over I should forget about you  But I will still be waiting for you here   * Chorus (Repeat)   Rap)  In my heart I hear your breath for a bit  It fills the empty spot which you left  Why did you leave so suddenly?  Sometimes that fills my thoughts  I don't hate you, rather I love you  My future is tied up in yours  I'm sure you'll come back  I know I'm a fool for feeling this way, but that's the way my heart is  I'm sincere about the way that I feel  White clouds will cover the sky  If I can just convey to you that I will always be waiting for you  This waiting is so tough  But no matter how tired I may be  My love for you will never end  Forever, until the next world...   * Chorus (Repeat)
