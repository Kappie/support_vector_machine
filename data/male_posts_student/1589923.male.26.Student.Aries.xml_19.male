Sometimes i wonder what it is like to be to attracted to someone else... i have been in this relationship for almost a year.....and i can't really remember what was it like to be attracted to someone... the feelings, the emotions of missing someone deeply, the thought of looking forward to that person each and every day. oh well, that's what being in a relationship is all about... being committed to the very person whom brings out all these feelings in the beginning. It's strange... i have yet seen anyone in school that caught my fancy. or maybe the fact i'm too oblivious to my surroundings could be one of the reasons too. So far, in this relationship, my eyes have yet wander around... and i thought if i do it, my partner will do it too, somewhat along the line of, "do what unto others do unto you". but it doesn't apply in my relationship here. It is pretty obvious what sort of nature she is. And that puts her in a more 'vunerable' position to stray than me. It seems like it the equation doesn't balance anymore if i am going by the rules.   It is obvious that anyone can see an instant connection between the 2 of them. I mean.. i'm not blind eh neither am i made of glass. This feeling sucks becoz there's nothing you can do and i do not want to ruin this friendship and relationship. I am the pivot that's supporting the 2. It is that fragile alrite. It's like... i dun want to make a huge fuss out of it yet i know there's something more to just simple flirting and all... i mean, it has come to an extent that whenever i know that my fren's around... i dun feel like seeing him anymore. It's like his presence puts me off now. it's worse if i see her alone with him, like the nite at the dinner... i can't help wondering what was going between them. Kinda shitty eh. Yeah, i know it's sooooo typical pyschotic boyfren behaviour rite? but i SERIOUSLY hate this sort of feelings. In fact, i DESPISE it!! Given a choice, i rather not be like this. It's not by choice i am feeling this way. circumstances force me to. Things have become to such extent it made me very conscious of their every movement, every behaviour. Even tho she assured me there's nothing go on between her and him, i mean, who can denied the fact they have already crossed the boundaries of a relationships. how can u expect me to simply believe when every time i see things and actions that totally contradict your words? tell me?? I dun see myself as being possesive eh. I have given her all the freedom and space she wants. Just give me the respect i deserve. I am not sure how long can i go on feeling like this. It seriously sucks alrite.   Her outburst few days back... which says how short her temper is... made me think deeper about myself. I didn't screamed back at her becoz i was shocked and totally unexpected. I mean i was asking her some minor questions and yet it was enough to raise her volatile temper sky high. I really didn't see that coming alrite. sigh. Well, i guess she was frustrated with my lack of understanding of the issue and all i did was asking questions after another.... and that pissed her off eh.   We had really wonderful time together prior to that outburst... We spent quality time doing stuff together and chatting with one another...it's almost like being in love once again... the physical touch, the words... we were totally in our own world... pity...all good things must come to an end eh.. how dissappointing.   Maybe it's better to let things take its course... i have too much things in mind, school's started, my assignment, my exams...I am trying extremely hard not to let it distract me. Maybe it's better to live and let live.   I wonder if i will die young....
