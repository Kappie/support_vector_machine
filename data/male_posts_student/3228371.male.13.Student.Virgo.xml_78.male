I had his phone number and I still have it but yeah... Never called him though. Guess how I found Bruce again? FRIENDSTER! I knowww~ Coincidential! I browsed through DesmonD's friends and found... BRUCE! I saw his name and wondered if it was the Bruce I used to know and judging by the pics on the profile, it was! So I added him on MSN and we talked a bit. He remembered me! Yay! I'm glad we got back in touch tonight! He's a really good friend and stuff! Ooh got some pics of Gummi from Friendster. Oh there's this really cool one! I don't know how they do it. It's so cool though! Ask me to show you! It's total coolness! Anyway... I gotta go for now... I miss Nima... Called his place but his dad said he wasn't home. Oh well... I hope I'll get to see him tomorrow or I hope he calls 'cos I miss him.
