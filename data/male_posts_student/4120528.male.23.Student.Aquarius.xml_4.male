So for the last few days I have been in a wierd type of la la land mood.  I dont know how I really feel.  I have been out and about with a the few friends that I have.  I went out that night and played the best pool of my life.  After that I quit for the night.       The next day I was like a zombie.  I didnt know what I was doing I think I was just going through the motions.  This was sunday.  I got home and took a nap mostly because sleep is not coming easy nor has it ever.  After that I just stayed home.  Feeling numb.        Today was wierd I woke up not feeling like I slept a wink.  So I got up and tryed to check my email but my comp wont let me conect to the internet.  I get im but that is all.  So then I go and pack my stuff to come home.  I get in my car and go to cal. to deposit a check and see if misty is around.  Thank god she was.  If I didnt see her I would probably have gone nuts.       Misty is a whole nother story.  I can't start to say how much she has helped me these last few weeks.  There are other things but not for this posting.      So here I am at home with nothing going on but my mind at full throttle.  So I am typing things out to try and say something I dont know what but something.
