Oh, I forgot Friday. On Friday, I went to Acoustic cafe and it was good except the gay guy saying his poem about having gay sex, which should not be allowed god damnit. He's grossing people out first of all, second of all looking at him makes me want to kill him, third of all gays shouldn't announce their gayness to the world because it's just gross, and fourth of all it's called "Acoustic Cafe" for a reason. Not "Gay People Poet Lounge." Wow, Sunday...I saw my cousins perform their annual St. Pat's Christmas Show. This year is Kate's last year because she's a senior, we'll miss your great jokes on stage Kate, especially the Shrek, Superstar and History of The World jokes influenced by me and my mom. Today, I, what did I do. Nothing. I had barely any homework. I just sat around like a lazy bum, ate, talked online (that's a first) and watched The Time Machine. I think I'm going to have to watch it a few times before I completely understand it. I have to write an essay for English on it as I explained on Thursday. 10 Days Left. I'm so excited, it hurts. I can't stand waiting any longer. I just want the vacation...I can picture it right now, 2 weeks of friends, cousins, jamming with bands (and my cousin on Christmas Eve), watching adults drunk and they end up provoking me to drink because they're so drunk they probably think I'm Martha Stewart, video games, toys, movies, lots of food, great fun, games, the Cop party on Friday where I shall play for all the cops my dearest drumming, CHRISTMAS, seeing everyone I wasn't able to see during this busy year. Oh it's going to be awesome!!! Tomorrow night I have my band concert. We're gonna kick some can, Jupiter sounds awesome. As you can see I'm in a pretty good mood and will be for the next couple of months. This is the best time of the year. Ok bye!
