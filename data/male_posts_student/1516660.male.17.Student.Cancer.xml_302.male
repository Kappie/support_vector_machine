It was a great show (although I fell asleep at some point of time for a short while). They said Beyonce won 5 awards (YAY!! Way to go, Beyonce!), but I only saw one!! (I only fell alsleep for a very short segment!) How could it be possible?!! Very very strange! Evanescence won New Artistes and another award. YaY!! Even ducks meow at the Grammys! Hmm... I loved Justin's performance (of Senorita) and Beyonce's (performed Dangerously In Love)! Meow meow!!  Hmm... after the Grammys it was almost boring. I went online and played games lor. Oh yes yes. I vomitted out a large piece of cuttlefish. HaHa. I didn't chew it up properly and it got stuck in my oesophagus. I have to vomit it out. Meow moo!! Also, Wendy invited me over to play MahJong! Alas! How I wish I can join her! I can't, due to dinner obligations. Sigh!!  I went to back, ate dinner and came online. HaHa. Ayioh meow!! Okay. I stop here le la. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
