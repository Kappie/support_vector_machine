Erin:  Yeah, sure, why  not.  Jonah: Fear the Orange, Mortals.  And fear the orange mortals.  [After many intense hours translating this with those people who translate at the United Nations, we are ready to declare this a yea.  --Michael]   Marten: Yay!  Michael:  Yay. I'm for the bringing of Tyler if for no other reason than the fact that it will make Nathan shut the hell up about hiring people. Although the blog has been more frequently updated with Paul and Rachel and the new (and Frequent!) postings of Thomas.  Nathan:  Yay.  Paul:   Rachel:   Sophia:  Yeah!  Another person who will cover up the fact that I'm too lazy to post!  Thomas:  This is the way we wash our pants!  Laurence Fishburne:  Yay.  Mr. T:  I pity the foo who won't let Tyler join.  Donald Trump:  He's Fired. The Friday Five will be up again, they just haven't updated for a while on the homepage.  Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.
