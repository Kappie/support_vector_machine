Georgia signifies a strong, sexy side. Times reveals a trustworthy individual. Verdana tips everyone off to your trendiness.  just another good reason to use trebuchet.  again, moving on. or more moving backwards to what i was saying before. i got home, and i decided to blog. however, jthm wasn't next to my bed. it wasn't on my desk. it wasn't even by the computer. i had no idea where johnny was. i'd never lost it before. so i frantically looked everywhere, petrified that my parents had decided to pick it up and flip through. but it was on my book shelf in my room, in the comics section, right between the Dilbert books (like The Dilbert Principle or The Joy of Work) and Dilbert comic books. how did it get there?! i never put johnny on my bookshelves, and if i did, i certainly would not put it in the middle of my dilbert library. it'd go between the calvin and hobbes comics and the zits comics (because johnny has imaginary friends and lots of angst with melodrama). and all my books are perfectly placed within their categories. it's so weird.  well, i had more stuff to say, but boy meets world is on. and i got out some ranting with lauren on the way home. so if you want to hear part of a conversation about what life experience means and the limitations it has and the limitations we put on future experience by experiencing right now, too bad, because i already talked about it tonight. ha ha.  PS-it's louisa's birthday. say happy birthday to her.
