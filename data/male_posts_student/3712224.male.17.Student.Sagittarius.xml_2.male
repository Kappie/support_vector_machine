You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.   Well! Now I remember WHY I never go to public pools!  1. Fact: There's more unrine than chlorine. 2. Fact: There's way too much unidentifiable objects. 3. Fact: There's way too much unidentifiable mucus/goo/bodily fluid. 4. Sunburns 5. Annoying little punk six-year-olds who can school you on the diving board.  And, today I have come to the conclusion that Quintin Tarantino is indeed God.    Le Quote of the Random:  This was freedom.  Losing all hope was freedom.
