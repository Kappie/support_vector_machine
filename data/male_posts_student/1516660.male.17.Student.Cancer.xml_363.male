Well, it started on 1st May..and I was very unlucky enough to get hit on the very day it started. Yeah..basically right, whenever I switched on my computer, 15 minutes later, the virus will strike and command an auto-shutdown of the computer within a minute. This is such a vicious never-ending cycle. Sigh! Anyway, on Sunday, Uncle Steven came and installed XP Pro for me, which is supposedly better la. Yeah. On Monday, Microsoft releashed a patch, which I downloaded and cure the problems. So yay!  Sat what happened? Oh yeah. I went down to play badminton with the cats la. Got lotsa people there. Hmm. That Joyce ar! Go and announce that I like WQ. Ayioh! I said times and times again, it was a joke. Made me so embarassed some more. That WQ exclaimed "KY liked me ar?" Anyway, after that was lunch, which was pretty spicy. HaHa. Okay...after that me, KS, WQ went to Hann's house to watch Miss Congeniality. What a nice show! "If only I have a brain!" HAHAHA! After that, we went to take a NeoCard. What a nice NeoCard! HaHa! I am keeping it in one of my photoframes. HaHa.  Okay. Sunday. Nothing much to report on. My computer was basically much cleaned. Well, the downloaded installations are there, but I have to reinstall the files all over again. Hmm. Will do  that when I am ultra-free. Most prob on a weekend. Yep.  Okay. Monday's PE was surprisingly moderate. I am glad it was not heavy. Yeah. Monday's choir was cancelled due to the absence of Mr Liew, so yay. Oh yes. Remind me to tell Gerald Ng Siva said hi. Yes. When we were walking home, we have very interesting conversations. Now now, I wouldn't reveal what it is. It has been a real eye-opener for some, laughs for everyone. Yeah. That basically sums it up. :)  Today hor...the mass PE was a horror again. Well, I managed to skip doing jumping jacks, which was real crafty of me. Yay to me! Okay. Today was not so bad. We got a Physics lecture test, and I am fairly confident that I can pass. Yeah. What else? I hate Meng Hau. Okay. Check. Oh yes. I completed me homework before coming online. Yay for me as well.   Okay. I am tired le. Yeah. I will end this blog. See ya next time! Night blog!
