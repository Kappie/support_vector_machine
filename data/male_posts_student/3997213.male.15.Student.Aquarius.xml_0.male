Perfect for a toddler in the morning. Yum! It was hot so I came home and went up on the pool deck to read "The Good Earth." That book is so depressing at times so I got my suit on, jumped in the pool, and floated around in a tube...again! Man, I love doing that. It's such a comfortable float. So I pretty much spent the day out back and in my room. It was such a quiet day. Dad was home doing work around the house and Rachel was at cheer camp. Reid was a lazy bum from the sleepover he just had. I was the only energized one in the house for a change. I won't be writing next until Monday. We're leaving for Ocean City, Maryland tomorrow night to visit some cousins and Rachel is spending like two weeks there. We're dropping her off. The house will be so quiet without her and you know what. I think I'm gonna like it.
