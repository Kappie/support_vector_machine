Today was volleyball day... that means all i had to do was set up and take down the net. All the rest was up to the kids. No running, no scrambling, no nothing. We did volleyball for all the groups, and we added a few extra games for the smaller kids. My mom also remembered to bring my drink >.  In the sequence of me driving in the parking lot... i did great today! I actually looked when backing out (last 2 times, i didn't... careless, yeah, a little... but there's nothing behind me anyways) and i didn't brake so hard. I had a good run! Getting a feel for the car now too!  Nene, i'll leave you guys alone now!  Lates
