Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah on Wednesday reached out to Islamic militants operating in the desert kingdom, offering them limited amnesty if they turned themselves in within the next month.  Abdullah said on national television that those who cooperated would not face the death penalty and would be prosecuted only if they had hurt others.  "We are opening the door of amnesty ... to everyone who deviated from the path of right and committed a crime in the name of religion, which is in fact a corruption on earth," he said, reading a statement on behalf of his half-brother, King Fahd.   urlLink FOXNews.com: Saudis Give Terrorists Month to Surrender   via Spot On
