Just that they aren't silly stupid things because I was most definately drunk when I wrote my last entry.  But sometimes you have to love the openness that alcohol brings you.  It can bring out feelings and thoughts you didn't know you had or couldn't put a finger on.  Just another great thing beer can do.
