BAH my work is piling up. piling and piling and piling up. anyway, YES, noone writes in here! writing is therapeutic y'know. i wish o level results were either over and behind me, or would never ever come. hate this nail-biting feeling of anxiousness. phew, never realised that there was so much socialising in rj. it's like i have five socialising days and then saturdays and sundays are the only days i do work at all *sheepish grin* it's supposed to be the other way round right? oops :P do i talk too much? hrm. maybe i do. tomorrow i shall take a vow of silence with the og. need to stop crapping so much all the time yeah? so i will not talk unless someone asks me to talk. good! nite all*~
