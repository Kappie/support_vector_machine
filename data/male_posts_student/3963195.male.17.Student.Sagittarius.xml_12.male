The fear of getting caught by the seniors for ragging was in me…but then due to my luck or some other reasons there was no one near the gates of the college. We went inside and found out our classroom, there was a big rush near the classroom…Parents of the students who are going to join there were waiting anxiously. Soon we got into class and a substitute teacher came in for taking the attendance…when the attendance was nearly over a group of SFI some sort of group or party formed by the students of India came shouting to the class. Everyone including the teachers was a bit shock to see this…but then they just went along with their stuffs and we went along with ours…the class was over within an hour. When we came out of the college, both sides of the national highway roads in front of the college was filled with armed police men’s and armored vans and there were large pieces of stone lying here and there too on the road… some fight with students might have taken place…………seeing that it was not any more safe to stay there we fled from the site…………………….																							The daily classes will be held from tomorrow onwards!!!!!
