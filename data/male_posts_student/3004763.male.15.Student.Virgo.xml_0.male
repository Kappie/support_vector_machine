That sucks hella bad and my favorite teacher Chief aint coming that is the worst. Well tomorrow I find out that I got a D I'm geometry no I don't know yet but I think that I got a D cause that test was supa hard.  I got xbox live last weekend it's one of the greatest things in the world but what I need is but Counter Strike the best online first person shooter till Halo 2 comes out. I must also  say that why does techtv have all the best looking women Morgan Webb, Laura Swisher, Jessica Corbin, Catherine Schwartz. Well talk to ya in a whenever.
