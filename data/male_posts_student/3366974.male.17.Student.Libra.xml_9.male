I should probably explain the events leading up to today, so you have a better idea of what is going on. First, they believed me to have ADD, and they still do. The put me on Concerta, and it seemed to work. However, I refused to take the medication any longer because I felt the side effects were too negative. Turns out, I wasn't even having sideffects from the actual medication itself, but from my own paranoid mind. This is when they concluded that I also had OCD. From what I understand, OCD is common with people who suffer from ADD. OCD, for those who don't know, can be credited to those who are obsessive about something (in the sitcom Friends, Monica is obsessed with cleaning), but that isn't the only symptom. OCD can cause paranoid attacks among other things, and this is what my problem is. I'm overly paranoid when it comes to health issues, and this is my main problem and focus at the moment. First, I must treat my OCD before I can treat ADD. (Since I won't and can't take the ADD medication without having Paranoid Attacks caused by the OCD). Of course, I am paranoid about taking the OCD medication itself, and there are some side effects that scare me. So I didn't take the medication that they presribed for that. It has been a few months since they issued it (Zoloft) for me to take. During that time I have experienced some rather unpleasant Paranoid Attacks, and decided that I would go ahead and take the medication, pending another doctor visit (which is what today's appointment is). In case your wondering what the side effects that I'm worried about are, they are as follows: Sexual Sideffects that may include painful errections, Tremors, and Seizures. There are more minor sideffects, but they aren't bad enough to bother me. They tell me that there is a very slim chance of me actually having any of those sideffects, but it doesn't do much good to ease my mind since there is still a chance, however slim. But, I've decided I'd rather test my fate, because I can't continue to live my life the way I am now. Paranoid Attacks are very unpleasant, and they must stop.  I will update you in a few days on my situation, if I'm still around to report on it.
