So far, we have lost two valuable free agents- Krystyof (sp?) Oliwa and Craig Conroy.  Out of the unrestricted free agents, I expected Oliwa to go. He's got skill, but it mostly consists of smashing the shit out of guys. Which is cool. He doesn't score very much, but when they do, they're great goals! Craig Conroy, who I've mentioned before, is a wonderful player. One of the premier playmakers in the game, running around setting up Jarome all over the goddamned place. Two valuable players. Gone. On the other hand, my Leafies are doing the RIGHT THINGS. Gary Roberts and Joe Nieuwendyk- signed! for at least two years.  Darryl, be like Pat Quinn.
