Speaking Clock - The Facts :   The BT Speaking Clock has also been known as TIM (the three-letter code, short for TIMe, that users dialled in the days of alphabetical dials !).    The BT Speaking Clock has been ticking 24-hours a day, seven days a week since 24th July 1936 – which is 67 years, more than 24,000 days, more than 586,000 hours or 35 million minutes !   Originally the accuracy of the BT Speaking Clock was one-tenth of a second, it is now correct to within five thousandths of a second !   There have only ever been three voices for the BT Speaking Clock, apart from a two week period in March 2003 when Lenny Henry did a special version of the Speaking Clock in aid of Comic Relief  :   -         A London telephonist, Jane Cain was the first voice in 1936 and lasted until 1963.   -         Miss Pat Simmons, a supervisor in a London telephone exchange became the second voice from 1963 until 1984.   -         The present voice, belongs to Brian Cobby (73) who was an assistant supervisor at Withdean exchange in Brighton. He became the first male voice at 11 am on 2nd April 1985. Brian Cobby, an actor by profession before he joined BT, was selected from 12 finalists in BT’s Golden Voice competition, on 5th December 1984.   Before Brian Cobby worked for BT, he recorded the “5-4-3-2-1… Thunderbirds are go!” for the theme tune to Gerry Anderson’s TV series !     Brian Cobby has received fan mail from ‘mature ladies’ who say they listen to him late at night when they can’t sleep !     The longest distance call to the Speaking Clock is from a factory in Hong Kong, which makes handsets for the VideoPlus VCR programming system. The in-built clock is set to British time, courtesy of BT's Speaking Clock service.    The timing of most television programmes is synchronised to the BT Speaking Clock as well, so when your local station goes over to ITN for the News at Ten, this is done "at the third stroke".     The world’s most famous clock, Big Ben, checks its time with the BT Speaking Clock and many major organisations have permanent feeds of the clock from BT into their private internal phone systems so employees can check the time without making an outside call.   The 1936 Speaking Clock was an of array of motors, glass discs, photocells and valves and took up the floorspace of a small room! The current Speaking Clock, with a built-in crystal oscillator and microprocessor logic control, the complete apparatus is made of solid-state microchips and occupies no more shelf space than a small suitcase does – and has no moving parts at all.     Describing the BT Speaking Clock as a National Institution is probably fair, since as a nation we seem to be remarkably keen on ringing up. Even in its first year, 1936, the service registered nearly 13 million calls and it was not a nationwide service then - that came six years later. Today we make around 100 million calls a year and that's a lot of watches being checked.   The original Speaking Clock message was recorded and replayed rather like the optical sound track of a film and the equipment represented the state of the art of current technology in those days. This lasted until 1963, when it was replaced by more modern recording technology, using a magnetic drum. It gave way to the present digital system in 1984 and this has no moving parts at all.  The unquestioned accuracy of the Speaking Clock has also led to the association of Accurist Watches, who since 1986 have sponsored the BT Speaking Clock announcements. With those 100 million calls a year, this may well be the most frequently heard advertising message of all time.    But what did people do before the speaking clock was invented if they wanted a time check? Simple: they rang the operator and asked her the time by the exchange clock on the wall, but this was not precise to the second, nor could the exchange always answer just when the customer wanted. The first genuine speaking clock machine was introduced in the USA in 1927, coming to Paris in 1933, The Hague in 1934 and Switzerland in 1935. But automatic time service (of a Heath-Robinson kind) had been available to telephone users in San Francisco since the late 19th century; by listening for to an observatory clock at least a minute and decoding clicks and single and double buzzes against some detailed instructions you could set a pocket watch-but it helped if you already knew more or less what the time was ! A proper speaking clock is far less trouble !   - from  urlLink  Telephones UK
