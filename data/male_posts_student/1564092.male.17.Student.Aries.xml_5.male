I have been talking to Kourtney and Liz, who are already there on campus because Kourtney's mom is a chaperone and Liz is a section leader, and they are all revved up. They are entering the room decorating contest thing and from the sound of it it seems like it is pretty awesome. I found out my room number from Liz who was bored so she went to look for me and I think I remember exactly where the room is. She was counting the doors and such and telling me in relation to the room I was in last year. It seems like we are surrounded by freshmen, not always a negative thing and it also seems like we are around chaperones which sort of sucks. If Sarah had anything to do with where I'm at! lol It should be gravy though. I have been driving a lot in the past two days. I drove all the way to Tanger today, down 1-55 to avoid the highway for a little while. It was pretty awesome I gotta say. I have driven just about everywhere we have gone but there are still some rocky moments like when I had to cross over two lanes of traffic to get into the turn lane to turn in somewhere. I wasn't ready for that at all, but we all survived so it wasn't to bad. I'm rambling... I haven't even started packing for camp yet to be honest. I will in the morning. Just have to throw some clothes together and my bathroom stuff and my instrument and my laptop and my reading for school and some magazines and well maybe I should pack some. There is more to pack then I thought. Oh yeah, tv too. Band camp is about having a good time,  making some new friends , playing with  LOTS OF AIR  during sectionals, well, really all the time for that matter, and just having a good time. I said having a good time twice so I am going to make it my personal mission to make sure everyone is having a good time. lol Like I said before, I am taking my computer so expect some posts through out the week. One of my plans of taking pictures during the day and uploading them at night feel  way  through so I was very disappointed about that so I am going to take a disposable camera and hope that I get some decent pics to put up on my site. It really sucks though but I guess I will just have to understand the situation (which I don't in anyway) and just go and have a kick ass time like I am going to do. Okay, enough is enough. I am talking around in circles but one more thing. I want to send out an honest thank you to the person that helped me with money while I went clothes shopping today. I bought a bunch of new digs and I can't wait to wear them. I  hate  shopping but I love spending money so go figure. On my next post I will be reporting from BAND CAMP! Cheers!
