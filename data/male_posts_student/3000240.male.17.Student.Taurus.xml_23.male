I really can't stand the whole thing this year, it all seems pretty pointless, and I guess it's going to be this way until I'm 80 and in a wheelchair whilst valuing every day I continue to breath.  The individual who had been backstabbing me to "Mr X" never owned up, so I must take it that they were rather cowardly and quite falsely angry at me for some reason. So whoever you are you anully retentive fool, I hope you die slowly in your own filth as the devil castrate's you.  The silent treatment I'm handing out to my Mother is working a charm, as, after only three days she has cracked already. Little does she know of how long I can extend this epic feud with her until she eventually breaks well and truly; more so than she's ever known. I know it may seem harsh of me for doing such a thing against my own mother, however I feel quite betrayed by what she's done, which Is a bit too personal to post on the internet even for me, but believe me when I say you'd feel just as angry if it had happened to yourself. So I came to the conclusion after such a brilliantly monumental start, that I might use these mind games to its full effect for a little while longer - my next plan being to refuse to see her at all during my birthday, which I know to most of you doesn't seem like a harsh thing, but considering how much I know she values spending the day with me, and the fact that there's no college, this opportunity seems priceless. Oh how I love being cold . . . xBuBzx
