My birthday is in a few weeks, I don't want much, just some hardware things, a game. I want to get Tales Of Symphonia for the gamecube. It came out yesterday and I want it so badly, but alas, I must wait. >_  Things are doing fine here, soccer every sunday could be better, but I'm not complaining.  Hakuna Matata, Anita.
