So I understand now and I am starting to feel a bit better knowing what actually happened.  Today is my Dido's (Dee doh, is grandpa in Ukrainian) Birthday (he's turning 84), and I'm making him a card and im getting ready to go at the same time. I hope the party will be fun.  The Flames have a game this evening and I plan on watching it at my Dido's house. I sure hope the flames win this game to put them back on top of the series with a 2-1 game lead! Last game the flames lost 4-1 so the series got tied up at 1 so today we're gonna win and get that lead!!   Music Lost Prophets - Last Train Home
