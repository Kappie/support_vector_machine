The rest I will write up from my pocket note book and then date them as if I had done them live but this will be the only live one.  So Italy... well it's nice enough - I'll be posting my full conclusions on my last post which will be dated as tomorrow but will be posted the day after tomorrow - well it doesn't seem to make much sense now but when it is all done it should all figure.  To the present - they do cyber cafes as well as anywhere - a QWERTY keyboard is still a QWERTY keyboard (Unlike in the Czech Republic where is a QWERTZ - the only difference but amazingly quite annoying!). The machine I haveto use is a lovely black Dell which I have become quite fond of during the past 10 minutes... anyway time presses - I only bought 15 minutes and that is disappearing quite rapidly!  Ciao to all... Fabius!
