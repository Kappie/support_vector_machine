Basically my job is to ferry them from station to station all around my camp, make sure they reach and leave each station according to the allowed timing and answer any questions along the way. Sounds like fun, but they are hard to control. And with two sessions for today, morning and afternoon, I find myself drop dead tired. I believe even more so than if I were in my workshop doing normal work. Strange.  However it's good to be able to interact (barely, the timings are quite tight) with these up and coming youngers and have an insight into their minds. Mainly they found the whole deal to be boring and a waste of time. Can't really blame them. If I were in their shoes, young and innocent, everything so peaceful and plaicd, I'll find it boring too.  Something twirls in my Headware as I realise that I may not have fallen far from the tree that they find themselves currently on. I may no longer be young, or even innocent, but I feel that I sometimes have blinders on my optic systems. I dont think I have seen enough of the "real world" to be prepared later on, that this island in the Datastream that I call home is really that...an island, sheltered from the oceans of the world. What is going to happend when I finally, trully step up to the Edg3, am forced to open my eyes and look down?  Tomorrow is another two more sessions of ushering. Wish me all the best.   >
