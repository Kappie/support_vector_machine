I have a little bit of saddness though, I didn't get everyone I wanted to sign my yearbook... Oh well I'll just have to keep in touch with them over the summer so there is no need for a memory in some ol' book...  So what is going on with all of you this summer? So far I've heard some pretty great stuff; Cancuun (yeah I know I spelled it wrong...), France, Jersey Shore, Deleware, Ocean City, and some other great ideas...  Hmm I'd have to say this summer is going to be way to cool.  We have to hook up and do something that mean YOU. If you've got ideas let me know.  Hmm I really should be making Chad's Duck Tape Boxers... I think I'll go do that soon.  Right now I just have to say WHEE HEE WHOOPIE DOO WHOO HOO YEE HAA!!  -Dan V
