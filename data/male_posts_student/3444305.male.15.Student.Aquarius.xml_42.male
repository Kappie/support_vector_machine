He just needs to shut up that stupid retard. Screaming about a stupid water gun, god. Oh but I love you Nate. So I got up, and had nothing to do because I have no life! I sat inside all the way till 7:30 tonight. Well my mom brought me home two Cheesy Gordia Crunch's from Taco Bell so that was good. Wow I would die for those things. I found out my good old friend Jerry is into Brand New finally. After about two years, at least someone else has some good taste in music. But other than that I sat at home doing nothing because I have no life. Then, Kyle asked me if I wanted to go riding at 7:30 so I said yes because I oviously had nothing else to do. So we rode around, went to K-Mart, Stopped by the Cherry Festivle for a little, then just rode around till about 8:50. It was cool but for the first half hour it like peed on us from the sky. Stupid mist, you can burn. But then it stopped so it was all good on earth again. Kyle, I still can't believe that girl. Totally lost all my expecations for her. Oh well, that's life. Some of you might have seen just that part of the article. That's because I stopped in the middle of writing this and went upstairs. So I thougth what the heck I'll publish half of it. So that's what I did. I really have nothing else to say. I just ate some beef stew. That was good. Donut holes are good too, just had some of those also. I was talking to Haley and made myself look like a complete idiot when I asked where Arkansas is, I still feel really wierd about it. I never knew that was how it was spelled. It has Kansas in it so I was like Ar-Kansas? I was so confused. But then she explained lol. And I'm an idiot. Well I have nothing else to say.
