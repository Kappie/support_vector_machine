Most of these entries has been random entries on waht i did, and little side notes and shit.  And you know why?  Cause i don't really have anything to rant about....i mean, sure shit pisses me off, or makes my head think, but it's never anything serious.  Like that whole Passion movie, i'm sure millions of people online ranted thier fucking mouths off about it....it's almost like your required to rant about that movie now....for me? naw...not worth the time and effort.  i rather be ranting about how fucked up this country is.  I mean, think about it....look how much money is going in Beauty products....billions of dollars, and when a harmless add comes on tv, like 1 in 4 acutually call...come on now people, what the fuck man, you cant possibly have 3 bucks to spend somewhere else....or how bout all the fucking Media, and how it controls our lives, ever think of that shit?  Everything revolves around media now, no matter what form it's in, and it;s really controlling how we think.  Don't belive me? Go watch fucking Bowling For Columbine, the best fucking documentary i've ever seen.  That'll open yours eyes....Look, i'm sorry people, but if you haven;t got it by now, i'm kinda fustrated.....no, acutally, i just wanted to waste time....lol, ya, sorry, i wasn't gonna beak down or anything....well, peace out, i once again have a pretty busy day, bye bye
