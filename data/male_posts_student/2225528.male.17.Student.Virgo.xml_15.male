Sometimes lifecan't bewhat u want it to be.. it's really hard to cope with this "long and winding road" without misleading urself.. all u can rely on are only ur friendsand people that cares..Thinking back.. I wonder.. am I actually alone in this world or is there anyone or anything that's worth living for? LoL.. well answer's pretty obvious.. NOTHING..      Pressingthe keys on the keyboard now atT1 cybercafe at 3rd mile with my buddy.. One's a total online game freak and one's a net surfer.. guess which one's me..the staff'spulling down the panes and me and my friend still stuck to the monitor screen..       left..
