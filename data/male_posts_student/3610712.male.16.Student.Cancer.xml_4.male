On the 22nd, I basically did nothing, just slept and played videogames. On the 23rd, I was supposed to get my driver's license but there was a fuck up, so I had to reschedule the test for July 1st. Yesterday I slept, sat around, watched the NBA Draft (the Lakers chose Sasha Vujacic and Marcus Douthit, woohoo), then cleaned my room. Then I talked to my Sarah for awhile, after which leaving to watch a movie and go to sleep. Today my dad woke me up at noon to tell me that he was leaving for the beer garden at the Flower Festival. After being awakened, I got on the computer and chatted it up. Sarah left at 2:30 to go practice for the parade tomorrow, so I mowed the grass and then took a shower. And now I am here. That is all. Tchao.
