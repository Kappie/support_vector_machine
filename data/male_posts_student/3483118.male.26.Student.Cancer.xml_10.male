That's hogwash.ButI'm not just setting up a straw man -- plenty of people really believe that.   However, sometimes you come across a piece of good news that, while not the biggest story of the day, nonetheless deserves to be highlighted. From the "World in Brief" report in yesterday's Washington Post:    â€¢ ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan held talks at a regional conference, hoping to speed the pace of peace talks that have raised hope that the nuclear-armed neighbors might permanently end decades of hostility.  Foreign Minister Khursheed Kasuri met his Indian counterpart, Natwar Singh, over breakfast at an Islamabad hotel. "Our talks today were frank, they were honest, they were candid, they were friendly and they were warm," Kasuri said afterward. "Every issue of concern was raised by me and every issue of concern was raised by Mr. Natwar Singh."    Great to hear, no?   In other news, I'm homeward bound from the beach and the Nej Page is up again.
