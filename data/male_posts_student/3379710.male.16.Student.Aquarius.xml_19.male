Making your own runes take time but is worth it. Go to the Duke in Lumbridge Castle, second floor. Talk to him. Then, after excepting the quest, go to Draynor Village. You will find a southern path where you see a cement port. It is actually the way to the Wizard's Tower. Then, go through, talking to a bunch of NPC's to get quests. Then, back to the first floor. Use the trap door. Deliver the Talisman to the only talking NPC. Go into another room. You will see a skull. Pick it up, but be prepared: A skeleton will attack. It will disapear at 1/2 health. This is the skull from the Restless Ghost quest!First, go to the Rune shop in Varrock. Talk to the shop keeper. Give him the item. On your way to Draynor, stop by the Lumbridge Graveyard. Put the skull in the coffin to gain quest points. Then, go back to the Tower and talk to the Wizard again.   Second:Make sure you have a pick ax. And inventory space. Select teleport from either the Rune shop keeper or the Wizard. They will teleport you to where to mine.. Rune Essences!   Third:After filling up, use the portal. Then, use locate with the air talisman. It will bring you near Draynor if you follow the pull. Select 'use' when at the stones and boulders. Click on the big stone called 'Mysterious Runes'. With the talisman selected, it will teleport you to the Altar of Air.  Select to use the Essences with the Altar. All your essences will be turned into Air Runes. Congratulations! You crafted your first runes!  Fourth: At lvl 2 runecraft, kill imps. They will probably drop the Mind Talisman. Use locate and you will come to MORE mysterious runes. Select use and click on the big rock, as before. You may repeat this when your new lvl says you can craft the next type with the talisman and location of the next type.  Fifth: Now, with about 1000 runes of each type, as you may have unlimited completed runes, attack a Warrior in the wilderness. You will probably when, if it is within 10 lvls. Next, train defensively with your staff.  Sixth: Beat a Ranger repeatedly with your staff. It will count as warrior, the Ranger's weakness. You have beaten the Archer!
