Boy, I was dead wrong! I found Special Edition Titan A.E. on DVD in widescreen format for only $6.88 (Canadian funds). Daredevil Special Edition DVD in widescreen format for only $9.96 (Canadian funds). Spawn 2 Collector's Edition DVD, which turned out to be an animated type film, or series that I thought was awesome, for only $6.88 Canadian.  Then I scooped up Metal Arms: Glitch in The System, a pretty damn good game, for Xbox which only ran me $18 Canadian. Also, I contemplated buying Whiplash for Xbox which was only $17! But I decided I had already put a dent in my GameCube savings fund by about $50 so I'd stop there :p  Besides electronics I also picked up an awesome Spider-Man 2 poster for $5.77, which filled in a big gap on my wall, just waiting for a good poster.  Next I moved on to the toys section, and found two packs of Marvel MiniMates I still needed for my collection, bought both of them at $8.92 each.  All in all, a good shopping day :)      ------------------ Thanks, ~Brian M
