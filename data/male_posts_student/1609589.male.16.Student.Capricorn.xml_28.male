I was talkin to my mom today, and for some reason we were talking about the Boston trip, and she said "what else was fun besides Blue Man Group and Arlington St.?"  Jesse: "Well, the sunset cruise was pretty fun... if not cold. Really really cold." Mom: "Oh? Meet anyone?" J: "Yeah, we went on the cruise with Tom.. whatshisname" M: "Shade?" J: "No, not shade, even though we did meet him... *cough* .... he is one of the many Tom's that have been interns at our church before... haha" M: "Oh, i think i know who you're talking about"  So we both tried to explain him to eachother for a minute, and right at the exact same time we both said the same thing.. "The guy with the big teeth?"  Haha, that was so hillarious! We both started cracking up loud-- so loud we interrupted the dog class going on.... but i didn't care. Those people are obsessed anyway.  I hate talking about people i dont hate like that, but, damn, those are some huge teef!  I also forgot that I was back in the mother of all Christian states in the U.S. because my mom was saying "Yeah, when I met Tom(we figured out his last name was pronounced Belote, but im not sure if thats how you spell it...) He seemed to be really... what's the word... high strung?"  And I said "Oh, like he would be a fundamentalist right wing christian guy?"  She said "Shhh!!! but... yes."  I got a couple glances from that one, i said it like I wasn't christian! ~gasp~  ...but I didn't care. Those people are obsessed anyway.   I had burned a copy of the Blue Man Group album for my brother (hes such a little moocher- mom and dad buy everything for him and i have to pay for everything- hed be rich if he didnt go to the mall with the goof troop(what i call his new friends) all the time), he brought it in the car to the dog show today. We were listening to the White Rabbit track (COA people know), When my mom started singing along with the lyrics, my brother looked at her like a deer looks at an oncoming train... but if the deer looked suprised. That's how he looked. He couldnt, for the life of him figure out why or how my mom knew these lyrics.  It was written in the 70's!!!! By Jefferson Airplane! Stupid band name, gr8 song. I hate who sings it in the blue man group album, tho- some stuck up french chick saying in the interview "i wanted to chang-uh the song-uh from what jefferson-uh airplanuh did in the 70'suh"  I dontuh likeuh frenchuh peopleuh. Even though i'm like... heh.. a 10th french meself. I hate meself. I dont wanna be german, french... I wanna be Italian- at least irish! Come on!  At least i'm a part Scottish-irish.  Woah, how did i switch topics that fast? Train of thought.... it's coming... getting closer... almost here... it's finally here.... Oh shit, its gone! Where'd it go?  I confuse me sometimes.  Well, that's enough out of me, Now returning to your regularly scheduled life.
