Ok...D-day getting a bit close. Today I saw a potential summary of what is going to happen after that. I sat at home. My parents weren't home, and I sat at home and played at least 11 straight hours of video games. Only interrupted by pizza and soda. Someone forgot to call me, and the other group of people claimed nothing was going on. Anyways, I played games. All day. That's what I do, I guess.  There may only be a few days left until there is a lot less meaning to waking up in the morning, but I will not be defeated by depression again. This has happened to me too many times in my life. Once is too many. Three is WAY too many. It wont happen again. I...think..  A story to be continued.  As if that will decrease the pain.  How shattered I will be When only a ghost remains Yet... Somehow I know I will survive. It may seem contradictory. But...My bones shake with hope!
