Not without reason, definitely...after all, they actually spent taxpayers' money on educating a generation of PAP-haters (almost synonymous with Geppers) ! Haha.  Yesh, im really loyal to S'pore...in fact, if a war happened in s'pore, i would definitely contribute my money to the war funds...after i immigrate overseas. Oh well. Anywayz, i dont understand why but i just adore PM Goh Chok Tong. He just looks so wise and sensible, and seems like a person you can always depend on. Then again i dislike other PAP ppl like Lee Hsien Loong. He just looks, well, treacherous. Rather like Scrooge in A Christmas Carol.  Actually, despite my self-proclaimed loyalty to S'pore, I didnt attend the NDP celebration todae. i went out with joy. We went around half of S'pore, to City Hall and its surroundings (CHIJMES, Raffles Hotel etc), to Bugis, its shopping mall and the flea markets in its vicinity (recognised someone from rj and zaoed quickly), to Bedok and the East Coast Park (found the route gaoshan and i took last week back to the mrt), and finally made our way back to Pasir Ris. And in all, we rode the Mrt 5 times, and travelled on a bus 2 times.  It was a rather weird time, as we were thinking of things to do along the way. In fact i was suggesting biking, rollerblading, billiard...but joy adamantly refused and bossed her way round to direct me to shopping centres and the like. It was really irritating when she kept asking me what to do and then decide everything herself. The original purpose of today was to explore places in S'pore we havent. In the end we were just disillusioned with leisure and recreation in S'pore. Sigh. She suggested we save money till the December Hols to try out a certain theme park that i forgot. It would probably be much more fun (again, according to her wishes).  I'm treating her rather like my female elder cousin, who brings me out to play, treats me to drinks and lets me relax myself. I like my cousin, of course. I dont really know what she treats me as. Probably just a friend. No matter what, it is all very enjoyable.   Ce n'est plus une ardeur dans mes veines cachee;   C'est Venus toute entiere a sa proie attachee.
