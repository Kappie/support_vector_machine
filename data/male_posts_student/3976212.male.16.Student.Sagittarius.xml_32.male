I got some Tylenol 3 from the dentist today..and I'm a little scared to take them because I was reading about them on  urlLink Erowid  (a site that contains great information before using a drug) and it says you can get addicted to the codeine with less than 3 tables a week! They also say the withdrawl isn't too bad, but still uncomfortable and often people will go to long lengths to avoid it. I might try one later today because my tooth pain is getting worse. I need my damn surgery!! I watched the meteor shower tonight..It wasn't horribly great or anything, but definetly something that wasn't worth missing. But seeing the northern lights the other day was way more interesting than that. I have seen meteor showers before, and tonight's where not the best-but the lights was the first time ever, and I have always wanted to. Basicly now I am still deciding whether to sleep tonight or not...I prolly shouldn't-I'm not even tired and it's 4:11am. Whatever, I'm still chatting online..few are online tonight though. Oh well.. I went on a good bike ride today, It was a good hour/possibly more I wasn't keeping track. I rode up this hillbilly road and ended up at the Freeway! Crazyness, but an awesome ride. David is leaving on Friday, and tommorow is when I see him last I guess, he's borrowing $40 from me tommorow for gas! Well, I shouldn't advertise it too much. hehe too late.
