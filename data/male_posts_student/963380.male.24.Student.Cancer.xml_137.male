So momentous that should statuary be erected in honour of this day it would dwarf the very planet that created it.  Today is the last day that I work with Glen in communications. This is akin to the last of the Nazi's being hunted down and sent off to The Hague. So Long, Farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, Goodnight!  I'd like to say I'll miss him, but if I took a decent bead and really meant to, I'd probably hit him.  No more smug. No more self importance. No more irritating self righteous bastardism. I hope they break him. I'm not a hard guy to get along with - everyone else and I - well it's just peachy. Glen? Well Glen doesn't get along with anyone. Mister Heart-on-his-sleeve really needs to take the prick-o-metre down a notch.  In other news there's a girl at work who smells. It's really sad, because you want to say something but you don't. I mean complete litter box smell. It's really not cool. Also - she's never not eating. She's been told about it too - we're not allowed to have food or beverages on the floor (with good reason - sensitive equipment and such). I saw her finish a muffin and within moments whip out a chocolate bar. That's just not right.  How do you go about organizing an intervention?
