I purchased today "Inspiration" by William Hung! yay singing hits such as the awesomely sung "She Bangs", "I believe I can fly", "Hotel California", and "Y.M.C.A.".  It's awesome and I recommend you and your friends to go rush out and get this wonderful CD.  I got it for eight bucks, which is a deal!  Well anyways enough about Will Hung.  Fourth of July is coming up and everyone will be celebrating our wonderful country with blowing things up as always haha it's fun we all know it is (blowing things up).  I'll be doing what I done last year, boozing it up with my grandma.  I know how sad that sounds haha.  No, haha it's a lot of fun my grandparents come over and my grandma and I "take shots" (sips) of Smirnoff Ice so I won't be doing any DDing this year haha anyways hope you all have fun this Fourth of July!
