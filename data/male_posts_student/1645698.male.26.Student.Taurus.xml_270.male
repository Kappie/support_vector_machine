Are they cancelled all the way to next month, or just for a little while?  I indeed made it up here safely, though we ended up taking the Hudson Line instead of our car.  It was kind of funny, 'cause we couldn't get through to the Ossining house on the phone, then we could *barely* get down the stairs at 225th (icky, evil, slippery stairs - poor Nyisha) and then the ticket machine didn't work because it was too cold.  Snow was pretty, though - until we got off at Ossining and *finally* got through to family at the house and it took them nearly an hour to get there.  Between this and Rockefeller my toes may have to be amputated. ^_^  I was gonna call you, Hyper, but by then it was like ten thirty.  That was *my* evening!  I miss you guys, and I'll see you bright and early Monday morning. . . .you think Henkel'll let us in?  Hugs!
