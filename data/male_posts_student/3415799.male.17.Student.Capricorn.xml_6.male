We made a delicious butter sponge cake and then melted cadbury's chocolate all over it which (from a distance) looked like an Atkins diet-er's paradise...of course it was. We then went on to make chocolate chunk muffins, thats correct people, chunk - not measly pathetic chips but huge mama bear chunks of chocolate went into these! They were alright, made my head spin a tad with the amount of chocolate that was in them. Oh yes and how could i forget, we also made scones. Now the scones - bless them - were pathetic wee things that were kinda flat, normally one would expect scones to be huge with a somewhat regal look about them. But can i just tell you, these were the most delicious scones i have ever tasted!(fear not, this is going somewhere) So anyway, just to stop the mouthwatering for a moment, another of my chums called me later on thursday evening after the baking bonanza had passed, i thought he would be calling to tell me about his advanced higher chemistry exam which i thought was thursday...he was mad at me because the exam was wednesday and he could have been part of the bonanza fun. Therefore i compromised and agreeed to go round to his house the following day to bake some more (feeling a tad like Martha Stewart now). Sultana and raisin cookies we decided to bake, only one little problem: we have no sultana's or raisins nor do we have any money to buy some. However the baking most go on so we use what we have at hand...peanut butter and oatmeal.  Fair enough peanut butter is great but when you start pouring in dried porrdige into your baking thats just a wee bit eccentric. Anyway the moral of the story being...never, and i mean NEVER try these cookies, or at least if you do mke sure that your next to a reservoir. I almost lost my voice through dehydration from one bloody cookie! So if you dare to make these cookies and then go on to eat them...on your head be it! Just noticed that i really do have a nack for parenthesis!
