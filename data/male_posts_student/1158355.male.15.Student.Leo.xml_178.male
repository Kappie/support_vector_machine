Nobody's updating ebaumsworld, but my band has been getting lots of progression. It's granderful. We finished this really awesome song called The Man In The Middle. For Christmas, I got a bike, some video games (Mario Kart, Mario Party 5, Star Wars Rebel Strike and Medal of Honor Rising Sun), lots of cd's (A Perfect Circle, Korn, Puddle of Mudd, Limp Bizkit, Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions) and some movies. I also got a cd player that has 3 green, shiny nipple thingies on it. Santa treated me good, real good this year. I also bought a few new Matrix figures, the Smith and Neo Super Burly Brawl Scene (my favorite) and Morpheus sitting in his red chair next to the phone. And ya know, just other little things. Santa kicks ass. So let's see, basically nothing else happened. I saw my cousins alot this vacation. Now this is the end of the vacation and it's all depressing. Going back to school, oh god. I fucking hate school. Why is it the fucking law. I hate you school, I hate you laws. But I've said this millions of times so this is the last time I'm going to say it. This country sucks. But it's a new year so think positive. This country kicks ass. Bye.
