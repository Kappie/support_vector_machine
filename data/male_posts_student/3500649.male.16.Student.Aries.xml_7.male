I admit that I never found him as attractive as Sasi until he came 2 talk 2 me a few days ago. That trivial conversation Had broken the ice  melted my indifferent heart. He is different from Sasi. Sasi makes my heart beat with high velocity but Shaun gives me the impression of warmth and ease. I am comfortable talking 2 him  yearn 4 his friendship. Although I know our friendship only endure 4 a few days (coz he will forget about me very soon ) but 1 thing 4 sure, I â€˜ll regard him as my friend 4ever. The moment I share with him (though it was just merely a few minutes ) will I treasure forever. Shaun Quah, I love u  friendship forever.
