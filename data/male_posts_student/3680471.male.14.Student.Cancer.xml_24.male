Actually there were some good submissions today, like some bug game which was like centipede. It rocked. After that....hmmm. I stayed pretty much inside all day today. Im lazy. Cleaned a lot tonight to suprise my mom. I watched Mortal Kombat(that movie rocks) I was supposed to watch Aliens but never got around too it. Me and cassidy talk from 10 to 11 just about music. Geez. Thats someone you can talk too. Well thats an update for ya. Robbie comes back from his dads tommorow. He will call and say hello like 20 times when its noon and I should be sleeping. Maybe a basketball game tommorow guys. Well Im off!
