She was reffering to moving stuff around in her room, it ends up she wanted to change the furniture arangement and needed me and Nia to help.  We did it mostly without big burly man's help, by that I mean my dad.  Next, I go on the computer briefly but then my dad decides to clean out the garage.  That's only like three years of visible garbage (fortunately we ran out of storage space only three years ago), unfortunately my dad has the psychological disorder where he can't throw away any of his stuff.  That was pretty infuriating, and besides that I tend to get mad at him way to easily.  On my part, I suppose that's unfair.  So my mom is able to convince him to make me stop working so I can get some stuff for Tatiana's party that night.  So we go out to Joy-see Gardens (Me, Nia, Dad, and Grammy).  Mom explains her fight with Lauren escalating to me, really annoying stuff.  At the mall, mom is about to buy me two shirts, but dad is adamant against it "Why are we buying shirts here?" "Because I like them, dad." "No, we're going to Burlington Coat Factory."  Okay that was a little weird, but mom says to me says "Don't fight with him about it, he hates not being incharge."  So we go to Burlington Coat Factory.  After some fussing around this Indian guy, who must have been ultra-Dravidian because he looked completely black down to the bone structure until he talked, took my measurements.  Then I go find some nice shirts, my dad is insistent I pick more then one.  Then I get some pants.  Easy enough. Bought him his father's day gift early.  We needed to go to Short Hills for a gift certificate though.  So that was another trek.  We quickly buy the certificate and leave for home.  Things got weird once I got home.  My dad seriously picked out which clothes I was wearing, and it took my forever to convince him against it.  So after that, I felt kinda weird, he's never cared that much about me going to a party in the past.  At the party.  Tatiana's Ethiopian family *drool*.  Food, I really only had the sea food, and salad but it was tre yum.  We were at the Essex House in, to quote Kelz, Wo-Town.  It was pretty calm at first, some music from all over the ethnic and genre spectrum playing.  A few people were dancing not to a huge amount of black people there.  Still, awkward, I don't much like to dance.  So I sat around looking weird for awhile, and danced very little.  Haha, and the only reason I danced is because so few black people were there, I knew I wouldn't be heckled.  Haha.  Yeah, I need to learn the word for fear of new social situations.  That's me mos def.  But yeah, party was pretty cool, I'll upload the few good pictures I took tommorow.  Also, I have to prep for finals.  Robles is out to get me, so I have a shitload of stuff to do for his freakin' final.
