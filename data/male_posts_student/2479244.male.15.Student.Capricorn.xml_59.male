I am away from her for 9 hours and when I finally get to talk to her, I neglect her. It makes me feel like such a shallow prick, and don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that I'm  not  a shallow prick, I'm just saying that its stuff like this that makes it so apparent. I don't know, maybe its just because I'm bad with words. I mean, I can write and all, but its just hard to get my thoughts out with the right words. I wish for one day that she could spectate how my day and my thoughts go so she could feel the things I feel and hear the things I am too chicken-shit to say.  Geesh, I am such an emo-fuck.
