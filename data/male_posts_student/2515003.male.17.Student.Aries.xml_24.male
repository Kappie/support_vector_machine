Please refer to your dictionary, glossary reference, etc etc. Now All those smarty pants who just appreciate their own contribution and not others are requested to join the IdioticExunites Clan. The First two members have been decided  Akshay  Gursartaj. All others members who like to settle their personal scores on the  Natural Log of Exun  may also apply to join this Clan
