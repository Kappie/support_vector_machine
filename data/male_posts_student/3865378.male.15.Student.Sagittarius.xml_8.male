I don't think a Pedigree would finish him, and he has made Triple H tap out to the Crossface in two house shows prior to Bad Blood.   Randy Orton vs. Edge   Intercontinental Championship  Here we go... Since nobody has announced Evolution was banned from ringside, I am perfectly seeing Ric Flair at ringside using his dirty tactics to steal victory from Edge. So Randy it is.   Chris Jericho vs. Batista   Singles Match  Ah, the typical 'David vs. Goliath'. I'm gonna choose Chris Jericho, and I predict Batista is gonna tap out to the Walls Of Jericho.   Ric Flair and Eugene vs. La RÃ©sistance   World Tag Team Championship  Eugene is a promising wrestler and Ric Flair a much more experienced wrestler than La Rez. I predict Eugene and the Nature Boy will come out on top.   Matt Hardy vs. Kane   No Disqualification Match  Unfortunately, I predict Matt is gonna be man-handled by the Big Red Machine. As much as I like Matt Hardy, I predict Kane is pulling an easy victory.  These are the announced matches for Vengeance as of today. There may be more, just like it happened at the Great American Bash from SmackDown!. Is that's the case, I'll edit this post in order to contain the new matches, if there are any.
