I know there is going to be a 3 hour long memorial on every single local news program, and comedy central'll try and make some memorial with the hosts of the Man Show, and Yahoo's whole news story will be plastered with Bush commemorating 9/11 in iraq, and noone seems to understand 3 little words.  I DON'T CARE!!!  I know, i know, it killed people, we hate brown people now, whoopidy shit, it happened 2 YEARS ago, it's time to move on.  We have more important things to be doing than saying the pledges- North Korea has been threatening america for a while, I say we give them the attention they want and blow half of their damn country off the map.  "Oh no! There are innocent peoples in there!"  pfft- they could find their own way out if they REALLY wanted to... look at the mexicans swimming their way into america! Don't tell me they'll get killed.
