They usually are the Iraq War (no one ever argues the greater War on Terror) or the economy, which in the past couple of months has become somewhat of a non-issue, yet Kerry still stumps on it.  Even in these circumstances, people are wholly misguided.  Ask anyone why they disagree with the Iraq War and they honestly can't tell you!  The usual response is "Well, we have no right being there"  No right?  This opinion doesn't seem to jibe with our foreign policy for the last 200 or so years.  What right did we have in France in 1918 or 1944?  What right did we have launching massive air campaigns over the cities of Japan in 1945?  Or perhaps we were flawed in assisting South Korea against the aggression of China and North Korea.  What do all these things have in common?  The protection of and perservation of democracy.  Now some might argue how do you protect or preserve democracy in a place where it never existed (Iraq)?  My response would be to look to the democratization of Germany and Japan.  The democracy of the Weimar Republic failed in Germany in the years after WWI and before WWII, much less did democracy ever exist there before that time.  Why did we even bother to try post-WWII?  Same thing with Japan, why bother?    The answer is simple.  As Americans, most of us believe in the intrinsic good of democracy.  It is been bred in us.  America has been a place where people of all nationalities come to escape oppression and participate in democracy.  Americans believe, with just cause, that democracy should be spread throughout the world because the will of the people is infalliable versus the will of one or few.  No greater testimony can be given to these facts than the participation of former Eastern bloc countries in Iraq.  Besides Britain and Italy, there has been no greater European supporter of our mission in Iraq then the countries that suffered under the oppression of the USSR for too many years.  They know the horrors of dictatorship and they know now the beauty of democracy.  Now they are assisting another country in that vision.
