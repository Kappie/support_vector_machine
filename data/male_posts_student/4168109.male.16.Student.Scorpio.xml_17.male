I'm predicting that it will be cast away and derelict within a couple weeks. If you write in it for a whole month I'll go down on you, Zara.       urlLink G-D : HEH, WHAT A COPYCAT.      What, are You in like second grade, G-d? You ass.      G-D:  YOU.         Nice comeback.      G-D: {SMITES -chuck-}          -chuck-   ...or eat limes...
