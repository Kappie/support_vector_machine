I will give you a basic recap of the past couple of days.  Wednesday: This was a "B" day, so I had 5, 6, 7 and 8 periods. This means a couple of things. One, I had math. Two, I had english. Three, I got to see Dominique. Four, I had biology. All of those were pretty much uneventful. Although I got to be with Dominique, which was easily the highlight of my day.  Thursday: Customarily "A" days follow "B" days meaning I had periods 1, 2, 3 and 4. TA, Web-Page design and US History. These are not my favorite classes, but the are better than like, math or biology. Also, the first meeting of the Christian Club. It was very cool. They talked about the plans they had for the year. I "met" a few new Christians. Actually, they were people I knew, but I didn't know that they were Christian. It was pretty amusing because they used to annoy me until I found out that they were annoying me in the name of the Lord. Also during the meeting I signed a paper for leadership. This was my big news about the procrastination and the like. I might start at least co-leading Christian Club. I also got my lunch buddies to come next Thursday. I will probably go to the spot just before lunch to remind them. Oh! That is going to be a "B" day! W00T, I can talk with Dominique about it later. That means I will have an extra meeting every Friday. I might get to start doing something with my faith! It makes me so excited! I despise, I loath  urlLink tables ! They are such a pain and the one I had to do wasn't much better. It was funny though, because I had finished coding it by hand before most people were done with the first couple of columns.   Friday: *YAWN*. Again, a "B" day. I got to see Dominique, and she asked me how Christian club went, even though I told her about it yesterday. Pretty funny stuff. She wrote me a note in code and I read it, and then later I went to visit her at work and she had written me a longer note. She is awesome! Anyways, we also had a sub in biology today. It was funny because he is a P.E. teacher. I didn't think they were qualified to sub for biology. Anyways, that was the extant of my school day. Later my parents had some friends over and I had to watch their son. It was so boring because all he liked doing was play video games and even though I really like video games, it really isn't my whole life. I fell asleep for like half an hour, quite humorous.   Today: I hurt myself on the trampoline, but it doesn't really hurt anymore. I was trying to do a backflip and shoot the basketball in the hoop right next to it at the same time. I got the ball in the hoop, but I landed on my eye. Trampoline burns already hurt enough, one under the eye doesn't help.  Anyways, the "Site o' the day" is regards e-greetings. A really good site with nice cards and a lot of options if you are a member (and it is free). Send me a card, I would love it.
