I'm hoping to make my class notes interesting enough so that I can post them on the Harvard outline library after the semester is done and feel confident that I'll amuse generations of law students to come.  At the very least, I'm probably amusing my seat neighbors.  In the case of Marshall v. Ranne:  There once was a hog who went wild Leaving a farmer beguiled He put out his hand Defense didn't go as planned But at least the hog didn't maul a child  And regarding the recent McDonald's lawsuit:  There once were some people humongous Who lived on this planet among us They loved all-beef patties That turned them to fatties At least the meat didn't have a fungus
