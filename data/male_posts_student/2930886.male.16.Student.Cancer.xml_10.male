But like Joe Dirt says keep on keeping on. Well what I am doing right ow is trying to make a program, specifically one for track meets. It is one that will do scoring and sorting and everything like that. I hope I can finish this by the time I am a senior so maybe we could try it out one day in a meet, or at one of our practice meets.
