Adi is on a mission to understand racism: this is why we are watching  The Birth of a Nation  (yes, we're still watching it).  Next, we'll be watching  urlLink Gone With the Wind .  I don't think that racism can be easily understood from an intellectual perspective.  It seems that it's more of an emotion than a concise thought -- how does one comprehend anger, or happiness?  These things are not easily quantified.
