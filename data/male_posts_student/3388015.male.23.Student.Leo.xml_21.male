I don't know Cindy's new number yet (well, now I do).  We went to the Strand in Brockport and watched Shrek 2.  It was pretty good, except the ending sucked.  Probably because the film caught fire and burned and they had to take 25 minutes to play the last 5 minutes of the movie.  Half the theatre got up and left.  We went to Mark's Pizzaria and ate a slice of pizza.  Seeing how I'm cheap, we went to Walmart to buy bottles of soda.  We also got taco bell.  We returned to the apartment and watched TV with Jake.  Then Jurrasic Park came on and we're watching that.  Jake offered ice cream and other stuff (well, we asked for it) so we're just hanging out.  Apparently there is a severe lightning storm with tornados going on.  They won't stop telling us on the TV.  Cindy is singing and plucking, it's real nice.  Jake asked Cindy to cuddle, Cindy asked Jake to shower.
