Although some of you may not agree with the things Michael Moore says, you can't help but realize the strange coincidences. Flying the Bin Laden family out of the country? The major role Halliburton played? The "censored" version of George W's military records? Very fishy... But no matter what political party you affiliate yourself with, I highly recommend seeing this movie. It will blow you away!  Chris
