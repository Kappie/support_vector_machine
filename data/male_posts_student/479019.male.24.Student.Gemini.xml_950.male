It's not cool to go down to San Diego, do a decent amount of drinking, get up at 7 AM for a graduation, and then be in Laguna Beach by noon for work.  The Adolescents show didn't work out because the bar had a no ins-and-outs policy and the band wasn't going to hit the stage until 1 AM. So I went to meet up with Steff and Julia in La Jolla and then we met up with Andy, Abby and and others down there in a pub.  Work was brutal due to my lack of rest. I pretty much fell asleep by 8:30 PM.  Well that trip from Berkeley and then going to work was worse.  ***
