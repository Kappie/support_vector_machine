Heres some quotes from todays conversation to help you understand the damned point  "Nat: I like you, but (as has DEFINITELY already been explained to her) I LIKE BEING BY MYSELF."  "Ben: and they all seem convinced that if they bug you enough you'll give up Nat: I'm like this 'cause I am. And they're wrong; they're just convincing me more that I'm right."  Does that get the message across, or am I gonna have to literally beat it into your head with some kind of garden tool?!  Ahem. Today was...to put it nicely...crap. Watched a video for about the 5th time this year in Geog about some Japanese farmer who laughs at the notion of himself dying. Onto History...the student teacher was being inspected by some random guy from some random Uni, so we all had to act like well-behaved little people who don't do anything wrong. Virtually impossible when Mark Bishop is sitting next to you being a complete idiot. As usual. English...sorta did a bit of work, mostly drawing funny little symbols on a big bit of paper. Maybe I should concentrate more and figure out wtf we're actually doing. Maths was boring, Science was even worse. Holly going on about Nat in every freakin way possible, and at every opertunity...Bishop flicking ink all over my face, etc.  Lunch was interesting though, some year 10s were doing 'chair bowling' where they were pushed along on the chair rack thingo into a load of chairs. Very interesting. See link to video below. And Nat, feel free to add anything to my rant =D  http://botprojectx.topcities.com/chairbowling.avi
