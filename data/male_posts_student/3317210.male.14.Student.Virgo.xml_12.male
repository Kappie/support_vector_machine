Well, that's how it generally feels when she walks by =) Words cannot describe such a feeling, but words have never been much good anyway =)  Stuff keeping details to a minimum... I don't think anyone has read this journal yet, so stuff it, it's a journal for myself! =P I know a crush usually occurs due to a physical attraction (which is certainly the case lol) but she does have some depth to her. She takes Latin, which is difficult, and is very kind, although a little shy =) I know, this is all really small stuff and probably doesn't mean anything to anyone but me... But... Well... In a way, I'm my main audience, so if you really want, skip to the next section, cuz I'm going on =P She had her books in my way this morning, and she said in the sweetest way "Oh, sorry"... Yes, very very small, but... Yeah =P I guess what I really like about her is she isn't outspoken, she's not zany, she's not loud, she's just, in the best possible description, seems a little shy =) I doubt she likes me unfortunately, and if I really want to a go, and ask her out, I may have to take a very very large leap. But before any of that, I just need to make some sort of small connection... I remember reading in an entry to CGTalk's 'Lost and Found' sketch competition, a little picture. Supposedly someone lost their gym card in the university dormitory hall, so he went to return it to the room number. He knocked on the door, and out popped the a fabulously beautiful girl... Well, that would be the perfect, absolutely heavenly, sort of way to connect to her for the first time. Of course, that's implying that anything like that happens out of Hollywood movie sets or children's stories, and even then the guy who met the girl didn't go out with her, but was merely 'haunted by her beauty' or something to that effect. Well, chances are it's never going to happen, but I'll find a way... I mean, it couldn't be worse than a million to one chance, or at least perfectly equal to it =P   Never play leap-frog with a unicorn, Murphy's Law states. This beautiful unicorn may make me break that golden rule...    urlLink       ----  Firefox 0.9 came out today =P I've already downloaded it and am going to install it after I finish this post. If you're getting sick of Microsoft, or Internet Explorer crashes on you/attacks you with spyware, go to  urlLink Mozilla.org  and try either Mozilla or Firefox out (Firefox looks a lot better and is much more slimline)  ----  I'm failing in my attempt to use every moment to its fullest. But I'll try to keep the practical part of the theory in full effect, no matter which way the coin falls... I just need something to get me moving again!  ----   Creativity  I just noticed something, all my ideas are based on quality. They should be based on quantity, because you can always develop an idea later down the track, but you may only have the stimuli at that moment to create an imaginary masterpiece. To help me develop a new way of innovation, I have enlisted the help of a random word website. Very random, not punctually random =P I'll take the first ten and try and write down what comes to head first, creative or non-creative.  ( urlLink site for random words )  Damn! Site's out at the moment due to DNS problems affecting the net (Slashdot story ( urlLink here )  New temporary word generator here -  urlLink Word Generator   This isn't quite as good as the other, as the other generates random words, this just generates made up words... But what the hey =P      * handian - An ancient culture who live ontop of the vast forests of floating sea-weed. The sea-weed growth is so thick that it creates a hard surface for them to survive on.     * rendeleckilopetels - (rend-el-ec-il-o-pet-els) A telepathic condition that the gods give some humans for their own amusement. Rendeleckilopetels allows you to see that you will injure yourself, but not how, therefore making you know you are going to hurt yourself with no preventitive measures! For example, you may know you are going to feel an intense 'pain' in your crotch, but you don't know exactly what'll cause it, so they avoid angry women, baseball balls, and any projectiles, until, when still trying to avoid everyone, he doesn't pay attention to the ground, and a man hole remains open. He falls, and... Well... You know =P     * pennelisits - I won't say what FIRST came to my head... This is strictly a PG13 site ;) A covert group of pencils who write propoganda, with topics similar to 'We're all wood you know' 'You'll never sharpen me alive' and an all time favourite 'Freedom to the LED!'     * ting -      * menter - It is the capacity that an object has to indirectly change the future of the world. If it has a high menter rating, for example, a nuclear bomb, it can instill a huge change, while a blade of grass may have a low level of menter.     * counkers -      * impingler - A person who makes a living by stealing barbed wire from prisons. These people are therefore indirectly responsible for a large percentage of successful prison escapes.     * ackiddentiont - A young      * dwely -      * belly -   ----   MUSIC SHOWCASE TOMORROW!  Music Showcase, when all the schools bands come together and perform. I have very high expectations for Senior Band, and ESPECIALLY Jazz Band =P Don't have quite too high expectations with Orchestra, but that's just because Mr Hutchins's such a great conductor, and musician in his own right =)   Center stage is set, the lights are focusing on you, and it's time to discover just what I'm made of!   The best thing though, of course, is I miss out on lots of school because I'll be going to the Hills Centre during the day to do final rehearsals and sound checks! WOOT! I also took last period off today to get a black suit/tuxedo type thing, to wear when we play in Jazz band. I was only told this morning, and kind of had to... Rush? =P Hopefully I'll fit in, but I am wearing silver, and spotlights on silver might blind a few people *sigh* Oh well =P And I have been getting a lot better with my music. I can play almost all of my jazz band pieces without fudging a single note (fudging in bands is a  lot  more common than you think). Heck, Justin hasn't even insulted me for the last few days =) (Justin is first trombone, in charge of being bossy and talented =P )  ----  Another night finished... Good night, and I wish you a happy future =)
