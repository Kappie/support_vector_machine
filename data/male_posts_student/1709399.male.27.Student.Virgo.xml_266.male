The Current Team looks even much better with Manmohan Singh-P.Chidambaram-Pranab Mukherjee-Jairam Ramesh (Who Amongst themselves are Alumni of Distinguished Schools like IIT,Harvard,Carnegie-Melon,MIT,Oxford !).Seems the Economic liberalisation would continue but would be "reforms with a Human face".Its also equally important that we get a very good HRD Minister(Primary School Education should be a key focus) , Agriculture Minister(Rural India needs to shine)and a pro-active External Affairs Minister.The next few days are going to be exciting and let us hope for the best.
