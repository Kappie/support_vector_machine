I had to wake up at around 6:00 AM to be out to the race course by 7:00, so it was a mistake to go to bed late last night. While last year we were assigned to water duty, this year we registered late, so we were stuck with course direction. Although the job title makes it sound like we just point runners in the right direction, our job was actually to barricade roads and divert traffic away from the course area. The problem was, we weren't provided with a map of the course, or even a list of the nearest open roads.   After about ten minutes on the job, I knew that I would be virtually worthless in directing people the right way, so I decided to go with my sister to aid the nearest water station. The runners thought that they had it hard running 10K, but they didn't have to stand for over an hour handing out water to 6,000 people. Pfff... Once the race was over, I went back to help take the barricades down and my brother had some pretty funny stories. It seems that many people became extremely angry when they couldn't drive on the blocked roads. In one case, a women on her way to church (on Saturday?), stopped right in the middle of the intersection and started screaming obsenities to herself. Right...  Anyway, in the big picture, the River Run is only a part of the annual  urlLink Wichita River Festival . It's our one claim to fame in Wichita. Basically, for a little over a week, Wichita hosts various events such as concerts, contests, art exhibits, craft sales, novelty shows, and fireworks. Although it was one of my favorite events when I was younger, I have increasingly lost interest in the festival. I don't exactly know why. Despite my disinterest, I went ahead and spent about two hours downtown with my sister this afternoon. I took some photos, got an airbrush tattoo, posed for a milk mustache photo, and wandered aimlessly. It was pretty cool.
