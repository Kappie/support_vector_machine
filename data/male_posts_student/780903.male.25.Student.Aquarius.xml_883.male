One of his most interesting stories was about how a Supreme Court clerk who relies on the site invited him down to Washington for a "backstage tour" and the clerks treated him like royalty for what he provides via his blog.  I was fortunate to have a chance to join Mr. Bashman and a bunch of other students for dinner after the speech.  I wish all of the lawyers I met during the recruiting process were as pleasant to have a meal with.  I thought he was great.    The speech will apparently be archived  urlLink here  on the Journal's web site.  My RealPlayer is corrupted so I can't tell if it's up yet.  P.S. I know I got back to my apartment before he got back to his hotel, and he still beat me to the post by 16 minutes.  Amazing.
