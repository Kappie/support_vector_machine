She talked about how she always worries about her dad, stays up half the night wondering if he's alive. Then she says that she's heartless, doesn't care about people, says they can all go to hell for all she cares, save for a few family exceptions. It seems she doesn't want to be that way though. That's why she wants to be a nun. She thinks that's the only way she'll be able to learn to care about others. I feel so bad for her. I know from experience that learning to care cannot be gained through any sort of career or anything external, really. It is an internal choice. I told her that, I hope she does think about it. I'll try to talk to her more. however (damn it), I forgot to save the conversation on MSN. oh well. she makes sense to me now, at least. I understand why she is the way she is. she doesn't appear to have an emotional side because she buries it. Not a good thing. I pray to God that I'll be able to help her like Josh I. helped me. He's the one who taught me to give people a chance, to talk to them, to CARE about others. he may not realize it, but he did.  I gotta go to bed, it's so late...almost 1am.  Oh, and on a side note, that pic was taken where we were staying near Branson.
