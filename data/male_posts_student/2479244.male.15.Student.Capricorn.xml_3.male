Four or five times. eek. Anyway, I'll let that rest (hah) for now. I guess that if I had any kind of mind-altering thoughts today, I should post them here. No real mind altering ones, but I do have a little story for you.  I got in the car with snow on my feet and a chip on my shoulder when my mom told me that I had to go tutor a little girl. I honestly was furious. I just wanted to get home, get some extra sleep, finish my homework, and factory make another one of my underachieving days. So, we go home, I do some stuff for about thirty minutes, then I leave to go tutor little Elle. When I was walking up the stairs I was angry. Some little girl had to take up my time because my mom volunteered me for some more damned service. Oi vey. So we're waiting at the door, I'm getting ever belligerent because of the cold trying to bite off my ears. Then the lady opens the door and I guess that looking inside the house made me realize it wasn't going to be so bad. I don't mean for people to take that the wrong way, but something about that house just calmed me down. So I walk in, and I was looking around, and noticed a little girl sitting at a table eating some food, a couple papers on the table. So, after meeting her mom, I sit down and talk to her, and I started to help her with the math she was having trouble with. From what I had understood from before, her mom and my mom made it sound like she wasn't at all good at math, but the fact of the matter is that she was really smart. So, after we cleared up the math and she told me she understood everything, my mom decided we should leave. The funny thing is that when Elle smiled at me because she understood something or thought my little tricks were funny, it seemed to make all of that work with her a lot more valuable than sleeping another day away. So I left, feeling a lot better than I did before. I guess helping people out and using a little of your own time isn't always that bad.  You really ought to try it some time.
