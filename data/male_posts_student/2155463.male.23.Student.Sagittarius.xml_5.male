Anyway, as I was drifting off (you know, in that semi-asleep haze) a thought popped into my head that I really never appreciated before.  Sometimes I like to play around with certain issues in my head when I'm drifting like that (something that keeps me awake for far too long sometimes), and arguments concerning spiritual relativism (and relativism in general) are one of them.    So suddenly it occurred to me that the primary spiritual leaders of every other religion in the world went to Hell - a morbid thought on one hand, yet something that should have been so obvious to me that it was startling to realize I had never thought about it before.  Ghandi, Mohommed, Smith, Buddha, Confuscious - as much as we might sometimes look at the teachings of any of them and see wise insights into human character or interaction (I certainly think that non-Christians can make viable insights into humanity based upon reason, although virtually all of their spiritual maxims are flawed), the end result of all their teachings was that they went to Hell.  And everyone who follows their teachings is headed in the same direction.  So that got me to thinking about an analogy that Joe gave in his sermon on Sunday, one that I really liked.  A lot of the time Christianity is labeled as exclusive because it holds that it is the only way; however, it's actually quite the opposite.  There are no requirements for becoming a Christian, no rules and regulations that you have to meet before you "meet the grade," nothing you had to do in a "past life," no out-of-body experiences you have to have to confirm your faith.  It's perfectly inclusive; all who come in genuine faith are accepted.  The analogy Joe gave was of the Browns having a game and the owner declaring that he was going to open Gate A (and only Gate A) and anyone who wanted to come could get in free of charge (imagine that the stadium didn't have a seating capacity).  But over at Gate C are a group of people waiting in line with money; when the usher comes over and points out that Gate C isn't going to open and that they can enter for free at Gate A, they refuse to enter through there because they want to get good seats and pay for them.  Even after the usher explains again to them that Gate C isn't going to open and access through Gate A is free, they continue to wait.  Who would claim that the Browns owner was being exclusive because he didn't open Gate C?
