"5, 6!" then we played 1 on 1, i got tired and he beat me 8-6, tho i made a funky layup over the back of the backboard. then cheryn tried to assail us for underground info on her teachers, then we washed up and met my brother in the LONG ASS line for pics. poor sophs. he didn't even ask his friends to cut, even though they were like 20 people behind him...alex: "screw your friends!"   said hi to heather, who tried to subvert the general serenity of the surroundings by cutting in plain view of da 5-0. but i made her see the light. natasha and jun came, then gayzel and sindy did too. me and alex went over to them, i talked to jocelynn, tyler, tammy and nicole, everyone thot their tennis tryouts were crap. like how girls always think they look ugly or fat when they're not. i reiterate, i'm glad to be a guy. joce had to take a shower cuz she had...carrot breath...the carrot munchies strike again. then we went inside and the freshies got their lockers (bottom lockers, puahahha) then they went out to the grass outside 300 wing. alex was talking about how nish didn't seem to like him, everytime nish saw a bunch of kids he'd smile, then he'd see alex and his smile would disappear. we told the freshies scary stories about lott and how he hates hosers. glad to be away from him. then me, alex, natasha, sindy and gayzel all decided to walk to hypernet and drop off jun (who went to see hot guys at bally's). hypernet, all the comps were filled, so we all just sat and talked and got off on kevin a's hair and watched him get awped like nobody's biznass. then me and alex played, i was murdered, except for this one time where i got 3 kills in a round, including the final kill on adam. woot.   we quit, natasha, sindy and gayzel were staring at some magazine, then adam joined us and we decided to walk to my house. people from spain are technically white, right? and what's up with the caucasian deal anyway? it's just an excuse to be asian. they didn't even come from caucasia...everyone knows michael jackson did...then we played life, fun fun, gayzel got no money from her 3 stock until she switched it with 9 then we spun hecka 3's, we rolled so many 4's (natasha's stock) that we had to trade in 10's for 100's. gayzel won with $2.375 M (only cuz she got the luxurious split-level haha), adam with $2.285 M (we had to add a bunch of money he hid), me with $2.035 M (i didn't cheat! i even forgot when people spun my stock), nastasha with $1.89 M, sindy with $1.415 M (and that beach-house where she could stare at hot guys from), and alex with $775,000 (he got crappy life tiles). then me and adam were brutalized by alex in timesplitters 2, then adam left, we stared at alex's pics (gayzel = o.O) and created a family. alex and gayzel are married, daughter: sindy. natasha is alex's little sister, and i'm married to her. small little family but it'll grow, i imagine. sindy can't have a brother cuz gayzel doesn't wanna go thru the "work" and alex wants her to be a loner. gayzel and sindy kept on slapping each other...child abuse...! then they got picked up, and alex left, and that's about it.
