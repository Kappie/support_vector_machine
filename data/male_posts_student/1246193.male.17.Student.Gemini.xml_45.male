I am ready for Scholastic Bowl to begin.  Mr. Daley said that we will start in a few weeks.  Taco Gringo is good!  I was supposed to go to St. Louis today.  Our troop was going to go to Cahokia Mounds and the Arch.  It would have been fun but alas, not enough people wanted to go so it was cancelled at the last minute.  I could have worked today had I known that we weren't going.  My mother took Belle to the vet this morning.  She had to have her nails trimmed.  I really don't have anything interesting to say so I shall leave it right here.
