I also added on to the little piano bit at the end, with some reverse guitar,organ recorder and the likes. No vocals, yet. I may make it longer in the future.  Now for some obligatory backround info. I litterally threw "Wizdeah" together for a friend's video game (which he rejected the original midi demo). So I took the song and made it better. The name was a rush of genious. Essentially me doing my "make up a word bit." This is a pretty complex process. A good word has a z in it. The "deah" is the double vowel combo that has too many pronounciations. It starts with a "W" which is the worst letter in the alphabet. And ends in "h" simply because.  Enjoy.
