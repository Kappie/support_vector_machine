I think there should be some sort of accountability in Hollywood regarding the amount of stress you can apply to your viewers in a given period of time. Were such standards set, I'm sure 24 would be in violation of them, no matter how lax they might be. Approximately 10 hours into the series we  finally  receieved our first pseudo-break in the tension. Bastards.
