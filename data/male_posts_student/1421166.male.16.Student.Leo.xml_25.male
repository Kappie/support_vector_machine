Shouldn't I be feeling peace. Maybe the fact that the next day is school and I haven't finished my homework bothers a bit too. But I only hope that I would have peace from the Lord, and I know that he's ready to give it to me. I just have to accept it.  Anyway, Friday was just a crazily busy day. With no free time at all, driving you till you have no energy. But the thought that it's Saturday the next day, and I'll be at YF is always refreshing. Saturday, I had band practice. And as usual, the fourth week in a row, I had make up lessons. So once again, (to my pleasure) I missed band practice again...hehe. Well, after that I went to Burger King to meet Corlissa and Yap Min, well, they were late, including Annabelle, whom I wasn't expecting. Then we went to Cold Storage to get the stuff for the progamme and for the refreshments, which turned out to be tons of chips. Well, at least we had mayo crabsticks on biscuits. I like the games during the workshop, although I already did them during the training, it was definitely different with so much more people. And there were new things to learn too. Although the Student Peer Group didn't talk much. As usual, the day ends with Captain's Ball followed by dinner at Heartland Mall. Today, I was to lead songs again(note:  just lead the day before at YF). But it's really nice to be a service to God. And I have to remember that I'm His unworthy servant too. I sang "You are so faithful" just now. It really brings back fond memories as well as sad ones. But I think I have to remind myself that I have chosen to let things go. I don't know what I'm suppose to mean by writing this here, but I hope the person who knows what I mean will not take it to heart. Sorry to that person. I guess even still, the song still has it's meaning. Thank God for being faithful. Anyway, I came homw to watch "Fellowship of the Ring" a second time today. It's really a touching great show. OK...gotta go and finish my work. Especially Chemistry, while Mr Wong still has good impression of me. Gotta be a Student for Christ!!!
