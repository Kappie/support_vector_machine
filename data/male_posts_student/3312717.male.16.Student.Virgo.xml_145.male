We had fun, etc, etc.  I'm home now, which I guess is all right. It is much hotter here than at my grandma's house.  Due to the heat, I am don't feel like blogging. Nonetheless, I shall perservere over it and continue.  I was driving today, and Chris made some off-hand remark about Bush. It made me think of the kids at my school, because it sounded just like something a Bush basher would say.   Man, I can't stand people who hate Bush to look cool, so they look like they care. It gives me a headache when people only argue that Bush is stupid. The ignorant scenesters should get the hell out of political activism, because they suck.  Inform yourself . Much of our strength resorts in our willingness to solve things in a civil and informed manner, without name-calling. If you are going to call Bush a greedy fascist, by all means, do so, but make sure you have the  facts  to back the names up. Otherwise, you just hurt us. Blind liberalism is just as bad as blind conservatism. Fact of the matter is, we aren't always right. No one is. We can't set prominent liberals on a pedestal and act like they have no flaws. Case in point: Michael Moore. I am not Rush Limbaugh, and you aren't Bill O'Reilly, so don't act like it, ok?  It goes  much  deeper than George Walker Bush, and all you have to do is look.  Caught up on Derby's blog a few minutes ago. He was talking about stuff he bought, and one thing struck me as particularly interesting. Wearing a Che Guevara T-Shirt to a high school: what a romantic notion. Now, that sounds incredibly sarcastic, I know, but it really is. Think about it: passively mocking all the kids, without them even knowing it!   Nothing screams, "I am a revolutionary," like wearing a shirt with Che's face on it, no doubt purchased from a mall.   I'm sorry, that was uncalled for.   But if you think about it, it is neither tired or cliche. Che's story no doubt mirrors our own. We start out as idealists, who are going to change the world. Some of us will be Fidel Castro, who stay behind in the (relative) safety of Cuba, and some of us will be Che, who will go to die in the jungle of Bolivia for what we believe in.   Who's going to run Cuba? Who will be gunned down by Bolivian Rangers?  Anyway, back to my original point: high school sucks really bad, and every day people passively rebel against it's depressing conformity. Derby, wearing a Che shirt. I don't want to mock  all  the people who attend BHS, because a lot of them are actually cool. However, majority of the people who go there are assholes who only care about getting drunk and following the latest trend. High school is basically training us not to think for ourselves at all. As long as you set the groundwork for social- and government- acceptable goals in high school, you're ok. Hell, if you pick on people who are different than everybody else, you're ok. High school is all about repressing the individual inside us, keeping us inside the comfortable and easily attainable goals our friends and relatives set for us.   Anyway, this is getting kind of long-winded and vague, so here goes: You can't buy rebellion from a mall, BHS sucks, and don't live your life according to the expectations of others.   Every day, someone new becomes disillusioned by their surroundings, and one more person is converted to the Revolution.
