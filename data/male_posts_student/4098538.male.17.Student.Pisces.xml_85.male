We played lots of pool and I discovered that I love malibu and coke! Mmmmmm yes! The bus ride home sucked 'cause it broke down for about half an hour and we were just sat there freezing our asses off. We got home really late... about an hour later than usual or something. But anyway.  After making Mandy some breakfast, I decided that I don't have the patience to look after tropical fish, so I bought 12 goldfish! They look soooo damn amazing, love 'em! Anyway I'm gonna go 'cause I'm going out for ma din-din's today!
