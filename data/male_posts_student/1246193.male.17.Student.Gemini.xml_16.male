Only a month and a half until I get my license, it seems like forever. I don't really know why I want a license-I won't be going anywhere.  I think it is simply the idea of being able to escape whenever I need to.    I often think about what goes through other peoples' heads. How they think, what they think, the way that people view the world around them, it all fascinates me. When you hear a song, what does it mean to other people?  When you view a piece of art, how do other people see it?  When something happens, how would other people have reacted to the situation?  Sure you can ask them, but you probably won't get a truthful answer.  Even if they are trying to tell the truth they can't describe how they think, exactly what went through their head.  I don't know maybe it is just part of my nosy nature, I just think about it a lot.  How can people do things without thinking about them.  I try to think about the consequences of my actions before I make them. I am not saying I have never blurted out something that I regret, I have many times, I just wonder about people. I believe that everyone views and interprets what is around them in a different way.  Where one person sees crap, the other sees beauty.  Two people may both see the same dilapidated, old building but one sees something that somebody should clean up, they other sees an opportunity to do good in the community. What about color? I see a color I know as red. You see a color you know as green. What if  they are the same color? Imagine if that is true, we would all have a completely different perspective of the world. I see dark, you see light. And who is to say it can't happen or it isn't true?          Maybe I think too much.  I just want people to see their enviroment from other perspectives. You see your life as a horrible existence, there has to be someone that has it worse than you, that wants your life.   Think before you speak.
