According to the NY Daily News, the Mets may pursue pitcher Miguel Batista:   Instead, the Mets have spoken multiple times with Miguel Batista's agent... it's likely he would fall within the Mets' price range. Batista - who writes poetry and kept a picture of Albert Einstein in his locker - is also the good-in-the-clubhouse type the Mets typically like.   I've read articles before that mentioned Batista being unusually learned for a baseball player, or something like that.  Actually, I'd like to read some of his poetry.  In the alternative, I can just make some up of my own:  Selections from "The Bad Haiku Journals of Major League Baseball Players"  (Pedro Martinez) Come closer, bald man Let me throw you to the ground And lose the Series  (Greg Maddux) Eleven long years And they've cut me loose like this Arbitration.  Sigh.  (Vladimir Guerrero) Offer me contract Someone, please, I'm really good! No, I really am!  (Jesse Orosco) I've found the secret Of playing ball forever One fastball a week  (Curt Schilling) I don't want a trade How I love my no-trade clause Oh please please trade me  (Mo Vaughn) A baseball is round I am pretty much round too I eat round baseballs
