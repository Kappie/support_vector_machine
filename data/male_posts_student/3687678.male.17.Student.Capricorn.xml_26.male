What is nice about Mozilla browsers compared to Internet Explorer is that a fix will be released soon. Microsoft usually knows about a flaw for awhile before releasing a fix. Mozilla has a large community of developers that tries to fix any bugs or flaws right away.   urlLink View Official Bug Report   urlLink View Secunia.com Report
