I sought solace in the wilderness, I sought for gold there, I found only vast plains, Of nothingness, Bearing many tears and wounds, I now seek the true road.   Is every equation balanced? Must there be insufficiency, To compensate for every talent? If so, A great gift, Carries a deadly curse.  In the dark valleys, Will I ever find a rose? Will I find it before it wilts, Or before I do so?   Written by Yours Truly. (In case you think I copied it.)
