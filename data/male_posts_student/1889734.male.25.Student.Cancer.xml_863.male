I'm thinking it's going to be over on Saturday in Calgary.  After all, how long can the Lightning play .500 hockey?  They've been getting away with that for too long.  Great game last night.  Iginla is simply amazing.  I am seriously getting flashes of Gretzky from him - not to say he will BE a Gretzky, but the way he can hold the puck in traffic reminds me of Wayne.  Several times he just appeared in the right place at the right time, or held the puck long beyond the point where any normal person should maintain possession.  That translates into scoring chances.  Great hockey in the finals.  No one is really screwing up, and both teams are working hard for goals.  Too bad no one really cares, as they are all waiting in breathless anticipation for the start of the NBA finals.  Bah!
