Yes, I was born and raised in suburbia. I'm not complaining, but I'm not exactly thrilled about it, either. Wanna be spooky kid? Not really. My room is bright green and blue. I don't wear any clothing that would make a "wanna be spooky kid". Actually, I dress quite average.  I am ridiculed, but only by you.  I'm not looking for a group of people to pat my head and tell me it's all ok. I continue to write on here because they ask me to.  I will "stop wasting my time and move on". Yes, I am saddened by some recent events, but I also realize that in time, that will pass, and I will go on to lead a full and happy life. If you've never been sad in your life, then I would venture to say you have no emotion. By the way, although I only seem to put my sad thoughts on here, They aren't the only thoughts I have. Most days, I usually do feel some happiness throughout the day.  I don't whore my poetry. Again, it's there because I've been asked to put it up. I've taken it down many times, and have always been asked by many people to put it back up.  And so. I'm not gothic. I'm not a punk. I'm not depressed. I may whine a little, but that's simply because I find it easier to write about the sad than the happy.  P.S.  I have no intention of making your life hard.
