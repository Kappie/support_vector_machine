Still no job bites but they will come, so I am not to worried about it at the moment. I finally got my DSL connection up and running so I am stoked about that. Should make the job hunt a little quicker. I was getting kicked off every 10 minutes or so from this dial-up shit.  I have three computers I need to fix up for mimi's dad by friday. We are going back out to lodi to wash some clothes and return our new puppy back to the real owners. Our lost little welsh corgie ran away from home, mimi's dad found her and mimi brought her here. Now the 'real' owners put an ad in the paper looking for their lost dog. Her name is Minnie Mouse and she belongs to a little 4 year old girl. awwwwwwww. I will miss the sweet pup.   I need to keep this up to date.   current mood: busy current music: mazzy star
