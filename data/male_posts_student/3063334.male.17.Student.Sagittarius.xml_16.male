Jim, as a slave, probably has a really low self-esteem and he comes from the world where slaves have to listen to whites for every little nuts and bolts. Of course Jim did not know he was free, (any slave would think it's a miracle if somebody proclaimed they were free). So he just thought "this is the way everything is done, because Tom said so".  Even though he has the brain to mention it's a ridiculous idea like making up a coat of arm, but he still follows the order, because who knows what will happen to him if a slave doesnt obey a white man's order.  But I understand where you come from. I also felt very weird these things were happening, but lots of weird things happen back then, a lot of things today would consider very very sick and unbearble......So in trusting Twain's realism style of writing, I have to just interpret what I can about the society from Twain's words.
