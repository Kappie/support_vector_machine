The remake is amazing, and what people are saying about the original makes me want to see it all the more.    Of course this movie brings up some interesting conspiracy theories, the least of which being those theories which claim our own government carried out experiments into the ring of the paranormal. Whether or not we did make such strides into the fields of hypnotism and brainwashing, such theories--and now movies--clearly bring up the question of the morality of such actions.  Conspiracy theorists are quick to point an accusing finger at the government regarding these issues, but if one must first ask  why  they believe in right or wrong before they question another's methods and motives.  As we determined with the last post, the ends do not always justify the means. Even though the survival of an individual or a species may seem noble enough, survival of one oftentimes signals the trampling of the rights of others. Sort of a "this town ain't big enough for the two of us" mentality is often  reality .  So does that mean that the goal of survival, a trait of many living things, is an evil attribute of mankind?  Well what is evil?  In the movie last night, which I will try to relate to without issuing too many spoilers, you'd think that Raymond Shaw's (Liev Schreiber) mother (Meryl Streep) would eventually realize that the actions she is sponsoring are twisted and evil;  bad science . Yet her and many  real  people do just such things that are frowned upon by the general population.  So is good and bad a constant, across all humanity, or is it relative, changing based on the current situation of each individual?  I tend to believe, based on my faith, that morality is a constant, the same standard for everyone.  And if this is the case, as I so believe, it is imperative for those who respect common morality to fight for and defend the life, liberty, and happiness of those who might be having their rights impeded by those who do not respect morals.
