It is only my second day with retainers but I might as well be mute - Ms Lee says that I "talk too softly" and Dong accusingly said something on the line of me being insolent.  The week in general has been rainy. Raindrops HAVE been falling on my head in great volume - not the watery kind that gifts you the common cold, but more of the mental kind. The kind that takes its form in bad things that happen.  I think the greatest woe I have had this week is the thought of struggling through my retainers. It's been sickening. I just don't want to think about it, but it's difficult to forget that it's the contraption that is almost choking you in the mouth every day.  Mind block.  I will be back. I promise.
