Hmm..what happened was that Lillian won Immunity and had to choose between Jon and Sandra. Now, if she chose Jon, she would have won easily(it was proven correct when during the Reunion, the Jury said they would vote Lil to win if she took Jon along). But no. She chose Sandra, because Sandra, like Lil, is a wife who has to support her family. That's a choice of integirty, but however, it costs Lil US900k. Hmm...Sandra won by 6-1 vote (the extra vote was Tijuana's). Hmm...actually. I don't mind who won who lost. As long as my predicted cat won can liao. HeHe. I am so looking out for All-Stars Survivor! Woo-hoo! Rupert and Shii Ann is appearing again! Yay! Can't wait!!  Hmm...today leh, I carried a whole hell of a lot of things into my house. First, me and Wendy carried her Christmas tree to my house at 1something. That tree was to be tansported into the chalet, with courtesy of my father.   After tree transportation, me and Wendy went to meet Gloria at the 911 busstop. Wendy is going to Causeway Point, while me and Gloria are going to play basketball.      Hmm, we went there and met CQ, Joyce, PY and Hann. Soon, XC and WQ joined us at the basketball court. We travelled long and far to search for a empty (or at least, half-empty) basketball court to play in. We found one near the Woodgrove thingy (and where Amanda stays) and started playing.  HaHa. We played only for a short while until we complained it was too hot. Me and XC went to Woodgrove's NTUC to buy drinks for everybody. HaHa! We walked back, took some gulps of drinks and continued playing. This time, we played full court. Run here, run there and soon, after 6 minutes, everybody is tired and we rested. After that, we continued playing until it rains.   We ran to Choy Kee in Woodgrove. Hann and XC ate chicken rice there. Then, we went to NTUC for a short while. We took the 912 to Woodlands Interchange. Hmm...in the end, only me, XC and WQ went to Causeway Point.   We went to the library first to return WQ's books. Then, we walked around Causeway Point, shopping for clothes and handphones. All for XC la. HaHa. At 5 something, endy smsed, saying she arrived. We hurried down to the bus interchange to meet Wendy and gang.  They went to Sheng Shiong and brought chalet stuff. Wendy, Sonia and MeiYing. HaHa. I am helping them to trasnport ma, so they brought to my house. Only Wendy and Sonia followed me to my house. Woah! Got so many things wor. Charcoals ar, grill mesh, drinks bottles (we are talking about giant size here..haha), the works. HaHa. I had a real tough time carrying the items wor! HaHa. We made it...and I heard there are more coming on Sunday.  Hmm...what else today? I ate dinner with grapes, watched TV shows till 9pm and came online lor.  Wha!! I am so scared leh! Tomorrow is the posting results of the PAE. I got this dreadful feeling that I will end up in Arts Stream, since I don't exactly qualify for Science stream (I failed A-Maths ma). That's why. My dreadful feelings always come true one, that's why it is so dreadful. I think I am gonna appeal if I get into Arts Stream. Yeah. I think can appeal one la. I only failed by 6 marks, not like I failed so terribly like that. I made careless mistakes, not like I don't know my work. Besides, my Chem and Bio results are great. I am kinda worried about my B3 for Combined Science, but I think I can scrape through if I present my wonderful Chem results. All Physics' fault! HaHa. Sigh...worried worried worried la.  Okay. I think I end le. See ya tomorrow, with hopefully good news. Night blog!
