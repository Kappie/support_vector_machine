He led one of the best times that our economy ever had, handled war with ease, and negotiated for American hostages like it was a walk in the park. He gave a stunning and moving speech to the survivors of D-Day and was just a guy that you really could relate to. The fact that he had alzheimers makes his death seem even more sadder. So, here's to the number one President of the United States of America. Here's to Ronald Reagan! *clink*  http://apnews.myway.com/image/20040607/RONALD_REAGAN.sff_CACC101_20040607145156.html?date=20040607=D832BKSO0
