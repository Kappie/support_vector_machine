Anyway, I plan to post my goings-on in here (is that gramatical?) for the summer, and maybe even beyond that.  Just to update what's been going on in my life: The job hunt continues, though not as vigorously as before... I figure I'm gonna be gone much of the summer (see below), so a job isn't as much of a priority as before. But still, employers: COME ON! Why won't you hire me (Tower Records, I'm looking in your direction... really, I literally am).  Looks like I'm gonna be gone July 8-20 on vacation. I'm going to Seattle for some sort of family reunion. Then the family's planning to go on a road trip and hit Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Rocky Mountain, Arches, and Canyonlands National Parks. In addition, we'll probably visit Salt Lake City, Denver, and Idaho. Wow, I'm excited about this trip, though I hope that summer crowds don't get in the way. Exchange trip! We're leaving in 43 days (if I counted correctly)! Whoa I'm excited to go to Germany. Ich bin noch nicht zu Europa gewesen, so I'm super-excited about this. Then they're coming here in September! Whoa, that's gonna be great! I still have to buy my summer reading books. And I only have 4 weeks to read them! Whew, too much excitement in store for me! OMG there's more!  I Love the 90s  premieres July 12 on VH1! AAAAH I need to go back to my dull existence as a summertime student... I think I'll sleep.
