I think they forgot it.  This is the worst thing that has ever happened to the history of Bingo.  So I'm going to keep this short.  You get four cards in Go Bingo.  Wow.  How amazing.  You can play for iCoins, which is probably the only perk in this game.  You win, you get iCoins.  Plain and simple.  But, that's all that's good about this.  It is, truly, a horrid, horrid game.  I'm not even going to continue.  It's saddening to talk about it.   Pros  +Play for iCoins    Cons  -Everything but the one pro.    Score  Fun Factor: 30%-F Graphics/Layout: 70%-C Speed: 80% Customization/Controls: 20% Final: 50%-F.
