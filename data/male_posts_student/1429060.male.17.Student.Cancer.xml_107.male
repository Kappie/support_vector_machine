Ugh. Devilish essays about personal material. Blegh.  I talked to Whitney Adsit today before/after the bio exam. Apparently her horse, Ferris, will be out of commission for some time, as it tore a hunk of ligament from the back of its leg. I promised Whitney I would visit Ferris sometime this year; I plan to stick to that promise, even if that demands visiting her the day I receive my driving privelages back. I want to see Miss Adsit again. She is so lovely.  Two weeks 'til school closes up, yo. I'm feeling senioritis already. Let me out of this prison, I want to start my internship.
