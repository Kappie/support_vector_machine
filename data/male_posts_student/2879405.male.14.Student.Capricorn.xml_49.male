Well, Mr. Leong mentioned many things about our discipline, our behaviour as a Marist. It actually took up half of our entire Precious PE lesson time, which we were all looking forward to, playing soccer of course. The bad thing was, we only had around 15 minutes left to complete our soccer match. We drew with the better team formed in this 2 classes, and both teams, were treated like losers when we stepped out of the Multi-Purpose-Court Gates. So, the game ended, we were preparing to return when something horribly disgusting happened. I walked up the stairs of the GrandStand. Only half my foot was anchored to the next step, and fell. I put my right foot forward, and as a fast walker, my next foot was already up. My left shin had just hit the wooden seats of the GrandStand. Initially, I thought to be some minor injury, perhaps carrying bruises or minor cuts around the school. But who would have thought that about 0.5cmÂ³ of flesh was peeled off, with the shocking shock i got, it didn't seem as serious as anybody would have thought to be. With a white thing protruding out of the flat surface, it was thought to be a broken bone. But the truth behind that was, the fat came out. Being an athelete, its natural that our legs are stronger, if not my shin would have been gone. I was being carried up by Ka Wai and Mr. Leong, 2 stories, it wasn't easy as you think, I'm 50kg for goodness sake. I almost felt like sleeping when so much blood, the sudden gush of red liquid flowing out slowly. It dampened my white socks, which is as good as being thrown away. As i sat at the bench outside the general office, i thought about 1 thing in life : All you need is 1 step, you miss it, you fall, probably to your death. And Mr.Leong must have been joking about the need of being hospitalised. Shortly after being laid on the bench, Mr.Suresh, came running to my aid, with his medicine box, like how he always used to treat the other students. Well, there were indeed signs of concern. But when he said Oh shit, what is this man...I really thought over the seriousness of this fall. He got some water, probably clean water, together with a piece of cotton wool, to clean up the blood stains on my then handicapped leg. Nothing in my life could be worse than the situation I was in, the unknown situation of the injury. And Mr. Dennis Koh came shortly after receiving the news, bringing some hot water to treat the initial shock. After all that, he questioned me :" Guess what will happen in the year 2006." I replied saying I will be secondary 4 then. EH TO BE CONTINUED I GOT NO TIME NOW 2MORW THAN WRITE BB
