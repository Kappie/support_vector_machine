Drowning in Mercury is a complete product, at least.. untill I can figure out what else I can do to it  FYE is an incomplete recording of a song I wrote back in High School... now that I have the equipment, I can record and play around with it. I must say, it's very different to how I originally intended it to be - the big heavy metal solos have disappeared, and there's an element of Jazz/Blues that's appearing there. Considering that I don't like Jazz or Blues that much, it's rather weird.  It's about halfway finished so far, and the MP3 conversion lessened the quality somewhat, unfortunately
