It strangles me, these lies, blinding me; I can't breathe, I'm staggering towards you. But your far, much farther now.  That is my reason to leave; Your making me deceased.  I have endured, I have kept myself going on. But your there; Never here.  Your lies, I have forgiven. The pain you've cause, I have forsaken. I took you in, again and again.  My choice has been made, I can't let you do this anymore.  You've blinded me from the truth, you've made me lost in a world so untrue. Yet you've trapped me there, afflicted by your addiction.  I've tried repeatedly to come back to you, but only inflicting myself with pain and sorrow. Why do you keep me locked out; Why are you so far away.  I have to move on, I can't carry on this way. This is my reason; Your making me deceased.
