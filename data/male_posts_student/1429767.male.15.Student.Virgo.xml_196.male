Even with the newest drivers I have even more problems. For one, with the new drivers, I can't even really do anything with my computer unless it's in safe mode, it keeps crashing and eventually VPU recover can't bring it back out of dead lock. How fun? Then with the old drivers at least I can use my computer I just can't play Unreal Tournament 2004 or I get the XP blue screen of death! NOOOO! I HATE that screen! I'm going to have to e-mail ATI tonight and see what they say about it, maybe I'll get a new video card out of the deal! ;)
