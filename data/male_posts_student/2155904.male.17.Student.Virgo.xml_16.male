HE ALWAYS FEELS SORRY FOR HIMSELF!!!  Damn that sucks.  First off on the way home to Purdy's house from the football game Tyke, Skippy, Purdy, Macaroon, Tyronius, and Mandy all decided that Tyke is the most pathetic but also that he and Tina should be voted Couple That Should Have Been in the yearbook at the end of the year.  But then after Tyke dropped everyone but Skippy and Mandy off Tyke found out another interesting fact that is very true.  When he and Skippy asked Mandy why they didn't have girlfriends she said it was because they are too nice.  Finally, Tyke learns that this really is the truth.  He always thought this but no girl really told him so.  So thank you Mandy, this made Tyke feel worse and better at the same time.  But it really is true.  The guys are too nice to be boyfriends.  They are better had as friends.  And as upsetting as this may be to the boys, at least it is better than being an arse that nobody likes :/.  Eh, another sad night.  The sad thing is that Tyke almost wishes the reason that he didn't have a girl that liked him was because he was like ugly or skinny or something that he was just born with.  But his being a great guy is something that he could but wouldn't want to change.  He probably couldn't even be meaner if he tried.  He doesn't like that.  He just wishes that he found a girl that liked him for who he is, a genuine, nice, fun guy.  Is she out there?  (If so what is her name and phone number?)  Where are you dream girl?  Oh and by the way, Tyke is just seeing no future with Tina which is making him think that he might as well just flat out give up and find something else to do.  She isn't gonna come around and he knows so.  This would mean that he is on the search for a new girl-although he still has very strong feelings for Tina but he is going to try and submerge those.
