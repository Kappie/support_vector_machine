       
      I was searching through some quotes just now and found  "To live without loving is not really to live." - Moliere  and I thought Oh no, is it possible I've read that one before and thats where i got my short:  Living life without loving is less than living  from?  I hope not... I don't remember ever reading that quote before but theyre so similar...  Anyway, i should probably go finnish bio, but chances are i'll put it off a little longer.
