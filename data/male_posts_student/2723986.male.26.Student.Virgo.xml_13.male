FULL NAME: Joshua Luke Kramer (note: Star Wars was released in ’77, same year I was born in.  Now look at my middle name.  One day I hope to find out the real truth about this) 2. BIRTHDAY AND AGE: September 3, 1977 - 26 years old 3. WHERE DO YOU LIVE?: Camas, Washington USA 4. DO YOU HAVE A BOY/GIRLFRIEND: Yep, for going on 6 years 5. WHAT FAMOUS PERSON DO PEOPLE THINK U LOOK LIKE?:  In Japan I got Tom Cruise a lot.  Even Brad Pitt.  Both those are off.  Someone said I looked like a mix between Richard Gear and Tom Cruise.  That’s probably the closest I’ve heard. 6. WHAT OR WHO ARE YOU AFRAID OF?: Very high places with no guard rails, deep water (like a few miles off shore), preying mantis, anything that is pissed at me and has sharp teeth (or a serrated beak). 7. DO YOU WEAR CONTACTS OR GLASSES?: I just recently had to get glasses, though I only need them to see small details at long distances.  I hardly wear ‘em. 8. WHAT'S YOUR PERSONALITY TYPE?: Laid back, funny, confident, sometimes aloof to others unintentionally.   9. DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ATTRACTIVE?: Yes, I get a good amount of girlie attention.  Must be the curly locks and muscles. 10. YOUR MOST EMBARRASSING MOMENT: Well, in 7th grade had to go to the bathroom so bad I pissed my pants while playing center field.  Actually, nobody ever found out because it dried by the time I got back to the dugout.  I then acted like I was splashing water on myself because of the heat to wash it out.  Nobody knew what happened, so I guess that’s more of a POTENTIALLY most embarrassing moment.  Guess the cat’s out of the bag know though… 11.YOUR FAVOURITE FOOD: Chicken and rice bento, cucumbers, pears, chocolate Myoplex, black licorice. 12. DESSERT: Again, black licorice.  Any kind of sherbet 13. GUM: I don’t chew gum 14. BEVERAGE: Gatorade, lemonade 15. MOVIES: Billy Madison, Lost in Translation, LotR Trilogy, just about any Toho Godzilla movie. 16. TV SHOW: TV sucks unless it’s sports 17. CHANNEL LINE UP: See above.  ESPN. 18. SEASON: Tie: Winter and Summer.  I love the snow and I love the sun.  Probably Summer by a hair though… 19. CLOTHING STORE: Uniqlo, a GAP-like store in Japan with super cool clothes for super low prices. 20. PLACE TO VISIT: U.K., Germany, Australia and back to Japan baby! 21. SALAD DRESSING: Pretty much anything, preferably low fat 22. DO YOU WANT A CAREER OR A FAMILY: Yeah, eventually.  Both seem to be coming along at the moment 23. WHERE YOU GOING TO LIVE: I like the NW, but living abroad would be nice.  Living back in Japan would be awesome! 24. EVER GOING TO GET MARRIED? Yup 26. ARE YOU GOING TO COLLEGE? Yeah, for the past seven years now.  Maybe I’ll make a career out of it somehow… 27. LOVED SOMEBODY SO MUCH IT MAKES YOU CRY? No.  Well…ok, yeah.  So what’s it to ya! 28. SMOKED: Cigarettes, no.  Ganja, quite a few times just after High School.  My friends and I had some hilarious times smoking it, though I haven’t touched the stuff in about six years. 29. BROKEN THE LAW?: Heh.  This could be a long answer.  Here are a few highlights: some friends and I burned down our rival high school’s sign, threw a cinder block out of a moving vehicle at parked police car (I didn’t do the actual throwing), stole a handicap parking sign and 100-club plaque from Shari’s restaurant along with a bunch of other signs. 30. BROKEN A BONE?: Not really, just hairline fractured by ankle when I was young.  It’s completely healed now though. 31. CHEATED ON A TEST?: Never.  I trust myself more than some other person. 32. SKINNY DIPPED?: No 33. PLAYED STRIP POKER?: No, just regular old poker 34. PLAYED TRUTH OR DARE: Yeah, a long time ago.  I got to feel boobies, nothing too out of control. 35.

ALTERNATIVE?: Some. 47. HEAVY METAL?: Rarely 48. CLASSICAL?: Yeah, though it really just depends on what it is 49. OLDIES?: Some 50. SOAP OPERAS?: What the hell? 51.
