Mr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a message for her. Might remain. What?   I.   Some flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide comes here a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and letters. O, those transparent! Besides they don't know. What is the meaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not like.   AM. A.   No room. Let it go.  Mr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand. Nothing grows in it. All fades.
