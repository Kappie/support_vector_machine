We didn't go anywhere like we normally do since tonight we are going to see the second musical that we have tickets to,  The King and I .  Since Saturday evening, I have been downloading episodes from two of my favorite comedies on Fox. The first one,  urlLink  Quintuplets  , just premiered a few weeks ago, but has already become one of the shows that I try to watch every week. The other show,  urlLink  Arrested Development  , has completed its first season and is going to start its second in the fall. Both of these shows are part of Fox's LOL Sunday lineup, so it makes them easy to watch along with  Malcolm .
