Today I was actually writing a post about improving transportation problems in the world but I was sidetracked, by a rabid, menopausal, bitch of a mother who is on my case because I do not have a job. Whenever the economy is doing poorly it seems like it's my fault I can never find work. My resume is decent, I have a high-school  urlLink diploma  and a college  urlLink diploma  and two years of  urlLink university  on paper.  Finding a job is easy- I could work in any fast food joint instantly, or some miserable telemarketing job, so I try to hold out, I try to apply to different jobs, but because of insane pressure from two unstable adults who try to exert control over me as much as they can, I end up getting some ridiculous job that ends up making me unhappy.  Do they care?  No, I've learnt that no matter what I do they benefit in the long run-- and the only reason they are placing pressure on me is because they are miserable unreasonable people.  I can't take this nonsense from them anymore, it makes me unproductive, and I lose focus. I am going to keep applying and hopefully I manage to find a good job.  wish me luck
