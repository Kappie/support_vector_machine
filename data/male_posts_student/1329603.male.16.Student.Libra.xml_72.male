We haven't been on at the same times... waah....  I saw Rosie this morning. She was disturbed about me keeping on looking at her, as I believe I would be were I her. If a 16 year old kept on looking at you when you were in Y8 I think you'd be nervous too. It's just... wrong. I glanced over to Lizzie on ocassions but she didn't notice, thankfully. I DID notice the constant stares from Beccay, disturbingly enough. Something unusual was the quick, warm glances from a 2nd violin in front of me...  ^^  Actually, reread my blog so far, and it's all been about girls I either have expressed that I do or do not fancy. Well, I didn't express it about Zoe, not in so many words. Argh, I'm a teenager, and I'm not keen on the whole idea.  Wanting to go down and kind of put one arm around Miller and use the hand attached to the other arm to play with Jasmin's hair. Hohum.  Mel and Kirsty at SS could do I Know Him So Well, thinking about it. Yeah, they could do that. Either that or Mel and Gwen. It's just I want 2 people to do it... OOH Sally and Rachel. But Rachel seems to think I either hate her or fancy her and Sally is getting annoyed, it would seem, at how blatantly I stare at her ocassionally. So it comes back to Mel and someone else. Gwen and Suz? Scott and Mel? Scott can do falsetto... Curtis and Scott?  *whistles to try to stop self from going downstairs and talking to Miller*...  Quote of the day: "J'ai guru deva om.
