When I got to about the 4th track, my CD player began to speed up the playback and I had to turn it off and back on.  Kind of weird.  Maybe I'll call tech support about it.  Or I probably won't.  Anywas, I listened to the whole CD and then a few tracks over again.  I really like that CD.  Makes me want to buy more Coldplay stuff, but most of it is not available in stores.  You have to buy it online and most of it is imported so that makes it twice the price.  They only have one full length album and so everything else is EPs with about 3 or so tracks.  Kind of annoying.  It may just be the sheets on my bed, but lately I can't sleep.  It's not that there's a lot going on.  I'm not in any sports of any sort this term.  Generally when you try to go to sleep, you just wonder about thinking about anything at all, but I always think about the same thing.  I can never fall asleep thinking about it either.  Maybe I'll change my sheets and see how that works.
