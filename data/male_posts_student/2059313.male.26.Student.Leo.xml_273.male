Now the first thing that comes to my mind isn't, "Gee, what an aweful smell".  No, the first thing that pops into my head is that a friend of mine told me that they actually liked the smell of skunks.  I'll always think of you, friend, when I smell skunk while travelling down the road.  God love ya'.
