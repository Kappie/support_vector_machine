I found out the only final I really have to study for is English. And I have to study my butt off to keep an A. But after school I walked home and then KLT came over and we studied math. Well really didn't study because we didn't get anything done. Her cookies were good though. Then I just got online. That was my day! Finals are gonna suck! But hopefully i'm good at it. Well sleep time. Later
