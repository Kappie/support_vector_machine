However, I have been thinking about my social life, and come to a good, firm conclusion that it is, in fact... non-existent. I've worked out I probably go out with my friends about once every 3 or 4 months. Yes, it is that bad. Dickybod goes out to some sort of youth club once a week (I think) and so do some of my other friends. I don't think megatrobe goes out very often, and nonnesuch doesn't either. Probably more than I do though. I came to be thinking about my situation after I declined the offer from a few boys at school in my science classes to go to a party, being held at some stranger's (to me)house, probably more than 5 miles away. The offer was initially given to nonnesuch, who not-so-politely declined, and as I managed to get involved, they invited me to. As I already said, I declined the offer, mainly because I was under the impression there would be loud music, alcohol, smoking and... other strange stuff that is totally alien to my life. My impression was correct. I was given a brief description of the party today at school, and it definitely didn't sound like the sort of place I belong. I was sort-of glad I refused the offer, although should I have? I do need a social life, and I wasn't doing anything of interest that evening (watching the Eurovision wasn't interesting). But music? Alcohol? Smoking? Probably best I didn't go, as that would have been a sign of giving in to peer pressure. Which  IS  a bad thing. Yes, probably best I didn't go...  In other news, I have a German oral exam on Wednesday. So I should be panicking, but I'm not. I'm not feeling to bad about it actually.   And I shall replace the 'playing' title with 'reading' in my signiture, as I rarely 'play' games.   Reading:  Interesting Times  Listening to:  Prince Ali!
