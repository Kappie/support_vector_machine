I've been listening to some old school punk (Adolescents, Dead Kennedys, etc.),  Me First and the Gimme Gimmes , and  Dropkick Murphys .  I had a dream about Ultima 8. Yes I'm that much of a computer nerd... or at least I used to be.  I have work from 3-9 PM... and I need to go grocery shopping for tomorrow.  Not sure why, but whenever I chat with Laine these days... it's been fun making fun of her.  ***
