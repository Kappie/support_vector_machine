Belated Happy Birthday din!)  it is, as always, fun to receive messages, calls, email from people wishing me a happy birthday...  however, unlike my previous birthdays, I am not actually happy that it is my birthday...  for one, even if I want to celebrate it today...I cannot...not because I already went out yesterday but simply because I have school work to do...which I already enumerated last post...  Hmmm...I can not finish my Lit paper, I do not know why but I find it hard continuing it...siguro because it is my birthday...after all...  there are also things I am looking forward to this week (my birthday week)...  1. a lunch date with my good old monster friend...  2. a long test in math (not actually anticipated...its more of dreaded)  3. nice comments from Joseph Salazar about our photo essay, it may noy be as good as Anna-Val-Omi's group but at least its nice...  4. a nice decent class standing in ECE 21...  there...  I might post later...I just might...
