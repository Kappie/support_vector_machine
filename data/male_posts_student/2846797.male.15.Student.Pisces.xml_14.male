I'm like 97% sure I didn't do it but if I did it wont be more then a sentence or two that I did subconsisously. But they way are teachers are going they make it sound like 4/5 people did it so everyone is on edge. Anyways got my old computer and got it running. This weekend it's getting a new case with a window and network card. After that I plan on saving for a 32MB card for then installing Sues Linux on it. I will only use it for graphics so ya. Well I guess that's it. Bye.
