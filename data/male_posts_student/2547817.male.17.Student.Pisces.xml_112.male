They performed for me and we played on the monkey bars. I love the people of my past.  I have to talk to her tomorrow to explain things that she already knows. I'm not even sure if I understand. Or should I just call her now? I close my eyes and sigh like I've been doing all day long. I've been cut again. Hurray! Why don't you smile there friend. Why don't you sit there, in your comfy little chair, and bloody smile. You like this don't you?
