You brought me light where I was alone.   ((chorus))  You take my hand, and I know no sorrow. You give me faith to rise high above every storm  I was so lost, but you pulled me through. You held me close, and I hurt no more.  (( chorus ))  Ooo.... Oooo... Oooo... You came to me when all turned away. You gave me hope  and I knew I'd live through the storm.  (( chorus ))
