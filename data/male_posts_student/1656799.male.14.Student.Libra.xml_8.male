Looking around me I can see a hell of a mess in my room, from my chair I can spy some Belgian chocolates which were bestowed upon me as a present on Christmas Day. I'm unsure whether to eat these or not now, I'm not sure if they'll taste horrid, and I'm going to feel guilty as I would waste them otherwise. If anyone knows what I can do with them then answers on the back of a postcard please.  Woke up at 8am again today, leaving me little time to get myself ready and leg it out of the house. Much to my annoyance, the gate that allows entrance to New College was locked  again , so after furiously muttering 'naughty sweary shit' under my breath, I walked around the building, thus making me a good five minutes late to school.  Maths really for me won the 'whaaaaa?' award for the day, or we could say the fortnight. After some really easy work in the past two weeks, we were given bitches of questions and work to do, and to add more insult to the injury, I had only woken up an hour before and was being watched by Mr Runham.   "Right Kev, what's 4 cubed?" *cogs in brain currently not running ... pause ... dirt becomes untrapped in cogs* "64 sir."   Finding myself rather pleased to be out of the lesson when the bell went, I rushed off to my tutorial lesson, only to spend ten minutes of it outside my tutor class talking to Rebecca and Jessica. Finally went into my tutor class, to have my digital camers inspected by Mr Maher, whilst I ate a cucumber and tomato sandwich. Yes, I know Rebecca, please don't go on about sandwiches.  The next lesson was Art, one that I always dread on a Thursday and daydream of getting out. Take three objects and draw them, and the background. Do outline for this lesson, and then next lesson work on getting one and a half sections complete, and on the third week complete it.  I know I'm definitely not an arty person when it comes to me and a pencil, especially observational drawings. I find no satisfaction in drawing an old violin, jug and a purple cup. Oh wait, Rebecca doesn't like that purple cup, lets change it for a doll! Heh, I can't draw, and changing the cup for a doll made it all the worse, I protested.   "But I don't like that doll, change it please!"  I claimed, hoping that out of Rebecca's heart she'll agree and choose something simple to replace it.  "No, I want to draw it,"  she replied rather menacingly, and that was it really. I gave up all protest and just put up with it and drew what I could.  By the end of the lesson all I managed to draw was half the violin and a wonky jug, nevermind the doll, I wasn't going to bother with that for a while.  Scurrying quickly out of my art classroom I took the usual journey of going down the stairs and heading for the far playground where I usually spend my break. Unfortunately I couldn't remember anything interesting from break, just making sure that I remembered how to breathe and digest food.  After break I left to go to my DT lesson, in which I did nothing ... again. Its starting to annoy me that I do nothing in my DT lesson, after all teachers are paid to teach students, and not for us to just waste their time. The discussions during DT had varied a lot, from penis piercings to well, boyfriends and girlfriends; something that I lack excess knowledge of. I shut up for most of the lesson and as soon as the bell went, walked to my english lesson.  On the way to my english lesson a year 9, who is probsbly less educated than a braindead goldfish did something so stupid that she could of seriously hurt someone. She waited behind a door of a busy corridor, and when someone went to open the door, viciously kicked it sending the door straight into the person's face. Now, I am not making a rant out of this just because the two people it happened to happen to be my best friend and my friend, but because of the fact that in year 7 we have a brittle-boned student who is barely 4 feet tall. The corridor was full at the time, so he wouldn't of been noticable at all. Had he been there, and he had been knocked back by someone who was knocked back or hit in the face by the door itself, he would have been seriously injured. I considered hurling abuse to the person who did this, but I decided not to in the end as I felt it would of added more fuel to the fire and I would just be stooping down to their level.  I didn't do much work in my english lesson, until the last fifteen minutes where I quickly noted down an opening paragraph to a short story I may write in the near future. Rebecca said to me that it was 'all pwetty', so I explained to her that this is only how it will seem, but once read will change your opinion ... slightly.  Lunch past quickly as well to my disappointment, so I have nothing to say about it. I went off to Science quickly and remembered that I took no pictures during the break, bugger.  Science had continued its trend of being dull and boring, no matter what experiments or 'exciting things' we do. Brushing up on how to use a microscope didn't exactly interest me, so I just watched as Rebecca plucked hairs from Tricia's head, although in turn I did get hairs pulled from mine.  Refused to go home without a hug from Rebecca, and in the end, managed to get two. Muahahaha.  The New College gate was still locked, so once again I had to go the long way to get home, which caused me to arrive home about ten minutes later than usual.  The day after school has not been very interesting for me, I must of spent so far about fifteen minutes decided what to write and not what to write here, was thinking of avoiding the rant about the door incident, and then felt it had to be included.  I know this is a pretty long entry so far, but I'm going to give you guys a little treat, have some links that I've found in the past week.   urlLink Hey Hey 16K   I'm jumping on this bandwagon a bit too late here, its been around for about two weeks now and I've only just decided to blog it. Hey Hey 16K is a song composed by DJ Hibbett and animated by B3ta's very own Rob Manuel. The song is about the consoles before 16K had become popular. Oh how I wish I could play Jetpac...   urlLink La Haine - Â£15 On Play   I've heard very good words about this french film, so this will have to be one of my next purchases. To save myself some time, I'll put up its description from Play.com, and I'll have you know that the guy who directed this also directed Gothika.   La Haine is packed with sharp street humour, intense action and brutally brilliant camera work.   Police viciously beat a 16-year-old housing estate kid they are questioning, leaving him almost dead. Responding to violence, teenagers from the estate turn their home into a 24 hour war zone. Among the people blinded by hate are Said, Vinz and Hubert, youths who survive on petty crime and dealing dope. In the intensely volatile environment, the teenagers find a chrome-plated Smith  Wesson 44 that a plain-clothes cop has lost. If killing a cop with his own gun doesn't express their rage then what will?   The French cabinet commissioned a special screening of this tragic story on its release, to see the problems of the angry French underclass on the streets of Paris.   "A brutally brilliant masterpiece of 90s cinema" - NME    urlLink Andy Kaufman Returns   The author of this blog is supposedly Andy Kaufman. He claims to be the real deal, the man himself. For one of his entries he posted a press release in which it states that he has taken DNA tests and had his fingerprints checked, all pointing that this is indeed the legend Andy Kaufman.  There are still those suspicious of all this, but if Andy Kaufman did fake his death, then why has he announced it on blogspot?  Keep an eye on this one guys.   urlLink Insaniquarium Game   A link that has been lurking around my favorites for a long time now, its time to dig this one up from the dead. Concept is simple. Keep fish fed, make them grow, collect coins, destroy aliens. Strangely addictive.   urlLink Arnie's Pizza Shop   Matt send me this link some time ago, and I found it hilariously funny for some reason.   "I'm not here now, I'm out killing pepperoni!"   That will have to be all for now, until something else of interest happens to me. One more thing to do though, I'll have to pimp Rebecca's blog to hell. She is at  urlLink prettyh8-machine , and will probably have something more interesting to say than I do.  I'm off now to do things, toodles!
