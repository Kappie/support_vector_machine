Some veterans who served with Kerry in the Vietnam war are coming out and claiming that he lied in order to receive medals and that he lied about the conduct of American soldiers in Vietnam. The  urlLink Swift Boat Veterans for Truth  (Swift Boat Vets FAQs  urlLink here ) is a multi-partisan effort to get Kerry to release his military records and thus show his justification for obtaining a bronze star, silver star, and three purple hearts in a four month period.  The accusations they level at Kerry are fairly serious. For instance, they claim that Kerry lied to receive a bronze star. Kerry claims that he saved a fellow serviceman while under heavy enemy fire from both sides. Other veterans who were at the scene, however, say that there was no enemy fire directed at the boats. SBVT also claims that "It is clear that at least one of Kerry's Purple Heart awards was the result of his own negligence, not enemy fire, and that Kerry went to unusual lengths to obtain the award after being turned down by his own commanding officer." I hope this stuff gets out. I don't think a four-month tenure which caused Kerry's fellow servicemen turn against him constitutes heroics, despite what Kerry would have you believe. I encourage you to read the Swift Boat Veterans' site; post a link to them. They have lots of interesting information.  Be blessed! Neo
