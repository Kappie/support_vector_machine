Start of a new month, maybe its a time for a fresh start in my life ?  Headed to Atrium at 12.30 today... didnt actually felt like going down, due to 5 tests coming on Monday, but had to hand the T630 over to the buyer at 1... so well, the trip there was inevitable... Saw TL and Alex not long after I reached the entrance of the arcade. Handed the hp over, got $350, and stayed till around 3.15 when I went up with Aaron and gang to PS to see them play ID and WMMT over at Star Factory. Felt hungry after that, went for lunch at the food court downstairs. Aaron accompanied me.  Backed down to Atrium again, to see some matches going on, and headed home at 6.30, to come back and do some stuff, at least before I head on to bed. Dont wanna hang out till 11 plus and then walk home again, lol, my legs ! Shacked out !  Just had a chat with Aaron on MSN, wah his words, kinda slapped me awake.... self induced depression.... ahh man... I have to just try harder, to get out of this mess, and live my life as was before, waiting for that special person to appear.  Night.
