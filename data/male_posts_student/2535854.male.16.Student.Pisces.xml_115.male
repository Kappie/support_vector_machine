First of all I miss Rodgers and Hammerstein..stuff came up and I though Sunday night had a show but fuck it now man..its to late..and its best I not say anymore about it..  Did a lotta lifting stuff and re-arangging the house since my grandma`s coming like beggining of July...Thank goodness for my Dri-fit jersey and weighlifting gloves..saved my hands from ruin :p.  Then went out to the pasar malam but just grabbed a Cranberry Tea Frap from Starbucks..a Grande sized one..A drink flavour which I hadn`t had since PMR Results day 2003!Although much cooler,a grande didnt even last a quarter of how long it lasted last time!Despite all the walking!But my blood my hot so had to cool down..sigh...was thinking of something hot to sizzle myself up but thought its best I cool down instead..sigh sigh sigh..!Cooled down though...  Turns out Wei Ning is NOT going to acc on Fridays..no!!!How could she!!!!lol..  grabbed pelita on the go and met Shu Yong on the way back..  ate.bathed.did homework.Blargh.  Riz.
