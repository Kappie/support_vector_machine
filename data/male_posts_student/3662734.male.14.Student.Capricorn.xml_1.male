I have many friends, but only a few. I currently do not have a girlfriend, but I am looking.  I spend most of my free time on my computer. I like designing websites, banners and awards. I am currently working a new website which is a dark community for goth teenagers or anyone who is interested in the dark and gloomy.  I am a gothic teenager myself. I have been since January this year. I like it and do not rejret converting to the subculture. I don't care what people think of me. They can all get fucked. I don't have a life. Like I said, I spend most of my free time on my computer. I do get out sometimes though.  My interests are; dark shit (dark, gloomy, black, ghosts, paranormal, vampires, haunted houses, spiders, death, all that other type of shit), computers (internet, web design), music (darkwave, gothic, depressive, metal, rock, punk rock), creative shit (art, writings), film (horror, mystery, thriller, crime), mental health (study of mental disorders, human behaviour, behaviour paterns) and counsilling (communicating with teenagers who have problems in their lives, especially teenagers who want to commit suicide or abuse themselves).  I plan to finish high school (yr. 12) and move to Sydney, Australia to live. There I intend to go to University and study graphic art (commercial art) and graphic design. I also want to be a counsillor (that is if I don't get into graphic art). When I finish my study at University, I plan to stay in Sydney for a few years, hopefully moving to London to live my life out...  This closes my first entry to my online journal. I shall continue to post entries about my everyday life as a gothic teenager. Welcome to my jounal!
