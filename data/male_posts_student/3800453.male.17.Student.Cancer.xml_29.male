(yeah he actually says bla bla bla...jk) and hes like, "im bustin my balls for you, are you bustin your balls for me?" and im like "no". i answered in simple one-word sentences, because thats all i could do, as he wouldnt let me reply. like always. so eventually, hes like, bla bla bla, ive done all this stuff for you, i feed you, im sending you to norway (which was because i got good grades this last semester and that was the deal, but he still uses it against me), youre living under my roof, bla bla bla. and im just thinking all this time, "you dumbass, why dont you just take it all away from me then if im not giving back?" see, this is what i @#$ing HATE about my dad and my brother. they dont understand what it means to "give" something. it means to pass it on to another person, WITHOUT expecting anything in return or ESPECIALLY using it against them later!!! i dont take anything my dad gives me now, its gotten so bad. anyways, my dads like dont you want a car? bla bla bla.... and im like no, not really, i dont need a car at the moment. and hes like, youll need a car, bla bla bla. and im like no i dont, i have a bike and a bus, and they can get me anywhere. so hes like, "well, i want you to have a car, and youre gonna have to earn it, and whos gonna pay for gas? and whos gonna pay for insurance? me." and im like no, if i want something that bad, i can get it. i told him i wanted to be completely independent of him. basically meaning that he has nothing on me. because he really thinks he does.  so anyways, today, since i was grounded from the computer for a while, this girl i know online called me to say hi and see if i was doin alright and all, so my dad picked the phone up and gave it to me, and we talked for a while, then my dads like, whos that? and im like this girl from elma. and hes like, does she drive? and im like, i dont know, it doesnt matter. and hes like, well if she can drive, then she can come up here and you can go on a date or something and im like uhh shes got a boyfriend. and hes like "what the fu...." and im like, "what do you mean "what the fuck"? can i be friends with girls?" and hes like, "someday youll know". and that pissed me off kinda. he basically thinks american women.. just suck. and they want money, and are bitchy, and all this other stuff. it seems to have been true with the girls hes been dating here, but i dont believe it. he probably just thinks theyre good for fucking. either way, he does not influence me very much, if any at all. id like to learn on my own. my brother and i have different tastes in relationships, and my dad kinda has the same thing going as my brother. you know, like, oh theres girls over here and girls over there, lets do them all in one night. and im like.. yeah.. im gonna pass on all that. i only wanted one person really. when .. i was a christian (i am not anymore, but dont get me wrong, i am no satan worshipper, i still have values too :). ) it mustve rubbed off on me, you know, all that pre-marital sex stuff. also, you know, the STDs, the baby risk,all that shit. id rather just avoid it all. yeah... the christianity thing. i wasnt gonna really post it. all its caused me is a lot of grief and shame though, theres no evidence of it all... why believe something that just hurts me. i live life to the fullest, as no one knows whats on the other side truly. i hate getting in religious debates on all of this crap, because it cant be proven or disproven. its a faith thing. no reason to believe, but they still do anyways. ive lost it. people join christianity, i think, because all of the people there are accepting and happy, and they think its a cool place to be, pretty soon, youre singin the songs too, etc, and you grow stronger off of that, well,insufficient evidencethat got you started in the first place. my dad needs to get on now (of course.). what do you know, more work. c ya
