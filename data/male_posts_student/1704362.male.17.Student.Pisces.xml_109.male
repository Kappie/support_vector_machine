A chilled silence fills the air, broken only by Conor cracking his knuckles. In a flash, they leap foward and run to eachother. Leaving a wake of old newspapers and other refuse, Conor and Conor plow toward eachother at near-inhuman speeds, their eyes filled with murderous rage. As they collide, they are both instantly converted into pure energy. The resulting explosion and shock wave levels the surrounding city for miles, leaving even more of the surrounding area uninhabitable due to radiation for centuries. Conor and his duplicate are now only echoes in a barren wasteland.   THIS CONCLUDES THE GRUDGE MATCH SERIES (FOR NOW)
