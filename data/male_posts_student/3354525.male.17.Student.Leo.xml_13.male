It was a crazy weekend around Whitby, particularly on Saturday night when Nate Dawg, Julie, and myself all got drunk while we were hanging with Brent and Justin.  A planned movie night turned into a trip to Tim Horton's and then a pool party at my house.  And Naveed stopped by for the fun as well!  In music news, the christian rock band, Creed, announced they have broken up.  Upon hearing of the breakup, religious leaders stated that this proves once and for all that there is a God!  It's official! Julia Roberts is pregnant with twins!  However, doctors say that it's abnormal to see fetuses so full of themselves at such an early age...  In world news, film maker Michael Moore apparently had footage of prisoner abuse in Iraq long before the reports surfaced in the news.  When asked why he didn't expose the evidence earlier, Moore replied, "Why would I give up my personal stash of a bunch of sweaty men piling up on top of eachother naked and having anal sex!?"  A new medical report has shown that some cholesterol lowering drugs may actually cut the risk of glaucoma, a leading cause in blindness.  The drugs were commonly used to lower cholesterol in the body.  So now fat asses everywhere can continue to stuff their greasy faces with fast food while also not worrying about going blind!  Until next time...  CK out.
