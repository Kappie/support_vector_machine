I had to have a guitar lesson and go to crappy school to pick my lappy top up. It felt so weird going back to school, it seems like years since i was back there. Also i have to go back there soon :/ I gotta get my suit soon lol should be fun going shopping for it. I love that feeling that you get when you dont have to anything for ages, its great. I got that feeling now. Can't really think of much to say tonite im tooooo boreded so i guess im gunna be leaving you now.  Tom
