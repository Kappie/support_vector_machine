We went to Yates aboout 5 minutes from Piccadilly but it was fucking crap. I had no money and Adam and Sean were being stingy! Slept most of that day. Went to Jilly's with Buffon on Thursday night, it was pretty cool! Had quite a few drinks. It's so good on Thursdays because it's soooooo cheap! I bumped into a girl I hadn't seen sincethe first time I went to Jilly's which was odd, she has changed so much! My gum started bleeding too 'cause Adam headbutted my lip-ring which then lodged itself inbetween two of my teeth. Luckily they didn't break! Adam sliced his finger open too picking up broken bottles (I dunno why?)... ok. We danced all night, amazing time was had. Got in at about 4.00am and fell straight asleep. I saw Mandy yesterday! She came over at about midday! I was so good to see her, I missed her so much! She stayed over and it was really nice. She went home this morning though, at 7.30! Too early for me! Anyway, I am knackered so I'm gonna go get me some sleeps. Bye bye...  xx
