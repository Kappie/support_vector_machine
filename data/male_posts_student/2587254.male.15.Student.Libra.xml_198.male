Ahh yes, so now back home from HYPE sleepover, and after a 3 hour nap, and Wendy and her family coming over for a bit, I am FINALLY firin' up my blog entry covering July 16-17. As usual, use your search feature to find the date by format of mm/dd/yy  (7/17/04 for example)  and start readin' =).     7/16/04  Last minute shopping for sleepover and day 1     Friday, since it was a long ways back, is somewhat vague, but I'll still try my best to recall as much as possible.    Ok, so my day started off at a healthy 1100am. After waking up, I preceded downstairs to eat my breakfast which was McD's since mom didn't want to cook today. So after eating, I headed downstairs, and chatted on MSN for a bit and also had to print off a few things for the sleepover. Afterwards, while packing, I then remembered:     Crap, I have quite a horrible memory. I need a checklist usually.     So then, I quickly called Rebecky, and then me and her talked on the phone for awhile while I was packing, and she was listing stuff off also for me. During this time, I was also talking to Joy and Gerts on MSN, well more of listening since I was already doing two things at once, almost 3 as I also had to keep track of what I had/had not printed off. Er, four, I also had to keep updated on the church key crisis, as we had no way into the church at the moment. That is, until Gavin pulled through and got his hands on a key. So crisis solved =P. But back to the MSN convos that I had while packing...Yeah, Gerts and Joy are awesome people, they have the most random convos.....well to me at least. I'm sitting there trying to keep up while there is a lot of LOL's and hahahaha's and of course SMPGO's, but yeah it was funny talkin' to them. Gerty then made me have a craving for a watermelon popsicle after she announced:     I have a grape popsicle.     So after that, I got hungry, but I had to go to Loblaws to buy the food for sleepover still, and then get to church by 4 to practice the worship part of the sleepover/Sunday Worship.    Shopping at Loblaws. Not much to say really, how exciting can it be? Exactly, not very. So bought the stuff we needed, and then headed to the church.    I was a weeeee bit late, but that's ok, as Carmen was still the last one to run through the finish line =P. Gavin and Josh were upstairs waiting, and since they were pretty much set, I asked them to help unload the food that will be needed for the next two days. I myself also did some of the unloading, including the stuff I need to sleep. After all the unloading, Carmen then arrived, and we all then began to practice for Sunday Worship.    That went by fairly well, and in around an hour and a half we were done. For dinner, I ordered Pizza and then Rebecky and Wendy arrived. Calvin also arrived too, and sat there watching us practice for a bit. So after we finished doing practice for Sunday Worship, Josh, Gavin, and I then got ready to do the HYPE worship session.    So the worship session went well. It lasted around 50 minutes, which was close to the proposed hour. It went well, not many mistakes, except Gavin still needs to remember that 3/4 time strumming is DIFFERENT from 4/4. But other than that, all went well, and we actually sounded really good I thought. But yeah, afterwards, after some clearing up and cleaning, we then headed downstairs for our Bible study.    Today Pastor Mackness continued with our studies on Proverbs, but looked more into Ecclesiastes. The book is actually very hard to understand, as it is really vague, and everything seems to be looping. However, in the end it all comes together, and the message of the book is to forewarn you about falling for earthly things too much, so it did all tie in together. I still wish that some of us could pay attention just a WEE bit more during studies. There are still those few who seem to just idle there and daze away.    After the study....and some snacks....came the infamous game of.....     GORGON.....*DUN DUN DUN*     Yeah so we played that for a while then *until 1am or so.* For the first game, Jason was the gorgon, which was a fairly decent length of time game. I got caught somewhat early, as Calvin was in my way when I was trying to run into the safe zone, so yeah, I got caught. It seems as though my forewarning statement of "MOVE!" didn't mean a thing, so yeah I got caught. In the end Jason won, and yeah, we lost miserably lol. It was funny with some of the things that happened. Plus the dark also adds a big factor as you can't see who the heck is running at you until you either hear him or you can actually see the person instead of a black silhouette. Calvin managed to run into a locked door, while Gavin ran himself into a dead end and got owned.    Second game Andy *one of the newer kids* was the Gorgon. This time, Jeffany *the other new comer* was one of the first to get caught, while me, Gavin and Jason lasted a decent amount of time *actually the other two lasted through the whole thing* but the emphasis is put on this. Our secret weapon, The Pillow *actual pillows* worked really well as working as inatimate obstacles and body shields. And since natural reflex is to catch something, throwing the pillow at Andy worked really well. Eventually I got caught though as he just caught me as I was running into the door, so yeah I got out. Calvin and Jason though managed to hold out through the game and find all the parts of the battery and then.....    Gorgon hunting.    We let Andy go hide since he didn't know the game was over so we gave him a 30 second getaway. Afterwards, me, Gavin, Jason, and Calvin went off on an expedition to find Andy. In the end, we FINALLY managed to find him, after almost an hour of searching, and we had walked right by him over 20 times and never saw him. In the end, he started to mock us with noises that we were FINALLY able to find him. We literally looked everywhere, and we all felt like a bunch of dumbasses when we found him at the end.    Wendy and Jeffany were the final two Gorgons. Well they counted as "one" quoted from Wendy, as they run slower. But it doesn't really matter since you know the dark and everything, we can't run that fast up stairs anyways. This game was fairly short, as eventually it kind of died out, and yeah, we switched to card games and stuff until 2am or so.    Oh yeah, also me and Calvin started a new trend for those who were caught out during Gorgon...    Fly hunting.    Yeah since we had nothing better to do while waiting for the next game, we began catching flies and putting them in some old cookie container from Loblaws. We managed to catch a grand total of 6, with one kind of split in half =S courtesy of me. One of the flies unfortunately moved a bit too slow or too fast, and when that cup came down to catch it, it got caught right on the edge. All of us were sickened by that, but it was another bounty caught. Me, Josh, and Calvin each caught a decent 3-4, for a grand total of 6. I say this because after catching sometimes, they kinda managed to fly off, so we caught them again =P. After the trend was over, Ken had arrived from Toronto, and brought FOOD! He had to host a VBS thing back at his home church at his place or sometin', so yeah he started drivin' late, and managed to arrive. I was surprised at the phenomenal timing he had.    Uno was the trend for many of the girls and guys, while Big 2 was the other, along with this other card game that used the Uno cards. After a lot of laughs and card games, we all split our ways *guys into one room and girls into the other* and then tucked into bed....    or a LONG game of Risk and the girls I don't know what they did.    Basically in the game of Risk, I self sacrificed and weakened out Gavin, which then led to Andy and Jason to be supreme rulers. Me, Calvin, and Gavin were all kind of weakened *me and Gavin had a huge clash* and Calvin idled. Josh on the other hand was having a merry time making stupid stories with the Risk men that were actually hilarious.    "WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A PURCHASE!?!?!?!?!?!?!?"  "I have no money."  "WHAT KIND OF BLACK MARKET TRADER ARE YOU!?"  "Broke."  "BREAK HIM! *JIU JIU JIU BANG BANG BANG!*"    And yeah that was one story, the other....    "Perimeter we must form around Jedi."    But yeah, anyways, I'll let Josh unravel those stories. But yeah eventually the Risk game ended with Jason basically victorious, and it was already 530am by then. A few of the guys went out to steal the girls' shoes, and I suggested they put them in the oven, but eventually they tied them to some pipes running overhead in the kitchen. So we just kind of chatted around until 6am, jumped Gavin when he was having a RAVE PARTY! and kind of eventually drifted off to sleep......     7/17/04  So.....tired....but.....worth...it     Yeah so after 4 hours of sleep, I finally got up at 10am, realizing I was an hour late for making breakfast. Apparently Ken and Rebecky were up already, along with Wendy, so yeah they had started already. Pastor D had to leave early for a wedding, so yeah, unfortunately he couldn't stay to eat. Making breakfast was fun, and somewhat gross, but all tied in together with laughs. Rebecca had broken two dozen eggs into one bowl, and Ken, thinking it'd be a good idea, dumped all the eggs in the frying pan AFTER frying bacon *the pan had dirty bacon grease in it* and started stirring the vat of eggs, with some of it burning at the bottom. Jason and I were kind of thinking "uhh, that's not right at all" while Ken kept reassuring "GUYS RELAX, IT'S JUST BACON GREASE. SEE THE EGGS SOLIDIFYING." The egg eventually turned out to be somewhat of a tannish colour, but it actually wasn't that bad. Bacon flavoured eggs in fact is pretty cool haha. The bacon turned out real nice though, as did the cereal...for obvious reasons =P. The toast was good on one side, but the other side wasn't even cooked lol, as I tried being like my dad and mass toasting them in the oven. The place reeked a horrid stench though, and I discovered that apparently the garbage can was beginning to get infested with none other than maggots. But yeah, we left that be for a bit *till after we ate* and dug in to the grub *ha...ha.....ha...........play on words........ha.........*    After breakfast, cleaned up, and did second session of worship. Went fairly well also.    And then came the Bible study led by me and Josh. Unfortunately, since we only had 4 hours of sleep, as with the others, we couldn't really stay focused really well, and the others, yeah it wasn't pretty. However I think Josh and I got the point through, and that was the Benefits of Wisdom in life. We spoke a lot about reputation and representation, and how important it really is. See, since we were made in the image of God, and God is perfect, then we must strive to live to be as close to perfect as we can get. Good reputation is one thing we revolved around alot, and we came to conclude that good reputation is useless, unless you use it to its maximum potential. Spreading the gospel can be much easier with a good reputation, as people tend to listen to you more. Good reputation is also one of the characteristics of a wise person, and it is true that many listen to the wise. Josh and I did a fairly decent job I thought in leading this *with MUCH help from Wendy and Ken; for me more thanks to Wendy as she REALLY helped me get through the study easier haha =).* Well eventually the study did end, with Josh getting a few more apologetics down also as a bonus =).    Afterwards, we just played some more Risk, chilled, and then went home after a wee bit of baddy also.    Once I got home....SLEEP!    *3 hours later*    When I awoke, at 8, all I heard was my mom talking to Wendy's family. That's when I realized crap no one woke me up for BBQ with their family. So I quickly showered, changed, and went downstairs to say hi to them. Apparently Wendy had been there for three hours already *whoops =P* so yeah, she was kind of bored. Eventually we both ended up chit chatting and watching Rat Race and WB Superstar before she had to leave. Her family brought cake also, so ate a bit of that, also dad's BBQ, and then back on MSN chattin' with many a people =).    Anyways it's gettin' late now, and I gotta head to sleep...so........    Later. This post is DONE.
