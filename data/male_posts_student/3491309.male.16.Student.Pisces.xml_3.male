You are an African American, you are popular, and your candidate has been eliminated.   Doesn't that sound like a bunch of bunk?  Not so.  Obama, the Democratic candidate for Illinois senator, now has a huge advantage after the withdraw of GOP candidate Jack Ryan from the race.  When a judge last week ordered Ryan's divorce records unsealed, it all fell apart for Ryan.  Ryan, a former millionaire banker and parochial school teacher, fiercely stated that there was nothing in the records that would apply to the race, only that his 9 year old son would be hurt if the records were unsealed.  The records indicated that Ryan had taken his wife, actress Jeri Ryan, to sex clubs and attempted to perform sex in public on her.  In the records, Ryan denies these charges, only stating that the couple went once to a rowdy sex club, felt uncomfortable, and left.  Ryan recently said that the charges weren't pertinent to the campaign, but withdrew from the race following pressure from Republican voters and officials.   Now, all of know that political sex scandals don't always unseat a politician; namely Bill Clinton and Arnold Schwarzenegger come to mind.  But what is it that makes or breaks a politician in America today?  Illinois was neither particularly conservative or liberal.  Surely Clinton's affair was more depraved that Ryan's.  So what the heck is going on here?  Perhaps it could be how he dealt with the issue.  First, Ryan told GOP officials long beforehand that there was nothing embarrassing in the records.  When Republicans found out the contrary, many said that they abandoned Ryan because he had lied from the start.  Bill Clinton, on the other hand, was a rather popular politician who had the full support of his party.   But what about Schwarzenegger?  When the tabloids picked up on various rumors, Arnold promptly said that he had been on some rowdy movie sets and that he may have done some wrong things.  Look at this:  we have a rather macho politician confronting this conflict head-on.  Clinton lied under oath about his affair, but he fought viciously throughout the whole process to keep his office.  What does this indicate?  I believe it's very clear:  Americans want more often for politicians to tackle the problems.  On that note, consider John McCain, a proven maverick who no one could ever accuse of being partisan.  The fact that McCain deals with the issues brings on popularity and support.  I can think of several politicians that could use such tactics, namely Bush but many others.  When it comes down to it, that's what really matters.  Americans are stating that they want decisive politicians that deal with the conflicts straightfowardly, no matter what the conflicts be.   So, Barack, Bush, and other persons, I hope you take that lesson to heart, you hear me?   Ponce
