I evern have been to the library twice in four days...yes i know, im just cool like that. On thursday i had Tri-S (registration) and a nice Journo meeting. Tri-S wasnt too bad this year; my Id card is just as hott as lost year's. So of course the most exciting part of it this year is the senior room...DISAPOINTING. Our senior t-shirts are ugly as hell. Instead of the kick ass superman style one, we got maroon ones that say "Who's the senior now?" on the front and, wait for it ladies and gents, "ME!" on the back. Very disapointing. The journo meeting countered that though. Im so glad we are starting with a new slate, this year will be amaing. New teacher, new computers, new layout, no censorship, no evil editors!  Friday was a pretty chill day, just went to the library in the day and thenWHAM GOOD STUFF HAPPENS. Like what kind of good stuff? CULLEN GOOD! He came over to watch a movie, but of course nothing ever goes as planned. I hadn't seen Kaitlin or Julia in hecka days and knew i wouldnt be able to see either them on Saturday. So of course once Rory hears im seeing the girls he wants to come. So we all go to dinner and things go well, Cullen says he liked them and i hope he just wasn't syaing that. Of course they LOVED him, how could anyone not? Then we dropped the loud one off and went to La Scala for a bit to see some LL peeps and play cards. I felt really bad bc the game was going crazy and he dindt know how to play and idndt seem like he was having a good time. I kept on asking him if he wanted to leave but he said it was ok, but it wasnt ok bc i wanted to spend some alone time with him. So we go home and watch the movie and talk untill 12ish when he has to go home to my dismay.  Today was just as boring as anyother day. Woke up, washed my car, picked up a book and Elana's and chatted for a bit, then off to the library. I got a good amount of work done but its never seems to end.  Came home, had dinner, talked to cullen!, and then somehting that never happens. For the first time in months, maybe even years, i lost to someone in my family in a boardgame. I curse the creator of Scatagories and swear on his/her grave i will be redeemed. So pretty much an uneventful night. The summer is winding down and i can't deny the fact that i dont want it to be August. I dont want to go back to school. But it is inevitable, and i must do my best to have fun and live it up on the weekends!
