Presenting the second part of the account of the past days      May 11    In a shocking,heart-attack causing election result,Chandrababu Naidu,India's most popular chief minister,after Narendra Modi of course,was voted out of power in Andhra Pradesh. His party,which had brought international recognition for Hyderabad and Andhra,was logged out of power with a paltry 47 seats out of 294,while the INC+ got 226.Though I had expected them to lose,this huge margin was certainly unexpected.     May 12   Day spent in extreme anxiety due to- a)SAT result after 2 days b)Election results the next day  I was very tense about my SAT result as everybody else who had given it in May hadn't done too well. And here I was ,hoping for a full score in atleast the verbal section.  Sight of the day-Sumanlata suggestively sucking a orange ice cream bar.I won't elaborate ,as being perverts,you will easily be able to guess what I am talking about.Manav ,take note.      May 13    First ,the Chemistry Quiz.   On behalf of Da Owl,yours truly,along with Manav and Anurag ,the 2 Quizzing Club Presidents,were supposed to organize and anchor the inter-section Chemistry Quiz for class 12. The teachers did a wonderful job in making the questions,a perfect blend of studies and trivia,which is what a quiz means to most of the world's inhabitants,barring a few Indians ,of course. I had also roped in Maanick,my nani's brother's wife's nephew,more popularly known as Sir Altitude and President of Unlimited Printouts Club for helping to operate the computers and of course,Siddharth Vyas,our resident Chinese (also known as Mr.Shanghai) for doing hard physical labour. I am an expert at such symbiotic delegation of duties.For both Sir Altitude and Mr.Shanghai,it was an excuse for missing Patalmata,Da Sardar and of course,Da Soporific's test,while for me,it meant having lesser things to do and concentrate on the more important things,namely asking questions.  It was also a day of the election results,so I will present a side by side account of both the results and the event of the day.  7.00 a.m-  We start off with the preliminary written round.20 questions,all quite interesting.  Some samples- a)Which is the only element which contains all the vowels in its name? b)Which beverage was invented by John Pemberton in 1886?  8.00 a.m-  First shock of the day. Bhavya's section fails to qualify,that too on a tiebreaker,that too on the last question ,which was answered correctly by atleast 14 of the 17 sections.Karan and Asgays too were eliminated on the same score of 3.BTW-5 teams were tied at this score. I personally could answer 7 questions  Second shock-My own section (M) qualifies with the highest marks.A pleasant shock,considering that I had to physically force them into taking part.  Third shock(Heart attack causing)-Congress leading in 72 seats,BJP in 15.  8.00 -10.30 a.m  Busy organizing stuff.This included making banners,seeing the questions and of course the election results in the Egurucool Lab. This time was also utilised in renewing contact with our kind and generous librarian,Mrs. Sneh Arora, who let me issue 10 more books after I returned the previous 50.  At 10.30- Congress at 109,BJP at 105.Good fightback  10.30-12.30 The main quiz. The sections which qualified for this were-  12 B-Akshat Vyas's 12 E-Shakti's  12 D-Bharjaiji(Sonali Bajaj)'s  12 I-PC and Gaurav Makhan's 12 K-Cosinetheta's 12 M-Rishabh,Parth and Divye's   There were 10 rounds, 5 general and 5 boring ones dealing with Class 11 syllabus. By a strange quirk of fate,I got to conduct all the boring ones leaving me to face all the brickbats from all the teams.Gaurav Makhan even threatened me with bodily harm. Anyway,we ran out of time and could only do 8 rounds,relief for both me and the audience.  Result- The bio sections B,E,D won in that order,with M narrowly coming fourth.12 I came last.  What a letdown for the quizzing team ,one didn't qualify,other came last.   1.00 pm- Checked result for one last time.  Horrors of horrors                     NDA     - 187                    INC+    - 226  My heart was palpitating at the visualization of Sonia Gandhi as PM. I was plunged into a state of depression for the rest of the day.      May 14     Day of making up past work in the class itself.More importantly,of the SAT result.  I got 1510-One thousand five hundred and ten only.This has been the highest in the school for my batch.  In Verbal ,I got 770-the highest in the world ,while in Maths,my score was 740-a measly 97th percentile.As predicted,my entire family was deeply angry.I had let them down again, something I have been doing throughout high school.     May 15,16    Fiitjee weekend. I was forced to give a treat to everybody in my batch.      May 17    Day the stockmarket suffered its heaviest fall of over 800 points. This is the day,when without telling anybody,I purchased 200 shares Maruti for a meagre Rs.350 each. See,my family has an inexplicable aversion to this share.I have been telling them to buy it for ages,when it was 125,when 242 and when 350 earlier.But each time I was dismissed by saying that it was too expensive.Even on this day,I was forbidden to buy it. Anyway,I still bought it surreptitiously. By the end of the day,it was 410.     May 18   Day Sonia Gandhi declined the post of the PM of India,leaving it for Manmohan Singh.The entire country was shocked,except for me. I had always predicted she would never become PM.  It was sickening to see the sight of hundreds of Congress workers bawling their heads off and threatening to shoot themselves.This just reaffirmed the belief that the Congress is a party of Chaprasis of the Gandhi family.I fail to understand why none of them could not understand this politically astute move by Sonia..In a single stroke,without even crying Vande Mata Rome,she has killed 4 birds with 1 stone.  a)She has gained the respect of the entire country,even of the 65 % who didnt vote for her. b)She has taken the wind out of the opposition's sail,leaving it completely without any issues to raise. c)She has got all the power without any responsibility of being PM. d)She has kept the gaddi safe for her idiotic children,who would never have got a shot at it if she failed to be an effective Prime Minister.  More importantly,the markets bounced back,and I sold my shares for a whopping 444 Rs. each ,a cool profit of 94 Rs. per share .Or Rs.18,800 in all.My parents were very angry when they discovered my transactions,but could not help congratulating me all the same.  This finally makes me a Lakhpati and the richest student of Da Factory.Yay.
