Tomorrow I'll be jammin' again... but if you're doing something after like 6 let me know...  If you know when Kairos are playing tomorrow let me know... I heard Lit is playing Saturday 11 to 3 I don't know if that is Am or Pm... tell me if you want to go... Sunday is Afterfest... The Earthtones at 8... Let me know if you will be there, we'll have to meet up...  If you have  an extra car let me know...  Well thats all for now I'll be back later maybe...  -Dan V
