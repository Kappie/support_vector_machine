Well as you know, referring to the entry below, I have lotsacraploads worth ofhomework to do..  But now ive done my Commerce work and the nastiest parts of BM which was to make sure my Karangan 1 and 2 book was updated by copying the stuff in Divyesh`s book..heheh...I shall do Chemistry Peka later...Econs later..Accounts can go fuck off. English isn`t much and perhaps i`ll do it later before I go to bed but I need to be sure of the work...cause last time I answered all the questions for this1 story when I needed to do only maybe 7 outta the 14 I did...aahahaah..rajin at least right hehe ;P  Well anyway ive planned to wake up at 6:30am and work out on the exercise bike and on the abs sculptor and then jog about 20 or 30 laps around the BSC field which isn`t very big comapred to the field at my school. I tried dragging Ryan along but he wanted to sleep instead :p...If I can get a handball sized ball soon, i`ll go and practise my shots and stuff :P...hehe...i`m so outta shape, lacking fitness and weak now...my muslces are losing its strength..and my abs aint at packed as they were though they werent really..haha..  Not going for the ICC Interact Installment crap which has the Installation day of CHS,BBBS,Samad and La Salle PJ which is at CHS which is likely gonna attract people by the truckloads..sorry Zhen! But congrats to  urlLink Zhen Cui  for being err president now I belive of the CHS Interact Club!haha...  oh yeah Afandi so damn fucking stoned didn`t see the oversized and overage written next to his name on the school futsal tournament forms!What an idiot...Shahril wrote it of course..haha...next time must write overweight..haha..  Anyway Ive dropped the idea of buying black trousers...looks like gotta wear uniform..maybe i`ll wear those green trousers I used when I need some pants of some sort to improvise the time at the beggining of the school year when I didn`t have the schools official pant trousers crap ready..just maybe..or maybe i`ll just wear my school pants in the end :p.  No tuition today..went on Tuesday what..hehe...  Anyway thats all for tonight I belive. Have a great ya`ll!
