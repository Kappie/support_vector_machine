I take the time to explore many branches or computing and are often testing, experimenting with software and trying to find faster, simpler ways. All regular computer users face loads of problems and I'm just another one of those people. Computer thoughts, problems, solutions i come across shall be posted.. Maybe it will help people out, who knows...  Ok I'm going to start off with my personal computer configuration: -Intel Pentium IV 2.8Ghz -512mb SDRAM -120Gb Hard Disk -Sound Blaster Live! -Geforce Ti4800 Yes it is a standard configuration which is fine, it serves its purpose. I will build a better PC when the task requires it. I have a home network setup comprising of 3 PCs - similair to this one specified above. A slow 386K down and 256K up ADSL connection is my gateway to this internet.  Wall socket > Dlink DSL-502G router/modem > 4 port switch > computers.  Look forward to posting more..
