Yesterday after work, Cindy attempted to put my kitchen table together with Laura's drill.  The screws were too long and wouldn't screw in far enough.  One actually chipped the surface of the table.  So we made a list (including smaller screws) and went to Walmart.  Not that a list is of any use.  I didn't buy most of the items from the list, I bought them as I saw them and actually didn't buy several of the items on the list (who would buy a $12 bath rug?)  I bought cereal and milk for Cindy so she'd visit me more often (once a day for 5 hours isn't enough).  She promised to visit when she's hungry, though since I bought us some appetite suppressants, I don't think I'll be seeing her at all anymore.  One of the items I did not buy, a new bike seat, is sadly needed.  The current bike has a seat that wouldn't fit a 5 year old.  It hurts to sit on it.  However, despite Cindy's recommendation, I am not going to get the one that is 9 inches wide.  This one needs to be tightened, I feel like I'm going to fall off.  My birds tried unsuccessfully to hatch their 3 eggs last week.  So she laid 3 new ones, but they're also gone.  They got sick of the new ones too and threw them overboard.  I don't know whats wrong with them, no babies in ages.  Perhaps the cat is scaring them.  I dropped Cindy off and parked in front of the library around 10:30.  I downloaded my email on the laptop and surfed for a couple minutes then sped home.  Thursday came and I had an eye doctor appointment at 11:30.  The only issue with living close enough to use a bike is you have to bike home, grab the car, drive to the appointment, drive home, bike back to work.  I am dilated and can't see anything clearly that is less than 3 feet in front of my face.  I had to hold my keys out as far as I could to figure out which one was the one to my office.  Good news.. my eyes haven't changed perscriptions in 18 months.  A van honked at me several times while I was riding on the sidewalk. I don't know if I had a sign on my back or what, but they were definately trying to get my attention.  They also honked at me while I crossed in the crosswalk.  Why?  I haven't gotten any mail yet at the new apartment.  I don't understand, I filled out the address change form.  I usually get 3-4 things a day.  I filled it out again and submitted online.  Hopefully it'll work this time.  I don't know whats wrong, but I wonder what mail I've not gotten since the move.  Mom wants to have dinner tomorrow evening at her job.  She wants to give me new pet fish.  I suggested I bring Pelligrino subs.  We'll see.  Hopefully tonight will be calm, I'm tired.
