Ok, I peeked and the computer said its  Saturday, I would have guessed maybe like Thursday or something.  I guess I have a little recapping to do, and thus far nothing bad to report.  The day we left the sees weren't too bad and we motored all the way down to an anchorage called Slaughter Harbor in between Great Stirrup Cay and Little Stirrup Cay.  We pulled in at about 6 o'clock after the 11 hour crossing.  The water looked nice so we did some snorkeling and found all kinds of interesting things in the shallow grassy sand below. There's a picture at the bottom of the stuff I picked up on that dive.  Deserted Island #1, Little Stirrup Cay: There's a catch to this islands desertion, it's only deserted at night when the Royal Carribean cruise line ships aren't anchored of its coast.  It turns out that this place is sort of a private island for the cruisers to play on. Nobody was there when we first pulled up, but when we woke up it was crawling with tourists.  So we made the 1/2 mile swim over and took advantage of the nice shaded beach chairs, female bodies, and wonderful free lunch.  One of the best meals we'ld had in a while.  Speaking of free meals, I forgot to mention that the night before we left Ocean Reef, the resort had a welcome party for the new batch of guests that had just been trucked in for the week, including another free meal. Aside from the meal they were doing a lot of social activities, one of which was sexiest male contest.  They pulled some guys out of the audience and a few women to judge.  Bare in mind that this is not a young crowd resort, so all of the contestants were old, mostly hefty, men, as well as the women judges.  Of course Alex and I were forced into the contest, though I was able to weasel my way out. However, Alex wasn't as fortunate, and damn I wish I had had my camera. He got so freak on the old ladies, flossing the shirt between his legs, spanking his ass, etc. It was damn hilarious, and of course he won, getting us a free bottle of Cocunut Rum which we will probably not drink.  Now back to the deserted islands.  Deserted Island #2, Hoffman's Cay: Still not 100% deserted, but much closer.  On the way here we did some good fishing, catching various fish including a rather large Baracuda.  This island is much bigger than the first, including a nice long beach near where we anchored.  It also had better snorkeling and plenty of fish for me to spear.  There's nothing more primal and satisfying than spearing a fish.  I pulled in 5 on the first dive.  I think we spent two nights total anchored here.  The reason I say this one isn't 100% deserted is because of the man-made gazeebo on the beach and the other people who pulled up on it while we were there.  Deserted Island #3, Bond's Cay, as in where they filmed part of a James Bond movie:  Closest to complete desertion yet. Only thing holding this one back is the boats visible on the horizen and some trash left by the previous temporary inhabitants.  This one is my favorite thus far, very exotic beaches, great snorkeling and a couple nice trees for me to put my hammock under. Today is our first full day here, we pulled up yesterday afternoon. After we got the anchor down we did some more snorkeling where we had our second shark encounter.  This time i was carrying a bleeding fish I had just speared, so when I looked over my shoulder and saw him needless to say I got a little scared. It was probably about 5 feet and pretty fat, scary enough to make me drop the fish and climb up on the tiny rock island we were snorkeling around.  Once I got out of the water, slicing up my hands on the razorblade-esque rock, I yelled at Alex who saw it and informed me it was only a Nurse Shark.  I wasn't to sure of that, but I got back in got my fish and continued swimming around with now me and the fish bleeding. Didn't see the shark again, but to let you know, we've heard stories and seen pictures of 15 foot Tiger sharks (aggressive like the Great White) and 18 foot Hammerheads in the Bahamas.  Today I spent most of the morning in my Hammock reading and watching the lizards do their little mating dance.  Until we saw a snake try to eat one of the lizards I though that the lizards were the only animals, besides birds, to inhabit these islands.  That pretty much catches us up to today.  The poker game has taken a rather disturbing and drastic turn, putting Alex on top with a score 21 to 16. Damnit.  The mood is much improved, but we are still going to head home soon. We should be close by the time I get to post this.  Its strange though. We have spent the week at arguably some of the most exotic beaches, and to ourselves on the most part, but its not as a satisfying feeling as one might expect.  The view we've had from morning to night is undescribable, and million pictures could do it no justice. We have nothing to worry about and nowhere we have to be, and yet I still don't find my mind at ease. Maybe its just too much to take in, maybe I've spoiled myself with all of the other exotic places around the world I've been too, maybe its that I know I eventually have to leave, or maybe its that humans aren't built to be perfectly content, which kind of makes sense because be absultely content would probably be the same as absolutely bored.  Anywho, we're ready to come home, not because of showers, cold drinks, air-conditioning, my car, a bed that doesn't have a ceiling and 3 walls, food that doesn't come in a can, but I think mostly because of the people, or maybe because we're broke. Back to the snorkeling.  TODAY: So on that snorkeling trip I finally pulled in a lobster, and we had him eatin in no more than 15 minutes after I caught him.  A later dive the next day I was able to pull a nice Grey Snapper and another pretty fish, but a baracuda ate the pretty fish while we hunted a couple sharks we saw swimming around while we rowed back to the boat.  The next day we made it down to one more Island called Chub Cay, not desrted, but with a marina. Not to much there exceptr extreme prices and heat so we headed back the next day.  So we made it back to the Oceen Reef Marina after our week on desrted islands.  It was good and we managed to cover 120 miles in two days on our return trip, not too bad.  We are kindof on our way home now, but I was able to pull another 320$ from the casino last night so I might try to convince Alex to go back down to Nassau to meet the Bainbridge girls. It would be about a 200 mile trip, but we could probably do it in 3 days. If that doesn't fly than we should be home maybe this weekend, or at least to Florida.
