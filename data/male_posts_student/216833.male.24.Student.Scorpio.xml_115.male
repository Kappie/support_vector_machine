I just said goodbye to my wife for a few weeks and it was alot harder than I thought. I am fighting off the tears right now. I am probably pouring my heart out into this little internet-station while people look over my shoulder.   Things are lots different now. There have been some great disappointments and some awesome adventures. The landscape is AMAZING. The weather is great, the people are so nice it scares me. I have alot to tell my friends about. Some things make me so happy and upset at the same time. I have not had alot of sleep and I can't seem to keep a natural handle on my emotions. I have seven minutes left on my web access so I am going to check some message boards.
