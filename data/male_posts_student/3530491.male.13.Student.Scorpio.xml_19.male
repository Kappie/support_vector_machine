As you may or may not know, I am the editor and founder of the Pretty Much Daily News, which (in my opinion) caused Owen to create this online newspaper.  I will contribute articles (and pictures) to the Gopher's Herald.  I will also occasionally post stuff on the blog.  Ah, but I am getting carried away. The real reason I have posted this letter is because I'm bored.  Oh, and I'll send you an email, Owen, of some articles sometime soon.  If you have not heard of my webpage, which is easily one of the most influential webpages of the 21st century (and, most likely the 20th century), you may visit it  urlLink here .
