     
      two gigs in two days.  both college graduation parties.  the group is sick, the gigs are great, the weather sucks momentarily, but that will pass.  lots of conflict bouncing around that head of mine.  luckily none of it is about the group--this group is coming together like 2002 never did, so I can't help being absolutely beside myself at that.  new songs, new arrangers, great soloists, new house, new attitude, new beginnings.  we went to Micah's house in Randolph after the gig tonight in Canton.  he has the most beautiful, vibrant family I've ever seen.  gigantic smiles on everyone who entered the house--smiles that made you understand where the one he always wears comes from.  so much love and appreciation and good humor and craziness.  they're truly wonderful people.  his father painted (and I don't mean ran down to Sherwin Williams and tossed two coats of "antique white" on the walls) the kitchen and living room himself.  he was an art major, and in the kitchen, thee was this really great mural of a white fence, a shrub of some sort, and on the ceiling, clouds and blue sky.  last night, Ed, Collins, Vic and I had a really intense debate on just about every possible bad topic of discussion between friends, but we came out of it with an immense amount of respect for eachother.  then Collins, Ed an I talked about our college groups and our hopes for this year, and the flawed spectacle that is the Hyanis Sound audition process.  certainly food for thought.  then today, Vic, Collins and I went to the gym.  willy's gym.  what a great place, and literally right around the corner from our house.  we did legs and shoulders and abs and holy crap I'm in pain.  because what did we do after we worked out? the three of us sat crammed in the back seat of Micah's car for two hours to get to our gig.  cramps galore.  thank goodness there were no stairs involved in this gig.  i had a post the other day that i wanted to put up, but my computer froze.  i'll post it retroactively in the next day or so. (it's not a positive one, but i swear i'm over her.  no, really.)  right now, i'm off to bed so i can finish the arrangement of "the best things happen while you dance" and teach it tomorrow.    sorry for my sporadic capitalization tonight.  i just really didn't feel like pressing 'shift' a hundred times.  how's that for lazy? ;-)  may the road, jim
