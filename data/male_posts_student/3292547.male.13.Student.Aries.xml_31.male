Though I'd like you people to finally respond for once (if you are out there) it's not too bad realy because I didn't know her.  The one thing I really did care about was my grandmother who was there. I think it really hit her hard when she realized that she was the oldest one left in the family. I hope t turns out alright. For a while we thought she was going to have a stroke at the funeral, but it turned out alright. Her other sister had breast cancer, and we are afraid of what might happen if she dies of it. It showed up again just a little while back.  Anyway, I have another science article to write and I really should be working on it. Might see ya later though. You never know when it comes to me =-)
