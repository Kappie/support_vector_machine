In the prelims,we came first, thanks to some computer related questions which came , which Karan had earlier asked me. In The quarters and the semis, we had the same result,1st. We had obviously shocked everyone, as no one had expected a team like ours(comprising of me, Ishaan, Aakash,Akshat), to reach the finals with a continuous winning streak.But today , disappointed befalled on us , as we couldn't even manage to get in the first three.We came fifth, ahead of Bhavya's team but behind 'DADA KI ARMY' , another DPS RKP team, which came 2nd. But I think it was quite a good experience, as I am quite young and reached so far ,and I encourage EXUN members to particiapte in this quiz as it consists of many many computer related questions, ought to come in Computer Quizzes.eg:- We were asked ' Which country's domain name is .ch' and '.pt' and what does Error 405 signify etc.
