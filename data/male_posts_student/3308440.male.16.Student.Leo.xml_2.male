Yes fun?!? Well I suppose it was better than the rest of the day because there was a bit of a water fight going on nothing to big but it helped pass the time on.  That was the fun part of the day the bad part is I am really tired from doing nothing ah well...  Just a question why does a person I thought I was a good friends with seem to ignore me and pretends I am not there???  Hmmm maybe I should say something instead of waiting for her to...
