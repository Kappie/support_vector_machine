I have these extremely detailed scenarios... like, real scenarios that are going to happen.  But I plan them out meticulously in my head.  I think about what I'm going to say when whatever I decide happens happens.  I'll often talk to myself during the course of all of this planning and such.  That's what happened tonight.  Plans fall through.  Events get moved.  Anyway, I was supposed to watch The Big Lebowski with a bunch of chill people.  I'm angry because it fell through.  It makes me more angry because it means I don't get to see Ryan.  This stupid obsessive crush is killing me, I swear.  But the worst part is I had this whole evening planned and it wound up (in my head) that I was talking alone with Ryan and ugh... damn him and his fucking charm.  This is ridiculous.  My school girl crush has turned into a creepy, almost stalker-like obsession.  But hey, I'll probably never see him again after tomorrow, so whatever.  And while I take some solace in this, it also makes me very sad.  Maybe he'll be here next year.  Probably not.  but who knows.  Abrupt change of subject: My dad gave me the infamous "no matter what happens between your mother and I, we'll always love you" speech.  I hate this therapist social worker bullshit.  It's the only thing worse than the two of them fighting.  I talked to my brother about it.  He thinks I should stop giving my dad a hard time about all of this, because he doesn't need that.  But frankly, I think he deserves the hard time that I've been giving him.  My brother didn't have to live through my parents fighting on a pretty much nightly basis.  He didn't have to stay awake because there was no silence.  He didn't have to hear the shrieking and the crying.  None of it.  Here's the fully story on my father.  Apparently, some time ago (pretty long, as in a couple years maybe?) he began an affair with one of the women that worked at his company's travel agency.  They had a long affair.  I read a bunch of their e-mail correspondences and frankly, they disgust me.  He acts like he just doesn't have a wife and kids.  Moreover, he lied about everything to my mother repeatedly, and took a long time to reveal what actually happened.  That is what transpired to the best of my knowledge.  I apologize for any errors.  I've never gotten a straight story from either of my parents.  Back to present tense. Ryan.  Ugh.  My heart is crazy just thinking about him.  Honestly, he's all I've thought about for the last 4 days.  It's really fucking crazy.  I feel psycho.  This is actually somewhat embarassing to write.    But hey, I'll get over it.  -Mike (Who apologizes profusely for the excessive length of this entry)  There's a fine fine line, between a lover, and a friend. and there's a fine fine line. between reality, and pretend.
