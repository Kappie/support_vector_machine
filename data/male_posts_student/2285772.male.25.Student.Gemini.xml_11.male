  it's hard to explain why i believe so much in the gospel. at the base of it all, i guess it's just cuz i do. it's hard to explain. i just know inside, in my gut, in my deepest knowledge that god is there, that he loves me, that his son died for me, and that god restored his gospel today. beyond that, it comes to the fruit. when i apply the gospel in my life. i mean really apply it, i am happy. truly happy.   what am i not doing?   when i was dating megan, i felt like i was truly happy. i really was. prolly the happiest i had been in a year. what's different now? obviously i'm not dating megan and that does make a difference. there is something more though.  when i was dating her, she sparked something in me. i started reading my scriptures again. i pushed aside my demons and tried to become a better person spiritually. my prayers became real. i've slacked and need to whip myself back into gear.   impressing others   highschool was all about what others thought about me. what a wasted life. when we spend day in and day out wondering what others think of us, we end up pursuing a life we don't really want. i still do it some. i try to make people think i'm this intellectual who thinks for himself and avoids conformity. it's bad enough when we lie about who we really aren't or don't want to be. it's even worse when we act on it and do things that aren't us or that we really don't want to be. i've tried to be myself or try to be who i want to be.   sin, guilt, integrity   why do i sometimes feel bad about doing something, but don't feel bad about doing other things that i know are wrong. i think it comes down to three things. integrity with god, integrity with others, and integrity with self. my mission president told me of an experience he had at a gas station. a lady saw his nametag and asked him if a cup of coffee would keep her out of heaven. his response was that a cup of coffee would not, but direct disobedience will. i think our level of guilt we feel is directly related to our level of commitment and integrity we are giving. i have found that when i do feel guilt for something, it is because it was something that i had committed to not doing. i broke my integrity with myself. also i have felt this guilt when i have hurt someone else in the act and lost integrity with that person. and i have felt the worst guilt when i know i committed (and i mean really committed) something to god...and then broke it.  on the other end, i notice that when i lack guilt, it is when i failed or seized to commit. when i have failed to decide (or even worse, decided to fail), i have felt no guilt.  i need to commit myself more. i need to make the active decision to follow god and do what is right.   what to do...what to do....   there are some changes i need to make in my life. i need to start praying more involved and personal. my prayers lately have been a routine of thoughtless words. i need to talk to god. talk to him as if he were sitting next to me, listening and responding. i need to do this nightly and when i wake up.  i need to start really reading my scriptures again. not just reading, but studying. they can be such a powerful tool. i did well a couple months ago, but as with other  things, i let it slide i need to serve others more. what better way is there to feel loved, then by expressing it i need to fight my demons i need to keep myself busy. to be active i need to focus on school better. i really want to get grad and post grad degrees. can't do that with lousy grades i need to get out more. i complained that people don't come to hang with me. i need to let them know i'm someone worth hangin with i need to smile. sometimes forcing a small smile can brighten our own day, not to mention others   leave a comment about what you think of this post
