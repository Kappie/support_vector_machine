A movie about a KISS-like rock band hijacking a commercial airplane and attempting to crash it into a Kansas church in hopes to open the Seventh Gate of Hell. Just a few questions on this one. At any point during the production of this movie, did someone think "Hey, maybe this isn't going to be a very good movie." How did anyone keep a straight face while making this movie? Who has the dignity to present this idea to a movie company? What actor receives this script and says "Wow, this looks like it'll be a real blockbuster! I hope I get to be the lead singer with heavy make-up that ends up landing a 747 at a large airport in the middle of a populous city. " How many people actually call up their friends and suggest heading down to the theater to catch a screening of this movie? I'd love to call all 4 people who have rented this movie since it came out and ask them if they miss their 3 dollars. Not that I watched it or anything, I just...read about it....shut up.  -alex
