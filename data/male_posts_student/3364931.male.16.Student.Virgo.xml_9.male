Title:Love...like a bus ? When the bus come, you look at it and you said to yourself, "eeee... so full...cannot sit down one". So you said to yourself, "I'll wait for the next one." so you let the bus go and waited for the second bus. Then the second bus came, you looked at it and you said,"eeee...this bus so old...surely very uncomfortable one." So you let the bus go and decided to wait for the next bus.   After a while, another bus came. It's not crowded and not old but you said, "eeee... no air-con one...and the weather is so warm, better wait for the next one." so again you let the bus go and decided to wait for the next bus. Then the sky started to get dark as it is getting late. You panicked and jump on to the next on coming bus. It is not until much later that you found out that you had boarded on to the wrong bus!   So you wasted your time and money waiting for what you want! Even if an aircon bus came can you ensure that th e aircon bus won't break down or will the aircon be too cold for you? So people...want to make sure that what you want is not wrong. But it wouldn't hurt to give other people a chance, right? If you found that the "bus" doesn't suit you just press the red button and get off the bus! But wait...I am sure all of you have this experience before. You saw a bus is coming (the bus you want of course) you flagged it and the driver acted blur by pretending not seeing you and zoomed pass you!   The bottom line of being loved is like waiting for a bus and whether you want to get on the bus and give the bus a chance depends totally on you and walking alone is just like being out of love. Remember to always say what you mean. If you love someone, tell. Don't be afraid to express yourself. Reach out and tell someone what he or she means to you. Because when you decide that it is the right time, it might be too late. Seize the day.   Never have regrets. And most importantly, stay close to your friends and family, for they have helped make you the person that you are today. Friendship is never an accident. It is always the result of high intentions, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution. It represents the wise choice of many alternatives. And remember.... Keep Smiling....coz... "Of All Things You Wear, Your Smile Is As love returns to me. The only way to find LOVE isn't finding the perfect person, but by loving the imperfect person perfectly. True LOVE doesn't have a happy ending, it simply doesn't end.
