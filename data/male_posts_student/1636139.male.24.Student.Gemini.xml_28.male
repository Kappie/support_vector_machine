The scroll-wheel on my mouse still doesn't work, since it's some obscure brand that Gateway bundles with their systems. But at least I now have Evolution  Mozilla-Firebird :-)
  
I also had lunch with  urlLink Mike Godfrey , a UW CS prof whose sabbatical is being spent working on Jackpot. He's quite a personable guy  one of the few professional computer scientists with perfect vision.
