Happy -  Skipping class, as per usual, and finding out I haven't failed my Mod Maths...  Excited -  Manchester United signing Alan Smith  Puzzled -  Danny Pugh's move to Leeds  Nervous -  caused by something requiring oratory skills beginning with the letter 'D'  Sad -  Won't be seeing my dad for the next month  Annoyed -  Finding out that the entire holiday is about to become one big joke  Peeved -  Sitting through 3 hours of tuition  Pissed -  Hell, hardly a week which passes without feeling pissed   Tiredness seems to be a usual condition of mine nowadays. Whatever happened to those days when I could sleep at 3am, wake up at 5am and keep going until 3am the next day? Heck, wouldn't be surprised, with all the load of crap that's been happening in school. I mean, has anyone heard of a four-hour duty duration for prefects? That is ludicrous, but yeah, that's what I did, and most other prefects too. This was followed by a rather aimless compilation which, by the time it ended, was time for me to go to the mosque.  Crumzz, life goes on...  Now onto more serious stuff....the Alan Smith transfer. Sincerely, as a very, very, very loyal MU fan since the age of 11, who really cares where Alan Smith came from? Who really cares if Smith had shown real commitment to the Leeds United cause previously? He's a good player, and that's all that matters. Seeing MU finish third this season was painful. Painful because it was caused by silly mistakes. Silly losses to Wolves and Leicester, and an even sillier and embarassing loss to Liverpool. Silly because Sir F decided to go an entire season with only SIX tried and tested defenders, one of whom was eventually banned for missing a drugs test (real clown, that guy), while another had just returned from an eight-month injury. Wow, I see the sense in that. And now, with all the frailties in defence, Sir F lets Danny Pugh move to Leeds as part of the Smith deal. Great. I sincerely hope Gabriel Heinze or some other able defender switches over to MU soon. Almost every MU member fan is bemoaning the fact that the Smith move is a cross-Pennine one, an almost  haram  type of transfer. Gee, if it was me, I wouldn't mind even if it was cross-Titiwangsa... Well, here's to Smith and to Fred the Red. To Liverpool fans, we're gonna get Gerrard (:P)! To Leeds fans, thanks to your club for being our feeder club (hope none of you beat me up after this)!
