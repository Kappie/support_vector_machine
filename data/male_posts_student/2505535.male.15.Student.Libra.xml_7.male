I was feeling a lil ill earlier but it went, seems most people arn't too good atm either. But my Primus DVD - Animals should not try to act like people, arrived today, it's really good, all their music vids, live shows, it's proper bo I tell thee.  Got a loooong day tmz, but atleast school's fairly easy. Right... back to El Goonish
