But I believe that basically he is a good guy at heart, and I will do my part to help preserve American democracy. Hell, I'd take almost any candidate over Bush. His corrupt administration that panders to corporations and espouses on moral values while lying to the American people digusts me.  To tell the truth, I was a Deaniac. That takes a lot of courage to say now, and many of the former Deaniacs will not admit that they once backed the Mad Doctor. I liked Howard Dean, Kucinich was the best man for the job, and Edwards was the most politically viable. But it is Kerry we have, and Kerry I'll support.   Kerry could gain a lot from running a clean, positive campaign. I don't believe he will, though. He could be attacking Bush much stronger on Iraq and the economy instead of arguing with him over talking points like gay marraige.  I think the reason Kerry will win is that many more people will mobilize for him and support him. Bush will have his run-of-the-mill conservative vote, but most moderates and maybe even a large chunk of moderate Republicans will vote for Kerry. I think this will be due to two things: Iraq spiraling out of control, and grassroots political campaigning. Many people will come out and support their candidate because this really feels like a battle for the soul of America. Organizations like moveon.org have already gotten tons of new voters registered, and these votes will go Kerry. Bush will have the money, but Kerry will have the people.  But if the Kerry administration becomes like the current one, I won't hesitate to wear a "Not my President" shirt with his face on it. I am only marginally loyal to the Democratic party.  Today, something happened that has never happened before. I had a halfway decent picture took of me! I was shocked because in every other picture I have always had a painfully obvious fake smile or a glazed, stoned look on my face. It is for my efolio and I am going to try and make it so the sidebar on the right has the people's pictures next to their names.  Speaking of efolio, John, you swiped my "Pressure makes diamonds," you jackass.   Today when I was driving to and from school I had to listen to conservative talk radio, due to my CD adapter being busted. It really, really, really sucked.   It's cool how we have five people to post here now. I hope more join.
