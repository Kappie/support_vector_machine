Good things though, but big scary adult things...and we all know how thinking makes my head hurt.  finally broke down, am going to do the three questions meme everyone has been doing. Got it from Gatsby's ghost, link on my side bar.  I want anyone who reads this to ask me 3 questions, no more no less. Ask me anything you want and I will truthfully answer. Then, I want you to go to your blog, copy and paste this allowing your friends to ask you anything.  will answer all questions...will post the most interesting
