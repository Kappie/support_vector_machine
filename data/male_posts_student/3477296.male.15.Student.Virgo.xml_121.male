Your calls of distress and gurgled moans of blog death have finally reached my ears and I will from now on make some fevered attempts at preserving this blog with pointless posts and banter before it completely withers away and fades into oblivion. Through the judicious use of skill, tact, strategy, grace and so much cunning that you could stick a tail on it and call it a weasel, I will attempt to salvage what remains of this stricken blog. Only the small obstacle of not actually possessing any of these skills and traits and possessing the negative inversions of them may prevent such a miracle.  If I were to say post any blathering utterances onto this blog, along with that industrious Andy chap, then perhaps there is some hope. Unfortunately I heavily doubt that my wasted frame posses any such stores of either effort or will power to be consistent in such a thing. However, I have identified this particular deficiency in my nature and compensated many fold by an ingenious plan which I will now shortly divulge.  For you see, I say that we could hook up numerous autistic monkeys freshly smuggled in through the most dubious of trench coats and stuffy boxes from third world countries that have only the sole purpose of exporting autistic monkeys to supplement as writers of this blog. Iâ€™m sure that some of these confounded animals won't nearly cut the grade at all in their ability to produce coherent matter no matter how long they bang away, but I say give them enough time and idealistic imagination on the readers behalf, they may well be half as bad as I am. Besides, when compared to the rest of the Internet, their work would positively shine like a dim half a watt home brand light bulb on a sea of steaming black animal feaces.  Enough of my convoluted crass talk. I will promptly stop myself before the sane and the impressionable are afflicted. Then again I am not the type that would bugger a lark for what consequences I produce, so you may well expect further exercises of hard, confusing reading in the future, although don't be surprised if its by a monkey of some type.  Yours,  Weller, the fashionably deranged.
