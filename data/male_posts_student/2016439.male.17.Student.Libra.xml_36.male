Actually, the most interesting that came out of this entire experience was the colossal fight that broke out between my mother and I.  We haven't really spoken in the last three days because she chose not to let me go see Katie in the hospital that night.  I was so angry that I said a lot of things that, though harsh, I don't regret even now in all of our silence.  True, children normally shouldn't talk to their parents in the way that I did, but it had to be said.  Sometimes things just build up in you for a while, and when one little thing sets it off, it REALLY sets it off.  In other news, I'm working very diligently on my Italian, as you can see in the right sidebar.  I love it to death.  Every time I start learning a new language, I get this really excited feeling in the pit of my stomach; it's what I look forward to everyday.  I have a friend (Laura) who's learning Greek, so I may ask her to help me out with that too.  My main focuses after I solidify Spanish, French, and Italian will be learning Greek and German, then maybe Portuguese (still debating on this one), then Hebrew, then the much harder Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, and all the other "-eses."  Languages truly are my passion.  I can't wait to study them in depth when I get to college.  My other passion, music, is really coming into play this week.  Thursday, I'm trying to get together my mini-band to practice  Pillow Songs .  I can't wait to hear how it sounds in the real world as opposed to a stupid midi file.  That is, IF the players can play it ;-)  Finally, I'm coming up on a crucial decision that really shouldn't be a crucial decision at this stage in my life but is.  I'm really getting torn between two things I really want to do as careers: television journalism and high school teaching.  High school teaching?  What?!?!  Am I crazy?  I've always wanted to be a teacher, and somehow, someday, I know I will be.  However, I also love journalism for the simple fact that you get to connect people to places, ideas, and world events that they never would have known about otherwise.  When I think about the impact TV journalists have had on my life...*shivers* Yeah, it's pretty scary.  What to do?!  What to think?!?!  Who'm I gonna call?!?!  The Indecisiveness Busters!
