Also I have had a lot of time to think of what to get Jadie...   What have you decided to get her?   Well nothing too great. I dont have a dang thing picked out for her that I know she will like. That is the bad thing about having our anniversary so close to Christmas, that I run out of ideas on crap to get her. I could go for the normal (stuffed animals, chocolate, flowers) but where would that leave Valentines day?  Ya know what material objects are no where near as good as memories. I will give Jadie the best thing that anyone could ever get. A night to remember forever.  And if you are using your perverted mind...then SHAME ON YOU!!! I wouldn't do that.... :-P
