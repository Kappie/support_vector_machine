Tomorrow at least I'm watching Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Not commenting on that, though, I'll have a more informed opinion tomorrow evening. Today, was, for a lack of a better word, very average. I know I covered this allready, but that's exactly how the whole of today felt. Had its moments, everyday does, but otherewise...*sigh*. I am still strugling with whether or not to finish up my studies, or go do something productive. Yes, they are often mutually exclusive. I might have more to say tomorrow, stay...connected?
