I can't decide if these people are serious, or someone is posting this stuff to stir up the troglodytes.  Quote:  "It can't be used enough...because the term, 'rich buddies' sums up the entire Bush presidency. His every policy is geared towards the wants of his rich friends. I'd really hate to see this craven administration take us to the moon when they are doing their damndest to pollute and destroy the earth--everything they touch turns to shit. I agree we are overdue for the moon, but I'd rather we go there to explore it, not so Bush and his rich buddies can rape it."  Me: It's all about exploitation and zero growth for these people.  They would cut off their arm to prevent any progress in energy or technology.  Funny....  My thoughts after I get back from breakfast.
