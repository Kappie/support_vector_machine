I will only miss a few people I work with and of course my two bosses and their son. Four the past four years I have had the privilege of working for two of the best human beings that have ever lived. They have done so much for me and have cared for and loved me through all of my ups and downs. I don't think I can ever repay them for what they have done for me. All I can say is that I love them dearly and hopefully I will get to stay in contact with them as well.  On to other notes. I am scared for school but starting to get used to the idea of me as a law school student. However, what is scaring me more is the fact that I will be alone this year. I have never been totally alone at school. I have either had friends to hang out with or a girlfriend to talk to. This year their are neither. My friends/friend lives in Denver and I haven't even talked to him in a week. Megan has dumped me and has moved on to other guys already (Amazing how fast she can get over me). And well the other few friends (at least I called them my friends---I don't really know if they would ever do the same) are either moved back home (Melissa O.), moved to Denver (Megan B., Aaron, and Cindy), or I just don't know how to ask them to talk to me or hang out with me (Brandon, Jeremy, Nathan, David, and Ryan). I guess this is part of me being alone. It sucks but at least I am hanging in there.
