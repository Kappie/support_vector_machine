And she's pretty much the type of girl I would go for, other than the fact that she smokes. But to be honest I don't really have a problem with that. I freakin grew up with smokers. Well that, and the fact that her best friends a guy, and he's lack, and she likes him. But he don't feel the same. See how easy it is for people to just open up to me. My government class is actually fun. The teacher is freakin cool. Mr. Fouser, I think that's his name. ROTC's okay, I really miss my U.S. Army ROTC though. It was a lot better than Del Norte High School's ROTC. Alright well I don't have much else to say, guess we'll see what happens tomarrow.
