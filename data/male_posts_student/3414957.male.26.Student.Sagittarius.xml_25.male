The teacher is very nice and laid back. Today we drew for 2 hours, different styles and techiniques, and listened to music. If only all my class were so relaxing. I felt almost sad to leave class, except for the fact my face still hurts!   I bought a new (used) pc today. It is very powerfull. When I get it all configured and up and running, it will smash this thing I am on now. The pc I am on now is really fast and can do lots of things. I want more though. I want to really try to get into more graphics design and more hardcore web design. Of course while those apps are open, I will be streaming audio from multiple sites, have a couple IM windows opne for chatting, surfing the web for more ideas and art examples, and whatever graphics editor I choose to use. Its a P4 with 512MB RAM...I plan on upgrading that to 2 GB of RAM!!!!!! Muah ha hahaha ha.  Other than that, I wonder about things alot now. I seem to do that when I am alone. I was walking on campus today to go to get a bagel formt he cafeteria and I just stopped and looked around at all the people, all 20 of them during the summer, walking to and from their classes. I wonder what classes they are taking, what are they doing in life? Then I continue on to the cafeteria and then the bakery lady, out of nowhere, starts talking to me all seriuos about her daughter and her son's school work and all sorts of stuff. I guess she needed someone to talk to so I listened for almost 10 minutes and then her boss or teacher or bakery manager wanted her to do something but she thanked me for my time and then gave me my bagel.
