It'll only make sense if you leave descriptive and sincere comments of concern; then and only then will the true brilliance of the Bloody-Eulogy Symphonic Suite shed it's skin, and emerge triumphant in your minds.    Just kidding.  Three topics to choose from:       urlLink Orchestra     urlLink Corporal Patrick Tillman     urlLink Bloody Baltimore        ORCHESTRA     In my orchestra, all throughout the year, the violins always have had a special place in there.  Firstly, because of the population of violins, which out numbers cellos, violas, and bass, 3:1.  Secondly, because of it's nature; it's been known to deliver the melody line, first violins, and the sweet accompany of harmony, the second violins.  When I first started out as a violist, I was a second.  Year after year, I would always have to play the same  rest-note-rest-note pattern ; it was boring beyond belief.    But there was one year, I think 8th grade, when I tried out for first violin, and made it.  Oh how I was joyed to be released from the bondage of boredom and sheer hatred.  I actually knew how it felt to play the melody of different songs, and I never looked back as some of my friends were stuck as seconds.    For our last song this year, however, Mr. Ferntheil has decided to play The Harry Potter Symphonic Suite and The Wizard of Oz.  Wow, I thought, we're playing a piece where the audience will actually recognize our songs.    You have no idea how much I hate both of our songs.  I can't explain to you how much it's an irrelevant part in comparison to the band.  Although, there was this part in Harry Potter where we got the melody for 3 measures--and then it was back to the old useless and boring accompaniment.  I've heard the sound track, and it's nothing like this one.  Strings actually have some melody, and there's a perfect balance between both the band and orchestra; so harmonically in tune, but we're not playing that.  We're playing the "arranged" version by persons unknown.  Damn those people.      A TRIBUTE TO CORPORAL PATRICK TILLMAN     We've seen acts of bravery and courage all throughtout wars, past and present.  But America, sometimes, forgets or does not know about the underbelly line of heroes.  I am here to tell you about one extraordinary man named Patrick Tillman, Corporal.  He and his platoon were ambushed April 22, 2004.  As his troop was taking fire, the Corporal jumped out of the military combat unit, and "moved into position to supress enemy fire."  1   Supposedly, Tillman was killed by friendly fire.  There is still, however, an investigation taking place.  But whether he was killed by Iraqis, or by his own men, his efforts shall not be forgotten; at least not by me.  That's the minimum of what I, no, America, owes him.  He died fighting for freedom, and I can say that not many people do.      BLOODY BALTIMORE     We live in tough times.  Very tough times.  It's one thing when there's inhumanity being born of war, but something else when it's reincarnated in this country.  The city of Baltimore, however, has gotten accustomed to murder.  The Washingtonpost says:    "...Baltimore has one of the nation's highest violent crime and homicide rates. Three years ago, three homeless men were stomped to death on city streets by a pair of teenagers and another young man. Two years ago, seven members of one family died when their home was firebombed after they complained to police that drug dealers were in control of their east Baltimore neighborhood. And two weeks ago, twin infants were found beaten to death, allegedly by their parents, in the trash-strewn basement where they lived."   2    And there's more.  Just recently 3 children died;  Lucero Quezada, 8, Ricardo Espinoza, 9, and Alexis Espejo, 10.  It wasn't strangers that caused their demise; family members did.  Adan Espinoza Canela, 17, and Policarpio Espinoza, 22, are suspects held by authorities.  So far, there are no motives; they've only found a large knife and a club.  But get this; they found one child decapitated,  decapitated , and the two others, "bludgeoned and slashed to death."  3   There were reasons for the prisoner abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib, however weak they were.  There were reasons for U.S. soldiers to die in Iraq.  There were even reasons to kill Nick Berg.  But for innocent children of Baltimore to lay decapitated and beaten to death; there is absolutely no reason.  The murderers are without excuse.     WORK CITED      1  Rueters.
