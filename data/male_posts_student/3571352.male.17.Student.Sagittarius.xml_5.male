Well that should have been my Senior quote because I format my PC like you change oil on a car... 3 months/3,000 pop-ups. :-P  So I  blew off gym and played Frisbee.  It was too damned hot to play kick ball on the pavement.  So after gym and lunch I went to my shop.  There was a computer to be repaired so I formatted it and brought it back to its stable state.  Well it just so happens that this computer had a virus on it that I fixed and the half-assed school network had a virus that kept shutting down the computers and rebooting them.  The head tech guy (EavesDropper) overheard my conversation with another person about a virus and assumed it was his situation.  He rambled on about "why are you touching those computers?"  Your not suppose to touch my computers" blah blah blah.  You should have see him when I said it was MY computer that I brought in to work on had a virus (though it really was not).  His comment was "Your Commercial Art, your not suppose to fix computers!"  This got me a little pissed off, lets just say to take my army knife and accident's drop it by his car and slip when picking it up WHOOPS! *Air Leaking*.  Though I would never do this ;-) because I know more than the damned tech's at my school its rather sad...  Well this virus was propagating off of the main server to the other clients on the LAN.  They are running all over the place trying to figure out what is going on.  They could have easily got a FIREWALL or even unplugged the damned thing from the LAN to prevent the thing from spreading.  All I can say is that they are idiots... Simple.  I can't believe that they actually went to school for this shit and can't narrow down which machine is sending out the virus.  Well enough of their sorrows, after school I went over to  urlLink Mac's  house where we played some Sonic Adventure and attempted to get his Mac Color Classic online.  This was useless, even though we put the proper IP in, EST. It still didn't work.  ---------------  Tech Tip of the day (if you did not get it before):   USE A FIREWALL!!11
