All I worry about now is money and time and even though that sucks, love and acceptance and friendship is something of a different story. I've grown bitter and neurotic early in my life and I am some what of a hermit. I just don't like random people all that much anymore,  I found out today that my brother's friend's brother OFF'd himself. That isn't official, but that is what everything is looking like. That makes me feel so fucking sad. I know exactly how he must have felt. I know I had thought of just ending it all a few times. We all have thoughts of suicide. I just could never give up like that. Sometimes that is the easy way out and I am sooooooo glad that I never dove into that statistic.   I am glad to know everyone. jeremy, pio, bryan, corry, nate, and all the badass fellas that I have met through the very extremely bad ass caveman - stick it out. Nothing is really as bad as it seems, believe me. I would much rather have another hello with each of you than a lifetime of goodbyes. So, know this from your good friend john. You are all the raddest guys in cali so keep on being overly rad! OK!!!!!   peace   current mood:  jealous current music: Vinaldi's Four Seasons
