It was  urlLink Chad  that told me I should get  urlLink Mozilla Firefox , as opposed to the crappy  urlLink Internet Explorer . (also he told me to experiment with  urlLink Opera  for a while too.  urlLink Opera  is quite nice as well)  But it's not just the software that interests me; the websites he visits are quite cool too. For example:  urlLink Wikipedia . This site uses  urlLink wiki  (which I was not too familiar with until tonight when  urlLink Chad  explained it to me). He was also the very first person to get me involved in  urlLink Where's George . You can use  urlLink Where's George  to track all of your american currency, free of charge.   urlLink Chad  also told me I should start my very own  urlLink blog . He has his  urlLink very own blog  and he uses  urlLink  Home">WordPress  However I use  urlLink Blogger .  Why?  Because Im not spiffy like  urlLink Chad  and I dont have my  urlLink very own domain . I am stuck using an  IP  Address website. But since my  IP  Address changes every now and then, I have to host a site that will link to it at  urlLink Geocities .  urlLink Chad  also showed me this site in 7th grade when I made my very first website (which is not up anymore, but it was terrible!!).  But as you can see,  urlLink Chad  has done quite a bit to influence the lives of millions...or maybe just one... :)
