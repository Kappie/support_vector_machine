Well I'm bored and waiting for my pizza to arrive.  urlLink Panago  has by far the best pizza. I don't know how anyone can think of ordering from anywhere else. Other then maybe the fact that you have not ever heard of the place since I am pretty sure it is just a Canadian company and I'm also only is in 3 or 4 provinces. Ha to you unlucky other places! I am only rubbing it in because I'm hungry and need food.  Mmmmmm... so anyway, now that that's over with. I haven't done that much but visit Ohio, parts of Ontario and Montreal since school ended. After that all I've done is work. In Ontario I looked at Universities and I think that I might end up going East for school in a couple years. I hope so at least. I really need to get away from home.  -  Dark Lily  0>--}---
