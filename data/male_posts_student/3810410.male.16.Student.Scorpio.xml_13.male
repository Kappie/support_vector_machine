When no one sings I can write these words, but do you know what they mean? Well I mean the best, you mean the worst I can’t decipher your meanings or codes Well I was last, you were first I can make it to the finish line on my own I know when I’m not wanted It’s when I am wanted I am not prompt This is my last goodbye This is my last farewell
