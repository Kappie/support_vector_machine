Yet, it is always great when I meet new people! I welcome him aboard! It looks like my great idea for a website is finally being realized by everyone else from Kakutama +3. It also looks like no one but Abby is posting on it. Looks like everyone has realized who the better of the two Emmons sisters is. The long battle has finally ended and I win.
