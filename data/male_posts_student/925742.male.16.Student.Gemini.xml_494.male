Who, upon seeing my Megadeth shirt and Megadeth CD, told me "Megadeth sucks."  She was wearing an LP shirt, and goth girl wearing a Korn shirt was next to me.  Right then, I was pretty pissed off at Witch-girl and Korn girl. I respect all music, but when someone takes a stab at my own favorite type, well, then, they get made fun of.  Since you two don't make fun of metal, I wasn't making fun of your liking of Linkin Park.  I was talking about someone else.  Didn't I say that LP has some good songs?  I have listened to them.  Wow.  Settle down.  I can't believe I have to explain things like this on my own little journal.  In other news.... Alex and I went out and saw Kill Bill volume 2.  We bought tickets to Hell Boy and then made fun of Megan Parott, who works at the counter.  Eh, she's a decent person, I was just giving her a hard time on the job.  Anyway, we 'snuck' into KIll Bill and it was freaking awesome.  The kung fu parts ruled.    I worked shortly today, and now am finishing up some songs for a cd.
