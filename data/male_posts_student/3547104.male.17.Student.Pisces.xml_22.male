After packing, I took a nap, woke up and decided to call this dude that I haven't talked to in a while. That turned out to be a very nice conversation (despite the fact that I sounded depressed cuz I had just woken up). So yeah, mid conversation, he decides to talk about his ex for like a second. Didn't really know why. I don't really care if it fits in the topic (as Gina advised), I really don't want to hear about exes. So after that, my good friend @ called me. Apparently her boyfriend fucked two other girls, lied about it... and no one told her, despite the fact that they knew about it. Honestly, people... what kind of world do we live in? IDK. I must finish packing... I have too many pairs of shoes I wanna take and I gotta fit em somewhere. Perhaps I'll watch Kill Bill Vol. 2 later.       Corazon Nate        Loving is good if your dick's made of wood       And the dick left inside only half understood her       What makes her come and what makes her stay?       ... I don't know...
