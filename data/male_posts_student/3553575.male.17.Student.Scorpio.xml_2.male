Well, I try to do poetry. here's my latest, if anyone happens to read it and feels like commenting, feel free:  Euthanasia  The tulips rise into the sky And reach their interweaving petals to the heavens In search of life, Only to be given that, From their heart underground. They sulkily sleep to untrained eye, But to me they are alive, Asking me to just touch them. To hold them and show them they are loved. To give them what we all essentially want. Their hearts beat, Pumping pigment into their thin skin shell. Green, Complimentary to our mammalian red, Spreads the color to the eye catchers, The petals. Their shade, Dependent upon the sun's rays, Gives direction for my pupils to follow. Standing over this creature, I can see the fireworks are going off inside its arms, Slowly getting brighter and more powerful, Until someday, Those arms are spent, And start to wither, And start to flail, And become limp, And fall onto the ground. But me, I can't let that happen. It is my obligation, As a witness of this display of chroma, To cut this being's life now, While it still has its dignity, While it still has its color, And while it's not in pain. And I do. I take its stem, And make a clean, swift cut, Tearing this being from its heart underground. I take this tulip home, And place it in a vase, Where though it's dead already, Its beauty overpowers The darkness of any room
