Then at recess, i went to the library to talk to kel and ryan....talking abt ragnarok den suddenly...haha there was a drop of blood on the table...i was like..what the hell? it was then when i realised that my nose was like, bleeding! Quickly took tissue and held it...went to the toilet where i washed my nose in the basin...then more came out and den i decided to sit on the toilet bowl inside one of the cubicles and tilt my head to rest....stayed there for like 20 mins till kel came down with more tissue....thank god cos i was running out of them..i was like thinking...did i see something wrong? Then i went to the teachers office, wanting to get an early dismissal form...Mr teng asked me to sit at the lounge and helped me by doing some weird treatments with cold water, did help...Mrs ng called my dad and yeah, he came....den we left for changi general hospital...went to see the doctor there and all he said was, "Nothing serious". I didnt even get medicine. Just an MC for today. Yeah, nothing serious, when i went home i got a bloody headache + a bonus, fever. This proves how much CGH blows.
