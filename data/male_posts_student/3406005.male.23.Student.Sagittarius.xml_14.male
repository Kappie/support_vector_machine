Don Braid had an awesome column in the Herald today; heres an excerpt:   This will be very frustrating," says Roger Gibbins, president of the Canada West Foundation. "Paul Martin said he was going to end western alienation and then he ran a campaign against Alberta.  "I don't know if this is actually dangerous at this point, but it certainly is troubling."  Gibbins says that after "bumping its head against the stump" one more time, the  Conservatives are going to have to ask themselves what they have to do to win.  For the Liberals, the technique for winning is absolutely clear. Divide the country regionally -- without, of course, ever attacking Quebec.  "What Martin will do now," says Gibbins, "is say he has to build bridges with the West."   And so Albertans are dissatisfied with their place in the federation. So what? Nothing ever happens. Threats are not taken seriously by Ottawa because they are not made seriously. Albertans are wimps.   A perfect example: Prior to the provincial PC Party's policy convention in Red Deer a few months ago, the Fraser Institute released two studies clearly meant to push the party in a more Alberta First direction. One recommended the adoption of a provincial police force ( urlLink here ) while the other advocated the creation of a provincial pension plan. Both papers were carted up to the convention and went, I was told, like hotcakes. The party's response? Form a silly little task force headed by Ian McClelland to examine "Alberta's place in Canada," with, of course, the proviso that separation is off the table. Ooh, big threat there. So instead, the committee held its hearings ( urlLink here  is coverage of the most star-studded one), stonewalled masterfully, and Albertans have been pacified.   So, Alberta, don't complain when the Liberals sandbag you and Ontarians buy it. Its worked for decades. If Albertans want to solve it, they know what to do. Start by asserting the province's juristiction against the federal marauders.
