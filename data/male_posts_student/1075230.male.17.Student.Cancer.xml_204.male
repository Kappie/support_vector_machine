I think I composed myself much better this time... and through that, I was able to think better and analyse the situation more.   Basically, my dad keeps to a single complaint (variating the presentation and peppering his speech with different threats and putdowns): i'm behind in my sciences. He can't even say I'm behind in my courses, because that would be not true. In fact, I'm actually ahead in three of my courses, which interestingly is something my dad seems blind to.   Keeping my mind clear during his lectures is most amusing, i see things that i would otherwise not see: he kept pointing at the chart "it's now december and you're suppose to be at this amount of units!! *points at sciences which are at 2s and 3*", then i stare below my sciences and see 3 other courses surpassing that line. Umm... looks like my dad might be partly blind... old age is really getting to him.   Later, he gives me another mini-lecture, which is basically the same message, except worded differently.    Now on to the purpose of lectures.    What I believe.. is that lectures are my dad's way of venting his frustrations (frustrations not only because of me, but elsewhere too). He has no other way of venting it, and uses me as a scapegoat. Does he believe that these lectures would help me? I doubt it... it's like... someone's incessantly yelling and insulting you... would you be more likely to listen to them? Or less likely? Ummm... tough choice.    Au contraire, these lectures are wasting my valuable working time - which ironically lowers my chances of accomplishing the goals of those lectures sooner. It also causes me to be angry. I do not like to be angry. But my dad insists on transfering all that anger and frustration to me. That is well and all, but he could do something more productive to vent his anger... like take up some hobby or something.    In conclusion, his lectures are simply powertrips for him. I must maintain my composure and not let my emotions get the best of me, 'else what happened 2 blogs ago would happen again. Umm.. but I could so tell that my dad gets even more angry when I appear calm... he prefers me broken down. He has that bully instinct =P oh well, what can you expect from a prison guard.    ~Chronos
