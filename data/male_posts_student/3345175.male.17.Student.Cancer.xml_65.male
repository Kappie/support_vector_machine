Man its like the boy feels that because he's gay he has to tell the world and make it a huge statement. He's the sorta person you cant really trust when he says hes gay, because he uses it as such an attention-tool, all like "oooh oooh look at me and how individual i am!" He's also the sorta person that jst cant accept that people being mean or slightly disciminative to him could be about something other than his sexuality. Tell him he's talking shit, or the colour he's choosing for his hair might look a bit silly, or get pissed off at him in any way, shape or form, and its like his head goes:  "Hmm...AutoClass: That must be homophobia!"  He's fighting this huge battle that there just isnt in his school or with his parents or where he lives. Nobody would give a shit if he didnt act like such a tosser because of it. He might claim to be standing up for equality, but really hes just working for the other side. He's making all gay guys out to be hostile at a time in people's lives when their opinions are shaped most, and he's acting superior.  This is where its like feminism. Feminism, as much as you might like the idea ladies, is not a good idea. It's not right. Feminism literally means making women out to be better than men, and we should actually be fighting for equality instead of fighting against each other for domination. Thats what Ryan's attitude towards being gay is.  He also thinks that coz he's gay he's gonna have lots of sex...and, eh, im sorry Ryan, but unless you're a nice person (let alone at least okay looking) and dont push away everyone who ever tries to help because you're "an individual", then you've got no chance. People dont wanna be with touchy, high-maintenance people who cant let sumone get close to them. And at 15, how many people do you think you're gonna have sex with? How many gay guys do u personally know that arent over 23? You are my friend, and as much as i have a huge gripe with u i care what happens to you. Being fifteen and actually looking for sex with strangers is not a good idea.  Thankfully, despite your better efforts, it hasnt happened yet.  And you are not "an individual" in this respect. Gay people might still be in the minority, but while you've been unintentionally and thoughtlessly pushing us further away from public acceptance, we've grown in number. We are closer to not being a minority. Still a bit away, but we're closer, and it hasnt been much thanks to you or me. Individuality means not conforming, and thats exactly what youve done. Youve thought that being gay meant you were unique, had something to prove to the world, something to battle day and night against - some terrible homophobic monster that would eat you if you let your guard down. You saw it as a statement. And its not. We are not stereotypes. We are not all hairdressers, dancers, stylists. We are not all totally against the government or the Bible or any faith at all. We do not all go to Mardi Gras, find transvestitism a personally liberating form of expression, and we do not all enjoy partying. And we do not all go out and have random sex.  Personally, even during my recent slutty period i didnt go as far as to want anal sex with strangers. Still virgin. And if i didnt know the guy i took precautions.  Maybe im hypocritical, as i hear you say...kinda. But im not. At least i dont think so. I went through a stage like this, where i felt like this. I went through slutty periods. But none of it went as far, or on for as long, as this. I kicked my own arse out of it. I felt like making a statement, like fighting the system. But i didnt. I kept it to myself. I was gay, and everyone who asked knew it. But I did not go around waving a banner and screaming.  "Im Here, Im Queer, Get Used To It"  Who wasnt used to it in the fucking first place?! Thats the sorta thing you say to people who are proven homophobes, not regular people.  You insult them, and worse, i find you're actions and reactions insulting to my sexuality and who i am personally. It's a personality trait. It is not WHO you are - it is a PART of who you are.     P.S. David hunni i hope ur not in from work too late this evening ;) Wanna organise something special...
