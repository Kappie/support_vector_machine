I mean, what on God's green Earth would I do if the internet suddenly disappeared one day, write a book, talk to myself - or worse a sock-puppet?  I am due to go to a gig with Jen tomorrow, but I'm not sure since she would have only just returned from the business trip to Paris to engage in the mass cocaine transportation shenanigan. Alas I may just be stuck in doors again, much like this weekend, after a huge blow out from a wide verity of friends and an argument with Mother; you would have thought by now that my spirits would be down and grounded into minuscule fractions, but I just put things into prospectus and everything seemed a little calm and more relaxed/peaceful, which was a good self-emotion/reaction if I can repeat it again on countless occasions coming up over the next year.  Ian is asking me for a deposit of $250 if I want in on the place in Mitcham, and I've been thinking long and hard at work and afterwards If It's a good idea to take it or not, and at the moment I'm quite keen, but it really depends on a number of factors and seeing whether they fall through or anything, which I'll discuss in detail tomorrow probably.    God I want my gig whore back *sulks*  xBuBzx
