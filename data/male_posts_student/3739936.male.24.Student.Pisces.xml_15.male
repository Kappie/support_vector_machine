I got into Torrents recently ...now that I'm a broke student again.  My current favorite site is  urlLink http://www.lokitorrent.com/torrent/ .  So much better than the really really old warez sites full of popups and bullshit.  Also much better than Kazaa (or however you spelled it.)   I'm getting back into making music  with Fruity Loops like I used to.  Mp3.com going under kinda set me off for a while.  I love making music although I doubt very many people really appreciate my music.  Some of my music is still out on some sites somewhere but I can't remember where.  Under the name:  Indolent Species.   Well, that's about all  I have to say today lol.   Keep smokin your gum and chewin your cigarettes.
