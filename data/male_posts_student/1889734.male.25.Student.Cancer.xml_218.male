If you don't know, I'm in the middle of trying to buy a house, and I've been out of the office off and on for some time now, trying to coordinate home inspections and a few minor repairs.  I'll get back to this when I can, and I'll continue to make short posts on topics that attract my attention.  Don't expect any Matrix-length diatribes.  But that's probably a good thing....
