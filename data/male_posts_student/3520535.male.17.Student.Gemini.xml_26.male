It's a great song and I'll always remember it as the song I was listening to as a large truck drove directly into the side of my car. If I ever have a cheating girlfriend I hope I learn of it over a song written by the guy who's been banging her. Also, in the movie, Matt Damon plays the singer, though he's obviously not singing. I'm not sure exactly why he's even in the movie at all. Oh well. See the damn movie. It was one of the funniest things I've seen in a long while.
