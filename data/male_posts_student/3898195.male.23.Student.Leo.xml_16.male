Tonight at work me and Abin (my cousin) was talking about this girl in Chinese. Eventually we felt like that the girl understands Chinese, it was embarrassing! Though she and her friends told us she doesn't understand Chinese, but to my believe I think she do. She was a full head blonde!  Come to find out that she is military brat, so we (me and Abin) is still suspicious about if she understands Chinese or not.  A lesson learned tonight at work... whatever you do and/or say, you need to be certain about yourself. Even if someone understands you or not they could be offended by your actions.
