It didnt even dawn on me untill I walked through my door. (My garage door, by the way. Why the hell do people lock theur front doors in Anaheim freakin Hills? The whole point of living in this community is the safety it affords you.) Greg, thank you for the road trip. Sorry everyone else fell through and you were left with just me for company, but it was enjoyable and more then welcome. If you've never taken the time to drive out to the desert and just stare at the stars, get out of you chair as soon as the sun goes down and drive. Just start driving. And don't stop until you reach the part of the world where the blanket of smog peels away and reveals a night sky full of mystery, wonder and perfection. Like God painting a picture on the sky.
