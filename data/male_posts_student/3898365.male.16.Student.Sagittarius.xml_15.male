Dude, The Shins have broken through. That opening "Woo!" on "Kissing the Lipless," was played on the Johnny Depp "A2Z." Obviously, I know that everyone who viewed that program immediately rushed over to the internet to find out who screamed that godly "Woo!" You know it.    Did anyone else crack up when that black guy on '99 said it took him four or five times to understand  The Sixth Sense ? Mmmm. I could live forever off of that stuff.    I watched  The Big Lebowski  today. For the first time. I know, I know, it's horrible. Not the movie, the fact that it was released in 1998 and right now it is 2004. Goddamn, that is my kind of movie. Just a long, nonsensical, and lazyyet complexplot and John Goodman rambling about his experiences in 'Nam. So so funny and unique. And I almost cried. Seriously, after they dumped out the ashes and Dude yells at Walter for all the 'Nam references and Walter just hugs him... damn. I want to make a movie like that. I just want to make movies.    What happened to that dream? My dream of being like Brendon Small and making a bunch of movies? I'll tell you what, it died, because I lost interest. I mean, I still really want to do it, I'm just not creative enough right now to write anything. I had that one script, and I think it was funny, but I lost interest and didn't find it funny after playing around with it so much. For the longest time, I've just wanted to direct a movie to see what it feels like. I think I could do a good job at it. Hmm.    But like I said in a conversation with Kit, "I don't have the persistance to make anything bigger than a sandwich."    Oh shit! Speaking of "Home Movies," Soup2Nuts is releasing a three disc DVD set of "Home Movies" on November 13th. This is very, very good news.    What the hell? They played part of the chorus of Denis Leary's "Asshole," song during '99, except they bleeped out the word Asshole. So all you hear is  BLEEP oo-ee-ooo-ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oole! So stupid. Why put it in there if they're just going to bleep it? VH1 needs to lower their bleep usage. Like during the South Park part, when Chef said " BLEEP  on my Chocolate Salty Balls. Put 'em in your mouth and  BLEEP  'em." You guys, God, the song is about a tasty salty chocolate snack. He is talking about eating his wonderous product that he slaved over in order to make some money. It is not some lude reference to oral sex. Christ. Get your minds out of the gutters.    Haha, I said that the black guy  slaved  over his food. Get it? Because we used to whip black people and make them do our chores without pay or food stamps.    I'm gonna be talking about "I Love the 90's," a lot for the next couple weeks, because it will be all I will be watching. Reruns have never been so tasty good.    I recieved a junk e-mail from someone that called themselves Shovelful B. Ferreted.    I found part of my script thingy. Opinions?:   (A man holding an ancient-looking statue runs down a road, being distantly pursued by nine security guards. The guards lose track of the man when they come to a fork in the road, so they stop to figure out which way he went)  Head Guard: Which way did he go?  Guard 1: I think he went that way! (points to left road)  Guard 2: No, no, no, I saw him go that way. (points to right road)  Head Guard: Okay, we'll split up. Half of you go that way (points right) and the rest of you come with me.  Guard 3: Hey, wait a minute!  Head Guard: What?  Guard 3: Well, it's just that.. there's nine of us. We can't exactly split in half.  Guard 4: Yeah! If you divide nine in two parts, you get four and a half! And we don't have a half-person with us!  Guard 5: We could make one. And if we're going to chop somebody in half, I propose that it be Johnson.  (Everybody but Head Guard and Guard 2 nod and mutter in agreement)  Guard 2: Shut it Langston!  Head Guard: Look, we're not cutting anybody in half! You four go that way, and the other four of you come with me! Now let's go! He's getting away!  Guard 4: Wait, that's not fair at all. We can't divide into uneven groups. What if he isn't working alone and we get outnumbered!  (Others mutters in agreement again)  Head Guard: Then what do you suggest we do?  Guard 3: Well, since there's nine of us, why don't we split into three groups of three?  Guard 1: But where would the third group go?  (A couple seconds of silence pass by)  Guard 2: Umm... How about they go back to the house?  Head Guard: Back to the house? But then there wouldn't be enough people out looking for the thief! Come on people! We need everyone out here looking for the statue! Now let's go!  Guard 5: How about I just go back to the house and you guys go look for the statue?  Head Guard: (Hesitates while contemplating the query) ...Alright, you head back to the house. You four! That way! You three! With me!  Guard 1: Why does he get to go back! It's cold out here and I have to go to the bathroom! I should get to go!  (Other guards chime in with their own reasons why they should go back to the house)  Head Guard: Everybody shut up!  (Guards all stop talking, except Johnson, who decides to finish his story when the others are all quiet)  Guard 2: ...and I left my hemorrhoid cream back there.  (Everyone backs away and looks at Johnson with glares of disgust)  Head Guard: Johnson... Christ, that's gross.  Guard 2: (pause) They.. they aren't contagious.  (Long pause)  Head Guard: People! We are getting off topic here! That man stole the statue, and if we don't get it back, Klein is going to fire us! Is that what you want?  Guard 4: You know, he's right. We really should be out looking for that guy.  (Other guards all cough-talk phrases like, "Bullshit" and "Suck up")  Guard 4: No! I'm being serious! How about we just have some kind of tournament to determine who gets to go back to the house?  Guard 1: Yeah! We could all play rock-paper-scissors!  Guard 3: No, we should have a basketball tournament!  Guard 5: You guys are so lame. A Magic tourney is the only sure-fire way to decide.  (Other guards simultaniously make their own suggestions)  Head Guard: You guys, come on!  Guard 1: Yeah, we all have our own ideas, so arguing is pointless. We need to think of a way to determine who's idea for a contest we should use to determine the tournament that will determine who gets to go back to the house.  Head Guard: If we don't leave in the next 30 seconds, you're all going back to the house in body bags.  Guard 3: Bags? Hey! How about we have a potato sack race?!  Guard 1: That's perfect! Jonas, you brought your bags with you, right?  Guard 4: Psh. When don't I? (pulls nine bags out from behind his back)  (Guard 4 walks around and hands out the bags to each guard. They all get in a line and prepare to start the race, except for the Head Guard.)  Head Guard: STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT!  (Guards all quiet and stare at Head Guard with confused looks)  (Head Guard pulls out his pistol and shoots Guard 5, killing him; When Guard 5 falls to the ground, Guard 4 goes down by his side)  Guard 4: No! You shot Terry! (starts sobbing) You shot Terry!  Head Guard: (While Guard 4 is still complaining) All right! Now there's only eight of us! Now can we please! Go and get the statue back!  Guard 4: (Looks up at the sky) Don't worry Terry! I'm coming with you!  (Guard 4 pulls out his pistol and shoots himself in the head and slumps over Guard 5's body)  Head Guard: Oh, fuck this.  (Head Guard slumps away in the direction of the house, slowly followed by all the other guards)  Guard 3: (to Guard 1 as they are walking toward the house) I told you they were gay.  (Then star-wipe, and.... cut)    I know, it's short. But at least I wrote something.    Kit should really start trying to write her Tech Deck mockumentary. Then we can bring it to life in film.
