I’ve been up since 2am, which is probably contributing to my overall freak-out. Also, my conference paper, due to be given in erm two-and-three-quarter days is not finished. Well, it’s not ready at all. And I haven’t done any work on it. I just keep reading this trashy crime novel set in Leeds that I found in the bedside table. I think Lucy Payne had more to do with the murders than she lets on. . . I feel like I’m on holiday and can’t be bothered with this shit.
