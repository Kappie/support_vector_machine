She screamed. *Oh my! That was LOUD!!!*   She was scared out of her soul - she wanted us to remove the bug.   We people who are lablled as "sadistic morons" squashed the bug with a glass panel.   *White and yellow liquid ozzing out... YUCKS!!!*   Miss Wun said, "Get rid of the liquid too!" *That was the real disgusting part...*   Then we did... and we had our Maths lesson peacefully...   Oh, something to note... I nearly expereinced a heart seizuretoday morning at about 6.00am. Wow, just a glaring flash and the lightning went "KA - BOOOOM" which I screamed my heart out. Phew!   Teddy-O-Ted, yucks!   *Tips of the day - Never squash a bug with a glass panel when the Maths teacher is around in order to prevent mental disorder and the repetition of Happy Tree Friends...
