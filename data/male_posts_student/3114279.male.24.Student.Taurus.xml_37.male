      Yo yo yo, this is Glenn, posting without any particular reason yet again, to probably make for a boringtastic blog entry. Anyway, welcs to John Titor, prophet to the new century and all around great guy. Isn't he great? He's great. I saw the new Harry Potter movie, which I enjoyed, although my roommate said it was terrible because they strayed from the book so much. Whatever. I guess I win out because I didn't read any of those books. Glad to see you made it back to the old Lake safe and sound, Nick. Two days of shooting on my new movie have been thwarted by weather. I hope this isn't a recurring thing. I can probably predict that I will be horribly injured by the end of shooting though, as a result of my thinking that I can wrestle, kung-fu fight, and bo staff fight. I can't do any of those things. We beat Megaman 1 last night, the hardest of all megaman games, and least fun. I don't think I'll ever even start it up again, now. What a fucking bitch of a game. I guess I should go and get ready for the stanley cup game, now. My team will probably lose anyway.
