This week has been pretty interesting so far... first thing, i had to serve as an escort for my older sister's Debutante ball ceremony.  The majority of it wasn't that bad... got to wear a cool dinner jacket tux and met some cool people... but during the middle of our outdoor ceremony it started raining and hailing full force all over us - my sister and i (dressed in very nice clothing which doesn't react well to rain ;) ) had to hightail it into the opera house to finish it all up and afterwards had to sit through three hours of painful french opera.  OMG it was painful.  the whole event lasted from 11:00 in the morning till 1:30 in the morning on Sunday. I was happy to see my grandma leave on Sunday (she is SOOOOOOOOO annoying!) and even happier to see my little sister come home from camp that night too.  She has alot of moviegoing to catch up on ;) .   Monday, we celebrated my mommy's birthday.  big 44 :D.  That same day my older sister left to visit a friend in Bermuda.  Yay, i now have the car all to myself :D.  so i took it off to get some cleaning and stuff.  pretty boring. Tuesday, my little sister's friends were coming into town to hang out for the week... a bunch of friends from boarding school.  Since they're all under 16 and don't have their lisense, i have to be their chauffer everywhere.  Whoopeedoo.  One of the friends i used to hate (we're better now), anotehr had a huge crush on me during half the school year, and the other i dont really know.  Hopefully it won't be too disasterous. Yesterday i took them around doing random stuff... the mall, the movies, etc.  I took some time of my own for my piano lesson (once a day for an hour) and to pick up my sister's car (surprise for her graduation).... then they surprised me by saying they had gotten tickets to see Spiderman.  We saw it last night, it was sooooooooo goood, i'll have to see it again asap.  I was really bummed though cause by the time i got back on Serra was going to bed... that reallly sucked.  Today is pretty boring thus far.  Woke up at 11:00 (yay for me) then just came online.  I was trying to have a nice conversation with Serra when all the girls came in, begged me to take them to the pool, then started asking me all these questions about Serra.  Well, i wasn't in the mood to describe to them how i have all these internet friends - i think that kind of news might be traumatizing to them. oh well, i took off and promised to call her later.  After i had dropped off the kids at the pool, i gave her a call.  I'm not good on the phone at all, especially when i'm talking to someone who i've only "talked" with one time before and i know so well from the internet.  When that kinda thing happens i get really nervous and start throwing on this fake attitude and voice.  i hate it when that happens cause it leaves a bad impression on me... i embarrassingly hung up on her a little sooner than i hoped.  now i'm sitting here talking online and making this blog...   ok well that was much longer and more boring than i was aiming for, but now we have somewhere to start from ;).   more stuffs later tonight.
