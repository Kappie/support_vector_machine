A well-dressed woman walked by and, thinking the garbage pail was a garbage pail, threw her Pottery Barn catalog in.  The cleaning person yelled after her, "Excuse me," she turned around, he said "this isn't a garbage pail," and fished out her sopping wet catalog and thrust it at her.  She had no choice but to take it.  So there she was, in her designer suit, carefully carrying a sopping wet Pottery Barn catalog, hoping not to drip it on herself.  Just thought I'd share.
