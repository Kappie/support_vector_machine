But I have some free time on my hands now  I also have holidays comming up, so lots of posts should end up here soon...  Have updated my website, somewhat  have had some new ideas too, but I will write them later. Ha! My cat is sitting with me  I am paying all my attention to the computer (writing this)  she is getting jelious. I love my cat so much!  Anyway, about my lovelife... There is this girl in Yr. 8 that I am interested in. She isn't interested in me  I haven't made a move or anything yet. I don't think I have a chance with her. Also, I had to tell my good friend in Yr. 11 last night that I didn't like her anymore than a friend. It was hard to tell her that, I know she is heartbroken. But I had to tell her. I feel so bad about it. To make it worse, my "best friend" is going off at me  calling me a fagot  shamming me because I told her. Her excuse for it was "I lead her on...", which I didn't. I tried to develop feelings for her, but I never did. It's not my fault I don't like her in that way...  Enough of that. I just don't understand people. Life is so hard. I don't think I can live with it anymore. Once again, I am having sucidal thoughts. Another thing that makes me even more stressed, is that I listen to everyone elses problems, but I bottle all mine up. I don't anyone about what goes on inside my head. I feel as if I am going to explode. I am ill. Mentally ill...
