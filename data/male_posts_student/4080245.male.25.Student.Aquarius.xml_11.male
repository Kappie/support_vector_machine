I assumed that it would be some type of inquisition with regards to why you have not yet found a job and what you are doing to find one but instead it was several short yes/no questions as to whether I had worked or not and whether I was ready to work.  Of course I answered them truthfully but I never thought it would be so easy to get free money.  After that, I made my first trek to Fitness World, the nereby gym I've been contemplating joining for a while.  Had a great 2 hour workout there and I have to say the facilities are the nicest I've seen.  There is so much equipment I only had to wait to do squats and the change rooms/showers are very nice and clean.  It's been a long time since I've been on an actual workout program and I'd almost forgotten how good it feels to exercise your body.  On the flip side of that I've been exercising my mind lately plowing through chapters of the book I recently started to read "Voltaire's Bastards's" by John Ralston Saul.  A fascinating read so far although the first few chapters have been a history lesson more than anything.  It is important though to lay a foundation and provide a context for the argument to come.  Having read another more recent book by Saul before attempting this one I can already see the connections and the evolution in his writing.  On a lighter note I spent the evening at movies last night.  I checked out "The Bourne Supremacy" first and then "The Village" after.  I thoroughly enjoyed the former as I knew I would.  It reminds me of the original television version I watched as a child only better.  It is rare that a sequel will surpass the original but Damon, I feel, is a better Jason Bourne than Chamberlain was and since we have already been introduced to the characters the supremacy improves upon the identity because it can elaborate and explore rather than introduce.  I look forward to hopefully another installment in a few years.  I know there is at least one more novel - the ultimatum - but I'm unsure if there are more.  I tried to read them years ago but found them a tough read like many spy novels with too many foreign names and details to keep straight.  The village on the other hand was quite bland.  Supposed to be scary, it turns into a love story halfway through with a twist at the end.  The writer and director seems to be pushing his formulaic scripts a little too far and should have quit after The Sixth Sense.  American movies mostly suck anyways, except comedies.  All the good dramas I've seen lately have been from other countries.  Check out "Goodbye Lenin", a movie I watch the last few days, for a great drama.  Be aware though that it is in German with English subtitles (great for those friends of mine that speak German).  Today has scarcely begun, but it is already 12:30.  I believe today I will: change my phone cell number to a Vancouver number; visit the doctor; go to the gym; do some laundry.  Not a very exciting day but these things need to get done.  Hopefully I will have something more exciting to write about very soon.
