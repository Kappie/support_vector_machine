My day started the same as any other, and I imagine any other for the people who were affected by the days events....Death isn't like one of your boys....you never get any warning or sign that the day is any different....  Anyway I was down in the Gross Anatomy lab doing some work on my dear old first, fat body, affectionately known as "Addy" (for her large amount of adipose tissue...gotta love medical humor!)....we had just started the head/neck block and I was dissecting the circle of willis (some of my finest Gross work by the way!)....at any rate Dr. Jackson enters the room and very matter of factly says, "My wife just called saying some plane crashed into the World Trade Center.".....me, Dr. Jackson, and two classmates (Eric and Spence) speculate for a minute and eventually come to the conclusino that some idiot had lost control of his Cesna.....I guess in hindsight it shows how inexplicable the days events were to us at the time....assuming it was some rich person's folly....  About 10 minutes before class started I decided to go to the lounge and check on my food in the freezer (we were having a rash of food thefts and I had a particularly good lunch in there that day although I don't recall what it was now)....well the lounge was PACKED....and some people were in tears....as I got in closer to the TV, I was just in time to see the second plane crash into the building....I went into the classroom to tell Dr. Jackson what had happened....somehow we still managed to get about 30 minutes of class in before the news of the pentagon crash and the threat of another plane going down (I think someone had mentioned Camp David, where we thought Pres. Bush was)....at this point many of my classmates were in various states of panic....people were calling home, checking on family and friends....  I remember a few distinct thoughts....My mom, dad, and sisters came to mind....our house is near the Atlanta Airport and I remember thinking very logically that hijackers with bad aim could take our house very easily if Hartsfield was one of the points of attack....I thought of my classmates who worked in New York....Caishe, Darrell, Trey, Fza, Joe's brother Jordan, even the former Miss Maroon and White Naila....I saw a few of my classmates with family in New York and Washington in tears and wondered if they had lost anyone....  The next few hours were a blur as I fluctuated from disbelief to anger to grief to exaspiration....I remember thinking how happy I was to find out (relatively quickly) that my limited NY connections were all safe...and even second degree contacts were all alive and well....I remember thinking to myself, "My grandmother has just passed....we don't need anything else like this" (I laugh at that thought given everything that has taken place since then)....  I remember that Me and Crystal were in the midst of a lightweight beef and weren't really speaking....we've been on good terms ever since....that brought alot of things into perspective for the both of us....when I got home I was so happy to see one of my best friends in the world....I made sure all of her people were okay....I told her all of mine were okay.....then she decided that we should go to the store and to the gas station....apparently her mother had warned her that in Texas they were raising gas prices (as much as 10 dollars I believe)....we got to the gas station and I swear I had never seen a scene like that, everyone was filling up....the prices had indeed gone up a few cents (we later found out that price gouging was illegal and would never happen like that....not when they can very slowly nickel and dime us to death as they do now).....we went to the store and stocked up non-perishables....we were eating canned green beans until the day we moved....  Well the world is almost back to normal now...people still hate each other now almost as much as they did then (except they hate muslims more).....I wonder what the world needs next....  Till later
