As you can see (very obviously), no I am not. Well, I've got diarrhea, from eating fried carrot cake yesterday. I asked the stall vendor to put chilli, but I never expected he would put so much that you can see a pool of chilli around the carrot cake. Well, yeah. I got diarrhea.   Ayioh. I left CQ all alone. Well, he told me he's hanging out with Yih Fei and all, so that's good. For a bit, I was worried how he's gonna survive being alone, until I remembered he can hang out with YF. Yeah..  Hmmm. Sunday ar? Yeah. I completed my Chem and Physics homework. Hmm.. I don't know how to do most problems...and today I didn't attend Chem lecture somemore. Sigh!! Yeah. I didn't really watch NKF, 'cept at the last for Zoe's performance! So exciting! So heart-pounding! Go Zoe!!  Okay. Er-hm. Proper decroum people. Yes yes. Today, I woke up with a terrible stomachache. After visiting the loo, the cramp in my stomach still won't go away. Now, past experience has taught me that this should be a cause for concern.   My intuition was right! I do have diarrhea! I decided not to go to school on the last minute. Hmm. Mother went to the Polyclinic for her own check-up, so I stayed at home and cleaned the floor. Meow meow! So long never clean the floor le. I did a rather sloppy job, because I felt terribly tired and my stomach is aching. Yeah.  At 10 something, Mother came back. Well, the doctor said I could develop a fever. Now, for the sake of skipping Mass PE, I hope I do. I know, stupid silly me. I really HATE Mass PE with a passion. It damn torturous! Why would the education ministry incorporate that into our education system, I don't know. They must be raving mad. Sigh! Anyhoo, I have to photocopy 6 copies of my MC, for the various teachers that need them. Oh well. So mah fan.  I came back and all I did was endless Internet Surfing. Ayioh...I am damn tired la. I wanna go sleep, but later got Friends. How?!! Sigh!  See ya romorrow. Nignt blog!
