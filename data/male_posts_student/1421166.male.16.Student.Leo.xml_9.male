But because I had make-up, I had to leave and come back after 2 hours plus. But when I came back, they already packed up...argh...I wanted to play!!! Argh..nevermind, guess there's always a second chance. Then after that went to church with Nat. My DG was preparing refreshments for the day. So we went to get bananas and strawberries. We were making strawberries and bananas in chocolate. Whoa!!! It was *yum yum*...though I only got a plate for myself. Don't know where I read it from, they say it's what they make as Valentines' Day gift. hehe...but who cares, as long as it's good food...haha! Then went to Mac's for dinner. Was talking with my Jie about Chemistry on the way there...haha...so funny. But my favourite subject la. And I asked Baoshun, Junwen and my Jie to teach me piano...hehe...so exciting. Which I learnt a bit today. Yippee!!! On the way...haha! Anyway, last night I had an interesting dream. I dreamt that my whole family, except Rose was going to Australia to study. And I was feeling a bit sad, and excited at the same time. Then, I said my goodbyes and boarded the plane and all the stuff. But the weird thing is that, when I got off the plane, I realised that I was still in Singapore. Really don't understand. Maybe God wants me to stay in Singapore...hehe...don't know la. Then Jianming didn't come today. So we had to join M3a for Sunday School. Well, they were doing Hosea. But in the end they didn't do much because of us. But Uncle Anthony told us about how people actually down grade themselves to worship lowly objects like animals and even S * * *...haiz...What's the world coming to. But I guess as Christians, we ought to do something to bring this people back to God. Somehow, during the first half of Sunday School today, as I was singing "Just let me say"...I suddenly broke into tears. I just remembered how God has done so much for me, what he did to take all my sins upon Himself. How I should truly love Him. Lord, I love you. Thank God.
