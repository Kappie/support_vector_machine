Haha really dun wanna take back physics.. half the paper was blank.. sure'll look good..   Anyway, today's still one of the best days this year.. hehe you should know why.. but somebody is daoing me.. I still have feelings for her..and it will always stay.. but I just wanna be her fren.. but why she still dao me.. I dun like ppl to dao me.. the feeling of being ignored is absolutely tormenting.. Or maybe she's just avoiding me.. I think I made her angry and pissed her off..I'm really sorry but I dun think she knows it.. Haiz can see that she likes another person liaoz.. and I'm back with my gf.. well life is like that..   Quote of the day: The best thing in the world is when two people love each other and hold true to that love.
