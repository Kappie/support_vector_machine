Then McDonalds, then dentist. Then back home and did some math homework. Nothing special, you know just another boring day except for the drums. Drums were fun. They never get boring. Tomorrow I'm going to Cory's for Aftermath practice to get ready for Saturday's show. Yes, this is my first show ever. I have never performed with SSM except for some adults at Dan's and besides that I've never performed. I'm excited, it's at Molly Bloom's, Saturday at 2. We got a good setlist and I think I'm prepared for it all, the rest of the band is. Funny, the first performance I ever do isn't even with my band. I'm replacing their drummer Ryan because he's on vacation somewhere. Well after this performance, the summer is near and my band should kick it up a notch along with other side bands I'll be playing in. I can't wait, I finally get to play in front of people, well besides my friends and family that have already heard me. I wonder if SSM will have alot of shows this summer, cough cough. We're all lazy and never plan any shows but this summer I'll get us some shows with the help from Schreck. (= Well for sure, I'm playing at Battle of The Bands, there's no way I'm missing that performance. If my band doesn't wanna do it, I'll do it with other people, I'm not missing this event. Also, I hear Matt C is having a crazy party with the guitarist from Dream Theater...at his house. Awesome. I guess I'm going, I think Schreck said to come because his band and all so if so I'll go. I wanna see this guitarist, I hear he's amazing and for everyone who doesn't know who Dream Theater is, it's a famous metal band but not that famous. They're f'ing weird, they do alot of Rush covers and all their songs are like 10 minutes of weird odd unexpected random things. Personally it doesn't catch my ears but it does have alot of talent. Ok well that's all for the musical lecture of today. Goodbye teacups.
