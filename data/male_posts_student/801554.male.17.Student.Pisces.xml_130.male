Right here in Rockford, Illinois  2. What is your favorite number?  42 of course. My favorite one digit number is 5.  3. Vanilla or chocolate?   Chocolate  4. What section of a bookstore would I find you in?   Hmmm. Most likely in the literature section, or perhaps philosophy. Or science. But I could be anywhere. Actually, you'd most likely find me in the cafe!  5. What kind of mattress do you have on your bed? soft? firm? water?  It's semi-soft.
