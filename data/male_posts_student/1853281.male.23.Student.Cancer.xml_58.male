It was so much fun, have not gone sledding in i don't know how long, and drinking and flasking certainly improve the experience. Am really happy that i have my keys again. Had lost them last night and got a callfrom mum this a.m. they were in her door. Everything is going well. Am not quite walking in clouds all schmoopy and lost, but am still grinning. hooray for boyfriends:)
