It was not to hot for when you are hiking, but when not hiking you are not to cold.  It also is not to long of a drive.  Yesterday was horrible though.  I had to spend my whole day doing things with the church, and have a million pictures taken of me.  I hate pictures!  Well, this week of school will be cool, because I have only 2 days of school.  I get the rest off for Thanksgiving.  I also get to go on my first varsity meet on Tuesday.  It will be fun!  Well, see ya.
