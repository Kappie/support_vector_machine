Laugh with me its funny. So was BOO!, a bunch of "scary" shorts that LC players perform.      anywhy, I could've sworn either Nathan or Jonah said something about Lara. Maybe it was just Thomas.  Michael said her posts weren't funny. We must all obey the Great Michael!.    Sophia: there wasn't a real poll. um. don't hit me.  or anything.  Jonah:  I want a spork of doom.  Thomas: I can't go another day without central heating.  Nathan: I hope that works.  Lara wont make a very good minion.    Lara:  You can still post, can't you? I knew I forgot something!  Erin: HEY! ERIN! um... YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO TIME TO POST RIGHT NOW(oops), SO I'M NOT GONNA BOTHER TELLING YOU TO DO SO!(ewok, be happy)  You know, I could take Lara off just cuz this is a lot of people to have on a blog. The spell check on this prgram didn't know the words ewok, Jonah, or Erin. I thought everyone knew those.
