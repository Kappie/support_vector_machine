But today, there is no training in school and i am now resting at home.  one is to have some personal time with my family cause it been a long time that i have not been with my family during saturday.  secondly, i wish to finish the unfinished homework.       Woke up at 10am this morning, and i was really refresh now.  My throat was burning when i wake up.  A bad sore throat day. haha.. shall end here.. tomorrow will be going to watch the firework at esplande.. haha.. see ya!
