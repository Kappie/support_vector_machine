The chemistry was... very difficult. Extremely difficult. But just about do-able, I suppose. There were one or two quesitons I knew, but some were just impossible, like 'what type of barium salt should be used as some sort of medicine, based on these facts'. I DON'T KNOW!!! But it's over now. After the 45 minutes of the chemistry extension, it was finally over. Until September, when I will start all again, (with maths, physics and computing) after foolishly chosing to do chemistry next year. Yes, it can be interesting, the main reason I chose it, but it is extremely difficult. Well, it'll make me look clever I suppose, unlike say... drama, media, film and english. (just THROW your life away,  urlLink dickybod ...)  So, I now have a free afternoon and all day tomorrow off before my next exams, which happen to be statistics and physics extension. Stats will be piss-easy, as I am doing the... Oh..?  FOUNDATION ! (immagine Nick and Matt saying this, it gets very annoying after a while), so the most I can get is a C grade. But I may as well do it, as it's an extra GCSE, and needs barely any revision. No, really, it doesn't. The questions go along the lines of 'Fill in this pictogram by looking at this graph' and 'Work out the mean, median and mode of these few numbers' Not exactly challenging. But I will do a bit of revsion for it, as if I got a D or something lower, I would look like a right idiot. I need to have a look over frequency density, and a few other things.  Then will be physics, which will probably be harder than the bio extension, but not as bad as chemistry. A lot of the stuff looks quite basic, like analogue and digital signals, resonance, momentum, and SUVAT equations. I best do a bit o' revsion for that tomorrow. I'll have a free afternoon and evening today. :)  Ok, more news about this heap of junk that pretends to be a computing machine. The story so far... The internet freezes.  I was advised to defragment. Defrag doesn't work, tells me to run scan disk. Run scan disk, and tells me to close programs, even though all are closed.  Think for a while. Informed by  urlLink nonnesuch  to ctrl+alt+del and close some from there. I do so. Scan Disk and defragment work. Internet doesn't freeze. All fixed? Turn on next day (this morning), it's back to freezing. Think for a few moments. It must have been the closing of programs that stopped the freezing. Close all programs but explorer. Fixed again.  And here I am.  Does anyone have any suggestions about this? If not, I may convince my parents that our computer is broken again, and not properly fixed.  That's about all for now, again. Ta ta all.
