I met many people there, the most memorable one was this Indian boy that kept whining "It's just a game" when I beat him 6-0. There was this boy too, by the name of Alistair, that I used to play with quite often, because his training slot was around my time too.  His mom was such a nice lady, and he was really such a nice guy. When I stopped going to the courts, I never saw him again. Only today, 3 months after his untimely death, did I know about it. Apparently he went in his sleep, with no medical records, no problems the day before. The baffled the doctors, and they could find no reason.  My dad always repeats the same old catch phrase when someone dies so suddenly: "frailty of life". Honestly if he can't find something fresh to say then he should shut his trap, sometimes people feel better without the overly used 'words of wisdom'. But really this death was a real bummer. How could someone so young be taken so early with no rhyme or reason. He's about my age so I inevitably started thinking "what if it was me?"  I really don't know whether I should feel upset or glad at his death. On one hand, this guy just left his single mother standing on the edge of depression with his death. From my very short time with him I could tell there was a lot of love between the 2 of them. When something like that happens you naturally feel a little upset, but this time the feeling's different. It's this warm, fuzzy feeling in my heart that tells me not to be upset. Well actually I don't know how to describe the feeling so I just used an old and cliched catchphrase.  Those who know me would also not know that I've been thinking about death ever since I reached a certain level of maturity. All along I had feared death, feared the pain, feared the thought of going to somewhere really, really bad. Then my thoughts matured, and philosophy came into play. I knew what I wanted from this world; nothing. I've all along wanted to die an early death of old age. All along I've wanted to live a short, meaningful life; and die a painless death. I thought death by old age was the ony way death would be painless, but this death has opened up a whole new dimension for me.   I really don't know why the thought of changing places came to me. I know if I were the one to die my family would be devastated. But they have my sisters don't they? Then again I've always been the special one. The more intelligent one. The one that has the most hope in life. That poor lady had and now has no one else. I feel so sorry for her, but what can I do? If the lord were willing, if he called out my name, I think I would really not hesitate. I think I would gladly swop his place for mine.   By saying that I'm kind of implying that I have a really bad life. That's really not true. I have a really great one, but if my death could do something so miraculously good as to bring mother and son happiness, I would gladly do it. My only wish is that that could happen without me feeling pain. I'm a sucker for pain.
