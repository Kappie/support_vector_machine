Alright this blog is dedicated to a little cheerleader out there named Chelsy (actually that’s not her real name, I don’t use ppls real names here, out of repsect for them, well cept for mine, and louis’ and natty’s….and errol’s but he’s a dumb little bastard and he knows it, anyways “chelsy will know who she is…hmmmmm maybe she won’t….she is like that after all) who keeps bothering me to do one of these on cheer leaders. She wanted me to be mean cuz apparently that’s when it’s funny, so any of my other cheerleading friends out there please don't be offended...what am i saying? All and any female over reacts about anything, even if it's all in good fun (yea i know i'll pay for that one). honestly high school cheer teams are just a joke, they don't do anything good and all their cheers are ripped off of other ppl. and not to mention they're completely useless, like if i want to cheer for a sports team it not the cheer leaders that make me do that (they do something completely different) it should be the talent of the team that makes people cheer. and it is. not some air headed chick making some attempt to appear graceful while they jump around and wave pom poms all over the place. at this point i'm taking back everythingi said and i'd like to remind you all i did this by request...you hear me? REQUEST! my life was in danger if i didn't. -Matt
