They're introducing "Coke C2" Tuesday, in an ad being shown during American Idol. Supposedly, it's got half the calories, carbs, and sugar of Coke Classic, but retains the taste, for people who want to cut back but don't like Diet Coke.   Personally, I think all this "low-carb" and "look at me, I'm skinnier then an anorexic penguin" attitude that the country has is bullshit. As long as you're not inhaling sugar like you need it to live and you're getting in a good 20-30 minutes of running every 1-2 days, you should be fine. Nobody cares what you look like except for yourself.  Too many people worry too much about their health. And guess what?  That means they're not fucking healthy!    But, what're you going to do? As long as companies are going to make globs of money off diet this and low-carb that, they'll keep tricking people into buying it. Hell, I'll support them, it's a brilliant marketing strategy. DRINK THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE FAT:
