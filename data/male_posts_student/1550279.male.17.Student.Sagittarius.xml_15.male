I had Subway for lunch on Monday, and Thursday was the first time I could manage to even look at my computer monitor since then. I'm still not completely better (although I can eat pretty much whatever I want to now), and every once in a while I'll have issues walking straight or standing up since I'm still a little dizzy. Oh well, at least it's better than spending over 2 full days doing nothing but lying in my bed. Summer and I really need to have a talk about what I'm supposed to be able to do and how I'm supposed to feel (Hint: This isn't one of them).
