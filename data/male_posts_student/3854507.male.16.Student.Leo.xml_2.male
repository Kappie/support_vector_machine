A kind of rite of passage for the socially inept I guess. Anyways i'm  hoping that this might evolve into something intriguing and interesting, although I accept that all in all i'm just adding to the vain and self-serving crud that has blocked up the internet....kinda like the cholesterol in its arteries....  I only hope it has a heart attack....
