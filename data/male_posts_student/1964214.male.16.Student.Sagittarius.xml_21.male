That wasnt how it went.. haha The playground part was most ridiculous.. haha.. we didnt burn down the place.. cuz if we did.. then it would hv been on the news.. and we would hv been famous.. ha. the fact is that some of our friends came along and helped put out the fire with sand. Though i must admit. It got pretty big at one point of time. And the exam cheating incident.. it wasnt me who got caught.. it was er.. how do i spell her name? er.. Yiru??? well yah it was her fault.. gave us away.. and the teacher actually bought our reason.. haha.. maybe she just didnt want to blow up the matter.. either way, i'm glad we didnt get into any trouble. i remember we used to play Hop-Scotch in the parade square. during recess, before school, after school, haha pretty much all of the time we were free in school. Alot of things had changed since our primary school days. for one.. we lost contact with everyone. so i dont really know how they all are doin right abt now. Its been 4yrs. Time flies.. haha i remember how we would get into fights over trival matters.. acting "beng".. real stupid.
