I was suppose to go out with my Lao Da to Sim Lim Square to stock up on some CD-R(s), and then to Bugis Junction's cold storage to look for pans for making cheese cake. So we got our CD-Rs and headed towards Bugis. Lao Er called, asking us to make a trip down to the Akira building down at Jurong East to get her and her Honey each a set of cordless phone which was on sales. So we agreed.  Coming out form cold storage with the pans, I dragged my Lao Da to the edge with me. Silliest thing was that I walked out when the lift stopped at the second floor, I could have swore that I saw the display showing the third floor. We walked around once, twice. Scanning through every store, especially those which sells small figurine items and weird stuff =x. Still I don't see any doraemon or one piece figurine which Tara describe. It's getting late, so we got onto the train and headed downwards to Boonlay.  Along the way, I feel asleep standing like I always do when I go to school. Now this was the first time I've actually got off that station. There was free shuttle service to take us to Akira, once again I dragged my Lao Da to walk with me. *yawn~ Big mistake, I can hardly catch my breath when we reached. Sad to say, we were late. All the $59.90 sets were sold out, what's left was another model which cost $109. Called Lao Er to make confirmation and she's willing to pay more. Its limited to one person per set, so I had to walk up to the casher and pay. ARRGGHHH there goes my pay!!! She better returns it to me!!!   Outta Akira and towards IMM to get a drink. We got the new sundae float, which is like the original float. When I say like the original, I mean the ice cream will be had to reach when you finish your soda. Having the ice cream stuck with the ice cubes was bad enough, the addition of hot fudge makes it impossible to suck anything up. Next Someone else called, it was Lao Da's friend asking her to meet up. DAmn DAmn DaMn!!! Now I have to carry everything back home. Shouldn't had played with those dumbbells earlier on. So here I am, back home with aching arms again.
