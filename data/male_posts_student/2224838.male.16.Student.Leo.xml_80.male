I would like to be a rap singer because it would be fun. I could spread God's word and get money for it. I want to be a very strong Christian and lead many people to Christ.   Sometimes I get left out of things because I'm such a strong Christian. But I won't quit.  I wonder what happened to Nate's aspirations to be a rapper. He could have called himself M.C. NatoriousFAT. It's pretty cool that he was focused on his Christianity when he was 11. He seems to be staying true with it today, so that's cool.  P.S. I have free reign to make fun of Nate right now because he's out of town. He will probably get me back when he comes home.
