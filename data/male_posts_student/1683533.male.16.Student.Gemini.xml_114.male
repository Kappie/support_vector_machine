Did a band practice today...we accomplished some I guess.  By the way, the name of the band is After Hours.  I am very frusterated at how we get distractred so easily.  I probably need to cut practice time to an hour or an hour and a half.  We know the songs pretty much, but sometimes we fall apart.  I really would be embaressed if we went to my cousin's and we didnt have these songs down.  When we start practiocing we usually get about a half hour of some good work down, but then everybody goes off on these tangents for ideas for new songs, or changing new songs.  I'm trying to get the guys to understand that we dont have time for that.  We might have time to work on one more song, but we really need to work on these songs and get them like the back of our hand so we dont look like idiots.  I tell them this too, but i cant seem to get them to listen...I dont really want to push it either, cause then the whole thing will fall apart, and I am sick of bands not working and breaking up just when we are about to get something done.  So far I have a couple of solutions:  1. short 1 hour practices, short, but gets us time to get stuff done, and not get distracted.  2. after the AP test, two practices a week, and of course short practices  These are only ideas...I want to have some fun, but still get stuff done.  If you have any ideas write a comment.  Dont freak out band members and quit and shit, I'm just kinda frusterated, and I want to share some ideas....
