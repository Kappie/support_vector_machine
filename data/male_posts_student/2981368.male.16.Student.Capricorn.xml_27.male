At least I think I did the right thing leaving IT...no doubt if I don't ask tomorrow Jack will try to murder me. Bah.  On the upside, I managed to do better than expected in the geog exam *woohoo*, we have hockey tomorrow  *WOOHOO*  and it looks like its just started snowing. However lightly, that has to be good.
