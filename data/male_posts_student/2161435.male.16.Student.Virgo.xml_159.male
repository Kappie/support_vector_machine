A "male friend" of mine went away this morning to France :( damn France, they take everything! Its going to be weird not talking to him every night and now I'm feeling kinda lonesome *looks around for sympathy...gah!* But anyhoo, today I've been revising out in the sun for my darned science exam tomorrow. I've never really been able to REVISE so to speak, I've merely just skipped through the pages and remembered random sentences such as "polar bears have large paws to spread out on the ice and snow". Maybe this is why I suck. Wish me luck for tomorrow *laughs nervously*
