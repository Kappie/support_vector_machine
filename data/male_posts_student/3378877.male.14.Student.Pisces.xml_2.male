Which kind of sucks but then again I like people having their own thing even though there is like 10 girls in my school lesbian/bi:  - Hannah Biss. - Va'lyndi - Katherine - Alison - Summer - Ashley S.  * Ok, I thought for sure there was more but I guess not. Oh there will be later on I am sure of it!  * It's also strange how all of the lesbian/bi girls all smoke pot or cut themselves [haha]. Butits not my problem, I just wish that people would come out like the gay/bi guys. Then we would be a diverse school, which in ways would be cool [4 me anyway].  * Well thats about it, I'll write later tonight probably because I have a lot to say later on. I just cant think right now!   stay tuned   kd
