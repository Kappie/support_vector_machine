The Blog won't load properly when the Comment server is down, since it waits for a response each time it hits a Comment field in the HTML code.  I'm sure you've seen the problem if you've tried to view in the past few days.  So we are back to business, and I'm going to get some things posted.  I'm sure you are all overwhelmed with joy at the prospect.
