Shouts out to Brandon's Aunt Jackie for cooking the fire, fire meal in New Orleans and helping make sure we got to San Antonio with a satisfied belly....  Boos and Hisses go to the traffic in New Orleans (who cares about the Bayou Classic)....and the traffic in Baton Rouge....and the walls in Dallas....and that sign that says 837 miles to El Paso....that's cold bisness....  Shouts out to the homie Brandon and his lovely wife Martha for opening their home to a nigro like me.....  Boos and Hisses to the club in San Antonio called the Atrium....too crowded....bad bartenders....too many rooms....just sucked!  Shouts out to Taco Cabana for having the bomb burritos and showing me how janky Taco Bell really is....  Shouts out to sleeping in till 1 on Thanksgiving....and eating lots of Turkey and watching lots of football and playing lots of playstation....and catching up on old times....  Shouts out to the mall in San Antonio with the Banana Republic and Watch Station and Bostonian that gladly accepted my SunTrust ATM....and the always dependable Best Buy....  Shouts out to Cavender's Boot Store for holding some boots I never came back to get....and even more shouts to the one who had the right size and in 30 seconds had me out of the store with my dad's Christmas present (at least half of it)....  Shouts out to Savage's....one of the top 5 clubs I have been in in the country (and I've been in some from Miami to D.C.)....extra special shouts to the cute girl who threw it on me during Break Yo Neck....truly lovely....  Shouts out to the Billiard's place where we threw back drinks....  Shouts out to Taco Cabana again....damn they are good....  Shouts out to Djarum for making bomb ass menthol cloves....and x-tra special 420 shouts to Brandon's nigga who gave us some of the best greenery this side of Seattle....man....I had a dream about that stuff....  Boos and hisses to Whataburger for not advertising your damn burger stands on the exit signs....a nigga had to settle for Jack in the Crack....  Boos and hisses to the entire state of Arkansas and their horrible traffic....  Shouts out to the lovely Crystal for bringing me my mail....  Shouts out to Tasha and Heather for caring whether I made it to and back from San An safely....  Shouts out to Nile's girls for coming through the spot....  and finally shouts to GOD for letting me live and do my thing....  I'm out....enjoying my new DSL!
