Jack Grisham, lead singer for the punk rock band TSOL, said his qualifications include misdemeanor drug arrests, a year of living homeless and daily struggles to pay for his family's health insurance.  "Most of us aren't riding around in Humvees with bodyguards," said Grisham, 42, of Huntington Beach.   Grisham said friends from his record label, Nitro Records, urged him to run.  "I said I wouldn't do it if it's a joke," he said. "It's not a joke to me. Being a father with a couple of kids is not a joke."  --------  We might have a battle between someone who sings about fucking the dead and the Terminator for governor! Damn I wish I could still vote in California!  ***
