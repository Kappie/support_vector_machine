How crazy is it to think of things in historical significance?  Last time the Cubs were in the World Series, it had been a few months after the last Atomic Bomb was dropped.  If I were able to control the outcome of the Playoffs, this is what would happen:  -Red Sox defeat Yankees, sending those overprices asses into two hundred years of mediocrity. -Cubs meet the Red Sox in World Series -Cubs win. -Michigan Ave. has a parade that rivals Boys Town...  I think if these events unfolded as I have laid out, I would have to stop watching baseball for the rest of my life cause it couldn't get any better.  Speaking of life, if the Cubs were to meet the Red Sox, I have a feeling a lot of old people in Chicago and Boston would die happy.  Kind of like when the Millenium rolled around, a lot of folks held out until the ball dropped, then they did.  I'm sure if I was 90 or 100 years old and my fav. team finally won the WS, I'd be able to go peacefully and happy.  On to lighter topics  I'mdoinstreamofconciousnessrightnowandifeellikejackkerouacbecauseiamnotusingspacesandi'musingthewordandasaperiodanditwouldbereallyhardtogetthisunlessyoureallyenjoyjackkerouacsoifyoulikejkihopeyoulikethisexperimentcauseicantkeepnottypingthespaces.  Exercise for your eyes yo.  I've got a psych test tomorrow.  I'm more worried about being able to sit through the test, than the test itself.  Rediculous isn't it?  I get infused on Fri.  I can't wait.  Besides herion addicts, I'm about as happy as you can be to get stuck with a needle.  Unless I got a tattoo.  I've been thinking about it.  Probably when I get real money, and a real job and....I'll find reasons not to do it. I've got the design picked out.  Spades man, spades.  Recently, I've been having an extra-ordianry amount of dreams about ex-gfs and crushes.  I'm pretty sure this is a byproduct of two things: thinking about them before I fall asleep and being lonely.  I'm  this  close to giving my pillow a name...Like Linda or something.  I don't think I can fall asleep anymore without having something to snuggle with.  I can't believe I'm writingthisrightnow.  Guess its cause I'm tired (or at least that's what I'll blame this shocking honesty on).  While I'm on an honesty kick...I'm gonna stop.  Actually I'll just pose a question.  Have you ever had, what I'll refer to as a "sex flashback."  Doesn't necessarily have to be sex, but somesort of intimate thing, where BAM out of the blue, you get a sudden rush of all sensations of that moment, taste, smell, texture the whole nine yards?  Happens at least once a month if not more.  As if my classes weren't boring enough, my senses decide to remind me of a better time, a better place and I'm stuck.  grrrr.  Time for bed.  More dreams to follow.  The one that caught my attention today was multifacited in the fact that I was combining many locals.    At one point I was in Highwood, motoring back from the Hoagie Hut on the chair I am currently sitting on, typing this garbage.  I was heading to Lake Bluff.  When I got there, I entered a friends house, a kid that goes to school here.  I haven't been to his house in about a solid decade.  I walked up his stairs into his room and found out that another friend/roommate was injured.  I came to my apartment, which was more like a loft and walked next door to find my real roommate's ex-gf hanging out with one of my ex-gf.  My ex was clothed, or at least I thought she was because as I went over to comfort her, (apparently she had broken up with her perpetually stoned boyfriend) I realized she was wearing a thong.  Someone else pointed this out and she ran out the door and switched into her yellow colored strawberry adorned pajama pants.  I looked into her face and it was so vivid I couldn't believe it was a dream. K, come to think of it, in regards to scenes involving sleeping, I do use one ex girlfriend fairly extensively as the template for conversations.  Cause its all I know.  And they say you should write what you know about.  So I guess my great novel on Alaskan Moose hunting will not be written this year.  Now its really time for bed, where I'll have a thousand good story ideas run through before I finally succumb to sleep and will be awoken by the froterism fan club downstairs deciding that if they can't be bumping bumpin to techno, they'd rather be banging doors so they can at least feel a beat.
