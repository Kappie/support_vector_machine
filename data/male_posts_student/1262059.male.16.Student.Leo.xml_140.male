So here I am, posting on Blogger.    First of all, comment on comments: imo, the old way was better    Next, I will tell you about the civics trip... we were divided in 5 buses, I knew Justin and Annie, among some other people. yah.. we played cards on the bus, but then Justin and Annie complained of how hard it was to see the cards, so we switched to a normal deck of cards, lol. We split the group in half, and the first stop we made was the Mackenzie house, which was really cool, cause it was supposedly haunted.    Next stop was the police station.. saw someone there.. and yah.. there was a mannequin in the jail, and some girls were like screaming and running away. I was like "oO *nodznodz* what's with the overreaction?" I mean.. it  was  a convincing mannequin, but it wasn't  that  lifelike. Plus it was in broad daylight. Oh.. I didn't manage to get into the police car and get on the police motorcycle thingy.. someone was telling me about the car.. oh, and Orrin was saying how it was cramped in the car (he said he went to the police museum before.. more on that later).   At lunchtime, we went to a mall to eat. I had homemade lunch.. we walked around, and the first thing me and Annie did was to find the others. Surprisingly, we went in the right direction, and in no time, we found Keane and Orrin. Sam and Von joined us later. In the surrounding areas, I also found a bunch of other people who I talked to for awhile... and found someone while walking around.. and we eventually went back, though it was still quite early. Keane was like "I'm late!", but he was misinformed of the time, lol ^^;;   Afterwards, we walked around the old city hall place thingy, where we attended some court trial. The trial, as far as I could tell, was about this guy charged with drug possession, and during his arrest, he lost some money. Now, he's sueing the undercover police for the loss of money. It was interesting, attending a real court trial, though it was much smaller than I had originally expected, and besides the students on the trip, there was no other audience.   At the end, Annie decided to wait at the court house, while I went on to home. I am informed that she was later joined by Orrin, then Keane.    Today after school, I decided to walk home.. it was interesting.. got to talk to Orrin.   S'all for now!   ~Chronos
