I think a lot of it comes from eating the greasy chicken (Lee's) so no more chicken!!   I am thinking of redesigning the website. I want to make it look more like a city. I want to take pictures of signs and photoshop them into Ericville Signs. That is my dream. I also wanna do "A Day In A Life Of Eric" where all day I carry around a camera and take pictures. I think that will be very fun and look neat on the website. Any suggestions for the site? E-mail them to  urlLink eric@ericville.net  or  urlLink ericville_mayor@hotmail.com . I wanna hear from you!  We got out early today. That was so nice. So Al Snow had a press conference at school today. Mr. Spencer asked me to help and I pretty much got out of the school the rest of the shortened day (English and Spanish, then Study Hall) which didn't hurt my feelings, the only thing is I didn't go out for lunch, but I eat a slimfast bar instead which was prob a lot healthier than anything else. I really think I should lose some weight soon. I am in gym class to so I am getting more excerise then normal. When it starts to warm up I want to go joggin more often.  Its not bad out at the lake. If I go right now when it is cold, my throat always starts to bleed and herd. Its not worth that.  That about sums it up for today. Nothing much more to say other than that. Until the next session, your mayor, **ERIC**
