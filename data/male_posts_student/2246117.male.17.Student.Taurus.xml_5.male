Today was not one of those days in which I could completely avoid them.  And it all started with one minor quirk about hair. Hair! Of all things. I mean, if they had caught me having sex or something (not that I am, but the example still stands) at least that would be a decent issue to get upset over.  ... But hair? Please.   For any of you who has seen a picture of me, I have my hair dyed an unnatural blood red shade. Well, it's turing a sort of pinkish-orange shade now, but I digress.  The matter is, my parents have all their relatives and extended family back in China. They're planning on the three of us taking a trip there, in order to visit old friends and relatives. I'm not exactly thrilled with the idea of going there, but I don't really mind it. My parents don't want me to go back with red hair. They want me to dye it black.. Well, I wanted to go away to college with green hair, or another exciting color, so I don't want to dye it black, since that'd be a bitttttch to bleach out.  They threatened to just leave me here and go back themselves. It would be completely fine with me, actually, *IF* the plane tickets weren't bought yet. Instead, it would be a ridiculous waste of money, and I just couldn't allow myself to be the cause of such much waste.  We were trying to compromise, and finally agree that I'll do my hair a medium brown. It's supposed to be all fine and dandy, right?  Right?  Wrong.  Very, very wrong.  My dad says, "IF HE'S GOING TO DO IT BROWN, HE MAY AS WELL STAY HERE." And I had thought we had reached a fucking compromise.  What. the. hell.  Why must they do this to me?
