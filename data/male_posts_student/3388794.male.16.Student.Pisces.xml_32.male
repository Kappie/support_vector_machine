I like the way we could talk about nothing for as long as we want, the way we can stay silent and still feel comfortable.   Nathan and sqeet make me laugh, so i had a good day today, managed to fix my drumkit, and i made only two mistakes in practie, so it was a great practice. considering i didnt know two of the songs. heehee.  love you sqeet.
