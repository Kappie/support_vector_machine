Probables: 7/9 Marquis(8-4, 4.10) v. Maddux(7-6, 4.43) 7/10 Suppan(7-5, 3.35) v. Clement(7-7, 2.83) 7/11 Carpenter(9-3) v. Wood(3-3) *Wood is expected to start, but will not be a sure thing until he meets up with the team in St. Louis.  With the Reds and the Brewers beating up on each other this looks to be an exciting time for the Cards to continue to flourish in the strong Central division.   -CJ
