In other news, some of you may remember a meeper that we had at 1955 N. Sheffield attended by Seth Benson (a friend from Duke) and his girlfriend, Jillian Schwartz (also from school). This weekend in Sacramento Jillian qualified for the Olympics and so is gonna be competing in Greece. Pretty sweet.
