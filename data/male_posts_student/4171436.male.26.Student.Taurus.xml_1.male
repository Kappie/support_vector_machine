I think more than that we need to talk about some general things on saturday ....and really 'start' with the texts (which will be smooth and swift once we have this intro. session) from next week .   What do you think?    And oh ya...I've commented a lot on other posts , please go through them          And yet another thing...the title 'semiology' showing in two lines does not look good to me can you make it appear in one single line or change it to signs or something like that( a shorter name I mean)
