We left it in the middle of the street and it blew up about 5 minutes later with a KABOOM.  Today I feel like crap. I'm tired, I smell and I can't really think straight, but I'm operating fine on the outside.  It's when I have to move or speak, I have trouble.   My dad and I are going to redo my bathroom. We're going to buy paint, and paint it, as well as clean it and install a new showerhead. Yay, maybe we can tape it and send it to This Old House. Or maybe it's This Olde House. Whatever, that guy on it is a beaver.  -Reb
