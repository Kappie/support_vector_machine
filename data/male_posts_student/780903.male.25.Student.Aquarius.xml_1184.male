She was teaching vocabulary to a bunch of kindergarteners in the library, with the Librarian sitting there too, and the word she was teaching was "gigantic." "A tree can be gigantic, a house can be gigantic... can anyone think of anything else that's gigantic?" One of the kindergarteners raised his hand. "Mrs. [Librarian] is gigantic."   I've met Mrs. [Librarian]. And I think this kid belongs in the gifted program.
