Nathan, u should have told me I was an admin, I would have gotten back on!  If anyone sees anyone, tell them Ryan says "hi".  Anyone, that includes the guy at the counter at wal-mart, or that bum that hangs around your house that claims to be your brother\sister, or the guy that picks up the phone when you call the phone-psycic, or that old lady behind you in line for the roller-coaster.  So...Adios, au revior, see ya, chow, later, good bye, and good ridiance.
