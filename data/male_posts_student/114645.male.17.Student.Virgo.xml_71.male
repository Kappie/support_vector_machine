This, getting my Political juices flowing, sent off an email. Here it is.  // From: 'Benjamin Tyra' [benjamin@benlogo.com] Sent: Saturday, July 26, 2003 5:51 PM To: 'Rick Strasser' [rstrasser@kvbc.com] Subject: Tour de France, not Freedom  Mr. Strasser,             I have a problem with you calling the Tour de France, the Tour de Freedom. I understand you may not like the French for not supporting the President with the conflict in Iraq, but referring to a bicycling race that has been going on for over 50 years, and is the most popular bicycling race in the world as the Tour de Freedom is unacceptable. You are a news reporter, and you are supposed to be non-biased in your reporting. Yes, you are entitled to your own opinion, but when you are reporting the sports, as you do, you should not voice your political opinion. The French have not done anything wrong to the United States. They only disagreed with us about Iraq, which they are entitled to do. In fact, if it wasnï¿½t for the French, we would have lost the Revolutionary War and not have gotten where we are today in world affairs. This makes it more unacceptable to change the name of a sporting event with as much tradition as the Tour de France.

I don't feel like you calling my work "unacceptable" is acceptable, however.   Thanks for watching,   Rick //  What do you think? Good? Bad?  urlLink Let me know .
