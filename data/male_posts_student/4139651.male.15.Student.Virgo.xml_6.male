Schwartzenegger(sp)--He's living proof that Republican economic procedure is the way to go. Well, I think that when he's done with his Governorship, he should for Senator against Diane Feinstein, and beat her mercilessly.  The Wild Boys were also on the show. Chris Pontius was like agitating scorpions on his face, but they wouldn't sting him much. Nice Scorpions. Steve-O did a big fiery backflip, which was pretty damn cool.  Can't wait till the RNC!
