I feel some sort of heartbreak everyday, a pain that is so intense that I feel like breaking down. Not going on. I want her to read this, but I am also scared to the fact that she might interpret this in another way than it is meant. It is meant to tell you  that I still like you, I still want to be friends, but I don't want to force you to do anything you don't want. I just wanted you to know how i felt.
