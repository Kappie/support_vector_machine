I've been procrastinating my trip to the studio for weeks now, and - also for weeks now - my looks are growing more and more ridiculous. Usually, the indicator that it's barber-time is when the hair at the back of my head starts to curl. It has been curling for three weeks now.  Thing is, I only have time to go one day a week -and each time that day off is there, I want to  enjoy  it. Thus: procrastination. I could wait another two weeks for my holidays... hmmmm.   I'll never look like Captain Caveman because I am balding, but the longer the locks, the bigger the patch seems. All right!, next Tuesday I'll go.  (I swear one day soon I'm shaving my head -period! With baldness creeping in already - I am 23 so help me God - that doesn't seem like a bad idea at all.)
