Not pot either. Narcotics. She got busted at school because some people told a guidance counselor that they wanted her to get caught because she had a problem. So, in rehap after trying to commit suicide, she got more drugs from all the burnouts there, namely ritalin, she dropped out of school and she cut herself and its infected like woah. WTF does she have to do this. I   Rant over...
