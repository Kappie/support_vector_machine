Ok, the first series was different, it hadn't been seen before and so made a change of regular tv programmes. But did they really have to do it again? Then again? And then 2 more times?!?! It is proably the most pathetic programme I have ever seen; just a group of about 10 people locked in a house for a few months. They're not actors, entertainers, they're just normal people, wanting to have a tiny bit of false fame. Within a few weeks out of the house, I bet no one cares about them at all, and then we start again with a new series. Then they say things like 'I wanted to see if I could handle the challenge' CHALLENGE?!?!?! WHERE IS THE CHALLENGE IN THAT? What I would like to know is why are so many people attracted to watching this junk. And it's not just Big Brother. Things like 'Pop Idol' 'Fame Academy' 'Castaway' 'Survivor' and countless others. They are just normal people! Where is the entertainment value in that? And then I wake up this morning, put the radio on, and what are the presenters talking about? Yep, discussing the people who went into the Big Brother House last night. Well, I for one refuse to watch any of it.  Oh, I also managed to watch about 3 minutes of something called 'How Clean Is Your House?' This was possibly even more pathetic than Big Brother. It featured 2 women going to someones house and... cleaning it! Dun Dun Duuuuuuun! What is the point of such a rubbish programme? Do tv producers really think we have nothing better to do that watch people clean a house? Or in the case of Big Brother, LIVE IN A HOUSE??? And then there's 'The Salon' I've never watched more than about 20 seconds of it, but from what I saw, and from what I've heard, it features.... people getting their hair cut! (which reminds me, I must get mine done this half term at some point) How can people watch that! What is so good about watching what goes on inside a hair dressers? Terrible, terrible... Gone are the good programmes with propper actors... not like the good ol' days...  On another note, I have recently found the lyrics to the Star Wars music 'Duel of the Fates' If you're interested, here they are. Feel free to sing along.  Korah matah korah rahtahmah  Korah rahtahmah yoodah korah Korah syahdho rahtahmah daanyah Korah keelah daanyah Nyohah keelah korah rahtahmah Syadho keelah korah rahtahmah Korah daanya korah rahtahmah   Korah daanya korah rahtahmah Nyohah keelah korah rahtahmah Syadho keelah korah rahtahmah Korah   Korah matah korah rahtahmah   Korah daanya korah rahtahmah Nyohah keelah korah rahtahmah Syadho keelah korah rahtahmah Korah   I think it's a language 'Sanskrit'  Oh, I had my English Literature exam yesterday. It wasn't too bad actualy. And now, NO MORE SEAMUS HEANEY, GILLIAN CLARKE OR OF MICE AND MEN. EVER AGAIN! WOOOOO!!!  I had better do some revision this half term...   Reading:  Nothing, as nonnesuch forgot to bring in a book for me. Fool. Ps, thanks for the last one you lent me :)  Listening to:  Duel of the Fates  Watching:  Last ever 'Friends' last night. Shame about the predictable happy American ending.  Confused about:  Sanskrit  Annoyed with:  Television  Mood:  Slightly annoyed
