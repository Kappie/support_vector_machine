So yes, for all of u who know, u know wat today's song of the tidings of misfortune is gonna be about...for those who dont, close your eyes and get lost, ya bother me!  So yea, the twins are back from bintan, and i just realised my major screw-up...and yes, apparently i made nic cry in the process...  Well, great, now ive got just about the WHOLE FUCKIN WORLD PISSED OFF AT ME! AINT IT GRAND? My god, somebody find me a fuckin wall...i need to bang my head...  Yes, i made a mistake once...that mistake was holding on to my feelings for kim for too long. Y cant i just forget about her, and move on? Y? Y? Y? Wes, thanx for knocking some sense into me man...  Pls kim, now even U think i like u for your looks? WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE GIRL! I know girls ten times prettier than u! If i had wanted looks, id have gone after em long ago...   Now, fine, u dont wanna talk to me, at least listen to wat happened...  Now, remember wat happened at tuition the other day? When  nic told me she had some "mean but essential letter" that she had to send me? Well, I thought that i knew wat it was about...and later found out i didnt...  Girl, u yourself bloody as hell know that i HATE seeing people angry.   U know y i gave u that blasting the other day? Lemme tell u why, if youre not happy about being suspected (if u ever will be), fine TAKE THE FUCKIN MATTER UP WITH ME, dont pin it all on your sis, and let her take the  crap for u!   And now, u know y your sis is cryin? Lemme tell ya why...  After i heard wat someone told me about your sis thinkin that i liked u for all the wrong reasons, ok, put yourself in my shoes here, would u feel so great that youd wanna have a party?   So fine, i made the mistake then, by sayin some stuff which i shouldnt...and ive apologised to your sis for that...  Following that, i thought about wat i thought were the words of your sis, and i realised one thing, she was just trying to protect u, so i realised my mistake back there and then, and apologised to her through an sms. It was after that, that i found out the 2 of u were in bintan...and yet, the next day, i stupidly sent another sms of apology to her...wat i didnt know at the time, was wat i heard was another side of the coin as the actual reason y your sis was pissed...  So yes, i explained it to her earlier in that phone call...and yes, im a fuckin bastard...  If u still dont believe me, ask your sis, and if after that, u still want to ignore me for the remainder of my time on this earth, fine by me...ill respect your decision
