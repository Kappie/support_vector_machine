Now I have to work up the desire to rewrite everything I talked about... if I can remember.  I've noticed lately that people I know have started their own blogs.  The one thing is that they're hosted on Xanga.  Xanga honestly seems like a great community of bloggers who want a complete page for their blog, events, reviews and a guestbook.  This sounds great.  (This is where I begin to sell Blogger)  The main problem with this is that it's all proprietary.  By that I mean that other than changing the theme of the page, you can't change the contents or even have it hosted on a different website.  I can see reasons why they'd do this, but compared to Blogger, it really doesn't measure up.  Blogger allows you to change the layout of the site completely.  You can host it on a different site, or have it hosted on Blog*Spot.  I just think Blogger's better, I guess.  I'm not trying to pick on anyone that uses Xanga or make them think it's the end of the world that they could possibly use such a cruddy service (kidding).  I just don't think it's the best thing out there.  Yup.  I'm getting really tired now.  I wish I wouldn't have blown that post.  I had so much thought in it and there's no way to get it back.  I need to develop a photographic memory.  Then, maybe I won't have to worry about the simple mistake of clicking links while you've got 113423342 lines of blog lined up to be posted.  Wow, I'm tired.
