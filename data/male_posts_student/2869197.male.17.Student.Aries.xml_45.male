As with all things that require mental effort, I resorted to standing around with a dumb expression, waiting kindly to be told what to do. I was told and I did. The world turned and all were pleased.  BSed my way through another essay today, this time critiquing an article on hunting.  No. Just no. Well, my friend and I made a rambuntious attempt to liven up the task, adding recently invented words, repeating title and phrases, and generally breaking the laws of writing and logic with a meat tenderizer.   Well, AP English is a no go. Would you believe the scheduling process started in March? MARCH! How am I supposed to even know what freekin' AP English  is , seconds before I run off to Spring Break? Anyways, as luck (or God, in my ways) would have it, the scheduling system must have changed. A English class turned over into the 1st semester, easing my time table woes. Now all I have to do is get the new Spanish teacher to let me independent study 5th hour. Allow me to rephrase, all I have to do is get the currently middle school Spanish teacher to let me torture her by requiring her to add me to an already brimming class and almost double her teaching needs on the first year of her high school career. Ain't I a prince? *sigh* But what else? What else can I do without destroying my schedule?
