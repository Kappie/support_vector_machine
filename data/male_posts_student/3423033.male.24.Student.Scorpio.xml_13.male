Six years of this shit, I have three weeks to go, and I'm almost willing to just stop now because I am absolutely losing my mind doing pointless group assignment after pointless group assignment. Don't get me wrong, I think I've learned a lot in college, but I'm to the breaking point of pretend life.   I stopped by and looked at a digital piano today. I can feel the music coming back to me now. As all of the frustrations and time consuming details of school are being released, along with the first taste of real freedom coming around the corner, I feel the motivation almost greater than that of high school. It's been 6 long years, but the music is coming back.
