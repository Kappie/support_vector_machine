(2) 80 gig seagates w/ 8 meg caches. load up fedora on one, and hopefully (as i haven't had very much luck with x86 urlLink solaris  in the past, especially when it comes to getting x up and running), solaris 9 on the other. if i get too frustrated with the solaris install... i guess i'll get the latest 5.x release of  urlLink freebsd . in any case... i'd like to get a unix or linux system up with apache, php, and mysql so i can test some web stuff that i'm developing asap.    i think it'd be cool to live in japan... or hong kong... or one of the industrialized asian nations/regions for a little bit. lots and lots of  urlLink toys ...    i found  urlLink this  kinda interesting too... the change in the significance of sundays in the US over the last century. there's been a pretty big shift into a 24/7 lifestyle... which at times... going back to the toys thing... i am a big proponent of toys... but on the other... sometimes i think we're getting too connected to things. sometimes we need to just take it easy... and i find that the more stuff i take on... the more time i need to refocus myself... or i'll just get overwhelmed and break. there'll be days where i'll lay in bed and daydream... longing for a return to a time when tom sawyer had his adventures in mark twain's great novels... or wanting to be a kid again... cause everything was possible and your imagination had no bounds. remember all those stupid games you'd make up with your brothers/sisters/friends? remember all the trouble you got into for your "adventures"? why domost kids want to be older? and many adults want to be younger? i wonder what most people would say their favorite age was. i wonder when i turned from happy tyke to pessimistic old man? i remember i was a pretty happy kid growing up... but as the years went by... that all disappeared. i'd say theyear that that happend was a bad year...    gimme my cardigan... and walker... it's past my bedtime... get off my lawn you lousy kids! =]
