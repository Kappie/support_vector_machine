I don't know, its just that I feel like a lot of people think I am a person who needs to be impressed and that I remember every thing a person does. In all honesty, I overlook most everything a person does that they call 'bad.' I don't know, but I needed to get this out there. I'm really not such a stern person.   But just one more thing, it kills me when people call me "rich" or "perfect." I swear, my stomach tightens up and I get a little bit flustered about that. There's something about living in this shitty "upscale" neighborhood that drives me crazy. People think just because I live in this neighborhood that I'm some stuck-up asshole or something. I hate it, it kills me. Please try to not call me those things. Perfection is disgusting and I am extremely far away from that.  I'm sorry, I've just had a strange day. I'm not directing this message to anyone in specific, but really, just don't call me 'rich.' That is far too negative in the way it is implied. Thanks.
