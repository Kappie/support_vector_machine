Leaning more towards adoption than natural childbirth ("We'd love to have our own children, but we have a heart for kids, and we'd love to adopt"), Simpson pushed theidea that  Newlyweds  mightend soon so that she and Nick could either create or import kids.   But, alas, there's a twist.Recently,  urlLink Simpson wore an Argentinean shawl onMTV .Little news to some, many others took a liking to the accessory, almost tripling the production rate of theshawl's previously struggling factory, which is based in Argentina. So, in a bizarrely hypocritical turn of events, it seems that Jessica went from wanting to adopt a third world child to forcing hundredsofArgentinean boys and girls into child labor three times greater than before her "accessorizing."   It's allalright, though, becausethe stats are with the kids. Apparently, children who are forced into underaged laborhave higher self-esteem than the normal paid worker, mainlybecause theyhave a very small chance of getting fired.
