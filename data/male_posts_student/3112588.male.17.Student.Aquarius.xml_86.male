WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE (for those of you who like it LoL--mwa). it was an OK day today. tim came over, and we wound up going back and forth between "Dude Where's My Car", and deep conversations! hehe! you tell me how that is possible! i have no idea, but we did it, and it worked...i even almost fell asleep when we were talking in my room LoL! im just REALLY tired--but then again, im totally energized...so the second that someone says: lets go!...ILL BE SO ALL OVER IT LoL! i think that tim and i said some things to eachother in the past 2 days that have been very "healthy", as he likes to say. we've discussed things that piss us off about one another...things that we do, that bother each other...and just things that we needed to get out on the table--or, more like, i needed to get out on the table. what is there to fear, but fear itself? well, the answer to that, would be FRIENDSHIPS! LoL! next to jumping off a 150 story building, relationships (or friendships--w/e you prefer) are the scariest things to me. like, i would rather go on "Top Gun" 100 times after eating a chili-cheese burger, than get close to someone--they scare me that bad...just pray for me, once again, for the Lord to comfort my spirit, and dwell inside of me every moment that i live.   a poem that paula sent me...  Sometimes I get lonely and all I gotta do is think of you You captured something inside of me You make all of my dreams come true It's not enough that you love me for me You reached inside and touched me eternally "I love you", best explains how I feel for you...  Because of you, my life has changed, thank you for the love and the joy you bring Because of you, I feel no shame, I'll tell the world it's because of you
