You know what I hate, people who don't share files on WinMX....they just don't get it, your not going to get anything if you dont share. I have a block list of over 100 people who share 0 files and it gets bigger everyday, so I really hope you aren't one of those greedy people, or you get none of my files!   Later, -Haze-
