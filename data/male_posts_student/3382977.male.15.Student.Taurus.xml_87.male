Today i watched The Manchurian Candidate, most of the beginning of Notting Hill, and some of Magnolia (now we are about half way through it). We finished EuroTrip last night and took it back today and got 21 Grams, which is due Thursday, and we havent watched any of it. Magnolia and Notting Hill and My Best Friends Wedding are due tomorrow at 12, so we gotta watch those tomorrow morning. I saw the Village and The Bourne Supremacy also this week. Im hoping to rent Fight Club soon after we get rid of the ones we have. besides movies, there has been a lot of practicing and cleaning going on. my mom seems to bet into a bitchier and bitchier mood everyday...im getting reaalllyyy tired of this Friday Hotel gig. besides that we went to the YMCA at about 8 and did some gym stuff, and then checked out the pool and did some laps and played and stuff. now my eyes sting like hell and my dad has just rampaged into my room after i was supposedly "going to bed". luckily i heard him coming down the stairs. he gave me a little "be more good" speach, probably because my mom just told him upstairs about todays little fiasco this morning with the burner...well, im in bed and its about 9 in the morning and she pops the door open and yells "erik, get up and eat your breakfast which is ready right now...and then go do your practice, etc. ". so i get up and find my food on the stove under some foil, so i figure that everythings off (i didnt really think about it becuase it is always off anyways if moms not there) and eat my breakfast and get to the millions of things my mom wanted me to do. so she comes home and tells me to get all the crap out of the car (she went shopping) and then she comes out yelling that the burner is still on (low enough that my French toast wouldnt burn) and that im very irresponsible and all that jazz.....so im figuring that the days plans are screwed and i might as well go and twiddle my thumbs....but luckily my sister and her friend from Lithuania want to go see a movie so my mom lets me and some people go too. anyway, so thats what started the whole grumpy and bitchy attitude for the day.
