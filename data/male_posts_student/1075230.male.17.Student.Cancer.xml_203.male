My parents haven't found a house yet, so we're at a family friend's house downtown for a while.  ^-^   We left the house on Tuesday and  maaaaan  we were late.  We were packing until laaaaaate into the night even though we were supposed to get out at 2 pm.  We finally got most of it out into trucks (and the rest in the garage) around 12 or 1 in the morning.  And a lot of our stuff was stored in a guys house in Ajax.  Completion...  2:15-2:30?  Arrival at the overnight stay at a friend's near Parkway (and Senator O'Conner) was probably around 3 to 3:30.  I might have slept for 30 to 60 minutes that night.   Last night we went to another place downtown.  That's where I am now.  Oooo... I so tired...    Rei just said to go to bed... >.   Oooooo... Eyes... I'll try to post more often!  ^-^   -ArV   ps.  Today at anime we saw Initial D.  Rei thought it was boring.  I liked it.  I sat on something and my shirt got itchy for the rest of the day.  I think someone swept sawdust into the corner of the video studio... :-s
