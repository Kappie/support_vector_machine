School is almost over.  we are so close to the end of middles school and life is seeming more and more pointless the further we get.  we wander around and try to "acomplish" something.  all it does is just go back and hurt you.  we need to find a point.  or not need a point.  thats what running does for me. or even soccer.  any sport for that matter.  i just want to get away.  gone for a while.  not forever, i couldnt stand that.  i guess i cant have that so i might as well stop dreaming and accept what i have.  wouldnt that be a waste of a life. sitting around waiting for a break from it.  i feel like a skitzo haveing a huge fight with myself.  life is pointless but yet, we have to enjoy it. the only think keeping us from doing that is ourselves.   we chose are life.  yeah there might be some outside factors, but still...we can control where we go and how far.  you can listen to the other crapolio people tell you, but in reality all that does is slow you down.  if you can outgrow that you are on the way to a WONDERFUL life.   just enjoy what you get.  yeah it might not be what you want, but you still have what you need....think about that one.        we sit here trying to think of something deep to say, but really you are the one who makes this as deep as you want it.  you can take what you want and leave what you dont. its all up to you in the end. so now that i'm done telling you what to do with ur life, i'm going to live mine by playing FIFA 98 party
