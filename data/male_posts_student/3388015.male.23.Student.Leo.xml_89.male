Expensive!  2 pancakes were $5.99.  Oi.  I got a turkey club.  We got to the San Diego Seaworld around 12, got our free tickets (I love getting everything free!) and went in.  It was a big park.  We walked around and looked at some of the animals.  Unfortunately, it felt like a zoo, again, so I was sorta disinterested in the information they were giving.    But we got to see a show with sealions, seals, whales, more whales and more animals that live in water.  I got to hold a starfish, feel thirsty all day long (no way was I buying a $6 soda) and take some good pictures.  We went through a shark exhibit, which was really cool.  We went through a tunnel under the tank, so we got to see under the sharks.  Big and impressive teeth.   urlLink    Nola Holding Starfish   urlLink    Shamu the Whale   urlLink    Lovely me waiting for Mom to buy Molly's gift   urlLink    I'm a polar bear!   urlLink    Nola, Aaron  I in front of the ocean  Nola wasn't feeling well, so we planned to leave a little early.  We left around 7 or so, got home around 9.  We stopped at a grocery store and picked up dinner.  Aaron cooked chicken, I made guacamole dip again, and Nola made brownies.  A good dinner.  I'm getting used to staying up late (check the time this was posted).  This isn't good, vacation ends in 5 or so days and I only have a day to catch up!  Make sure you check the below post so you don't miss any details.. I posted several things tonight.
