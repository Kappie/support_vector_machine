My life may be interesting, but not  that  interesting...;)   Well, I had my physical and stuff, it was really   quick and painless  . Jennifer was there, she just showered so her hair was still wet...cuz she had to make sure she was prepared for the big event. The pressure, you know. Excruciating. Tiffany said my brother was paler than her...  and that's saying something  . She, Selena and May are doing badminton, Belinda, Kat and both Charmaines are doing track...not including everyone else taking second years (the list goes forever, I won't even try)...never knew all these people were doing spring sports.  Then dance class...I met Preal (sp?) who's a pretty cool guy...from some   no-name ghetto school called Challenger or something  ...and we're doing 4 recitals at Ohlone in June. Bitch mother. You guys wanna come see me look really dumb? :-D  I detest tutoring.
