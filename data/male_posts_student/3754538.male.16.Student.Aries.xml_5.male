My visiting cousin (age 6) and my younger brother (age 13) are off playing upstairs so I sit down in the family room and begin to watch my movie {rated PG-13 (my cousin cant watch PG-13 rated movies yet)}. My younger brother comes downstairs and is mad that I'm watching the movie without him even though i was the one who rented it for me! so takes the cousin and goes to talk to my mom. She comes and bitches at me about restricting that part of the house from my cousin, who is leaving soon so why cant i wait, and so on and so forth. I leave disgusted and get yelled at by my dad because me younger brother verged on a crying fit when i glared at him {he's 13 remember: a bit old for crying and moaning about every last thing (such as something as minor as your older brother glaring at you)}. After chilling in my room for a little while I walk downstairs to go outside and lo-an-behold! Westley (brother) and George (cousin) are using the TV to play a video game! It wasnt that I was restricting the room from them but that they (Westley) wanted what I had. AND WAIT WHATS THAT GAME'S RATING? TEEN? MUCH LIKE A MOVIE RATING OF PG-13? JUST MAYBE!? so you see... I get bullshited outta watching my movie and yelled at twice because the younger brother can go moaning to mom. I don't blame George (cousin), he tried to say that he didn't even want to use the room before he was told to be quiet by Westley. It was all thanks to Westley and him being a self-centered prick who wants whatever I have or am using. And thanks to him being the youngest brother. My parents help him get everything that he wants, even if its mine. (more to come later probably)
