Moving on, for all those who read the tittle and thought that i had a hard day at school today. you are wrong cos i bunked school today cos i had a very Dizzy mind since i lost my glasses.. I worked over-time today and made so 25 slogans but just a few minutes ago,i found out from ramani that no charts would be allowed to be stuck on the walls and hence i am slighly frusterated cos i really do think that my slogans were great...self boasting ..maybe..haha    Then i read a lot of chemistry today and did some determinants ...7 pages from manjeet to be precise.......    Moving away from all this i am now downloading the yuva songs and for all those who dont know what yuva means...do me a favour and kill yourself.....Well looks like Mr.Manmohan is firmly seated his ass in the new government...how irritating it is to see a congressman take the chair....... Seriouly i am a fella who loves communism .... hates the republicans .... and also hates the democrats....but most of all i hate these congress assholes  Well i know i need to put some more life into my writing cos i dont wanna u guys to read this kindaa bullshit like this blog every day...hence i might as well call it a day...apologies for the small blog today   Philosophy of The Day: "Life isnt a bed of roses....esp when u have a wife...life can then become a knife." G2G Thank U All For Reading I'll see u in hell Luv Santhosh Kumar Lg
