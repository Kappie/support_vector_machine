Thank you....     One day before I leave....     Nothing really happened much, except for the plain fact that I have succeeded in our project, It's damned finish... Whew!     Another thing is that I'll not be doing anything in our project in AP tomorow! Rejoice!     And another thing accomplished today, is that I'll not be seeing that Ms. M, for weeks! Rejoice!     Ever experience riding in a jeepney while eating "spicy pork" from "ERSAO"? Well, if not, then better try it!
