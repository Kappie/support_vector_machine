We all know how much you suck at keeping secrets from me, and I ask that your respect my privacy or else I will sneak into your bedroom at night and take your dolls' heads off..  That's right. My sister possibly found my blog. Apparently she was searching for "Kelleman" this morning, and some sites still have this site with my old e-mail address in their archive, so until then I'm still quite visible. My dad discouraged her from entering it, but who knows whether she'll snoop around later.  It made me realize how much I want her to be able to see this. I want to have a sibling I can be really close to. But a 9-year age difference obviously poses issues, and this site is hardly appropriate for a 3rd grader. I can only imagine how fun it must be for people like Jonathan and Kelly and people who get to have their siblings read their blogs and such. I don't know if I'll ever be able to be close to my sister. We're just too far apart in age. When she's 20, I'll be 29. She'll be entering maturity at a time when I am literally maturing. Not to mention my family doesn't have the greatest history of close sibling relationships.  Maybe thats why I don't feel like I love my sister sometimes. (Okay, a lot of the time) Our relationship is just not one I can understand. I feel more like a third parent to her than anything else, something that drives me insane and causes me to do dumb things that get me yelled at.  I do have respect for her. A lot, actually. I'm possibly the only one who really understands how hard life can be for her, I mean, genetically I have more in common with her than anyone else. And I know how hard it can be being in this family. And she's handling it a lot better than I did. She's having trouble in school too, but she's still trying, she's not going to give up. She has many more friends than I did at hr age, so I'm not worried about her clamming like me. Seriously not an issue with her. She's incredibly smart, as hard as it is for me to accept that. I've always had a hard time dealing with people younger than me just because I require a certain level of intelligence to interact with people without going insane. This makes it hard for me sometimes with her, but when I meet her friends I realize how lucky I am. She may be the brightest and most successful person in the family, I firmly believe. Fitting, as she is the last Kelleman of this generation.  She shares my interest in a lot of things, which is something I really don't appreciate enough. Not only is it not just her trying to be like me (which is what it was when she was younger), she goes out of her way to do things with me sometimes even though she knows she won't enjoy it I think. She's too nice to me. I treat her like crap. I don't know how else to treat her. She gets on my nerves so easily, which isn't fair to her. She has genuine psychological attachment issues (to me, and much more so my mother), and I of all people can't respect that, which is pretty low of me. But it leads into my fault, which is an inability to adapt to various social situations.   She's very cute, and I hope and believe she'll be very beautiful when she grows up. I sometimes dream of the day when she's married with children, and I look forward to being there, if she lets me. I sometimes have guilt that I have no intention of carrying on the family line (I have the name, and I do have family pride, I just mask it under disgusting levels of modesty), and I want to be there for her and her family when the day comes. Maybe we can be one of those families that lives near each other, and can see each other from time to time. Believe it or not, that's not too common in this family. My closest direct relatives live in Chicago, and we don't talk to them.  Hmm...sorry for this random tangenting that is this whole post, but I think I finally understand how I want to be a family. I want us to be close. I want to avoid all the fall-outs that seem to be inevitable in this family. I would never say this in front of my parents (especiallly not my mother), but I have incredible respect for my Grannie F, who still to this day tries to repair her family. My mother is right, Grannie was probably a large factor in what caused it all to break (what with her OCDish perfectionism? NO WAY!), but she hasn't given up. What can I say? Stubbornness is very much a family trait.  That must be why Grannie has trouble with the in-laws. My mother is perfectly content living in a dysfunctional family; she did it her whole life, and barely cried the day her own mother passed away. It seems so easy to see that keeping those old traditional family values is archaic and too much unnecessary hard work, but I think everyone in this family (Hey, everyone period. Everyone has got some black sheep in the family, right?) knows how much we need each other. We may drive each other crazy, but we all know on some level that it's because we're reflecting our own faults. Better for us to stick together and drive each other crazy than to split and be alone. People in general are meant to be in a family, but we are especially I suppose. We have things that bring us together (and in turn apart), things about us that only we can understand. And most importantly, we do have pride for the family. We care when someone accomplishes something. We look out for one another, and we don't criticize other peoples lives because we dislike them, but because we honestly think they can do better.  Warning:Dumb Pseudo-bragging  We're very smart people. We can accomplish a lot. My aunt's a film professor, my dad's a high-ranking engineer of computer science. My grandpa chairheaded a project to renovate the specifics of some NASA rocket thing I know little to nothing about. My grandma was the first woman in the family to graduate from college, and on the flipside my uncle is very successful without ever having graduated from college. My 2nd cousin is a marine photographer, who apparently is well-known enough that my last name was recognized by a guide on a whale watch. That was mainly just weird though.  And we have to put up with a lot. Doing work isn't easy for us. All three siblings of my dad's family had intense difficulties in college. My uncle never finished, my father was almost kicked out, and my aunt switched schools several times. My great-grandfather commited suicide when my grandfather was only 13, the first of many he would see throughout his life.   We understand each other. I like to think so at least. To other people we appear lazy, or just plain challenged. Maybe we are, in a weird way. But we don't think so. It's an awfully big relief to know that your family has faith in you. I know so many people who don't get trust from their family, and that's the one thing I get in spades. We may drive each other up the wall, but there is something going on there that's just unsaid.  So my family needs each other. And I know none of my parents' generation will do it. And my Grammie is still trying, but she won't succeed. But I want to be the one who tries. It could be difficult, to say the least. While I get along quite well with my uncle's children, they live so far away that we hardly know each other anymore, and aren't that close. My aunt's children on the other hand, I haven't seen in at least five years. Actually, I haven't even met the "newest" one (She's three I think). So it's not going to be easy for me to get up in 20 years and try to form a bond with people I've never even really spoken to. But I pledge to do it. Because more than anything else, I believe this family will apart in a second without someone holding it together. And I want to hold it as long as I can.  Because I'm a pussy who needs support from others. If any of you read all that, I apologize. It was mostly for me I think. Writing on here makes me start thinking about things I really should think about more often.
