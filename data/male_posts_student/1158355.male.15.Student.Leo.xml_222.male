The AP Euro exam is over though I did bad on it, I'm so glad it's done with and so is NYSSMA so the rest of the year is a breeze except stupid regents which will be easy compared to this exam I took which I didn't even get to finish the multiple choice questions...80 questions in 55 minutes?! BULLSHIT! This fucking world expects too much from us. Ya well you can thank the Asians. The Asian youth is rapidly and since the Asians are hella smart, they make school harder. Maybe I enjoy being ignorant, ok? Damnit I want to be Asian. Oh yea, the other day's post of that song, at the end everything becomes all happy and peaceful, WHICH SHOULD OCCUR IN THIS WORLD! Hopefully with our future technology it will. Anyways, I'm glad the stress is done with and now I can go back to the regular school routine. School, homework, drums, sleep, and again and again and again until the summer when I'm gonna have drums, friends and a job. But maybe without the job, considering I want this summer to be relaxed and free. Maybe I'll work with Mike caddying. Or perhaps Brooksite pizza place down the street or maybe at Stop and Shop or Walbaums. I need to turn 16 also. And I also need to become a professional drummer. Yea, that's all, this weekend should be good. Now here are some great links.  The  urlLink British  can help you with your homework.
