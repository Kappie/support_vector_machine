I will start off by first mentioning my progress with OCD. After another doctor visit, I have been uped to a 50 MG dosage. I have been taking that for more than a week with no side effects. I still ask questions about stuff, but I seem to spend less time dwelling on it. I haven't asked if my chicken strips from Wendys are fish or anything like that. How one could not know the difference between chicken and fish is beyond me... Cut me some slack here.  Lately, I have been hanging with the kids uptown. Riding my skateboard or my bike around town. The kids uptown are Seth (real name is Isiah), Jordan, Dylan, and Zack. Sometime Kaitlyn will be riding her bike uptown and stop and hang out with us. We never converse however, because her mom is my Uncles ex wife. Funny isn't it? I never talked to her when we were "cousins" either though. She has no blood relation to me, so whatever.  Some incidents that you might find interesting have happened since my last post, so I'll share them with you. The first one that comes to my mind happened just recently. I saw some girl standing outside the Ice Cream Shop, so I rode my bike up to the shop so I could see what she looked like. Well, as I was close to her Seth yelled "Scott, is she hot?" Embarassing and funny in its own right. The gang skated up to the shop and we all were just hanging out there. The girl got in a Blazer and it went around the block and went past us again. As they were right by us, they came to a near stop. The girl was sitting in the passenger seat and smiled. Then they drove away out of sight. I need to start finding out girls phone numbers, because I'm sick and tired of letting them slip through my fingers and out of my life.  An exciting posibility has made itself known to me. My friend Tim might move back to Indiana. You see, Tim and I were best friends for years in grade school before he moved to Texas. Although we didn't keep in touch as much as I thought we would, we still remained friends. He came back up for freshman year, but he ended up moving back to Texas. I left highschool to get homeschooled that same year, before he moved. Well, his dad told him he is moving back up to Indiana. Tim doesn't know if his dad will follow through with it though. If he does that would be cool. One interesting concept about him moving back is the possibility of being able to work out. All my friends up here are lazy and don't care about their appearance. Me on the other hand, would like a six pack and bulging biceps. Tim works out, and he said he has the same problem down in Texas. I never work out, for the very fact I just stated. I need someone like Tim, who isn't lazy, to spot me. Maybe, I'm not sure about this yet, but just maybe I could start taking Taekwondo again. Tim might be able to keep me motivated and having someone along for the ride would make it go by faster (its a 30 minute drive). It would be even cooler if Tim gets homeschooled, then we could work out in the morning and cruise for chicks after school gets out. Oh man, the possibilities are endless. I haven't had a friend that I could just hang out with all the time like I used to.  Last, but not least. Is the altercation I was envolved in. Well, Seth and I were playing basketball and these stupid little kids, which I have had problems with before came up and were harassing him. They were claiming that he gave cigerettes to their little brother, who is only 9, and was with them. I defended him and asked the kids what the whole deal was. I mean, even IF he did, the kid took them. Well, one of the bitch sisters stole my basketball and ran home with it. Her twin sister, Calista, which I have mentioned before in my posts, told her to give it back. Calista likes me I guess, because she was on my side. Anyway, so now my basketball had been stolen. Well, Brent and Mike rode up on their bikes and we were telling them about all the shit that was going down. The four of us rode our bikes up to their house and demanded that they give my ball back. There mom made them get it while she proceded to threaten us. "Don't give my kids alchohol, drugs, or cigerettes or I'll blast you." Seth says "I didn't give them cigerettes. Then Brent tells her that her stupid kids were throwing rocks at his house. She tells us that they will be dealt with and goes inside. The bitch that stole my ball tosses it as us and Brent says Thanks. She says "Jackass" and goes inside. (lol) Mission Complete.
