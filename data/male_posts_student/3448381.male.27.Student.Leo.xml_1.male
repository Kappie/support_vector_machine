I think it's pretty much understood that creativity makes this world just a bit much more enjoyable.  We escape our mundae lives into different forms of creativity.  Movies, music, books, dancing...each of those creative endeavors builds on past traditions.  So why are multimedia companies trying to destroy the future?  They key element to involved with the distribution and usage of ideas is wrapped up in intellectual property (IP).  When I create an idea, it is my intellectual property.  A song, a poem, a picture...all intellectual property.  Man made laws have been created to protect the creator of these works.  People cannot use your creations without your permission.  Sounds fair doesn't it?  I wouldn't want people claiming they wrote something when in reality I wrote it...or would I?  Maybe if I was the type of guy that thought someone else can improve on what I created, then I wouldn't have a problem with someone else using it.  As long as it grew and became something else.  Taking in something that exists, transforming it, and (re)producing it is the basis for Hiphop conciousness, my first CD "food for thought", my second CD "It aint the coffee in my kitchen", all works based or influnced by past works (basically all art), and a new CD i'm working on tentatively titled "It's the soundtrack to this moment: Monkey Magic".  As I said in the liner notes of "It aint the coffee...", the english language has many words which are reused everyday in different contexts.  Why can't IP be used in the same decontextualized way?    There's so much more to this idea of Intellectual property.  My thoughts are a little sporadic right now and hopefully grad school well help me refine what I'm thinking.  Creativity is being stifled.  For a glimpse at some of the work being done in this area I encourage you to go here:    http://creativecommons.org/  I believe what has prompted me to write a little something about this idea is that I have seriously started thinking about ideas for this new CD.  I would love to make a website for all these CDs, put the tracks up on the web and have people download, distribute, and discuss the ideas and topics.  But I can't because they are completely illegal because they are all sampled based.  I am afraid of the legal reprecussions of using someone's creations without thier permission.  What a shame.  The CD will be made and as with the other CDs, only a few copies will be made and handed out to our friends and family.    More on these ideas in the future...  /Chaunsee
