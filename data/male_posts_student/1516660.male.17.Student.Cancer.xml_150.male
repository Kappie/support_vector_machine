This is where it determines if we get into the JC for the 1st 3 months or not. I am hoping to score well in this exam.  Alright, lets start from Monday. On Monday, I had E-Maths 1 and SS. I spent too much time on two questions during E-Maths, thus, I have no time to do the last question. And I know some more. Sigh!! Basically, this is an okay paper.  But SS was easy!! Very very easy! HaHaHa! I did the question on conflict and diplomacy with ease. Source-based very easy too. Ahh!! After the exams, I went home with Janet.  In the afternoon, after lunch, I began to study for my Chemistry. Actually, there are two papers on Tues. Chem and A-Maths. But Chem comes first. I studied along with Wendy. My strategy for studying is read textbook first, then notes. Sometimes, I just referred to the notes, as for those chapters, Mrs Chew did not use the textbook. I also taught Wendy all about the chapter in Organic Chem. I hoped she understood what I taught her. I went to bed without even studying for A-Maths.  Tuesday - Ahh! It was a very easy paper for Chem. As usual, it was set by Mdm Rekha. And as usual, she was very protective of her Sec 5s, so she set an easy paper. Why should I be complaining? HaHa! I would like a challenge every now and then, you know. Mrs Chew set challenging papers. I did all 3 Structured Essays. Actually, I chose the first 2. But seeing I got about 30 minutes left, I did qns 3 on the question paper itself. And it turned out my question 3 seemed to score much more for me than 2 (I don't know how to explain "unsaturated" in question 2). So, I asked for another paper and copied down what I wrote in the question paper. And I managed to smuggle out question 2, which I will be correcting when Mrs Chew goes through the answer (see how well I can do for the topic ma!!). And ayiah! A-Maths was horrible. And while doing, a horrible feeling came to me. I got very scared. I realized that I am gonna flunk my A-Maths, and I don't want! I need A-Maths for JC!! Sigh. This tells me that I am gonna put in a lot of work on Sunday for A-Maths. Oh well.  After that, I rushed down to meet my parents, who will be driving me to Woodlands Central to eat. We met SL outside and we gave her a free ride to her uncle's funeral. I ate the hor fun my mom recommended. Ahh! It was very nice! I am gonna try the ti meen some other time. Then, my mother shopped for a wallet for brother. My mother said "My son only likes a particular type of wallet" and the uncle thought I was the "son". He said "Young children don't be so fussy hor. Try this wallet". I looked at him and said, "I am not the one who's buying....". He said "oh!". Then, we went home. I studied History for about an hour. Only 4 chapters to study....so easy. Then, I went online to relax. At night, I watched Brainiest Kid. Perry Lam won. I thought Jose would win (He screwed because he didn't guess the keypad game's answer fast enough). But Perry's smart. Good good! After that, called Wendy to teach her Vectors. We chatted for a while. Then my mother called Uncle Steven! She asked him to buy A CD-Writer for me (of course we will pay him later,. We asked him to buy because he's a computer expert ma!)!! YaY!! Can finally burn CDs le! I am starting with my Charmed movies! YaY!! Uncle's coming after he brought the burner! Can't wait. And I am upgrading my memory card and my disk space after he come over to look at my computer's specs. Possibly the video card too, because I want to play Sims 2 when it comes out. I don't think I am changing to Windows XP. Very unstable, always getting virus here and there. After that, called Wendy and chatted. We went to sleep later.  Wednesday- E-Maths 2 was kinda easy too. I only lost about 15 marks. Not bad. I might get a B3 this time. Or if I am lucky, an A2. Meow!! History's next! And oh boy! Was it another easy paper! I was set on doing communism, but they asked to explain how "competition with USA" made Gorbachev come up with Perestoika and Glasnot. I didn't do because I am afraid I would get the explanation for given factor wrong. And that's not good. So I did the question on Germany instead. Quite easy la, that one. Source-based's fine too. On the easy side. I am confident of getting at least an A2 for Combined Humanities. Of course, I shouldn't set such high expectations. Later I get dissappointed how?   After that, we (me, CQ, XC, HuiMin, Amanda, SL, HL, Gloria, Janet and YC) went to Causeway Point to eat. Luckily I ate the chicken noodle thingy. This week would be the last week they are selling chicken noodle, because the popularity for this noodle is not good. Sigh!! Good food wasted. Then, we went home to study Bio. It took me all day (between an unexpected nap lasting for an hour) to finished Bio. I read the last chapter in-between commercials of Charmed (oh my!! Barbas is sooo evil!!). I also made Wendy angry that day. I was complaining about using other bottles, because Mom brought me one . I was saying that I am gonna be embrassed and all, because I believe using drink bottle is NOT harmful. And now, I am doing something which is against my will. I also said something about my annoyance with ultra-hygienic freaks and how they offended me. Somehow, Wendy got angry. And didn't talk to me for about 2-3 hours. I think she cooled down already, because she said "bye" to me. Oh well. I feel so guilty.   Thursday- Bio Paper 2! Oh my my! It was a moderately easy paper. Yeah. I am so proud of my first long essay question. I wrote so neatly and everything! I did the "OR" question, about artificial and natural selection. Quite an easy paper la. After that, we went to Causeway Point to eat. I ate porridge, century egg and chicken porridge to be exact. Without ginger, onions, or spring onions to be even more exact. After that, I shopped for Angel present. CQ came online, and so did WQ. WQ tagged along, more like. Supposed to me and CQ one. Sigh. Cannot talk freely le. I took a big gamble and brought a CD I hoped my mortal don't have. After that, we went home to study for Physics.   I went to Wendy's house to study for Physics. HaHa! We cooked, no no, fried, luncheon meat. First time man! We had difficulty using the can opener, but I found out how to use it, after a long while of fitting the opener here and there. At first, we put int oo much oil and used the wrong pan. We settled for a wok and some oil. I must say, the luncheon meat was nice! :) After eating, we studied for Physics. After a while, I got very very tired. We decided to sleep for 30 minutes. I slept on her bed, while she slept on her mother's bed. After the short nap (went pass so soon! so tired leh!!), we continued studying Physics. We also talked quite a big. About the Angel-Mortal game. About what we are gonna do for celebration after Tuesday's paper. We are planning to eat at Swensen's. The Earthquake ice-cream! I finished at 5.50 something. At 6, I went home.   On the way home, Wendy called. She found out who's her angel is. It's....me! Opps! I made a slip-up by putting the CD in her bag after she checked. But that's not the problem. I brought her a CD she had already. Linkin Park's Meteora. I thought it was quite new you know. That goes to show my knowledge on music industry. Sigh! She was sad. I mean, her surprise's spoilt. I felt so guilty. Sigh! I should have asked for another 10 cent coin from Ji. I should have brought the Angel cards at New Age Circle instead. Sigh. We aare gonna exhange it for Hotel Paper today. I wonder if Popular allows that. She volunterred that she exchange, since I was afraid of embarrassment ("That idiot say it's embarrassing, which I dun have a clue what's so paiseh about"). I felt so guilty about letting my mortal do my dirty job. I said I would try doing it instead.   Today- Ah! Science Paper 1 is such a failure. I got so many wrong for Chem! I felt like I am such a big failure. Sigh!! Physics I was like going "oh die liao!". I mean, the short answers were quite okay la. Not very easy, but not that difficult either. The structured essays is such a killer! A lot I don't know! I finally had to make a choice of doing the 1st two questions. I have no clue about magnetic induction, so I didn't choose the last qns.   Just now, we went to exchange the CD. I freaked out at the last minute and let Wendy change for me. So si bai, KY. Spineless idiot. But luckily, she managed to exchange it for Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper, which I am listening to right now. So nice the CD! :D Thanks Wendy!   I think after this, I am playing FFIX. I am gonna get all the Chocobo's Treasures first, then levelling up to 99, before advancing the story. Yep! So, gotta get going now. See ya tomorrow blog!
