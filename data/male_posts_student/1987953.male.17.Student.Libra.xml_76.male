"CTI" stands for " C hristian  T een  I ssues". Hopefully we will turn into a forum in time, and it won't just be us four (Me, Colin, Steve (AKA Mark) and Kari).   Well, um, I get my license soon. I've now hit highway driving. I went up to about 65 mph, and drove on Rt. 40 (Pulaski Hwy.), Rt. 152 (Mountain Rd.), Rt. 24 (Vietnam Vets Mem. Hwy.), and Edgewood Rd. I'm getting good.   Also, the new Wendy's at which I work just had the Grand Opening on Saturday. Billy Ripken (Cal Ripken Jr.'s brother) was there, Tom Davis (national sportscaster), and our councilman Dion Guthrie. It was fun.   Well that's all that's really going on. Read the lyrics to the song down below. A lot of the same aspects discussed in it are things I learned from Brittany, and now I feel okay to release the first of the two country songs that have gotten me over Brittany and taught me a lot. The second comes tomorrow.  In Christ, Mike >   urlLink Hear this song now!     Back of the Bottom Drawer  by Chely Wright   In the back of the bottom drawer  Of the dresser by our bed  Is a box of odds and ends that I have always kept  But the man who sleeps beside me  Doesn't know it's even there  Little pieces of my past  That I shouldn't have to share   A napkin that is stained with time  Has a poem on it that didn't quite rhyme, but it made me cry  In a 'Dear Jane' letter from a different guy  He broke up with me and he told me I'm not always right  And a stolen key from an old hotel room door  In the back of the bottom drawer   I don't keep these things 'cause I'm longing to go back  I keep them because I want to stay right where I'm at  I'm reminded of my rights and wrongs  I don't want to mess this up  But I wouldn't know where I belong  Without this box of stuff   A birthday card from my first boyfriend  He signed it 'I love you' so I gave in  Yeah, we went too far in his daddy's car  And those Mardi Gras beads from '98  We danced all night, stayed out so late  We thought we were stars, closing down the bars  That champagne was cheap but still I've got that cork  In the back of the bottom drawer   I'm not trying to hide these things from the man I love today  But I'm a better woman for him, thanks to my yesterdays   So now I try to give more than I take  And I bite my tongue, fight the urge to say it's my way  Or no way at all  And now I cherish love a whole lot more  'Cause of what's  In the back of the bottom drawer
