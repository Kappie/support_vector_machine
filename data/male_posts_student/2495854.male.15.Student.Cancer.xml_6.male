Everybody needs a second chance. -Loverboy, "Working For The Weekend"   oi.. the end of the summer.. so depressing. august got me addicted to soap operas and text messages. all my children is a really good show for a soap opera. they deal with situations like everyone else. but yeah.. i got over it when school started. my new cell phone tho... that was a big deal. i added every body i knew in, and i mean EVERYBODY.  august is also when i met bryan. he’s really funny but kinda sensitive... anyway, we got to noe each other and yeah.. we were friends.  ooo~ august was the month of the family summer trip. yay hawaii! the trip was a lot of fun, but i wish we spent more time on maui! i was just starting to get a good tan! anyway... we stayed at this really fancy hotel and i met a lot of guys.. you noe me.. :-D my aunt wendy lives in hawaii and i spent a lot of time with her too (no, not kalie’s mom wendy. wendy from my dad’s side)  one night my aunts wendy, debbie and norma and my uncle took us out to dinner at the outback. it was CRAZY~ norma and debbie got drunk and hit on waiters and this one guy hit on ME! plus the scary bus boy watched me potty. and i think the bartender was drunk too.   anyway.. i read a lot of books. the required reading for the Humanites academy was awful. bleh~  i got back on thursday the 14th. the day.. jamie’s mom passed away. this meant jamie would be leaving for washington (the state).. in less than a week..  on sunday the 17th i got a phone call from my “Link Crew Leader” telling me about orientation. lol. i knew from his voice that he was gay.  the orientation was 20th. and of course, nathalie left town the day before.   i picked up ellen, kalie and teena and we drove to soquel. orientation was crazy. my coming out had spread like wild fire. all the shoreliners knew. after a short speech from the president and vice president (my GAY link crew leader) we split into link groups.  the only shoreliner in my group was cloey, but that was enough. we talked about our summer and our ex’s. my link leader was RC (like the soda!). and this other girl... we played a game where we had to remember everyone’s name.. it was fun.   there was one girl in my link group. she was talking about biology and geometry and the humanities academy.. but i didnt remember her from the meeting. when we got closer to school i found out her name was nelli. everyone ran up to her and gave her hugs and she seemed mucho popular. i wanted to be her friend. lol. pathetic, i noe.  after link crew we took pictures. mine SUCKED! probably cause that guy keep telling me to turn my body. OMG! get this! his name – Harry Dong. lmao. well after pictures we got schedules and lockers. locker 2 – 96. everyone one with us got lockers around us. it was really cool.  i looked over my schedule. great. i had a 7:40 class. oh well. not that bad. after we were sure that all 6 of us- me, kassie, kalie, ashlee, teena and ellen- could open our lockers we headed to the parking lot and left. all in all the orientation was fun. oo! i met a guy named stuart saepia. none of us knew he would be kassie; first kiss.  after orientation we went back to my house and watched chicago. it was fun. we sand and danced. speaking of dancing, after the movie we played DDR. but yeah. i had to kick everyone out cause it got late.  that night i was talking to dominic about RC. he asked his ex-boyfriend jack and then jack IMed me and we talked. he seemed really cool.  the last weeks of summer all happened way too fast. the last saturday was kalie’s birthday party. kathleen and i got her CD’s. the party was so much fun. besides kathleen, naomi and lianna were also there. plus kalie’s boyfriend. woo hoo. lianna is kalie’s short but funny friend. she’s tons of fun.  around 5 nathalie called from her trip. i sat down and i started talking to her. the conversation lasted 3 hours. lol. at 8 she left to watch the cheetah girls. she wished kalie a happy birthday and.. blah. it was over.  sunday (the next day) was awesome times 50! it was the day of sally’s birthday. janis, matt, teena and sarah rorvick were there so was tina liang!   ive known sally since 7th grade. shes really athletic. lol.  tina is the coolest girl ever! her and nathalie were my best friends over the summer and they still (more or less) are. tina and matt got in this huge food fight during the party. it was great.  after ,we went back to sally’s house and jumped into her pool. it was awesome. tina wouldnt get in tho.. but i almost pushed her in once or twice... but then she pushed me in... yeah.. good times.  the last day of summer i went shopping (duh!) we saw harry and amy and tessa too! it was so much fun, you have no idea!  but nothing lasts forever. and the summer that i loved so much came to an end.  i went to bed early, but i didnt fall asleep for hours. i couldnt stop thinking about school. oi.  -Brandon!! see yaa
