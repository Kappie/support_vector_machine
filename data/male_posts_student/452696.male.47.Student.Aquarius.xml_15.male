I could go out and get a job and work part time. At what though? I don't just want to work to fill a disposable income void. Maybe I should though 'cause the matrix has me and I'm making payments on my Visa again. Ahhhh screw it.  A woman I worked with phoned me two days ago to tell me that the projects that had been artificially delayed by the pusillanimous poobah that gave me grief near the end of my tenure had finally pushed ahead. Great! I really didn't know how to respond. I'm really happy this organization will finally embrace technology that has been readily available to the average 16 year old for some time now? I feel pretty much like a failure. What could I have done about it? Nothing really. The ability to move technology ahead in that organization is always left up to the master debaters.  I'm the people that needed to get going on projects that had been debated extensively for 5 years. Learning. Training. Effective communication.
