The events which we did participate in were Gaming, Web Designing and Senior Programming. Souvik could not make through the qualifiers of the Gaming event due to keyboard problems. The game was Unreal Tournament and the frag limit was just 10.  Vansh and Rasagya were declared third in the Web Designing event. Swati and myself won the Senior Programming. We did not think we could have won the programming event as the last (fourth) question we had to do was to make an analog clock with the hour, minute and seconds hand. The clock had to work i.e. show the time. Neither of us (me and Swati) had any idea about graphics in C++, but with the C++ help file we were able to make a pretty nice clock which worked! As we were the only ones who had got all the questions right, we won. I don't think there was a trophy for the overall winning school.
