I think anime is not good for the United States, not good for here. Japan should stay in Japan (cartoons not people). Who knows, maybe in a new anime show, there's a sadistic repeating kitten saying "fuck off" in japanese, then, kids start doing it. Then they yelled at by a japanese guy. Its a cycle, really, creators make the cartoon in Japan, wait a few years, dub it, send it to the US, put it on a TV channel, wait a few months, make trading cards out of it, make the merchandise, put children in a fantasy world, the children tell their parents, the parents buy the cards and merchandise, it goes on for a year or less, the parents stop buying it, then the creators get unemployed, kill themselves, and another guy continues it, it craps out, then another anime craze comes on other than that one. Same as Poke'mon, Yugi-Oh! is too.
