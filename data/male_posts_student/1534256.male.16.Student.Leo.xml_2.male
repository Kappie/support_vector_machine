WEEEEEEEEEE!  Until tomorrow, when I have a German Oral. Karl Marx würde in 1818 in Berlin geboren... I'm not stopping for brevity, I'm stopping because that's how much of my presentation I know. Bugger. Néanmoins, I'm feeling pretty good at the moment, as you can imagine. And then on Wednesday, when I've agreed to keep Adam company before his Drum lesson. But then comes Thurday, filled with its Chinese Aromary goodness, huzaaaah!  Saviour of the Universe!  Ohohoho, wonderful...  Not forgetting, of course, that I'll be going back to STRS in September, because it's the best school in the world. No debate.  Anyway, all you peoples who have to go to school until July, ahahahahahahahahah adinfinitum , Scott.
