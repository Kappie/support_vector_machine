I waltzed into the outlet, feeling particularly secure with myself (I haven't been wearing my glasses for 2 days because I'm beginning to feel that I look better without them on), and so I went up the stairs for my optical examination, closely trailed by my mother.  I tried to have a cup of tea when the optician, a fairly short man with dark skin and a strange American-English accent, walked in, leaving me with no option other than to bin the cup of tea I had just made myself from the machine. It wasn't as if it was particularly aesthetic, as it had powdered milk, but I had been thirsty for quite some time. After some abroo-ha-ha with the Optician, I put my hat back on and went downstairs to choose some frames (my prescription had changed enough to warrant a new pair of glasses) from the budget lines. After about 5 minutes relentless searching (with various calls of "put THOSE back" from my ever-traditional mother), I found a normal-looking pair which I then got fitted. A cute Anglo-Indian girl of about my height then served us, checking the prescription form for any errors. Unfortunately, the Optician had left off my pupil length from the records. So, up the stairs I went, this time leaving my mother behind and going with the cute girl. A different, very English, optician took my pupil length in a matter of seconds and soon the prescription was complete. I have  to go back and collect my new glasses at 2:00... a little too descriptive, no? Seriously, I'm impressed if you've managed to wade through all that.  I'm pretty tired and the lack of glasses is becoming disturbing for my eyes...  Ah, and I'm learning JavaScript a bit. I did about 8 hours worth of lessons in about 3/4 yesterday and it's a 24 hour book, so in total it should only take me about 15 hours to complete, I reckon (calculated by the fact that the later chapters cover more difficult topics).  Anyway, I'm going to walk into town in a bit. See you later.  Love, Jon Roskilly
