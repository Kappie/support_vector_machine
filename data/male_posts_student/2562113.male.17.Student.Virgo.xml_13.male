Haha, it's getting later and later!  Went to the mall today with Chris, Ed, and Dan. We had absolutely no reason to go there except to fuck with the innocent public. Chris really caused a ruckus this time. He's good at it because he knows how to keep a straight face in any situation, so people never know if he's kidding or not.  After the mall we all chilled at Ed's house for a little while. We chilled with Ed's cousin, she was cool. Ed's dogs are mad funny. His golden retriever is so bad that they're forced to keep it in the bathroom for the fear that it will destroy every piece of furniture in the house. Even in the bathroom it manages to chew the toilet flusher knob. LOL.  Justin just showed me some revealing pictures of Britney Spears from a recent photo shoot. Man, she is so FUCKING hot. She might as well just take off all her clothes since she pretty much wears nothing during her photo sessions anyway. "Imagine one night with her." :)  -BIGsmut.
