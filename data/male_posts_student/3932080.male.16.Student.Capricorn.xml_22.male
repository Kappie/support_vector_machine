We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.    Producer #7: Scott Storch    00000000000     Write Up  Introduced to the world subtly as the keyboardist on the  Roots’  1993 release  Organix,  Scott Storch has since become a popular hitmaker, his productions trademarked by synth beats and dazzling ivory struts. That keyboard work on  Organix  lead to a permanent spot as the Roots’ pianist, which in turn pushed Storch as the hottest handyman in the world’s tightest hip-hop band. Years later, he started to see work beyond the Roots, collaborating with such veterans as  Dr. Dre , with whom he crafted some of his most memorable work (especially the #2 hit “Let Me Blow Ya Mind” for  Eve  and  Gwen Stefani , a brilliant genre-defying sass attack that did wonders for both ladies’ careers). Storch soon abandoned his rap-only tag by dicing out some pop hits as well, working with  Christina Aguilera  and, most notably,  Beyoncé . Although Storch did have some initial stumbles (repetitive tracks that went nowhere on the charts), he rebounded immediately and now rarely misses with his hits. Actually, by late 2003, Storch had moved away from his keyboard-heavy jams in favor of elaborate dance tracks, a strategy that paid off extremely well (as Storch saw his first #1 hit in  Beyoncé  and  Sean Paul’s  “Baby Boy”). Now an experienced producer, Storch seems only to get stronger and funkier with age, almost reversing the thought of retirement in lieu of loading the Billboard charts with hit after hit. In terms of winning the  Producer(s)   Grammy , Storch needs to pump out a few more radio tracks to be noteworthy, but that’s something that the keyboard virtuoso just may be capable of.   History and Mentionable Tracks Timeline (followed by Billboard charting)  Starting out in the early nineties, Storch’s productions seem to grow more abundant every year, a stat that points to his rising popularity and work ethic.  1999:   Still D.R.E. - Dr. Dre   (#93)   Family Portrait - Pink   (#20)   2001:   Let Me Blow Ya Mind - Eve feat. Gwen Stefani   (#2)   2002:   Tarantula - Mystikal   2003:   Thug Luv - Lil’ Kim   Clap Back - Ja Rule   (#44)   Me Myself  I - Beyoncé   (#4)   Fighter - Christina Aguilera   (#20)   Poppin’ Them Thangs - G-Unit    Career Blotches   Can’t Hold Us Down - Christina Aguilera feat. Lil’ Kim   (#12)  Supposedly the first hip-pop crossbreed to fight for women’s rights, Christina Aguilera’s “Can’t Hold Us Down” (which milked the “Lady Marmalade” collaboration by guest-spotting Lil’ Kim) was bloated with double-standard defying lyrics and a less-than-fitting rally cry: “Can’t hold us down!” Unfortunately, Christina Aguilera (past lyric: “I wanna get dirrty”) and Lil’ Kim (graphic lyric: “I make a Sprite can disappear in my mouth”) are much more  Thelma  Louise  than  Elizabeth Stanton  Susan B. Anthony , meaning that they speak to female empowerment by sexuality, not to female righteousness by protest. On top of that, Scott Storch gave the duo a beat that sweats and grinds with post-coital bell lines and thrusting guitar spikes, sounding like the last thing you’d want to loop beneath a feminine chant. More rowdy than rebellious, more galvanizing than groundbreaking, this flawed anthem combined all the wrong things at all the wrong times and spoke to little more than sexiness.   X - Xzibit   (#76)  Looping piano jumbles, synth lines, and string stabs, Scott Storch gave Xzibit one hell of a lackluster first single to his 2000 third release,  Restless.  Working with  Dr. Dre , Storch did craft a rousing beat, but did little to spice it up, a mistake that combined with the terribly chanted chorus (you guessed it: “X!”) to give this track almost no chart success. A very underrated rapper, Xzibit works well with the track, but again does little to make it all memorable. Sure, this song could be labeled “good,” but club-worthy it is not. Equating that statement, it’s apt to point out how all members put in a good effort (Storch’s salsa-esque piano spirals, Xzibit’s laid-back flow), back none of them flavored it enough to make it danceable.   Career Highlights   You Got Me - The Roots   feat. Erykah Badu   (#39)  Probably Storch’s top achievement, the Roots’ “You Got Me” from their 1999 release  Things Fall Apart  is a brilliant hip-hop ballad that combines a back-to-basics Erykah Badu crooning with heartfelt lyrics over a lush acoustic line that could have pushed even more free love at Woodstock. Simultaneously seductive and heart-wrenching, the track was so good that it won the Roots a  Grammy , an award as appropriate for the band as it was for Storch. Ultimately, this song was the breakthrough that the Roots had been waiting for, a summit that they hadn’t achieve previously and, unfortunately, haven’t achieved since.   Baby Boy - Beyoncé feat. Sean Paul   (#1)  Ah, the power that Beyoncé’s “Baby Boy” had. It was the one track Eastern enough to funk up the desert while Western enough to top the  Billboard  charts. It was the one track cool enough to blast windows-down while hot enough to make  Jay-Z  jealous (he infamously denied Sean Paul the right to perform it with Beyoncé at an awards show). It was the one track simple enough to guarantee Beyoncé as a household name while complex enough to be called a production peak for Scott Storch, who laid down the track without samples (unlike Beyoncé’s other chart-topping hit, “Crazy in Love”). A sick schooling session in Eastern-tinged RB, Storch finally mastered a sound that numerous producers had attempted before him. Techno bleeps and psychotic strings swirled with a killer bass line, all topped off by a steaming Beyoncé and a ruckus-causing (though hard to understand) Sean Paul. Easily the best-produced pop song of Storch’s career, “Baby Boy” is a feat that will be hard to top.   2004 Mentionable Tracks (Grammy Material)   Don’t Say Nuthin’ - The Roots  Previously described by myself as a “verbal driveby through Chinatown,” it seems that I have a love-hate relationship with “Don’t Say Nuthin’,” the lead single from the Roots’ 2004 summer release,  The Tipping Point.  Yes, the Roots are loved by much of the world, consistently fighting as that underground hip-hop squad who plays their own instruments and still rocks out. But, with this track, they don’t play their own instruments, most noticeably  ?uestlove , who’s usually pace-driving percussion is morphed into a clubbier drum machine. Similarly, gone is the funky wordplay of lyrical genius  Black Thought , present is some high-speed dissing and all-too-common self-praising. And while the beat naturally bobs heads, it cops  Lil’ Bow Wow’s  “Let’s Get Down” and is very short of “Baby Boy,” Storch’s bar-setting Eastern jam from 2003. The track, at times, can sound good, but its not the Roots’ best, and its not Storch’s best. “Don’t Say Nuthin’” sounds overproduced, a problem that the Roots have never had, and a problem that we hope they’ll never have from here on out.   Lean Back - Terror Squad   (currently #4)  The fastest rising single of summer 2004, Terror Squad’s “Lean Back” is meant for late-night drives through shady neighborhoods so that one can, well, dance (or, if you’re a friend of  Fat Joe’s , just lean back). Mixing cinderblock percussion with an equally funky and chilling string line, Scott Storch gave the Terror Squad a defining moment with this track. Surprisingly, Fat Joe and  Remy  hold their own, each one of them spitting unnerving lines over the already unnerving beat, making the entire episode a scary listen. With “Lean Back,” the Terror Squad may actually nab a  Grammy , which could be attributed either to Storch’s beat and the Squad’s rhymes or to no one wanting to fuck with Fat Joe. I’ll side with the former for now.
