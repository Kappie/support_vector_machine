I kinda did it off and on and really did nothing. And then I went up to the pool and swam for a little to just unwind. Then, I ... ummm ... yeah! I did nothing else lol. Wait! I went outside and played basketball. Oh and on my way home from the pool, I was about at my house, and i can see my dad letting my dog out. Well there are two old people going down the road in a hover round. Well it turns out that my dog thinks he can take there wierd hover round things she has never seen before. So she takes off down the road after them. Well she catches up and I'm really close to them and my dad yells at me to get her. But the old guy was so awesome. He was like "Aw, the dog finally thought he could take on something his own size, let him run after us, he is just having fun." Well my dog sees that I'm there so she stops. And I run and pick her up, and then take her back to my dad. It was pretty funny. Well I guess you would of had to of been there. Well I really have nothing else to say. I have to get up at 6:30 tomorrow. I'm not looking forward to that, but oh well, what can you do. Well I have nothing else to say. Have a good night! See some of you tomorrow bright and early!
