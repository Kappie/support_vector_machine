Damn Sexy Beast. I haven't really talked to him, to shy, but tomorrow i'm just gonna act like I've known him all my life and get the fuck over it. Mia and I looked at clothes with Nicole. I love Ralph Lauren, they have some really sexy shirts, for guys and girls. Mia and I are applying everywhere, so we won't be broke for much longer. I want to go clothes shopping next weekend with Bean  Mia, and want to invite Megan, Sarah and of course, 'Mark'. (Provided he likes shopping!) AP exam in a few weeks, dreading it, gonna flunk it, who the fuck cares!?
