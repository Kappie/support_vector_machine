It was a real bummer I had to go alone, and that kinda upset me. The first act bored me to teears, but the second act was very good. I got really disappointed at the end though: I didn't really get to talk much to Bri, and I didn't get to say a word to Katie or Katey. :(. Then, as if that wasn't bad I couldn't go to the afterparty because it was too far :(. Well, maybe they'll have another one tomorrow after the 2:00 show. (If so, call me guys!)  Hmm... what else happened? Oh! I finally got RCT2 to work. I feel bad for not paying for it, but eh ;\, whatcha gonna do?  School is in about 10 days, and I haven't started the Odyssey homework :(.  As the good book says...   .Music   New Found Glory - Failures Not Flattering  All American Rejects - The Last Song Story of the year - Swallow the knife
