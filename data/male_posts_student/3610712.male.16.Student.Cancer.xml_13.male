Then we watched Gladiator and then sat around. On Saturday, Sarah and I went to Eric's to play more musik with Master Luke. Sarah and I went to Cabrillo and walked around for awhile, then came back and watched the Pepsi 400 on TV. Jeff Gordon won again...score. Then yesterday I went to Huyck Stadium to watch the fireworks with Sarah and then went back to her house to watch a movie. Good times. Goodbye.
