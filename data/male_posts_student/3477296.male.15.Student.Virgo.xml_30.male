Sure, you may be casually strolling past NSB one day and notice all the construction work going on in the front and think “wow this school can afford to build a new carpark, turfed area and new tennis courts” but think about this, it took our school something like 5 years to get the permit and federal funding for that. Most of that funding came from our parents anyway leading me to think that maybe the school has just been saving all the building fund donations from parents for the past 20 years in the eventuality that despite all the governments promises, there is no way in hell that they are going to give our school money.  	In the newspapers are few months ago, we all read that NSG had a million dollars in their trust fund, which made us NSB’s realize how much better our education could possibly be if we were taught at NSG. This notion was stopped when we got to the third letter of NSG, which we understood to mean girls. Obviously this created a problem. Fortunately for us boys (and NSG’s who read this), the mind of an adolescent male supposedly thinks about sex every eight seconds, so eight seconds later we promptly forgot about that topic and found something else to think about for the next eight seconds before we got distracted again.  Recently a friend from NSG asked a group of us whether our school actually followed a curriculum. Do people think that our school’s poverty is really that bad? The answer to that would be yes (the curriculum question, not the poverty one), but one can never be too sure. This question was asked following a brief exchange of what we have learnt in school so far and a comparison of textbooks. I have noted that in the subject of Latin we have the same textbooks, but they are ahead of us in learning and their textbook pages a white and shiny while ours a stained, tattered and yellow. They have one textbook for all the math classes while we have like five different textbooks for each of the five math classes. “Can’t afford a 150 book set” is what I thought I heard. I put that in, in the vain hope that a highly recognized public school education official with connections to the government will read this and increase our school funding or drastically cut funding to the girl’s school.  In the same session I also learnt that the level of information the girl’s are learning is much higher than what we are learning. This matter was put to rest when a friend said “Their teachers get paid”, which is a fair enough comment when you think about it.  I’m pretty sure that’s why NSG always beats our school in HSC rankings (the fact that boys are lazy bludgers, who wouldn’t do work if our lives depended on it had absolutely nothing to do with the rankings). It makes sense, paid teachers are happy teachers and it’s quite obvious that our teachers aren’t happy. For instance, today one of the geography classes had a substitute teacher. As I was leaving the school for sport, I saw the real teacher drive into the school and park his car. This prompted me to wonder whether our school is really bad enough to cause the teachers to jig. Of course the teacher in question could have been in an important meeting outside of school, but for the sake of the argument I’m going to assume that he wasn’t. So in the hope that someone important will read this I offer this ultimatum. Give us money or give us some of NSG’s money. It’s quite obvious that they don’t need it, girls are supposed to be resilient and I’m sure they’ll find a way to get more somehow. Failure to do so could result in hostile action. I mean we’ve already turned the school into a terrorist training camp with “Storm the Castle” and pretty soon you’ll have a bunch of semi-intelligent terrorists running around. Now you wouldn’t want that would you?
