Recently, out of frustration at the various, overly sentimental scrawlings I made on the cover, I blacked out all the words save the "Positions" in "Compositions" [I was in the process of blacking the entire word] and my name. The composition book's contents disgust me no less, but masking it all would be too great an effort given the questionable reward of destroying pages of written material. Almost all of the aspects of this site stem from the fact that i have to put something there to begin with. Yesterday and today i've been at Sean's house; I hadn't been here for weeks. The fact that i had things to do which could only be done from my house complicated matters, but in all honesty i've been in something of an antisocial depression for a while. It's not only the situation surrounding my dad's job and the prospect of moving; something else, a general desire to escape everything, even those things which i can say [without certainty, of course] that i like, pervades. I feel that because i live in a world with multiple "bases of operation" my life is needlessly complicated. Why should i have to return home to attend to my ebay auctions? Why should home be there anyways? And even Swarthmore seems distant when juxtaposed against Philadelphia, a place i have begun to regard as more natural by the day. It's not just business, or even the social situation. Having divided location means that means for self improvement are equally divided. If i were to take guitar lessons it would have to be near my house, yet it's a place i long to escape. I can't go to lessons here in Swarthmore, and while i could take lessons in Philadelphia transportation would, as always, complicate matters. I just feel as though i am, in a sense, homeless. Earlier today i made a concerted effort to listen to the songs on my iPod i got from Sean a while back; they're mostly popular songs, and aren't the sort of music that i'd generally listen to. They are, however, the sorts of songs you'd expect to [or perhaps even have] hear on the radio. I had myself convinced that i was enjoying it, getting to hear "modern classics," getting more "in touch" with modern society; I realized then, finally, that much of my "confusion" is merely subconcious farce.
