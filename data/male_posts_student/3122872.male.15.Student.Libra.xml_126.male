I'm gonna punch you in the face until you bleed to death   And, yes, that was neither here nor there...        Hmm, I wonder if watching Kill Bill will have a detrimental effect on my cousin... she sort of sat through the first half hour with a sort of rapturous awe...        In a bad movieI shall find this to my disadvantage some day when I'm assailed by a murderous 6 year-old brandishing a large cleaver :/      But I doubt it somehow...            hopefully...            Meh...
