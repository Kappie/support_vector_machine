A family friend (Jill) introduced me to this fellow (Ryan) who works here.  Ryan looks very much like Jude Law, and is quite darkly funny.  I took a fancy to him rather quickly.  Sunday was boring.  Managed to embarass myself in front of Ryan for the first time.  Again on Monday.  Tuesday got more interesting.  I was wandering around, and heard people shouting at me.  So I found them.  Now this was an interesting evening.  There were 4 of us.  Chris, Marshall, Ryan and I.  Now the ages were interesting.  Ryan, 19, me, 16, Marshall, 39, Chris, 28.  The group spanned 4 decades.  I spent the evening with 3 very drunk gay men.  The conversations were amusing, and I found out a lot of interesting shit, that's irrelevant to anyone that reads this.  I also had one of those weird "mentoresque" moments with them.  It was like: this is my life in 5, 10, 20 years.  I wonder where I'll actually be then?  -Mike  "Everyone's a little bit racist, sometimes, doesn't mean we go around commiting hate crimes. Look around and you will find, no one's really colorblind, maybe it's a fact we all should face, everyone makes judgments based on race."
