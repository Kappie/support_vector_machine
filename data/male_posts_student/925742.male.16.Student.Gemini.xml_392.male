And doing so not only is SAFE, but has increased my Unreal Tournament 2003 framerates (highest detail, 1024x768 resolution) BY MORE THAN 50%.  Thats right, 50 mhz = 50+%.  From 25 - 40 average fps I get 40 to 65.  Un. Bel. Ievable.  And I don't think any melting will occur if I just Overclock when I play games.  I'm so happy I actually took the time to test this out!  I can play sooo much better now.  Dare I go to the max??  378/370???  Muahahhah, I rule.  In a geeky, nerdy, dork way.  TIME FOR SLEEP.  Oh, speaking of Unreal Tournament 2003:  "When you kill a man, you're a murderer. Kill many, and you're a conqueror. Kill them all... And you're a god!"   -From the lyrical genius of metal, Dave Mustaine.
