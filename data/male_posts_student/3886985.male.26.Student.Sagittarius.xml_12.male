I had to finish the intro. ;)  Anyway, I've been trying out a bunch of free blogging sites lately, in an attempt to find a good, quality (and free) blogging company. I'm a little broke right now, so I can't afford to pay for the monthly hosting fees.  Let's see how this goes, and I hope I'll see you back for more.
