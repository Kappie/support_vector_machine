Her blood and sweat became one as her fingers trembled on the trigger. Her eyes were as empty as her skin was pale. That was the end of her story.  One death is all we do not ask for. One life is all we do. Breathing is a habit that everyone breaks.   I watched a young man acknowledge fear for the first time. His actions were spontaneous and beyond reason.   Through emotion, scars appeared on his eyes. He did not fit. This dream is technical. Emotion does not exist.
