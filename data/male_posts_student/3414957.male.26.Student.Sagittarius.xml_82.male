In my mind I was a friend, however, in the other persons mind I wasn't much of anything. The best thing for me is to forget this whole thing, forget the past of this person, present, and the future of this person. I don't wish harm or anything bad; its just that why bother?   Good bye      It is like 90 degrees in my room. I am almost done with my english homework and I've finished my stupid math. I have to draw my art project today. I think I am going to wait until everyone leaves the house later on to start on it. I think I am going to draw my hot water heater in my garage with some tools on it. It has a good shape and nice easy lines so I should finsh that quickly....I hope.
