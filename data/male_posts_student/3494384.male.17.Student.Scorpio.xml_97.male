Talk and discuss lotsa things before we get into details of studying. Airport. We'll be studying at airport. Lishen isn't going for dont know what reason.  Meet up with them, walk around and take a look at my working place last time.  Saw a new Indian lady doing Mary's job. Where the hell is Mary? She quitted? Saw some Joyce doing clearance. She deserve it. Fancy her always requesting to do cashier. Saw the always coquettish Alice. Shaking her butt all over Lavazza. Wei jie too, he's doing what I'm doing a few months ago. Subway. Saw my Subway manager also. That arrogant slut. Argh...  Someone saw me. The overall manager in charge. He saw me. That fatso.  Didnt see the backstabber Glenn anyway. Hope he's dead.  Anyway, study for 4 hours on a single chapter on IISO. What the hell!!! Didnt brought my A Maths Testbook so i cant study it. What the hell!!!  Gonna stay up and not sleeping tonight to continue my revision. Term tests are like major exams now. Argh!!! I dont wanna fail any of my subjects.  Where the hell is my Tag Board? Argh!!!  Why didnt Donkey reply my sms. Miss Donkey alot alot. Donkey smsed me to study hard this afternoon. I got to listen. That's my motivation. :D  Donkey, I love you!!! :D
