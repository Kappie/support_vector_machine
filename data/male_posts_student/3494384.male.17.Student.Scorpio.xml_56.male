Went to school today for 12 lesson de lecture then all the way to 4 de other classes. Didnt really enjoy myself today (Who will enjoy lesson that you DONT understand?) but at least some interesting happening lorhz... My group of friends hate a lecturerer so much cuz he teach us shit and nothing but shit. That bald head fucker. He stinks. Keep repeating himself when we told him we dont understand and ended up we more blur... Ass face... What's more he is teaching us our most important de subject de lehz!!! Jave MOBILE Programming. MOBILE lehz! The blood of my course. What the hell! Anyway, Jiahao's comments on him really is funny. Hahaz.   After class, went to dinner with Xinhui, Darius (Not the NS one :P) and Collin. What the hell. ELLIN was there. Darius DARE bring that skank together. That ass. How dare! didnt he know me and that skank got something before? That slut. Rebonded her hair and ended up looking like a prostitude or rather a whore. Went to design school and bought western food. Nice nice food. Chat with Xinhui about her plans for the future. 3 years later and she's going to the States to study... Hiaz... F Bu 5 gonna miss you... i didnt really take note of that skank during the whole time cuz I just ignore her. Wanxin sms me asking us to meet her for dinner after that so me and Xinhui agree to go another round of food so off we went to meet Wanxin lorhz. Saw her best friend, quite pretty and humorous. Wanxin was totally a joke cuz we make a tease out of her butt! :P Kewl stuff!  After that, all of them got their own CCA so I went home. How dare I ask Vincent out and he reject again. Angry so later we ended the call unhappily. Went to Tampines Mall alone, bought Landy Wen's de album which I'm listening to now. She turn into so pretty lorhz. Later I'll post her picture up. :)  Meet Daniel when I called him since he was in the vincinity. Went for some food and later went home.   Oh ya! I forgotten that I seen my BEST pal during my primary school days in TP! I think he did not see me... Seen him twice in TP. Later seen him again in T Mall but he didnt see me (Or at least I hope it is this way cuz how can he ignore me! I wouldnt say hi first de cuz I am not the kind lorhz). Anyway, still the same ol Gareth. Later see if got time I shall go Friendster and see can search him mahz...   Darius arhz Darius, you take care in your camp larhz. So late still not yet have dinner yet.  Hiaz... Im so sianz. Project de proposal are due in about a weeks' time. Argh!
