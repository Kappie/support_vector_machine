Only some basic understanding of concepts and attention in class is required to do well. The same cannot be said, I think, of the mid-term exams, which will require more focused and in-depth study, particularly in Accounting.        Here's a snapshot of my record so far, which will also serve as a personal reference at this point to me:         Communications - An essay on 'Who am I?' fetched a B+ (highest awarded was A), a quiz fetched 8/10. Another quiz is due on Wednesday.        Accounting - first quiz fetched full marks (10) and today's quiz will also fetch the same, since there was only one embarrassingly simple question to solve        Org. Behaviour - first quiz - 16/20, second quiz - 18/20 (these quizzes had 20 true/false questions to be done in 5 minutes, with +1 for a correct answer and -1 for an incorrect answer. In the first quiz, I attempted 18 with 1 incorrect answer. In the second, I attempted 18, all of which were correct)        IT for Mgmt. - expect 9-9.5 on 10 in one quiz here. Another is due on Thursday or Friday        Quantitative Analysis - 7/10 in the first quiz, 9/10 in the second one.
