Portugal responded by attacking ferociously but without creating the real heat. But just 7 minutes before, Helder Postiga headed the equalizer. England gained a little strength in the continuing minutes and actually scored a second goal, but the referee (mistakenly in my view) called it off.  Portugal's substitute Rui Costa scored Portugals second goal 20 minutes into overtime but England got their second five minutes later when Frank Lampard leveled. In the penalty shot out, David Beckham missed his second penalty in the tournament. Luckily, the Portuguese missed on later as well. In the seventh round, the Portuguese keeper Ricardo saved Darius Vassell poor penalty and then scored the winner against David James himself. Portugal through to the semi finals.  My Man of the Match: Ashley Cole.  France - Greece 0 - 1   On beforehand, it looked like it would be a easy game for France. But France didn't measure up while the Greeks played convincingly. After an even first half, France started the second half better but that only lasted 10 minutes. 20 minutes into second half, Greek captain Zagorakis flew down the right flank and delivered the ball to Charisteas who could head the ball into the net. France tried to put some pressure on the Greeks defense but they stood up strong and the only real opportunity were handed to Henry who headed the ball wide. Greece goes through.  My Man of the Match: Angelos Charisteas.
