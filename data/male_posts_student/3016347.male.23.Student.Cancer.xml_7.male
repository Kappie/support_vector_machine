Bottomline : If you found someone who truly appreciates you, she deserves more of your love.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  maybe i look better if i smile more. hehe...seriously.......maybe i shouldnt be looking so cool to anyone which i am not familiar with. hah.....havent heard anything from my sis about her colleague. but one thing for sure is tat she sometimes did ask about me and tat day she even ask my sis to intro me to her. no kd, ok? she saw me when i was waiting at dunkin with my grandma. anyway, i wont think so much as i know my family will not allow my sis to intro her to me. hehe.......nvm....  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*   Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  and next month, we are going to celebrate yvonne birthday, we have never celebrate for her so hope this yr we can do something for her. it will be a surprise party n i think we will get her a bouquet of roses (she never receives it before). hope she will remember this birthday though....sometimes i wonder why there is no guys who are after her, she is quite pretty, tall and most importantly she is a good girl. but too bad, she older than me...haha...but then i feel really confortable with her though cos we talk nearly everything except personal things. hope we will have a great time, it's nothing more better than seeing someone smile/happy for wat u have done for them. this are the things money cant buy for anything else, we can ask yvonne to use her card......haha.    p/s if there is any good looking, caring and good guy, pls contact me.......otyew@hotmail.com. rich or not, is not important, a good future/career is enough....haha...she will kill me if she knew about this. and btw, only over 30 ok?
