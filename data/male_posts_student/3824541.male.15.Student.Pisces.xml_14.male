I've decided to seek out a girlfriend. I have no idea how long it'll be until I find one, but I'm in the mood where I want to cuddle, and other stuff. *ahem*. I have this strange feeling I'm going to hook up with somebody at The Warped Tour which is in 1wk 18hrs 13mins 38secs (As of this post). Katie called and said she couldn't go to it this morning.  Sad :(.  Then I spoke to Raju who said he thinks he'll be able to coax his parents into taking us. Sounds good.    Bobby called me today :). For the first time in awhile Bobby called me unexpectedly just to talk. Which was cool. It's weird, I talk to the kid every night from 8 - 12, but I really liked how he just called to talk in the middle of the day.  Happy :).  I think hat's the reason he called so unexpectedly, just to show me we're still friends. Fine with me.  I hid this one well :)! I dunno what to say though :(.  I was up until 1:30 this morning thinking about 'stuff.' What I'd wear to The Warped Tour, when would be the best time to see Bobby again, and etc. I've decided to wear a button down shirt with board shorts, and I'm going to buy some uber-hold red gel to make short, but pointy spikes. I've also decided I'm going totry to fly Bobby up when I have school so he can 'shadow' me(My school offers this thing where you can bring someone who doesn't go to the school to follow you around all day).    My parents are out trading our Explorer. I think they're going to bring home and ugly Suzuki XL-7. :(. Ugly. Look it up online. What's strange is my family ismade of three people and the XL-7 is like a van. Wtf? Crazy peoples.  I actually had a lot to say for a day where I've felt under the weather all day.
