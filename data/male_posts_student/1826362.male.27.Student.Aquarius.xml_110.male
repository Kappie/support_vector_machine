But it seems a little cheap and gimicky to me sometimes.  Like rearanging pieces of newspaper articles and putting them together and making it into a poem.  They also seem, at least so far, to all be overtly political, which is fine, just not my cup of tea.   I'm happy as a clam in my 20th Century African American fiction class because we are jeading nothing but philosophy for the first three weeks.   And my class in Modern Drama is quite interesting, the prof is funny, i'm reading lots of plays that I should really already be familiar with, but I'm not.
