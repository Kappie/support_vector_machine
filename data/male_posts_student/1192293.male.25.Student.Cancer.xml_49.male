He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the Nation as a whole. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about him than about any one else. – Teddy Roosevelt in the Kansas City Star, May 7, 1918 Here's a couple more. I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.  – James Madison, June 16, 1788 Liberty has never come from the government. Liberty has always come from the subjects of government. The history of liberty is the history of resistance. The history of liberty is a history of the limitation of governmental power, not the increase of it. – Woodrow Wilson Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first. – Ronald Reagan, March 2, 1977 (Obviously speaking about himself) The best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation. – James E. Carter There is nothing wrong in America that can't be fixed with what is right in America. – William Clinton The more I study it [the Constitution], the more I have come to admire it, realizing that no other document devised by the hand of man ever brought so much progress and happiness to humanity. – Calvin Coolidge, 1929 We Americans have no commission from God to police the world. – Benjamin Harrison The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion. – George Washington, Treaty of Tripoli, 1796 Christianity neither is, nor ever was a part of the common law. – Thomas Jefferson, February 10, 1814 War should never be entered upon until every agency of peace has failed. – William McKinley, March 4, 1897 Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear. – Harry S. Truman Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, in a final sense, [is] a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. – Dwight Eisenhower, April 16, 1953 Evil acts of the past are never rectified by evil acts of the present. – Lyndon B. Johnson, July 21, 1964  And, Dubya, I'll let you get the last word. If this were a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier – so long as I'm the dictator. – George W. Bush, Dec. 19, 2000   urlLink Attribution
