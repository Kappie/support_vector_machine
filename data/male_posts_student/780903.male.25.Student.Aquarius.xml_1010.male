I don't know if it was too fast to be understood, or just not very compelling on stage, but this seemed to be the moment of the show when everyone suddenly had to go the bathroom...   "Learning Legalese," to the tune of The Vapors' "Turning Japanese"   My eyes are bleeding, from all this reading I wish the casebooks were not twelve inches thick All this dissenting, is unrelenting I need a study guide -- and I need it quick! It's got me throwing up and laying down and staying in; I'm failing out.  I'm learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really hope so  (learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really hope so) Meeting of the minds, retainer, eminent domain, right of assumpsit  Lawyer-client priv’lege, discharge, automatic stay, habeas corpus Affidavit, deposition, amicus curiae, jurisidiction!   I'm a beginner, books should be thinner I kicked the tax code and I fractured my toe Although I'm gifted, this can't be lifted I need an outline for this outline -- I know! Must get these books to class, I need my Mom, to help me haul them all around (big fat woman walks on stage -- which never happened in the show... maybe this alone is why the song failed to inspire!?!?!)  I'm learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really hope so  (learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really hope so) Arbitration, breach of contract, fraudulent conveyance, prima facie Prosecution, statutory, stay of execution, sui juris  12-b-6 dismissal, joint and several, three-pronged test, fee simple transfer   No words with less than fourteen letters No teachers speak a language I understand No one told me Latin would be necessary No one told me law school would be quite this scary ...  No one... That’s why  I'm learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really think so, think so, think so  (learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really think so)  Learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really think so  (learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really think so)
