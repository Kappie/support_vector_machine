Smith concert with some friends........it was me, melinda, my big bro, shelly, alicia, craig, janna, and jakob.  The concert was awesome but if it was up to me they should have just kicked micheal w. smith out and let david crowder play more.  Today it was hard waking up in time for sunday school, seeing how i went to bed at 3, but i made it on time.  After church we finished the bible study on the book "Its Not About Me".....great book, better bible study, best teacher.  Sad that its over, i learned so much.  Then tonight i went back to church and there were a lot of people there, but not so many youth, so the usual, but that may change soon......after band camp that is.........well thats it for now. Have a great one!
