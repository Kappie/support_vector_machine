We stepped in and stopped at the 6th floor of The John Adams. We arrived first at Jill my coustins apartment in which she shes with one of my aunts, and my sister. It was really crazy when we walked in, noticing that the entire apartment was totally overcrowded with things. It made me ponder on where my sister slept. Considering Jill has a young one, i dont blame the apartment for being such a wreck.  After stopping by at Jills for the slight moment, we went 3 paces across to our apartment. Once i stepped in, i was apalled actually. The floors were white marble and beautiful. When you walk in, it had a very modern techy look. Everything white. The ceiling fan in the dining area was metallic and controlled by an electronic panel on the wall. The kitchen was very very small but it doesnt matter. Once going in and looking about, i noticed that once you go towards the part where the rooms are, the niceness fades. Everything else was basically un-new. There were however the 7 closets. I first stepped into the room which had the terrace. It was not as i thought. The room is probably the size of the one i currently have. Its got its own bathroom and the room has hard wood flooring. The bathroom was a horror actually. But there IS a super, therefore things like this can get easily fixed at any time.  I then stepped into the room that i was going to take. I was as well apalled at this in a bad way. The carpet was utterly disgusting in a burgundy red color. The walls were white with various stains and marks. The ceiling was unevenly layered along with glow-in-the-dark bevelled stickers in the shapes of various sized stars. I have two closets and one of them has a mirror on it which i love. But the only problem with the closets were that the insides were old, and the outsides have horrible paint jobs with dried paint on the mirror.  At the moment its 4:42 AM and i need to go sleep. The allergy syrup is starting to kick in, and we still have to clean up and move the rest of the shit in the morning. The movers will be coming on Wednesday. The cable will not be here for about a week or less and im hoping less. I will possibly be modemless.... So i really need a cell phone badly at the moment.  Im going to go sleep now. Hope everything goes well. I dont care, it most likely will. Basically i have Heather and Jill to take me out anytime i want =)=).
