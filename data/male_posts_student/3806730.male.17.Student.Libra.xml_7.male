I thought it was "normal", and that I'd eventually get rid of it all, whatever it was I ate. But yesterday it just got worse..I was reeling from the pain, and it hurt real bad, especially on afternoons, though I have no idea why. And then at 4pm yesterday, I had a fever, 38.5 C.  And so I had no choice but to go to the doctor and have myself checked.  Fortunately I had my roommate with me.  The doctor said I had infectious diarrhea and showed signs of dehydration already.  He would have been pleased if I had myself admitted in the hospital, but I told him that "kaya ko pa naman".  Then my roommate and I went ahead and bought the medication I needed.  I still had the fever until this morning.  I was having those terrible stomach aches at noon again so I slept for two hours.  At 4pm, I was feeling much better.  Hopefully this'll all be gone tomorrow.  I don't have class on Fridays, but it's really unfortunate that I missed 5 classes and 1 quiz today.  Still, GRACE overflowed for me, and instead of 3 quizzes, only 1 quiz was given today so I practically missed just one. haaaay.. thank you Lord!  My temperature's back to normal, and I'm feeling okay.  Tomorrow.. things will be even better.
