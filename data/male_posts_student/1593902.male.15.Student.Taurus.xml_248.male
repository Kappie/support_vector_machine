I still remember, that I was listening to sports radio 560 WQAM, listening o someone bitch about the dolphins, and the host "Orlando Alsagueri"(mispelled) or the Big O, jsut goes, Folks, there's news that a plane has hit the WTC, We'll let you know if anything else happens, and went back to regular programming. Bell rings, 8:50, i take myself up there, and i tell the Home room teacher, she sees it, and just changes the channel to the next one for our usual "morning anouncements".  Next period, I walk in and their showing the 2nd plane slam into the damn trade center at that moment it hits me.   Ya know what pisses me off? The coonts in my class jsut laughed, some stared hardyl believeing, and the other ones started kidding playing around, acting like imbeciles. I jsut stared and tlaked with my friend about it. What is it? It's the most important thing in NYC financially besides Wall street, etc. etc.   Then we're there and we see the damn things fall, and some kids were LAUGHING. Cuban kids, who thought it was funny,s ome sort of big jokes, i got damn angry as my cousin once worked at the WTC, punched him and go, there could be 50,000 people in those towers. In Each tower. And my family member could be one you prick. Only time in my life where the teacher stared point blank at me saw me hit someone and not do anything.   Then we got word the Pentagon was hit. At that point the teacher starts sobbing insanely, and THAT's when it hits the class. That's when Everyone really woke up, and then we hear about car bombs in LA, just panic and chaos. Then our electricity (which was being tested that day fittingly) went out briefly, for 2 minutes. We were shocked, we went to our next class, the idiot sub wouldn't let us touch the TV, until finally someone convinced him. Lunch was amaizng, all teh guuards and personnel were eating with their students, half the cafeteria was empty and we all jsut sat there staring.  By last class we saw the rest of it and we were basically numb. Quiet, no one saying anythign (this was the gifted class). the Teacher jsut tried to explain to us what it might be, why things like that.   There were like 5 students left.   Why would ya take ya kid outa the class?   scholls prolly the safest place in america at that point.   Anyways,I get home and watch it for the rest of the day. Next day at school we recieved a message formt eh superintendant and what not, but it was somber. It felt like we'd been shot. Mind you, people here know i'm not the patriotic flag waving idiot, and in some ways, america deserved A PORTION of what it got, but not those 3-4k people that died. Innocent civilians, living their lives like normal. No need for that. Scary part was my cousin had to go to work that day at noon. We in miami were afraid that the might bomb Homestead Air Base in the north, or the airport (which is less than a mile form me house).   The scariest part about everything was that Miami has a branch of the WTC. It's exactly 2 miles from my house, as part of the Radisson complex. And i was on me own till about 7. Amazing stuff.
