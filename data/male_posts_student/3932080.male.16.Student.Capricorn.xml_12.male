We have coasted through half a year with some extremely hot tracks, and its time to check on the innovators who keep us grooving by counting down the top 10 producers up to this point. Check in daily for the latest installment.    Producer #6: R. Kelly    000    Write Up  Probably the most sensually recognizable artist of this pop era, R. Kelly has become a household name for both the good (sex-charged R hits) and the bad (sex-fueled scandals), both of which have surprisingly aided his career. He seems to be a two-trick pony, but those two tricks have yet to fail; whether pushing shockingly hot club smashes (most recently the brilliant “Ignition”) or soul-food inspirationals (most famously “I Believe I Can Fly”), Kelly’s crowd follows right behind him, a popular tactic that’s lead him to don a self moniker, the “Pied Piper” of R A scandalous and guiltily pleasurable solo career in the early nineties helped Kelly become one of the hottest producers for younger artists, most notably the late  Aaliyah  (for whom he produced the debut album  Ain’t Nothing But a Number ). Most often falling back on Eastern-tinged beats heavy on flutes, acoustics, and suaveness (after all, he is the Pied Piper), Kelly’s productions are hard to miss, especially because he usually employs himself for the seductive choruses. Despite those aforementioned sex scandals, most of which have now been thrown out due to an unwarranted seizing of some illegal materials, Kelly has remained a universally popular hitmaker who seems unable to fail, regardless of who he’s working with. Cleverly constructing his singles as to front that he spends equal time in the club and the church (though full album listens tend to secure the former), Kelly has won  Grammy  awards and numerous other awards for his work as a vocalist and a producer. To nab this year’s  Producer(s)   Grammy , his solo release would have to be critically acclaimed ( Happy People/U Saved Me , slated for fall release), and he would need to put out some hot tracks with other artists. Still, the fact that Kelly is a contender for the award every year is commendable, even if there’s great reason not to commend.   History and Mentionable Tracks (followed by  Billboard charting )  R. Kelly has an extremely successful solo track record that combines with a knack for pushing new RB groups into fame. He’s one of the hardest working men in the biz (continually updating the charts with his own hits) and one of the most generous producers (giving some of his hottest beats to lesser artists).  1992:   Honey Love - R.

Trying to repeat the #1 success of “You Are Not Alone” from 1995, Jackson called in R. Kelly, a man who would never turn down the chance to work with a legend (Kelly also did sporadic work with the  Isley Brothers ). Kelly only needed a track that would sell as well as his sex tape, but instead he produced a mid-tempo ballad that fell terribly short of his better work (“I Wish,” “I Believe I Can Fly”). The weak charting of “One More Chance” pushes one of two messages: Either R. Kelly mega-gospels are outdated (very hard to believe) or the last thing Michael Jackson needs to revive his career is second-rate sop begging for “one more chance at love.”   The Best of Both Worlds  (album)- Jay-Z and R. Kelly   (#2)  Firstly, when the world’s hottest club producer and the world’s hottest pop MC launch an album that can’t even debut at #1, you know something’s wrong. The problem was that after the instant success of the Kelly-Carter collaboration “Fiesta,” which peaked at #6 on the  Billboard Hot 100 , the duo thought that they were invincible, so they rush-released a shared album that was lucky to find mediocrity.  The Best of Both Worlds  is a reasonable title (after all, they are the first bites on their respective genre platters), but the album showcases more the rest of both worlds, “the rest” being lesser selections from either artist. Hell, they shared in common the fact that they named themselves (Jay’s  Hova  and Kelly’s  Pied Piper ), but neither lived up to any name on this disc.   Career Highlights   Ignition - R. Kelly   (#2)  My generation has never heard a better summer jam than 2003’s “Ignition,” which spat in the world’s face while Kelly was under heavy speculation for his at-home igniting. The spit was so strong that Kelly bragged to “stick the key in your ignition” and still had millions dancing along, those millions probably able to decipher the metaphorical automobile. With a feel-good blend of jovial piano chords, cheery strings, and those watery synth slips from  TLC’s  “Waterfalls,” Kelly crafted his best single ever, with sing-along lyrics that every 9 year-old girl could make her parents extremely uncomfortable with (after all, who doesn’t want to “take it to the room and freak somebody”).   Bump, Bump, Bump - B2K feat. P. Diddy   (#1)  A landmark single for Kelly, this was his first club production to land the #1 spot on the  Billboard Hot 100 . Taking a simple (but trademark) acoustic beat, Kelly modeled the young group’s vocals around that very beat, perfectly contrasting a maturely sexual guitar with some immaturely horny brat packers. The chorus was a vocal blitz, stopping every few lines for the communal chant (“Bump, bump, bump!”) that sent the track to the top. It’s a wonder why B2K (of all people) got to introduce Kelly’s acoustic serenade style to the world, but it was one hell of an introduction, which you can thank for  Cassidy’s  “Hotel,”  Nick Cannon’s  “Gigolo,” and  Marques Houston’s  “Clubbin’.”   2004 Mentionable Tracks (Grammy Material)   Baby I Love U! - Jennifer Lopez feat. R. Kelly   (#74)  A track deserving a much higher charting, “Baby I Love U!” has verses that update  Geggy Tah’s  “Whoever You Are” in a reggae/urban realm  (“All I wanna do is to thank you/Even though I don’t know who you are/You let me change lanes/While I was driving in my car”  becomes  “It's like downtown New York/In the middle of traffic jam/All I really want you to know/Is who I am” ). The track sounds like an attempt to rewrite “Ignition” with an ’04 Bonny and Clyde. How a catchy track from the hottest duo to hit this year’s charts flopped is hard to explain, but it’s nothing to be ashamed of as a producer.   So Sexy - Twista feat. R.Kelly   (currently #30)  Laying down a snakelike beat to match Twista’s rapid-fire delivery, R. Kelly drops another potential summer hit with “So Sexy.” As with “Overnight Celebrity,” much of what Twista says means nothing (seeing as censorship has made much of his banter indecipherable), so that puts a lot of pressure on the chorus, which is a brilliant call-and-response between some beautiful ladies and, well, R. Kelly. The determining factor with this single, though, is the surprising aftertaste. Like watching  Ron Jeremy  at work, there’s a lukewarm pondering left at the end of “So Sexy,” leaving the listener to stumble over a respectable question: Wait, hot chicks think Twista’s sexy? Moments later, extreme self-confidence ensues.   Happy People/U Saved Me - R. Kelly   (Happy People: #19)  Unfortunately, to headline his 2004 fall double-disc release, R. Kelly chose two tracks that will not fare well with the pop charts. The first single, “Happy People,” is a two-step sequel to “Step in the Name of Love,” which had a strong #9 charting. Sounding like the chicken-picnic soulmate to  Usher’s  “Yeah!,” the track loops sampled “yeahs” in its chorus around a beat-shifting Kelly. Actually a better written track than “Step…,” “Happy People” unfortunately will not achieve the same chart success because it is pure country club, ditching all urban paraphernalia for a good rollick and a round of golf. Similarly, “U Saved Me” is a poor-charting single because it is nowhere near past Kelly jams (though a little better than  Michael Jackson’s  “One More Chance”). In the verses, Kelly narrates heart-wrenching tales of despair and ghetto-hopelessness only to culminate in a Lord-praising chorus, which takes a rise/fall pattern and milks it into a full-gospel sing-along. Ultimately, Kelly has made two trips to promote his new CD, one to the  Five Seasons  and one to the church. Problematically, no one is following.
