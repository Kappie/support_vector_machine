(i.e. little things, anything from that album) I used to like Simple plan too. Not. Okay maybe I took that one too far. So how about that US Olympic basketball team, they suck. Iraq soccer looks better. Hell we can't even beat Italy. (Being Italian I don't mind) For as much as I usually dislike Arabs, I must say that the Olympics may be just what they need to unite their nation and if it makes them any more respectable I'll stand behind it. Well looks like we (USA) have a shitty team. I'm listening to  The Tavis Smiley  show and their sports commentator is talking about how the American teams are cussing out anyone who beats us. "Its bad that we can't even accept defeat anymore, that we cuss out the better team. It's because we're so used to beating ourselves!" Isn't that true. We won't give "props" to Italy because we're so selfish and worry so much about being the most powerful in the land. I'll admit I'm the haughty American. I think my country could kick and others ass. Why? Because we're America and I'm a piece of this pie. Now lets assume I live in Italy for a minute. What do I think of the Americans? I think their punk ass bitches who can't live without starbucks, MTV, and some shitty teen idol to tell them what to think. Oh wait I all ready think that. For being the most powerful nation we aren't shit. When most of our people won't get off their asses to try to be anything more then middle class we have a problem. When we won't take responsibility for our own actions that's sad. When we're so obsessed with ourselves that we "deserve things" , "You deserve a quality car with an affordable loan no matter what your credit report says". No, actually you don't you have to works your ass off for a nice car and house and even then nothing's guaranteed. If you saw  Office Space   remember when Their talking about if you had a million dollars what would you do? Well they were right it is a bullshit question. I beieve that if someone doesn't fail were all screwed because no one would own a grocery store when they could do somthing better. Same with farming. Lets face it everyone who ever won an arguement was told they'd be a good lawyer, why don't we tell anyone who took out trash they'd be a good garbageman? Oh wait garbage "person" I don't feel like wasting my time on some dumb broad whose hurt because shes not getting her "props" if I say man. Either that or somthing along the lines of me being sexist. So anyway back to other shit. I think after this I'll post a list of people, their position on a subject and why it sucks.
