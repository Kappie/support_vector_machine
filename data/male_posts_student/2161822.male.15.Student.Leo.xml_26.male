We had the Walk For The Vikings today where you raise money to walk around our school. Hmm somethings wrong with this picture. We lose either way. We're paying money and we're wasting time and energy by walking around aimlessly for the lone reward of satisfaction. Ah, Hafey events are the greatest. Either way you end up contributing more money to the poor, cheap, doomed hell we dare to call school. After we finished our walk, me and a couple friends went to Yong Hao for some food before bowling club. And what else do we find but an abandoned car. What could we do with an abandoned car? Of course several rocks were thrown at the windows and many times were unsuccessful at breaking a window. You swear someone was watching us when a rock finally went through the window as we all scrambled and sprinted nonchalantly to the bowl arena. Halfway during bowling, two of the kids on my team were sick to their stomachs from the mass amounts of chinese food they ate a few hours ago. I don't think they even ate that much it was just that chinese food is so filling and seems to go through your system like a pound of baked beans. Anyway, they were able to control themselves for a little. Soon I walk into the bathroom to hear the cheerful sound that everyone dreams of hearing: that of someone gagging on chinese food and throwing it up. Yes, I knew it was bound to happen sooner or later. I was just amazed at the fact that he told me he was trying to aim when he was puking. He must of had very bad aim since the puke was all over the floor surrounding the toilet. As you can tell, I had a very fun filled Monday.
