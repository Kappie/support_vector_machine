Funny when you stop and think Time goes fast and then you blink Nothing's ever like it was Girl we've got a special thing And all the happiness it brings Is more than enough I know it's hard to believe You're still the biggest part of me All I'm living for  I still think about you I still dream about you I still want you, and need you by my side I'm still mad about you All I ever wanted was you You're still the one You're still the one  It's hard to breathe when we're apart You're like sunshine in my heart I keep you here inside You've been everything to me You've been and always will be The apple of my eye.  And I know it's hard to believe You're still the biggest part of me All I'm living for I still think about you I still dream about you I still want you, and need you by my side I'm still mad about you All I ever wanted was you  You're still the one You're still the one If you love me, look into my eyes And say you do  I've been waitin all my life for someone Just like you Baby after all we've been through Girl I'm still in love with you And I want you to know I do I do  Still think about you Still dream about you Still want you, and need you by my side Still mad about you  All I ever wanted was you You're still the one You're still the one  -Still by Brian Mcknight  We can't love, without getting hurt, is that the good or bad part?    //Phantom of the Opera//
