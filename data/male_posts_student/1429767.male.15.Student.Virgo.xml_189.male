I have been extremely excited for the past few days I still can't believe it all happened. It's just so surreal but so great at the same time I can't wait until the next Simple Plan show, it's also going to rock! I still haven't washed my SP shirt and I probably wont for a long time, I have it hanging on a hanger in my basement so I will see it over and over. It still smells new so that's good, maybe even a little like Chuck did :D! That show was amazing, truly it was, I have never felt that before in my life to see them play in real life was a mind blowing experience and then to meet them, well that just almost pushed me over the edge, I want to cry because of it I wish that the feeling would last forever but unfourtunately, it wont! Anyway, last night I was talking to Stacey and Courtney while I was shopping around for some Role Model shirts and some shoes from Hot Topic, possibly shorts also... I figured I'll get 10 shirts from Role Model and then some shorts, shoes, and a studded pyramid belt from hot topic. Yeah this year I'm going all out punk, that's my style I don't care what my mom says that's what I'm wearing from now on... Punk! I love the look! Well, as for now I must leave... My brother could call anytime....
