I used to struggle with this and then I realize- that is what separates true believers from people that are living in the world still.  We could be going to church performing miracles in Gods name and not necessarily doing anything wrong in our fellow mans eyes and not be Christian.  A true Christian doesn't do things so he can fell better about himself he does it for the glory of God.  He doesn't walk around all tough because he does the "right things", he admits that he's not perfect and that's why he seeks gods help.  So many times many of these 'cosmetic Christians" have made me doubt my faith.  We need to seek God.  Not the right actions.  This is why I care- for the glory of God- Gloria a Dios.
