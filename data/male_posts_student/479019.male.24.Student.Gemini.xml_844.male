I could use some onion rings right about now?  It's dawning on me how much work I have to do...  I'm looking forward to summer back in Irvine.  The episode of  The OC  from last week was fucking brilliant, let's see if they keep it up. Speaking of, which.. I'm missing California food... fresh fish, Mexican, good Japanese, In N Out, Del Taco, Carl's Jr, etc.  ***
