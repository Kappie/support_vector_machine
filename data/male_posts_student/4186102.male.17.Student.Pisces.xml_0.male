KAYTI- i have to apoligize to you the most, i have lied to you and i never wanted to do that, your a great person and you should have better. thats why i'm telling you if you havent already, to get over me, i'm not worth it... you knew from the begining and i kept telling you different, i met you through Ben, and i dont regret it either, i just never wanted a relationship... i was just a horney teen male and i'm here to say sorry. i did talk to Jamie and i can understand if you never want to talk to me again, i do care about you and i hope we can be friends.  ALLEGRA- your kayti's friend and i never meant to drag you into anything, i'm sorry for using you for my own gain. this was wrong and i hope your not made. you were a friend when i needed you and i never returned the favor so this is me saying i'm sorry. your suck a cool person, you say that yu have problems but just look at me, i got a whole lot of little ones. so i hope that we can still be friends, i'll be here if you need any help.  JORDAN- your a great friend we kinda drifted away since you moved and i feel like an ass for not talking to you much, i want you to know that no matter what i'm here if you need to talk and dont worry if i'm away talk anyways, i wont get that mad, lol. i hope we can get together soon your a great friend and... i dont know what else to say, your the best. if i ever hurt you... sorry and if i ever do hurt you... sorry in advance. you will never lose me as a bestfriend.  DEAN- i know for a fact that i'm an ass to you, and i'm sorry. its just something i do its nothing personal. you've been my best friend for as long as i can remember so never change. your cool in your own sense, like i'm a loser in mine. i can tell you anything knowing you wont make fun of me, your great and i know i will never lose you as a friend.  JEREMY- your a great guy and you always know what to say to cheer me up. even though a times i feel like killing you, just becasue you get all the girls. but you know thats a good thing, i just hope you dont become like your dad. you know hes a nice guy, hes trying to set a good example for you... you should look up too him, not hate him. you say that hes an ass, an that may be true. he loves you and i know that you love him. just get along for your moms sake. and for kims, bens, and mine, we dont want you to leave for the rest of teh summer. peace man.  KIM- your may friend and i dont want to lose what we have, i know i can be an ass, and i'm sorry. i never ment to hurt you (if i did) plus you've helped me so much that i need to give something back... i dont know what yet, but i'll find something. nothing will change how i feel towards you, your a great friend... i cant give you any advice because 1. its not my place to say anything. and 2. you dont need it your perfect in every way. to us in the future, friends.  BEN- man for some reason i dont know what its is but your still my friend. i treat you like dirt sometimes, i treat everyone at pine lake like dirt, and i'm sorry. please forgive me, i know i have been an ass, and i know that i will fix things sooner or later. your a great person and you can do whatever you want. disregaurd my feelings toward anyone,if there your friend i'll deal with it, because your mine. and i know you would do the same for me. Anti-God! you got me into that, and i started to listen to Cradle Of Filth. and all those other bands because of you, thanks for everything.  ALYSSA- you've changed me for the better. i've started to read and write... i'm going to learn how to play an insterment.... i hope. you just gave me a great perspective on life. as i said out at the lake befor you left, i like you. i have for many years. i never realized it till i saw you after so many years... you make me want to be happy. if i've ever been rude to you i didnt mean it. and if i ever am rude to you i'm sorry. i just want to say a few more things to you, i hurt to find out you liked Jeremy, (dont get mad at him for telling me) [i kinda already knew{because you look at him the same way i look at you}] your perfect, and i dont want you to ever change. i feel like a whole new person when i'm around you. the reason i was acting weird out at pine lake, was becasue i liked you, and knowing that you liked Jeremy and not me kinda made me mad. but i know i will never be with you, your too good for me, and i'm not really your type, (from what i've seen). i just thought you should know. your an awsome friend.  NICOLE- i did like you in grade 10, but i never knew you liked me. thats why i never did anything about it. knowing that you still like me after 2 years is kinda weird but i can deal with it. i just feel really bad for Phil because he is my bestfriend. i also know what hes going though, haveing a girl he liked, like someone else. its hard an it hurts, but knowing Phil hes a strong individual. he will make it though. just give him some time and he'll come around.... i hope. but i would like to talk to you more, so you will always be my friend.  TYRA- your so great... and to let you know i do like you. your a friend and i'm happy for you and dustine. i cant write much right now so. sorry in advace to anything i do thats stupid and immature, which is everything.. lol. sorry and have a happy life. if things go your way or if they dont i'll be here. your a great friend.  All of you may not want to talk to me because i have prolly lied to you some time or another, but if you still want to be friends it would make me so happy, i want to help anyone in need. i'm always here for anyone that need to let things go. i would like to talk to you all more in person if you have any questions. you ask anything anytime and i will try so hard to answer them. your all my friends and i love you all to the depths of my heart, i hope all can be forgivin. i may sound like a faggot but thats the risk i'm willing to take. if anyone has any questions dont be afraid to ask, i'll try to give an answer.
