I think that is a feeling everyone feels at some point in there life, but I don't anyone will ever admit they they have got the feeling. I love the song One Thing by Finger 11 because it brings up a great point that a lot of point don't notice. In the song it goes if I gave it all away for one thing, Wouldn't that be something? And In my opinion if you gave it all away for just one thing, then that is a big thing, but I guess in some peoples minds its nothing at all. The argument over this issue is just like the argument over the glass of milk, is it half full or half empty? Personally If you came up to me tomorrow and asked me that question I would say half empty. I wish in my mind that the 1st thing to come to mind was half full because that is a great way to think about life, but it isn't. Do you ever see something and outta the blue just get angry over it or something? I do stuff like that when I'm watching the Weather and the weather guy says something stupid, I get angry and wanna give him a piece of my mind, but there is nothing I can do about it so what is the point of even getting angry? I think getting angry over little things has got worse through the generations, but I don't really know this for sure because well, I'm only 14, give me a break. I have seen old movies and it just looks like everything was so simple back in the day, but movies know days prove that what happens in movies doesn't really happen in real life. Once again I don't really know why I am typing this, It just feels right, it feels like I may get something good out of typing this, and if you can get something good out of doing next to nothing why not go ahead and do it? Have you ever been just setting in bed or something and just thought in your mind that you need to start praying more often, that happened to me last night, I really started to think about stuff when I got that feeling last night. It was sad though because I started to pray and while I was playing I feel asleep, I think the people that say the teenage years are the hardest times are right, being a teenager sucks! I have also been thinking lately about sex, and yes I'm still I virgin don't even go there. I mean when you become a teenager you start getting the urge to go out and have sex and all that, but I made a promise with a friend a year or so ago that we wouldn't have sex until we got married and that promise has meant a lot to me. Just recently I found out they my friend had sex with her boyfriend, and that just kinda hurt in my heart. I mean I felt that we would both really make it until we were married, but I guess I was wrong. If it makes you feel any better my friend said that she didn't like the sex and didn't ever want to have sex again. I think I am writing this so I can post it on my blog and let the whole world see that it isn't just them having these issue, it is everyone. It was really weird how I started to write this, I got off AOL, and as soon as I did I just got the urge to open Micro Word and start typing, I am getting getting sleepy know, but I still feel that I most type more for you to read. Me and my dad have been having little issues lately, I mean he will piss me off, I will piss him off, that kinda issue nothing really big. Most of what he has been doing that is pissing me off is the fact that he needs a hearing aid, and needs one know! Something else that he has been doing that is making my mad is using my lap top, this my lap top, he has his own computer, why in the world doesn't he use his own? I know I most really sound like a rich preppy kid, but to be honest I'm not really that preppy. I mean I wear preppy clothes and crap, but besides that, I'm not really preppy. For some reason I have a issue with talking, I just don't talk a lot, I blame a lot of this problem on my dad and I don't really know if it is fair to blame him, but I don't really know who else to blame. I started my life living in Crescent, Oklahoma living around all my family and stuff. I had true friends in Crescent and friends I will never forget, ever! After my 4th grade year we moved to Madill, Oklahoma because of my dads job. When we moved we didn't know anyone from Madill or anyone really around there. It took my awhile to get used to living away from my family and crap, because I mean home is where the heart is and my heart was (and always is) in Crescent, Oklahoma with my family and friends. Madill, Oklahoma is a unique town (Madill aka Little Mexico) that was basically built on people going to Lake Texoma. If the lake was just to vanish overnight or something, so would the town. It seems like it was when we got to Madill that I really started to be quite, I just had a hard time making new friends and stuff. I think in my mind it was one of those thing where you think, I already have friends, why would I need new ones, but I don't think at the time I relized that I wouldn't be going back to Crescent anytime soon to go to school. So basically while I was going to school in Madill it was hell, to put it bluntly. I did manage to make some good friends and I had a few girlfriends along the way too, but after we moved on I really only had 1 true friend from Madill. Something else that I started to notice while living in Madill was the fact that I started having more girl friends (just friends) then guy friends, and I don't know that just doesn't seem normal for a guy to have more girl friends then guy friends. I think a lot of my quitness started in Madill because I had no one to talk to. My dad was the Manager at the local Wal-Mart so he was barely ever home, my dad and mom split up when I was like 1 or so, so there was no mom to talk to, and as I stated above I had a hard time finding friends in Madill. Anyways, after going to 5th and 6th grades in Madill my dad and I moved again to the wonderful Blackwell, Oklahoma. During my 7th grade year at Blackwell I once again had a hard time finding friends due to what I would think is the quietness and so I hung out with some interesting 8th graders at the time. Hey, I had older friends, whats to hate about it? But when my 7th grade year came to a end of course my 8th grade friends moved up to be freshmen leaving me all along with a big bunch of people my age, scary! So basically I started my 8th grade year off just like I moved to town, I had to get new friends! After a long search I eventually found a nice group of people to hang out with, but I just wasn't to happy with them all the time. I did notice that I would get to where I would open up and talk to them unlike I would to just any group of people, it sounds like I have a trust issue doesn't it, go ahead say it, you think I have a trust issue! Well, I even myself sometimes think that I have to have a high level of trust in people before I will talk to them, but that isn't true, or at least I don't think. I mean I think back and don't see any reason why I would have a trust issue in the first place, any ideas? I forgot to mention that while in Madill my dad found a girlfriend and she moved with us to Blackwell, sorry I left that detail out. My 8th grade year was actually starting to get better, when my dad announced that he was going to start applying for stores again so he could run a Super Center. When I first heard him say he was going to start applying again I wasn't to shocked because that is kinda what he always wanted to do, run a Wal-Mart Super Center and after so long of working for wally world he could know do it, and that is what he wanted to do. I really wanted to support my dad in applying to stores, because I knew that was what he wanted to do and that would make him happy, but to be honest I was just in plain denial that we were almost for sure eventually going to have to move again, and this was all coming when I was actually kinda starting to fell at home somewhere! Eventually in December of my 8th grade year or atleast around there my dad got a store in El Dorado, Kansas. It took my awhile to tell people I was moving, because well, I could hardly believe it. I knew when we got to Blackwell that we probably wouldn't spend our whole lives there, but after being there for a year or so that fact just kind of faded away, it is hard to explain. I even once had a dream that I was graduating HS in Blackwell, but I knew that it probably just wasn't gonna happen! The word finally got around school that I was leaving and I don't really think many people really gave a shit, but that's there problem not mine, even though it did affect me. I felt kind of good on my last day of school though, I kinda felt like some people cared. I remember in my Science class we had a going away party and stuff, that kinda made me feel good, but I really think someone just suggested it to get out of doing work, and with all that over on January 29th, 2004 I left B.M.S and tried to forget all the memories I had from the place! I really wish we could have stayed in Blackwell, I really do, I loved the town, most of the people and everything. The only thing I didn't like was the road construction and druggy neighbor we had across the street. I think it was around the 6th or 7th of Febuary when I started going to school at El Dorado Middle School (EMS), and lets just say it was a rough start. I kinda started out at EMS just like I started out at Madill, I have friends already why do I need new ones? And so I guess I just went into quite mode and didn't really do much talking while in school. I did talk to my friends from Blackwell after school though, I mean they are my friends of course I talked to them. I did make some friends while going to EMS, but I mean non one I would jump infront of a car for or anything like that, just friends that I can talk to during school and stuff like that. I just don't really know about El Dorado. My dad likes it here, likes his job and stuff like that. Oh Yeah, once again I forgot the story on my dads girlfriend. She moved with us once from Madill to Blackwell then she moved with us again from Blackwell to El Dorado, after being here for about a month or so she started cheating on my dad with a friend of hers. I don't really like to talk about her, because when I do it just kinda pisses me off, but I think she has also caused some of the mental problems in my life, and by mental problems in my life I mean like the fact that I am Ultra Quite and stuff like that. We got out of school sometimes in May, I didn't really do anything all summer, and here we are, all caught up to the present? What really is the present, I mean the present isn't the past of the future, but when I type 'right now is the present', when I typed 'right' is now in the past, so how can there ever really be a present? There are many great mysteries on earth and I don't have plans on talking about them all here, but I have and have plans to talk about a few. Something else that I think is wrong with my life is my family. I have 2 grandmas that I just don't know what I'm going to do with just yet! I have one Grandma (Norma) who ever time I see her or call her she always grips about how I need to call more often, and everytime she gripes about it I just want to ask her right back 'why don't you try calling me for once?, but I never do ask that, because that would be rude to ask. So, basically I'm not calling that grandma anymore, and It really doesn't hurt inside or anything because I knew that I guess this is probably a nicer way of saying 'why don't you call me?. I have another grandma that just recently got remarried to a trucker and she has changed so much since she got remarried. She used to be like always there when you needed her and stuff and now she is hardly ever there. Like I went to Crescent a few weeks ago to visit my family and my Grandma Pat (she lives in Watonga, Oklahoma) seen me towards the beginning of my stay and while she was there she said she would see me again on Friday when we were all going to meet in Kingfisher to go do something. Well, I think it was on Thursday her new husband came home early from delievering something and when he is home she waits on him hand and foot, and that is just plain stupid! So I guess pointless to say she was to busy to meet us on Friday and that just kinda pissed me off because I am her grandkid and she hardly ever gets to see me, but she would rather wait hand and foot on her husband then see me. I know what we was going to do in Kingfisher know, we where going to meet at Wal-Mart to look at backpacks because she was getting all her grandkids a backpack so my cousins and I where going to meet her there and pick one out, but like I said she was too busy for us! After I got back home I got a check in the mail from her for $20 to get a backpack and I still haven't spent the money, and I really don't know If I'm going to. It just pisses me off how her priorities go in her brain, I just don't get it! I am seriously just considering tearing up the check and putting it in the trash or cashing the check and donating it to a Back-To-School supply fund for kids that can't afford there back to school supplies, wow, that sounds like a good idea, I think that is what I'm going to do! My mom (actual mom, the one my dad divorced) emailed me awhile ago asking me when I was coming down this summer and what it comes down to is 2 she needs to plan this stuff earlier! I can't wait until August 1st to find out she wants me to come down during the summer. I mean at the end of July on I am busy doing stuff to get ready back for school almost any chance I get out of the house! I still feel like I need to type more, tell more, get more off my shoulders, but I am just drawing a blank when it comes to what I need to type about next! With all that said I think I'm going to close this letter with a though about the whole letter, a tear about the sad parts, a smile about all the funny parts, and maybe a new outlook on life, just maybe!  -Aaron
