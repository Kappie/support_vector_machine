Hey guys on Sunday July 18th my church is having a car wash to raise money! If you wanna continue being friends with me you should come. JK!! But if you need a car wash you guys can stop by. Oh, and i dont think i like mullet anymore. But, once i see him i prolly will. I hate this so much, seriously. That is what my dreams are about. I gotta go though. Much love, Rach
