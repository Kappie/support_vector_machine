Sed., Summer, Lady Neptune and I are all going to blog it. Hope you'll enjoy the fresh look, coming up next week (hopefully). Anyway back to bussiness. Today NYC experienced the worst weather, we had ten-mintute thunderstorms.  TEN MINTUES , what good is that? It's like fucking mintute men who can barely last, curse you minute men...Brings back memories of old...of Africa. Man, I am one sad mo-fo monkey, anyway peace out, keep your head out of the OJ.
