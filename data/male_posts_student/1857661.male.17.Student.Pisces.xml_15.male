The Blacks and The Whites (Inez, Kelly, Kevin+Julia, Rachael, Sammi, Eric) sang a medley of I'll Be There (Jackson Five) and  Jeng Tian  (Jay Chou). Ms. Khoo collaborated with the new teacher singing Dilemma 2003.  A group of Form 1 and Form 3 students played some instruments (recorder and piano) led by Yee Xin Le(F3S). 5 malay girls danced through the song Can't Take My Eyes Of You right after it was sang by 2 teachers who are Cik Halimantun and one more teacher. Then, students from Form 5Sc1 sang the song  Lang Hua Yi Duo Duo  by Ritchie Ren. Kah Hor played the guitar. As usual, Pn. Zakiah did her thing where she sang a malay song.  ~ The class party was okay. Encik Samzari wasn't there. Don't know why. We did it for him and he wasn't there. Could have called someone to look for him. The teacher's day celebration became a mess when everyone started throwing cakes at each other. For example, Form 4Sc1.. the prefects were playing with cakes. They dirtied their shirt, with fancy colours. Our class was a mess too. Kheng Loon wiped some cream on Rachael's hair. Wow!  Here are some of the picture taken on this very day...     Ms. Lim and Shook Yee at the field in the morning.      Class picture... but someone is missing...      Yes. Another one.      Ms. Lim again but this time around, she is accompanied by Ai San and The Kat!      Yummy... only after we arranged it properly. No wonder we'r ein commerce class.      The cake... with the word 5K2 on the chocolate topping!      Our basic economics teacher!      Yes. The Blacks and The Whites performing together... for the first time... and the last time...
