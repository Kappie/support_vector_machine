Cleveland reliever, and now interim starter  urlLink Kazuhito Tadano  has been over-powering in his last thirteen innings with 19 K’s a 2.08 ERA, and a .85 WHIP, (8 hits and only three walks). Right now Tadano is filling in for a sore shouldered C.C. Sabathia, but racking up strikeouts at this clip with a nice array of pitches dominated by a nice 90-MPH fastball, makes Tadano someone to keep in mind. Tadano utilizes a throwing motion that makes it tough for hitters to pick-up on what’s coming. At least in the interim, this will be to Kaz’s advantage.   Milwaukee left-hander  urlLink Chris Capuano  is just coming back this June from the DL due to shoulder issues. Right now his control on his fast ball is tenuous, but this has allowed him to further develop his off-speed stuff. His last start came in Colorado where he allowed one run through six with six strikeouts. Capuano has really yet to be touched up this season, never giving up more then three earned runs in a game. This Duke product has proved to be a really smart pitcher, who has illustrated the capacity to evolve his repertoire as need be. Capuano has another start tomorrow against Pittsburgh, so if you’re like me and your gamble on Duan Brazelton doesn’t pay-off after today’s start, picking of Capuano may just save your week and pay dividends for the entire second-half of the season.
