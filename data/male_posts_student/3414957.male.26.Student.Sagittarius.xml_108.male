Its a cruel world but as the old saying goes...how is it again??? Oh yeah its "fuck it".    I installed a cd-rom drive into this computer I am on at work. For some stupid reason, the dvd-r drive didnt want to play any audio files of any type. It read data just fine though. I didn't bring a movie to test that but I have seen other people watch movies on this thing before so I am sure it works. Now at least I've got my tunes to keep me company in the luney bin. Man, soon as I put them on, everyone wants to borrow them because there is only 1 set in this room for everyone to share. Thats not my problem so nobody gets my headphones! They cost me $30!      Murphy...your my hero
