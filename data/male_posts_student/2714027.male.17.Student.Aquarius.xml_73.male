I spent ages playing  urlLink this cool Flash game  and managed to complete it by the end of the day (try beating 85,500 points!). In other news, iTunes Music Store launches in Europe today and I was straight in there, registering and checking out the music. I haven't bought anything just yet, but it's only a matter of time. Goodbye WinMX.  I'm also getting excited about getting a digital camera and the Powershot S60 is looking like hte most likely purchase. It's out in the next two weeks in the UK, with it already on shelves in the US. Should be awesome.
