I would like to submit piece(s) of prose/poetry (or whatever you may call it) written in my dusty notebook from  years past. I figured I could transfer at the very least, productively, some of my insane thoughts  ideas before I could lose this notebook of mine.  Anyways--- I have no clue why I posted that song lyric in this blog when what I only did was cut  paste it on my html based lyrics collection. *tsk *tsk . Weird.
