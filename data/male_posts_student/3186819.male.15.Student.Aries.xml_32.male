By dialing 7-15 numbers you can reach anywhere in the world (some places like Alberta is urban areas you would dial 555-1212 not 780-555-1212. Yeah, like an edmonton to edmonton or surrounding area call. But Edmonton to Calgary? 403-555-1212...... and international calls outside US/Canada you dial +011+country code+area code+phone number) All by pressing some numbers!   What happens when the power goes out? The phone is there! (if you have seen the Bell commercials where it is like "the lights out out, Bell is there"). Why? Well, it is very simple. If you've ever opened the jack in your wall for the phone, beyond where the jack is (the bare wires), you'll notice 2, 3, 4, or even 6 wires. These wires are dedicated, run by the phone company, not by another service. So 2 of these wires are dedicated for your phone. The others are used for another line, DSL, etc. So that still doesn't explain why it stays on. Well, these wires (copper) and then linked to your phone company (copper until a neighbourhood box or even until the switch, or it may be fibre optic or hibrid fiber coax (HFC) cable, or just plain coax. These wires are hooked to the phone company's power supply, not Hamilton Hydro's (or Hydro One, Epcor, L'Eletrical-Poopies Quebec, whatever). So if the power goes out for your house, it doesn't affect the phone company's power. What if the power goes out for the phone company (Thank you goes out to: Dalton McGuinty, Ernie Eves, Mike Harris, gotta love the privatizing and the "promised no hikes in electricity" cough cough......4.3 cents to 4.7 for the first 700kWh and 5.3 (or 5.7) after? Sounds like a hike Dalton.....premier liar!) Well that doesn't matter. The phone company has an EXTENSIVE battery backup and backup generators. Thats nice, but if lightning hits a phone pole, down goes the wires, and cuts the supply, right? WRONG! They are wrongly named phone poles. They carry no phone lines (except in rare cases). Those are hydro poles. Almost ALL of the phone company's wires are burried. So no ice storm, hurricane, tornado (well, maybe a tornado if it rips the box out of the ground) will cut the cord.  So thats good, but how does it all work? Well, the telephone is one of the SIMPLEST devices. It consists of a speaker (what you put to your ear), and microphone (well...the thing to your mouth), a ringer, a duplex coil (so you can't hear yourself through the speaker) a touchtone keypad and frequency generator (the dialpad) and the hook switch (the thing that hangs up the phone). So sure, now you have a phone, but what is beyond those two dedicated copper cables? Well your in luck, cus I know!  So you dial a number. It rings. Someone answers. Why? In the days of the manual switchboard, there was a pair of copper wires running from every house to a central office in the middle of town. The switchboard operator sat in front of a board with one jack for every pair of wires entering the office. Well, back in "the good 'ol days" they actually had a manual, human operated switchboard. Yes, HUMAN! When you would pick up your phone, a little light would shine above your jack on the switchboard. At that point the operator would plug his/her (usually her at that time) headset into the jack and then ask who or what number you would like to talk to. She would then plug your jack into the jack of the person you wished to contact and she would send a ring signal. Then a light would go on above their jack signalling that they were connected. When the call was terminated, the lights would extinguish and the operator would pull the cable out. Very simple, yet a lot of work.   A long distance call was hell for them I bet. You would connect to the operator and tell them the phone number of who you would like to talk to. Then she would call a long distance office, where the operator would be connected to another long distance office, the one for the area code of the person you are calling. Then the operator would tell that office the number, and she would be transferred to that office. This office is the cental office for the person you are calling's area. THEN finally that operator would connect the call. VERY LENGTHY PROCESS. But simple.   Now adays it is more complex but easier to understand, if that makes sense. A box for your neighbourhood containing hundreds (maybe) of household copper wires that will run to a switch (explained in a bit) or to a digital concentrator, which digitalizes it by sample rate of 8,000 and an 8-bit resolution. Then it transmits it with hundreds of other voices through a fibre-optic or coax line to the phone company. If you are calling someone who is connected to the same switch office, it simply hooks the call through using a computerized method of the olden days, all mechanical though. and faster... If its not or is a long distance call, your voice is transferred along with millions of others in a fibre optic cable to the office of the recieving party, and may also travel over satellites and microwaves (not the ovens, but the microWAVES).   Excellent, now you know the basics. Ever wanted a simple two way phone network for fun? Well, in your parents childhood and maybe in yours you may of had the two paper cups and a piece of string, and the sound was transmitted through the string and amplified/concentrated through the cup...Well today you can set up your OWN PHONE NETWORK! all you need are two cheap phones (cordless don't work as well), a 9 volt battery, and a 300-ohm resistor (about $1 at Radio Shack). So you cut open the phone cord running out of both phones (oh yeah, you need a phone cord :P). The red copper wire inside hooks up to the battery (one phone on each terminal, so when you cut the wire in 2, hook up one end on each). Between the battery and one phone you must install the 300ohm resistor to prevent frying. Cut the phone cord as required to use the resistor. Then you plug one end of the cord into one phone, and the other into the other phone. Note you will have to strip the coating to get to the copper wire. Then pick up the phones and your voice will be carried along! Unfortuantely they cannot ring.......They need a 90 volt AC wave at 20Hz to ring. But now you have a little intercom!  Well, I daresay you know about phones now...This post is part of a series on The Simple Things in Life We Take for Granted...Tune in soon for Television and other items.
