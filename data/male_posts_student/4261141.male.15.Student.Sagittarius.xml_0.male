My dad had given me 20$ since he sponsors our team. (it's called Shotgun Shellz) We used the money to get junk food. YUM!! We stayed up until around 11 playing Halo. Then the next morning we were up, dressed, and out of the house by 9. We had to be in Winter Park, at Thumb Fu by 11:30. (we watched SWAT on the way there) We were there by 10:30 and the place was packed!! But we didn't start until around one b/c a team was coming late. There were 17 teams, each with 4 players, we have 7 but were only allowed to bring 4. We didn't get out of there until around 7. When I got home there was no one home so I ended up going to a friends again for the night. Today we finished the movie b/c we didn't have time to watch it all on the way. It was a pretty cool movie, one of my favorite action movies. Well that's it, there you have it sounds fun, huh? O, by the way we didn't do so good because the team got to pick the level and of course they picked their best, and it was best two out of three. So we didn't make it past the first round. The first time we kicked butt though!!! We'll do better next time!!!      Well, thanks for being faithful to my site!!!! Well to Mikes site but I do all the work!!! But anywho gotta run!!      This was Nicole and Mike, Love Ya'll!!
