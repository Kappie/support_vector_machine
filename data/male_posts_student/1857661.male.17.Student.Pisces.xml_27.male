Had to go to Dynasty Hotel near Titiwangsa to attend Jalan Ipoh Girl School's 11th Annual International Understanding Day. That was the most expensive I.U. Day that I've been to. They charged everyone RM18 nett! Well, can't blame them as they're having it in a hotel! But I heard that they have it in the hotel every year. Hm...  richnya !  ~ Some of the higlights of the events were: 1) The dance performances.  2) The food. 3) The decorations. 4) The fashion show.  Well, I thought I was attending a dance fiesta more than an I.U. Day as most of the performances were dances and they even had a dance competition! But overall, it was still a good one. I guess that will be the final I.U. Day that I will attend.  ~ Here are some of the pictures that I took:
