We never had to wait more than 5 minutes for any ride.  The wait for food was the longest wait for anything.. which was funny.  I kept trying to flash my VIP pass to get through that line :)  We got home and I watched the new season premier of Stargate SG1, a great show.  Today we're off to the beach for the whole day... haha!  I'm gonna get tanned.  Below are some pictures of our trip yesterday.   urlLink    Wooly Mammoth on the Mountain  urlLink    Family in Front of Universal Globe  urlLink    Mom and I on the Studio Tour  urlLink    Me going down the escalator  urlLink    Waterworld Live Show
