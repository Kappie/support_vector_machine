Sunday+Disneyland=LOTS of stupid guests=pictures for my site.  Plus, if I can catch any guest stupidity on camera, it's going straight to a MLIP update.  Anyways.  I did end up buying a semi-decent webcam.  And it's fun.  I'll sit there and type, and people will watch me.  Wow!  But for right now, everything's all blah-ness.  I'm stuck at home, and my family left to go watch my little sister play soccer, for reasons I cannot understand.  Oh well, Disneyland is going to be a huge hell-hole.  And my parents decided to buy me an Annual Pass (blah).  Not really what I wanted, since I barely go there anymore.  But, I guess I'll check it out periodically and see if anything is actually open.  I'm probably just going to hang around the arcades for a while tomorrow.  I'll just play DDR for awhile.  Maybe go on like, a few rides.  No big deal though.  Half of them are probably closed.  Oh well.  It's looking like DDR and capturing guest stupidity tomorrow.  Well...I'm bored, and hungry, and I want to play DDR.  So....bye.
