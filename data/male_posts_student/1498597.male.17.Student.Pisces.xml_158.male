So please, stop sendin' me angry letters listin' different ways you want to kill me and what you wanna do with my decapitated body!  Anyway, its about time and got a new blog out there!  Its been awhile huh?  Yeah, I don't need tellin' twice, I've got  Nick  and  Elyse  for that.  Right, well yer prolly thinkin' "Why'd you isolate yourself from the bloggin' community like that?"  Well, first off, I didn't isolate myself, I just didn't really get a chance to blog, or did get the chance, but never took it.  Well, update time!  Hmm, how goes it with you guys?  Still strugglin' by huh?  Me too!  But thats life huh?  I haven't done much.   Summer school  ended like a week ago today.  What?  You guys didn't know I went to  summer school ?!  Whoa, its been that long huh?  Heh, well long story short, I failed  second semester of English 2 , so I had to make it up.  Dunno if I passed my  summer school class ...gotta check up on that.  I had  Mr. Mummert .  Nice teacher, blah blah blah...anyway...yeah that was  summer school .  Yes, it was like hell.  Yes, it sucked.  Yes, I missed all my friends (aww).  But, thats outta the way now...  I'm pretty sure by now that everyone knows that  Josh  and  Naoki  came back from  Japan .  I saw great footage that included a river crab and a suckling baby monkey!  Wow!  They said they brought back souvenirs, but I haven't gotten any yet!  Hey guys, where are the fuckin' souvenirs!?  Just kiddin'.  They brought some great stuff back too.  You wanna know what they brought back?  OK, well....ask them yourselves.  One thing I got accomplished was  driving school .  Yeah, I can go get my  permit  and  license  now, so that means  I'll be drivin' legally from now on ...I'll blog about  my misadventures in the driving class  in a later blog.   Hmm what else?  Oh, nothin' much happenin' on the  Operation: Revolution  front...gotta work on that.  Damn, I am such a fuckin' lazy ass aren't I?   Well, yeah I just noticed I have tons of summer stories for you guys, but we can put those aside for later.  You'll just havta wait I guess.  Don't give me that look, I gave you a lot of practice!  More to come...!
