I say him on c-span the other day, and blabbity blah i'm a catholic with catholic morals and a catholic family and blah blah blah. ergh, he really steams my clams ya know? The only good thing about Johny kerry is that apparently he was a big reagen supporter, which is good, cause we all know that reagen was the man :)
