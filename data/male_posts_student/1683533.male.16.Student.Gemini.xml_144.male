You ask him to put a sweet solo somewhere, and he will, he just loves to play.  We have about 3 songs now, and we want 2 more before we record, and hopefully we will make it there this time.  Then I went to Nick's to finish up the video.  It is really insane.  He does such a good job on editing.  We can turn a history video into a riot.  bye
