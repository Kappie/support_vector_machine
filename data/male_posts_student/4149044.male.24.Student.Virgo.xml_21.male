But things pretty much went downhill from there as I stuffed my face with 11 kfc chicken strips, had dinner at Genroku a few hours later, then pushed my gut to the limit with a half dozen fruit kolaches..on the way home from the restaurant. Needless to say, the abs are currently in hiding. And I don't think they'll be coming back out anytime soon.      Jon's so fucking cool. After we had dinner, he ran to his car to get something out of the trunk. As he walked back towards us, I saw those two wonderful, loveable Czech characters and almost shrieked like a fat hungry chick at the jumbo super buffet. Jon had gone to Czech Stop. And he had brought back kolaches. Fruit AND sausage. Jon's my hero.      I'm so fucking full.
