They made their way through the yard and asked Farmer Giles for two dozen eggs.  While he went off to get them, they had a look around.  They were amazed to find a pig sty fitted out with all the refinements of a five star hotel.  Patio with sun loungers, parasol, swimming pool and a whole range of fine food and drink.  The sole occupant being a very happy, three legged  porker laying back on the lounger and sipping on a tequila sunrise.  When Farmer Giles returned, they naturally asked why the pig was housed in such luxury.  "Well" said the farmer, "That's Perce the Superpig, nothing is too good for old Perce."  The ramblers asked why.  "Last year the farmhouse caught fire in the middle of the night.  Perce raced down the road to the 'phone box, called the fire brigade, then raced back to the house, burst through the flames and carried all six of us to safety.  Nothing is too good for old Perce."  "Wow"  agreed the ramblers.  "And that's not all, six months ago our youngest daughter aged four went missing.  We put old Perce onto it, and he found the trail and followed it to the river five miles away, just in time to see little Sally fall into the raging torrent.  Old Perce dived in, swam 200 yards to find Sally on the river bed, he grabbed her by the hair and dragged her to safety, where he applied AV, got her breathing and carried her back to the farm.  Nothing is too good for old Perce."  "That's the most fantastic story we've ever heard" said the ramblers, "But why has he only got three legs?"  "Well now"  mused the old farmer,  "When you've got a pig that good, you don't eat it all at once."
