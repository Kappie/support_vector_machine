Then today I got up, went to class, bought some books and hung out.  Today we had a meeting to see who we were going to initiate, did that.  Decided I was going to work sat morning so I am off to home to get some sleep and do some reading before work.  Gotta prepare for Toms' birthday on sunday.  Alright well I'm off to shower and go home so Peace...
