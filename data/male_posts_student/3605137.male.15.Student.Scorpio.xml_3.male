     
      Turning away from the darkness, putting the past all behind you, escaping the loneliness a time to change but it all up to you.  Into the depth of the sea, facing a problem that is unforseen. looking for the answer that I cannot see, wishing nothing for what have been.  Regretting the past without any change, taking you nowhere but deeper into your guilt. only you can make the step to renew, and to open up your life rather than to rebuke.     The Sorrow Of My Heart  Sorrow brought me here I am why won't the dorr just close and slam so my wrecked life won't be like this fallen into a deep and dark pit for this I don't want to live rather than live in the dark and lonely pit.
