Anyways unless by accident i slip into a cocacola room I think I'm safe from failing.          I've made the set designs for my LOTR story tomorrow, I have a happy meadow, a flaming dungeon, a corridor, a disco and stage curtains! :D:D:D. It will be fun! Tomorrow I'm also going for a haircut and having my weekly driving lesson. I've got some blue gel that I'm going to put in my hair, should look pretttttttttty cool! You thought I was gonna say pretty didn't you! Teehee. Anyways I'm off to bed!          So Long, Farewell, Auf Wiedersein, Goodybe!          James :P
