Tyke woke up at about 3:48 this morning from a dream that he vaguely remembers being about the topic of life and death and the phrase "I Will Live" written vertically on a napkin.  Other than that Tyke is unsure of what actually happened but he did awake to find that his left arm was completely numb so he got up to try and recirculate the blood in his arm.  About a minute after Tyke got up he heard the phone ring in the other room (he has the phone in his room turned off now) and he thought that he knew what it would be about.  He imagined it was his grandma and everyone else staying at her house calling to say that Tyke's grandfather had died.  It turned out he was wrong but she had called to tell his parents that it seemed he was taking a turn for the worse.  Tyke was somewhat drawn to the fact that he had a dream about life and death and then woke up with his left arm numb (Tyke noticed the connection to a heart attack and subsequently death itself) and then happened to hear the phone ring in the middle of the night.  He certainly found this a striking coincidence if not something more.  But it certainly made Tyke think even more about worldly connections.  Nonetheless, Tyke quickly went back to sleep and woke up at 7 to go to school early in order to get some extra credit by watching Crimson Tide in Sanders.  It is a good movie and Tyke needs that free extra credit so he sacrificed over an hour of sleep for it.  The actual school day was quite annoying.  Math had the arrogant prick teacher back who makes the beginning of the day so unenjoyable.  Then came Government where they had to write 4 more essays.  This was just a total balloon burster as Tyke was thinking they would be doing something in their "study groups."  But no, she made them write stupid stupid essays.  Tyke talked about random stuff in them so it wasn't like he really did them anyway.  Then came a very nice lunch out in the blazing sun.  It was great.  But then there was still another hour and a half of school.  And then Tyke came home.  His mom came home and told him that his grandpa had finally passed away at about 10 in the morning.  So on Thursday he will be going to visitation services at the funeral home and then on Saturday morning and early afternoon will be graveside services and a family get-together afterwards.  Some closure is now being brought.  After he talked with his mom he went down to Farget to get his dad's birthday present and he just got him the Master and Commander dvd.  Then he came back and talked with Doc P and Amed about Senor(ita) Mysterioso(a).  His parents both went to his aunt's house to work on stuff for the funeral so Tyke did his homework and then went to Subway to get himself dinner.  He listened to some religious music he liked because there are a few songs that he really does enjoy.  Then he downloaded some more songs and has now just started watching The Sixth Sense as it is on TV.  It is a good movie for sure.  But Tyke also feels like listening to some Coldplay again so he will probably do that.  Basically some mellow music to go with Tyke's mellow mood.  Unfortunately Tyke is going to have to do his CE stuff tomorrow as he hasn't done any of it yet but that is ok.  He will at least get it done.  But you know what's coming up?  A lot of things.  And Tyke thinks he might go to the baseball game on Wednesday too since it should be good weather and he shouldn't have to do much if any homework.  Well Tyke really doesn't have anything to say today.  It's all pretty much been said before.  Goodnight.
