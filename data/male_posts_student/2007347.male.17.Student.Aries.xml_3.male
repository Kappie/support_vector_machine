Such carnal desires are beneath us and must be controlled.   has anyone actually loved anyone else platonically? Or has it always been Lust with you people?   Yes feel sex desires, but don't let that drive you. Don't let that choose your way of dress. WE ARE MORE THAN SPERM AND EGGS. What's the point of propagating ourselves then if we don't have society and integrity? Just for the sake of it?!??!?!
