I just want to sit here and rot, talking to friends on AIM.  Tomorrow I'm gonna get back in the game though.  I can't afford to fuck around like this.  My mentor asked me an interesting question today.  He asked me why I was different from other kids when it came to academics and work ethic.  I was completely unable to answer him.  All I know is that when I don't feel like I'm the best at something or that I'm not giving something my complete effort, I dwell on it and never let myself forget it.  Other than that, the "why" is missing.
