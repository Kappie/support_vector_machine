Can't say your a loner really, because you just love being around friends and family and making people laugh. You arn't that smart either, but don't blame yourself, it was getting stuck on that rollar coaster for 6 hours straight, going round and round and round...     urlLink Which Boy Meets World character are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I LOVE THIS SHOW, it sucks that they stopped airing it for so long. But as of june 21 it comes back on at 5 on the disney channel, oh yea.
