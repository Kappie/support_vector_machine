Anyway, it's now been summer for 2 1/2 days and It's not been as relaxing as I hoped. Commencement, open houses, relatives - I just want to relax.  Plus, I missed my first Corndog update since I went once a week.  That kinda sucks. At least I had a good time at Erin's open house.  It was too bad Marten and Thomas couldn't make it. OH wel, we'll all meet up at Youth Group at least.  I want to STUFF the MONKEY! ^Can anyone explain this!?!
