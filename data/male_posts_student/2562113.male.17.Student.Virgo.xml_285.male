Katie Tooma on all her accomplishments. Darin, I wish you the best of luck in the merchant marines. It always feels like there’s someone missing at smut gatherings. We all miss you Darin! Some German guy emailed me and wrote “The SMUT has reached Germany.” and pointed out a link to his “Team-Smut” paintball team.   urlLink  www.team-smut.de      funny ass shit. referring back to the “bad night”.. an attack to a smut member is an attack to SMUT itself. Your actions will not be tolerated. You know who you are and you’re probably reading this you fucking coward. The “Porno Bandits” a bunch of smut wannabes have challenged SMUT to a dodgeball game. SMUT has been playing 2 hour games of dodgeball in the past, all I need to say. It’s really disturbing to see how often I smoke. 90 percent of the time I get smoked up for free. Marijuana is bad. Real bad. i’m having an internal conflict with marijuana.. it’s not that I can’t stop. I started in October and stopped in January and really started again when I got home in May. With only 4 weekends left until Albany I think I’m going to really slow it down to the Sunday routine. And when school comes I HAVE to stop because drugs + school = low GPA. Also alcohol + school = high GPA it’s been proven read my previous blogs! One last thing I’ve said this a million times and I’ll say it again. Some people just need to learn how to have fun and control themselves when they drink. Alex got sick Saturday night and almost everyone started bugging out. I got pissed. Party over! Chill the fuck out seriously. Well it’s been fun., until next time.. drink and be smutty!
