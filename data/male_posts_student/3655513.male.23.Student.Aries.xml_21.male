As so at the beggining of every stampede, the Calgary Stampede Parade kicked off the festivities this morning. Now if you are not a native Calgarian, or have no child hood memories to feel all warm and fuzzy about, most would find the parade rather boring. Lots of horses and wagons, wannabe cowboys shooting blanks from their guns, and some local quality floats. Nothing really compared to the Toronto Santa Claus Parade, or the Macey's (sp?) Thanksgiving Parade in NYC. But the thing that sets the stampede and it's respective parade apart is the excitement in the air in the city. Every local business and even the guber-national corporate towers are decorated for the stampede. The usual suit and ties are replaced by Wranglers and cowboy hats, and there are Stampede Breakfasts given out for free everyday by someone different. At night, for those so inclined, the bars, pubs and clubs go nuts with country themes, live performances and special events. All this for a Conklin Fair built around a livestock show and a week-long rodeo. They even gave me the day off of work to "watch the parade". Not too shabby.  So on my day off I fixed a friends laptop, and played a video game or two. Well, that is really just a figure of speech I suppose as really I only played one game. Final Fantasy XI of course, my current obsession. *laugh*  This promises to be a relaxing weekend, and I can't wait to see it through.  BTW did you know that a flock of geese is called a gaggle?
