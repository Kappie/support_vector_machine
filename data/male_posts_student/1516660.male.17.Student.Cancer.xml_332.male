It turns out she woke up at 2.30 (such ungodly hours! and she said I was lazy! Heh! You siow zha bo! :P) HaHa. We went to 768's MacDonalds to meow at the Big Breakfast. Wendy treated me, meow moo. We sat there and talked and talked. I don't wanna go back till 11.30, when my parents are out. HaHa. We talked lor. Talk talk talk. Even Wendy's analysis made sense (oh my god, I forgot what analysis that was! I only remembered it was good. I was thinking about it during bathing. Hmmm!). Meow moo!  Hmmm. I came back at 11.30. Shucks. I didn't avoid my mother after all. Hmmm. She cooked noodles and she went out. I meowed with WQ online. I asked him to come Wendy's house to play MahJong (I am going there at 1). He at first agreed, then he said he don't want to come because it is raining. Meow!!! Qi shu lin!  I got over there earlier than Wendy. I meowed at Lassie and watched Oprah till Wendy and KL came back. Me and Auntie set up the table and tiles first. We mooed and meowed at the mahjong. HaHa. I only managed to Hu twice!! Even ducks meow at me! At one time, I was super super blur. I was smsing WQ announcing my first win, then I think that my handphone was not vibrating, so I sent an SMS to myself. HaHa. I didn't caught on to a lot of happenings. I think I pissed KaiLun off. He kinda snapped at me once. Meow moo!  At 4, KL left to go sleep. Hmm. I read Wendy's W.I.T.C.H. comic book. Oh my my! Their powers developed! So jealous! I want elemental powers to meow and moo! Actually, nah. I may end up abusing them. It is nice to have them, however. Wendy played her FFX. She's inside Sin. Hmm. The enemies are quite tough. Oh well. They are like bosses to me.at this stage of my game la. Even ducks are meowing. Hmm.. I played some too. I tried to fight Dark Bahamut, but I ended up getting killed! Meow moo! One swipe of Energy Ray and...bam! All the cats are killed! Meow moo moo!  Hmm..at 6, I went home while Wendy and her mom went to 888 to eat dinner. I went back, bathed and meowed at the roasted duck. Hmm..I came online and just finished supper.   Quack moo meow! Okay. I dunnoe what to add le, so I think I stop blogging. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
