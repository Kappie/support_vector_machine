See, it's cool because the cup says, "Take Pride In America," but it's ironic because the cup is all messed up and it was just thrown into the street like that, with not much pride at all.  I think I did pretty well in my first attempt at political photography.  Political photography is a very difficult field to pursue, and there were many times during the half-second it took me to take that picture in which I thought to myself, "Why are you even doing this?  There is no future in this.  You'd better get off the street before that Escalade hits you."
