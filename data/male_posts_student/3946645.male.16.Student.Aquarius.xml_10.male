But this is the hardest part, when I get to the actual web design part, then it's gonna be easy.  Hmm, I also learned that my grandad died recently.... on either Thursday/Friday... Why am I only hearing about it now? Well, he was cremated yesterday. My dad wanted to go to his funeral (it was his dad), but he couldn't, because we ahven't got the money, the house isn't sold yet. Also the money was also spent on my CIW course... So, I'm gonna make sure that money will be put to good use, and pass this course and get this qualification.  Hmm, I'm really bored and tired right now, the course is really tiring. That's all I'm gonna say for now.
