I have been fighting against the Federal Mariage amendment as you know, and even though it's not expected to pass I still had to fight against it in any way that I could. I'm not worried about the vote tomorrow, in fact I'm quite confident that it wont pass, but don't me wrong, this vote is as important as any on this issue and we need to let our senators know how we feel about it again and again. I called Senators Carl Levin and Deborah Stabenow's offices today and talked with their aides about the issue. Both offices informed me that the senators were against the amendment and I further pressed upon them that discrimination does not have a place in our constitution, the amendment would take away 1,000 or more rights to gays and lesbians nationwide, and I'm not about to sit back and let it happen. I promise I will do ALL that I can to stop this amendment from ever being sent to the states for ratification, this issue may appear to be over for a while but I can definately assure you that it will come back and I WILL make sure that my voice is herd. I'll drive to Washington DC if I have to, I WILL fight and you can count on it!
