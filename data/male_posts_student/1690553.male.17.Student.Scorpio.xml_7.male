I hate the feeling of being 'disconnected'. If not because of picking up my mum I certainly will not go there. Yesterday I ordered a new pair of spectacle. Not much increase in term of power but the glare factor is up by 50%. I think I need to use LCD monitors after this to reduce the srain on my eyes. For the time being the solution is get a clip-on anti radiation filter for my spectacles. Now I have to wait for the orde to come this Saturday.
