Seems to be the only type of flu I get these days. I always seem to find the best times to fall ill. The last time was just barely a week before my tests last November and now it's during the time that I need to focus on my assignments. Get a feeling that I'm going to be very busy this week. Better blog now in case I don't get a chance to later.  It's strange but only last night, at the end of flu symptoms, did I remember a helpful remedy. I know it's sometimes considered an old wives' tale (heh. Sorry. Detected some irony in the last few words) but honestly, a hot cup of honey and lemon rocks. Makes your breath fresh too! (*winces* yet more irony there)  Gadget News: One of the items on my wish list has just gotten an upgrade! The new version of the  Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen  now comes with USB 2.0 support. Prefect once I upgrade my system. It still can hold 20Gigs of musical goodness and still support 14 hour playback. Speaking of my wish list, perhaps I should post it online...nah, don't want to seem egoistical, or materialistic for that matter.   Col Se  and gang in church have been having some problems with their  Clié's  as of late. I spoke to him about giving me some details so that I can check for them. Have yet to get a response since I wasn't in church yesterday. Will email him again. It's important to help out my fellow  PalmOS  users. I always believe in community in software, hence the Linux. It's quite sad to see that something designed to be simple to use still requires technical support. But it's the way with all devices. Makes me wonder about the more “advanced” PDA's .  Well looks like it's back to work for me. Hope to update again soon. Looks good if I can keep this darn headache at bay.
