Her voice is definatley not the first thing I want to hear in the morning, nor is the washing machine, the vacuum, dishes dropping or pots clanging. It puts me in a shitty mood for the rest of the day. I need a fucking apartment.  On the brighter side of life, yesterday was not too bad. Sure, I was pissed off because I didn't get the day off when I had already paid $25 to go skiing with Crystal, but I did do over $2000 in sales. That may not sound like much, but working at RadioShack, it is, trust me.  Oh look, she's bitching at me again. "Get out of bed" she says. "Let me critisize you some more" she says. "You're a lazy bum with no talent who's never going to amount to anything" she says. blah blah blah blah blah. I would like to stick a sock in her mouth and feed her some sleeping pills.  Fuck.
