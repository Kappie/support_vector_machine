While waiting for the bus I talked to Tasha, Nikki, and Nikki's mom, and decided that we (Tash, NikNik, and myself) should go see a movie tonight or tomorrow. Obviously tomorrow is when its gonna happen. Mike was supposed to give me a call or stop by after his dentist appointment, but I guess he couldn't talk post-op.  So it's just been me, Josh, and the cat. Nothing good is EVER on TV Fridays since NBC killed  Miss Match  and FOX doesn't know what to do with  Playing It Straight . In the next few hours I'm going to find  something  to do else I go crazy. If I could drive I'd go rent a movie or two (or a whole TV series season on DVD). The day's accomplishments have been few, consisting only of cleaning up my nails (they were not so pretty) and getting a good number of the  Jeopardy!  answers correct.  Miss Davika has reminded me that  Pippin  is playing this and next weekend. It easily ranks as one of my most favorite musicals ever, and they pull it off  soooo  well she says.  L-oving it!
