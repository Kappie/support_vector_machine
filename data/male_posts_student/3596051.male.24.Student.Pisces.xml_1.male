It is by the side of the river - Danshuei river, because the river is near the sea, so people can see the Danshuei to take the sea. The other characteristic is tourists can travel to and fro by the ferryboat between the Bali and the Danshuei. Bali was a desolate place before. But that's so different now, the government want to develop the tourist industry so that Bali became a beautiful place. Some people call this place Left Bank of Bali. How do you think^^?  urlLink     八里位在台北縣八里鄉,以前這地方還很荒蕪,不過現在卻變的非常漂亮. 經過大規模的整理之後,變成遊客很喜愛的一個地方,旁邊有淡水河流過,一直到出海口,可以在河畔漫步,騎腳踏車,也可以坐渡船觀賞河上風光 讀了研究所之後,發現到八里的車程不遠,就愛上了這個地方,當不知道要去哪裡的時候,我就到這吹吹風,聽聽水聲,拍拍風景 它甚至還有八里左岸之稱呢!
