This is the perfect place to babble about my insanity, eternally WIP (work in progress) projects etc etc.   Quick background about me first, just call me Smerity =) I'm currently in Year 9 (at the moment with mid year exams in one week *eek*) and have the greatest passion towards computing and other related fields, and reside in Australia.    My main interest at the moment is computer graphics (and art in general), which I do with a fabulous  free and opensource  application called  urlLink Blender!  Blender, other than what the name suggests, is a 3D application, featuring modelling, texturing, animation and rendering capabilities, clutched from the hands of its previous owner (Not A Number, gaming company, and it was closed source) with thousands of Blender users digging into their pockets to raise a 100,000 Euros (I'm Australian, I don't want to deal with conversion rates, but simply put, it's a lot!) Anyway, more info is available onsite, and while the interface is daunting at first, check it out, you'll love it in the end!  BTW, I discovered Google's Blogging service thru a news item on  urlLink Slashdot  (News for Nerds, Stuff that Matters =P) about the curators of Google themselves getting a blog ( urlLink Their Blog Here ), then them linking me to here... Weird huh!    For my first main thought, TERMS OF SERVICE!  While signing up, I read the Terms of Service on the site. Yes, all of it, lots and lots of it =) My main concern was whether they held any rights to my content, which they don't (Thank you Googlers! You guys always treat me right!) thank heavens. But my main thought was how many people actually read those things? Do  you ? I know in my time I've glossed over the contents (and quite often finding I'm not allowed because of being "underage"), but obviously there are times where there might be a serious matter. Copyright issues etc  Just something for you to chew on, and... Welcome to my (encoded into English and represented graphically using a strangely simple and not quite a real programming language HTML) world! =)  Oh, ps.  Terry Pratchett  and  JRR Tolkien  rule! (Both book authors, and if you really don't know who at the very least JRR Tolkien is, do yourself a favour and go grab the Lord of the Rings from the local library! Really, how big a rock are you living under! =P)
