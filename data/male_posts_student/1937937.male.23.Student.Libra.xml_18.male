This is one of those middle of the night revelations -- they provide solace for the hour, and fade away in the mist of dawn.  But I want to hold on to it.  It's evidenced everywhere: I just joined  urlLink Friendster , which is this (buggy) network that allows you to make social contacts.  It appears that about half of my highschool is on there, as well as many people from Haverford.  While I was reading into these people's lives, I couldn't help but compare myself to them.  The interesting thing about comparing myself to others is that I always come out above, or below.  Wherein lies the problem?  How shall I even the playing field?  How can I compare myself to somebody, and not rank myself against them?  I can't.  The problem doesn't lie in the process of comparison: it lies in the thoughts of myself.  That's it -- thinking of myself is, in essence, a waste of time.  There's nothing that comes of it; temporary ego inflation, deflation, whatever -- it's all just fabric for the fodder of my imagination.  How do I stop thinking about myself?  That's a good one!  Lots of people have lots of answers for this.  I find that sitting at Starbucks and talking to a kid who is crazier than I am helps.  Prayer helps.  Writing inventories helps.  God really is sufficient in disposal of affairs.  That's really my goal: to continue to develop a one-on-one relationship with my creator.  And I can't dodge this one: I've got to stand up to my beliefs, and live them.  I can't spew out spiritual guruisms, and then placate my ego with self-aggrandizement.  It doesn't work like that.  I can't placate you by telling you what I think you want to hear, leaving out any mention of God.  And then, the best part of all -- I can't do a damn thing about it.  How am I going to think my way out of my thoughts?  Fortunately, God is greater than I am, and the flow of life is far more powerful than the flow of my thoughts.  I don't believe the new-agers who say that reality is literally a reflection of our thoughts: I think that lends far too much credibility to our minds.  Thinking may be a remarkable process, but the unfolding of the universe is a far more powerful thing.  Then again, ask a quantum physicist what he thinks, and he might tell you otherwise.  But that's for another day.
