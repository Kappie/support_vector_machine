I had to wait so long at the damn secretary of state's office....but then I got to drive home, and I am gonna drive to Hungry Howie's to pick up a pizza.....so yea....everybody better watch out because I am on the road now....no...I am a good driver...just not experienced yet....  Tomorrow the new Riverdale cd comes out...I can't wait...and also we might practice tomorrow...I want to play a show so bad....I think Mike wants a new name to the band...it said something in his profile....I kinda want a new name too....Los Chicas was funny at first...but....it just didn't stick for me....I hope the other guys feel the same way...  well...nothing else to say...later  "Hey...ho...let's go!" -The Ramones
