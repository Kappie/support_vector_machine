One not so significant change(well, may be it's quite), I'll be moving school in one weeks time. And this year, I found my own close friends. I'm starting to even to like pop music.(Kelly Clarkson is good. I just like her voice.) And even developed new habits(like blogging). hehe...I changed my handphone???diao...hehe...it's exciting to change...yeah! But scary too. Saturday, we celebrated Miss Koh's Birthday. It was one of a kind!!! We had a small ensemble to play a Happy Birthday Song composed by Danny and Alvin...and also a fanfare when she cut the cake! So cool!!! It's like a privilege of being the teacher-in-charge for band. Then, after that they were packing up the band room for the move. It was total mess. But it was fun. Then I had to leave early for YF. So turned up there abt 2.40pm. Whoa...quite late. Then we had Bible Study. So cool. We were doing something like sharing the gospel thru the Matrix Movie. Then we read up on alot of parallelisms between the gospel and the movie. Then we learnt about other non-Christian elements inside the movie. It was kinda cool. After that, we had a short time of prayer, and went for training. We did sets. It was so tiring. We did 2 sets of 25 push-ups, 30 sit-ups, 8 burpee push-ups and 30 jumping jacks. It was so tiring, and I'm all aching now. Then we came back, and somehow, still had the energy to play Captain's Ball. I scored one shot...but taking into account that I missed so many, I'm a liability. OK...but I had fun. It's Min Er's Birthday today. I want to buy her stuff. She means alot to me. So happy birthday Min Er! And thanks for everything!!! Today's message was on pride. It hits me...just the theme. Cause I was really really sleepy during the message. But at least I reflected a bit. OK...too mush stuff to cover. I'll leave it like that. I'll make things more exciting. Somehow...change!!!
