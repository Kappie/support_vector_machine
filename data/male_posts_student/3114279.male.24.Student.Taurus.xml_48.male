      Today was my first day at work.  I'm sure I could think of a lot of things to say, but I'm completely exhausted.  I plan on being in bed within the next hour.  I will say that I really love the place and the people I will be working with, and I like the work so far.  I had become so used to sleeping in and staying up late that I didn't go to bed as early as I should have, and was up quite early.  Add that fact to the three hours of paperwork I had to go through this morning and then the overwhelming training this afternoon, and I'm fucking pooped.  I'll post more in the next day or two.
