Got another issue of Entertainment Weekly as well as the latest Maroon Tiger (the newspaper I worked on for two years at Morehouse)....I must say I was kind of taken aback and a little ashamed that one of the articles in the paper was taken directly (word for freaking word) from an e-mail I got....the second annual Profeteezy awards....as I was reading it I was like, "Hey this is familiar"....the current EIC is on my buddy list and happened to be online as I was reading it....just when I was about to send him a message he signed off...come on Geoff!!!....I know ya'll are better than that....we can be original and FUNNIER than some mass produced e-mail that I got twice!!!....don't let me down like that again!
