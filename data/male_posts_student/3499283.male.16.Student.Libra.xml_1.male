The day doesn't even compare to after school so I won't even spend time writing about it.  The excitement started right after eighth period.    Dan V, Raz, and Chris got to experience my driving after school, but not before I made a stupid mistake and pulled out right in front of... you ready for this? Paloma and her mother. Her mom lays on the horn and Paloma yells something out the window.  I couldn't her over our laughter but I'm sure I'll hear about it Monday.  Yes it was all my fault, sorry Paloma.  After taking Dan home, and on the way back into town the biggest bumble bee I have ever seen flies into Raz's window and hits mine.  I'm going 45mph trying to keep the car on the road while this bee is freaking out somewhere down where my legs were.  I hate bees. After maintaining total composure... HA, I pulled over and we let the bee back into its environment.  5 seconds later the bee was outsmarted by the sweet scented bug-catcher bag by the side of the road and is now probably dead.  Serves it right for impairing my driving!!  After that exciting incident we headed to Chris' house and decided to get some guys together and go play basketball down at the Stonebridge pool/park.  We got Noah, and Pat P to join us so we went and played some crazy basketball, later deciding to switch to sand volleyball.    This is where my lack of excellent narrative skills might take away from the ensuing shakedown.  After driving to Jesse's to get a volleyball, only to come back with a soccer ball, and having my car blasted with sand by Pat and Noah, an intimidating group of about 10 fifth graders began to gather up by the pavilion.  About halfway through the following incident Chris realized just how much this resembled the cast of Lord of the Flies, so I will begin by substituing the kid's actual names (which I don't even know), with their respective character in the Lord of the Flies.    The whole thing began with a simple attack on our authority.  A chubby boy with badly bleached hair, lovingly renamed Piggy, snobbily asked "How can you play volleyball with a soccer ball??"  The rest of the boys then proceeded to rally behind this youngster in expressing how dumb we must be and how since they outnumber us, they could take us.  At this point you don't even understand how confused we were.  "Jack", a kid with a small head and a hawk-like expression, also the 'ring leader' of the "mini-pimps", was intent on making us aware that he could hit us with his tennis ball.   ALright, side note. The thing that makes this so uncool is that we didn't feel right retaliating.  I think there's something about a five year age difference that qualifies for child abuse, so there are no funny comments about us ramming their heads into the pavement; it was pretty much a one sided battle.  Anyways so Jack and "Roger" ended up coming over to chris and took his shoes which he had taken off to play sand volleyball.  They quickly filled them up with sand and confiscated his socks.  Simon gracefully returned Chris' shoe and now is probably being torn apart by his gang for such traitorous acts. Chris' other shoe was taken by Jack and thrown up into a tree, but then "Ralph" stayed behind and showed me where it was so I could hit it down with the soccer ball.  I faced a simliar problem.  When I wasn't looking Roger took my FootWarmer moccasins that I like to drive in and made it the base of a sand pyramid.  Inside of the shoe is fleece so there is now sand imbedded in my driving shoes. Why didn't we bring our paintball guns???!  Razvan didn't get his shoes filled with sand... Jack hit him in the balls from 3 feet away with a tennis ball.  Jack ran. Razvan hit the ground.  I thought that he was going to turn into some super being and rip their heads off, but he amazingly kept his cool.   This was all compounded with their sand throwing and gangster backtalk.  It was disgusting.  We finally decided to just get in the car and go home after Noah and Pat P had to leave.  Well it was one of the most interesting thing thats happened in a while, and a perfect example of how kids are filthy savages, mwahahaha, some much more than others, and also how younger kids are growing up way too fast.  I wouldn't have known half the things they did when I was in fifth grade. I didn't know what gay meant, i didnt know all of these swearwords, these savages knew them all. And I didnt have any bling bling :(. Oh well, hopefully more interesting days will come this weekend, but its been quite a Friday. 5 full days of school left, yearbooks wednesday.  Peace  Chad
