Mike pulled me off to the side to tell me I was gonna start frying soon since I have seniority over all the other dishwashers.  But the catch is I need a hairnet or an extreme haircut.  I could never cut it to the length he wants it, so it looks like I get to be the fashion statement at Hope's with an insanely hot hairnet.  So, tomorrow is my grandma's b-day so I will be visiting her and such tomorrow.  also, I'm getting warped tour tickets tomorrow.  Nick wants to do hardcore filming, so my schedule is gonna be tight this week.  preview the  urlLink new greenday song , I still need to hear it, I will get on that after this.  comment if you please
