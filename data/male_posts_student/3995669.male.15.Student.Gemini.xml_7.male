Kaitlin and I were talking the entire time and Toby could barely get a word in. It was pretty amusing. Also - previous to that, I was alternating between "urgent messages" which included topics such as deodorant, lava lamps, and bladder-control-challenged foster children with Abby and Kaitlin on the phone.  Aren't I hysterical?  Random Thought: Why don't security sensors cause holes in garments? Are they magnetic or what is going on?  I like ... rainy "first kiss" scenes in movies. I hate ... cheap people.
