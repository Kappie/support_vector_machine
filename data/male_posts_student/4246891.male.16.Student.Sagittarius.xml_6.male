My father agreed to fetch me and I decided to go home on friday since we won't have any practice in the Glee Club on Saturday... I'm excited to go home 'coz I've got lots of things to get and do! Perhaps, I could start my shadring about my untold stories after I finished the essay Apple is asking me to make! I hope she would like it and it could make her win for the essay writing contest she would like to join in... Well, nothing more to write. I've still got to make a testimonial for my friends in friendster. Hey! Add me or could you please make me a testimonial? hehehe! ThanKs! Bye! I still have a class today at 1 pm - Theology Class!
