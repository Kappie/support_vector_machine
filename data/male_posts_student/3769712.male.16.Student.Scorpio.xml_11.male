To explain how it works would be ludacris, to say the least it uses Torrent files. So random it could be a Family Guy commercial. From talking about having to buy your own car to a "Kazaa system thing".    P.S. Almost like a "Simpsons" episode, like  it start somewhere and ends upin the  small cafe outside of Havana,Cuba drinking  Chinese Cut Black Tea with lemon zest. (WTF, just let it slide buy, that brass  monkey ....thatchunky monkey. Lmao)
