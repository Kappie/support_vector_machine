Anyway, this is a survey I found on Loren's blog.  The answers are mine though.  Enjoy.    *What do you most like about your body? My brain.  *And least? My "Jewish muscles" as Seth would say.  Though I pack a punch against smaller kids (you don’t want me to be your babysitter)  *How many fillings do you have? Three?  No idea.  Between zero and three.  *Do you think you're good looking? Oh yeah.  You want this.  *Do other people often tell you that you're good looking? You kidding?  "Were you or Lenny ever named People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive?"  "Well, I don’t know about Lenny..."   FASHION:  *Do you wear a watch? Yessir.  I used to have a watch that was so thin everyone thought it was fake.  And then it broke.  So it was.  *How many coats and jackets do you own? Two.  Winter and Fall/Spring.  *Favorite pants/skirt color? Uh, dark blue.  *Most expensive item of clothing? My diamond tiara, obviously.  No.  (Looking in closet...) Maybe my suitjacket.  My lone falling-apart suitjacket.  *What kind of shoes do you wear? Go Merrells.  I hadn’t tied my shoes in so long when I got boots for the Tanzania training mission, I practically forgot how (no laces).   YOUR FRIENDS:  *Do your friends 'know' you? Well.  Maybe Loren or John.  *What do they tend to be like? Um, what’s that supposed to mean?  The good ones are like John Kerry, the bad ones are like Aaron Burr.  *Are there traits in you that are universally liked? My girlish charm.  *How many people do you tell everything to? Depends what you mean by "everything."  Four people know my sensitive information.  I guess one, Loren.   GENERAL QUESTIONS:  *Who is the smartest man alive at the moment? Duh.  Me.  Matt Woolf is a far second.  *What do you prefer, a sunny or rainy day? Sunny.  I like rainy nights though.  *Do you consider yourself lucky? No such thing.  *Do you feel pity for people who commit suicide? Nossir.  The stupid can weed themselves out, though it is against the law (do I hear a bum BUM bum bum bum bum bum coming on?).  *Choose one word to describe how you feel most often: Tired.  *Do you own any plaid clothing? You betcha.  One of my favorite shirts (oh no, I’m turning into the pedophile again).  *Do you own converse shoes? I think we’ve gone over this.  *Do you own saucony shoes? I don’t have more than one pair of shoes, alright?  *Do you own old school nikes? I’m a white Jew...  *Do you wear tight pants? Likely story.  Jeans are the only way to go.

Not even in my cargos.  *Crush: I think four of you know the answer to that.  *Virgin: I would hope so.  *Natural hair color: Brown.  *Current hair color: I’m a Democrat; I’m not a punk.  *Eye color: Brown.  *Height: 5'4.5" at my last doctor’s appointment.  (Conan: How tall are you, anyway? John Tesh: I’m two meters.  Conan: Two meters?  How many kilos do you weigh?)  *Weight: 112 lbs.  The metric system sucks out of a straw.  *Birthplace: Newton-Wellesley Hospital.  Which is entirely in Newton, by the way.  *Shoe size: Um, US 9 according to my tongues.

One of the two good PBS shows.  *What is the last song you heard? Right now I’m listening to “Battle Flag” that they use on NBC promos and in the episode of ER where Carter got stabbed and shouted out but the song was so loud that no one could hear him.
