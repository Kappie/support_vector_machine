Don't ask how, it's really none of your business - let's just break it down to the fact that when they say you should use a static wrist strap, they're right - but it still won't do fuck all if you try to overclock a 400 to 1.2 land. So I have a crispy GTS Pro and a smoked 30 Gig Maxtor 7200.  As you can probably tell, I wasn't really using either for anything - but thankfully I have futureshop's superkeen over the counter exchange program. So I got me a brand new GeForce4 Ti4200 and a Sound Blaster Audigy 2. (didn't need another hard drive anyway).  Popped those in, the upgrade ran smoother than butter. That's a first. Guess they're all starting to get the hang of this whole "plug and/or play" thing. So my computer posts around 14000 on 3dmark2001se. That's pretty rad. Go me, go me, go go go me.  So I'm really starting to get excited about gameboy stuff. First there's the advance 2.0. And there's also the  urlLink Gameboy Player  which lets a user play gameboy games on their gamecube (and hence, on their bigscreen TV).  Nintendo - you may not push the most polygons, but between Mario, Zelda, Metroid and the Gameboy - you've got my dollar.
