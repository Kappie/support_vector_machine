My history teacher, ***** ******* gave us a research project which was of course at least 15 pages. I have been working on this project since Tuesday. Tuesday is the same day I stopped doing my essay. Since, there was so much to do but there was no little time, I couldnâ€™t get my essays done. I have to get good grades in this research project of history because I have to achiever many adcademic goals of mine.
