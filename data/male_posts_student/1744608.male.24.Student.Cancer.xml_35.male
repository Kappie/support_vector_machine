It makes providing syntax highlighted code samples on your web sites a trivial task. The code samples have a professional appearance and are easy to read. You essentially tell the ASP.NET CodeHighlighter web control what code to highlight (either by inserting it inline or by programmatically setting a Text property) and in the rendering phase of its web page it outputs the code in syntax highlighted format. Custom language definitions may be developed for the control and code outlining is even supported."
