He's a director/writer with an encyclopedic grasp of the history of cinema, pop culture and all things human.  He's a dork, a geek and a genius.  On the 10th anniversary of the release of his first great event,  Pulp Fiction , I salute you Mr. Q.  Thanks for knocking down the walls and lighting the crevaces.
