They have three screenshots and my god... do they look impressive! And I come to read the small letterings next to the picture, "The game itself is 96K..." I was like XO! NO WAY!  I quickly got on the web and searched for the demo game (As they didn't include any link in the magazine). I came across Breakpoint 2004 Competition (in the magazine they also mentioned it) and proceeded to download the beta game.  I fire it up! BOOM! It is real! Considering it's only 96K in file size the in-game details are unreal! Whomever coded this game really makes John Carmack look like a kid on pacifier. (KIDDING!)  I used to be into demo scene but since I joined the Army I've lost contact. Today I found several very nice sites that is dedicated to demo scene and I downloaded 1.4GB of demos tonight.
