First of all, most of my classmates are off on a fieldtrip, so in two of my classes, we won't be doing anything at all! In the other two classes, we don't do any work at all anyways, so it don't matter. :) Oh ya, I only have four classes.  I'm sitting in 3D Art class right now, typing on a SLOW computer while I should be doing my monster project >:). About that, the blog for it is at  urlLink This Blog .  Check it out in a few days, and I should have updated it at least once.    Furthermore, today is good because the Matrix: Reloaded comes out today :-D. Check it out at   urlLink The official Site   Erm, for now, I don't have anything else to tell y'all, so I'm off.  Later.  --Clash
