Basically, what it's supposed to be is a competition where every country votes for a song to represent them in the inter country competition broadcast simultaneously throughout the union. After all the countries have performed live, everybody gets a chance to vote by phone for their favourite song except their own. Once this has been done, each country gives points to the others depending on the votes. From 12, 10, 8 to 1. The country with the best song and the most votes wins a trophy and gets to host the next competition.  This is all very well in theory, but the reality is very different. Basically what it boils down to is that every stereotyping of every country you have heard of is right. For example, this year, the Italians decided not to compete. This was because Italy considers itself the home of fine music (after all they invented opera) and as such they are quite put out that they have never won the competition and they're not going to play any more. the British can't understand why they never win any more even though they clearly have the best song every time. Also, they like to remind everyone that they used to win it all the time in the good old days, and that's all that counts. The fact that the winner gets a fine trophy is completly ignored in the face of what is going to become basically a full evenings worth of a free plug for the country (and the do make it count at every possible moment during the competition. The prestige of being the winning band is effectively nil.  The absolutely most hilarious part is the voting system. Alledgedly, it is all done by the phone votes in the country, but a few suspicious coincidences have been noticed. For example, the countries that are all around one another in the Balkans, the former Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey all seem to have a system where they vote for one another. The Scandanavian countries also have a little system as do the formar USSR. Seriously odd. It seems also that people look at the style of song that won the previous year and just copy it. These never win. After a while you can pick where the votes are going before they are announced. Added to this we have Terry Wogan being incredibly sarcastic and desparate local television personalities who have never had sucha large audience in their lives. Ridiculous.  It's in Ukraine next year, and daft as it is I wouldn't miss it for anything  Jack
