I worked Monday – Thursday morning, and then on Friday, we drove to KNOTTS BERRY FARM! It was so fun! Then Saturday we went to the beach (pictures coming soon), and Saturday night we went to the Dodger – Rockies game at Dodger Stadium. It sucked, the Rockies lost. Oh well. No biggy. They won last night, so it is all good. Then we drove back last night. I got to drive from Baker to Home. We ate lunch at Bun Boy in Baker, home of the world’s tallest thermometer. It was cool I guess. Between Baker and Vegas we saw a car on fire, and no, not just the engine, THE WHOLE DAMN CAR! It was cool! Anywho. That was my Spring Break.
