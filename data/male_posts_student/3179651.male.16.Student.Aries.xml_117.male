My paycheck gives me money from the last 2 weeks so in my first week of work I made 241 bucks ($205.68 is mine after taxes)  This Saturday I worked  12 fucking  hours with one break. Yep, and I bet I lost some money because my tips sucked...  I originally planned to buy a $1,500 computer because my dad said he'd pay half. Since my brother already bought a cheap one that he replaced already cause it sucked, my dad told me he wasn't paying that much. So, I;m buying a barebones system because then all I need is a video card, but the asshole wont pay 350 now that I make money. If this were my brother he would have gotten it. The barebones system is really good though and is 682 total + shipping.  Bean, I'm calling you, be ready.
