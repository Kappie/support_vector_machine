It is quite the quandary, because the first inclination I'm sure is yes. But then when you think about science or other significant explinations you may begin to doubt your answer. I don't believe there is a right or wrong answer to this question, but my answer is yes, I do believe in miracles.   Dear Beach, I wish i was staying at you tonight instead of here with my big gulp neighbors. the ocean sounds a lot more appealing than big loud firework explosions.  is anybody else highly afraid of fireworks or am i just a loser?   today was fun. sat around and enjoyed an awesome summer day, like you enjoy a candy cane durring christmas time. went to soccer. got my butt kicked. time to get in shape neil. yessir.   oh to be an ostrich, what a wonder that might be.  g'night.
