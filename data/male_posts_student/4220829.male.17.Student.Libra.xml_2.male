I haven't writen since Saturday, and you have both seen the site. I don't know how reguarly you will visit, but I will leave that up to you.  Yesterday I woke up at 6:20, and had a shower. I got all my shit togeather, then I went in to see Mum. I went in her room and SHOCK!!!!!!!! Her eyes were swolen up and she couldn't see anything. She had conjuctivitis. Poor thing, she stayed home, but she sems to have gone to work today, damn her slave driver bosses!  She gave me some money for the train and to pay you back Natasha, then I left with Ellie to the station. We bantered about her school, she was saying that there are heaps of gymnasts there, they have one peroid of classes in the morning and one in the afternoon, then are bused off to an executive school to learn gymnastics. She said that a friend of hers used to do that but now she can't afford it so she is in normal classes with Ellie.  We got on the train, and Ellie got off one stop later, at Newport. She met up with two other Melbourne Girls, and forgot about me straight away, thanks a bunch.  I was standing at the exit doors, so I could see the whole carrage. There were lots of tired people, one that stood out was a beutiful blond woman, she looked like a snow princess (I have no idea what the fuck that means, but then again, I am currently eating mni chicken dim sims, so it all makes sense). She was looking out the window, and was sitting in a 6 seat caral by herself. I stared at her for about 10 minutes, during which time I thought some crazythoughts- the main one was that I would find out where she lived by getting up really early, going to Werebee, then catching the train to the city and finding out what station she got on the train from, then getting off ot that station and waiting there for the day, then at night when she got off I would follow her home and serenade her from the street. There were five other guys in the carrage who were staring at her, probably longer that I was, and it was at this point that I realized that woman have such massive power over men. It has happened to me many times- at Wesley was the first major fuck up, at Clunes. Then at Imax, and now at Prinny Hill I am not willing to go through it again, so I'm not going to do anything that I might have were I somebody else   hehe, that guy is cool!  Anyway, I got to school at about 7:50, bought some soothers to ward off conjunctivitis, then saw you Natasha! We walked upstairs, and as usual we sat at the special table in the study area that looks over the courtyard. We chatted for a while, saw Mr Johnson walk across  the basketball court with his funny tibetan beanie, then Amy arrived. I'm not sure why, but she never spoke to me or looked at me, solely at you Natasha. It has been quite a while since I have spoken to her. Just before the bell, Fredrick arrived. We greeted him offhandedly. I can't remember the exact context, but you(Nat) said he had a small dick. He went red, and Amy (and I to a lesser extent) laughed heaps. He walked off, and we went 2 english.   I asked Justin whether he thought it would be allright for me to go to the student anti-john Howard protest, he said the zoo excursionn was compulsarry part of the course, and said it was my choice to make-just like that catholic minister in the IVF philosophy video.  After that we had International Studies, Farral was as usual a bitch . We had home group, and oddly rane walked in and said "Excuse me, just wondering if this homegroup was 11E"? She is an odd one, Castlemane eh! Then at recess, heaps was going on with you two under the stairs, so Fred and I went 2 the shop, then the park. We went with Tim. On our way back to school, we met up with Freg, Matt and Teishan, all of whom stayed in a seperate group to Fred, Tim and I on the way back to school. Teishan and Matt are starting to realize they don't like me. :p   Period 3 was legal, it went by slowly and painfully. The year 12 football hicks that sit next to me were discussing anal sex and their girlfriends-one was saying his cock had slipped while he was having sex doggy style and had gone in her arse, she ran to the other side of the room and screamed "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING!?!?!?!?!?!" Another was saying he was trying to coax his girlfriend into having anal sex by saying he would 'lube up'. Anyway, it was gross.  Period 4 was Biology, and Mr Collins was in a wheelchair. The guy is insane. He has been teaching at Prinny Hill for 35 years, and still isnt principle. RETIRE BUD!  I had a really cool talk with Leo, my Vietnamese friend about the Viet Kong, eventually the bell went and I walked to the lockers. Alice saw me and hurried over. "Hey, get your lunch quickly, we have to gett out before Teishan comes". I hurredly opened my locker and just shoved my books in there, didn't have time to get my lunch, then ran downstairs. I met up with you(N), Alice and Fred, and we were about to leave when we said "where is Emily?' Hmmmmm, if there is one thing I have learned about you Ms Shaw, it is that you take your sweet time at times. Fred went in to rescue you, when he didn't comeback after 5 minutes I went in.   Lots of people were milling around the foyer, what happen next was like a scene out of an action film. You (E) were walking downstairs slowly. Teishan was with his year 12 ho's under the stairs, and saw you, and Fred was reaching out for me "get out, Teishan has seen Emily". Too late, I motioned to you (E) to come outside, Fred glared at Teishan, who was standing up, and we sprinted out of the foyer. You(N), Alice , Ruby, Alex and Max were already past the bike racks as we burst out, I yelled "RUN, RUN, RUN, RUN"! And I sprinted past you all and came to rest around the courner. We lost him, thank christ.  Coffee at Filous was ok, it was nice to be away from dickheads like Teishan and Matt, but unfortunately I didn't have any money. Ruby offered me some, but I made some bullshit excuse up not to, gentlemanly of me eh?  We finished and walked gradually back to the park, Alex and Max invited me to go to some anime thing at the nova, I said I would be interested in going, but had heaps of homework so probably couldnt go for the whole weekend.   We got to the drain thing that we usually sit on at lunch, but left just about immediately to get back to school on time. Got my books from my locker, then went to Philosophy. On the way I caught up with Hatters quickly, he said I could do my speccial political thing. WICKED!!!!!!!!!! I walked into Philosophy, and found you(N) sitting between Mia and Steph, with the only avalable seat next to Teshian. NOT HAPPY JAN.   Luckely I didn't have to sit next to him, because we went to the park for the class, very uni philosophy, but I enjoyed it. Matt made some unusual comments like "what does it matter if an animal feels pain all its life"? Rain and Isobelle had an argument with the rest of the class about banning smoking in pubs, then we walked back to the school.   Last period was classics, I sat next to Pearl, who said she was going to paint charicters from the video on Athens that we were watching, she ended up painting a flower (a good one too).   I got my International book at the end of school, then left with you (N). We got downstains at 10 past 3, waited for 5 minutes (we could see you[E] pashing Paolo, so we waited outside the school entry), then had to go.   We had a nice chat, but I couldn't see you(E) coming, I assumed incorrectly that you had gone with Paolo. We got to the boule club and Matt rode up in front of us. "I carry a message from (queen) Emily, should I tell you it"? "Whatever Matt". "Halt". "We can't, we are going to be late for Tanya". "Oh, ok". He rode off. We continued to walk, and you(E)and Matt caught up with us. You seemed as pissed of with us as I was with you two on Saturday. Natasha and I walked off, leaving you again with Matt. We picked up Tanya and Freg (unusually he seems to pop up afterschool regularly), and waited for the bus. It came, and you(N)left.   The conversation I had with you(E) and Matt was unusual. I was the one doing most of the talking. I was saying how I had been bullied because of my weight, Matt was quite taken aback by my frankness. He said he was going to the anime thing too, and then he invited me to his place. I declined as I wanted to straighten things out with you (E). I hope we began to.  Anyway , I've been writing this for three hours, time to finish up.  I think that the three of us are really good friends, and I want to keep things that way.  John
