It only hit me last week that i still had results to get but im not as nervous as i was this time last year, where i was in the foetal position round about now.  Most people know that ive had a bit of a shite year for one reason or another and during that time exams were not really high on my list of troubles, so i took a much more lackadaisical attidude to my studies than in years gone by.  As a result i dont imagine i've done as well as in previous years, so i'll give you my predictions: Advanced English C or Fail, Modies B or C, Info Systems C or Fail, Psychology Fail.  Although id love to do well its not really important and i dont claim to be as in bad shape as some of my comrades whose entire futures will be decided in just a few hours, so i'll shut up now as a mark of respect.  I will however wish said comrades the best of luck as it reaches the zero hour.  So, on with more pressing matters... why is it that parents these days bequeath upon their children ever more outlandish names. There is simply nothing more hilarious than a beast of a woman with tattoos and a thick Scottish accent yelling at the top of her huge lung capacity the name 'NIKITA!!!' or 'AINSLIE!!!'. Genius! Do they think it will make their offspring more sophisticated? Do they really think the names are pretty or that it gives the child class in some way? I would go back to school if i could just to make fun of the new breed of amusingly monikered youth. Good times would be had. Anyway,  another entry will follow tomorrow to tell of how i fared in my exams. Cheerio.
