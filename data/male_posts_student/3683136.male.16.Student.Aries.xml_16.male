Katie is laughing hysterically at the events unfolding.    This is the party in Sarah's basement. This is the party that's occuring in my mind.    Another screwdriver down the hatch. Another chuckle at the happiness that Mike couldn't join them.    I am Mike's Pariah.    I sit at home, by myself watching crappy television. This is my life. I type on my laptop. I self-indulgently think about the people who read this. I wish I were famous. I wish I had lots of money. I want to be a hollywood celebrity. I want to be worshipped.    I pat myself on the back for immitating chuck palahniuk.    I am Jack's stolen mind.  _____________________________________________________   For the record, most of what I just wrote is entirely sarcastic. I just had that thought in the car today, "My friends are having the time of their life. This is all occuring in my head." Or some such nonsense... decided to write.    I am Mike's failed attempt at writing something meaningful.    -Mike    The time is right,  but I feel all wrong.
