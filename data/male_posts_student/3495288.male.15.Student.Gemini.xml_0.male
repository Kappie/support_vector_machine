Tired and sleepy, I went to do my homework. I forced my self to do so. I finished everthing at around 5 in the morning had only a few minutes of sleep. Once i woke up, cranky and really super tired, i took a bath and got ready for school.     When i came to school, Syariff (the class chairperson) said that the dance practice will be at the class room, the main reason is that he don't want to go out and coz he has a small dance battle with the next class. Thats the first last minute change. During silent reading period, at the parade square, my form teacher called me and talked to me about the class. Yeah something like counsiling.     He asked me about my life, how is the class and blah blah blah. In bio class, my bio teacher asked us to do the Ten year series as usual i always finish the assignment first cause i am the top student in bio class. Than she told me that there is no prize and apologised, that was the second last minute change. During Geo class my teacher asked us to line up at the parade square. I brought along the letter that the director passed to those dancers who did not attend anything in school or what ever. I showed it to her and she say ok i am excused from the punishment. Got back to class leaving 9/10 of the class under the hot sun.    There were only 12 students in Geo class. We did study. Than after Geo was English banded. I went for my banded class, just next door (Eng Band A). Mr Bruce told everyone that he will show a movie but he did not instead he asked us to do a lame quiz, the third one, than while we did the quiz he went to get our eng files. When he came back, he asked me to take the ones that are from my class so i did... Suddenly he took it back and said never mind i ask Syariff to pass it, that was the FOURTH!.     Recess time came. Ok after i eat i always walk around. I went back to the canteen and talked to my teacher after that i quickly stood up and bumped into Kok Siang. He hold me by my arms and my hand we on his chest. He blushed. I let go and turned away from him.     Maths lesson was next after recess. We received a new time table AGAIN, thats the Fifth one!. I was not turned down in maths lesson cause i was bored and did not care much. Than after school, I got irritated of waiting for some people. There is this girl, she left her bag in school and left the school with out letting me know. She did not came back after that, that was the sixth!. During the break i went to Syariff and said to him to FUCK THAT BITCH OFF THE GROUP! He kept asking me why... i just repeated the words i said THREE TIMES. If i say FUCK OFF once means a warning, it is three times means REALLY REALLY FUCK OFF!     Than i went back home at around 5 plus. I fell asleep once i lyied down on my bed. Woke up by a phone call. It was Him. He told me he couldn't go to the concert, if he goes he has to ask roy to call his father, that was the seventh!. Than i got irritated cause i have been turned down 7 times in one day. I had a good sleep. I am totally having an alter-ego in me. AH! FUCK! My schedule is so tight now!    After that i went out and talked a bit to him on the phone than put down. i went to west mall while on the journey i broke into tears and this guy came up to me and asked me if i was alright but i did not answer but at least he gave me a packet of tissue. Than i went home after a long walk, i went to the roof of my block and sat there. Than i went for another walk... when i went back to my block i feel uneasy and all of a sudden this guy hold me up. I thanked him and i went home.. and than now... here i am writing this blog. Haiz... FUCK!
