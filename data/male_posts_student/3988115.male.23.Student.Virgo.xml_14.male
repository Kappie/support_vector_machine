You have probably seen the absolutely enormous plant in our backyard and grows freakishly larger every week. It looks like this:      urlLink                And yes the swingset next to it is naturally dwarfed. Anyhow I was out in the backyard today and noticed that the top of our freakish plant was covered in seed-pods. I went and got my brother to show him how much bigger this plant had gotten and he had a brilliant idea. Here is a problem at our house: Mowing the "garden" (a plot of land overgrown by a furious variety of thick and persistent weeds). We have come upon a solution: taking these seed pots and covertly planting them all throughout the garden so that suddenly it will look like this:    urlLink            No more grass or weeds = no more mowing. Won't our mom be surprised when she looks out the back window one day and sees a veritable jungle of asian trees...
