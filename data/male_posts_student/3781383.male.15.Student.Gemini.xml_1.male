My life can be interesting at some points, and sometimes it isn't.  I play JV lacrosse for my high school and next year i will most likely make varsity because my postition (defense) will be needed.  Follow my life as I walk through the halls of Davison High School and battle with depression, weight loss, girls, and homework.  Right now it is the summer and I am leaving in three days to spend a few weeks up at my cabin on Lake Gogebic.  There are some nice places to eat *cough* and drink *cough*.  I have my driving permit so i can drive with a parent.  That makes me the designated driver.  I might post tommorow and then I'm off.  See you in 3 weeks.
