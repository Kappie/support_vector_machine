I apologize for the, no doubt, sleepless nights spent pondering this blog... Back to business   First things first: In the Tech Corner....     (these are the said Epiphanies)...     I have solved all of the wireless networking issues and soon will be installing the wired and wireless network at geoff's house tomorrow...That is if all things go well!     I rebuilt two of my uncle's computers and got them running while cleaning the drive of a friend who will soon be needing her files...     Other than that I've been shopping for new power supplies for two unlucky souls and some  Pimped  out cooling equipment for my already monstrous rig!  urlLink Here!  It's near the bottom (and the only one with 7 case fans...and a pic!!!)   In the rest of my life....    I'm finally coming out of the hard part of my recovery from the wisdom teeth-ectomy and can begin my solid food diet once more!  I even dared to eat pizza the other day!!! ( I know I'm just such a dare devil)     With no more pain meds keeping my head in the sky and my reflexes God knows where, I can play the guitar with my moderate talent again!  Today's picks were Moe., RCHP, and Weezer.       I was also so inclined to finally install a phone line in my room...Yes, people, I know it's amazing that a state-of-the-art-not-quite-turn-of-the-century-patchwork-parsonage doesn't have grounded outlets and phone connections in each room but it is true!     Consequently, I found my drill! :)     Well folks, I've had enough of me for one night...er..um..morning at any rate,, Good night and sweet cuppin' cakes //Stephen  //Needs more REM statements //See me after class Mr. Heagy!
