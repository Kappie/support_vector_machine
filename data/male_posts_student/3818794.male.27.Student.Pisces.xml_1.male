Apparently I was more worried than I realized because I had a dream where I was riding a very small car and crashed into the back of two other cars on the way to the gym. One was driven by the cute boy I saw at work yesterday and the other by Jessica Simpson. We found ourselves sitting on a balcony discussing the damage. Before I knew it I was crying because I was uninsured (yeah right!). The cars were wrecked but Jessica offered to lend me the money to get a new ride so I wouldn't miss my gym appointment. Then I rode a new tiny car to my friend Franks house where he was sleeping. I proceeded to take a hurried shower and then zipped out the door and down the highway. I never made it to the gym.   Friggin' bizarre.  ------------  On a better note, I did actually go to the gym this morning - it was awesome!
