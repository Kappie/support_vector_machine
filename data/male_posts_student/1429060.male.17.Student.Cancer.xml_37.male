I know where and when we are in our lifecycles; we are at that unfortunate conjunction between kiddie-hood and adult, a point at which our superiors demand responsibility and respect and understanding. And we are supposed to become "adults" ourselves. But let me propose this question. How are we to make time for the adult's activities of self-development when, as it is, we are buried in school and, if that isn't enough, we have our own developing lifestlyes, thank you very much. We are confused because, here, we are pressured to be the best, because we are aging, and look at your older sibling who was so perfect! (Ask Elise). On the other hand, we have those people - many of the same people who say that we should be responsible - who look at us [teenagers] like scumbags, beating us down because, hey, we're not even adults yet. Getting the dramatic contradiction?  This means that teenagers sometimes just can't do everything that is expected of them, especially when their environment is bearing down on their shoulders with raised hackles. I have a younger sibling (thank you very much), and I  cannot  take care of him every second of his/my existence. Why am I expected to "play fair" and "be nice" and "treat him like an equal" when he is doing his best to make me mule-kick him? Unfair circumstances can revolve both ways, remember that.  Another thing. Not all teenagers are alike. We are not all shoplifting, pill-popping, weed-smoking, sex-driven beasts. Albeit, there are some of those base creatures crawling the earth's surface without right. Those are some of the people you can find in the penitentiary or on the streets, robbing old ladies and raping young ladies and killing ladies and men and laughing about it. But teenagers are not all the same. If we were, - face it - the population of teenagers would be much more organized, much more determined, and much more violent towards its greatest threat (three guesses who I am talking about and the last two don't count). Not all of us hide in the school bathroom rolling illegal drugs during the lunch period. Not all of us carry knives in our side pockets with a lonely person's name etched onto the blade. Not all of us fuck like rabbits and have children before age thirteen. No,  some  of us do have morals, believe it or not. In fact,  some  of us actually do value thinking and education over sex, drugs, and rock-'n-roll (or, in modern vernacular, fucking, stoning, and rapping).  Here's your handy translation guide for this (with respects to Alanna). Co-gender sleepovers are not for all-night copulation. When we look at an item in a store, we are not stealing it. Parties don't always have booze. As it is now, our only accepted way of self-expression seems to be rebellion, which isn't that widely appreciated. But what can we do when we are expected to be of a certain color skin and a certain religion with certain hobbies and ethics? Some adults want a certain sexual preference, damn! I don't care, I am white, I am Unitarian, I am straight but not narrow. New minority formation here - generalization is making discrimination.  Okay, rant ended. Cheers, chaps.
