Still got one more assignment to finish up by mid-week then I'm all done and can settle down for a short break over the Easter weekend.  Really wish I could have spent more time studying for my tests than working on the assignment most of the time. Looks like I won't be getting those A's like I did last year. Funny how back in poly my final year was the best year for me, and not in just grades. Oh well, whats done is done. Must focuson the exams next.  And thats all I got to say about that. I really got to stop talking about school and work so much. I mean I'm sure no one wants to read about that. Thats why I have always used "selective posting" and only post when I feel there is something to discuss and not the boring daily drudge. For thats what my life is like mostly, a boring daily drudge and thats never interesting to read about.     >    Ok. On to the good stuff.        urlLink Trillian (and Trillian Pro)         - For quite some time now the trend has been not to stick to just one IM but to have several open at one time. The point of them taking up too much CPU processing is a moot point now with high-end CPU processors at an all time low. Nevertheless I like having all my contacts in one place and not having to jump between program windows. In this case, I can't say enough how about how good Trillian in in this aspect. Only one contact list for all my contacts, a standardized message window, being able to write more than one line in MSN and no more ICQ ads and useless buttons from both. Recently upgraded to the pro version and I'm falling in love with it all over again.         urlLink okcupid.com         - Coming off like a more focused  urlLink friendster , the interesting thing about this site is the use of personality test and questions to further give depth to someone's profile. It can come off as a little cheezy and questions themselves can be a racy, but the underlining humor and personality profiling tricks (which I always had an interest in) makes it an interesting place to visit.           >    Well here are my own results from the above mentioned okcupid.com test. Big props to  LdyRne  for putting it up on own friendster bulletin.
