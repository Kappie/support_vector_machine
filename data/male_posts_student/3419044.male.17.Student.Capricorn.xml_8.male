I am kinda pissed off right now (Hence the title...).  Not entirely sure what it is, but it seems numerous events have just thrown me over the edge.  I was filling out my grad party form and wrote down 8 tickets (8 beer/coolers/rum/etc.) and my Mom says that's too much.  I was offended by her telling me what I can and can't do, so I slammed the pen down and came into here.  Turned up my angry music, A Static Lullaby, The Distillers, just anything loud, hard, with alot of bass.  It sure shows my emotion.  So yeah... parents... seem so damn aggravating at times... Well that is all for now... Can't wait for supper... 8-) (Rolling eyes emoticon...)
