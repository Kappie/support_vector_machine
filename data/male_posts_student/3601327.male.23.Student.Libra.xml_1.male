You have stated on the mothership that you think Bush lied to get America to go to war in Iraq, and I have heard that from others as well (the common meme of "Bush lied, people died!). I would like to hold a sort of court of opinion. Since I am of the opinion that Bush did not lie, I leave the opening salvo up to you. Please provide specific incidents where Bush has lied about the war in Iraq. I would like to treat this just like a court of law. Hearsay isn't proof, neither is opinion. I would like to see specific citations linking back to transcripts or quotes from reliable sources of things Bush has said, followed by other specific citations from reliable sources that show why what he said is a lie.   I will then try my best to find citations that show that, in fact, he did not lie. And I will hold myself to the same standards.   And like a court of law, you have to prove your case beyond reasonable doubt, as do I. If it becomes a matter of interpretation or conjecture, then it is a non-case.  If I am unable to refute any of your specific accusations, I will officially change my opinion and agree readily that Bush did in fact lie.  I am always saying that we need to listen to other opinions with an open mind, and now I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is.   The ball is in your court.
