Last Sunday went to Kuantan Airport to pick up my relatives who just came back from Mecca when I met my junior at school, Syamim who is now in form 5 in MRSM Jasin. Really happy to meet, although we have met last month. For your information, the Chelsea jersey I wear is bought with him for a special price. ;-)     Yesterday I had lunch with Raja Shamri and Abang Z at Benteng (riverside), Kuantan to discuss the new design of the website and web services to be implemented. Also discussed about what smartphone to buy and his bussines plans and experiences. The lunch is on Abang Raja, who else going to pay. Also met Aizat, my classmate who just came back from playing golf with his friends.  Today went to school to get last year school magazine. Liyana Yanti is also at school to pick up something else and we had quite a long chat to catch up what's going since November last year. Bummer, the magazine cover doesn't follow my design but oh well, it was nicely done and I already have my desgin used in the cover for 2002. Flipping thru the English sections it turns out most writing is done by my ex-3G cronies such Faezar, Safiyah and Nadiah.Then had lunch with Dad, Dr. Basri, and Mr. Nazri (PHIM's manager) before going to BSN to buy the UPU form.         Dedicated to the Loving Memory of Our Brothers Hafiz B. Ishak (1984-2002) and Zuhair (1987-2003)   A creative haer obsessed with satistaction, Was a drama in an unkind society, You have given them a star filled night, And you have given them a beautiful bouquet of sunflowers, But for you there's only contempt, Though you pourself into that flame and you present it so proudly, This world cannot accept you, So long starry nights, You gave to us and you took away from us, The one thing we never acknowledge, Your life...  Adapted by, Ahmad Waqiyuddin 5SH   My Memory   Dedicated to the Loving Memory of Our Friend Mohd Zuhair Syafiq bin Zulkifli (1987-2003).  There is no more you In this funny world There is no more you In thus tiny world You went to a place No one can imagine where One day you are smiling The next day you stopped walking You are now free But I am still here With thoughts of you And one day No one knows when I will be there with you  Syaza Zuhairah 4SB       Being a teenager and a student is the best and happiest moments of our life. So little responsbilities, so carefree...  But sadly, some of us are destined to return to God at this very stage of life. We can't be sure how long we will stay in this world so live our life to the fullest within the limits of our religion and strive for excellence in whatever we do. Don't waste any time loitering at shopping complexes and having too much entertainment because we don't know how much time are left for us.  I'll be starting my driving lesson practical this week and Insya-Allah I would learn to be a good driver. Zuhair's death is a bitter reminder to all of us in SMART to drive carefully and sensibly.   May Allah bless the souls of our brothers - Hafiz B. Ishak and Mohd Zuhair Syafiq bin Zulkifli. Amin Ya Rabbal Alamin.  - Sound of  Bring Me to Life  by  Evanasance  -
