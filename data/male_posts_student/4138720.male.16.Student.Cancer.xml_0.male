They were seperated by a very small, yet stable gap of time and space where reincarnation would take place. Then something happened. The universes crossed creating a dual reflection of life. Just before this occured however, a man died. His mind was floating around in this gap awaiting reincarnation when, because of the universal cross, it was split into two opposite yet alike reflections. The larger portion of this was reincarnated into myself. The later and smaller portion was stuck for about a 2 month time in the shifting wave lengths of the space-time continueum. It then was mixed with another, underdeveloped mind and reincarnated into David. So, me and david are partly the same person.       This theory was arived at by detailed study of our dreams and experiences. We have a phsycic link that lets us communicate certain things without words. Now as for our dreams, that is quite intriguing. Since there were 2 universes our former person could have lived in either one, but when the universes crossed his life patterns and mental stasis were warped into the cross. In our dreams, we each see portions of our past life and sometimes, we even relive them in this one. So technically, we can see the future. I, having the larger portion, see more, and experience more in this life. But David, having his portion mixed with another has higher mental state, being smarter, and quicker in thought processes. Who knows, maybe one day the universes will uncross and we will each split again. After many many years, we will have populated the entire Earth!!!
