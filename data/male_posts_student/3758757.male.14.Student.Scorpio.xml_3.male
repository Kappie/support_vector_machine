(except maybe complain to Google)   First things First: My names Trent Smith and im a 14 year old Male, from Adelaide, Australia.   I decided to create a blog in the hope of getting a Gmail account before my friends, (In case you don't know what Gmail is, it's a email account with 1gig of space and a better interface than hotmail) but I haven't seem to have gotten one..... yet.....   Till next time.....  Zero Percent aka Trent Smith
