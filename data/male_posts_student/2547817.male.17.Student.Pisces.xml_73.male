The only constancy in life is inconstancy. Just when I thought that I had things going my way, it hits me.  Why do I have to talk to God? Why can't he talk to me? Why were the people who I am close to get the third call for the scholarship and why wasn't I included. Why did I say what I said that day. Why am I questioning this even though I said thy will be done in my life? WHY DO I FEEL LIKE SCREAMING AND CRYING AND BREAKING AND TEARING NOW?  That's it. I'm broken. I'm beaten. Again, just when I was recovering from Zel, life is like a box of chocolates aint it. You never know what you gonna get.  I've failed myself again. Wake the fuck up Tim.
