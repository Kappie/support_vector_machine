As Michelle over at  urlLink  nervous   explains why she loves "Demotivators":     I love how Despair, Inc. really hits the nail on the head for a lot of people. Some of us are fed up with cute motivational posters hanging in the office...  Yep.   And thanks to Michelle for the reference for this wonderful site. If you have ever seen other sites that market "motivational materials" (Hallmark meets the human potential movement) then you'll understand how perfectly Despair, Inc. mimics them.
