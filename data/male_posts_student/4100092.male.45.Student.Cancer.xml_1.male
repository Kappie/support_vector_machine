Most people don't like skeptics, they are labeled doubters, or scoffers.  They are perceived as trouble makers so their social life is not always as active as those who express extreme optimism.  I normally take issue with the label. Even though I am a skeptic it does not mean I do not believe in anything, nor does it mean I am not optimistic.  I am committed to what ever it is that I am convinced of.  I don't believe everything I read, or everything I hear. I think about it for a season and if it checks out I am sold.  This skepticism has saved me from spending useless dollars on stain removers, fat reducers, and puffed up politicians.  I am skeptical that the world can change all that much in four years. I am skeptical that any one person can be elected to an office and really pull off all that they promise.  I am skeptical that people are basically good.  I am skeptical that all rebels are evil and I am skeptical that compliance to every rule makes me a better person.  My skepticism has allowed me to find my place in this world.  It has allowed me to ask the right questions. It is through these questions that I have been able to see through the veil of fog that surrounds most people who refuse to see the truth even if it is screaming at them.  I would like to be skeptical of less, I simply think that with every new day I will discover something else to be skeptical of.  The good news of this is that with every new day I will also be convinced of something as well.   Victor Manning
