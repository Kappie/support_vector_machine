Any unhappiness or any sadness in NPCC, you should write it down here okie. I hope to receive comments from each and everyone of you. You are also allow to write about me and also who knows you might want to thank me for all the trainings all this while. Hope to hear from everyone of you soon.   At the same time, for any subsequent event about the squad, I will post it up here okie. Good Luck and take care.  Amin
