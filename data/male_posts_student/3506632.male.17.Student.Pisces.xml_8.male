The human mind being the limited self-conceited jerk it is made as by default, these relationships are governed by either social and cultural norms, or by the real truth of life, "Spirituality". In turn this spirituality requires its own food. Generations have taken music to be the very food for the spirit, not realizing that music itself can not be defined, a heavy metallic song vis-a-vis folk music tells the whole story. The real food of spirituality is the set of beliefs one has regarding life, the seen and the unseen. This very set is known to contemporary man as religion. Whenever thinking where you stand in life go over all these points and decide what you have chosen for yourself to define life, is it really you own choice and do you have any better alternatives.
