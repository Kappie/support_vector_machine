Jesus said love one another that your joy may be full, and honour thy mother and father - do these commandments still apply when your early parents are cursing your heavenly father?    A man who hung on a tree for everyone is ridiculed and made fun of day in and day out in this, our "modern" society.  Jesus saves yesterday, today, and for forever - His love is everlasting.
