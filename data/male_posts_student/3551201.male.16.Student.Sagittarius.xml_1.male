Add to that the undoubtedly large number who are black (or other-hued) Christians, and you are forced to conclude that our volunteer military is composed almost exclusively of Christians.           Which doesn't exactly suprise me. What does suprise me is when the anti-Christian secularists who benefit most from such an arrangement fail to leave well enough alone. Like when Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin came under heavy media fire last fall for speaking publicly (in church) about the War on Terror in terms that cast it as a battle between God and Satan. Or last April, when the ACLU began maneuvering to ban the voluntary lunchtime prayer that has been a tradition at the Naval Academy since its founding.          You'd think even liberals would have the sense to realize that if a man is willing to put his life on the line to protect you from ruthless savages like Osama bin Laden, maybe it's not such a great idea to complain about why he's willing to take such a risk, or about the prayers he may say before, during or after. But then, assuming good sense on the part of liberals is never a safe bet.          So I was thinking, just as a little stunt: what if Christians threatened to boycott the armed forces until liberals ceased their anti-Christian carping? Don't you think, faced with no alternative but joing the military themselves, they'd shut up pretty quickly? Come to think of it, maybe Christians should up the ante and demand that unless and until liberals lay down their figurative armas in their "culture war" against Christiany, Christian soilders will lay down their literal arms in the real war against terrorism.          Like I say: Just as a little stunt, to shock the liberals back to their senses. And maybe even may them count their blessings.
