Perhaps crowded enough to convert a plant-like me into a strong diamond-like me texture. There was also a group of boys whom were so absolutely SMELLY...and I couldn't take it! Nearly choked  suffered from asphxia in the train due south to City Hall station. Nevertheless, I enjoyed myself at the Esplanade with my friends...quite an interesting day.  Hehe...we were nearly driven out of the 5566 concert since we left of our own accord. Now I understand why concerts should not have free admission; it'll cause a mob to form and big enough to form the  sans-culottes  of 1789. (Yes...the French again~! O_O La Diana est la Francaise!)  Enjoying myself on Friendster again...with that irritating smiley face which should be replaced with a sad face known as Foester instead. In this way, we can enjoy BITCHING better right? Imagine so many people bitching around by writing bitchy testimonials, which makes it similar to a virtual version of Mean Girls. SO BITCHY of me~~~=D [Hehe...I sound like some slut~~]  Friends is so funny....especially this episode where they learn French. I'm not amazed that Matt LeBlanc can be so expressive in French...he's a French-American, noting the 'Le' in his surname~~=) [He's quite hot too...! But I ain't gay!] Hmmm...why am I side-tracking...kinda' lame of me to write further good points about Friends.  Back to the main topic, the fireworks were kinda' great but too short. We need more to suit ourselves to the Live Firing Area comin' up in less than 2 years' time! But I loved those cauliflowers exploding across the maroon backdrop of the Singapore nightsky, with the city skyline in the background. Perfect picture to take photo! But oops! Did Singapore ever had an impressive skyline? The only skylines which I would deem to be beautiful would be that of New York's and Tokyo's which are so damn beautiful that you would say 'Wow!' and 'Sugoi ne!' in the Big Apple and at the centre of the Japanese Kanto plain respectively.  Okok....looks like I've been spitting too much saliva out in this site. Better remember Yoke-ling's request to lessen my saliva. And I'm kinda' impressed she really went for a makeover with her permed hair removed and contacts put on. Okok...enough of my rubbish...time to go...see ya!
