But anyway it's supposed to make people laugh and it is a kiddy show, so i should have lowered my expectations...haha...oh well.. its a good thing that i didnt pay for it huh ? its a good thing that i watched with my mum ! will be watching "Day After Tomorrow" again later this week....its really good....oh yeah,you guys have got to watch Harry Potter 3 coming on june 6( if you dont know!) and Mean Girls showing now... okay will write more when im free then.  Shrek 2 Movie rating: 55% pros: the animation was fantasic, great cast cons: shitty story plot, corny jokes, nonsense ending
