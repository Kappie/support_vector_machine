IF NO!!!  8 queens problem is - to place eight queens on a chess board i.e. on a 8x8 matrix in such a way that none of them clash each other.  (those who dont know how to play chess - queen can move in all the directions horizontal/vertical/diagonal)  So, now I am looking forward to a program written in any language - C++/Basic/VB/Pascal to provide all possible places on a chess board where 8 queen's can be placed.    Please do not submit downloaded program (from Web)! Only original entries will be entertained!!
