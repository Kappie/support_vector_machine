       
      Well, I go back to  urlLink college  once again and for the final time. I must say, I'm not a hard worker at all and that has given me and those around me quite a bit of grief in the last few years. I don't know what happened, but somewhere along the lines of highschool I realized that there's only so much I'd be able to learn in school. I guess I was right, because I can almost pinpoint the moments in which my brain just shut down and said, "Well, we had a good run; I'll see ya around buddy." I would just like to point out that this wasn't due to drugs nor alcohol. I'm sure some of you Psych majors are saying to yourself, "That's what happens... if you keep saying it to yourself, you'll start to believe it and it will come true." Well, it did, and I'm pretty much a failure at college. I'm prepared for the next stage in my life: a career. The worst part is, I am pretty sure that I will not be doing anything in my career with regards to my major (Electrical Engineering). I really don't enjoy it all that much and I'd much rather be fixing, upgrading and troubleshooting common computer problems all day for some Penetrode company out in Anytown, USA. Let's hope Cat becomes rich and famous with her artwork so I can be a stay-at-home dad.  I would be a kickass stay-at-home dad.   So anyway, where was I? Oh, nowhere. Well, OK then. This year will be my final year, regardless of me graduating or not (BUT I BETTER FUCKING GRADUATE). I'm taking some upper lever engineering courses, as well as some stuff I've taken before to try and up my GPA. I'm amazed the school still allows me to go there.  I love the Olympics. I really do. We've been watching 5.5 hours of it daily and it's still not enough. There's only about another week left, which is good because I don't want it to be on while school is in session.  urlLink NBC  is doing a fantastic job, methinks, and I've been doing a pretty good job avoiding  urlLink radio  and  urlLink Yahoo!  throughout the day so nothing gets ruined for me when I watch at night.  I gotta start packing shit up today and I'll be doing that the rest of the weekend. I'm gonna try and go see  urlLink Garden State  tonight with  urlLink Cat  and maybe some others (if I can get a hold of them).  I  love   key lime  and  lemon merengue  pie.
