And then, come back up here, and read this very, very different commercial parody sketch.  Which also may or may not be funny.  Would love feedback.  Thanks.  (Warning: ths may be horribly offensive.  I don't mean it to be.  Tell me if it is so I can delete it.  Thanks.)  [Lights up on 4 women in a living room.

It’s that time of the month—  WOMAN 2 —but you also need to mail your cable bill.  WOMAN 3 Or you go to the post office—  WOMAN 4 —and you get that feeling down there, like it’s that time of the month.  WOMAN 1 But now, there’s a product that solves this vexing age-old problem.  WOMAN 2 It’s government-issued legal tender postage—  WOMAN 3 —but it’s also a women’s sanitary product.  WOMAN 4 That’s right—  ALL 4 WOMEN Stampons!!  WOMAN 1 Ultra-absorbent—  WOMAN 2 —and completely valid for all first-class mail deliveries via the U.S. Postal Service.  WOMAN 3 Sticks on the envelope—  WOMAN 4 —but doesn’t stick in you.  WOMAN 1 And stampons come in a variety of sizes—  WOMAN 2 —and denominations.  WOMAN 3 Perfect for heavy flow days—  WOMAN 4 —or boxes up to 5 lbs.  WOMAN 1 Or just for precaution—  WOMAN 2 —Or for a postcard to a friend.  WOMAN 3 I used to tell my husband, all the time, that I wished there was one product that I could use to mail my letters, and to absorb my monthly flow.  And now, there is.  WOMAN 4 Just last week I was picking up the mail when I felt that all-too-familiar feeling.  So I just tore the cancelled stampon from my credit card application, and inserted it nice and snug where it belonged.  Problem solved!  WOMAN 1 And just last week I was on my way to the mailbox, when I realized I hadn’t put any postage on my electric bill – imagine if they turned off the lights!  I just reached down my pants, pulled out my stampon, placed it on the envelope, and dropped it in the slot.  Problem solved!  WOMAN 2 Stampons are flexible, to fit your body as you move.  WOMAN 3 And come in a variety of themes and designs, like the American flag, the Capitol Building—  WOMAN 4 —Or former President Dwight Eisenhower.  WOMAN 1 I like Ike.  WOMAN 2 I can’t wait for President Clinton to die.  He’d be perfect on a stampon!  WOMAN 3 He’s already autographed mine!  WOMEN 1, 2, and 4 Aww…!  WOMAN 4 Stampons have been proven just as effective as traditional women’s sanitary products—  WOMAN 4 But don’t take our word for it.  Pick up a box of stampons yourself.  Available at a drug store near you—  WOMAN 1 —or from your local post office.  NARRATORS From the makers of Jemorrhoids, the only jewelry that’s also an inflamed sore.
