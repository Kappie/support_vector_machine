I'll name all the classes by an emotion, just because I can.  Late: I was late to my Geometry class because I was feeling a little bit sick in the morning. I felt a bit better a while later and went into class. The teacher didn't even notice. Well, he did notice, but all he did was curtly nod his head at me as I strolled in. Everyone turned their head when they saw me. I think it might have shocked a few because I had my skateboard with me. I will get to that later.  Bored: English. Reading. Slowly. I like the book we are reading, but we are going to slow for me. I like reading things fast and getting it over with. Obviously this teacher does not. I also have a five paragraph essay due by Thursday. As most of you know, I like writing, so it may be easier. Wow, I am turning into my teacher, reading this like he would. Scary.  Excited: It is lunch time. Time to leave campus. I stopped by Home (that's what Lenny and I call the spot we eat at) and told Liam where I would be. I than proceeded to leave the campus and skateboard in the general direction of Granada. Which brings me to my 7th period.   YAY!: Yes, this is my reaction. Dominique and I met for lunch. It was so great! I now know that I am going to like B-Days (the first time I put that down, was in Trillian. For you non-Trillian users, disregard this. For you Trillian users put in B-D [in all caps]. It confused me for a second. If you don't know what Trillian is, disregard that). Mostly because I will probably get to see Dominique, even if we get to see each other later that day. So now I am going to bring my skateboard to school everyday except on A-Day Fridays. Mondays and Wednesdays I have to skate home 'cause my mom has school. Oh well, it's a small price to pay. The alternative is waiting until sometime past three for her to pick me up, which I would rather not do. Next semester I will probably have to skate everyday because my classes will change. More on that next semester.  Hyper, a little: Dominique gave me her drink from Subway, so I got some Mountain Dew. That's good because I have Biology 8th period (the period directly after 7, for you Granada folks). My teacher is very late. Like 5 minutes after the bell rings. So I am sitting there waiting for her for 20 minutes, when I could have been in the class; in the nice warm class. Not to bad though. Could be worse, it could be pouring rain with no place to go.   Home again, home again, safe and sound. Came home, and my mom had biscuits made! W00T. I love biscuits!  The link of the day today is to another one of my websites. Actually, its to my alternate Blog. I am writing a short story in my spare time (which is harldy any). I like the subject matter, but you guys might now. Check it out if you are bored.   Well, I have some fat fish to deep fry. See ya!  **EDIT** Well, I feel stupid. You know how my header (my feeling and link) is bigger than the rest of my text. Well, sometimes I forget to end the tag to make it big. So I get this whole post that is all the same size text. It's easy for you guys to read, but it takes up a lot of space. Better now. If you ever see something like that, just wait a little while, I will come to fix it.  **EDIT** PART 2 Well, I decided to make the link of the day open in a new window. Anytime you click on one you will get a pop-up. That way you won't ever have to leave my site. YAY!
