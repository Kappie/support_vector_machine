Oh well, hopefully I will be able to eventually. I spent most of the rest of the time listening to the radio. Right now I love The Killers' song "Somebody Told Me." I can't help but laugh during the chorus when he sings, "Somebody told me that you had a boyfriend, who looked like a girlfriend, that I had in February of last year..." It kind of reminds me of how messed up everyone's relationships seem to be these days. In that way it makes me sad. The people at the house across the street are really getting on my nerves. All night last night they were apparently trying to repair a car and a pickup truck which both had some serious muffler problems. I seriously considered going outside and yelling at them, but I was half-asleep and I wasn't about to get out of bed.
