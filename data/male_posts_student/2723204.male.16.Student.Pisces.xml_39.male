Applies to christianity too, i don't believe that "christianity is not a religion, but a relationship with God" kinda thing. Christianity is a relationship with God, but also, it IS a religion, no point trying to make it sound nice by doing away with the "r" word. Sure, Buddhism is a "state of mind", not a religion, go figure.......What is the nature of God again? Back to ontology here. God is analogous to the moon, the nature of god that is. The moon is never-changing in form and shape. The moon today is the same moon 6 million years ago. But however, its manifestations is ever changing. A crescent moon? A half-moon? A full-moon?  I guess I've mentioned this point in previous posts, but also another characteristic of the moon. The moon is 3-diemensional in nature. God's mind moves in vectors, with magnitude and direction, but the human mind moves in scalars, uni-directional, with only an understanding of magnitude. We, on the Earth can only see the moon in 2-diemensional proportions. The 2-diemensional human mind would never be able to comprehend and understand the 3-diemensional nature of God. This is the same for organized religion, the reason why there are so many religion is because of the worship of the different manifestations of the same God. (Judaism, Christianity and Islam can be a very good example).  There would never be a full-revelation of God. No religion will ever have a full-revelation of God. The most a religion can see is a full-moon, but it is still partial revelation of God. To claim that a religion possesses the full revelation of God and that it is 100% "correct" is pure arrogance. However, such a nature of the human mind, its 2-diemensional nature has not gone unnoticed by God. God works and reveals himself in the context of our 2-diemensional mind. But with all humility, we have to accept our religions as being 2-diemensional in nature, and not yet possessing the full, 3-diemensional revelation of God. Even if we do, I doubt if the human mind has the ability to comprehend it.  Done with my opinion on religion, more of a philosophical perspective rather than sociological one.
