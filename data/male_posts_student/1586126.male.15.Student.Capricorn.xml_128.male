I would give my life to be there... when everything was simple, i didnt really want anything, and my parents either couldnt afford what i wanted, or they just didnt want me to have it. and i was ok with that. and so i didnt really have a lot of toys, just loads of books, and my room was dark and small, and you could only walk a bit around my bed. my room had this large window that led to the room where my mom washed the clothes, so she made the landry at night and i remember that i couldnt sleep well because of the noise.   I also remember one time in my old house when i was like... 5 or 6 that i was sleeping, and an earthquake started, and i was scared so i got out of bed, and it was so dark that i confused the closet to my room door because they were next to each other and i went inside and bumped against all the clothes hanging and realized where i was and it stopped trembling. then i went to sleep with my parents. ^^  thats about all i remember. oh in 4th or 3rd grade, i remember that i had gotten sick (well manuel actuall told me this) (but i remember getting sick and him calling me) and so i didnt go to school that day and manuel called my house to see if i was like, ok and i told them that i was fine and bla bla bla and then the call ended and the day went on. like, 4 months ago, manuel told me about that day, and he says that in the morning an earthquake started and he says that he remembers the big book shelf i had next to my bed and that he thought the tremor had made it fall on top of me, and since i wasnt in school, he thought that i had died or something. so he called me and asked if i was ok. it makes sense now hunh? the moment when he called me started to make sense the day manuel told me about it.  -------------------------- Minor Threat - Salad Days --------------------------  wishing for the days when i would wanna shoot baby has grown older its no longer cute man, too many vvoices theyve made me mute baby has grown ugly its no longer cute  but i stay on i stay on where do i get off? on to greener pastures the core is getting soft look at us today weve got something back waiting for our moments theyre just not coming back man im serious,  about the stuff we lack dwell upon our memories but there are no facts on i stay on where do i get off on to greener pastures the core is getting soft ( do you remember the time, i dont know, it fact it was about 3 years ago  [bla bla bla] ) wishing for the days when i would wanna shoot baby has grown older its no longer cute man, too many vvoices theyve made me mute baby has grown ugly its no longer cute  but i stay on i stay on where do i get off? on to greener pastures the core is getting soft (do you remember when... yeah so do i.. we called those the salad days and do you remember when... yeah so do i we called those the good old days whatever,  i call it A LIE  ========================
