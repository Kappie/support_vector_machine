Daddy, daddy, What have we seen here, There's so much that we don't understand, So I took them in my arms, And we turned and faced the cross, Then I said dear children watch the lamb.  Guys, lent is here. You know what that means. "Watch the Lamb" can be played as often as you would like and no one can say anything about it. Theresa, play it loud and proud for those who don't know what it is. How can you not know about "Watch the Lamb" What a disagrace. Also, why are some people total dumbasses. Just about every author of the reviews of "The Passion of the Christ" I have read totally missed the point of the movie. It was to tell the story of Jesus' death, brutality and all. What do you think happened on the last day. He sat and has tea with the soldiers? I don't think so. The stupid lady in our paper wanted to see more of his gosple message and miracles. I didn't know Jesus was perfroming miracles on his way to be crucified. I'm gonna go see it and yes it will probably be pretty graphic. But thats what I'm expecting. I bet it was alot worse witnessing it in person. Either see it and appreciate it for the story it is telling us or don't go see it. There is no way to lessen the brutatlity shown to Jesus and try to tell the true story. Atleast thats what i think.   Watch the lamb...and listen to the song...and don't eat meat. Damn rules.
