I met my current gang of friends back in year 10, only meeting them when I started walking to dinner with them. I met Andy, Andy, Danny, Billy, Sam and the rest of the crew... some I already knew, others were totally new people to me. I came in to the group as an outsider but I was accepted and within weeks became part of one of the best friendship groups to be formed in our school. I never used to be the most social person in the world but my friends brought that side out of me and because of them I am who I am today. Over the last 3 years I've changed a lot, and I think I owe the change to them. I don't believe I've met greater, more unique, people than the ones I hang around with today. I look forward to the parties we have, the trips to the cinema and bowling. I just wish that over the six week holidays I could see them more, they mean everything to me. Not a single day goes by when I don't think of them... I've been through a lot of different friends during my school life and even though I'm always with my friendship group I have branched off, but for some reason it's never the same and I start going back to who I was before, someone I don't want to be. Some people make me upset, paranoid, but my friendship group don't, not anymore anyway. I know I can trust them... and always will be able to.          James
