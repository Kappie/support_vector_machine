Embellishing the truth, on the other hand, is different. Most things are so boring, and need to be spiced up in order to be interesting.  Well, my Gatsby essay, after being taken apart by three people, is back in order. After a few runs through John's Alchemy Machine, I have turned crap into gold. Now, I am pretty sure I have my A in english locked down. In Spanish, I have an A. In Chemistry I have an A. In FST I amazingly busted out an A and Orchestra I have an A too. In my AP classes I have a B and a C. Now, with a little luck I will be able to pull some fours on those tests. That will be good.   Mattson, we should film that "Why White People Are Different From Black People" sometime. That would be funny as long as we got to play the roles of racist rednecks. In other movie news, Bubba Ho-tep comes out soon. Although I haven't seen it yet, it looks horrible in a good way. A way that may be hilarious, and even if it isn't, it will still be so dumb it will be hilarious.   Yeah, this weekend I have the kickball tournament Saturday morning and then Joe Day's concert Saturday night. That's about it.
