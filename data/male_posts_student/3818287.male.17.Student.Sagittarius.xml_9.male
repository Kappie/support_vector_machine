Well, just to let you know what to expect, I'll give you some music happenings (just to let you know, i write for Acclaimedpunk.com), how I'm feeling each day, and also the Chris Words of Wisdom (patent pending!). Well, talk to you soon, and feel free to leave you're questions, comments, and love letters!
