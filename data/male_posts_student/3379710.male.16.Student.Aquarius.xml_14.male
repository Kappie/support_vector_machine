Eg. Warrior loses to Mage. Mage loses to Archer. Ect.  With multiple types of battle, you may be 'impure'. This means being two or three different types. You will still have the weakness of your highest skill, but you will infilct all weaknesses, depending on the weapon you currently weild.   I suggest that you keep all three weapon types: Staff, bow/crossbow/thowing knives/throwing axes, and sword/mace/battle hammer/ax. This way, you will have the apropriate tool to train ANY battle skill at ANY time.
