That was my first summer there and that's when I met Brittany and Danny Good and many other freinds that would last me through many years. I went on the feild trips and I had lot of fun!  There were all-time favorite Counselors at owe that year and the three summers after. There was Jen, she was funny girl! She was serious alot though! We had Jay, Jay was real cool. He had bleached hair, he was kinda the original Coach at O2b. There was Nick. Nick was a tall dude, he was also Brittany Filers first crush. Oh lord! Constant "Nick Nick Nick!" thats all I heard from Brittany for three summers!I didn't get mad at him though. It wasn't his fault! It drove me crazy, but it was nothing to what I was about to hear in the years to come.    One time we were at O2b and me, Danny Good, and Kim dared Brittany to go over to Nick and kiss him on the lips. She did so without question. The only problem was that Danny didn't see it so she had to do it again. Now that I remember properly...It was disgusting. I'm still happy that there was no tounge involved.  One day our science teacher, Mrs. Julie, was absent. So some nice little pathetic 18 year old who was just working there for some extra money let us come in and mess with the computers. " Don't go on anything dirty!" He told us. His name was Phil. And he had no idea that that little summer job would go on for 4 years.   4TH GRADE!   My parents took me out of the private school and put me back into public school in the middle of 4th grade. I went to Talbot Elementary. My first couple days at Talbot left a huge impact on the rest of my social life. Most of it started with the food fight. I only remember the very begining of the food fight, it's a little blurry. Me, Jeb, Jared Campbell, Zachary Adams and some other dude where all eating lunch. Jeb accidently flicked some cheese onto Jared's sandwhich, Jared flicked it onto Zacks tray, Zack got all pissed off and smudged his mashed potatoes into jareds face. Jared shot up and grabbed his milk and poured it all over Zach and Jeb...there I was, sitting beside jeb, who was covered in milk, I was confused as hell. Jeb grabbed a handfull of cheese and launched it at Jared. He tried to duck but it got all in his hair. The other dude popped up out of nowhere and smaeared his pizza sauce all over Zacks shirt. Then, the lunch lady stopped the fight somehow and pulled us all into the assistant pricipals office...Miss. Redd...She talked to us one at a time. I simply named everyone who was involved...big mistake...The next day: Jared, Jeb, Zack and the other dude were suspended for two days. I was the most hated person in 4th grade. Girls were actually crying and asking me why i ratted them out! I had no idea that this would ruin my entire school social life all the way up to 7th grade!!!  Well I did get one freind in Talbot that year. He came in after the incident so he didn't care. His name was Ryan Hewitt! Me and Ryan would always go out during recess and pretend we where defending earth against the aliens! It was really fun! I was shooting my pretend little gun ito the air and bringing down the UFO's, while Ryan was running around the playground pretending that aliens were chasing him, shooting his pretend gun as he ran. "bam bam bam" he said whenever he shot his gun. I said it too Ryan! Don't feel bad!   O2B KIDS!!!!!!  Meanwhile, at O2b Kids, me and Danny Good were usually harrassing attractive young girls and constatly hitting on every girl we saw.  ...We were pathetic children... Our first victim was Karlee Melleville. he he he...Oh my God, Danny had the hugest crushes on her and Ashlee New. I wasn't crazy about them. I thought they were very very pretty but i didn't have a crush on them.   Well anyway, one of Dannys little plots was to get trapped in a closet with Karlee. I helped him! We lured her into the custodian closet somehow and Danny stepped in with her. I slammed the door shut and pushed the custondian cart over the door so Karlee couldn't get out, just like we planned. I stood in front of the cart to keep watch. Well Danny was a good actor! But the second he laid a hand on Karlee's shoulder, she swung her entire body against the door. The door flew open, I was tossed into the wall as the cart sped away and Karlee stormed off, " little perverts..." she said under her breath as she walked away. You can ask many many people, and they all will tell you that Danny Good was the most perverted boy on the face of the earth. I just helped him acheive that title!  Karlee was the same age as me but she was much much bigger than me. She took this to her advantage whenever we were at the pool. She could easily shove my entire body under the water with one hand. " Hi Karl!" She'd say as she'd swim up to me...  "Bye Karl" she'd say as she dunked my head under water.  5TH GRADE!  When 4th grade ended, I emmediatly signed up for summer camp. I went into Danny Z's group of course. Every friday we went on a big feildtrip. We went to Wild Waters or Islands Of Adventure or Universal Studios or something like that. Danny begged me to go on the big Roller Coasters but I always wimped out. I always got scared when i saw the giant loops and huge drops. I went on the water flume rides everytime though. Tidal Wave...the big water ride at Bush Gardens is awesome! The wave that the ride makes is huge! The only part i hated about the ride was that my stomach always dropped when we went down the very very steep slope. It happens to everyone but I have always hated it!  Once we where on this train ride in Bush Gardens, I heard this girl talking to this pretty blonde girl sitting next to her about me. The blonde girl looked strangely firmiliar to me. the girl was goin on about how funny i was and how crazy i acted and then she said "Karl." I noticed that the blonde girls blue eyes flashed opened. "Karl? Karl Auffenberb?" she asked her freind. "Well, it's Auffenberg!"  " Oh my gosh! I knew him in preschool!" She said. Then i realized why the girl looked so firmiliar...It was Rebecca! We talked and talked on that little ride. We never mentioned our little puppy love though. Well that summer was the last time i ever saw her.   One time we all went to Universal Studios and Brittany Filer was in my group that day. When we went on Hannah-Barbaras Cartoon ride thing. Me and her were embarrassing O2b Kids by screaming our brains out at the screen! It was so funny! We did the same thing on King Kong and Back To The Future.   I met another girl that summer. Her name was Torry. She was a really nice girl. It turned out that Mr. good had a crush on her. Once again he tried his old tactic. I assisted in this one as well. But we didn't use the closet this time...no...We used the elevator. We stole a snack cart from the cafeteria and Danny asked Torry to help him push it into the elevator so they could get it outside. Well once that elevator door closed, Danny mashed the emergency stop button. I dont know what happened after that...I just remember getting called into Danny Stevens office. Danny Stevens is the strict manager of o2b. Me and Danny spent a couple of days home after that little incident. We were lucky that he didn't get rid of us for good.    Well Torry hated me for about two weeks and hated Danny for about a month. The next thing I hear...Danny comes running up to me me and said him and torry two kissed eachother in the obstacle course. This was hilarious! I spread it all around O2b. Then Torry hated me for another two weeks, and Danny for another 3, since he told me.     Danny Zwillings left for Orlando in the middle of the summer. I was relocated into Chads group. Chad was the coach at the time.   One of my favorite classes that summer was Computer Class. A Mr. Phil Nick tought it. This was the same little pathetic 18 year old! He was now 19 though...Phil was awesome! He was so lovable! Like a hobbit! HE looked exactly like a hobbit! I enjoyed Phils class so much, that when summer ended and the after school program kicked off, I asked to be put into Phils group. even whn Danny returned later that year I still stayed in Phils group.   Brittany Filer gained her first nickname that summer. She was eating with Phil during snacktime and she put a cup up too her mouth and made strange noises and sounds. Phil Nick! God bless him! He told her she sounded like a dying cow! Brit wore a sign that day with the words " DeadKow" on it. And from that day on...she was known as DeadKow!     During that summer, there was a boy who always was playing video games that he downloaded off the internet...This boy started an entire trend at the O2b Computer Lab. He is an O2b Computer Lab Legend...Just below Phil...and just above me...He gave us the Emulators...Emulators are video games from old game systems like Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo, that you could download onto your computer and play. It was a huge success! Everyone was playing old Sega games like Sonic and NBA Jam. Phil didn't really care...As long as the kids were happy. The boys name was Freddy Lambes...I had no clue that he was the boy I met years before.   Every thirty minutes Phil is required to go into the computer lab and shout out "Switch!" This means that you had to get off and let the kid behind you play.   That was also the second summer of the CIT (Counselor In Training) experiment.The CIT program is where teenagers (13-16) can experience what it is like to be a counselor...Some of the best CIT's that I can remember were Becky, Greg, Arthur, Slim Shady, and Megan Conlon. They where all hilarious. CIT's all  wore rediculously ugly green shirts.       I also met Troy that summer. Troy was a short funny little man who always brought the two kids he babysat to O2b with him. He was hilarious! He was a good freind of Phil and taught alot of Phils prgogramming classes when he was absent. Troy was the kind of guy you never forget. He helped me write my first HTML website entirely out of code. I wrote it simply with Notepad. It was about something rediculous... "I took the chicken out of the oven and it smelled like poop."  I wrote that and posted it on the internet when i was 10 years old It had some other stuff on it too. A picture or two and some qoutes from Richard Nixon that Troy added in. It was alot of fun. From then on then...Phil enjoyed the webpages I made.  TALBOT  5th grade!  MY 5th grade teacher was Mr.Kirby...I swear to god that the man is gay! Every week he had his "freind" come over and help him teach. They're roommates! His "freind" had blonde highlights and were hawaian shirts all the time. When it was Mr. Kirbys birthday, a freind of mine who shall remain nameless gave Mr. Kirby a Manicure Set! We all cracked up! Mr. Kirby had no clue who it was. He was a mean kid...  Every day, after school, the van from O2b stopped by talbot and picked us up. I had many many freinds in that van. There was little Manny, a little hispanic boy who had some attitude on him, he was in 3rd grade and he listened to the unedited version of The Thong Song. I met Jeffery Cromer, he was a spunky little red headed kid in the 3rd grade that i got along with very well. And then there were the Giles Twins...Brett and Blake Giles were in 4th grade...each of them were going out with a girl i knew in 5th...Thats how "cute and adorable" they thought they were. They were both really cool though. One time we all got into this big wrestling match in the van...Well one of Brett or Blakes fingers went up my nose and scratched the inside of it. When he pulled the finger out it was all bloody and nasty! It's a nasty story! Let me just say that Freddy didn't want to play video games with me when he saw my bloody nostril. Ya...I told you it was nasty...  I remember one time in 5th grade, Jeb asked our music teacher what weed was...If you knew jeb...you can tell that this wasn't his last time he'd hear about the word. He was such an idiot! He told our Music teacher, as well as the entire class that he put a weed, from his lawn, in his mouth and set it on fire!  O2B!  That year, at o2b I met Tyler! Tyler was really cool! He was Freddy's best freind and the co-founder of the Waddle-Dees! The Waddle-Dees was a club that freddy and Tyler started that revolved around Waddle-Dee and Kirby.  ...We were extremely bored children... Everyday, after we got back from Snack Time, me and and other Waddle-Dees would go into the computer lab and hold a "Waddle-dee" conference! I have no clue what we talked about. I honestly dont remember! It was nonsense though...I know that! Freddy was funny!   I remember when we went out to the Gazebo everyday for snack time on the lake. there were catfish in the lake...the grass in the feild had netting in it and we always ripped it out and concocted our very own fishing line. We used safety pins for hooks and crackers as bait...those catfish would eat anything! Well, we pulled a few fish out of that water...but a counselor always had to unhook the poor catfish. They were amazed that a couple of 10  year olds could put all that together.       Well Danny came back that year! But Jay left! Jen left!  We had many coaches after Jay but it will never be the same... We had Cliff, Graham, Sean, Keith, Cristian. They were all great, but on one can fill the void that was lost...  Anyway... when 5th grade ended I could only go to 02b for about a month because my family and I were going to go on vacation in Indonesia. when I returned to O2b it was like the last week before school started. I returned with gifts! I gave Phil a wooden monkey that i bought in a market. And I gave Danny a wooden Komodo Dragon that I bought from some carpenters on Komodo! I gave Brittany and Arthur (the CIT) little wooden Garudas (hindu god). They loved them! I returned with many pictures and many stories. The night I got back I called Phil! His little sister was having her birthday!  Sadly though...the first week I came back to o2b...was the last time I saw alot of people...  I never saw Nick Deice again...Deadkows first love! She said she sees him every now and then. I never saw Becky (CIT) I never saw the Harker brothers again either, they were some good freinds i had. Or Beckys little brother. Or the Giles Twins. Or Manny!  You see, I didn't go to O2b during 6th grade at all! I got so fat that I thought it would be embarrassing to go back. the first time i went back was in the middle of the summer after 6th grade.
