But remember, just because someone does something bad once, it doesn't mean that you can't ever trust them again - I don't know the whole story but they may have just made a mistake...  Think long and hard about where you want your friendship to go with these people before you do anything silly. :P  *hands you a bucket of love* wuv yoo
