But since I already split from my former maths group I had to do it all alone and likewise present it myself too. Anyway, I think I did pretty well, though she did comment that I kept looking at my script. Who cares anyway? I got an intra-class debate tomorrow! Aagh... So stressed out sia. And what's more, I think I have a sore throat, so how to debate? Besides, my debate script is so damned short - I don't think I can present enough to impress Mr Tan (English Literature teacher - or Tit, as we call him), or fill up the 4 minutes of my speaking time. Hopefully the opposition team isn't competent enough and we would be able to manage a victory... But till then I'm going to keep worrying my head off. I had someexposureto debates last week when I was the reserve speaker for two inter-house debates.During our brainstorming sessions, it seemed that they could think up points I would never have even havecontemplated. I also picked up a few things that could be useful here, but... Oh well. Better to sleep now!
