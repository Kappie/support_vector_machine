I don't know why I suddenly mention her! :P to Wendy) Her format was almost smiliar to this thingy. For me, I needa get used to it.  Okie. Yesterday was Monday. Got new things? I did NAFA. Cheh. Disappointing in the sit-and-reach section. Oh well. The rest I hardly care.   During GP, that disgusting idiot (who else? MCP Meng Hau la) accused me of copying his group's answer for the Vocab Quiz. Oh please lor. Like they spelt correctly. I didn't even told Ben (the one writing the answer) anything, and we got it right somemore. Shoosh. They also know how to spell "coup de grace" (coo-de-gras)! They must have heard it while I was telling Ben the spelling! Fang si! Our group are the only groups that got it right, and they were sitting in front of us! Idiots! How dare they copy! Accusing me of copying somemore! Hypocrite!  Okay. During Choir, we recieved the news officially that Mr Liew is not gonna be our conductor anymore. Yeah. We were approached by Jeryl this morning, but we didn't sign anything. Yeah. Basically it is due to differences that built up over time. They even invited Mr Quek and Mr Tay to come explain. Mr Quek was funny..and so long-winded! I wanna watch my Survivor la! Yeah... After that, Jeryl and his friend wanted to quit choir, citing wanting to join Sports (train up for NS...ergh). Obviously, they are escaping. Lame reason if you ask me. Yeah.   Okay. Amber won Survivor! YaY! She was in the Final 2 with Rob. Rob even proposed on the revealing of results itself. Yeah. Ayiah..no matter the outcome, both of them will get the 1 million lor. Cheh. Heh heh! Amber even gave a car to Shii Ann! YaY! I am happy with the results, but I wished some other cats would be in the Final 2 instead. Like Kathy, Rupert, or even Shii Ann. Yeah.  Okie. Today. During GP, that MH irritated us again. We discussed on university entry and the class feels that JC students should get into U auto (unrealistic dreams...but ahh well...we can dream right). Yeah, tat idiot even butt in and said that poly students should not go to the university. WHAT THE FUCK! I got lotsa friends there lor! Are you saying every one of my friends is not good enough for Uni? So what if you got into JC? Does it gives you the authority to lord that pathetic fact over others? Please la...you are even a repeat student. My friends can do thousands time better than you, idiot! I didn't actually hear that statement (I heard it from CQ), I was too busy elsewhere, but there were cries of "That's unfair" in CQ's group (they all are anti-MH...I wanna join them!). He even made some stupid statement later, and Diana said loudly "You are narrow-minded" Wow! Coolies! I have been wanting to tell him that face to face! I admire her man! Next time, I should do that! Go on, you idiot MCP. Open your big mouth, sprout some nonsense, and I will make sure you will regret the moment you talked! Make my day!  Ergh. Qi xiao, qi xiao. There are better things to write than that idiot. Okay. One very very good piece of news. I GOT THE LETTER FROM RSS! Did I tell you anything? I dunnoe. I don't think so. Basically right, a few weeks ago, my friends received an invitation from RSS to go to RSS Award Ceremony to receieve some prize. I didn't get any...so I lost hope about 2-3 days of waiting. Yeah. I thought they were rewarding those who top their respective subjects in the Prelims. Well, apprently, they are also rewarding the 5As cats! YaY!! I was so happy when Father told me I got a letter from Riverside! YaY! I called almost everyone. CQ and WQ were indifferent (hmp!) and Siva, Joyce, Hann and Gloria were glad for moi! YaY! I get to skip Maths Lecture test too! HaHa! Tomorrow must ask CK if he got or not. He should get it one de la. So should Ping. We got 5As. If I got, why shouldn't they? Yep! :D I am so darn happy!   Yay! Okay, stop it KY. Yeah. I gotta go now. See ya next time! Night blog! TaTa!  EDIT: Ahh! I changed my layout and everything! There's this little function called "Comments".
