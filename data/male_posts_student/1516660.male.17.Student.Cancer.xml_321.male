Well, I always look at the kitchen clock when going in and out of the bathroom. Heh. After bathing, I came online for awhile, then went to eat chee cheong fun. After eating breakfast, I went out to take the 911 bus to the basketball court.  I met CQ there, then followed by KS. After a while, WQ came down. Hmm. YC and her cousin came, then Gloria and HL. As the court was full, we decided to go to the 350+ court to play. Hmm. I was reading my book when walking. Gloria and YC was terribly naggy. Hello lor! I have mastered the art of reading while walking. I have not and will not meet any accidents. Okay. Enough bitching. We reached the court after a long walk and me being safe and sound.   Hmm. We meowed at the game lor. Joyce and PY came and we meowed some more. What am I supposed to say about the game? After playing for some time, we are dead tired. Yeah. Oh well. At 1, YC and her cousin went back. We went to Causeway Point. Walk there lor, what else? Me and CQ talked some more lor. Yes. Meowingly meow meowed us. We walked all the way to Causeway Point.   Hmm. We went to McDonalds to eat lunch. Hmm. During some point, they suggested going to my house to watch VCDs. Ayioh...I don't want so many cats coming. No space!! Gloria got terribly annoying by repeating and repeating "Go your house leh!". I almost lost my appetite for lunch. Okay. I shouldn't be so evil. I am just terribly annoyed, that's all.   After that, we went to play pool. Joyce didn't bring her EZ-Link Card, so she has to go home and take. We met TZ there too. We decided to play two 9-ft tables. Hmmm. We played. I teamed with WQ for most of the time. Even though we didn't win everytime, we still won some games. Hmm. WQ is terribly jue. Yes. Oh well. Hmmm. We played for a long time. Sigh. In the end, each table have to pay $20, amounting to $5 each cat. Sigh. I have no moolah. That WQ, even though he has a lot of money, wouldn't help me pay first. He said "I need to buy the FM Tuner". Ohh...... So the FM Tuner is more important than me la. Okay. Next time, I won't ask him for financial help le. Obviously, gadgets are much more sought-after and valuable than friends. Sigh. I think I am terribly selfish. I need to think in his stance. He really need that FM Tuner and I can't go running to him for help everytime! In the end, TZ said I don't have to pay. Nonsense! I will pay him back (or at least, via KS) tomorrow. Yeah. Meow moo.  After that, we went home lor. 964 bus came first, so I left without Gloria. Hmm. I reached home, bathed and went online. Yeah. I ate my dinner while chatting with CQ. Hmmm. Sigh. I am at a mess, frankly speaking. Even ducks finished dinner at 7.  Hmmm. Right now I am chatting with XC and WQ, who are not really online. Later I am watching AI and waiting for Wendy to come online. Yeah.   So, I gotta get going. See ya tomorrow. Night blog!
