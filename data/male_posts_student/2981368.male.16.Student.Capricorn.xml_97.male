Break...the big smokebomb thing was a complete cock-up. Didn't work. All it did was made us look stupid. Ohwell, better luck tomorrow?  French...did nothing. Literally this time.  Lunch...got a large number of funny pics/videos. Including: - People breaking the fence - People throwing sticks at each other - People throwing banana skins at each other - Lucy getting in a piss with Rob - More stuff like the above  Science...sort of made that crunchy stuff. Bishop COMPLETELY wrecked ours, which turned shite-brown and went all over the desk. He then ate some of it. *urrrrgh* Got even more funny pics/videos. Like stuff burning, Bishop going completely insane, and Jack/Nat wearing foil cup thingos on their faces. Man, they looked so funny.   History...we got exam tips from Mr Bean. And generally did nothing else.  So an all round amazingly funny day. Tomorrow will, of course, be even better. Yay! And then...wow. No more school for 11 weeks. Or something like that. WOOHOO!
