Haiz..I think she already likes someone else.. not that sure about it.. but quite certain.. see her actions lor.. can tell.. my gf was also like that last time..maybe take one step at a time and see how it goes..Hope that one day she can give me a chance..I'll surely take very good care of her :)  Quote of the day:  Love without return is just like a question without an answer.
