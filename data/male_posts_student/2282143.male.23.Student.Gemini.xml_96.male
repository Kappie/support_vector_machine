There was food for 100 and only about 65 showed up, so needless to say we were fed (very well might I add!).  Manuel (aka Bob, yes he calls himself Bob) from Africa took care of us Europeans (as he says it, You-ROW-pee-ans).  Good guy, that Bob.  Saw the wolves too from a distance.  Still havent gotten to go into the exhibit yet because they are dumb and the employee preview was from 3 until 5:30 when I was working.  DUH.  So yeah, oh well.  Tonight was cool too.  Lark bailed cause of a wedding she had to go to, so I took Tony and scrounged up an extra ticket for Jeff.  Was good times.  Hung out, had too many hot dogs, and drank beer from Peru.  And that brings me here.  Im hot, tired, stuffed, and have to work at 7:30 tomorrow morning.  I think I may shower, relax, and call it an early night.  Que Bueno.  Roca.
