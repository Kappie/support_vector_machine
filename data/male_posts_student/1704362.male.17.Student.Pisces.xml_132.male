       
      I prefer not to live a deluded existence. While the thought may make you feel better, there is no life after death, nor immortal soul. The only real trace that you will leave after you die is a rotting corpse. Oh, and don't give me any of that "Immortal works" crap. If anyone who reads this thinks they're going to leave an indelible mark on society by writing timeless literature or becoming President, let me know so I can laugh in your face.  Don't be depressed. Be liberated.      info.link:  urlLink http://sky.prohosting.com/gssq/scepticism/literalism.htm   [Listening to: I Will Survive -  urlLink Gloria Gaynor  (03:17)]
