He is on like from 9-11am so I can't listen to him because of the social, life sucking vortex known as college, prevents me from actually doing the things I enjoy.    Twirling.....my mind wanders to things of the past and of things that will come to be. If I get into the right frame of mind, I can visualize my future. I am pretty acurate when it comes to my own future. I am not too shabby.
