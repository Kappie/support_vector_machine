I realize, even as I write this, that each of my posts really can't start out with why I haven't posted in so long.  So lets get right down to it.  Last week was busy because school is that way, and because I left town on secret mission number 2 to Chicago.  What a wonderful land.  I use the term "secret mission" because I am not  allowed  to do things like travel, have my own life, breath, etc when it comes to my overbearing mother who would flip a lid if she knew I was doing anything on my own.  Sometimes it's better to just not say anything, rather than deal with the burden of countless unnecessary explanations and round-trip guilt trips.  That is an entirely different story all together, and would not only bore you, but make you feel bad for me and I have enough self pity to not need any of yours, thanks.  Basically I'm treated like my shoe size (9) and not my age (23).  PS, my dick isn't tiny just because my feet are, it's a wives tale.  I'll show you sometime, just remind me.  It's nice, it's normal, you'll be happy and so will I.  Indeed, I'm cynical, and mostly joking though.  I couldn't love the woman more, and she couldn't annoy me even more than that, all at the same, manipulative twisted time.  Long story made longer- I went to Chicago with a good friend because, well because Chicago was there, we both love it, and the price was right.  "Right" in this story will mean dirt cheap.  The time was great, and yet again the city begged me to stay.  In September when I was there, visiting a law school, I fell in love with the city as an adult.  Before, I had always been a child when I was in Chicago, but it was in September when I visited that I realized I needed to be there.  I knew I had to put that city back on my map as a goal to reach as far as a living location goes.  This time, however, I was emotionally distraught to leave.  I knew that if I did not get into said law school that I visited in September, that none of THIS would be mine.  None of the people, none of the scenery, none of the intoxicating dynamic that is my dream location.  Illinois can suck my ass, by the way, I think that state sucks, but Chicago... rock on.  If I have to live in Illinois to have Chicago, I will live there with "Land of Lincoln" written ALL OVER my license plate.  So anyway, tag-team-back-again, I'm partying on party people here in Oklahoma and very sad to have returned from a land of wonderful food, people, shopping, and feelings of ecstasy.  The good news is, I'm settling back in to my life and looking forward to the future.  There will be plenty of things I will miss when I leave here.  I check my mail daily though, borderline diarrhea the whole time, hoping that I have a letter from the law school allowing me to enter their world of hell in a city of bliss.    Well to top it off, I come home to a tooth breaking in the back of my mouth and a 2 hour dental appointment this morning in order to fix it, along with other problems in my ever-complicated mouth.  lauren and I had a quick lunch together today, which really brought some joy to my depressed state right now.  Made me forget all about my half-numbed, painful mouth and about how I left my heart somewhere on Michigan Avenue outside of the 4 story Crate  barrel.  We had a great chat about everything from the condom-looking things on the legs of the chairs at Panera, to dry humping a pastors daughter.  Pregnancy came into play, as she usually does, and reared her dirty lil' head into our conversation.  Running around us, pregnancy laughed, and we talked about how much we hated her.  I'm just glad I'll never have to physically birth anything.  I barely like taking a shit.  I did confess to lauren, however, that if I DID have a child of my own that I would of COURSE love it and cherish it for all its glory.  Lauren simply looked at me with a disgusted look and replied "eh, if I had an ulcer I would take care of it" as if to imply that the child would be cared for, so as only to avoid the pain of jail time.    After a long winded, laugh filled conversation we parted and I join you now in the world of blog.  I'm going to take some Advil in order to relieve the throbbing in my mouth, and enjoy this thunderstorm from the comfort of my couch.  Ta-ta fair friend.
