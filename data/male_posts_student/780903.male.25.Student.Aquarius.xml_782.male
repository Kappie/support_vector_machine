Here, we learned how to use the Internet.  And what gets italicized in a footnote and what gets written in small-caps.  And how many lines we're allowed to put on a page in a legal brief, and what color the cover must be, and where the staple goes, and how many pixels are in a comma.  Legal writing is a lot more like regular writing than anyone wants to admit.  If you can regular-write, and regular-read the irregular-rules, you can surely legal-write.  Don't sweat it.
