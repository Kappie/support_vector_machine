I really can't wait until VBS, it sounds fun, and I get to see everyone. Then we're going to the movies. I suggest that we see The Terminal, then go hopping and see Anchorman. Heidi, you can just go home, then, because we really want to see it. I want to play someone DDR, but I don't think I'm good enough. Kukuku. Standard is hard for me... Goddamn white-ness... Makes me mad...
