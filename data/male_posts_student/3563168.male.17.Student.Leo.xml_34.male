It's not that I don't enjoy blogging, even though it sounds dumb, it's just that my shitty ass computer screws up every time I try and put something on the internet.  I can't tell why either, other than the fact that my computer is a piece of shit. On average, it takes me about 30 min to 90 min to update my blog. Most of that time is spent re-writing articles and wating for my crappy computer to restart. It really pisses me off.  Either way, I'm going to keep putting stuff up, but you should like it because it's a pain in the ass to write something.  If you want a joke, then how about this one:  Knock Knock Who's there? Richard. Richard who? Richard Simmons is gay!
