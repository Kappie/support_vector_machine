I know that I for one am never satisfied with my physical appearance and am always afraid of being embarrassed, and even though I am generally pretty outgoing and love attention, I'm afraid that someone will reject me or what I have to say because of how I look. These kinds of fears are even worse than regular types, like fears of spiders, snakes, and heights. The reason is that they are the types of doubts that encourage dangerous behaviors, eating disorders, depression, and even keeping you from making a stand or saying what you believe, which is in my opinion the most dangerous consequence.      Even more common fears, like being afraid of the dark, can be just as dangerous. They still keep us from doing things and living life. A person who lets a fear of the water control them would never enjoy a day at the beach and could never save a friend who was drowning. A chlaustrophobic person may be too afraid to take a subway or drive on a crowded road (which, while not dangerous, is an inhibiting inconvienience). You get my drift.      The important thing to remember about fear and courage is that fears are natural but shouldn't ever be allowed to dominate us. And don't forget that courage ISN'T the absence of fear, just a state of overcoming fear to do what is best for others.       -Hunter M.
