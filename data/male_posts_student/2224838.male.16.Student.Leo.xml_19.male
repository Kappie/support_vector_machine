Well, at least I have read the books already and I know what happens!   UPDATE:  You know I was just kidding too, right Nate? Oh, except for the part about having read the books and knowing what happens. It's not too late to ruin it for you. In a way I was kind of wishing you had seen it, so the thing about a guy puking behind you could be true. I guess I should give you credit though. That was a pretty good  urlLink trick  you pulled there.
