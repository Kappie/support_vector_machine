They got a new website and everything, it is down right now, but when you read this it might be up.   urlLink Click here bitch!! .  The gods of pop punk are back, and guess what?? They might be coming to detroit in the summer!! For more info go to Ben Weasel's blog on the side bar, and go down a little ways and you will see what he wrote about it all.  Unfortunatly here is what Weasel said about them making a new record:  "With this band? Not bloody likely, unless the earth starts revolving backwards and dogs and cats start living together."   However, he says he would like to do regular shows and tour again, but staying true to his unclear ways here is his summary of the whole matter on Screeching Weasel: Okay, so to sum up:  1. I have no idea what’s going to happen.  2. I kind of like it that way.  3. I don’t give a fuck.  4. It’s fun not giving a fuck. Trust me. Try it – you’ll see.   5. Fuck you (see #4).  That was a true Ben Weasel statement...well...we are all just gonna have to keep our fingers crossed, but we are on the list for the "rough" list for the tour that will go down most likely this summer, this is the list anyways: Detroit Cleveland New York Boston Philadelphia D.C. Pittsburgh Cincinnati St. Louis Chicago  Once again for more info, check out Ben Weasel's blog over there.  And I really really hope they come here...but still this is some great fucking news...
