Ok so everyone bring their pictures from Orlando cuz i want to see them and all the fun you had on the trip. I'm bringing mine but alot of them (from the Relient K concert) didn't turn out but.... anyways. Love you and bunches and see you well some of you tomorrow at the party. hehe. I'm really excited. Toodles.
