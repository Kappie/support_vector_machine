I've posted on my personal blog, which you can easily access by clicking the link on the left. I have put many lyrics and poems in my own blog, so it is kind of interesting. Also, while I am promoting things, check out my website! I have added a new poetry page (that works so far) and a games page is being developed as soon I get more Flash games, etc.  So, this blog is still being updated, just at really odd intervals. I apologize on the behalf of the Three Eye Witnesses Corporation. We will issue a statement later regarding this problem.   Stay Tuned!
