It was super kool. 1.)  When we got there, no one was there...it was neat.  Carly, Jackie, Landon, and Ky were on Ky's boat or sumthin'...so Brittany, Kyle, and myself were invited in by Carly's parents*who are really nice.....for canadians* 2.)  We were sitting in there doorway talking to Carly on the phone, and her parents invited us in, and since it's just a force of habit for me, I had already taken off my shoes, and was standing in the doorway with my socks on....it was funny. 3.)  We went downstairs and her mom was trying to tell us that we could make ourselves at home, but I had already hooked up Carly's Gamecube and was playing The Hobbit....which is a pretty kool game by the way.  A few minutes later, Conny just walked in the back door, and came in and sat down, and they all played a game called Labrynth...it looked pretty kool. 4.)  After about an hour, Carly, Jackie, and Landon showed up.*I was still playing The Hobbit*  Then Jackie and Landon and Brittany left, leaving Carly, Kyle, Conny, and me at Carly's....with me playing the Hobbit still. 5.)  This part gets a little fuzzy*I was concentrating really hard on that game*  Eventually a bunch of people showed up including Whitney, Rusty, Tom, Karl, Wittig, Jenny...I think more, I just can't remember them.  KENNY!!!!  I almost forgot Kenny, he was there too. 6.)  The people who left came back and I eventually stopped playing The Hobbit....and started playin' FFCC with other people.  *For those of you who are video gamely challenged, FFCC stands for Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles...it's an awesome game for the Nintendo Gamecube, where you use a Gameboy Advance as a controller.*  We all made new characters, and of course mine was named SpEnSe.  I was a black mage, Kenn was...sumthin'.....Rusty was sumthin' else....and Carly was this really hott character that had a huge boobs....How Final Fantasyish...:-S 7.)  We eventually quit playing and went outside with everyone else...and then we went down Carly's huge hill into her backyard area....and there was a river and we got jump it and it was fun..then we went to this field where we intended to play CTF later.*CTF=Capture The Flag* 8.)  Me and Kyle made plans to leave and go eat, which we did...but, on the way back to Carly's...I was runnin' and I stepped on a stick...which went through my shoe and stabbed my foot.....man that hurt, but Tom got it out with a knife.... 9.)  We went and got DQ and went to my house and got all black clothes for CTF, and then went back...and no one was there, they were already playin' CTF in this big field with a bunch of trees by her house. 10.)  This is getting really long. XD 11.)  We *Kyle and I* headed toward the game and we heard voices, so we headed toward them, and I told Kyle to be as sneaky as possible...I was sneaky..sumone walked right past me and didn't even notice...and just as I was gettin' close to the group..I heard "Get Off My Property!"  Then these people with flashlights started comin' down this nearby hill...so everyone started runnin' towards me...and no one really saw....and eventually we all were runnin' back for Carly's. 12.)  We all met in a field closer to Carly's, and that's when I realized that Keli had shown up.  **In the interest of saving space for the nice people at Blogger.com, I will sum up the next two hours in three words** I....LOVE...Keli! She's just so KOOL, and AWESOME, and CUTE, and HOTT!!!  That is all. Peace Out!  Spense
