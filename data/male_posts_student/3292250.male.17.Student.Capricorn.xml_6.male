Randy Harrison, the actor who play's Justin Taylor on  Queer As Folk . I've always thought him hot, but then found a new level of hotness when  urlLink Mark  pointed out these pictures to me of Randy in glasses. In case you haven't caught on, I like a cute boy in glasses. I don't know what it is, but I just find them really, really hot. If you haven't seen Randy's work, you should. It's amazing; but then again the entire cast and show ( Queer As Folk ) is groundbreaking and spectacular.
