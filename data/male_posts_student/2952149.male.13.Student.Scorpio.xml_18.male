Tomorrow will be cool when i gowith stacey to the movies. lol. Oh and i got in a fight with my dad over my hair, i got so pissed at him cuz he wanted me to get it cut but im tryin to grow it out. I won the battle but then i felt guilty.I think my bus driver was on crack cuz he like totally passed my bus stup today. That is all.
