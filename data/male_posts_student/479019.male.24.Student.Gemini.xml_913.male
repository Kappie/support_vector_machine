The movie essentially deals with an underlying issue within colonialism and postcolonialism. That issue is the idea of modernity. The Meiji Restoration (1868) was an attempt to circumvent Western imperialism, by essentially becoming Western. In this process that did things like adopt a Western-style constitution (1889), build Western-style buildings, and end the samurai warrior class (by 1876). I believe the movie takes place between 1875-1877.  It's a complicated issue, because if it weren't for these modernization attempts by Japan, it could have become like China. In the 1840s China had already lost cities such as Shanghai and Hong Kong to the British. These changes allowed Japan to rise to the status of a world power (and colonial power) by the turn of the century instead of being a colony.  The movie attempted to address the complicated issue of dealing with modernity without losing a sense of identity. The maintenance of the imperial line in the "restoration" and the use of it for the legitmacy in the new government was essential. The idea of  kokutai  implemented through out the constitution essentially made the government a constitutional theocracy. This was a tie to tradition.  Crystal is right in saying that the movie show how the ultimate result is modern Western ways winning, which sucks. However, it is an unfortunate reality. I actually applaud the movie for trying to deal with the complexities. But, I don't like how they made this a purely Japanese issue. They made it about shady Japanese officials versus the noble savage (in Crystal's words). They don't talk about why the Japanese wanted to modernize... it's like they avoid the idea that all of this is because of Western Imperialism. Maybe it's because the US was engaged in an imperialism war when it was released?   Another criticism is how only Tom Cruise gets the happy ending at the end. He lives and he gets the Japanese woman in the end. Why does he get to live? I would have been more powerful if he had died with Ken Watanabe on the battlefield, because that would have really showed how the idea of  bushido  changed his life. As  urlLink Roger Ebert  put it, "his shift is visceral, not ideological." Also does it imply Cruise is the last samurai? Because all the Japanese protagonists die! In the end, the part with the official and the Emperor is rather dull. So it's not really revealed if the lesson of tradition and identity is absorbed...  ***
