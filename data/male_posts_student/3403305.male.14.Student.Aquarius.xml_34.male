If i trip I will never rise just lay there and close my eyes And slowly fade to black never coming back I see no need to be a prisoner of reality a prisoner of what people say I want to live on my terms and allow others to do so too i wanna be happy thats what i wanna do I want to mean and i want to live i dont want to just merely exist in a sea of people, they pass by millions dying, millions cry That i dont know and never will reality is a jagged pill bittersweet forever wish things were better wish people knew like they could see im not insane im just me your all insane im just me  I dream of reality Of simpler things and Fantasies Of every thing that cannot be and everything i believe should be I dream of reality Of simpler things and fantasies I dream of Love Life I dream of thee I dream of reality  I need to find someone to hold so i can be told "I love you" and "I love you too" that is what i need to do a lover a friend a companion someone who's love will never end I may be young and foolish it all may be untrue its the only way to live its the only way  I dream of reality Of simpler things and Fantasies Of every thing that cannot be and everything i believe should be I dream of reality Of simpler things and fantasies I dream of Love Life I dream of thee I dream of reality
