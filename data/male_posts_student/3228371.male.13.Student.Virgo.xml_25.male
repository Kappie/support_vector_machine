I know that I talk behind a certain someone's back. (WASTEBUCKET) However, I've stopped. I'm trying to not talk behind people's back. I just can't stand it when people talk behind my back and then suck up to me right after that. They act like you're their really good friend but you know they talk about you. I'm so tired of this.  I wish there was a solution to this. I have one but it's not too realistic. I wish we could all just get together. Everyone. And just admit everything. Say how we feel about everyone. Openly. No lies. And then, we either forgive each other or we get mad.   I'd rather lose my fake friends than keep them. At least maybe then, I'd know who's real to me and who's not.   Elayne's right. Everyone's so fake. I'm fake sometimes too. But I try not to be. Now, the only people I'm fake to are WASTEBUCKET and S-GIRL. I'm not fake to Wastebucket anymore because I haven't been around her often so I guess she doesn't bug me anymore. S-Girl... I'm close to telling her how I feel about everything. That'll be the end of the relations between us, probably. I don't know.  I know that some people talk behind my back out there. I know. I don't know who exactly but I know there are people who do that.   I know that I'm not the greatest friend anyone can have, but I've learned so much from this grad trip and I'm gonna try to be a better friend. If anyone who's reading this is mad at me, please forgive me and give me time to change. I'm not the brightest person in the world and I'm pretty clueless about stuff. Please be patient.  As for the losers who talk behind my back and then suck up, I hope that someday someone can get it through your thick head that being fake makes you lose friends... I feel bad for you.
