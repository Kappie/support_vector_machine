Well, not that anyone reads it anymore... who am I kidding, I AM that arrogant. Sorry if you've been finding the same post too often.  I went swimming at Tom's until 1, that was fun. I've got to go back to Tom's for a band practice starting at 10... Scott,  if you're up and reading this before 1 PM, please phone my Mum and tell her things about whether or not you want to go into Cheltenham town or Gloucester town.  Keeping secrets is not fun, I'm having to about 2 people. One of them is a secret that doesn't bother me, and the other is just a little annoying.  Please don't see this as flirting, I'm doing this to get it off my conscience. Please, Marx, if you're reading this, forward it to Sam, or if you're reading this Sam... well, read it. It's not flirting or anything, just need to get it out. I've been thinking a lot recently about why Sam hates me so much, and why I'm scared of her. Basically, I've realised that although she is, in general, actually evil, what she did in going out with Marx isn't actually wrong, in fact it's the right thing to do rather than dragging it out for too long. Which happened anyway, but I believe that to be because she didn't want to hurt me. And however fucked up I was at the time there's no excuse for what I did. And in general what she said about me is true, I am annoying, and I am boring, I worked that out recently too. I've had some time to think. What am I trying to get across? Basically, I'm too sorry, I know that can't solve anything but it's better than mapping out the words in my head each night. I don't mean to hurt anyone. Marx, I'm sorry to you, Sarah too, Buzzy, Patrick,Beccay, Zoe... anyone who I've hurt unintentionally but selfishly, I apologise. *gets hit* Thankyou, Sir, may I have another! Not written as a question. It's shouted, so it should be ?! but that's angered surprise.  Oh, plus side; I made Â£12.50 busking on Dec 23rd. Minus side; my slide is out of line and the earliest it can be fixed is the 2nd. If I practice up till then there's a good chance of seriously damaging the inner slide, which would cost... a lot to repair. BUGGER. When you consider I've got the Gloucestershire Youth Musician audition on the 4th... BUGGER! I mean, I know I'm not anywhere near good enough to get it (I'm not insulting myself here, I know full well I'm not the best young musician in Gloucestershire, and that's like saying my hat is red and has "Cymru" written on it), but I would have liked to have been able to practice more.  I believe that I have done more revision for the mocks than most, as I've done 45 mins on every subject barr Music, French, and German. Not to say that's enough, I'm not good at exams so I'll have to do some more, but still... I want to get some good marks, what's wrong with that?  I ordered the sheet musics for Les Mis and Miss Saigon last night. When they arrive, that'll take my musical score selection up to 5 (not including Martin Guerre, which isn't mine, I'm just borrowing it indefinitely) . BENEFIT.   I may try and go back to choir next Friday. It's hard, though. John's not there... and Sam is. Apart from that, I know Richard well enough to warrent conversation, Max, Peter and Luke don't like me, not knowing why but I'm guessing Sam calls me a bastard or something, which she's perfectly in her right to do... alright, that's slightly harsh, sorry. Anyway, though... I don't know. Am I leaving the choir, or have I just not been there for a while? Lord knows.  Rereading that bit up there, I will almost certainly recieve some not entirely nice emails regarding my wording of my apology, but when I've been thinking of how to word it for a while... I'm not changing it.  OH and for some random reason I've taken to learning Swedish.  Quote of the (11) day(s): "Laugh Punicello! for the love that is ended! Laugh for the pain that is Eating thy heart."  From Leoncavallo's   On With the Motley/Vesti la Giubba   Love, Jon Roskilly
