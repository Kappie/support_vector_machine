Then my hitz got a lot better so i was able to put the ball down...casey jus told me to relax and jus keep on doin what i do all season, cuz i put all of the pressure on myself, but i have like 3 other guyz that i can rely on if i dont do the job...thats what i love about this team, everyone pretty much kickz ass...payce.
