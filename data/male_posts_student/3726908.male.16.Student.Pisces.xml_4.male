Human have been living in outer space inside various colonies and spaceships. A great war, the Militian Conflict broke out and created monsters known as Gnosis...   14 years since, people have been living in fear and uncertainty of these monsters. Various organizations began to start collecting "Zohars", plate-like objects said to be able to summon or control the Gnosis.   The Woglinde, the ship which Shion Uzuki is in discovers one of it, however no one could expect this discovery to lead Shion on a trip to save the universe. Along with KOSMOS; Shion's creation and other comrades, the saga of a lifetime begins...   Review:   Frankly, I have heard great things about it, quite a number of people I know of totally adored this game. However, it didn't bring that much fun to me.  Being a RPG, the storyplot must be an excellent one, but sad to say, i was not that impressed by the storyline of this game. Maybe it's because i'm too dumb to understand the complexity of the plot, or maybe because that is a second episode to this game, thus the first episode leashes out all the main questions without having any answers to them. The storyplot has a very strong science fiction feel and maybe even a little religious touch, sadly, I have no particular liking to either of these.   Another important factor to RPG has got to be the gameplay system. Xenosaga uses a rather strange way of battle system. Players attack in a somewhat martial art way. Don't get in wrong though, it's not in those Street Fighter way, it's turn based, the player would have to press certain buttons to initiate attacks which follows up with another attack, acting like a combo. Interesting at first, it soon grew stale on me. Also, as tradition to all RPG, magic is surely included. Termed as "Ether" in he game, each character have their own sets of magic which you evolve it to more magic. These magic can be shared among characters as long as you have the points to share it. Beign a futuristic RPG, Xenosaga includes as well "AGWS", a kind of robot whereby certain character can summon and sit in during battle, not a bad inclusion in my opinion.   Next, on to the game character's develop system. No originality at all if i may add, stats and  numbers are all over the place. It is extremely uncolourful and tiring. One interesting thing though, is how characters can develop their attack, points are collected in battle and then used to develop their "Tech Attack", "Skills" and "Ether". "Tech Attack" is the attack which you use in your combo attack, "Skills" is drawing various...skills like "Prevent Poison" or so, "Ether" as said before, is to develop the "Ether" of characters. This may not be original, but it suits rather nicely here, other than that, nothing else interesting.   As the game proceeds ,it may be more of a movie than a game. In about 60% of the storyplot is continued in the form of movie scenes. I appreciate the producers effort, but it gets players bored at times, especially for such a science fiction plot, players may not understand what they are talking at times. The only time where players are actually involved is during the dungeon fights and touring of the place, which in my opinion are too little.   Mini games are somewhat reasonable, but it proved a little useless and totally unrelated to the main flow. It's like the producers added in Side Quest for the sake that it's...Side Quest. In other words, useless...   Graphics wise, the game doesn't score as much as maybe, Final Fantasy X? It's impressive, but not eye catching. I would only deem it as maybe just above average.   Sound and music are usual as well. There aren't any spectacular or exceptional tunes one can relate to. Voices to each character however are really well done and selected. Definitely a plus for this or any game.   Overall, I don't really find this game attractive. Story being too complex, graphics and sound not that spectacular. It is playable...but i won't really recommend it unless you are an obessed fan of science fiction. Some scenes however, are quite funny...like KOSMOS stoic behaviour or a gang leader acting sissy.   Extra: I heard that the game "Xenogears" from PS1 is a continuation of the game, Xenosaga is acting as a prelude...So Xenogears fan may want to try it out. Also Xenosaga 2 has been produced. Make no mistake, i may not like Xenosaga 1, but i would play Xenosaga 2 nonetheless. After all, Xenosaga 1 is just the first episode. Xenosaga 2 may clear all doubts in Xenosaga 1.  Score: 3/5
