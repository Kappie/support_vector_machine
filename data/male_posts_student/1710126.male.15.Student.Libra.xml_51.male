I dunno who said it sux but methinks it rox...okae   WARNING: Spoilers don't read any forther if u haven watch or dun blame me for ruining it...         Firstly lemme give my point of view...Neo DIDN"T die...as alota peeps think he did...lemme explain...  you see when he exploded in the matrix world as agent smith, tt was only in the matrix...his body remained intact in the real world...and yah i m disputing the theory tt zion is in the matrix...tts not rite...the real world IS real...and remember when he went blind he could see the fiery orange outline of the machine programmes? I m quite sure that represents life, or perhaps electricity generated from the human body. It is proven by the fact that when Neo saw the claw grasp the capsules with the human body in it to attach it onto the tower which extracts power from humans in the AI city, it is glowing brilliantly, the capsule with the human. It is also the colour of the sun, and also the complimentary colour of the green flowing letters which represent the matrix, symbolic of the opposite of AI: life. And when neo so called died or lay motionless after the battle with smith in the real world on the source's platform, he was glowing brilliantly with light. This shows that he is still alive.   And the peace between the machine and the humans is mutual. If u didn't catch the exchange in the final scene with the oracle and architect, the oracle asked the architect if those who wanted out could get freedom. The architect said yes...exact words:  "do i have your word?" "what do you think i am? Human?"  This means that those who wanted to be free will be, but those who wished to remain in the matrix to have an easier life but sacrficing freedom will remain as human batteries... Yupz, and also the oracle said she suspected we would see Neo again...and she's always right...  Also, why Neo could destroy the sentinels and anything machine related is also sorta explained...he could reach into the AI source and control it. In the exchange with the counsel member in reloaded, the counsellor asked him what is true power, and the answer was the power to turn it off. (they were in the engine room or power plant or something of zion) The counsellor also added that if they turn the machines off, issit really wise? becoz without the machines working, Zion cannot survive, thus highlighting the theme of symbiotic relations between the two. Neo has power over the machines in that he could turn off the "switch". Why he could do that however is juz explained as because he is the one.  There r also many other theories tt tok about the french guy and smith being one of the ONES, and that Zion is another programme with neo trinity and morpheous being programmes to lead anamolies, the 1% of the human race who dun believe in matrix to ZION so they can be destroyed easily, but i believe that is not right because if so the oracle and the architect will know about it and yet in the final exchange they r saying tt Zion is in the real world, and there is finallly peace, so that disproves tt...  those who want a good arguement or more theories, come find me...if u r still reading i commend you on putting up with my thesis essay on the matrix...oh wellz...after all i am a lit student
