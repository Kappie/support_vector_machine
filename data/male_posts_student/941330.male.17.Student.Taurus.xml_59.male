HOLY CRISSCROSS there was a lot of wannabe link leaders. i guarded elyse and jen liu's precious belongings with my life...or at least my right shoe. mandarin, heather's a prime example of why freshmen are unconditionally worthless. she couldn't hear what i said cuz i have a strong accent...likely story! (actually she's right. oh well.) stopped by in creger's, where erik said in his creed that i was one of his two best friends...damn...that hella means a lot...yea sometimes he can be mean-spirited, but he always means well. and tina caused "half the class" to cry in her presentation, but she wouldn't explain why. (would it involve onions? lol jk) and jen chien also cr -- er, created a beautiful display for her creed. i only saw the outside, but it looked real cool. she forgot amita's pencil sharpener tho! and my peanut butter jar. she signed my yearbook, and talked with me if only for a few minutes...it's just the small things.  eng, whooped in the vocab game, then followed debbie and anitra to madame so anitra could read her fashion show stuff. mei was there too, she wore like platform shoes to feign tallness...worked somewhat. she had to redo her entire speech, but her french sounded cool. not like it'll be useful in life but hey, whatever works. debbie thinks cuttino mobley's hot. don't ask. and she's going to georgia over the summer...let's hope she survives. they left, then nicole (she of the huge pic in the yearbook showing off her pixelated photogenicness) condescended (vocab!) to hang with me as she went on a vain, hopeless search for tammy and kristen. she worried that they were kicked out of the activity center, but who would dare kick out appointed class officers? they're like...on a separate plane of existence beyond that of us mere mortals.   i went home and played street. biggie little was really easy to get. 5'4" and 90 lbs? what kinda boss is that. man the comp cheats so bad, they pack me like no one's business (even tho stretch has a crown in dunks but you kno how stats don't matter). they have people with 3/5 in dunks constantly slamming it over me. whatever, right now my team consists of me, stretch, biggie little, allan houston, and mike bibby. not too bad.   am i allowed to listen to b2k? not like i do or anything.
