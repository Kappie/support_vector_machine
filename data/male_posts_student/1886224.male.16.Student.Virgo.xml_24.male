Nothing much has happened since then except that I am finally hitting over .300 for baseball and last night I slept over my friend Jimmy's house to watch the Century 21 Home Run Derby. I had my money on Sammy Sosa but he didn't even make it into the 2nd round. Hopefully tonight my parents will let us stay over here at my place to watch the All-Star game. Go American League!
