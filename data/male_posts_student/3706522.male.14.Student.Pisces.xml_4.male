When I think of a good topic to write some stuff about, that's, uh... what I'll write some stuff about. Right. So, forward we go, or... whatever.   I currently don't have any particular choices yet, but I've been thinking about discussing (for the time being) video games, Time Cube (and I thought I was crazy), and of course, ME. Yes, me. I know you're not impressed. Just shut up, OK?   WS
