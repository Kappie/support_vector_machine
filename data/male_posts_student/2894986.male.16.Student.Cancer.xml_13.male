Wow, the time just flies by. But then think about it in a larger sense. Tomorrow the second of the Dowell clan will be graduating from college. It will be the second attempt for one of us to make it out into the "real" world. Theresa already failed at this. Maybe she will get this right in the fall. Haha.  Next, Mom AND Dad are both gonna turn the big 50 this year. Thats old. Haha. Just kidding.   Then theres me. I will turn the sweet 16 in a little less than two months. Clear the roads, Im coming. This summer we WON't have enough cars. Now, 2 sit there and do nothing. New drivers are the highest priority. Remember that.  And one of you, my siblings, get to teach me how its done. Sorry, Theresa, through experience and the input from others, I don't think its gonna be you. Haha. Or atleast when mom is around.  Anyways, congratulations Matt. You have succesfully made it through your education without failing a grade. Haha. You now have the right to try your hand in the real world. No, McDonalds doesn't count. We have learned something fro the first time. When summer is over, your room is gonna become something else. That ay you won't keep coming back.   Watch the Lamb run in the Kentucky Derby.
