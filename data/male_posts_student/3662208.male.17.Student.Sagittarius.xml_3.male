I seem to attract bad things, but I always live through 'em. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? Well, to wrap this one up. I AM LIKE A VIRUS, I WON'T DIE, I MULTIPLY, or something like that. I think a better closing would be 'Perseverance pays off', so just pay attention to that one. Well bye, bi, buy, and by.
