You can always go to the superb shopping center known as the Laurel Mall. But then again, going to the same mall for over 3 years every Friday night gets a tad bit boring. Right next to the mall is Hoyts Cinema, well Regal Entertainment or whatever it's been changed into. Movies never cease to be exciting but when you're forced to sit next to a 200lb man with a 7 ft tall man in front of you, it sort of ruins the experience. And watching people get stoned and smashed outside of the front entrance is only fun for about 3 minutes and 20 seconds. Let's see, you can always go to Bowl Arena to bowl a few games but it ruins everything when your high game is a 57. Best bet would be just to stay home and think about how everyone else in the entire world is having a blast this Friday night except for yourself. What a smashing time we have here in the lovely town of Hazleton "where all the birds go to die."
