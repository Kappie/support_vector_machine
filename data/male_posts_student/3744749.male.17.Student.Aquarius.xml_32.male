This guy, who was on a lot of some drug, went down the row of tables outside Pete's trying to bestow slurred enlightenment upon everyone in his path. He called me something along the lines of "cattle" or "sheep" or some other herd oriented farm animal, for reading a news paper. He was really convinced that he was a vessel of god, who was "totally blowing some squars minds". He actually claimed to get his news directly from god. People who do drugs are awesome and really depressing.  Oo...Got  Me Talk Pretty One Day  by David Sedaris today. Fuck yeah nigga. I'm going to furiously read the shit out of that.
