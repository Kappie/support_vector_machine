But if I had done that I really would not have had much to wear now would I. I have really not done much today except really just go for a walk and get used to all of the sort of BRITISH rules like driving on the wrong side of the road. But I am having a great time and I wish that I had more to write but being my first day I really cant write more except that I unpaked all of my clothes and I am going to go with my aunt to go and watch her teach at he college which will be alot of fun. I will talk to you all later.
