And, truth to be told, good that she was the one that called for I had resigned myself to the possibility that things were only going one-way down a two-way street for some time now.  It was a good chat. A lengthy one. And while she may have felt that she dominated most of the conversation, I didn’t notice, nor would I mind.  It went quite smoothly except for one awkward occasion. My fault really…it came from one of the few things that…well…I still don’t understand. But I must remember that  understanding  is not a prerequisite for  acceptance . Such is the way of most things in life. Of what is called   Faith  . We may not fully understand how electricity works, or how gravity works or even how God works. But all these are accepted. They are facts. Likewise when dealing with people. Especially when their actions, directly effected or used to effect, you.  It all takes time really. Just like so many things once again. I believe I may be limited in my thinking, that I’m not getting the big picture, that there is a piece of the puzzle missing in my mind. I don’t intend to dig up past issues, I’ve gone way past that, and may well be my biggest problem previously. No, I think I’m missing a current issue, and it’s my hope that when I do bare witness to it, everything will fall in place.  So are you seeing the big picture in the things and people around you? Or are you so caught up on your own limited view of issues?
