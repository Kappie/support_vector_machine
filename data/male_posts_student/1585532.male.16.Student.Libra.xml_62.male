Then I went back to watch Trigun (which sucked, not enough explosions), and then...VH1 Classic.  All Request Hour and We Are the 80's!  Oh man at this point, just...its bad.  Anyways, I actually kinda have a job now, and...I'm doing good at it.  And I don't have to leave the home!  Yah...I take care of our yards and stuff.  Lame, but hey it pays.  Forty bucks a month, which isn't  that  bad.  And seriously.  If you guys haven't seen Aqua Teen Hunger Force, you need to see what you're missing.  Check it out  urlLink here .  It's frikkin awesome.  Well, anyways...After being awake for an amazing 30 minutes, I need food.  So off I go.  [Insert catchy signoff phrase here]
