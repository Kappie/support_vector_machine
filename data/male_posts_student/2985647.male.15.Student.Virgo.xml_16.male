But it is still a year too late for me, as I went up there last Easter Monday when we were winning 1-0 until the 86th minute when Liverpool scored twice, the wankers. 4 and a half hours it took to get home that night, in the cold and rain. Fucking scousers. At least we done the double over them this year, so I can give certain scousers a bit of stick, from a tree:)  So little time left until the big GCSEs. Have to just ride it out until then though, no killing oneself, as that would be the cowards way out. Plus I'm gonna get straight As anyway. No bent As in my house thank you very much.  Well, g'night.
