I slept til´ twelve, then ate lunch and dozed around and read a bit. Bed... On the 25th I woke up at nine, did about the same until 6, when we had a 2 hour long and very pleasant barbecue. On the 26th, Steven and I went to the little town of Odenarde. It has a really beautiful town hall with a polar opposite information center. When we got there, we soon discovered that for some reason everything interesting was shut on Mondays. Guess what daythe 26th was.        So we looked at everything from the outside. There were two beautiful Gothic churches, and one incredibly ugly one. Then we visited the adjoining town of Edane (or something like that) which was completely destroyed in the 10th Century by the Count of Wallawalla because he didn´t like it´s mayor or something. So we had fun wandering about the ruins. After that we spent what must have been an hour and a half trying to find a pub (in  Belgium! ). We eventually got ourselves into Brussels, where we finally found our pub...        When we got back we had a quiet supper of delicious cheesey pasta with ham and capers (devoid of children, which was a pleasant change) and played MONOPOLY. I lost. Shit.        Today I went into Brùgge with Nancy and her friend, who dropped me off in the central square and said we´ll meet you here at 12:30 for lunch. So I wandered around Brùgge for 2 hours. It was really nice. After lunch (salmon salad) I walked for another 3 hrs, but I slept for about a third of it, so that doesn´t matter.....        ok, at my next destination, which I will be leaving for tomorrow, there is not a computer, so I will not be able to post until August the 11th. I will continue in My Diary. There is a gap of 5 days between the end of my diary (July 13) and the beginning of my blog (July 18)... I´ll fill that in when I get back...   If you want to contact me by post, then please check the comments on this thread... when she sees this, she´ll put the address up (you will, right Mimi?).     so tata till I get to see all you buggers in Wilmette!
