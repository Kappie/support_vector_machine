Domestically, the story has met with widespread disgust.  Politically it has met with calls for Rumsfeld’s resignation on the left and been passed off as not that big of a deal by the right.  Neither of these positions is correct.  The Iraq prison abuse is, of course, a very terrible thing.  However, it shouldn’t reflect badly on the Bush administration. At the highest levels, on the shoulders of the President, the responsibility for the scandal cannot be laid.  The president was simply never informed of the abuse.  He has publicly said that he was shocked and appalled at the images.  And, in good conscience, no man in his right mind could condone actions like this. Below the president, secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld cannot and should not hold blame for the scandal.  A shakeup at the military’s highest level, Rumsfeld’s desk, would only exacerbate the underlying problem causing the abuse in the Iraqi prison system.  Rumsfeld, whether you like him or not, has experience.  He’s been secretary of defense through a major terrorist attack, two wars, and countless minor crises.  Rumsfeld knows his job and, despite this failure, has carried out the policies set forth by President Bush excellently.  You can disagree with the policies, but you can’t argue that Rumsfeld hasn’t fulfilled his duties as the civilian leader of one of the world’s largest military. The real problem and what the media seems to be missing is the obvious systematic malfunction in the American military.  This disgusting, sadistic behavior has to be a symptom of larger problems.  No organized, high morale, disciplined military would ever allow anything like this to happen.  Only ridiculously low morale could possibly cause the blatant disregard for military procedure or even basic human decency.  Only at one time in American history has the US military gone through a similar scandal.  In the 70’s, following Vietnam, the entire American military practically cracked under social pressures.  A soldier was seen by the public as some kind of moron who couldn’t get around military service.  Who would want to be part of an organization that killed babies and burned villages, the thinking went.  Drug use was rampant, discipline lax, American military bases were trash-filled dumps, allegations of rape spread like wildfire, and the entire command structure was for all intents and purposes, ignored.  If not for radical military reorganization in the 80’s the American military wouldn’t have been prepared for even its most basic duties.  America would have been left defenseless.  The same problem is affecting the military today.  Soldiers overseas see a brutal, seemingly endless war, an American populace once again hostile to the military and the cause for which they are fighting, and no reason to continue to struggle.  Soldiers are obviously ignoring the commands of their superior officers and taking out their frustration on the Iraqis.  Something needs to budge.  We, right here at home, have the ability to change things. We all need to support the military.  Write a letter to your congressman asking him to get the government moving on finding the real, basic reasons for the lax discipline exemplified by the Iraq prison abuse.  When you see a soldier returning home from Iraq, give him your thanks.  Don’t allow people to trivialize the military for their service to you.  And think that service to this country immoral or useless.  This scandal was caused by apathy on our part.  All we need to do is show the soldiers in Iraq that we care for their hard work and sacrifice.  If that happens, nothing as horrible as what we’ve seen the past week will ever happen again.
