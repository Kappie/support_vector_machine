It starts off with acoustics and sorta sounds like some action Antonio Banderas spanish song.  Like, you know, fast and spanish sounding.  It made me want to write this post.  And here, then it goes back to how it originally sounded, full blasting metal outtro solo replete with drums.  Goddamn, thats a good song.  Continuing on about music, Rod god some 12 inch subs in his car and now feels the need to blast rap all the time (even moreso than usual) and all you can here is BBBBBBBBBBBBB    BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB    BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB    BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBbbbbbbbbBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBbbbbbbbbbbb BBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB and its super counter-intuitive.  Why listen to MUSIC when all you can hear is some synthetic bass?  Meh.  Some people, I tells ya.  Hey, did I ever say I took a leave of absence from volunteering?  Because I did.  Like last week.  Wow I lost track and forgot about this post.   Lindsey and Andrea chilled here lst niht for a bit, it was cool.  I never have hung out with Lindsey before.  End transmission.
