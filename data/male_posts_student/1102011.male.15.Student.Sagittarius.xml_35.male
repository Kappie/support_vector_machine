Sometimes in life we have to be selfish. Sometimes in life we have to be crazy in love. Sometimes in life we have to learn to accept. Sometimes in life nothing we have to be independent. Sometimes in life we have to keep things to ourselves. Sometimes in life there is no shed to cover over you. And that is when Sometimes you have to take care of yourself. Sometimes no one will be there to lend you a shoulder to cry on. Life is hard. We have to take life one step at a time. I have experienced bitterness in life.  No one will even bother to know your problems. People ignore you. You are hated. Sometimes it is just too taxing on me. I tried to commit suicide a few times. But I figured out that life isn’t ours. It’s just not ours. We are living for the sake of god. And by killing our self that means we give up on god. I have learned to believe in god, but not the religion. With that, I have improved drastically on myself. I have learned to love. Although she doesn’t love me, it falls back on me. I have to love her. Without her life wouldn’t be as perfect as it is now. And when I found out my best friend liked her. I was overly disturbed by that. But, to think of it now, its just so stupid to think that way. She’s not mine anyways. But the thing that is bothering me is that I’m the last person on earth to know that. Maybe I’m blinded by love. But, why? I am not going to sacrifice a friend for a girl. It is stupid and not worthy. For now, I’ve neglected my life. Because of this case, I’ve been so crazy. I know people hate me. Not just one or two. But a whole pack. Why am I so disturbed? Why? And now I tend to get clingy on people. I need someone to talk to. But, all I do is just bitch. I have to change I know! Life sucks. I really really love all my friends. I wouldn’t even want to lose a friend again. But, what can I do? As much as I hate to say this, this year would be the worst year ever for me. Because I lose friends as if I’m wasting water. And people hate me. ArRGhh! And for the record I’m also very pathetic and a hypocrite. I say that I hate my friends but, the real thing is that I just don’t want to lose. That is why I tend to curse anyone that doesn’t like me but the real thing is that I still have feelings for them. Maybe life is not perfect. Well, it is not perfect. Nothing is perfect. That is why I hate my life. I hate it so badly.
