After 2 strikes, 1 spare and a lot of high hits I came out with a pretty cool 113. I was very happy, this was one part of my task accomplished, the only part I could control, for the other part I could not, Lane 6 was my enemy...          The appropriately named Marshmallow Kimberley Anne Stirling seemed to be doing rather well, much to my taunts and boos. She was doing so well in fact it seemed that there was no way I could stop her victory. Anyway, after all was said and done Kim had beat me, BY 4 FUCKING POINTS!!! I was devestated, she'd only gone bowling the night before and got a pretty dim 50ish! I mean come on people, she had to be cheating. They had bumpers which kinda peed me off because if they didn't I would've pwned her ass. But I accept my defeat, and so the third fail occurred.          For those of you who are slightly interested here is the list of people and points (in order):          13: Daz, 38 points.     12: Fish, 39 points.     11: Drew, 68 points.     10: Hopper, 70 points.     9: Gemma, 75 points.     8: Anne-Marie, 78 points.     7: Jayne, 80 points.     6: Andy D, 83 points.     5: Phil, 84 points.     4: Becky, 85 points.     3: Steve, 99 points.     2: James (ME), 113 points.     1: Kim (BITCH), 117 points.          Love ya really kim :D          Anyways as you can see I OWNED all the other people, just seems I couldn't own kim      :(. Tomorrows task will be up tomorrow!
