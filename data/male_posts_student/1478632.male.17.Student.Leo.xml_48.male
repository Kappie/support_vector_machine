It's an all-expenses paid resprt so I'm just gonna hang by the ocean and drink expensive drinks and stuff. Yesterday was Alex's birthday. She's 15 now. In her words: "Wahoo." Wish I could talk to get more, but she isn't online muchanymore. Work kinda sucks now. I quit Market Basket, but summer camp is pretty bad though. The Renaissance Project gave up control of the camp since their grant ran out, so the Boys and Girls Club too over and has pissed more than just me off since then. I mean, even kids are mad about what's happening. I don't think it's good when the camp overseer spends more time yelling at kids than making sure she's presentable. She comes in a half hour late and sits down to put stamps on her wedding invitations...only to scream at one of the nicest girls I know because she didn't wear a camp shirt that day. What a fucking bitch. Now when I related that little episode it seemed like it was only a one-time thing. Not at all. Elaine doesn't come in unless she really feels like it. When she does, she's always late. One day she left to go to the Boys and Girls Club in Concord (20 minutes from the main camp base) and was gone all day. Turns out she wasn't at the Boys and Girls Club for more than a half hour before she left.We never did find out where she was or why it took her all day to go there. Then there's Steve. That guy creeps me out. He comes in the first day and tells the kids to call him Smiley. Now I wouldn't mind it if that were a name they made up for him, but it's just a little weird for a 26 year old guy to tell 8 year olds to call him Smiley. Then he starts holding hands with the kids. Not even only the girls, either. Later, he brings in flourescent pink fishnet arm covers and tells some of the boys to wear them. And all through this he is bringing in Spongebob Squarepants lanyards that are grimey and gross, and telling kids to wear them around their necks. I think he gets off from little kids looking like gay men. Speaking of Steve and gay men, he asked like 4 people to go to the "3on3 Gay Lounge" in Manchester. That just creeped me out. I was sort of offended that he would ask me about that, too. I don't know. Something needs to be done about him, and soon.  --Jake
