She was entirely civil, not calling me a git at all or anything. So... I don't know, is that a good thing? I don't know.  This Laura person, whoever she is, she's quite cool. I don't actually know much about her, but she's... yeah, she's cool.  Anyway, I don't actually have that much to post about, so I'm going to do one of those weird posts about current affairs.  The United States is insisting that all flights invading their air space be equipped, as it were, with armed "air marshalls". This is supposed to be as a measure against airbourne terrorism striking the States. British pilots are advised to ground flights if they have any concerns over the safety of having air marshalls on board. Personally, were I a pilot, I would not take off until the armed (!)policemen(!) were dragged kicking and screaming from my aeroplane. I am, in no way, keen on the idea of having these marshalls on the plane, for a few reasons;    I just don't like the idea of having guns on a plane in general. They're not supposed to be able to rip through the shell of the plane but personally... if it can't from point-blank then it won't kill anyone, which is the thing it needs to do.   People say that having a marshall on your flight would be a comfort. I disagree. The general public is made nervous by a police prescence, it makes you feel that something IS wrong. It accentuates the point in your mind that, although there's only a minute chance that a terrorist is going to be on the flight, that one could be on yours. Yes, they're going to be undercover, but you'll know that they're there.   As they're undercover... if you sit next to someone on a flight, and you notice they've got a gun, how are you to tell if they're a marshall or not? 50% would report it, 50% would assume it was a marshall. And if the someone in the 2nd 50% was wrong...   IF there was a terrorist on board, they wouldn't have to worry about a gun fight. They could just secretly pull out a gun and shoot at the shell, and bingo, everyone dies. How would a marshall know that someone had explosives hidden in their hat, or shoes? And if there WAS a gun fight... once again, they'd shoot the shell if they were going to die anyway. It makes no sense.   It's well known that when you close a door, someone opens a window. This applies to terrorism, also. Obviously. Each measure we put in place to stop it, people go round it. How do you think they're going to go round this one? You're going to get terrorist air marshalls, aren't you? Let's be honest.     Obviously, there are reasons for it. But I don't have time to go ov... I lie, I can't be bothered to put the opposite point of view in this argument, because, to be honest, it doesn't matter. It's yet another mindless bit of American "We've got an idea, and who cares that it might be the worst ever". I'm not keen on governments... at all.  Quote of the day: "I'm nobody! Who are you? Are you nobody, too? Then there's a pair of us, don't tell! They'll banish us, you know!  How dreary to be somebody! How public, like a frog To tell your name the livelong day To an admiring bog!"  Emily Dickinson's   I'm Nobody! Who are you?   Love, Jon Roskilly
