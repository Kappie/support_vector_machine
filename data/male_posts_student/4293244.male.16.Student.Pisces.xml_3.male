But alternative is now a source of some of the problems. I'd like to talk about a couple bands namely Modest Mouse and Postal Service and to a lesser extent the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the Killers, the Strokes, Coldplay, and the Hot Hot Heat. These are perhaps the modern day REM's, Pixies, Nirvanas and the like. The bands that revolutionized the radio in the late eighties and early nineties. Not to say that the Pixies sold out or that Nirvana ever changed but honestly Nirvana's brand of music was ready and packaged to sell. If you are a fan of Indie or psuedo-indie or as it is also called "lo-fi" then you probably know these bands and if you are a fan of mainstream music and older then ten you probably know the rest. Don't worry if you don't know all those names though you should, they've all had their share of airplay. They say that rock is coming back, which is in my opinion a good thing, anything that takes hits at country and rap is good. I would not listen to half the stuff that's selling if I was paid to. Actually that's not true, it's just a old expression, I think the more accurate statement is I would not listen to that music  unless  I was paid to. The problem lies in those trendy bass/volume pushing choruses where the singer starts screaming and all the young teens get pumped up and start dancing. It is an element found in every popular song, for the most part though it is very hard to discern if it exists at all in Modest Mouse's "Float On" which is not one of my personal favorites, a little to bland, a little too pop. Now if you listen to many bands namely Pedro the Lion's "It's Hard to Find a Friend" and a number of other albums you'll find that said chorus is all but entirely absent from the whole album. Other albums like Modest Mouse's sublime "Lonesome Crowded West" will blend the almost-choruses into the rest of the song and confuse you to which part is the chorus with steady drumming, crude vocals and random timing. After you've heard a couple mainstream rock songs it seems that you've heard them all, at least the chorus which to the mainstream rocker is the "heart and soul" of their songs. Which leaves their songs peicemeal. If you are at all tired of rock songs after four or five times of hearing them, you may in fact only be bored with the chorus that seems to occupy half of the song and always have felt lackluster about the other verses and riffs. If you ever feel this way or perhaps are bored with the mainstream music I would recommend the Postal Service which you've probably heard of but more importantly Ben Gibbard of the Postal Service's other band Death Cab for Cutie. Also the earlier Modest Mouse albums namely "Lonesome Crowded West" but you have to ease into the Mouse, listen a few times before you pass judgement and look beyond the vocals soon it will be something you love, then when you're confident in the Mouse look into "A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing to Think About", yes it's a long title that was the point.  And maybe if you have a passing fancy or maybe you're really into emo but looking for something else to listen to pick up the Anniversary's 2000 album "Designing a Nervous Breakdown" the synthezier in it is very sutble and great. If you're into sort of soft rock with great consistancy Pedro the Lion is a great band with the aforementioned album "It's Hard to Find a Friend" and also their new, much more popular album "Pedro the Lion" now to forewarn you they are Christian but they don't take the shotgun approach to it and they do cuss. Their lyrics are quite meaningful in those two albums and Jesus is rarely mentioned if you are a true Christain then that's a plus right? Other good bands include: Built to Spill, Neutral Milk Hotel, Rilo Kiley (female lead vocals),  the Good Life, the Decemberists and Iron and Wine. That should get you started. However when you know all these great underground bands and maybe you see one of them on Mtv with one of your punk friends, do the indie community a favor and don't call them indie, the last thing they want is that word catching on with the Mtv zombies. I mean sure promote their music, spread the word, but don't call it indie when it makes it big, you and I will know at heart it still is but it's better that the rest of the world doesn't.
