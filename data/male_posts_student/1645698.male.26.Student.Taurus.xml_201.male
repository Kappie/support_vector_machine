In any case, I really hope you're feelin' better, hope it wasn't too serious. Could I expect to see you in school today?   In other stuff, Owens and I have opened a very stupid site, that will be filled with ver stupid cartoons...I must stress the words... VERY STUPID . If you think you can handle it, or are just curious to see how goddamn stupid/mentally deficient we are, go ahead, the link's right  urlLink here .  I've straightened my hair, I look like a young Kurt Cobain with brown, slightly wavyer hair, and maybe some beatles hairstyle mixed in a little there. I can't leave it this way, at least I'm doubtful, don't expect to see this anytime soon.  I'm Deadinside, and I am too damn tired.  "I'm just a wreck without...my china girl. I'd wake up mornings there's...no china girl. I'd hear her heart beating...loud as thunder. Saw the stars crashing down..." - Iggy Pop, "China Girl"
