Not bad, but I think I should extend that average.  In about 155 words, you'd probably explain what you did that day and what you found interesting about it.  If that's the only point of my blog, it's stupid.  So that's what I've come to realize.    Seventy-two words later and I'm still going.  Today was the last day of school.  Lots of deep thoughts during the time after taking my finals.  First up, I had a U.S. Humanities graded discussion.  Honestly, I thought it was boring.  Usually the discussions are pretty interesting, but for some reason I don't think anyone had anything original to say.  It was a review of the year, basically.  Then I had a Chemistry final.  The Chemistry final was surprisingly easy.  I ending up getting an 87% without knowing much of what I was being tested on.  I went through the whole thing and used common sense.  Then I had an Algebra 2 final.  I think that was my worst final of them all.  I was partially out of it.  I could tell in the back of my mind I just wanted it to be over.  I just finished it as quick as I could, putting only enough thought in each problem to find a reasonable answer.  Even some of the problems at the end though, I sort of gave up on.  So I am no longer a Junior.  The death of my childhood is taking place.  On a different note, I now have until Tuesday to do whatever I want.  Then I have to begin basketball practices (camp).  I have about 4 days.  I will most likely waste every moment of these 4 days sitting around watching TV or doing things endlessly pointless.  That's what I'm up against.  Three-hundred nineteen words and I sort of still feel like writing something more.  This post is turning to be sort of artistic like.  I don't mean for it to be.  It just seems to be an interesting way to put a spin on it.  Me writing this much is a form of discipline.  I'm forcing myself to write some more.  Whatever more I write is probably pointless, but still I'm thinking.  What it isn't is me web surfing into the dead of night.  It's two-thirty already.  How about I go for the B- and get 600 words?  This post is probably the most unlikely in all so far.  Night after school ends and I'm making myself type more.  Why?  What am I trying to prove?  I don't know.  Simple posts are beginning to bug me.  From now on they'll all be like this.  Long and even more boring.  Before it was 'go to bed, you need to study' but now there's nothing.  Tomorrow there's nothing.  Tomorrow there's nothing.  Tomorrow there's nothing.  Tomorrow is Friday... thank God it's Friday?  No I don't even care it's Friday because Friday doesn't mean anything anymore.  Now that moments are not bound to days and weeks and week ends, Friday doesn't matter.  God doesn't need thanks for Fridays.  Imagine what God thinks when people actually thank him for Friday.  I can think of a couple probably.  'It was bound to happen...'  or 'Friday comes after Thursday, as I remember...'  We wait for these moments and then when they get to now, when they become the moment we're in, we have no response.  Five-eighty-nine and I'm almost done.  It feels like more.  I hope this summer I actually accomplish something.  I can remember summers past when all I wanted to do was sit around and do nothing.  This one isn't an exception but I know doing nothing gets boring real quick.  I'm looking at the Propel bottle next to my monitor and am focusing on the 'Kiwi-Strawberry' label.  Is there actually a flavor Kiwi-Strawberry or could they just not nail Kiwi or Strawberry alone?  Or maybe the demographics suggest more people are likely to buy it because 34% of the population likes Strawberries and 39% likes Kiwi.  Combine that and you've got 73% of everyone!  Genius!  I'm done.  Before Posts Written	 	289 Words Written 		45,026 After Posts Written 		290 Words Written 		45,682   1.7248299725569741081016585133724 word average change.
