I basically didn't haf anything to do for the day, so thinking and slacking was basically juz wad I did.  I woke up at 12:00pm, feelin realli tired and had not much energy to do anything. I skipped my breakfast and juz went on to use the com. I had my lunch like 1:30pm and after tt I continued using the com till dinner time. Obviously it was a damn slack day for me. While I was playing Winning Eleven 7, I oso thought about all those stuffs. Well, I prefer keeping those stuffs to myself for the moment.  After dinner, I continued using the com, den I watched the television. World Idol was at 10pm and I would not had missed tt for anything. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It juz wasn't the kindda standard tt one would expect. The judges, the contestants, the atmosphere, basically everything juz wasn't up to my expectations. I actually thought tt it would be pretty grand, but it juz wasn't.  Well, my pri sch fren finally got a hp to use, so it's so much easier to contact him now. He asked if he could cum to my house tmr. I said it was up to him, I've no objections to him whenever he asks tt question. Haha, well in the end he said he'll cum another time. Lil' pig did the same thing at nite too. Well, in his case, he didn't ASK, he juz TOLD me tt he might be coming. Now words frm Shawn The Great to the lil' pig: "Boy, this is my house! Not urs! :P" Ahaha, obviously I said no, not cus I didn't want him to come. It was cus I realised tt my whole family will be at home tmr, so it wasn't veri convenient. Yea, nothing much left to say. Cya! =]
