(If I keep up with this blog long enough, you'll realize that I'm pretty far left on the political spectrum, so when I vote, I'll vote John Kerry.) I had half forgot about the speech, though to my luck, one of my channel-surfing-happy roommates went to CSPAN, and I told him to hold on for a minute and watch.   About 15 minutes later, we were still watching. I thought the speech was pretty interesting, if not moving or terribly informative. The other three people watching the TV:   My roommate who flipped to the channel was only still watching because he felt the urge to giggle at everything Kerry said, like it was all ironic and politically satiristic without realizing that it was. I didn't even get what he was talking about when he crack jokes. Kerry would say something about job loss or inflation, to which the roomie would exclaim, "Haha, like he's going to fix anything. He's a goofball. Look at his hair! All politicians are dumbasses."   Roommate number two was staring at his laptop, looking at scantily-clad women or something, occasionally uttering a disgusted sigh at the proceedings on the TV. "Why in the HELL are we watching this? Isn't there anything BETTER on? Hey, look at this chick's ass."   Roommate number three (we shall call him "The Libertarian") walked in a little late, and before he evenmade his way into theroom, he blurted out something to the effect of: "That dill-hole Kerry, what the shit does he know about anything. What a cocksucker. What the hell does it matter what he says?" He repeated this every few minutes.   My favorite retort fromThe Libertarianwas about Kerry'sclaim that America is dependent on foreign oil. The Libertarian: "No we aren't!!!" What? If we only used US produced oil,automotive gasoline pricesalone would go through the roof. We simply don't have enough oil reserves to keep up with demand. Not that he was able to grasp Kerry's overlying point about alternative energy sources anyway.   However, my main point here is not about oil, or about my wide array of political differences with The Libertarian. In fact, I'd like my other two roommates to have the sort of vigor of belief that The Libertarian has (even though he's completely wrong! *rimshot*). Roommate number one doesn't care because the complexities of the political system have pushed him away. He's never been one to be especially political in the first place, but when a lot of politicians are saying the same thing or not much at all, it's hard to cut through it, and most people don't even want to try to cut through it. Roommate number two doesn't care because he's apathetic, which is both his fault and the fault of the democratic system to inspire him. This is an even more serious problem that roommate number one's.   A lot of people talk about the fault line between left and right wing, but I think the bigger problem is that of the fault line between voter and non-voter. Political parties and newspapers do not make the understanding of politics or the democratic process easy to understand. Sometimes people need to be spoonfed information until they are ready to take larger bites. About all you can get nowadays is large bites, and even with all the political fervor, it wouldn't surprise me to see lower voter turnout than in the last presidential election.   The political party that finally figueres out how to connect with non-voters and non-politicos will win lots of elections. The American people want things that they can understand easily, something that won't interfere with their work day or their free time. I just hope it's a party whom I favor that figueres this out, or a lot of liberals are in for a long, tough ride.
