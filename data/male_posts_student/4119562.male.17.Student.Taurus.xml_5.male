Today was a good day at school, except the uniforms, and the fact i went to the wrong class and had the entire office looking for me for an hour, but hey, it's me, what did you expect?  Band practice was kinda rough....Mr. Stough got really angry for like the first time ever.  He threw things and yelled....It was quite violent....but oh well.  Tonight was great though....I went to walmart.  Thats always exciting...laura also called me.  We had a wonderful conversation.  She ended up telling me that she liked me which was good because it saved me the trouble of coming out and telling her that i liked her....Wow...some things just fall into place.....life is good...       Danger is the most important fear you'll ever know; the transporting of refugees, the silent night is cold, and all the time we looked around because we were never told.....                                                                                                                                         -YES
