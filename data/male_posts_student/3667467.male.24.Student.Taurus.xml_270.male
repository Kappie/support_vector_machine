Last night we went to see Chris Rock perform. Before I went I told everybody that he'd talk about "being black and smoking crack." It was my theory that almost all of his punchlines ended with "black", "crack", or something else that kind of rhymes, like "cracka!" I was only half right. The rest are "b****" and "f***!" Of course everything in between was pretty insightful; a biting social commentary. But when going for the big punchline laugh, you just gotta say, "f*** b****, where's my crack!?"
