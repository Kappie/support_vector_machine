It's an annual convention that comes to edmonton where geeks, nerds, and dweebs alike can come together and pretend that they belong...i felt a little out of place here but not too much.    At the begining of the 2 day ordeal i felt a slight buzz from the atmosphere...then i entered the building. I immediately noticed that it really was a geeks convention, although there were mostly normal people there that may have had some geek like tendeansies, they were dulled by comparison to the stereotypical geeks that i saw. It was a frightening experience at first, people that i thought only exsisted in fairy talesor urban legends had come to life.I'm not talking about the people dressed up as anime characters, i'm talking about the actual, full-fledged, live-in-their-mother's-basement-til-they're-thirty geeks. There were greasy ones, skinny ones, fat ones, short ones, tall ones, every type you could imagine, they had all come out at a risk of exposing themselves to real sunlight. And let me tell you, some of them were really bad...so unbelieveably geeky it's hardly imaginable. Don't believe me? here's a little story to back me up:     During his Weekend at animethon Matt decided to take advantage of the slightly cheaper deals on manga so he headed to the dealer room. After some browsing and purchasing several Mangas Matt found his good friend Erin and decided to leave. But on his way out someone had noticed his awsome t-shirt yet again. It was truly one of the coolest t-shirts anyone had ever seen, it was a shirt that had pixilated weapons from Nintendo's "Legend of Zelda" with the words "Don't make me go Zelda on you". Matt had been complimented on is shirt all day, but this time it was different.    "I recognize the silver sword, thepotion, the bow, and the hammer." said the geek in the in the booth, "But what's that other one? a wooden sword?"    "Well it's pixilated and they only use 4 colors, of course you won't recognize it." replied Matt    "Well then what is it?"asked the geek.    "I don't know" said Matt feeling slightly annoyed    "you own the shirt and you don't even know what's on it?" accused the geek    "Okay, fine, it's a damned rusty sword" replied an aggitated Matt    "But it can't be, if it was usted it would break and wouldn't be that useful." retorted the smug sounding geek.    "not nessesarily" replied Matt again sounding all the more annoyed.    "Yes it would, rust breaks down the steel at a molecular level, making the sword very weak and causing it to break when it is used."    Erin stepped in at this time and draggedMatt awaypossibly because she noticed the annoyed look on Matts face thus saving the geek from a retort that may have crushed his little game playing world snding him into an obivion where a gek must finally accept that games aren't the real world and there's life outside of the little cartridges and 16 bit graphics of old games.     Actually i thought it was funny because i actually did have several things to say that would have just been really mean, but oh well another time perhaps.    for a anime convention i actually did very little anime watching, simply because i wanted to see the cosplay, which i had to wait in line for for an hour and was extremely dissappointed with because i had heard so many good things about it years previous. And i was just plain old disturbed by the guy that dressed up like a girl and started singing show tunes. it was all made better when i found out that my friend had won a prize for his cosplaying though.    The next day i spent most of my time in the place called Artist's alley getting drawings done. completely awsome ones at that which i had to wait hours for and fall asleep while waiting.    you know...i always seem to do this, i start writing and then lose interest and stop, oh well another time. but i shall put up some of those drawings that i got just because they kick so much ass.  -Matt
