I got two Xanth books (Piers Anthony, great author) and I got a Calvin  Hobbes book (Scientfic Progress Goes "Boink". I love Calvin, he is so awesome). I think I'll end the night with another Calvin  Hobbes quote. He made an awesome statement in the book I just read, I will tell you it.   "Some people are pragmatists, taking things as they come and making the best of the choices avaliable. Some people are idealists, standing for principle and refusing to compromise. And some people just act on any whim that enters their heads. I pragmatically turn my whims into principles."   I thought that was hilarious. Hilarious enough to show all of you guys.   Also I co-led worship tonight. That went specatcular. I loved it, it was such a great experience. I got a few positive comments and no negative ones. Before everyone was making a big deal about it. "You are singing tonight?" "Colin's singing? I'm going to watch him the whole time, just to make him nervous." Alright, those were paraphrased, but I can't remember exactly what they said. I think those people never realized that I've sang on the team before. Oh well. Next week is the BBQ/Pool party. Many of you may or may not know this, but I'm a bit hydrophobic, so I don't know if I'll go. I probably will and just not swim.  After youth we all went to Haicenda Crossings (a place where The Regal theatre is) and just had some time to fellowship. It was great, I pretty much did nothing though. I ordered a basket of fries and shared it with everyone, or just about everyone. Dominique was there and thats what made it even more fun.   Well, see how eventful my day was? I got nothing left, you guys have drained me of everything. No more to read, sorry. Goodnight everyone. "To make your job more bareable, get a hobby that's worse."--Calvin's Dad
