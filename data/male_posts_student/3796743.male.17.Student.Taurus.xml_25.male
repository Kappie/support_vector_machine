Then I had to go get my hair did. I'm still not sure if I like it yet, but I guess its cool. Then I had to go to take my senior pics! Wow....so taking these pics was cool. I hope they turn out well, I just do. I better not be ugly. But I did them at one of the best places around, so if they're ugly, its probably my fault. We'll see, I get them back in two weeks! I'll let you know. Then I came home. I am so tired! Then I watched the Olympics. It was so awesome. The women won the gold in the relay. And an American won the mens gymnastics. It was amazing because he fell down in the vault and was in 12th place. And they said he could not win, but he won gold. It was amazing. Almost inspiring, but I'm not about to go vault of anything ... yet. So yeah.  It was so crazy. After I took my pictures today. It all started clicking. And I started to think about crap. Ok, so senior year is almost here......it is bitter sweet.  Last year was so awesome but i am glad that it is time to move into another part of life.  I can't wait to make new friends and go new places.  Thanks to all my friends for making last year and this summer what it has been. This is a poem I jacked from somewhere, its pretty sad. I really think that I am going to be a wreck next year, I hope I make it through.     Never Forget  Our journey has ended,
