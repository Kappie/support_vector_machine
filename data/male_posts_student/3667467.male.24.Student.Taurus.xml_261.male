Please reply to this address to lavish praise upon our news team for their astounding journalistic prowess.  We also handle unsubscriptions.  Sorry, Virginia!  (There is no Santa Claus.)  Back issues are posted for reasons of archeological research at http://pub72.ezboard.com/bpublius and now at http://dissek.com/webboard for no reason whatsoever.  Skynyrd rules.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * PANTENE PRO-V IS THE BOMB  I lost my shampoo bottle in a hotel room in Chicago right after I checked out.  After going back to the front desk to ask if they'd seen anything while cleaning up, a delightful cleaning lady appeared like Tinkerbell out of nowhere and let me down a maze of corridors to the secret lair of the maintenance department, a Never-Never Land where lost items remain forever young.  She let me look through a locker overflowing with pirate treasure, but alas, no Eckerd-brand $1.19 Value Size.  Then came the magic words: "Take whatever you want."    There were clothes and towels, but that seemed a little shady.  I didn't come to loot, after all, I came for 'poo, so I grabbed the only bottle I could find.  There it was.  Pantene Pro-V 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner Classic Clean 400 mL (13.5 FL OZ).  The last month has been a renaissance.  Pantene's enriched "Pro-Vitamin" formula keeps my normal hair lustrous and healthy-looking from roots to ends.  It cleans without stripping and conditions with balanced moisture in one step.  My hair stays balanced, strong, healthy-looking, responding to my hair's structure to help bring out the beauty that's mine alone.  Now all I have to do is dispense product into palm and rub hands together, apply shampoo to wet hair, massaging scalp with fingertips in a rotating motion, work lather through to ends, rinse thoroughly, and repeat if desired, and all is right with the world.  I use it daily.  Even better, I know that it's gentle enough to use on my permed or color-treated hair.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *    FREDLINE NEWS CORRECTIONS  --UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan does not have an alpaca ranch in Arkansas.  He sold it in 1983.  --A recent obituary claims that Ms. Greta Pellington of Tonawanda died this Tuesday.  The publication of this pre-written obituary was unfortunate, as she is still very much alive and kicking, buried with her coffin.  --The FREDLINE NEWS Editorial Department greatly regrets its coarse reply to a letter sent in by a Joshua D. of Buffalo, who after describing himself as a "nonpracticing Unitarian" got the response, "Isn't that an oxymoron?"  The staff does not apologize for the error.   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * FREDLINE NEWS ANCHORETTE OF THE MONTH AWARD  Special congratulations go to Michaela Pereira of TechTV for winning the FREDLINE NEWS Anchorette Award for September 2003.

TomServo0:  "con·trac·tion n.  A word, as won't from will not, or phrase, as o'clock from of the clock, formed by omitting or combining some of the sounds of a longer phrase.  The formation of such a word."  jeff80:  i don't buy it  jeff80:  because in academic writing you can't use contractions because they're just viewed as abbreviations  TomServo0:  that doesn't mean they're not singular words, it just suggests they're informal  TomServo0:  "Edward80:  I would say perhaps an expression. Its like 1.5 words" "TomServo0:  that's stupid"   jeff80:  lol  TomServo0:  "Edward80:  Well, its not one word, and not quite two" "TomServo0:  get off the fence, ed!"  TomServo0:  the intelligencia needs you now   jeff80:  you're really bored, aren't you?  TomServo0:  "Edward80:  Okay, one word. that is my opinion" "TomServo0:  YES!  i win!"   jeff80:  i'm still saying 2 words  TomServo0:  geez, and you're an english major  TomServo0:  EVERYBODY knows a contraction is one word  TomServo0:  unless they're less than three minutes apart, then they are about to be 2  jeff80:  ?   jeff80:  i just gave ed the ultimate defense of 2 words  TomServo0:  send it over  jeff80:  "Edward80 : I say one, because there is no space or gap between the two words jeff80 : but the apostrophe says that a space exists, unlike a compound word, where the words blend together Edward80 : good point  jeff80 : plus, there are no apostrophes when you play scrabble!"  TomServo0:  ah, jeff, how many words are in this sentence:  "Bob's car is red."  jeff80:  that's a possessive  jeff80:  completely different  TomServo0:  it's an apostrophe  jeff80:  but it does't denote that something's missing  TomServo0:  in a contraction, yes.  but it creates an entirely new word while still referring to a phrase  jeff80:  no  jeff80:  what's the difference between Dr. and doctor  TomServo0:  what if they'd decided to spell "Dr." "D'r"?  TomServo0:  (that's a red herring)  jeff80:  yeah - i know  TomServo0:  Dr. and doctor are two different words that mean almost the same thing  TomServo0:  and one can't be used in scrabble, but so what?  jeff80:  what is the point of this conversation, anyhow?  TomServo0:  to discuss the 2 word proposition!  TomServo0:  and NOW, because i'm winning the argument, you're clintoning out!  jeff80:  no - because i never was really involved fully - since i'm working on important stuff  TomServo0:  mmhmm  TomServo0:  this will probably go in the next fredline news  TomServo0:  speaking of important stuff
