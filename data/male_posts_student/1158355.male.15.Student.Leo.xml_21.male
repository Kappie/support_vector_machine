First it started with like Luis Armstrong or like Frank Sinatra singing all melon collie and it started to fade into some fast loud punk song. Then there was two hot sounding girls on the radio talking about Hakuna Matata and when it came on, Paul and I were singing to it.Today was nothing but good stuff... I think. Well, not really, math was shitful like usual. Ms. Boccio is definetly the biggest asshole on this planet. So anyways, track was good because I pushed myself. When I got home from track with Paul, I went to the orthodontist to get more braces put on and replaced on the bottom. Then I went to get a haircut, now I look like a marine... it's pretty cool, but the peak is still there for all you ladies, don't worry! I went to get Zelda for Gamecube but I found out it comes out tomorrow, but that didn't put me down. When I got home, I downloaded like every song I know for some odd reason. Lately, I've been listening to so much music from 92.3 K Rock, the best radio station. Music makes me very happy. After finishing my homework at Paul's and checking out his Sports Illustrated Magazine (*SWIMSUIT EDITION*), I went home... typed this and now I'm going to play the drums... ouch these freakin braces hurt!
