After that I'm laying on the couch watching TV or in my room listening to some musicals or here in front of my computer. How sad is that? I'm sick of it. There's so much I want to be doing but I can't for one reason or another. So here I am rambling on and on about some topic that doesn't make any sense. Hell, I'm only posting to kill time. Why is life so crazy sometimes?
