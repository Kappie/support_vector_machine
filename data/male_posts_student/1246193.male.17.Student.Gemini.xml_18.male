As you can see it hasn't worked out too well near the links.  Oh well. No big deal, at least the links work-I think.    As most of you know, Star Trek is a large part of my life. You may laugh and think that I am freak(not saying that I'm not) but how many of you can honestly say that Star Trek is crap. If you watch it enough you begin to understand something about every Star Trek series;The underlying messages. Gene Rodenberry created Star Trek to be an intellectual show.  A show that made you think and wonder. Watch the show-there is no prejudice, no poverty.  Who wouldn't want to live in a world where the basis of everything is that everyone, no matter what race, religion, or species, is created equal?  Is that not what our country's government is based on? There is no greed.  A person's goal in life is not to get rich and get as much "stuff" as they can, it is to better your self and the lives of everyone around you. Can you imagine the world without hate?   When you think of a trekkie, you probably think of a 30 year-old man who lives with his parents and wears Spock ears to dinner.  Or maybe you think of weirdos at conventions who think that they live in the Star Trek Universe.  There are people like this, but most trekkies aren't like this at all. They are people who simply enjoy watching a show, and sometimes participating in it. They want to live in a better world, a better universe.  Next time you are in a group of people you know, look around.  Notice the trekkies.  They are probably the nicest or politest people in the group.  They want to live in a better world and right now their escape from this pretty sucky world is Star Trek. Conventions aren't groups of freaks that are dressing up to show off.  They are groups of intelligent people who enjoy the company of people that have the same hopes for the future.    Don't make fun of trekkies. They enjoy a television show with a deeper meaning than most.  You can have your opinions about Star Trek and trekkies, but do not make fun of them.  Especially if you have never so much as seen a show.  It is really quite sad that we live in a world that taunts at people and laughs at people because they want a better life for themselves and everyone else.    In the famous words of Spock," Live long and prosper my good friend."
