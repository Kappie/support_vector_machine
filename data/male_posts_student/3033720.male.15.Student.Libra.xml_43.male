I'm just posting this, because once again, I'm bored. Also, no  urlLink philosophical questions  or  urlLink inspirational thoughts  come to mind. So out of boredom and lack of material I leave you with the lyrics to a song I like.  Fruitcakes  By: Jimmy Buffett, Amy Lee  1994  --Spoken:  "You know I was talking to my friend Desdemona the other day she  runs this space station and bake shop down near Boomtown. She told  me that human beings are flawed individuals. The cosmic bakers  took us out of the oven a little too early. And that's the  reason we're as crazy as we are and I believe it."   "Take for example when you go to the movies these days, you know.  They try to sell you this jumbo drink, 8 extra ounces of watered  down cherry coke for an extra 25 cents. I don't want it.  I don't want that much organziation in my life.  I don't want other people thinking for me.  I want my Junior Mints. Where did the Junior Mints go in the  movies. I don't want a 12 lb. Nestle's crunch for 25 dollars. I  want Junior Mints."   "We need more fruitcakes in this world and less bakers!  We need people that care! I'm mad as hell! And I don't want to  take it anymore!"   Chorus:  Fruitcakes in the kitchen (Fruitcakes in the kitchen)  Fruitcakes on the street (Fruitcakes on the street)  Struttin' naked through the crosswalk  In the middle of the week  Half-baked cookies in the oven (Cookies in the oven)  Half-baked people on the bus (People on the bus)  There's a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of us   Paradise, lost and found  Paradise, take a look around  I was out in California where I hear they have it all  They got riots, fires, mud slides  They've got sushi in the mall  Water bars, brontasaurs, chinese modern lust  Shake and bake life with the quake  The secret's in the crust   Chorus:  Fruitcakes in the kitchen (Fruitcakes in the kitchen)  Fruitcakes on the street (Fruitcakes on the street)  Struttin' naked through the crosswalk  In the middle of the week  Half-baked cookies in the oven (Cookies in the oven)  Half-baked people on the bus (People on the bus)  There's a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of us   --Spoken:  "Speakin' of fruitcakes, how 'bout the government?  Your tax dollars at work."   We lost our Martian rocket ship  The high paid spokesman said  Looks like that silly rocket ship  Has lost its cone shaped head  We spent 90 jillion dollars trying to get a look at Mars  I hear universal laughter ringing out among the stars   Chorus:  Fruitcakes in the galaxy (Fruitcakes in the galaxy)  Fuitcakes on the earth (Fruitcakes on the earth)  Struttin' naked towards eternity  We've been that way since birth  Half-baked cookies in the oven (Cookies in the oven)  Half-baked people on the bus (People on the bus)  There's a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of us   --Spoken:  "Religion! Religion! Oh, there's a thin line between Saturday  night and Sunday morning. Here we go now.  Alright, alter boys."   Mea Culpa Mea Culpa Mea Maxima Culpa  Mea Culpa Mea Culpa Mea Maxima Culpa   Where's the church, who took the steeple  Religion is in the hands of some crazy-ass people  Television preachers with bad hair and dimples  The god's honest truth is it's not that simple  It's the Buddhist in you, it's the Pagan in me  It's the Muslim in him, she's Catholic ain't she?  It's the born again look its the WASP and the Jew  Tell me what's goin on, I ain't gotta clue   --Spoken:  "Now here comes the big ones. Relationships! We all got 'em, we  all want 'em. What do we do with 'em?  Here we go, I'll tell ya."   She said you gotta do your fair share  Now cough up half the rent  I treat my body like a temple  You treat yours like a tent  But the right word at the right time  May get me a little hug  That's the difference between lightning  And a harmless lightnin' bug   Chorus:  Fruitcakes in the kitchen (Fruitcakes in the kitchen)  Fruitcakes on the street (Fruitcakes on the street)  Struttin' naked through the crosswalk  In the middle of the week  Half-baked cookies in the oven (Cookies in the oven)  Half-baked people on the bus (People on the bus)  There's a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of us   --Spoken:  "The future. Captain's log, stardate two thousand and something."   We're seven years from the millenium  That's a science fiction fact  Stanley Kubrick and his buddy HAL  Now don't look that abstract  So I'll put on my Bob Marley tape  And practice what I preach  Get Jah lost in the reggae mon  As I walk along the beach  Stay in touch with my insanity really is the only way  Its a jungle out there kiddies  Have a very fruitful day  Hey.   Chorus:  Fruitcakes in the kitchen (Fruitcakes in the kitchen)  Fruitcakes on the street (Fruitcakes on the street)  Struttin' naked through the crosswalk  In the middle of the week  Half-baked cookies in the oven (Cookies in the oven)  Half-baked people on the bus (People on the bus)  There's a little bit of fruitcake left in everyone of us   --Spoken:  "That's right, you too. Yeah those crumbs are spread all around  this universe. I've seen fruitcakes. I saw this guy in Santa  Monica rollerskate naked through the crosswalk. Down in New  Orleans in the French market there are fruitcakes like you cannot  believe. New York, forget it. Fruitcake city. Down island, we've got  fruitcakes. Spread them crumbs around. That's right, we want  'em around. Keep bakin' baby. Keep bakin'."
