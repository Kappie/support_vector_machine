I have lost count of the times that I have got wet during this month, the times I lazed away at home, when I should have been somewhere else, just because I didn't want to go out in the rain.  How I wished it rained at night when I was fast asleep, and the days filled with pleasent sunshine, not too hot, mind you! Well son, these are the ways of nature, and however I wish, its never going to change.
