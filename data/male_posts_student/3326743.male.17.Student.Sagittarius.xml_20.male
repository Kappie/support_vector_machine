Mostly through screwing things up. =) But hey that's me. I could write for pages on everything I've learned at summit, seriously. I already have probably fifty pages of notes written out. I didn't even really want to go and the Lord blessed me so much anyway. It was awesome, imagine Bible conference, put in some real praise music, put in really interesting/helpful speakers, tons of Christian teens to talk/discuss/debate with about the different sessions, and make it two weeks long. Yeah, it was awesome. We should memorize something together... like take the whole year and do it. I've started on James. I've started memorizing the first chapter and now I'm working on finishing my outline of the whole book to get the main ideas before I move on with actually memorizing it. Well I have to go eat breakfast and go to work. I'm praying for both of you. God bless.
