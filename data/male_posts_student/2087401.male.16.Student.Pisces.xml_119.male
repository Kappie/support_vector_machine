Second off, Sophia is not my girlfriend either, and while I was thinking about remedying that about a week ago, I decided against it.   As my friend Glennie said, when you can't drive and you go to different schools, 20 minutes is a long distance relationship.  She is really hot though.  I don't have a girlfriend.  Never have.  Don't particularly want one either.  More on that in a later post.  My next post is gonna give you a little backgound on my romantic history.  It'll help you understand my attitude towards girls in general, and Laura in particular, as I suspect she'll come up again.  Plus it's a great read.  I'll probably post it on Wednsday.  Well, that's all for now.  Word to all my homies!  Peace!  All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.
