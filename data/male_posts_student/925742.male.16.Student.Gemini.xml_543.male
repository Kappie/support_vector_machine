He started talking to amy and i told him she was dating kevin, so i told him not to fuck around.  He asked if she was good looking and i said, sure.  Well he apparently proceeded to hit on her after I left.  I figured he would do something stoogish (as usual) but not this bad. I saw him talking to nate at one point when i returned to put my phone in the charger.  I said 'that's nate, remember when he was here once?". I assumed it was nothing, and theyre not having any of the facts. So I guess nate duncan is calling me a liar after i found out what derek said and tried to talk to her/him.  Why he's on her aim sn i don't know.    So yeah, I'm partially responsible for leaving aim on to send an album to a friend.  But its not like i can stop him from acting dumb.  Its kinda hard to do that when i don't know what he's doing.  Even if i did see him coming on to amy, wrestling the mouse away from him is not easy at all.  Anyway, i'm sure things will clear up with time, even if they doubt my acount.
