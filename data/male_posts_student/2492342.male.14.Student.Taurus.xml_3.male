I dont feel like writing long, intricate sentences today. Oh well. So i sat around...took shower...online..I went out at like 4 30, to calvary to fill out forms for the mexico trip, to savons, and then a haircut. Afterwards, i went to old navy. yay. i got a ball, since the other one died, and some shirts and stuff.  I dint go to my grandmas with michael for the night cause my aunt tiffany's having a baby.  Let's explain this story. She was like a troubled kid, cause she was born like during my grandmas divorce..and she had to go to finishing school and got kicked out, then went to college in redwood and i dont really know what happened. I hadnt seen her in years until like 2 weeks ago. And then we barely talked.She's like 28 er something, and it's brave she's having a baby without a boyfriend. She lives with my grandma and with my grandpa depending on the time. He lives across town, but i havent heard from him in years. Sad, yes.  Something else happened. I cant remember right now though. Maybe later ill tell you. I ahve to eat so i can take the big pill.   oh yeah, brighton imed last night while iw as watchign Titanic, and, my luck, i had the Aisha song away message. grrrreat. Hopefully shes on tonight again. I want to talk to her.  Much love  peace  ~alex
