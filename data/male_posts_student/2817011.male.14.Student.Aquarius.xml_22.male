I'm not going to be able to see him until, I think, around when school basically starts up again. I'm leaving for New Jersey[not Neon Jaguars. . .] in about 4 weeks, but I highly doubt that I'd be able to even talk to him on a computer of any sort. Ha, as if I'm going to "try" to call him? I can barely hold a conversation with him, it's so funny and soooo ridiculously sad at the same time. Plus, some people might get suspicious. . . But anyway, I'm going to miss him, I think?. . .Ha ha ha, of course I will^^;
