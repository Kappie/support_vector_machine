I could have called her to pick me up some gas line antifreeze on her lunch break so I could get home.  No biggie, just an inconvenience.  Thats all.  Piece of crap Nissan.  Guess I just have to wait until the temp goes above 30... like tomorrow.  even then, its only gonna be 40... hehehe.  Oh man...
