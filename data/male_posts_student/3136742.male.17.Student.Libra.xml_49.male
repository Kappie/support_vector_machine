Matt's supposed to be coming over with his new Schecter to jam. That sould be fun. Then, hopefully, we'll see  urlLink Modern Bliss  tonight in Newark, DE....  *woo*woo* [that would be the noise the Stones make in "Sympathy for the Devil"]  I'm stealing Cates idea of putting the comments on the top of the post, cause I think that will make me cooler.  I just remembered that Johnny was in Hawaii with a dislocated shoulder. It was funny how he was just floating in the pool with a dislocated shoulder and I tried to give him medical attention, call his parents, and make sure he didn't drown or start crying like a pussy, all while Kris and Dennis stood there, walking in circles, mouths agape, looking like a couple of fucktards. He dislocated his shoulder the night before his 2 week trip to Hawaii and he has to get surgery when he comes back... that has really gotta suck balls.  Christoph's computer broke, so he can't get online. There's no way I'm calling or mailing Germany to talk to him, but I need to plan my trip there for next summer. It should be pretty kickass. I'm going to abuse the shit out of him and make him take me to every European country I can possibly visit in a month. Must eat the entire continent!... It might sound sad, but I'm honestly not interested in the girls there at all. He just wants me to visit to  party and drink. I just want to go for the food. Oh, the food!  I have a thing on my elbow that looks like a burn, or a zit, or something... it hurts like a bitch.  guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!  I guess now is a good time to talk about THE DERBY EFFECT (to appease Kris). You see, there is a derb, a big derb, a big big derb, that you got's ta hug and squish da big derb. His name is Stephen Derby, and he is, among other things, a fat, amiable, squishable, bitter, cynical, crazy racist. Picture a caricature of a big fat chipmunk, then make it look more human, and put it in a NY Giants sweatshirt and big, greasy glasses, and you have Derby. And when I say squishable, I mean squishable. He's just so fat and jelly-like that everyone who meets him  has to squish him. There's just this effect The Derb has on the brain. You must squish the big derb. Must hug the big derb. Pinch his cheeks. Give'em big hug. Ahhh, the derb.   There's simply no other way to describe it.  Squeezing the Derb close to you has a chemical affect on the brain, releasing endorphins and skyrocketing serotonin levels, leaving the squeezer in a blissful euphoric state. Scientists have been unable to explain the effect, but much progress is being made. As we speak, Du Pont technicians are working on a formulaic explanation of The Derby Effect. "There's just something... good... about giving that fat racist a big, loving squeeze... We're actually working with Pfizer to encapsulate The Derby Effect and market it to treat depression." Derbulous secretions are non-narcotic and actually function as anti-oxidants.
