Life it seems, will fade away  Drifting further every day  Getting lost within myself  Nothing matters no one else  I have lost the will to live  Simply nothing more to give  There is nothing more for me  Need the end to set me free   Things are not what they used to be  Missing one inside of me  Deathly lost, this can't be real  Cannot stand this hell I feel  Emptiness is filing me  To the point of agony  Growing darkness taking dawn  I was me, but now He's gone   No one but me can save myself, but it to late  Now I can't think, think why I should even try  Yesterday seems as though it never existed  Death Greets me warm, now I will just say good-bye    Metallica - No Leaf Clover    And it feels right this time On this crash course we're in the big time Pay no mind to the distant thunder Beauty fills his head with wonder, boy....  Says it feels right this time Turn around, found new high lights Good day to be alive Sir Good day to be alive, he said.....  Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel is just a freight train coming your way Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel is just the freight train coming your way  Don't it feel right like this All the pieces fall to his wish Suck up for that quick reward boy Suck up for that quick reward they said.....  Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel is just a freight train coming your way Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel is just the freight train coming your way...... It's coming your way It's coming your way...... Here comes  Yeah, Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel Is just a freight train coming your way.... Yeah... Then it comes to be, Yeah... Then it comes to be, Yeah... Then it comes to be, Yeah... Then it comes to be, Yeah... Then it comes to be, Yeah... Then it comes to be, Yeah... Then it comes to be, Yeah... Then it comes to be, Yeah.    Red Hot Chili Peppers - Higher Ground    People Keep on learnin' Soldiers Keep on warrin' World, Keep on turnin' Cause it won't be too long.
