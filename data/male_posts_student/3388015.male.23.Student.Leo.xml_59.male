I spent about an hour shopping and called Cindy to let her know I would be coming in 15 minutes or so.  She said she'd need more time to get ready and so I simply went home and started cooking.  Laura came about an hour later and helped me cook.  We waited about 30 minutes for Cindy to show up but we started eating around 10:45 since we were leaving at 11.  Cindy called at 11 and asked me to pick her up, so I did, I went and got her, brought her back for a power breakfast and we were off for Darien Lake.  We spent a good 9 hours at Darien Lake, here are some pictures from our adventures.   urlLink     urlLink     urlLink     urlLink      Superman was closed until late in the day but we managed to ride it once.  Cindy was nervous but she got through it.  Laura rode the Ferriswheel, she was nervous but she got through it.  All in all, a great day of rides.  We also ate at the Beaverlodge restaurant.  The chili was bad, but the onion rings were great.  Laura dropped us off, I dropped Cindy off, and I came back at hung out with the cat, played a computer game for awhile and then went to bed.  Blah. :)
