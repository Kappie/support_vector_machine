Some people would have said that I had done well, but I just seem to want more. Many of my friends did really alot worst then me. Maybe I should really learn to be grateful. After all, there's so much God has done for me already, God's goodness is so great, that I should be wondering how I should ever be able to things in return. Although, I'll never be able to, but guess I should really give my life to Him. Ok, didn't post here last night, cause I was just totally tired after coming back from Kent Ridge Guild House. Was watching American Idol. It was very long, cause they each sang two songs. And I think it was a really good performance by all of them last night. I think Clay will win. He has many supporters and I don't really remember him in the bottom three ( I just didn't watch from the start maybe ). Either way, he really has a good voice, just that sometimes he has weird facial expressions. Then yesterday, we had Chemistry practical. It was a blunder by me yesterday. I was testing for the presence of sulphur dioxide I think. Then we were suppose to heat it until the Potassium(VI) Dichromate turns from orange to green. But I moved it out of the fire, and the chemical got sucked back into the other test tube. Contaminating everything. So I had to redo everything. Then the second time I did it, I added so much of Potassium(VI) Dichromate that it took so long to change colour. Then Mr Wong told me hang on there. Then heat and heat, finally turn green! But soon after that, one of my test tubes broke due to overheating. Argh...then the precipitate formed outside the test tube. Then the chemical suddenly shot out into the front bench...just nice missed everyone...hehe. But quite fun la. What a day. Today, it was really ok. Nothing much, except that my styrofoam plate broke when I carried my food back to the table...argh...then my mash potato and fries all fell out. Then, hungry la. So quickly when to get a plate of Mee Goreng just before the bell rang. Then was just so tired today la. During band practice I also felt like sleeping. Just remembered Mr Tan praised me again for my chinese composition. hehe. He said that one part of my essay about an adaptation of a story about patience was very touching and meaningful. I thought so too. I really like it. I'll post here. It's found in "I kissed dating goodbye" by Joshua Harris. Apparently, he adapted from another book himself. But guess I'll post it here tomorrow. They say I'm Storm. hmm...I'm strong and protective of those I love? Well, I really want to protect my loved once, but I often feel inadequate in doing that. And I don't think I'm strong. But maybe that's when the last part comes in. I do have alot of fears and concerns. As ZQ always tell me that I don't dare to try things. And sometimes, I just can't convince myself that I mean anything or can do anything for my loved ones at all. hmm...maybe I really have to work on that. Not bad, quite accurately. hehe...but no one's perfect la...just like everyone in X-men. Each of them has their own weakness. But I guess that's when God comes in. Hope I'll always remember that it is most important that my life is for God, but not how satisfied I am with myself.
