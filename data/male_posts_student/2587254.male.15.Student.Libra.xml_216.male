Unfortunately I did miss Bible Study this morning, but I still made it to joint service. So woke up, picked up Jason, and then headed to church.  Joint service today had Don Brooks speaking. He had a pretty cool message about the church, and revolved it around the story in Matthew where Jesus named Simon to Peter....well one of the Simon's. The one that didn't have a brother I think it was?  After service, helped set up for communion *which by the way after me and Gavin's ranting had much better behaviour from all* and then went home. Jason came over today too and we had Dim Sum for lunch from Dragon Court.  After eating we went to Roger's Video to rent a game. We ended up with Fight Night 2004....  And I've been playing it since which explains the shortness of my blog haha.  Finally got a Toronto trip planned out. I am officially going on Wednesday this week =), and the 6crew ft. David *hahaha doesn't that sound like a cheesy rap group* will be meeting up sometime in the next two weeks. Can't wait to see them again hahaha.  Anyways....that's my day. I got owned by Maisie at Minesweeper again, and was nice to talk to Niki again.  Anyways yeah....NOW that's it.  Later.
