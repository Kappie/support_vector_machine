Maybe it was that tomorrow is Ms. Nelsonâ€™s last day. She is my Physics teacher. I think she did a good job teaching Physics. She has a prosthetic hip and it slipped, so she is going to take medical leave for the rest of the year.  As you can see, I have changed the layout of the site. I'm working on understanding the new Blogger code implemented, and as soon as I do, I will add my pictures pages with this layout. Until then, there are still at the old address,  urlLink www.bungkwifa.com/bendover/photos.html . I can't wait for this weekend to be here! Tomorrow is pay day! Yeah!  As I was surfing BBC News, Berg's dad blames Bush for his son's death. I also read an article on Aljazeera ( link ) that says that Bloggers think that the video is a hoax. I don't know if you have seen the video, but I have, and it is kinda gross. But Bloggers make the point that no blood drops from his head when it is raised up, which could mean he was already dead. I have included a link to the article. Aljazeera is now in English, lol.  That is all for now I suppose. I may post more later, depending on my mood.
