Back at base, bugs in the software Flash the message, Something's out there, Floating in the summer sky. 99 red balloons go by.  99 red balloons, floating in the summer sky. Panic bells, it's red alert. There's something here from somewhere else. The war machine springs to life, Opens up one eager eye. Focusing it on the sky, Where 99 red balloons go by.  99 Decision Street. 99 ministers meet. To worry, worry, super-scurry. Call the troops out in a hurry. This is what we've waited for. This is it boys, this is war. The president is on the line As 99 red balloons go by.  99 Knights of the air Ride super-high-tech jet fighters Everyone's a superhero. Everyone's a Captain Kirk. With orders to identify. To clarify and classify. Scramble in the summer sky. As 99 red balloons go by.  99 dreams I have had. In every one a red balloon. It's all over and I'm standing pretty. In this dust that was a city. If I could find a souvenier. Just to prove the world was here. And here is a red balloon I think of you and let it go.   Gotta love German pop. For some reason this little song about the complete and utter destruction of every man, women and child on the planet brings a smile to my face.    One of my friends has been having one hell of a week. Im not going to talk about it, because its not my place to, but she got hurt preety bad. She doesnt deserve the pain and I hope she finds someone who can make her happy.  So, if she reads this, she can have herself a little smile. =)
