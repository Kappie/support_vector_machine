This morning, my temperature shot up to 38.5 degree celcius. My whole body was so hot that it could even boil a kettle of water... -.- ( Water boils at 100 degree celcius ) ... haha! i took the fever medicine prescribed by the doctor and about 20 mins later, my temperature calmed down to 36.8 degree celcius. Thank God! My mother suggested that I should go to the Chinese physican to consult him. Being an obedient child(ty :X), i obeyed her advice. I went down frm kovan mrt station to outram park mrt station, and took a cab down to Jalan Bukit Merah. The clinic was near the ABC market. I recommend u guys, if u're sick, go there to consult the chinese physican. I got 2 packets of chinese herbs to drink, which is very bitter. Yucks! But there's no choice, I had to gulped down the boiled chinese herbs boiled by my grandmother. NowI am feeling better and hopefully, I should go back to school tommorrow once again. =) Hope today not much homework too. I'll end of here then. Maybe I'll write more later. =D
