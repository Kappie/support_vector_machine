It ended up being ten substantive pages, along with an annotated bibliography, a first draft, and a million note cards.  Yeah, go me.  Then today I ran for secretary-general of Model UN.  I didn't expect to win, given that everyone was supporting Dan Asher, who did win, and who was really the better candidate.  Good people also won for undersecretary-general, including Madi who did this cool haiku thing with Aviva on bongos (though I didn't vote for her).  I think she may have gotten the idea from the poems I always put on my interrogations de verbes which she sometimes corrects; maybe not.  Anyways, good job everyone, including Matt K-K (also for whom I didn't vote).  Cool, my iPod mini just came.  See y'all later!   Oh also, I said some good quotations today but I can't post them myself so check Duke's blog.
