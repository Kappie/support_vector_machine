Other than when he got attacked by giant pea-sized squirrel candy machines (don't ask) and then he made hot cocoa but somehow stumbled upon a miracle drug that amplifies the effects of Viagra.  Yeah, well enough of that stough.  It was a boring day pretty much.  It was cool that USC took care of Mich-I-can't.  Then he just watched it snow for hours and hours and hours.  Still snowing actually.  He's got about 3 inches, maybe 4, on the ground right now.  But he made a new CD and it has a bunch of good songs and is for the most part a chill cd on it.  It definitely has some "pimp songs" on it.  Then he talked about his vision for his next music video.  If all goes as he is planning for it, this video will be awesome.  Well done and just stunning.  Everything perfect except for the quality of the videotape cuz of the camera.  This next one is hopefully gonna be filmed at Amed's house Friday (to)night.  Maybe get some hot tub shots in.  That would be great.  Nothing like Tyke's hot bod to make a video even more spectacular.  Gawd, he is soooo hot.  His masculinity is only outdone by his supreme sensuality and intuition regarding the feminine mind.  If only all his knowledge could actually be applied.  TiiNa (not Tina but TiiNa).  Well Tyke is kinda smiling right now for this weird reason.  Because of the song he is listening to (This Gift by 98 Degrees) he just pictured some really great girl reading his blog and smiling to herself and thinking about how much she loved Tyke.  Yeah, well that is a little weird.  So lovfe to you all!  Dottie is a hottie!
