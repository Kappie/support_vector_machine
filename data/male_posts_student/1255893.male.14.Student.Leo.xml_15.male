I mean I dont tell dogs " oh my good u r such a dog. what a bunch of stereotypical bull crap. If some guy likes football, so be it. if you find a guy talking about cars, go ahead and call him a gear head. But don't say they are " such guys". Because not all guys know about cars and watch football. And besides, it dosen't hurt to know a thing or two about these subjects. They can help to interact better w/ people who know about these things. And car know-how can help greatly if u r ever stuck w/ out help. Anyway, I know more girls that know about this stuff than guys. Would it b fair to call them men? I don't think so! Another thing, I have noticed that on some on-line tests, ( a gender guessing test ) that if there is a question such as what number do you preffer, they give you two choices. What if you don't happen to like any of them? are u supposed to just pick one? That could damage you chance of having the right sex picked. And any way, if you pick everything that would judge you as a member of the opposite sex should they say you are that gender? That just seems stupid to me. The only way you could tell for sure is by checking your birth records. I think you all get my point by now.If you don't you're either incredibly narrow-minded, or an idiot. so till next time.........keep an open mind .......please. Mabey I could finally get out of this little space I'm surrounded in if the people around me did just that.
