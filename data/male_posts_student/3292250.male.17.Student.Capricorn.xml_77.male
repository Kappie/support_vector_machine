I'm very pleased to report that I got a  4  on AP United States History (the only exam I took, so it's good I only got one score). For those who don't know, the AP tests are scored in two parts: 0-5 on the Multiple Choice, and then 0-9 on the Essay Portion. It's I-forget-how-many multiple questions and 3 essays: 1 Document Based Question (DBQ), and 2 Free Response. They take the scores and somehow combine them into a 0-5 score. So I did damn well. According to the stuff on the back, it's the equivalent of getting a "B" in a College-level US History class. Yay for me! Someone please remind me to let Mrs. Heath know.
