I started it because there's so many thoughts and ideas in my head. I think and talk about them for a while, and then I lose interest in them. Except for the few people and my poor girl friend who got bombarded by me, these idea were never made known. Although that might actually be a good thing, I still fervently believe that some day they might worth being examinated again.  Thus a blog is created.
