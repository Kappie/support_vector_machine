I always opt for a minimalist design. Rarely using any kind of elaborate design, and like the clean uncluttered design. That's what they request anyway. My inspiration? IKEA - Simple and practical. Hehe, but never been there. :P  Meanwhile, my client supposed to be in town today. Hopefully I can negotiate for a higher pay. ;)
