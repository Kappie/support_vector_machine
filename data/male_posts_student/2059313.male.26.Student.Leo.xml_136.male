It can't run or play as much as it had.  But I will remember all the good times.  The jokes we used to share.  The tears, the pain.  The countless hours of e-mailing.  And even blogging.  Yes, my computer was a dear friend, and before it goes... I would just like to say...  WORK YOU STUPID PIECE OF CRAP!  Thank God for warranties and tech support! ...and roommates' computers.
