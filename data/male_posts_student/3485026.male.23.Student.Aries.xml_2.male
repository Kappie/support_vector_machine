I have noticed how tired I am this last week, and how much I really need a break from law school, just a chance to recooperate my focus and ethic.  I am starting to experience with some user friendly linux alternatives to windows...in part due to my frustration in dealing with Microsoft products and in part to support the ideal of capitalism by lending support to the competitor.  I have even started using a different word processor to get away from the autoformatting that Microsoft Word always does and ends up annoying me in the process.  Anyway, I have also noticed that the urging to write something that I mentioned a few weeks ago has not gone away, but I still have no idea as to what and how and so forth...but maybe, after finals, something will come to me and I can start writing something.  On to some thoughts...  I had a discussion last night that made me think hard about being alone/loneliness and similar states.  Specifically, I am thinking about what distinguishes the two states.  I mean, one can be alone without being lonely, but what makes it that way.  As I am writing this, I think that I need to think a little more in order to make my thoughts a little more coherent.  I remember reading a book a few years back called "Solitude" and am thinking of going back to that book to reflect more on my thinking.  Anyway, I will get back to this...
