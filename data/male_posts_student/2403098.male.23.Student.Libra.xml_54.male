That would just be great, and we could kill two annoying birds with one obnoxious stone.  I did decide to pull one fun stunt, and e-mail my father to tell him the bad news that I'm not going to be able to graduate due to a little mixup.  I told him in the e-mail that I wasn't able to get ahold of him at the office, so I just was e-mailing him to ask what he thought I should do about my lease at my apartment.  Renew?  Move somewhere cheaper?  But long story short, I was having to graduate in the coming December graduation, I was super bummed about it, and ended the e-mail with "Do I still get a new car?  Just let me know.  Love, Mason"  You see, the deal is, I graduate this May, so I get a new car this May.  That'll make him really mad to think I would be so selfish as to blow off school and still ask for a little reward.  I'm excited for him to read that.  For a split second he will think he raised a complete shit.  Well he did raise a complete shit, but we'll blame that on mom, not him.  I just got finished watching "VH1's Fabulous Life of:  Hip Hop Stars 2004."  Really?  Okay, cause their lives aren't fabulous they are ridiculous x 10.  One guy, who I had never heard of but am assuming he's some sort of recording producer, had a toilet made of marble and gold.  I guess we all say "well if I had that much money I'd..."  But seriously, I don't think I'd go as far as some of these people.  I think I would probably work on that whole St. Patty's day/April Fool's day combination thing.    I'm so comfortable sitting on the couch.  I was debating on whether or not I should go to my trainer today, because I have been SO good about going for two months, and I only received four hours of sleep last night.  The deal-breaker was when I was too tired to get off the couch to go get the phone number to the gym off my keychain (4 feet in front of me).  I figured that probably meant that I wouldn't be worth much at the gym either, if I can't make myself stand up.  Me so tired.  Me want fried rice.  Well, I think that's about all you get for now.  You'll be back though, you always are.  I watch you come in here, read my shit, and leave.  You don't think I know you're doing it, but I see it.  I see where you're reading it from, I see how many times you're reading it and I see what time of day it is each time.   Just kidding, I don't.  Or do I?  Muaaahahaha.  Moral of the story:  see you soon.  Same place, probably a different time, and more than likely sporadic in nature.
