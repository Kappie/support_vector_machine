I slept straight till 9, when my pw fren's call woke me up...haha. Then i slept agn. Till noon. Darn.  Got addicted to playin a couple of pc games AGAIN...this reminds me of my sec3 end-of-year exam which i got 2 F9s for...nvm. Joo Fang mesged me durin the evenin. She was askin for help for pw, sayin she needed a Sec1 or 2 in the RI thru train. So i got her Yiling's bro, whom i remembered did not inherit her sis's genes n thus got into the premier school in s'pore. Think her bro's quite handsome; yiling said he doesnt look like her. Ha.  Tonite should be great! Besides the usual Jacky Wu shows,'Whose line is it anyway' is also on...its realli hilarious! "Welcome to 'Whose line is it anyway', the show where everythin's made up and the points don't matter...thats right, the points are just like the second person you ever slept with." After that i should get down to finishin trigo n the rest of the math topics...tom. I will (hopefully) start on the remainin physics topics...kinematics, uncertainties, etc.   Dost thou not see the light that glitters as so bright; Sleep not, want not, and then thou shalt reach an early end.
