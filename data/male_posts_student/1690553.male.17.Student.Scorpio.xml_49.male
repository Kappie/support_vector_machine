Looks like this page have enough hits to keep it on top of the list. Thanks to all visitors!  The same thing also happened to my friend,   urlLink Azra Ain . You'll also will jump straight to her blog if you search for   urlLink Azra Ain  and click I'm Feeling Lucky. Before this there are no relevant results if you search for it.  Finally,  urlLink Covertec  had replied my email enquiring to advertise for them at my site -  urlLink My Palm Guide . They asked me to pick a PDA case and they'll FedEx it for free in return for a link to them at my site and a review (a good one perhaps).    urlLink     I picked this one - It worths RM130-RM160   So I picked a black leather case for my Dad's Zire71 as when he bought it there's no free casing in stock and exchange it with a memory card instead. That will be his birthday present on 4th November. I'm using an old PDA so I doubt  urlLink Covertec  had any in stock. By the way, they must want me to review their latest product don't they?  - Sound of  Syukur  by  Raihan  -
