The  urlLink 'Hate Me, I'll Understand'  entry in my blog has brought us closer together.  She knows more about me than most now.  Our lives are similar.  We hide behind facades, masks that we create, so that we don't have to truly interact with out friends, so that we don't have to show our fears, worries and sadness, because we don't want to feel vulnerable.  But we want to take the masks off.  I am here for you Rhedyn, and I know that you are here for me too.
