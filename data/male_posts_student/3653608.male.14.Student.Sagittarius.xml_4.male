I actually did work, which is always a first, and I did a page for my Chemistry Analysis. Lame. MY MUSICAL IS NEXT WEEK TODAY!!! I'm gonna die so badly. I don't know all my lines yet, but I know most, I haven't even done one of my songs. I'm the lead and I hate surreya because she just hijjacked my computer and posted and I had to edit it. Lame. I spelled her name wrong on purpose by the way. I say Lame too much. Lame. I wonder how Kathryn did on her French exam. She must have finished by now... Speaking of French exams I swear I have my listening (Which I will fail) next. La... Not good. I love this new blog. It's so cool. I can say whatever I want on it, it looks respectable (not as good as scribblejournal but much better then my old blogontheweb, unlike Yas's which looks amasing. WINDOWS XP), and it has a decent comment system, so make the most of it!  WOO!
