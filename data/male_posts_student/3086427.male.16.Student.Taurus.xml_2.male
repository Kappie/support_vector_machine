Yours truly will then complete 16 years of life on this planet.My centre is Modern School,Barakhamba Road,The Factory's arch-rival. This heralds a higly busy April for me.Apart from doing work for the quizbook, FIITJEE classes will start, an eternal source of stress and sorrow.Class 12th is in full swing with Monday tests around the corner.Added to this the additional burden of SAT .I have seriusly started thinking about night-outs,a concept i first discovered in IIT,Kanpur.
