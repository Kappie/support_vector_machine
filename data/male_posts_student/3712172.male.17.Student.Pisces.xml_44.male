Hence why I am here typing this out now.  I haven't written anything new yet, I plan to do so later on tonight. I have to get to bed early though because I work 11:30 - 8:00 tomorrow. Which sucks because it is going to be busy and retarded. That's alright though, well, actually it's not.   Anyway I had a deep conversation with Nikki last night about a lot of shit. It was really cool considering I don't know her that well. But, in the same, I feel like I have known her my entire life. The conversation was pretty open minded and cool though :) I got a lot off of my chest.  As if I don't get enough off of my chest on here as well though :P It's a bit different when your talking to someone directly though, but this blog does me just as enough good.  I have ranged from, positive outlooks on life, to love and relationships, to society and its flaws. I have logged them all, will be cool to see how my viewpoints change in 20 years or so. Also my poetry has gotten me into all of this blogging shit. It's awesome to include a piece of my work on here for the whole world to read :)  Once again; for those who take the time to read, understand and think about anything I have said or put on here, I really do appreciate it. It's good to know people do that :)  .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site  |  urlLink My Poetry Portfolio   I am gone for now, I will post later on, hopefully with some new poems. Talk to you all later :)
