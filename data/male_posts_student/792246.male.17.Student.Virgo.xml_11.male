Expect incredibly erratic amounts of time between posts, because I'm a bastard like that. Hey everyone, guess what! My 16th birthday is still coming up, and if you can't think of anything to get me, be sure to check my daunting list on Amazon. I expect gifts from everyone I know even though I never give birthday presents.   My parents left for Yosemite this morning and I have the house to myself for three whole exciting drunken orgy-filled days. In addition to having to feed all our goddamn pets twice a day. I seriously considered "accidently" forgetting to feed that evil fish, but I have too much of a conscience or something. I'm using my sisters absence to secretly play all the video games she doesn't usually let me play, and I've discovered the coolest thing ever. Spyro the Dragon and Spongebob Squarepants have the same voice actor. If only one was as cool as the other. The second Spongebob DVD is being released a day after my birthday. Damn. Am I the only one who sometimes has the urge to buy DVDs just for the sake of having them and being able to put them on my shelf. It's an urge I often have to resist.  The other day I scared myself by having a very serious and detailed discussion with Jenny about what we'll do after high school. Not the basics such as where we will go and how we will study, but we discussed living arrangements, working(something I know I COULD be doing now), and all that other grownup stuff. Not that I'm not looking forward to some of it.  My neighbors scare me. One of them stood outside in the exact same position for like 20 minutes today. At least, he seemed to be in the exact same position when I started walking my dog and when I came back. I was afraid.  This is probably a good idea of how big to expect my posts to be. Most will likely be shorter. I know they're boring, but it's a good idea for myself to keep track of things also. Not to mention today was kind of a boring day.   The very first post. This was created a few months or so after I stopped updating PigeonDeath, a site which was failing suckage. Oh, and the evil fish are long dead.
