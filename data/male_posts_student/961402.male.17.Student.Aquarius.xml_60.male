Anyway, thanks to my unwavering dedication to time-management skills and organization, I was scrambling to get packed right into the last minute. With hours to go dad took me to the Home Depot for a few last supplies and a neat 14-piece knife tool dealy for my host dad. Getting home, the next 8 or so hours are spent picking out clothes, sealing them in ziplock bags, grabbing equipment, running through checklists, gathering documentation, double-checking things with my parents, getting last-minute advice, desperately trying to recall what little Spanish I knew, unpacking, repacking, and cursing paperwork in general.  By the time all was said and done it was about 1:30 am We had to be at Reagan at 4:30 am, which implied leaving the house at 3:30 am. With two hours to kill, I decided to make a mix tape for the longish bus, car, and exist times that were said to pepper the loose schedules of these trips. In between playing CDs right next to a tape-recorder, I cleaned up the debris from my frantic packing frenzy.  Around 2:45 the tape was done, so I decided to grab one last hot shower. Went ahead and did the whole Morning Hygene Routine (tm). Went downstairs to find my dad watching some unsuccessful mid-90's film in which Keanu Reeves plays the son of Satan, a lawyer. Had a breakfast of rice and reheated Indian food before my dad and I set off for the airport.  I was the first one there (for once) and discovered something peculiar about Delta flights: They don't offer any sort of check-in until 5:00. Three cheers for planning. Anyway, it isn't too long before Laura, then Mr Leary and his son, Mike, and the rest (Correll, Aubrey, Chris, Melissa, Erik, Kristen, other people whose names escape me right now) to show up and wait for the counter to open. Anyway, we get checked in, do the security thing, and settle in the terminal for a good, early-morning game of apples-to-apples. Boarding begins on-time :-D. Because I have a weird seat thing, I do some on-plane swapping with non-GlobalWorks-oriented adults to get next to Laura, where I fall asleep upon takeoff.  Get to Atlanta, get off plane, go to next gate (same terminal:-D) and lay down for a short nap. Just as I'm getting comfy, I realize that I don't have any of my tickets or documentation on me. If I had a bit more sleep I would have paniced, but instead I just ran back to the arrival gate, boarded the plane with a security guard, grabbed the documents from the pouch in front of my seat where I had left them, and raced back. I get to board the plane, switch seats, and fly asleep again. I'm pretty sure there was a bad in-flight movie at some point, and I vaguely recall some sort of lunch happening.  We land at the San Jose airport four hours later, wait in long customs lines, grab our bags (there was a short drama as Laura though her bag had been lost, but it came out a few minutes later), get on a cool little bus-dealy with extra folding seats (Laura, Aubrey, Correll, and me sit in the back, I think) and get our first taste of Costa Rican roads.  The United States has traffic laws.  Costa Rica has traffic suggestions. You know, little tips like "stay on the right side of the road" which you may take or leave as you please. But you get used to the oncoming trucks after a while. You know that scene with Harry Potter on the crazy Knight Bus? Like that, only with Correll instead of a shrunken head.  We get to the bed and breakfast, lug in our luggage (this is the first time I realize how big, unwieldy, and awkward my blue-or-purple duffel bag is) and hang around. Aubrey, Correll, and me marvel at the Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles covers on the bunkbeds and comment on the innaccuracies portrayed in the turtle's colors. Cards are played, suns are setted, dancing lessons are foisted upon us (I can dance, and by 'dance' I mean 'fail'), food is served (as is my first taste of Costa Rican coffee), more cards are played, and the extra two hours we've gained en route are spent just generally hanging around. Correll, Aubrey, someone else, and me were engaged in some sort of football (American) at some point. Sad. Sleep is welcomed.
