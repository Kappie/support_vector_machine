Boot got gotten, as it were, and he headed - more quietly than I thought he would - into the sunset.  He was a fairly decent guy with a biting sense of humour who could be a complete dick at the slightest provocation. You could say we got along but that would be overstating the situation - I think Adriano merely tolerated people, not sure there was a lot of liking going on.  The Glennis was under the weather today. He kept saying "I feel like a dog's ass" over and over and over. I clamped my mouth shut. "How are you so intimately aware of the nature of the feeling associated with a dog's ass??", "You look/smell/sound like one too!" and "It's probably genetic, what with being a son of a bitch and all..." all died in my throat. He looked miserable enough already.  I had a morality issue at work last night. I caught someone doing something pretty offside and I didn't know what to do about it. I managed to get the situation safeguarded so it hopefully can't happen again, but it's tough to be put between your friends and your job. I don't like that at all.  I just had a meal of chicken and sausage, reheated. I should have taken more time and made something appetizing - that sucked.
