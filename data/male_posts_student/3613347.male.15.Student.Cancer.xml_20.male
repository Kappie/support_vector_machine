She asked wat i would have written if i were given that.  Firstly, i gave the suggestion of writing about myself. I am my own Idol. I am unique. I have to go through everything personally, and i can only give comfort to myself by telling myself that what i have done is for my own good.  Next, i came up with Robin Hood. who else can be an idol than the guy who robs the rich and gives to the poor? I feel that he is a great guy who fights for the good.  In the end, Shu Ying chose to make her Idol, her very own brothers. WHich includes me and WenJun.   Dun wan type liao, need do my IH ws. Due tomorrow. Sianz........    OH YAR! I just registered my I/C today!
