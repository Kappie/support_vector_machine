I need a 78 for chinese next prelim. I believe I can do it. I know I can, and the journey starts now, the revision, and the mentality to never give up no matter how boring, stressful and tough things get. Yea. You just gotta push on, and pull through. Thanks to all my frenz for being there for me. I'm gonna push on, for myself, and for everyone that knows me and have faith in me. Okie, enouf of the motivation/inspiration stuff. Time for bed, if not, I'd never have the focus to revise properly. ZZZzzzzz
