I've been browsing for information on "The Pajama Game" and I've come across a whole bunch of shows I'd never heard of that looked really good.  I'm gonna start getting them out of the library, though.  As soon as I have time.  The list so far: Rent (just missed it -- Ergh!) The Last Five Years (Just ordered the soundtrack from Amazon) How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying Jeckyll and Hyde Blood Brothers The Civil War A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum The Producers Miss Saigon Little Shop of Horrors (Heard the Soundtrack -- Loved it) Pippin        There are more, I just don't have time to list them right now         Sophia: You're very unobservant.  I personally thought you were hotter back when you had long hair (I know you hated yourself then, but that doesn't change it).  I think something in between would be best for you though.  About like mine (Styled differently, of course).  But you're still really hot.  You know who else is really hot?  Christen Neary.  Not gonna elaborate anymore on that here, though. One more thing: I'm now on the spell bowl team.  We're doomed. SQEE!
