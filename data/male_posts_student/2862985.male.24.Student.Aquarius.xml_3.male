My friend and I first found Brownie at Simei, roaming the compounds of PetSafari. She was affectionate despite it being our first meeting. We decided we wanted to help this dog with the most trusting eyes. After being rehomed, she was sent to a farm without our knowledge. We made a trip to the farm and seeing how contented she was getting the full run of the place, we decided to leave her there even though we were initally against the idea.  Unfortunately, during our last visit, we found out that she has been tied up to a pole for the past two weeks. The people at the farm were willing to let her go and Brownie is now putting up at my place.   So far, i've had no complains, save for that over affectionate tongue and her propeller-like wagging tail. Behaviour: Excellent. Taught her basic commands like 'Sit','Down' and 'Up' effortlessly. Eliminates on grass. Sterilised. Not fussy with food. No known health problems as of April 2004.  As great a companion as she is, parents will be parents. My mom is adamant about NOT having two dogs in the house and I'm afraid Brownie's deadline is drawing near. I sincerely hope for someone to step forward to offer a temporary/ permanent home for the sweetest dog i've met, out of the countless dogs i've had encounters with. A mongrel she may be, but she's got a heart bigger than many of the dogs i know. I appeal for someone to step forward for a chance to fall in love with this dog I refuse to put on the streets. Give Brownie a chance, please do not dismiss her until you've met her.  If you would like to help Brownie, please contact myself (Kailing : 92733043) or Cassandra at 97917449 anytime for a bonding session. "  This is the mail that my friends are trying to pass around. Just like them, I hope for Brownie a nice home and owner. I can testify that Brown's really a sweet little dog who would wag her tail whenever she sees you. She likes only to chase cats and people on roller blades... I have only had her for one day, but I have fallen in love with her already. If not for my mum, I would have adopted her. Brownie Brownie Brownie.. I miss you..  Here's some pictures of Brownie (as requested by Simpleboi) :
