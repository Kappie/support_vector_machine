I can't wait to go Back-to-School shopping. I'm a dork, I know. But I love the smell of new backpacks, and paper and new folders. LOL. I have a feeling my feelings for someone arn't going noticed. They are, but I don't think this person believes me. I dunno if he is going to come visit me, but I know I am going to visit him in March. I hope he comes visit me. Anywho. My July 4th was FUN! I almost blew myself up! We had artillery shells, and the guy whose house we were over at had one to many beers, ok, about 4 too many beers, and he was putting the wrong artillery shell in the wrong tube, which caused the tube to explode, out towards us. LOL. It was fun though. I love Montana. I am going to apply to MSU and the University of Montana. Well I am outta things to say, so I might voice post last today. I wish Noe would called me though. Him and I haven't seen each other in FOREVER and he won't return my phone calls.
