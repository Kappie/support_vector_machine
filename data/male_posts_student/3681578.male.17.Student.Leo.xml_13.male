But I managed to breeze through all the stuff, including the physically exhausting taekwondo...and I had to go to class to save my cuts for future use...  So there...the next long test in Math 21 is now  postponed until next week and Doc Mara is now back his normal usual lecture-like self...  I can't even see him letting us use Scientific Workplace...maybe he thinks that it makes Math 21 way too easy for us, so he wants the more...er..."didactic" mode of teaching...hehehe...  I'm starting to get a feel of Joseph Salazar now...not just because he gave me a 9/10 in our recent quiz but because I now know how he behaves in class...  He does not discuss the "literature" of the text at hand but the ideologies embodied in it...in away, I don't like him (feeling Philo no?!) but come to think of it...maybe that is what we are supposed to discuss...but subdues the act of reading the text into only a stepping stone, a platform for class discussion, an mere element for the construction of the idea of what tradition is...  Also...engineering workshop (ECE 21) is now slowly turning into three hours of hard work...I came late last Tuesday and I regret coming at all...I mean, I should have rested at home na lang...though if I did not come, I would have to do make-up work next meeting so I'll be sorta behind so all the same...there...  PE was so unfun mainly because I'm sick...I didn't tell the instructor last Monday that I'm sick and just went on doing the kicks and stuff...but yesterday I told Jobet and he ignored me...He didn't personally ignore me, madami lang nakikisabat so he totally forgot about me telling him that I am sick. Period  So yun...I'll write more later when I'm in Ateneo na!
