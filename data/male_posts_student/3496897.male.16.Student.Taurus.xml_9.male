Classic tales of groups of young kids who set out to journey and change the world are still told to the young. Enter our main character Toboe (toe bow A), who has always been enthralled by these stories. He decides to make a similar pilgrimage, but on his own accord. Of course it was easy for him to do it because he was orphaned since his parents died when he was seven. His brother Taita (tie sha) however, has lived with his aunt and uncle since that faithful day, when he was taken out of his mother when she was dying. (Toboe never lived with his aunt and uncle because they despise him, even though he doesn’t know why) Toboe is all about making choices, whenever someone would ask for advice from him; he believes that you should never be bound to the words of a man who doesn’t know your true aura inside. He made the decision to go on his own so that his journey was his own passage (he hasn’t trust many people since that summer day.) His plans changed forever when he went to say goodbye to his brother, and he saw what awful things his relatives were doing to him. Toboe rescued him and let him choose whether or not he wanted to escape his life and go with him. After long thought, Taita decides to travel with Toboe and see the world for what it is.  Now as for me, I’m Vigo, (Veego) the narrator of the story (Don’t think that I don’t play an active role in this story though, I know your dying to see me in action.) Enjoy the story for what it is and enjoy Toboe’s many adventures of the wondrous world of M’iel filled with magic, charm, and romance. Also remember what Vigo says, “No matter where your travels take you, you’ll always end up on top.”                               Perfect Symphonies                                Chapter 1   "Wake up Toboe!" A voice from far off called. It had to be his annoying friend lance, who always brought him away from his daydreaming. "What do you want Lance?" Toboe said in a dejected way. "Well, what I want is for you to get up off the ground and come to the forest with me so we can get our job done before the head mistress gets restless." Toboe slowly rose from his once vegetate state, and then gently stroked his hair. He sighed knowing that today was going be another boring day in his meaningless life. Lance and Toboe made there way into the forest to cut some firewood for the fireplace so that all the kids in the orphanage could enjoy some extra heat as spring quickly was dawning on the peaceful town of Almott. You see, Toboe and Lance are the oldest people in the orphanage, (with the exception of the head-mistress) so they took it upon themselves to be the big brothers of all the children.  Toboe and Lance chopped some wood and decided to go to the waterfall before taking the wood back. "I don't understand you sometimes." Lance said jokingly. "I'm not sure I follow you." Toboe said. "Well for starters, it's the middle of winter and you decide to go to the waterfalls. Also, it's dead of night and all you're wearing is a long-sleeved shirt." "Nowadays, I don't feel things much. Inside me mentally and physically, so there's no need for me to use much needed clothes from the kids. Besides, I'm not going to go swimming; I'm going here to think about things. "What could you possibly have to think about? There's not much to do in our life besides helping others, and running around annoying people."(How true)  Lance was confused beyond all belief. He thought that Toboe has been acting rather strangely lately. He's been a lot quieter, not as social, and he seemed to be depressed or that he had something important on his mind. Now you have to be a little dense to not see what's wrong with Lance. (I will explain) Lance is a very plain person; he believes that all he sees is what is real. Sometimes, his "tunnel vision" constricts him from seeing the real problem within like in Toboe's situation right now. "That's exactly it Lance! We don't have anything; our possessions are also the possessions of the orphanage." Toboe started getting exited in his reasoning "So that supposed to make us happy?" Lance still didn't get it. (idiot) "Well no, actually yes, it means that we aren't being manipulated by greed for more like most other people. There is only one thing that we possess, that no one else can possess." "And that would be..." (His ignorance amazes me.) "The freedom of our imagination, the freedom of life, the freedom of life. No matter what, no one can deprive us of that." "That's some deep stuff Toboe." Lance finally got his thought. "I don't know though, sometimes it's not enough. I just wish that there were something more to life than this." Toboe suddenly lost all of his excitement and started to fall into a depression. "Come on now Toboe." Lance went over and grabbed Toboe's arm. He dragged him to the special spot under the water-fall. It was the special place that all the orphans would go to in the summer. They sat on a rock and thought hard about their life. "You're lucky Lance." 'No you are the lucky one Toboe. You had your parents until you were seven. I never knew mine at all. They must have really hated me to just up and leave me like that." He began to cry. 6/21 to be continued
