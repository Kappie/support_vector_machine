She cried when they put water on her head but then she fell asleep which was good because we were able to take pictures without her crying. We took a lot of pictures (digital of course...) and then we went to the reception it's real close so no worry. They played a bunch of old music but it soon got better and I danced. I talked to Terrah the most. She's really cool. Some of the little kids were annoying and I locked one in a room. (Well he started to cry and had to let him go, but you don't know what he did so don't go cussing me out, o.k I'm sorry...) Well he started saying perverted things and being a pain for a nine year old... Anyway.        Well I continued to talk to Terrah she's actually really nice. (My friend will kill me for using "nice") and well I like her ..........But she lives in the great  Canada!  well there's not much I can do about that. But it was nice to know that I could like again after the 2001-2004 tragedies. I'll get more into detail later about what I'm trying to say.
