I didn't want to but I guess when i look at my check i reconsider. It never really felt like a vacation. Im tired right now.. just finished doing foods project (I somewhat cooked for my family). 2morrow I have a presentation infront of the class on how to poach frikin Eggs.. JEEZ.. like who doesn't know how to do that?       Well.. now.. lets see.. During the Christmas break I had some fun time too .. More sleep time..lol.. I realized people at work get upset really easily and others can be a lil tooo happy all the time.. I guess the ups and downs of regular people are inflated in a work environment where there is always constant pressure depending on how you perceive your work. I take it as a fun job. I don't take anything seriously .. really.. but I do always put in a fair bit of effort sometimes too much. Well people I must cut this entry short because im more interested in watching a movie in the few moments i have to spare..otherwise I would rather sleep and get prepared for 2morrow.. lol. cya.. Will xplain.. some stuff.. hopefully 2morrow..night.. all...  ColdAsFire Aka.. ACZ
