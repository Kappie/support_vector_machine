My first instinct is to stand up for journalism and their freedoms (even if they don't exercise responsibility).  But then later, I begin to wonder if the bad guys should have this kind of access to media channels.  Yeah, I know there isn't much that can be done to stop it, so I'm reduced to forming an opinion about a journalist who would serve as such a conduit.     "'This video is straight from the mujahedeen,' journalist Michael Ware said as he viewed the tape at a hotel in Baghdad. 'This is the Blackwater killings. They talk about planning it. I can't believe this.' Ware, an Australian reporter working for TIME magazine, is walking a professional knife-edge, an unlikely go-between for anti-Western militants and the media."   The terrorists are becoming more and more media savvy, and by providing these tapes, they demonstrate an understanding of what moves an average Westerner.  Just as they calculated correctly on Spain's response to 3/11, they think they've got a handle on what makes an American react.    So should we be helping them in this way?  Is this responsible journalism?  Or is it the same as the non-stop Abu Ghraib pictures inciting more and more hatred?  I'm not sure I'm ready to render an opinion on this one.
