Actually, I had a couple of things in the back of my mind that I wanted to write about, but there were more pressing matters at hand during the time (i.e., anime, drawing, reading XP). So yeah, I guess I could just play catch up with this entry until I figure out exactly what I want to focus on... or, maybe not. So, what's happened since last I wrote? Eh. well, looking over the last entry didn't help much. OH! July 3rd! So the next day was the Fourth of July (shh. don't say anything). Now I remember. Well, let's start with the personal stuffs: Today, not much happened. Got bored, watched White Chicks the uber pirated version (>_ _Okay, now the fun stuff: Well, as I mentioned, I watched a movie on the fourth. It was kind of sad, I noticed, not the movie, but the moviegoers. There weren't too many people in the theater (seeing as it was the Fourth of July), and there was plenty of space. Everyone decided to spread themselves out as far as they could. No one is willing to sit next to a stranger if they can help it. I realize some people just like to be left alone, and if the theater was empty except for a couple, you wouldn't just sit next to them. However, people were willing to force themselves to the front rows and nosebleed seats just to avoid the proximity of others. We don't bite, honest! Well, not most of us anyways. Utter xenophobia. Somehow, I sense there is not much brotherhood among the public, even on the fourth of July. It is certainly a person's right to reserve his or her own privacy, but there comes a point when it stops being a necessity of personal bubble so much as just a detachment and distrust for human beings. Personally, I feel comfortable around most everyone (except, maybe, my family. heh), and I don't exercise prejudice, at least I don't think I do. And even if I think it (no one is without their prejudgments: it is what enables us to interact successfully), I don't practice it or dwell on it. I wonder just how much more we could accomplish if everyone stuck together, heard out everyone's opinion, and never jumped to conclusion. If we could just wipe out ignorance. Buuut, I recognize the fact that people may also reserve their right to remain ignorant. Everyone is a little ignorant in their own ways, but the hope is to ameliorate that, to achieve better understanding. One should choose not to stand stagnant mentally, because there is so much we could learn from each other. I think an obstacle on this path is the people's refusal to learn from and let go of the past. People use history as an excuse or a way to complain instead of analyzing it and progressing. People don't realize that those who are born now are not the same people as their fathers. They may genetically half the man their father was and half the woman their mother was, but what was done in the past was done in the past and not by the newer generation's hands. Also, when a mistake is made, I hope the parents recognize it and teach their offspring what not to do (again, analyzing the past). If we could break down social barriers, that don't even exist in the minds of children who have the simplest, fundamental form of logic, we would all be better off and could focus on more imperative matters at hand. _The other thing I wanted to talk about is the beach. Is it just me, or does everyone around you seem sexier than yourself. Of course, there are those who are confident in their prowess and physique. I, however, am not one of them. Like, even kids younger than me seem to have twice my muscle mass. It's disturbing and a severe blow to my ego or self-esteem or w/e. It seems as if no amount of push-ups and sit ups and whatever the hell else I might do would help my situation. About three times this summer I've gone to the beach. At no point, during all three visits, did I remove my tank top shirt. Granted, two of the days it was cold, but still... and then, there will be the people who jog by, and be all like, "look at how sexy we are and you aren't hahahhaa." What? no one else feels that way? Well, whoever said "no," you're the people laughing and flaunting "it." *sigh* I suppose there must be those who look at "it" and admire "it" from a distance, otherwise, no one would appreciate those who flaunt it. At least with this case, people  do  have the ability to change this, or so I think. Somehow, I have this feeling that genetics is against me. Like, even if I did eventually gain more muscle mass (and people, we're talking very little bare minimum, just enough to carry all the shit I need for school), somehow, my thirties would just murder my metabolism. "Yeah? Yeah? you like eating? EAT THIS! *kapow*" no more speedy digestion, no more I-can-eat-what-I-want mentality. I hope I NEVER, EVER,  never ever ever never never ever  end up a diet freak or a victim of a fad diet. I don't think I could ever see myself cutting out an entire food group or more, or having to "watch" what I eat. I mean, food is pretty interesting, but not interesting enough to watch at every sitting. I prefer to just consume the stuff. Stipulations: a) it's gotta taste good; b) it's gotta have some kind of health benefits; c) it's gotta have a nice texture (no soggy, mushy, craptastic-feeling-in-your-mouth B.S.). Simple enough, ne? There's always dangers with eating whatever one wants whenever one wants [Shakira reference (I can't believe I actually liked her at one point O.O)], but that's just a risk I am willing to take. I've been trained enough mentally by my family (although sometimes it doesn't seem like it), teachers, and mind-manipulating media to know what's good for me and what's not. And I'm certainly not going to live all paranoid of what doesn't have nutrition facts on the side label. Hm. Exercise seems the best and only way to go. Except the problem with exercise, is that it requires times, and it has that nasty side-effect of tiring you out (if you do a good enough job of it). If it weren't for those two factors, I imagine I would be in a lot better shape, but society demands more from an individual than performing well internally and externally, depending on what career one assumes. For myself in particular, there is no hope for the star-studded jobs of hollywood, music, etc. and besides that, I don't think I'd really be-good-at-it/like-it, you know? cuz' not everyone's cut out for anything. _Okay, well, that's it for tonight. Spamtastic spamu, signing out.
