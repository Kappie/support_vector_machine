At least, it'd better be by accident. >:( Also, I slept from 4AM to 11AM. I should have gotten up when I heard him leaving, but when I'm half asleep (or 80% at the case may be...) I don't have that presence of mind. XP Anyhoo, it doesn't seem that anyone is up yet to get over here and play magic. Bummer. In the words of Eric Dramstad: Less sooner.  EDIT: 8/1/04 5:04 PM I found the cards. :/
