Lets see, I flipped out on my friend today, she gets me really angry. She's just so.....Argh! Makes me want to hit something. So how are you? I listened to like the whole lot of that CD by William Hung, the guy from American Idol. I found it on the web and listened to the first couple of songs. They were hilarious! *cackles* Just great. Anyway, I'm out now, I'm bouncing, got to leave you alone.
