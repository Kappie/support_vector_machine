The reason for my extra ordinary ammount of joy today is; My girlfriend sendt me mail! and Today it's been a week since i last heard from her, which is way to long! The reason I havn't heard from her in a week is, she's in torquay - or something, some little place in england, she says it's quite beutifull. Anyway, I've been thinking *so* much about her the past week and I've really missed her, I've checked my mail every day to see if she had sent a mail, but every day (up untill today) I've gotten dissapointed. When I saw she'd sent me a mail, I think my heart may have jumped a little, atleast it felt like it. The mail said something of the lines of; "I'm having fun, miss you", fairly longer of course but that's basicly what it said. I'm so happy! I feel like running! I want to run and run and run, run overseas to england and find her! kiss her, make sure she's having a good time, then run back again! if it wasn't humanly impossible I'd do it! I'm so happy. I don't think she misses me a lot, I just hope shes having a good time and takes time to think of me every once in a while.   In other news;   I've completed two pictures today, a wallpaper consisting of several pictures I've drawn the last three days (check it out at jaypea.deviantart.com, it's called OC wallpaper), and a picture of a pirate rat (check that out too, still jaypea.deviantart.com, it's called pirate rat, I think).   I'm at a lan (I have been the past week, since she left).  One of my friends (it's his house I'm laning at, let's call him DilyX) father is turning 49 today. grats @ him.  Another one of my friends (let's call him ZarXoz) has gotten a cell today, let's welcome him into the world of the 21 century.    Thats today for ya.. so far anyway
