Later in the day still have to go to temple.  just now my parent and relative went to HDB to sign the contact, but was quite a busy day for them, they have to get a temporary leave for my granny so she can go and sign the contact and than sent her back to NUH for the electric thingy.  After that, my mum still have to bring my small sister and me to the temple to pray.  Usually it will happen before any big exam. haha..      think tonight will not be able to update my diary, cause tonight my newphew is coming down and he will disturb me when i using the computer.  Damn sian.. haha.. k.. shall end here..
