Talk about productivity huh? Oh hell with it I think I am going to come up with a short dialogue (Ohhh I love this part)  -*-*- *Kevin Waltz into the Bar* Kevin - Yo Bar keep can I get a shot o whiskey? Bar Keep - CAn't you read? This bar has everything except liquor? Kevin - Really, well then why are there have a dozen drunks sleeping on the counter? Bar Keep - Don't tell them but they think I gave them whiskey but ti was really horse tranquilizer. Kevin - Where'd you get that, I thought only vets could... *Bar keep pulls of apron and points at a sign* Kevin - Oh so your a bar tender and a vet Bar Keep - Makes my day just that much more interesting! Wake up in the morning and treat a few little girls hamsters for severe hiccups and then come by here and watch these guys go through my entire months catalog of various pet drugs and foods. Kevin - Really.... Bar Keep - You shoulda seen them once they got their hands on them dog treats, dang they must have had some special ingredient in them.  Them patrons went nuts. *A Patron wakes up very grogy* Patron - Annnnotheeeeer whiskeeey will yyaaa Tooom  -*-*-*-  Alright thats all I got time for for now I continue it maybe sometime in the future  Iggy :)
