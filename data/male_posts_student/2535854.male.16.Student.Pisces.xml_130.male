Then went to Great Eastern Life Mall in Ampang...Once again there`s not much there...went my Cold Storage their..which used to be Tops Market Place which was truly designed as an american grocery store and products...though its very high on the upmarket..very expensive...Kings Ice cream at TMC costs..rm6..over there at the now Cold Storage...rm7.50!Mad!Well they kept the look but several things such as waffles and cool whip gone =( ..Hmm Camelia was there..and she`s not as fair as she appears to be..Obviously they want to make her look much fairer in photos...Then went to the Guardian there..  Then went PBD and got Kfc and Donuts from Dunkin Donuts..sigh...When I living in Damansara before..,used to go to 7-11 there in the morning, get papers there and go to Dunkin Donuts and get Donuts..sigh..times have changed..
