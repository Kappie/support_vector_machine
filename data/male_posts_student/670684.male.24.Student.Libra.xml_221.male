I'm not upset...sunburns, hangovers, and lost sunglasses and wallets were the order of the day on a part of the river we didn't know, with tighter turns than our inebriated bellies could stomach.  But it is depressing to realize that we probably will never go canoeing again all together.    I've stayed too long.
