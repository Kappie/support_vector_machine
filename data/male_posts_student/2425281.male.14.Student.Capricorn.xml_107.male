Some bullshit and pictures should do the trick. Refer to coastal management.  2. IPT Assignment Only a small minority of ppl. Get firewire card, jewel case, Adobe Encore and Premiere, Audacity, microphone, etc. Editing and production. If you havent grabbed footage, dont panic, still 5.5 weeks. 15% and definitely dont screw it.   3. Maths Assignment 4 ppl. Aba, Lotto, Hazza and me. Do logbook, both personal and group. Suggest changes.  This probably isnt for everyone, but it might save you from going "OH SHIT!!" on last day of holz.
