Some of you who know what im talking about might know Mrs. Smirfy also. I met Dr. Jacky but didnt like him very much. Mrs. Bicardinia is doing well, but i still didnt see her as nice and sweet as Mrs. Smirfy. anyway, enough of my new found friends. I had a bunch of fun in Paris and Amsterdam, which were both great and wonderful citys. Amsterdam was the most interesting and crazy. Paris was beatiful. the plane rides were ok, i watched a bunch of movies and stuff...nothing big. anyway, i am now in Florida, and im having a bunch of fun. soon to be home. post later.
