So I have decided to change the title. However I shall alway be empathetic to the cause of graduate student economics. Especially as an Indian student I have always been amazed at our ability to ammortize the rent of just about any apartment no matter what the cost by making sure you can find anywhere between 3 to 8 roomates for a two bedroom apartment depending on whether you stay in Louisana or in Los Angeles.
