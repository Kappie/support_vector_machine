Also, Marten (there I spelled it right) do you still play magic?  If so, Tyler and I need a third person for and 3 on 3 sealed deck tournament on Saturday at the convention center.  Speaking of Tyler, he says his invitation to the blog has expired, would someone send him another one?  One last thing, I have the most bizarre final for AP world history.  I have to make a wood carving like ones made by the Maori peoples of New Zealand that represents me.  That's my final exam grade.  That is 25% of my grade.  How strange?   I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.  Nyerpe.
