I just finished watching his speech at the beginning of the Democratic National Convention, and the time he has spent out of office has, if possible, only increased his already massive talent. Eloquent, middle-of-the-road, uniting words that could only spring from the silver tounge of the golden boy from Arkansas. If, in my carrer I could be a hundreth the public speeker and the leader that President Clinton is then I will be more then fufilled in my thirst for public office. If you did not witness the greatest speech a Democrat has given in the new millenium, shame on you, and heres a link to a transcript.    http://www.dems2004.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=luI2LaPYG=131063ct=158734
