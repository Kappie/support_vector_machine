THANK GOODNESS!! *phew*   ]        yeah.. but sides that it was all fine.. in fact.. i went to watch irobot afterwards.. went to plaza singapura to watch the movie there with 2 of my friends.. justin which some of u may knoe and poh huat.. a guy that has a heart for girls.. most aniwae.. wait.. actualli ALL.. LoL.. anyhoot.. i was told that the movie was scheduled to start at 7.50.. so i rushed my way there and arrived at 7.40.. GREAT! the movie hasnt started yet.. met my friends at the ticketing booth.. then they told me the news.. the 7.30 show was sold out.. so was the 8.30 show.. left the 9.00pm one.. so we bought tix for that.. then waited at the carpark pavement for the movie to start and eat.. look like a group of homeless people like that.. then the trio started to walk around.. juz catching up wif each other cos we havent seen each other for a LONG time..      >sidethought     [ justin i knoe quite well.. poh huat not that well cos hes in srjc.. so kinda separated from the rest of the group that we had in sec 4.. ]          aniwae.. we hung out there for quite a while.. ok.. whu am i kidding.. a LONG while for the damned movie to start.. then bout 5 mins b4 it started both of them decided to by cheezy dogs.. basically cos it was selling cheap..       >sidethought     [ yeah.. cos they were selling cheap.. actualli poh huat is not much of a cheapo.. but justin IS.. ]       well.. i went to the toilet to leave them to there food delight.. onli to come out to find them wearing disgusted faces..       >sidethought     [ turns out the cheezy dogs were REALLI BAD.. in fact.. they compared it to a certain organ of the male body.. calling the cheeze oozing out having a glue like consistency and baically calling it VERY SICK.. ]       it was quite funny realli.. then we entered the theatre.. then reallised that our tixs were for the FRONT ROW..       >sidethought     [  damn.. =P   ]         so yeah.. now the movie was put in a whole NEW perspective.. everything being BIG and.. hmm.. i dunno.. blurish like and BIG?!! so yeah.. straining my necks as best i can.. i TRIED to enjoy the movie from this new perspective without trying to paralyse my whole body by snapping my neck into 2.. but yeah.. all in all the movie was GREAT!! to bad bout the whole perspective change..       >sidethought    [ lets juz say that after the movie.. everything seems so clear.. small and well.. clear.. ]     well.. it was a great experience.. let me leave u wif this quote by will smith..    *aaaaahhhhhhh chhhhooooooo!* "sorry.. im allergic to bullshit.."                                                                                                -Will Smith, Detective Spooner in iRobot
