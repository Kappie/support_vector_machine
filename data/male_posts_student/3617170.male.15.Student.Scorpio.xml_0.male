Spider-Man 2 comes out tomorrow, and I can't wait to see it. Hopefully it lives up to the first.  Ever notice how when you first wake up in the morning, you can't really make a fist? It just feels weird. Why is that, exactly? Seems to me it would be the best time for a fist, because you're pissed off you have to wake up. "Fuck, it's morning? Goddamn! Fuck, it's early. Gotta make some fucking coffee. Fuck!"   Oh, and just because it's my blog and I can write whatever I want: you suck, Kristin. :p
