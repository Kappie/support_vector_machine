You know, the one with AL the demigods and this crazy hippee that they killed, with AL those myths about fire and brimstone if you don't completely devote yourself to the cult... hmmm. Oh yeah, Christianity.  Christian-bashing aside, did anyone see that article on Alex Turner's brother and my Speech class acquaintance Josh? It was hilarious.  Speaking of hilarity, I think I'll type "The History of the World According to Student Bloopers," an incredibly funny segment of a book Ian gave me for my Bar Mitzvah. Stay tuned.
