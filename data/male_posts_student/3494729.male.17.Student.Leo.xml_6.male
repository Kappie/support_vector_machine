If people didn't think swear words were bad, would they still be bad?  Has anyone else noticed that television has made people so lazy that we have to come up with "TV" just so we don't have to strain ourselves and say a 4 syllable word?  Am I allowed to believe in luck but not believe in the supernatural?  Who else is really annoyed by people who only like bands no one's heard of, and then when that band gets all popular these people suddenly don't like them anymore?  Are smart people good at not doing dumb stuff, or good at hiding it when they do?  How many people do you know that you can 100% percent trust and depend on in any situation, however petty or significant it is? Doesn't this number seem awfully low?  Aren't songs more fun when you don't know the exact lyrics so you just kinda make up your own?  If pennies were taken out of circulation, would the average person save money or lose money?  Can opinions be objective?  -alex
