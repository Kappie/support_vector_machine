I guess that irony can be found everywhere, and is able to take many forms.  For instance, it was ironic how I came up with the idea that, in this blog we should just speak what's on our minds, but in the last blog that I had posted, I had no fuckin' clue what to talk about!!!  Well, yes,  Nick  was right about the irony thing.  Here's somethin' to think about!  Everyone look into their own lives and try to find irony in everyday situations.  I guess that'll give you mindless idiots a reason to use yer fuckin' brains!  Anyway, I noticed somethin'.  I haven't been writing long blogs anymore!  I haven't been discussin' issues on  The Punk Rock Editorial !  What happened?  I dunno!  But I've identified the problem and now I havta come up with some interestin' things to talk about on both  this blog  and the  P.R.E.   I got good reviews from  Nick , who I consider to be my  Blogger Superior .  Thanks a whole bunch  Nick !  I couldn't think of a better of a place to compliment you than our own dual blog!  Anyway, I still haven't come up with a good topic...and so the  graveyard shift  continues!  Stay tuned!
