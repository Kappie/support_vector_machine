This is my new blog outlook after some days of editing here and there. Any improvements please comment ok? ;) And also, please feel free to post in the tag board. Its quite empty there. Haha..Well, think it would not be too noisy as I only tell 4 people about this site.. hee hee..  Well, got back my results yesterday and its only so-so. Not too good but not too bad either... No complaints lah since I did not really put in any good efforts at all in the preparations. The most disappointing should be my CS4271 ba.. I got a B- for that which is like.. shit! Haha.. but well, I was late for almost 30 mins for the paper so no complaints again.. But still, I managed to finish in time so thats not a valid excuse also.. Well, in the end, it still boils down to being lazy and did not prepare well enough.. sighz... The most satisfying result should be my ST2334 (Probability and Statistics). Hee, you must be expecting me to get at least an A or something like that. But no, I only got a B+. The reason why it is satisfying is that I only did like 20%-30% of the final paper. I also expected an A for my MA1104 (Advanced Calculus) but only got an A-. Well, guess that being lucky in one module would lead to being unlucky in another so that it would balance out. Hee.. dunno what I am talking also..   Ok, back to today. Woke up in the morning and decided to meet my sister and Grace for lunch. Hence went to Suntec. Changed car with Dad today and his car is really cannot make it. Its so old and seems that it would break down anytime.. Haha..  After reaching Suntec, guess who I bumped into? Its Huiling and Fabian and Huiling's mummy! What a coincidence. It came somewhat like a surprise to me, maybe with a bit of shock. Coz it has been such a long time since I last talked to them and dunno what to talk also. We happened to be at the same place at the same time and taking the same escalator up. So a bit awkward. But nevertheless, I think over time it would juz get better. Hopefully I would become good friends with them again!!! I really treasure friendships a lot... Sometimes I just doesn't show.. haha..  After lunch, went to try for an interview at Sims Drive, opposite block 45. Yes, its just beside where Huiling stays. They are looking for salesperson for the World Book Fair held at Suntec for a period of 9 days in June, paying $60 + commission per day. However when I reached there, the place is full of people, mostly teenagers and I gave up. Dun want to waste my time queing up. Haha.. Besides, Ace is waiting for my car to use.  Went home and at night go for dinner with my family at Old Airport Road Hawker Centre. The food there is rather nice! Used to eat the Fried Kway Teow over there during army days. Oh Yah, and the Wanton Mee where we have to get queue number one.. how can I forget that? Fabian always order $4 plus a lot of chilli! Hee.. very nice food.. Yummy.. feels hungry again..  Ok la, thats all for today, would blog in again another time.. see when I am free.. haha.. Anyway the lyrics for the song played :                                "Thats What Friends Are For"                           And I never thought I`d feel this way                          And as far as I`m concerned                           I`m glad I got the chance to say                          That I do believe I love you                          And if I should ever go away,                          Well, then close your eyes and try,                          To feel the way we do today,                          And then if you can remember,                          Keep smiling, keep shining,                          Knowing you can always count on me,                          for sure, that`s what friends are for,                          For good times, and bad times,                          I`ll be on your side forevermore,                           That`s what friends are for.                          Well, you came and opened me                           And now there`s so much more I see                          And so by the way, I thank you                          And then for the times we`re apart,                          Well, then close your eyes and know                          These words are coming from my heart
