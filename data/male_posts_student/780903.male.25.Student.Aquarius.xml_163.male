They should have given out background on each job first, or some handouts -- because the only question you could ask would be "uh... what did you, uh... DO?"  And most of the jobs were so specific and targeted towards a certain narrow group of people -- "International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda," "Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch," "US Attorney, Western District of Missouri," "Farmworker Legal services of New York," "AARP Foundation Litigation" -- that I didn't really feel interested  enough  to actually go up and start a conversation.  The level of interest needed to get people to potentially rope themselves into a ten-minute conversation they don't want to be in is too high -- if they had more printed material, or it was a forum where each person got up and gave a short speech and then hung around for questions... I don't know, that may have worked better.  At least they had some free food.  Not enough for dinner though.
