Ever since this system seemed to go blank on itself, I've been trying to recover all this important stuff.  So it ends up, I managed to finally figure out why the Codecs for half my video files weren't working, and managed to reinstall them (I forgot windows was reinstalled, so it had a new directory).  Anyway, this let me watch "Friday" which I'd spent the last few days trying to download.  It's a pretty good movie, nice waste of time for me.  While it's still fresh in my mind, I kind of have really began to understand Corey Booker from a larger perspective. I can understand his critics more now, and I've come to identify him strongly with black public figures like Tony Brown, and Johnathan Fareley.  The thing I find most interesting about the later two is that they are symbols of the black upper-class (don't wanna use the commie word for it), having grown up their entire life in privelege.  What's most unique to them though, is they always seemed to know they were black and "work with it".  While people like Amiri Baraka, for example, would go "Oh damn! I'm black!".  This would seem to give them a good outlook, but their viewpoint is slightly off kilter.  They have had reinforcement from their parents, but it would seem the social element of "race" is gone.  It seems to show in Bookers politics, but it also seems to isolate him from the rest of the black community that he's trying to defend.  It's quite ironic, because to be in his posistion is to lose quite a bit for progress.  In an ideal society he'd be the symbol of success, but the reality is this guy is a member of the black upper class, and unlike the Early 20th century where people like DuBois would be the leaders, people now wants leaders they can relate to.  It would seem a prophets are bad with timing.  I'm going to count sheep now.
