So now I'm probably going to destroy my coversation booklet in the most imaginative and original way I can think of, then do bugger all for the rest of 'study leave'. Well, not quite.  Tomorrow I'm going to kill myself playing tennis and badminton, and riding there and back on *ohmygodno*  the stream bike  which I rode back from Mats today. It is a seriously dangerous thing to ride. Its so small my knees are almost hitting my chin when I sit down on it. If I try to stand up on it I can't because the handlebars are too low. The back brakes don't work at all. The front brakes barely work at all. If you don't want to crash you just throw yourself off the side. The tyres have been filled with compressed air (sarcastic thanks to Mat) to the extent that its impossible to go up or down kerbs without causing yourself grevious bodily harm. What else...oh, right. Its a pile of rusty and useless metal crap. Yaaaaaaay.  Only...8 more days of school left? Erk its gone quickly.
