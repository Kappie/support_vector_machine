I explained it in an e-mail I sent to my parents:  "Just to let you know, if my grade isn’t very good in English this 6-weeks, thank Ms. Welch- she made us fail a test because she made us do it over a book we hadn’t been assigned to read.  We came into class today, and she said “We’re doing a test over the 14 chapters you were supposed to read by today” and NOBODY knew what she was talking about. She said “well I told you last time I was here! The sub gave you an assignment!”  The truth was, the last time she was here, all she said was “We’re going to watch a movie today because you guys are probably sick of English right now.”  She said nothing about reading a book, she said we were going to read it in class. The sub on Friday that we had actually said “She didn’t leave me anything to do, so basically I’m your ‘free-time director’.”  Just letting you know.   Reminder: Please don't forward this to Ms. Welch, if she doesn't remember that she didnt tell us to do anything, she will definitley not be happy with me stating her faults."  It's all true.  I actually had a GOOD christian-athiest conversation with someone the other day, and- get this- they didn't hide from behind aim! That's so cool!  It was with this girl named Denebra(i think thats how its spelled), who I originally thought wasn't the smartest person, was actually able to keep up with my athiesm arguement for more than 2 seconds and flinching out with "I'm christian, i'm not comfortable about talking about that." Props to her.  I walked by these 2 girls talking yesterday, and one of them said "Well, I wanna have kids, but I don't wanna get married."  *sigh* She was mexican, too. Do you see why I want to move?
