I tried to sale to three different people and didn't close it.  I really want to quit, at the same time, I don't want to give up.  Yesterday was my birthday and I was so happy when I got home. Mimi bought me the new Jets to Brazil CD and it is just great. She bought herself the new Tori Amos and happened to pick up a limited edition copy. The packaging on this is very very cool. It came in a box with a little charm, a map, a DVD, a little accordian like paper with poloroid pics of Tori, and the CD and a little book of art stickers. Very cool.  We went to Adel's for dinner, it's like a super old Denny's style cafe. It was fun and good and the people were super nice. I slept like a rock...i was so tired from standing around doing nothing all day.   current mood:  weird current music: jets to brazil - perfecting lonliness
