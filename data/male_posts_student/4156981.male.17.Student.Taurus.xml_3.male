Well, Ill um practice at work, Im sure they wont mind, right?  Well, we just went over what to bring with Andrew, and on my bike ride this morning I was able to ponder my plan of attack for this show.  You know, outfits and stuff.  Tee hee.  Shut the fuck up.  I know you are thinking it.  Either way, I plan on enjoying myself, because the one of the only places I feel at home is up on that stage, playing my heart out.  Come see my soul tonight at Jefferson park, it will only cost 2 dollars.
