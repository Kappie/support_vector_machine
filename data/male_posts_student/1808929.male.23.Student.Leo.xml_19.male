On friday the 13th I went home to Denton to try to beat the winter weather. Early saturday morning my mother woke me up after it started to snow and I leaped from bed acting like a kid in grade school. The snow was all over the place, so with my camera in hand I went to photograph this extremely rare event. The pictures are posted at the following site:  http://photos.yahoo.com/dsegars@sbcglobal.net
