It's the sort of feeling that you get when you need something, but don't have access to it.  It's also like the feeling you have when you forgot your book at home in the middle of class.  It's right there, but there's no way for you to get it.  You know exactly where it's at, but you have no way of getting access to it.  I'm talking about the contrast in feeling when you are at school and when you are at home.  School for me, is a very weird feeling compared to time at home.  When I'm at school there's always the constant feeling where I am afraid of something that hasn't happened yet.  No matter what it is.  Maybe it's me spilling something on my shirt, or losing a contact lens.  This is only amplified in critical situations like tests and maybe during basketball.  These are all situations where you must be on top of your game.  Thoughts like this bring me to the conclusion that all my stress is based on superstitions that are caused by very small, fairly unlikely events.  Call me crazy.
