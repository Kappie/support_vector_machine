I realize that it is Father's Day tomorrow, and I am going to have to go outside today. I head for the shower. 1:23: Finish showering, brushing teeth, and putting clean clothes on. 1:31: Feed Lilly, leave house 1:38: Arrive downtown at  Antiques and Accents  1:43: Leave  Antiques and Accents  with my Father's Day present, a sort of metal cabinet thing with places to put junk. 1:43-2:01: I drive around, with no particular plan, hoping I will run into someone I know but not really in the mood to do anything. I then return home. 2:03: make Macaroni and Cheese, eat it 2:25: clean out and wash off metal cabinet, take back strut holder things off and throw them away, because they suck and detract from the aestheic quality the cabinet has 2:28-3:42: Read  Kavalier and Clay  3:42-4:40: I leave my house and head over to my mother's house for some food and stimulating conversation. My mom unsuccessfully tries to get me to attend church with her and Sam. I think about teaching Sam what I believe but decide that a few years with the Protestants will do him good. Suffering builds character, and Goats need all the character that they can get. 4:41-4:50: Drive home, singing because my tape deck is broken. 5:00-5:25: read some more  Kavalier  5:27-5:50: make yet another trip into town to water my grandma's tomato plant. I drink some hose water and it makes me feel sick. 6:05-6:38: play  Worms  6:40-8:50: Since there is nothing else to do, I get down with some serious jams on my acoustic guitar. I add  Should I Stay or Should I Go, Say Anything , and  You  to my repertoire. I also wrote songs named  One Chord Song, Two Chord Song, Three Chord Song, John is a Sellout, Techno Sucks, Go Drive Off a Bridge, If you listen to Blink-182 you must be a 13 year old girl, Country Sucks, A homeless man kicked me in the crotch (twice), I hope you get ran over by a Ford Thunderbird, Star Trek Sucks  and  I fought Adam Pelkey to the death.  Finally, I finished my crowning achievement,  A boy and his Jetpack.  Part rock opera, part emo song, part spoken word, it is bound to elicit strange new emotions in you. 8:52-9:07: more  Kavalier . 9:07-9:34: more jamming  9:36-10:40 drink hot chocolate and have serious discussion on the nature of art with Lilly. Also, I have the most brilliant thought I have ever thought on a entirely unrelated subject. 10:40-11:42 yet more  Kavalier . 11:44-11:58: shower, brush teeth 12:03-12:32: Read Sunday's  Dispatch  In all honesty, I have a few hours of activity left but I am sick of writing things down.  I have checked out Bowling for Liars before, and I know some of the claims to be untrue. Actually, I saw a whole thing about Michael Moore and websites like those on Free Speech TV. (9415 on Satellite) Anyway, I know that Michael Moore exaggerates, unfairly edits, makes claims to get attention. But that doesn't mean that he isn't right most of the time. Besides, it is nothing compared to the repeated lies by some conservatives (Ann Coulter, FOX News). The Al Franken website springs out of the neo-con's hatred of Al.   Me and John don't have to work until Tuesday, actually.  I felt the same way about Harry Potter, except for the blasphemous hand-touching of Ron and Hermoine. I almost walked out when I saw this, walked out and puked my guts out.  Obviously  Ron and Hermoine are just friends. Hermoine's got that Ruskie, and Ron gets a crush on that French girl if I remember my Potterology correctly.  Ah, the mall. Why do I hate the mall? First of all, everything there is overpriced. Second of all, the people who hang out there suck. But most importantly is because of stores like Hot Topic.   Back in my day (last summer), you got into punk through  music , not clothing. Now I wouldn't say that I dress outrageously. In fact I would say that I dress quite moderately. Yes, our clothing reflects our punkness, but we aren't punk because of how we dress. It is just us following our tradition and emulating our idols, as many types of people do. But now you have Good Charlotte or Nofx fans walking into a Hot Topic, buying some studded bracelets and some T-shirts, and calling themselves "punks." I abhor this. I hate how corporations exploit whatever is "cool" at the moment, taking everything we love and trying to peddle it to other people by suggesting that they will be more popular and credible if they wear their gear. In fact every type of person whose scene has been exploited by Hot Topic hates it. In my English class, I had a bunch of girls who would be called "goths" by people who knew less. To them, it was just the way they were. They hated a bunch of fake attention whores telling them, "Yeah, I got this at Hot Topic! I feel real sinister and stuff now!" This brings me back to my disdain for the psuedos. They get some Rancid, Casualties, and Mxpx shirts and feel like real rebels when in truth they haven't taken the time to find out what they are getting into, what the philosophy and the meaning behind the word "punk" is. I know everyone has got to start somewhere, but I didn't get into punk through wearing Nofx t-shirts, the Oselands didn't get into punk through having mohawks, Alex didn't get into punk by wearing zipper pants. We are punks because we believed those ideas before we found punk rock, we just didn't have a name for it. You can learn about punk while still keeping your self-respect and dignity.  I don't want to be told what is cool by MTV. I don't want to be my scene to be torn into easily-digestible pieces and sold in malls to unassuming kids. I don't want for the hockey players in my school to set a precendent for all the other kids to follow. I don't want to use the word "doneski" when I speak. I don't want to pass up life and experience and instead be taught by corporations how to think. I don't want to hear JT's new single. I don't want to eat at McDonalds. I don't want to learn punk from some kid at my school who thinks that he is rebelling because heard Good Charlotte sing, "I don't wanna be you." I don't want to be a part of a clique. I don't want to be assumed anti-social just because I find most of the people at my school vapid and boring.  I want to decide for myself.
