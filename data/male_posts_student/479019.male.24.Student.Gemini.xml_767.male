The Descendents fucking rule. I can't wait for their next full length to come out.  I worked out a bit today, my legs are feeling a bit wobbly from the squats. It's nice to actually do something productive for a change.  Today was a social day. Lots of talking and hanging out with friends.   Things to do tomorrow: 2 classes, pick up financial aid check, mail Netflix stuff, maybe grocery shop, and do write up.  I'm really looking forward to the upcoming week. Stuff to do! No more feeling like I'm endlessly adrift in nothingness. Hopefully the feeling of dissatisfaction will go away.   It's interesting though... my feelings are definately the result of my social conditioning. In other cultures and places where the pace of life is slower, this would be so bad for them. However, in our hyper-capitalist society productivity is important. Fuck that...   ***
