Wow it's been a long time since I've even written in this thing. I have that habit. I always start a blog and always abandon it. Anyway what have I been up to. I'll get you up to speed.  Ok. So I finally decided to do football again. Therefore I got my cleats, practice jersey, mouthguard, etc. Yeah also my mom bought me $200 of clothes from Pac Sun. We got a $100 gift card back because of some reward thing. Like $25 back for every $50 you spend. Which was cool...moving on.  I was going to go to the shore with Craig on Thursday...but alas he left earlier than expected, so I couldn't go. Instead I went to my friend Lauren's surprise birthday party at the Palace. Me and about...15-20 girls...woohoo. Some of them were decent, a few hot, a few..just plain..eww. So we bowled, ate pizza, etc. Technically I didn't eat my pizza and I was called anorexic (sp?) and then we bowled again..and then I ate something....a sundae with oreos, MMs, gummyworms, and marshmallows..mmm mmm bitch.  Oh yeah. This what I got from Pac Sun for 200 and some dollars: Independent Jeans: $50 Vans mechanic jacket: $60 Quik Silver Sweatshirt: $54 Belt: $13 BAM buckle: $20 Hacky Sack: $4  That proves...Pac Sun is a fucking expensive store..but they got kickass clothes. I went there to also get a pair of Bucky Lasek shoes but they didn't have the right color, so I order them form Vans.com, and they're coming Monday or Tuesday..I have fucking size 14 feet! Oh...here's the link to see them if you want:  urlLink http://www.progolf.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1762441   I would have gotten the Vans.com link but vans isn't loading at the moment so use that one..reatarded vans website always does this... I think that's about all that's really happened since I last wrote. Other than that I've been just sitting around, skating, sleeping. Anyway I'm going to call Alyssa or someone now so, later.
