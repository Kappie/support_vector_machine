"no, i just bought this bag, stupid"). high-fived melissa s (who yelled richard!! like a groupie lol); kat was scarfing away at a candy bar that tiffany selfishly stole with no visible remorse. we went inside, i nabbed my shirt before the line stretched to tahiti. ankur got a star on his receipt cuz he asked if the signer was a demote, but i think it's cuz she's got the hots for him. oooh yeaah.   eugene had this really long-armed monkey, he said it looked like erik...no...more like erik looks like the monkey :D doesn't abdullah terminator nezami just flow off the tongue? erik gave alex his birthday present (ps2 network adapter), kat didn't like it cuz it was oddly shaped and hard to wrap. it would be neat if we had crescent-shaped network adapters, but that's the breaks. simran spent hella money on alex. and got him a card. AND bought $200 worth of retro iverson clothes. crazy boy. broke too. devika came to wish happy birthday to her only son, even though i had to remind her. mothers these days, so forgetful. i also waved to elyse sometime but she ignored me, so i came over and gave her piece of my passive, unintimidating mind, then air-kicked (is that how you say it?) her. that's for you adam. word life. fuh. we got in a circle again (hurting our collective asses to no end) and sang old mcdonald, neil said "tree" and did some weird swaying thingy.   we got in groups and jenn WALLOPED erik with the strongest smack i've seen in many a day. boxing quality. now erik gets a hurting left arm to match alex's, haha. ran to dinner again (beat alex woot), bought anitra some food, there was about 1/3 the people compared to yesterday (er, the day before). jenn wanted to buy amita curly fries ("i know you don't eat meat, so i'll get you some chicken nuggets") but i warned amita about the dangers of fake-fingernail-infested taters of doom. needless to say she wasn't too hungry after that. my job...is complete. alex was about to ditch me so i followed and he biked away so i walked in solace and almost got run over by ira in her land rover while jaywalking (doesn't everybody?). got into our real groups, i was with whitney and devika, who are in it for the kids. all for the kids. field trips, pre-locked lockers, random condemnations, all for the kids. whitney wants to spike her hair so they will think she's cool. o the sacrifices we noble juniors must make for our country's future...  devika was woozy, but that's ok cuz her gum was spiked with e. she was shocked, shocked to hear about alex's summer liaisons. which is no big deal cuz alex was the result of her liaison. the grandparents don't know, shh. we grouped up again for stupid games. counting went nowhere cuz jenn spent hours "facilitating" our discussion when everyone else finished, so finally elyse and jen randomly yelled out 20. the name thing, we hadn't even started when they told us to sit down. we rule. we got up, belinda lost her katherine, melissa t got erik's brother ahahhaha, she thinks the short chubby blond kids are cute. someone had neha's cousin, ankur's cousin, ankur's sister?, melissa's brother, so many siblings. FOR ME TO POOP ON!! er, yeah. whitney bravely withdrew from battle early, leaving me and devika to hold the fort. samyak didn't get the e joke, or did he? surreptitious little boy. we got our names at 9:35-ish, but devika quickly snatched them with her cruel grasp of deviousnessosity.   then, homeward bound. it was pitch black, but i didn't get raped, which is good. i think. i caught queer eye for the straight guy, which is an AWESOME show. haha. i can't believe they actually allowed some of the stuff on the show to get onto network tv. like the stereotypical straight farmer-tanned bald white trashy guy talking about his stereotypical fear of stereotypical fabulous gay guys. and the chocolate finger thing. you know what i mean. i swear, that carson guy is soo like keshav. funny stuff..."he said divine? he's gayer than we are!" then a bit of conan, it was old with chris rock promoting "head of state" (which sucked bad by the way). "i make fun of everybody, but i don't talk about oprah. my mom ain't shit but don't mess with oprah! she's the richest black person on the planet. after oprah the best we have is deion sanders."  maan, cousins are cool.
