I know I will become some sort of computer dude. Right now I am leaning towards a Network Engineer.. but hey, things may change. I want to go to college at a Wisconsin State College.. preferably one that is not close to Rochester.  Maybe I'll find a girl that likes me in Wisconsin too..   I should probably stop while I'm ahead
