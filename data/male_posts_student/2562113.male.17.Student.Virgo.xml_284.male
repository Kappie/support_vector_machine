Madd at North Rockland sometimes..        cause most kids just go to parties for a place to partycause they obviously can't at home and i see how it works everyone asks everyone if they heard something and then everyone calls everyone and everyone shows up at some house it's scumbag        What's great about Albany is that EVERYONE has a place to drink.. the people who chill with me on the weekends aren't with me cause i'm giving them a place to drink.. they're there cause they're my real friends.. who are drunk and merry..         So.. everyone who wants a place to drink Sat Aug 28 8pm 1400 Washington Ave Albany NY State Fulton 306 is where one of the craziest fucking shits will ever go down.    Everyone is invited.. but i know that only my true bros and girls will show up..
