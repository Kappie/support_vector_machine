Anywho, stefan and i show up and then like i didnt plan on swimming, but i wanted to so i jump in with my jeans on and it's kickass.  so yeah, pool with jeans, like the're were like slushies and food yay.  yeah, there was a trampoline it was cool.  i cant do a flip, and i got accidentally elbowed in the pills and it still kinda hurts. right before we left too.  oh well, the party was awesome  and tomorrow - rowena's graduation.
