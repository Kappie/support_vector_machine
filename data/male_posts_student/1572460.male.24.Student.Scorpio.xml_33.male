Kya weather hai sir..." , I say to Vaibhav, affectionately called "Sir" in the 21C household, as I pack my backpack.  Sir  probably does not hear me, either because he's happily dozing off, or because he chooses to ignore my words -- he's entitled to feel tired of me saying this with every passing day of the summer. Moreover, after all, the nocturnal being that he is, he hardly gets to experience any proper daylight. No worries, Sir.  It's 5:30 pm and off we head into rocky mountain high...  Mike spends a few minutes briefing us on the topic of  'Rafting for dummies' . His cheerful persona along with occasional friendly banter makes him an ideal person to lead outdoor trips like rafting and hiking. Plus, he makes things look very easy. Rafting, in hindsight, doesn't seem too much complicated. Rather, to me, it doesn't seem like a sport which you could discuss and dissect at length. But Mike shares with us lots of inside stuff, every nuance of information he can think of. We are enlightened, ofcourse. I am impressed, because I admire people who can talk and make you listen without batting an eyelid, especially on topics that don't exactly appear to be engaging.    Session I:   Here we go. The raft is all set. Life jackets and helmets are on. Milind and Sameer get ready to hop onto the raft. They take the first strike along with Mike. Meanwhile, Snehal and I drive down to Picnic Rock, the point where the three would be meeting us after paddling downstream. It's the first time I drive a SUV. Not good, because the acceleration was sticky and heavy. Not bad for going a couple of miles. I begin to wonder how  anybody  can be comfortable driving that car for more than a few miles. I am not the only one feeling arthritic -- later on Milind would feel the same.   After exactly 45 minutes, Milind and Sameer and Mike arrive on the banks of Picnic Rock. The guys are shivering to their bones, but all smiles nevertheless. Round 1 went well as expected.    Session II:   Yours truly, Snehal and Mike hop in. Snehal in the front (confused yet paddling with gusto), me in the center (awe-struck by how a simple little raft couching three men, on gushing and rapidly flowing white water could actually float without flipping), and Mike in the rear (our navigator, also paddling). Two minutes into the river, and an approaching,  seemingly harmless wave of cold water slaps my body from the right side, blinding me for a second.  "Wow, that was awesome!" , I remark, even as I frantically try to check whether I am still on the raft.  "What happened?" , asks Snehal. Mike chuckles, as he realizes that Snehal wasn't too lucky to experience the wave-splashing. Shivering starts to set in...which later on, we would realize, wouldn't stop until we reached the warm confines of our home. The water is COLD. Snehal is doing a good job of paddling, for a novice, and gets some words of encouragment from Mike. Mike quips,  "Do you guys want to take the adventurous route, or the safer one?".  Adventure being the name of the game, Snehal and I aren't the least bit hesitant. As we cut through the waters, it doesn't take us long to hit a big rock in the middle of the river. We are stuck, and our efforts of leaning the raft on the side of the rock and trying to force it to move, prove fruitless. Not really a dreadful situation, but plenty of adrenalin-pumping action. Then, much to our disbelief, Mike hops out of the raft, onto the rock, and skillfully lifts one end of the raft to usher it back in the water. Naturally, and as expected, the raft begins to move rather quickly with the downstream flow, but Mike is alert enough to literally jump in the air from his position on the rock, across onto the raft, at the very instant the raft is about to take off downstream. Enthralling experience! Straight out of the movies. I wish somebody's there to film us. Thanks to Mike, because he keeps his nerves all right.  Snehal and I switch positions. I take over the cockpit and the paddle, and Snehal's in control of the other one. We do well. Mike adds,  "You guys should form a team or something, you appear to have jolly good instincts".  Although we continue to have our moments of understeer and oversteer, both of us quickly manage to get the hang of it, and correct our strokes. Never imagined rafting could be so exhausting -- its a terrific cardio exercise -- no wonder you see rowing machines in the gyms in this part of the world. The strange part is, the legs get more sore than the hands/shoulders, which happen to do most of the work. The butt too bears the brunt of the relentless rocky waters. Nothing agonizing though. Our journey continues through some magical points along the river, such as  'Mad Dog'  and  'Rock Garden' , and we especially enjoy subtly manoeuvring through the eddy currents. We are nearing the end of our stint, and are about 100 feet away from the Picnic Rock banks, when suddenly, out of nowhere, Mike who is sitting at the rear end, spills out of the raft, into the water. Nobody, including Mike himself, knows how he managed to do that. Time for some bursts of laughter. Fortunately, Mike grabs a rock and quickly stands tall on it. The water is not too rapid at this point, and although Snehal and I are stuck in the middle of the river on our own, we manage to steer the raft to safety. Another memorable moment to add to the eventful journey.  We are back inside Mike's Chevrolet reliving the moments.  "Country roads, take me home..." . Come home, we do. Tired limbs, and some much needed hot caffeine. There is perhaps nothing better to end a long day with some fine dining at IHOP. And so we did....  Anybody for a better  Wednesday ?!
