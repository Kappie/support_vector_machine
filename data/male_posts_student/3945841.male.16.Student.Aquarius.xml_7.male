F**k susanna man.. i didn't know she was a playa.. man.. i don't feel depressed or sad like zelong! but i can't take this sitting down.. i've been made a cuckold by this fucking brainless no-brainer. i can't fucking take it. sorry for the uncensored vulgarities. i just can't take the anger that's fucking boiling inside my fucking HEART. haha. fuck you susanna. i hate you.. don't you know that? i didn't know you cheated me the first time round.. pals around me dropped fucking    HEAVY FUCKING HINTS.   MAN.! this suck. i gotta learn to wash my hands clean off that shithole of a bitch. i just can't fucking take it. HAHA! what an appropriate music i'm playing in the computer background right now! its "you don't miss your water till the water runs dry". am i suppose to let this matter go? or should i make it difficult for susanna? i'm not the kind who'd break up a happy home.haha..she was on and off with this guy namely melvin. who's somewhat or rather related to Yuki. susanna told me that her relationship with melvin was purely plutonic. and it has always been. yesterday she told me so.. till TODAY! man. fucking hell! i'm freakin pissed. what am i supposed to do. her mother asked me to change her for the better...implying that she was better behaved when she was with me!! heh...OHBEHAVE!!!! haha.. *grins*(at last) can afford to smile.  sigh.. it must be retribution that i must be getting all this shit back at me.. well.. man.. i need a good fuck right now.. not as if i've fucked before. just an expression!    i'll just end here before i end up smashing my computer!! FUCK YOU!!! FUCK YOU!!!!
