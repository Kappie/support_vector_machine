You must've all considered yourselves pretty lucky, not seeing me show up around here for a while. Well your little break's over, time to suffer again.  Looks like there are quite a few wholly inane problems that you people seem to be bothered with...well then let's see...  That's right, no one likes that english class, but you all took it, oh well.   Yes, that's right, physics and calculus are equally confusing, and it sucks if you take both classes at once, and u use the same calculator. You have to keep switching between radians for cal and degrees for physics, and if you forget to during a test, sucks to be you.   Yeah, parents do suck, if you've got weird parents, just ignore them or something. In your case you could have just said out loud, "Why are you still here?!" and pushed her out the door or window, your choice.  Now that's all for you.  Friday was crap, the week before was kind of like crap, yesterday was like crap, today is going to be crap, crap just can't stop happening, oh my goodness there is so much crap.  I'm Deadinside, and that's a lot of crap.  "Starting with me, everything in this place is mean and miserable."
