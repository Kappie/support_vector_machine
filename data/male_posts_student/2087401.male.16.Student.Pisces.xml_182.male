The one I ordered from Amazon three times, that I first ordered at the beginning of September?  Well, guess what they just sent me?  The vocal libretto book.  Apparently I accidently ordered that instead last time I reordered the CD.  ERRRRRRRRRR!  God's Bread it makes me mad!  My fingers itch! Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?
