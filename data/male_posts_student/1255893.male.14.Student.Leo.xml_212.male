Once there, I showered up, cleaned house (literally), and chilled for a while. Around 1, the air was blowing really pretty-ly, so I walked over to my mommy's bed 'cause it's right next to the window. I napped till 4 =P. At 4:30, Mom and I were out the door again, ready to take advantage of the sexy zephyr-like winds. Jebus Christ, it felt great. Now I'm here, sitting at my computer, listening to Linkin Park, hangin out. Feelin good =D.
