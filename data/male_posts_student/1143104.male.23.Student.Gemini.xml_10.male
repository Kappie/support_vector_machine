The womenfolk love surprises because...well, for a few reasons. First, it shows that you are thinking just a little outside the box. You care enough about her to take time out of your life (at least you've convinced her by now that you have one), and are willing to spend it with her. But they also like surprises because that means more time with you. You should want to spend a little extra time with your girl because she probably wants to spend it with you. But remember, don't try and surprise her in the middle of her work day when she has about 1,000 things to do and her boss is breathing down her neck. She'll think its "cute but stupid". Do it when you know she's not particularly busy or maybe a little sad or upset. A nice comforting hug can be the best thing in the world.
