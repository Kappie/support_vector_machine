Jus celebrated XY birthday on Wednesday, not bad lol.......we bought her lingerie, my idea, stella chose it lol........she laughed when she opened it. Play PS play like siao.........then eat also eat like siao, my hair also cut on that day, go QB cut, they all there damn pro, not say cut until damn nice, but the technique is sui man.......I've been following the malaysian elections pretty closely and BN must win. I hate PAS man, those religious bigots. RELIGION AND SOCIETY CANNOT MIX !!!! AND MUST NOT MIX, ANY GOVERNMENT INFLUENCED BY RELIGION SHOULD BE IMPEACHED, I HATE THEOCRAIES !!!!!!! Religion should be segregated from society and politics, religion should be separate, and in short, religion should mind its own business.   And that includes George Bush, a christian bigot imo. Real conservative idiot, I think he invaded Iraq to crush the jewel of the arab world, Baghdad, to prove that Islam is weaker, inferior blah blah blah. And he trying to go beyond his powers to stop gay marraiges, totally unconstitutional....!! Even though I'm against gay marraiges, he has no right to intervene with state policy. NO RIGHT !!! THERE"S NO SUCH THING IN POLITICS AS GOD SAY IT IS SO SO IT IS SO ! no such thing. I want Kerry to win, why? cos' i hate bush, the way he talks.......oh man......he would be better off as a pastor than a president. Ohhh i see a vision of a free Iraq........shut up, yeah u see a free Iraq but at what cost? the lives of US soldiers, the lives of the Iraqis, its like using religion to grope your way around this world, what a pathetic attempt. He's dumb, the way he talks, oh man, a real politician i would say, all talk, no walk. Look at SM Lee, he has much more insight than that guy........MUCH MORE !  I hate people who impose their religion on others who don't accept them. I hate people who think that their religion is the only right way to go. What close-minded bigots. I don't hate religion but i hate the religious. POLITICS MUST REMAIN SECULAR !!!! TOTALLY SECULAR !!! Religion should always be a subset of a community. That's me following elections too closely, but these are my beliefs. SUPPORT BARISAN NASIONAL, VOTE FOR KERRY !  Imo, PAS are dumbasses, so what if you've won a johor seat by default? what does that prove? NOTHING ! maybe your luck, but that's all. Johor really has no place for bigots like you. But I think BN has more chance of winning this election, PAS, imo, would probably fade into oblivion if the BN is lucky. But otherwise, BN has more chance of taking back some territories, Terengganu hopefully, and maybe kelantan. and maybe the BN were a slumbering, corrupted bunch during the 1999 elections, but with Abdullah now on the helm, things seem to be much better, esp. with his promises to rid UMNO of corruption, which the people view as the no. 1 problem in Malaysian politics. But imo, the reason why PAS swept the country was because of firstly, BN's inefficeincy and also, Religious rethoric and fervour was used to a great extent. It was basically a try-and-see move for most PAS voters during 1999 imo. But now, PAS promise this and that this and that, but can they deliver? Well, aside from verses from the Quran.........NO !!!! they can't, they're virtually broke, and need federal help to get their states going. Besides, with Abdullah more focused on Islam now,esp. Islam hadhari, its difficult for PAS to retain its ground imo. But you gotta admit, the barisan alternatif has some pretty tough nuts in there, Haron Din, Wan Azizah Ismail, Hadi Awang, these are people imo, who would probably be the lifeline of the BA.  Ok, since I've not updated my blog for a long time, the next post shall talk about my week.
