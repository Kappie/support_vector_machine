At Microsoft, theory and practice are united: nothing works and nobody knows why."  -- Anonymous  Recently, I happened to globe totter on the WWW on the history of computing in general. Thanks to my high school, my first introduction to a computer was in the form of a ZX Spectrum. It was one of those really pivotal machines in introducing ordinary people to home computing (in school). Spectrums featured a coloured display, an easy to learn yet versatile built-in BASIC and they also quite possibly served as low cost educational and productivity tools. In fact an entire generation of programmers wrote their first lines of code on those rubber keys -- and for a few years the machines also served as the #1 gaming consoles. Its all nostalgia when I take a trip down memory lane and recall the early years of working (read: gaming) on my first home PC. Thanks to my dad, it was an Intel 286 powered by an 8MB RAM chip and equipped with Quantum's 40MB disk running Microsoft's Disk Operating System (DOS), the coolest OS to hit the market then. Believe it or not, this mean little machine played host to hundreds of DOS-based games.  Microsoft. DOS. All too familiar names. Bill Gates was just on the way towards his glory days then, soon to be the most revered software techie the world had ever seen and the man behind the empire called Microsoft, which today, is clearly struggling to live upto its name. Hardcore MS detractors or Open Source software protagonists, whichever way one would like to put it, would say that MS never deserved to bask in glory, so there was never a question of living upto its name - it was only a hype in an industry on the verge of bursting open. Gates was quite clearly the single biggest role model for every kid who wrote source code during that time. The God of all tech nerds, I even remember myself going gaga all over when I was told that I shared my birthdate with Gates. An avid gamer and a software tweaker (if not exactly a coder) during those days, I could have hardly hoped for a better person to share my birthday with.  Microsoft reached its popularity pinnacle after it released its Windows OSes, specifically its 3.x and 9x versions. To a larger extent, MS became a monopoly on the lines of other companies like AT After coming up with NT, 2000 and the latest XP versions, nobody would deny the fact that the world still loves MS, but at the same time there are people out there who would leave no stone unturned when displaying their hatred towards the software giant. In essence, and as I see it, the common man has very much a love-hate relationship with MS.  On the other hand, Microsoft is being subject to intense hostility and animosity the world over, not only in the form of  urlLink legal lawsuits  by competitive companies in the software market, but also in the form of day-to-day  urlLink humor and ridicule . Upon taking a closer look, on a much more wider - political, industrial and technological scale and perspective, the issues with Microsoft and its competitors, namely Netscape/AOL and Sun Microsystems, seem to be more clandestine than they actually appear. There are still egos to settle and plenty of naysayers out there on both sides of the court.  The problem with Micrsoft is three-fold, and on different levels, making it the bad boy of software today. The three issues pretty much border around each other but it makes sense to apply some form of distinction so as to discuss them individually. Three questions arise.  (I discuss one question here and the remaining two in Part II of this blog, in order to achieve some semblance of brevity in my writings).     Why is Windoze believed to be just another pane in the glass? Does Microsoft really produce software that meets the user's expectations?    >>  Whether Windoze is just another pane or a tougher glass shield, is more of a technical issue dealing with the core design of the OS, rather than something that any naive user can comment on. But I have to admit this. The degree to which Microsoft and Windows have lowered my as well as fellow users' expectations are baffling. Why then - after more than a decade churning out one OS after another - Microsoft fails to embed a simple virus scanner into its OS is absolutely beyond me. Outlook Express, the Windoze based email client and the most effective breeding ground to-date for all worms and trojans floating around in cyberspace, just does not seem to improve. Now you know, why someone talked about theory and practice at Microsoft. Moreover, forget virus scanners. If Microsoft cannot find the cure, how can it possibly prevent any subsequent anomalies? Why does every new Microsoft OS have the biggest security loop-hole, forcing users to download patches after patches, time after time, only to find that by the time they are trying to get to terms with the OS and possibly get some fair share of their value for money and time, in comes another new release touted to be the next revolutionary thing to have hit them? This is followed by numerous version compatibility problems with files and documents. Furthermore, failure and recovery remain some of the issues that are still dealt rather sloppily - a classic example being Microsoft Word. To top it all, products come with a not-so-cheap price tag. Are customers paying  exclusively  for the robust, reliable software product? I don't believe so. They are almost compelled to pre-pay, in advance, for future  customer service , in the form of countless patches that the company sends out, only to label them as  free downloads . The common man doesn't complain much. Microsoft and Windows have had such a huge impact on the home/desktop PC market, that nobody gives a damn. After all, why would someone bother about robustness and reliability if the only thing one does is play games, browse the web and listen to music? Fair enough. Let the worms wriggle inside, who cares? People have no problem downloading frequent patches and updates. And then luckily for Microsoft, not every user plays with Word documents everyday, in order to get a chance of standing testimony to the fact that data loss is a common phenomenon under the hood of this system.   The truth is, Microsoft gets away with buggy software on enough occasions to actually ride on that wave and be successful. Perhaps, on a more positive note to make MS fans happy, I can transpose the earlier statement and say that it manages to do just enough for them to make them happy!   (Part II continued  urlLink here ...)
