I must be affecting him in some way. It's at  urlLink http://discombobulatingthoughts.blogspot.com/ . Next on my list will be Jon, who has just managed to fix his computer (kind of) and knows nothing of the blogger world. Eventually we will have enough people to make a group blog, for no good reason :). Tomorrow-wise is looking hazy, has there are only 5 people going. I have decided to ring Tim and ask him to come, although this may result in an age-old battle between him and James, who were originally friends (don't ask), but who now would happy slaughter the other one, his family, pets and nieghbours if given the chance. They survive unintentional social meetings by being icily, chillingly police to each other when talking, and ignoring each other for the rest of the time. Never mind, it will bring a smile to their faces when they realise that they are in close proximty to each other while holding guns, even if they only shoot water. Well that's it for now, I'm about to test a game called gunbound, which has been recommended to me. I'll let you know what it's like in my next post, if my rubbish compter will even let it work. Byeeeeeeeeeee.
