They have mini-golf, a recroom, and go-cart-racing. Okay, lemme get back to the party. We did EVERYTHING! The best activity was the go-cart-racing. The go-carts go 20 to 24 m.p.h. and the course has lots of sharp turns. Man, the whole time I was go-carting, I was just gunning it! We probably raced for 15 minutes, but after 10 minutes this dumb-ass-chick was turning and I was right behind her going FAST . . . real fast! As she turned she came to a total stop and I rammed right into her. The rules say not to bump into other drivers. After that an employee came to me and blamed me for running into her. Come on!!! It's her fault. She's the moron!, not me!  Other than that, my friend and I had a great time. I'm definitely coming back!
