I had a rough week at work and was wondering how I was going to get through it but then I found (and heard) a couple of great verses about not worrying about men and worrying more about GOD. Doesn't matter so much what men think of me but it'd better matter to me what God's opinion is! I still need to fine tune the older songs and write some brand new ones down somewhere. I wanna talk about PEACE and REST in God. I feel at peace when I'm with him.. so true. I'm really tired from all the work too so I could always use a good rest.. no doubt. OO.. no doubt,.. if only it wasn't already a band name.. it could make the basis of a good song. Well I'm going to go post on johnsois1 now so I'll ttyl.. k?k? bye
