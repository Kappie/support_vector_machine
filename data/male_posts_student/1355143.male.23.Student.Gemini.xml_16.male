I went over to a friend's flat tonight and proceeded to show them pictures from Barcelona for about 2 hours. Needless to say, they got really tired of it after a while (they didn't know all the cool people after all). I thoroughly enjoyed Vegard's new pics though. Well done, China Boy. Don't get SARS. Heard it's dangerous or something like that. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the pics of me in Adam's "European" shirt from the night we went to Chupito's and Costa Breve. I couldn't find the pic of my shoes though...wonder why? ;)  Ulli, I'm glad you've given us such a lesson about music. I'm sure I'll appreciate it when I'm sober...whenever that may be. Svala is gorgeous by the way, so if her brother is anything near as hot, the band will be at least worth checking out (especially for Lee and Rodney). I watched "Queer Eye For the Straight Guy" the other day, this relatively new American show about 5 or so gay guys rearranging a straight guy's life. It's pretty fucking hilarious. They re-decorate his home, teach him how to cook, get him new clothes, teach him how to groom himself, etc. I didn't think I would like it, but it's really cool. Maybe it'll hit Europe soon, if we didn't copy it from Europe in the first place. Wouldn't surprise me since Europe seems to be much more liberal on issues concerning homosexuality. I'm just hoping I remember in the morning what exactly I typed tonight. I have to be up in like 6 hours to drive my girlfriend to work, but yet it feels like an early morning by BCN standards. I mean, it's barely 2 o'clock and I'm ready for bed. I'd probably be in bed if I hadn't gotten the idea to type this stupid blog. I feel a mad case of the munchies developing here. Time to go get something to eat. Drunk food here is so much better than Bar Paris. Thank goodness I don't have to eat those shitty, cold eggs on a bap anymore. But I've wasted enough of your lives. Goodnight one and all.  Tim
