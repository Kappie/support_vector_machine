The idea was originally my parent's, but I guess it grew on me after the months went by. So tomorrow I have to go at 1pm and sit and talk to with counselor's at Schley. Schley is supposed to be a good school but I just have too many friends to leave behind. I would and could still see them, but not as often as I'd like to.       I just farted.      Anyways, tomorrow I will take what happens until 1 at ASS (Americus-Sumter School for you non-knowers) and then take how much I liked Schley, and deliberate. These next two years are important and I really want to get everything out of high school I hand for college. I just hope their Technology Labs are actually up-to-date.
