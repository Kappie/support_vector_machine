It was friday night, and Simon and I had decided to go out, he had been invited to a Jesus Freak party. and I had been invited to Bennet's 18th. We decided to go to both. We went to the Jesus party first. I find these sort of events uncomfortable, because I'm not one of *them* I don't believe in a ressurection, nor do i believe in the idea of a son of god; basically i don't believe in the 2 cornerstones of the Christian faith. And I go to a party where there is nothing but *them*! If only they knew... See, when they find out that you don't see the world the way they do, they ask why and you have to explain it, and then they try and pickapart your logic which is fine, if there is one or two, but not when there are 20 of them! The best part is they sincerly wish to find out what you think and when they do, they pity you. They call you "Lost!" (Their insufferable self-absorbtion!) I play very defensively to stop this sort of thing from happening and Simon very rarely steps in to help. They ultimately sense something about me, my difference. fat we just have conflicting beliefs but conflicting attitudes.   Anyway, We were only there for a couple of hours. We went off to bennets party, where simon was uncomforatble. Ok, so there was a fair bit of pot but come on. On our way back we stopped off at Mully's where the gang was getting drunk, we watched futurama till 2 am. That was a good friday night. I need all my friday nights like that.
