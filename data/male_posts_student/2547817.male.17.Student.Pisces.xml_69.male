A tune simply popped into my head after talking to Sunshine Sarah. But the tune's happy and the song's 'bout the world spitting on your face. Juxtaposition. Oxymoron.  Enjoy random lyrics.  I'm in the sky tonight There I can keep by your side Watching the wide world ride and hide now I'll be coming home next year.  Into the sun we climb Climbing our wings will burn white Everyone's strapped in tight we'll ride it out. I'll be coming home next year.
