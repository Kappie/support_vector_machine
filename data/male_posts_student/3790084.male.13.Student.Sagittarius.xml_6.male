We always make mistakes by not realize how lucky we are... We always miss the chance we have by being so selfish to ourself... We always never realize when people are good to us until they walk out from the door our heart.. no longer turning back to us... By that time, we only started to realize how important the person in our life... but everything is already a past tense... The worse part is; whenever we started to being so dependent on that person.. Heart pain is even painful than heart attacting whenever he/ she no longer stand by our sides...
