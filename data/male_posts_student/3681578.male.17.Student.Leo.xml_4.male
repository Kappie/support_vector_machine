I'm starting to hate Fil all over again...mainly because I don't like panitikang pinoy...those ugly poems, boring stories, dull plays does not ensnare me and my reading senses whenever I read this...like many others who hate Fil...I just say that it is a big lump of useless words...  Another thing about me hating Fil is because of our Fil teacher in high school who bored the hell out of us whenever her period is up...we actually call her HAMAKA, from the title of the book she wrote and she is proud of...actually, its not even nice...being a Fil textbook and all...anyway, she was sooooo boring...sobra, to the max...with her stupid routines like..."o, magpangkatan na kayo" and "Tayo nang maglagom, bumuo tayo ng sintesis batay sa mga ulat ninyo"...when she gets angry she can go like, "Wag niyo akong subukan ha, magpapasensyahan na lang tayo" (Our section was IV-Patience) and "Hindi porket kabisado niyo na ang Pisiks Wan, ang Kemistri..." (She was referring to me...being the science wiz of the class and all...but tell you what, I haven't memorized Pisiks Wan and Kemistri up to date...)  And I still remember me sucking at her recitation about that damned El Fili, she was ranting on like, "O, batay sa teksto...Ano ang nilalaman ng telegrama sa wakas ng kwento?"...shucks, patay-patay na...most (if not all) of our class haven't read the thing...i was like nanghuhula na lang...and it was totally a fiasco even though me seatmates were coaching me with whispers...no one just seemed to know the answer...  Up to now, the content of that "telegrama" is still unknown to me...just like the fact that Pisiks Wan and Kemistri can be memorized...hehehe...  My English and Lit classes are next na so...this will be the end...  :-)
