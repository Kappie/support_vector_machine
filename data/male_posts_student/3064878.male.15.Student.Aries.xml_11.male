I was showing them and my mom how to play a game... and my brother was cracking jokes every ten seconds... Me: That is called a sandwhich... Him: Rye or wheat bread with ham!  Me: Fuck You Branden!  Dad: WTF did you just say!  Me: BLAH BLAH BLAH Then I came to the computer... only to find out that I need a new graphics card and that my cd drive doesn't work anymore...
