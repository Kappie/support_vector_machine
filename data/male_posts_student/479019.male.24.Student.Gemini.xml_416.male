Then I missed the bus home, so I had to hike 3 miles home. It was a good workout at least... carrying... um... 20 lbs of groceries? It was 1 carton of juice, 1 2 liter of soda, 1 small thing of laundry detergent, eggs, bread, limes, tomato, chicken, and hashbrowns. So yea... the weight of the fluids really added up.  I did some fiddling with my papers, but nothing substantial. I simply feel lazy today. I slept for a couple hours after my hike. Then made the key lime pie. Then got pissed off at my drive kit some more. Oh! and no netflix movies today!   Fucking it wasn't a good day.  **
