I feel like I don't know what to do or say or act because of what my parents would say or do.  I HATE IT  I am NOW in the "phase" of not giving a shit about what anyone says,thinks about what/who I am or what I do. It really is making me mad at the moment. PLUS when i dont care about what anyone says or thinks they/he/she says what the hell is wrong with you? or they get mad right back at me for saying and doing what I feel like doing. Right noone I think only a couple people understand what I am going through right now and I thank them. If you're thinking they're my parents you are the most opposite of right you could ever be.
