It makes me wonder who looks at weblogs.  The overwhelming theme of each entry is something like this: "Sorry I haven't posted in so long."  The weird thing is that I see myself doing the same thing.  After just searching for "definition of a weblog" I came across  urlLink this  essay.  After reading that and surfing to many of the linked sites in the essay, I went in to what I like to call (or just came up with now) the 'mood of awareness' where I realize that the world I live in is truly huge!  Another site I would like to mention is the wonderful  urlLink OurDocuments  government site.  This site has 100 of the most influential documents in the history of the United States.  Just browsing this site was a treat.  Highly recommended if you're as bored as I was when I found it.  Hah.
