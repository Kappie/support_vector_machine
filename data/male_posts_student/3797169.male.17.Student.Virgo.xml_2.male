People that don't give a shit about the superficial dogcrap, who hang out with you when you're down, who talk to you when you feel like shit.      Peopl like Cam, Nar, Son, Noelle, Lee, Malcolm, Phillips, and all the others that aren't just playin' around when they ask you how you're doin.      I suppose I should explain how they earned their name...It's probably because every time I would talk to someone, we'd be discussing who would come here or go there, and we would say, not all the shitty people and the assholes, just "the Rest..."      The Rest of the world. The non- shallow, arrogant, dumbfuck, conceeded, heartless people of the world. The people that really make a difference.      I may not be a very smart man, and I may not be very good with words, but I do know I would rather have the support of one true friend than the support of thousands of fakes.      This is for Cam...thanks.
