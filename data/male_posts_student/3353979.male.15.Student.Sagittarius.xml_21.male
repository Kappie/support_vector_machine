The place that is home dosent feel like home anymore,, i feel traped in this place, today i walked around and this place donsent feel like home it feels more like a prision....... i cant stand living here anymore,, the people here sometimes make it worse they dont know who i am, im full of secrets... i think there is only one person here who can understand me but im still to afraid to open up and reveal the true me, i know that if i open up i will be alot happier and feel alot better but i just dont know if im ready..........
