I am truly surprised when she asked me this personal question when we were the only 2 in the lab.  The girl: "Xing Yi, do you have girlfriend?" Me: "Don't have..." The girl: "Why don't have, why don't you go find one?"  Then when I am going to reply, a voice burst out of a sudden from those guys coming into the lab. On that day, I sense something is quite amiss, because she is like trying to be close to me and somehow being sweet too. I can feel that the way she treat me and the others were totally different, I always have this kind of suspicious feeling whenever she talks to me.  No matter what, I am quite happy though if someone likes me, but how am I going to rejert her if one day she expressed her love towards me? Sometimes, I am contradict. I would like people to like me, but yet I can't allow myself belong to people.  I am not sure whether if this girl has a liking on me.... but I have listed down a few reasons that she might be.  1) She ask me this personal question out of a sudden when we are not even close friend or we are not having a conversation.  2) She treat me extremely different from the rest.  3) She find opportunity to get close to me. (I can tell that)  Therefore, there is a 50% chance of her has taken a liking on me.  I shall not dwell on this anymore, exam is coming. I should concentrate on my studies first and finish whatever unfinished work.  And 1 Melanie is enough to disrupt my life, I hope there's no more addition to it. But I think this girl is far much more better than Melanie because she's much more gentle and refine. Not like Melanie, so rough and so vulgar. Hahaha....
