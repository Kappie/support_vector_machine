Or am I goin' down? 'Cause everyday I'm here All I feel is sheer Agony  Friends tellin' me that maybe I need Some psychiatric help Yeah, they're always so quick to tell you Just how to get on with it I look into the mirror And all I see is age, fear And agony  If I could just remember what is was like When I was younger Before all the joy and happiness Was replaced with hunger Now all I've got to show For the seeds that didn't grow Is agony  ......................................  Lone Wolf:  I am a lone wolf I always was and will be I feel fine, I am resigned to this I am a lone wolf I am a lone wolf  Got my cares Wrapped up all nice and neat In my suitcase I'll take it down the street To a place with plenty of space for me I am a lone wolf  I am a lone wolf It blows my mind That people wanna try to get inside my tired head I am a lone wolf I am a lone wolf  I am a lone wolf Nobody needs to get too close to me You'll only see this truth I am a lone wolf
