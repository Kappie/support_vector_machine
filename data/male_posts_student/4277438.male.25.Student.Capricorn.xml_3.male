I don't know whether that's because I've bored myself silly with it, or whether I just have a short attention span. Anyway, I thought I'd start off with that universal topic of conversation - the weather. I live in Wellington, New Zealand and the weather this week has been  urlLink crap . The flat suffered a power cut on Tuesday night due to a lightening strike and it was impossible to drive into town - fortunately I had no seminars scheduled at varsity. But I'm glad I don't live in  urlLink Florida  or in  urlLink Boscastle , England. At least they're having good weather in Athens, although the place does seem a bit  urlLink smoggy  from what I saw watching the rowing the other day. Since New Zealand has yet to win a single medal at the Olympics this year, I'm prepared to blame it on the pollution.
