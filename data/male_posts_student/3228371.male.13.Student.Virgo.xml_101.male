THEN I took a shower.  Called Nima but he wasn't home. His mom answered and again recognized my voice (or it could always be Caller ID) so yeah. Told me he was at Jordan's so I called his cell. Blah.   I'm so hungry... haven't eaten anything since 12. Had a chocolate bar around 1:30, and a small bag of snack noodles at 6 but that was it... still haven't had dinner. The only thing I had for breakfast was Shepherd's Pie and I had a few Chinese Pork Buns for lunch. I'm so freakin hungry... and tired... and sleepy.   I burnt a piece of paper in my washroom! LOL! 'Cos there's no carpet in the washroom and the floor's tiled (duh) so I wouldn't set the house on fire. Blah.  My fingers are SO FUCKED UP from golfing! Skinned 2 fingers, which now STING from contact with ANYTHING except for air, and got a callus on another. Golfing's worth it though... I guess. I might join the golf team in BSS and meet more golfers and I'll TRY OUT for basketball (although I won't make it since it's more like a popularity contest) and I'll TRY OUT for volleyball. *sighzZ*   Talking to Park on MSN again... Nobody else to talk to! Ahh! So bored. Will came online but he's busy so yeah. I'll see him tomorrow.   Oooh that reminds me... church tomorrow. Hm, I feel like dressing a little more like ME... probably a t-shirt, jeans, and... my cowboy hat? Iunno if it's appropriate for church though... maybe I'll wear it to Bethel next time. Maybe. Dunno. Whatever. Haha! I can't ruin my hair tomorrow though. Wait, I gotta wash it with extra stuff to make it extra nice for grad.  Ahhh! Thinking about all that work is making me HUNGRY! Screw it whatever. Hehe! I'm off for now...
