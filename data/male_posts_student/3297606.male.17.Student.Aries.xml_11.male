The blogs now have strength beyond what they did before, with the power of the triforce, they are indestructible. What army can stand up against Tyler Mike and Thomas? NONE!  i had to refer to zelda.com to remember the name of the triforce.  [img]http://www.celes-chere.net/zelda/nes/11.jpg[/img]  ^^^ does it work? ^^^  NO IT DOESNT! Ill leave it there for +10 sympathy points...  So we are going to the beach after school today, i cant wait. School is so boring now. I chronically bite my teachers, and the consequences are beginning to surmount! (note: surmount does not mean get bigger) (note2: YES IT DOES!).  so im in history today... but Mr. Williamson is teaching in another classroom (WHY? who knows!? maybe Tyler does!). So we have the wonderful Mrs. Grecko. right now she is on Mr. Williamson's computadora looking at american idol stuff. I hate that show!  no i dont...  American Idol is not my show, but i dont hate it. I have to admit it is a better idea than most of these other stupid reality shows that are coming out. They get worse by the day. Survivor has yet to be beaten. If i made a reality show, it would be called "Parch Ghill Arch III - X." In my reality show, instead of stupid fat people winning record contracts, or gay naked people winning a million dollars for having someone tape his inconvinience on a mound of sand... i would have a game where there are 10 people chosen at random, and brought to a boat in the middle of the ocean. They would all be expecting to be lead to some tropical island! but no! The captain of the boat and staff of teh show would kill themselves, or just jump into the ocean! this would leave the 10 people stranded on a boat with no food or drinkable water! (la captain would dispose of all food and drinkable water right before suicide). We could have cameras set up around the boat, and watch as they turn to cannibalism and become dehidrated drom drinking salt water! Whoever is living last would get a big round of applause, and the money to pay for the boat would be taken out of his account.   that would be a show worth watching...  Jon Vevoda - when you think of hardcore you think of Jon Vevoda. He could kill one million oversized quail in the snap of a finger crought. Has his own realm of awsomeness, and in this realm lies really big axes and explosives.  current equation: H2O + CO2 = EXPLODE current taste in mouth: bitter
