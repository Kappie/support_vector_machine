A movie camera is like having someone you have a crush on watching you from afar  -- you pretend it's not there. I don't think there's a punch-line scheduled, is there? I just stopped playing bitches on wheels and peoples' mothers. I have only a few more years to kick up my heels! Even the best of friends cannot attend each other's funeral. He enjoys much who is thankful for little. Live always in the best company when you read. We all have ability. The difference is how we use it. Leap, and the net will appear. To advise is not to compel. Surgeons must be very careful. When they take the knife!, underneath their fine incisions, stirs the Culprit -- Life! He who can take advice is sometimes superior to him who can give it.
