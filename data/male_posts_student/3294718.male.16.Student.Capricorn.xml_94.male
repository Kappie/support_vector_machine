They have been around for 6-7 years now, but they still grab your imagination and make you want to play even all these years later. Even though the game is repetetive, and the story isn't even that great, you still quest with your whole heart to catch em' all. And you really feel hate for your nemesis and when you beat him you find yourself standing up and cheering... That's how it is for me anyways. Now, the new Pokemon games I never bought, although I was tempted. But, why are they so great? What makes them so cooool?
