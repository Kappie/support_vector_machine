According to Nicole, who I rarely talk to...but i actually introduced her to dave, and now dave talks to her quite a bit. Well Ive been listening to music...i drank some crazy juice from my secrete stash at about 8...and i can still feel it... but I fell asleep from like 11 to 1:30am. Now it's 4:30 and I still dont wanna go to sleep..but suprisingly a lot of people are online so I will give it atleast another 30mins+. Damn, I broke my lamp..with the expensive "energy saving" light bulb...Cause it just smashes down onto the table every once n a while--but this time a coke can was in the way. Now I am scared of the electricity/fumes/having to buy a new light bulb. Prolly wont be an energy saving bulb this time tho :-(
