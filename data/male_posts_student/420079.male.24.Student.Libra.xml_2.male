First study for the LSATs. Then write the law school essay. Then fill out the applications. Now, however, I find myself with a load of time when I come home from work. I plan to fill much of that time with getting back in shape.  It's not that I'm  out  of shape -- I can still run 3 or 4 miles without stopping to walk too much -- but I am not in as good a shape as I was during the height of my first Body for Life Challenge. Nor do I look as good. I am eager to get all of that back.  So today I begin. I went shopping last night for healthy food, and today I have had a protein drink, handful of grapes, and a turkey sandwich. Tonight I will do upper body, and probably take my Before picture. In a couple of days my digital caliper is coming, and I will be able to know exactly what my body fat percentage is.  I'm currently 187 pounds, and I'm guessing 17 percent body fat. My goal is to get down to 8 percent body fat. Assuming I gain 3 pounds of muscle, in order to have an 8% BF level I will have to weigh 172 pounds.  So in other words, my goals are: 1) Lose 18 pounds of fat 2) Gain 3 pounds of muscle  I think, if I achieve those two goals, that will mean everything else will have fallen into place.  Now, let's do the weekly breakdown:  Day 0: Jan 6  - 187 lbs, 17% body fat Day 7: Jan 13 - 186 Day 14: Jan 20 - 184 Day 21: Jan 27 - 182 Day 28: Feb 3 - 180 Day 35: Feb 10 - 178 Day 42: Feb 17 - 176 lbs, 11% body fat Day 49: Feb 24 - 175 Day 56: Mar 3 - 174 Day 62: Mar 10 - 173 Day 69: Mar 17 - 173 Day 77: Mar 24 - 172 Day 84: Mar 31 - 172 lbs, 8% body fat  (Those last few weeks are where the lost fat and gained muscle cancel each other out.)  Hmmm... If I could get down to 172 by the end of March, that would be really good. The thing is, I *know* this is very doable, as I lost even more weight last time. It just surprises me that March 31 is only 12 weeks from now, and I can actually make such a transformation in that time. Hmm....  OK, time to get back to work :-)
