If I don't talk to some people at school this year it's because you really fucking got on my nerves last year, so if anyone's reading this they can inform them. I've decided it's time to stop being something I hate and start being myself for once.This includes not hiding it when I get pissed off at someone, I'm tired of sitting there and taking the shit shoveled at me. Call me an asshole all you want, I really don't care anymore, I'm depressed right now, no it has nothing to do with me breaking up with stephanie, it's deeper then that, like a cut that can't quite heal, except it's deep down inside. So to all the people I've ever hated,  F    U    C    K        Y    O    U
