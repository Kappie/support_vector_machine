I guess it was alright though, I watched two episodes of Elimidate, that show is awesome. Brings out the worst in some of those girls I suppose though. I feel for some of those guys on there, all they do is fight with each other trying to prove how  "good"  they are. Give me a break. Relationships are more than that. But whatever, it's entertainment right?  I actually woke up before noon today. I am surprised at that, but I knew I had too. I am heading to the hospital for around 1:30, then I will stay there until around 3:00, then head to work for the evening.   Tonight's a coffee night, as well as tomorrow I think (I'm a coffee whore, LOL). So I will be at Berries tonight. I am enjoying the last little bit of time where we are able to smoke within a business. July 1st is when that stupid no smoking by-law goes into effect. It's fucking stupid, you can't even smoke on the property of your workplace, or better yet ANY place of business you goto. It's bullshit in my opinion, us smokers have no fucking rights! We all know it's bad but let it be our choice, and whoever runs a business (Like a bar, or restaurant) shouldn't have to run it smoke-free if they don't want too. I just find it so ironic and hypocritical to encourage drinking in a bar, which could cause so much trouble - Like getting in a car drunk and killing someone, or drinking too much and getting alcohol poisoning - but we'll make you stand OUTSIDE for one measly cigarette.  Ah well, it's bullshit but theres nothing anyone can do. Besides this stupid by-law we have that federal election coming up soon (I'm too young to vote yet though) which is a huge joke. This country is going to go for a shit and I can see it clearly.  Stupid Politics.   .:Sinful_Misery:.  urlLink My Site   Later guys, I'll post sometime tonight.
