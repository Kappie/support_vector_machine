I love what I believe to be slumbering inside all human beings, but detest what they do with it.  I know many people who have realized that they are intelligent.  I believe that I am as well.  But most of the folks that have noticed that they have more knowledge of the world around them want to use that knowledge to force others to agree with them.  I think that it would be better to lift the fetters that those people place on others and allow them to make decisions on their own.  But that is why I will never do anything with my time on this plane.  I'll keep trying, because I am a masochist.  I think I will not even make a dent, but at least I am not filled only with hate...I have love as well.  Fuck you.
