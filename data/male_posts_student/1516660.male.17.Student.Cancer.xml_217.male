Yeah yeah. I know. Screw me. But heck! I will sutdy hard tomorrow. And it's not gonna be an empty promise!  Okay...yesterday, my father did not work. Instead, he brought us out to breakfast. After that, we came back and laze around till lunch-time. You know, I like listening to my mother talk on the phone. She always curse her boss (lao-yao-guai) for being bitchy/unreasonable, or gossip about her colleagues with another colleaque (Yong Kee, I believe. She and my mom are the only part-time cashiers, and almost the same working hours.). So funny...hahaha!!   Okay, we had lunch at Admiralty Place, where I met Su Ping, Xue Lin and Clar. Waved hello and bye bye. HaHa! Oh oh! I brought my Makin Magic!! Oh my god! So cute! So cool! But I can't install it, cuase I need Superstar. However, I ain't getting one till Monday...so I placed my MM on top of my computer table. It looks nice like that. :) Oh oh! And guess what? My mom brought a PS2 for my brother! Can you believe it? I na't...she said she won't buy it. Ahh...but she still did. I wonder why. I think they struck lottery or something, but didn't tell us. Hmm!! And I picked up quite a few games too (free ones of course). Like X-Men, Harvest Moon. No FFX though. Awww. The X-Men game is cool! I love Storm! So beautiful. I learnt a move le...hmm! I wish there are more X-Men, like Jublilee or something. The Street Fighter game is cool too! I used the female fighters (Chun-Li) especially. And I was able to win! Woo-hoo! When I mentioned it to my friends (actually, only Wendy, XC and WQ), both Wendy and WQ exclaimed their jealousy. Thay's why leh, I didn't want to mention it at first one. In fact, I only mentioed I got a PS2 when I said I "gotta go play with brother". Meow!   Hmm...Survivor was a shocker. Andrew Savage got voted out. That's because Lil joined the Drake team to vote him off! Yeah. Lil and Burton joined the game! Woo-hoo! Predicted. Hmmm, can someone please vote Jon off?! I hate him. Ergh!   Okie...today, I went to Wendy's house to celebrate CQ's birthday! Yep! I arrived there at 12.53 (after lunch at 768 with family. Yep...Father didn't work today. I really wonder if they won lottery!). I was like talking with Wendy when WQ suddenly appeared in the doorway. Wah lao. Just stand there without helloing. HaHa! After that leh, we talk talk a bit, then I go down to buy cake with Wendy. I brought Lassie down too. She's so inquistive. Keep sniffing here and there. HaHa! I brought the same cake as we did for Arman. Then, we returned and we talk talk some more. Until Wendy remembered we didn't buy any drink. So, I went down to buy a large bottle of Ice Lemon Tea (CQ's fav). I have to walk all the way to 888's NTUC coz the shop downstairs has no ILT stocks. Then, I walked back, and just when I was about to press the lift button, guess who messaged? Ah Ji. He arrrived. Woah!! I groaned loudly (to the stares of the people near me).I had to walk back and from twice!! HaHa!! I met him, and guided him to Wendy's house.  Yep! The celebration begins! We began by presenting the cake and drinks. While doing so, WQ actually whipped out his digital camera and started taking pictures/videos! Cool! I put in the candles, and lit some of them. The rest Wendy lit. We sang the birthday song (in Chinese) for Ah Ji. He then made a wish and blew out the candles. Wee!! We then cut the cake into 4 separate parts and ate them lor. We attempted to shoot Ah Ji while eating. We did it after some success! HaHa! I washed the dishes after everyone's done.  After that, we played Chocobo Racing till 5. HaHa! That's the reason why I didn't revise today. And I told Wendy "I got my priorities right and would squeeze time to study a-maths tomorrow." Ha! And hor, I cannot win today leh! Why!! Why!! I lost to WQ, a very newbie you know. HaHa! It sounds like I am very revengeful and a sore loser. These 3 people ganged up against me you know. So unfair. Hmp! I am so jinxed today. Ha!   After returning home, guess what I saw on my desk?!! SUPERSTAR!! Oh god!!! I can install the Sims now!! Woo-hoo! After a very quick bath, I set to install my game. I tried defraging the disk and cleaning it, but I gave up after it failed thousands of time. I went ahead the installation without doing anything. And guess what? I was able to install properly! The patching system of Makin Magic, which supposedly takes 40 minutes, took me about 15 minutes! Woo! And you know what? No bugs at all! Woo-hoo! I never encountered any bugs. I think that's because Singapore makes the Sim games themselves. :) So cool! My Sims can finally make magic!   Alright! Gotta be going to play Sims! See ya tomorrow! Night blog!
