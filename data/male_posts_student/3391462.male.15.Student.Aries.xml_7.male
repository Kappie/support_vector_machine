I just don't understand why he or she says this way even though it pushes the respect others have towards him or her. Now one thing that I have learned is that girls are very sensitive towards hate towards other people but they seem to have the idea that if they do it to other girls or a boy that it seems to be cool, because they are always laughing at some point. Differences should be able to resolved with apologies and forgiveness but many won't accept the "defeat" of apologizing. Seemingly thinging that it will be down their repututation and the "coolness" that they spread around. You have to act responsibly and say "Yes, I did that and I am sorry," Stupid Pussies that think that they are too good for that are pricks and aren't good enough to other people. But, the one thing, the one thing that really pisses me off is that these people are the popular kids, the ones that everyone respect for some outrageous reason, they are using you and if they see it good enough hit you, it isn't worth it. So throw down differences and embrace who you are and if anyone gives you guff, screw it you are better than that!
