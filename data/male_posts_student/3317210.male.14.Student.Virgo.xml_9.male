I've just started holidays and lets look upon what the world has put forth. My parents are growling at each other, as per usual, I don't have _any_ plans for the holidays apart from braces (oh, great...), two of my best friends I can't really communicate with (both without computers, one's grounded, the other, well), and generally I feel like complete... yeah...  In these times, one of the main problems is that we dwell on all the bad things, it's almost like we're trying to give ourselves a reason to feel so bad. Personally, I still do it, but if I want to feel bad, chances are I'm not inflicting damage on anyone but myself, and so I have the ultimate control in decisions of mood. I usually only break down at home, I don't think I've ever broken down at school, at least since Year 3...  I'd love to ask  the girl  out, but I just keep putting artificial limits on myself. And, I mean, there's a difference between sitting here and saying 'She'd probably say yes' and standing next to her, the mind reverting to another answer...  Okay, I don't like how I feel at the moment, so, this I must ENDETH!   Creativity, a good pick-me-up  After picking up some of my old txt documents, blowing the digital dust off them, and having a revising read, I feel inspired, ish =)  Actually, I'm not so inspired   To disappear  I'm going to disappear for a bit, go read some Elysiun stuff... Sorry for such a short post (even though, as I said a million times before, no-one's reading)
