I really can't think of anything to say right now, you can basically sum up my day in a few words.  School, Studying, and Swimming.    Kind of in a sad mood right now, I don't really know why.  I think it's just one of those 'blah' days.  It'll get better later, hopefully.  I am really not in the exam studying mood.  We did this trivia thing in 6th hour and the girls (Melissa, Katie, Jessica) on my team basically talked about how big their chests were and how many boys  and  girls they've kissed.  In fact, Melissa has kissed more girls than guys I guess.  Rambling is fun.  I'm out.  By the way, I have it set so anyone can post comments on my entries, not just blogspot members.
