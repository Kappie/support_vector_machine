And, for the most part it seems true.  I AM misunderstood, I most certainly am revolutionary, and unusual, mystical and spiritual as well.  I don't know about judicial - am I guys?  What luck.  I typed in another name and it came up with both normal and odd.  Some astrology, however, can outwardly appear very true.  Take my Chinese Zodiac - I was born in the year of the Dragon, and show many of the traits assciated with it.  I also, however, show most of the traits of the snake and tiger, and some of those of the monkey.  And this seems to be what astrology is based upon - make enough generalisations and you are likely to be right for a fair proportion of people.  But the Chinese Zodiac works on a yearly basis - are half the people in my year group at school also going to posess the traits of the Dragon?  I don't think so.  The monthly Zodiac might be more convincing, if it weren't for the fact that I show none of the traits at all posessed by my sign, the taurus.  But is astrology and supserstition utterly useless?  No, I don't think so.  The advice given in horoscopes, or anything of that nature, is always generalised, and every time I read the horoscope section in the Metro (which isn't that often at all), I can identify with any of the star signs.  But while the astrologers can make their advice fit anybody, we too can mould their advice to our needs, and I find that if I have no other option in an important decision I can go and read a horoscope and read what I will from what is there.  That way I try to forget that it is all essentially bollocks, and gain some confidance in whatever decision I am making by the advice it gives me.  That was the daily advice.  But what about having your character defined by what year/month you were born in?  No real use, but good for an ego-trip.
