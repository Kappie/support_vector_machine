(sadly it's in like october.. so i can't go) so the library 'class' we had last week was helpful in using the Wally library's databases.. but there really isn't a whole lot of info out there, so it's pretty long, and boring work. Dr. Basu from the U of R came and talked to us as well.. about rocks.. and the earth.. it was ok.. we will get to use his rock collection.. which includes meteors .. fun stuff.. uh.. what else.. OH! tomorrow on i don't have to go in until 8:45!!! woohoo! half an hour later is cool! and we've declared tuesdays to be eat-out day.. tomorrow will be the China Buffet!  and hopefully the weather will be good for volleyball (which is also tomorrow-- tuesdays are the best days...)
