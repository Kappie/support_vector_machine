Kurt will be running the place in my absence and Nathaniel will continue to post his music and movie reviews.  There is one thing, however, that will be in the back of my mind the entire trip. The one thing that will have Toronto buzzing for the next 10 days or so. Will Ed Belfour resign with the Maple Leafs? Lets just keep our fingers crossed. The draft is June 26th and 27th, and would like to wish all the teams luck. Except Ottawa and Philadelphia.  For those who can, please vote on June 28th. As I have said before, it's your chance to have your voice heard, so take advantage of the opportunity. Remember: you cannot complain about the way things are being run in Canada if you couldn't take the time to vote.  Lastly, Matthew Good's second solo album  White Light Rock and Roll Review  came out this past Tuesday, and I highly recommend it.  Bye for now.  Or should I say Au Revoir.
