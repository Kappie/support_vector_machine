Which took more courage then she'd know, seeing as I have no self-confidence and a jealous guarding of privacy. Well, yeah..the first thign she does is scroll down to the first entry. WHich immediately says I love Aisha so mcuh. INTERACTIVE TIME- Scroll down and look for yourself. OOOHHH, technology. yes. Right. So she asks me, you love aisha? I thought you were just friends? Well, see, we are, yeah(with extras ;)), but we've been through a lot so yeah, I love her. That would be ok. I mean, who cares if someone loves someone else? Now's the wird part- why would Brighton care? Now she's mad at me, and won' talk to me, even thoguh I've said hi, sorry a lot, and I GAVE EHR A FLOWER. this really nice rose..and I didn't know she'd feel crappy, so i took the biggest one I could find from a bush at school while a teacher was standing nearby. Those are expnsve!!! ANd i could get in trouble for that. Chhhh but no, whatever. During SPanish, the whoolle time, shes tearing it apart. And whenever she could, she gave me dirty looks. Even Jennifer noticed!!!!!!!!!!  Ack. Why would she care if I loved Aisha?   GIRLS ARE ICKY  lol  they're confusing and mean. I mean, what'd I ever do to her? And then she told Sloane. How incredibly nice of her.  Yay!   Grrrr. Not cool. And what'd worse, she's going to Australia for two weeks tonight. Mhm, at leats I'll be able to write whatever I want?  OH MY GOSH.  lol..christine jsut turned off something...  ANd my screen went off. ANd it all would have gone away. Okay I'm going RIGHT NOW!!!!   Ill call Aisha, maybe. i don't know if i have enough money. Ohw ell  MUCH LOVE  peace  ~alex
