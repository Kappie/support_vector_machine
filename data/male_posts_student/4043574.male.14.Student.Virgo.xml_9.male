Jerry bought Katie a glass flower and he was to scared to give it to her...he sat on it and it stabbed him in the ass when it broke, and then clanged to the floor..it was so fucking funny because me and him were joking that it might happen.  Jerry was holding my step moms cell, and i forgot to get it back from him...so i had to ride up to his house...which is all up hill. And i had to mow the lawn...my step mom wont leave me alone...and i have to get a haircut too...i get no time to relax today.  OOO! OMG! Shes back! I missed her soo much! Yay! Jordan is back! Hooray!
