Tim Pawlenty, the man who has endorsed  urlLink God on our state capitol's front steps , is  heartbroken  that his musical idol Bruce Springsteen is  urlLink anti-Bush and making it a message . "I really appreciate his music, but I wish he wouldn't interject his music with politics," Tim was quoted as saying. Tough shit! I'm sick of that "Proud to be an American" song they play at the Twins games, but you don't see an AP story about that, now do you? Ugh!  If you're interested in getting tickets for the  urlLink Vote For Change tour , I'd suggest  urlLink signing up for pre-sale  as soon as possible. From what I've been hearing in other markets ( urlLink Billmon is desperate ), these things are going  fast . Hell, maybe I'll even try to get a ticket.
