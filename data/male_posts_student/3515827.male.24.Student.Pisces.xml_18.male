From time to time they will come up with meanial tasks for me to preform, but even then I manage to put them off.  But the pay is great and I get to go online and read all day.  However, I'm more than ready to leave.  I think it's a bit early in my life to become this lazy, plus I think I've milked it for all it's worth.  Now don't think I sit on my butt all day, I do get some stuff done.  Just look at this piece of art I made for the wall outside my cubical:        Clockwise the characters are:  urlLink Picard ,  urlLink Riker ,  urlLink Crusher ,  urlLink Worf ,  urlLink Q ,  urlLink Wesley ,  urlLink The Borg Queen ,  urlLink Yar ,  urlLink Guinan ,  urlLink La Forge ,  urlLink Data , and  urlLink Troi .  The  urlLink Enterprise D  is on the minute hand with a  urlLink Romulan Warbird  on the hour.  Now you maybe surprised that art made with such fine craftsmanship has some minor errors (which were quickly pointed out by several of the engineer/trekies in my office).  The ships are not to scale, as the Warbird is, from what information The Federation has, twice the size of Enterprise D. (Don't you love the fact that this ship, nay the entire Romulan species, was created by someome's imgaintion but that someone takes it so seriously  as to say we have limited intellegence about them.)  Also, Miss Thang, Queen of The Borg, was never technecailly in an episode of Star Trek TNG, as we first see her in the movie First Contact (the best one if you ask me).  However, Picard knew her from when he was asimulated during the series, so in a way, she was.  And frankly, I like the bitch.  I know she tried to travel back in time to assimliate Earth, but  I'm sure she had the best of intentions.
