"bug #xxxx" works though from gaim and xchat. and i have no idea how to go about getting evolution to send clues. some patch i guess, hopefully i wouldn't have to recompile it because that would be hell. beagle-index-mail tries to look in a directory that doesn't exist for mail and i'm thinking the evolution userdata directory structure changed since it was made. oh, and dashboard tries to call Beagle.Hit.GetaData(string) which doesn't exist, and, being new to beagle, i don't know what i could change the code to to make it work the same, so i just commented out the only two lines that did that. they were just for photos, and i don't have my digital camera yet, so..  but i'm still having fun with dashboard, and i hope  urlLink ximian  continues steady work on it.
