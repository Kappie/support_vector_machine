Something happens to them or someone they know that makes them step back and really think about what is important to them.  For some people it is a tragic loss or an amazing victory, but either way, it is usually something profound to trigger the little process of evaluation of one's life.  This is the time, for a brief moment, that you take nothing for granted and live every minute for all it is worth.  Between these little moments is the grind that we go thru day in and day out.  With that being said, I am pleased to say that I have the honor to lay pipe on this fine board.    This is in no way a trigger for a moment of reflection in my life, but really a new part to my grind. May we all not take life for granted so much of the time.  Please do not expect to find me writing on literature, politics, drama, and all the other stuff that Moe enjoys.  I can only promise to write, which for me, is a major accomplishment.
