Megan Bowman was supposed to come, but she didn't have time before work so she went tanning instead. Mark was supposed to come, but he got seen by his tennis coach and couldn't.   To all my juniors and seniors at Prom, Have the best time of your lives!   To all my friends going to an afterprom party... Party like is yo' Birthday!     You know I party like an animal guys >;), but please remember to get a DD! You could hurt yourself or other... Or get your license taken away like half the other kids I know.       Be safe         I
