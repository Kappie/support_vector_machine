Because the school's computers really suck, it has been one of the most boring days ever.  Mrs. Checketts wasn't in today, but they still managed to keep the lesson waiting 20 minutes    We have started coursework in Chemistry and both Physics now (oh yess  ) and we did both lessons in... the computer room!  I've discovered that it is possible to set the keytones on some of the keys on the keyboard at school; yet another way to annoy teachers!  If you see me about at school I'll tell you how to do it so we can spread the key bleeping-ness    French was really boring.  We finished of our Coursework and I sat there doodling for half of the lesson.  Dinner was ok, but really boring.  We spent period 5 in Miss Humphries's uiet room because I didn't bring my ingredients.  It was fun in there anyway.  A certain person launched paper airplanes from the fire extinguisher lol!  Period 6 was in the library and me and Ross set the keytones on and got on Mrs. Gardener's and Miss Humphries's nerves lol.  So I guess the day has been okay, if you count the bleeping... *bleep*
