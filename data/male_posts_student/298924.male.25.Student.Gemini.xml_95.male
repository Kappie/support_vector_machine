I made three attempts to post a tribute to my strong as hell, great role model of a black man, Dad....yesterday was his 52nd birthday and he worked harder to get to this one than he ever has....I am so proud of my dad I don't think I can adequately express it....if I can grow to be half the man he is I will be okay....  In the meanwhile I am also very proud of my friend  urlLink Beth ....I already knew how intelligent she is (I have the honor of talking to her pretty much daily)....but still she never ceases to amaze me.....check her out....I see big things happening in her future!  Here goes nothing....if this doesn't save....adios Blogger
