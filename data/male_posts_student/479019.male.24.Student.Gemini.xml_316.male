I might go out for a drink with Naomi and Heather tonight though... tomorrow I'm gonna catch the Irvine versus Woodbridge duel. No plans Friday night... maybe I'll call up Brandon and we'll go out for a drink. Saturday is lunch with the family and dinner with girls. Sunday it's back to Binghamton.  In rotation right now is  Social Distortion   ***
