When I got home I went to my computer and went looking for this sweet bike I saw at Meijer last week,  urlLink here it is , the only problem is that it comes in 20" and 16" sizes, I hope im not to big. But it gets even tighter because im gonna add a motor to it because im lazy,  urlLink click here for example , so if im not to big im gonna get it because its gonna be the closest thing to a motorcycle im gonna get while living here with my parents.  But anyways I gotta read my swell book 1984 today so my mom will get off my case, then I can go and have some fun.
