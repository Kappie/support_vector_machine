Speaking of commitee, I'm finally out of the Worship Commitee. Woohoo! It wasn't that bad, but I can't take the time constraint anymore, especially if I'm joining the Youth Leadership Commitee soon (does this constant parade of commitees ever end?!?[No]). Also, I finally joined the local YMCA. I plan to exercise regularly. Ha. Right. Let's see if I can pull that off.  Where I'm not going right now...well, I'm not doing my resume. I better start that ASAFP (guess what the "F" stands for). But I don't. I'm a terrible procrastinator. How long have I had these job applications now? 2 weeks? More? The mom machine is starting to ride on me to get this done, and with good cause.
