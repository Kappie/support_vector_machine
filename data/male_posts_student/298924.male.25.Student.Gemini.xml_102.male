Firstly....I turned to Tech TV as I sometimes do in my TV viewing and I saw a little segment telling people about Blogger and how to blog....the chick on there seemed to be on the far left end of the bell curve in terms of intelliegence as she kept clicking the post button instead of post and publish and then getting mad because it wouldn't show up on her page....I found the whole thing to be kind of funny....  Also I saw a couple of my favorite episodes of two of my favorite sitcoms ever....the Cosby Show was an episode featuring the Grandparent's 50th anniversary (the second one...not the one with the Ray Charles song, but the one with the James Brown song)....what I liked about this episode was not just the whole song and dance routine (which, it should be noted, was VERY good)....I liked Elvin's interaction with Cliff and Claire in this episode more than anything....Cliff teaches him this whole "hands off" technique for dealing with Huxtable women which was just hilarious....and then this jackass goes into the kitchen to open a jar of pickles (A man's job he says) and immediately has to employ it....it's pretty funny....then I wake up this morning and the Fresh Prince is on....lo and behold it's the BBD episode....also featuring Geoffrey getting to play the big shot role and messing up Phil and Vivian's getaway weekend....it's the little things (as Joe would say).....  On another note....I feel very badly for attempting to trick a friend of mine with this e-mail that tries to pry deep dark secrets from them....my boy Nile tricked me with it and for a split second I thought it might be funny...but in hindsight I kind of violated her trust and I feel bad about it....what's worse is that I sent it to two other people....luckily said friend is much smarter than me and was not fooled....she says it wasn't a big deal....I still feel bad....sorry!!!  On the menu today....Killa Cal makes Nachos!!!....it's gonna be hell to clean up....but heavenly on my stomach!!
