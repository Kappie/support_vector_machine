I worked all day, and it was horrid. I had so many angry customers and irate people being transferred to me for 8 hours straight. It was evil I swear. It's really annoying when you try to explain and do your best for the customer, but yet they are still not satisfied. I told one consumer, that I didn't appreciate being sworn at and that I was trying to explain what happened, and what I can do to fix it for her. She got really snotty with me, but eventually listened and when I did everything I could that still wasn't enough for her because she had to wait a few weeks to get her money.   If only people could learn to relax, and be patient. I guess the world revolves around number one, so it seems anyway. Pisses me off, it's not just the people I deal with on a daily basis, but everyone in general. They will do anything to save their asses, to increase their well-being etc. No respect at all. It's sad, and pathetic.   Anyways, I took another shift tomorrow, so I am working another 11:30 AM - 8:00 PM shift. Then I work 12:00 PM - 6:00 PM on Saturday, off Sunday, then 8:00 AM - 4:30 PM on Monday. I am so excited though because I start my holidays on Wednesday, and I head to Winnipeg in two weeks! Summer rocks :)  I had written this poem last night, it's about open mindedness.. enjoy!   Open  Generic ridicule, Cheap stimulation; Are that of a simple mind  Thoughtful opinions, Modish revival; Are that of an open mind  Amateur thought, Not caring why; Is that of an unpretentious mind  Deep contemplation, Wondering why; Is that of a transcendent mind  Simple versus open, Unpretentious versus transcedent,  Can be compared too,  Seeing what you want, versus seeing everything Caring about what you want, versus caring about all; Unimaginable benefits, compared to thinking in tact.  Minds are elaborate Humans are as well.  To choose your elaborated style To truly peer into yourself  Will only produce an outcome, If you open yourself, open your mind.
