I personally think that people should try and have open minds about the opposing position because it could give them more of a perspective on not only the opposite side, but their own side, too. I am glad that we are researching this topic because we need to see how the economic policy that Bush has implemented will affect us in the future. From the articles that I read though, it seems as though Bush's 10-year plan is trying to help the middle class when it will most likely benefit to the wealthy instead. Now it is hard for me to believe everything that one reporter thought, so I am going to look for more facts and see if Bush's plan is actually helping America and not just cutting taxes and putting more of a burden on the middle class. Hope everyone has a good night!
