My hair is screwed as HELL , and my face is even whiter than normal , none of my clothes match and im always fucken sweating or freezing to death. Never mind the fact that i probably have chicken pox or scurvey or something, now i look like a 20 year old dog who hasn't eaten in 27 years. Also, I think that Ching Chongs Guide To Ninjas and Codes and Stuff is funny.
