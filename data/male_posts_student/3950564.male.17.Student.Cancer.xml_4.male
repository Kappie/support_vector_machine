So far I have heard of all the expected scores from people, like all the ones who have 5s!  GodI can't wait untilI can drive; I am thinking about taking the test next week, then I will be free. I can go places, like parties and peoples houses, without relying on other people. FREEDOM! Hopefully my license will jump startmy social life,wait,it will have to create onefirst. HMMM...I think thatwill be it for now. Its getting late,I will update tomorrow with hopefully more to type andI will report on the outcome ofmy AP scores! The damn post office better deliver it or there will behell to pay.
