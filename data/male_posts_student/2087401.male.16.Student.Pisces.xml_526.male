Besides all that, part of each day has to be devoted to working out for Show Choir season and relearning German II.  Hopefully there'll still be some time to relax. If not, though, I won't complain.  I'm learning how to enjoy the busy life.  I'm sure it's something that'll come in handy later in life.  I only have two things left to say to you, and that was one, and I guess technically that was the other one, which makes this the third so actually I'm already way over.
