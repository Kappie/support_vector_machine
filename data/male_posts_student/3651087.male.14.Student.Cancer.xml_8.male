I was twelve and one of the oldest in the class .She was eleven and the youngest in the class.I was awkard and shy.She wasn't.  I wore baggy overalls,sweatshirts and lime green hiking boots.Paris wore nike shoes.I could not stand her,she was my enemy .She liked me and so we became friends.At first ,I hate her to the core but now I treat her as my best pal isn't it a good thing.
