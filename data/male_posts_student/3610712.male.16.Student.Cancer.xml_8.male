Also attending was Luke, Eric, Jay, Sarah A., and Yamina.  urlLink Altisonus  played for about an hour, then we sat around and talked and Luke, Eric, and Yamina performed satanic rituals. Then I got home at about 12:30 then got on and talked to Sarah on AIM until about 4 a.m. Then I watched Fox  Friends on Fox News until it started getting light outside, forcing me to hide under my blanky.
