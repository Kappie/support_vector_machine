Even so, I woke up every 5-10 minutes this morning starting at around 7:00.  ALso, I think didn't want to sleep through the appointment.  When I arrived at the Shawnee Hall, I met my instructor as she was just walking back after testing Jared Smith (He got his license).  She led my outside where we went to the bike and checked signals, brake, horn, etc.  I was given a radio deal, thicker than a pack of cigarettes which clipped on my jacket.  She then followed me in a car given me command from a radio.  At first, I never thought this clip-on system would actually work, but it was fine.  I did some left and right turns through-out town.  Yields, stops, the whole bit.  She even took me onto the highway, and it wasn't an 80 km speed zone which I was only permitted to.  I went out to the vet clinic on this highway then did a two-point turn... yeah... weird.  :S  We went back to town turning a few more.  On my right turns, my blocking position was off.  She came right up behind me.  She told me after this was my warning to move more to the right so a car can't pass.  Thing is, you have to be in the middle, can't be to far right, or you can be passed on the left.  Can't be too far left or they can pass you on the right.  So, what was to be my last turn, she came to the right and drove by and said, 'Let's go back to the office.' in a somewhat bitter voice.  I parked and walked over to her vehicle with a feeling of failure.  She told me that my blocking positions needed work.  I immidiately thought, see you in 2 weeks!  As she stood by her car, clipboard on the hood, I could tell she was debating whether to give it to me.  She also said that I was a tad to close to the center line.  So if she marked both of those, I would be done she said.  But, I was only marked for my blocking position on the right turns.  I believe she left the center line because I never crossed it and I was consistent on my position, it was not like I couldn't control being that close.  I was that close all exam.  So, in the end, I got it!  I felt great and thankful.  Thanks to the instructor... I think she felt that she didn't want me coming back to do the exam in two weeks because of a simple blocking position.  She made sure I understood what I was doing, and I stated I was aware of my mistake.  I was basically understanding and resonable, and for that, I think I earned it.  She stated there was nothing to dock me on and I had great control of the bike.  She also commented on my baby... :D  So, I shook her hand, thanked her, and went to SGI to renue my license.  I walked to my bike, and Tyler was riding up the street.  I hooked up with him and we did some riding.  We rode a few miles north of town, I tried to keep up.  We got him some mroe gas, then we went out to the golf course to visit my sister and grab some lunch.  After that, back into town, and back north on 36 highway again.  I got my bike up to 180 km!  I was so pumped!  Before, I was slowly getting there chasing Tyler down the highway, 140, 160, each run getting more comfortable.  I am proud of myself.  COnsidering, last year, I only had to bike up to about 130.  This year, I had only had it up to 100 until last night.  Great progress these past few days.  Having someone to ride with makes riding A MILLION times funner.  I am becoming a better rider because of it.  After all this riding, I went home rested a bit before I went to work at 1:30.    Tonight, I will be hanging out with Laura after I cut a lawn.  It was a productive, good, and happy day for me! :D
