But as before, I can not rule in my heart. It's independent and stupid. Been taken aback by his decision was something I did not expect, I saw it coming weeks before. This decision I thought was coming by my side. Nevertheless, waiting as I see now, was not his plan. I feel now we were not meant to be, we had too much in common, everything but love. We are friends, that I can say. We like each other. But at the end  he  wanted a partner, not a boyfriend. And at the moment I can not offer more. We had discussed the issue once and it was a heated argument.  Is somewhat strange. I've been aching for love. Someone gives it to me and I just turn around and don't look back. It was just a matter of time, I could have fall in love, but again, choices were made and none of them were good at the end; not the ones I made, not the ones he made. And as corny as it sounded, and as a rip off of S it may be, what he did say at the end is what I been feeling this whole time:  I need to be loved. Madly in love. "Cannot live without each other" love. Insane, dependent love. "Just a sight, and I loose my breath" love.   I'm sorry I did not deliver, I tried. But again, it is not to me to decide who am I gonna love. It just happens. And from here on, expectation! What a dread!
