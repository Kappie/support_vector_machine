Being my first time there, I was confused. Well...not really. It was pretty straight-forward: shoot people with laser. On the first game, I placed 17 out of 23, then the second, I placed 10 out of 24. Eh heh, I'm just happy that I'm not last. A surprising thing is... i had a 90% hit-miss ratio... oo;; which means that for every 10 shots I took, I got nine... weird, cause I thought I missed more than that. It was a pretty fun experience ^^;;     After that, we went to Putting Edge for lunch (which was 2 slices of pizza and unlimited drinks), and played mini-golf... Keane remembers mini-golf, ne? ^^;; Out of the 4 people I played with, I scored the best... like 3 under par or something like that.      Ah... when we got back, I waited for half an hour for the Playdium people (and Keane) to come back... waited for like half an hour, and watched as the rock-climbing people and the skating people return... then I was like  meh  and left. When I got off at Finch, I saw the schoolbus carrying Playdium people back to school... what irony...^^;;     Ah well, good day altogether, hope you had fun today snow-tubing! (*glares* you  better  have had fun...)   ~Chronos
