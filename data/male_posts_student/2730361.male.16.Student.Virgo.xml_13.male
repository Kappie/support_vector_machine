Just to prove to all of my friends just how much of a nerd i am i went and got accepted into a 7 week program at UF that is basically an entire semester at school. So because of this i have just two weeks of actual vacation before i go off to college and i get back less than a week before we return to school and only two days before my first band rehearsal. Sounds like fun doesnt it. But then again you have to look at it as being away from sisters and parents for almost two months while living in dorms on a college campus. Maybe its not so bad after all. Well talk to ya later.
