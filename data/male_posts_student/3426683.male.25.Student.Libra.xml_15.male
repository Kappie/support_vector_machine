I rented it mostly because I was bored, and the video store didn't have a terrific selection (also rented  urlLink School of Rock  and the international edition of  urlLink Trainspotting , which I've unbelievably never seen -- as to why I didn't watch those first, well, I don't know).    The main characters were barely likable, or, in the case of  urlLink Jacob Pitts's  character, completely unlikable.  Pitts resembles David Spade in the film, both in appearance and mannerisms, but has none of Spade's wit or polish.  The other cast members are passable, but there's nothing special here.  I wasn't even sure that they were having fun (which was most of the appeal of  urlLink American Pie 2  and  urlLink American Wedding , which I enjoyed a bit).    To be fair, the script by Alec Berg  David Mandel doesn't give any of the actors much to work with, pushing the characters through fairly conventional situations with familiar punchlines, all of which seemed to have been done better before.  For instance,  urlLink Tomcats  does the Surprise Dominatrix scene far better (now, of course, we've established that I've seen and remember  Tomcats  -- in my defense, it was on cable, I couldn't sleep, and my only other option was  urlLink Bordello of Blood , which I had seen the night before -- I don't want to talk about that).  Overall, it's a bad movie.  A really bad movie.  But it has two moments that I felt made it worth the price of rental:   Matt Damon in a cameo as the front man for a rock band, with a shaved head, tattoos, and a dog collar.  Made me do a double take.  Unlike most of the cast, Damon seems to have fun in his brief cameo.  A ridiculous slapstick sequence in the Vatican, which although predictable, flows well and the visual payoff of  urlLink Mechlowicz  in the Papal garb is uproarious.
