Took a cab hurriedly to Parkway Parade, located the Nokia Care Centre, and then waited for him to come. Man.... hes.. kinda  sissy... ah gua you know ? Somehow got a little bit of cold jitters down my spine... seeing the way he behaves... but look at it on the bright side, if hes like that, he mostly would be delicate with his things... and with no exception to the 6100. Hahaha. Paid him the $190 when he handed the set to me.  Pushed our phones in for flashing of the latest software and checks for faults on the 6100, and we went to have our lunch at the food court and played a few lame fighting games at E-Zone. Possibly one of the worst arcades around. And the poorest one at that.  Collected out phone at 2 pm, took bus 31 to Kallang MRT where I changed trains at Outram to Chinatown. Met Steve, Yap, KL, Heron, Ivan and Kira there. The loser, supposedly to have "forgotten" today's event, didnt come down. No balls, and it shows.  Played till 5.45 pm when I left with KL and Heron, took the train to Dhoby and going up to Bishan to look for some clothes to buy. Called up my mum, she was just about to go home from Sembawang coincidentally, so I decided to meet her and have dinner there.  So she came, and we have our dinner at Yoshinoya. Man... the 6 dollar meal is so damn worthy ! 3 pieces of chicken wings, a beef/salmon/chicken bowl and a regular Coke for $6 ! Had that again. Felt full and good after that.  Shopped for my stuff after that at Hang Ten and U2, bought some stuff that amounted up to $100.40 . Woo.. havent spent so much on clothes in a long time. Headed for home on bus 53 after that, and came home all tired and out for about 12 hours.... half a day.  Took a bath, saw some TV, and here I am. Had a very fulfilling day, and happy even though I'm tired out.  But a sad event marred this day : My godfather finally lost the battle to the cancer in his liver.. gave way, and gave up breathing, at 3.09 pm in the afternoon. Felt sad... but I got the news at around 9, so it didnt affect my mood outside... Yeah, thats it...  Rest in peace my beloved godfather...You will live in my memories and heart forever.  And good night. Argh.
