I've never seen it tabbed this way, on any sites with guitar tabs, but I prefer playing it this way.  Goldfinger plays it with heavy distortion, which is why it sounds spiffy.

There are mistakes in the solo, and possibly in other places, so watch out for those. Other than that, it's a pretty good tab.  Note: blogger won't let me post the vertical line-things, which is why the tab looks messy.
