Noah and I drew abbs on our stomachs with a red sharpie...went swimming in the creek a million times...sprayed glowing liquid stuff on each other...played kickball...played football...went paddle boating...played more kickball...sang...went crazy...and Noah, Daniel E, and I creamed the majority of Youth Group in ultimate frizbee. THere's nothing else i can really think of...but you get the picture. I just got back yesterday at like five O'clock. I"m real tired right now because I just got home from band practice.   I have to run...I'll definately do more tomorrow...more on the story thingy anyway...
