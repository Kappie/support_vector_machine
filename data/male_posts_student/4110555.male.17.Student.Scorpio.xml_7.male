I am Ben Salinas and am a senior at  urlLink The Science Academy of South Texas .  I, along with Baldo Vela and Steven Kroman, will be working on this project.  Our proposal and how it started:  About 9 months ago, I found the link to a grant opportunity for high school students from MIT known as  urlLink MIT InvenTeams  .  This was a $10,000 grant given to a team of high school students to invent something.  I was immediately intrigued and showed the link to Baldo and Steven.  We started discussing our ideas, and came up with a crude solution to a problem (or at least what we thought of as a problem).  We discussed our proposal with Mr. Mark Schroll, a teacher at our school, and he told us what we would need to do (essentially, prove that we had a problem before we invented a solution). We went off and did just that.   When the application for the grant was released in the spring, we had a head start on everyone else.  The spring application is supposed to be for the teacher to propose a possible idea, with no idea of a team in his mind.  We already had a team, and a possible idea. Not only did we have an idea, but we also had a solution to a proved problem.  We sent in our proposal and waited.  In July, we learned that we had not made the first cutoff in the grant application process.  We were obviously disappointed, but Baldo, Steven and I decided that we wanted to go on with our project. That brings us to today.  What is this project you might ask?  Stay tuned for more information.  -Ben Salinas
