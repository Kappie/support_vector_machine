It seems fairly inaccessible so far -- the history of the development of judicial procedure -- filing motions, collecting evidence, stuff like that.  Necessary stuff for courtroom law, but not the kind of stuff on Law and Order.  Or even on Court TV (actually, who knows... maybe there is a show on Court TV about civil procedure... I wouldn't know).
