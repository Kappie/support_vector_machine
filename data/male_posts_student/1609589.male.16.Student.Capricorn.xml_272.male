Current recievers are: Josh Eric  I'm not going to give you one for stuff you've done in the past, only now, so I can't automatically give all my friends awards.  Eric won for being so old school that he put a spaceballs quote in his profile...  And Josh won because he uses a friggin DOS prompt to control the universe :-O  So see,there is no general "badassery" to be had here, it's an unusual way of picking. You'll see.  Also, if you don't get the award right away(or never), don't feel bad. Kicking ass is not everyones job- if you think you should get it and you don't, I believe is that you're probably one of the ones up high, who are going to control us asskickers and tell us what to do. We bow to you.  My only 2 rules of disqualification are: 1. You ask for one 2. You become a brown noser to get one  That's it. It's fairly simple.
