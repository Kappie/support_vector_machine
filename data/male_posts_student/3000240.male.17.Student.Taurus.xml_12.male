Hope you enjoy it:  One Of Them  Oh how I wish to be someone else: To walk along the corridor with my head held high To be looked up to on my own actions To have my time completely filled. To experience what I have always naturally craved- Not to be patronised. That is what I have always longed for.  Once I was close, but never close enough, I was amongst them, smiled and laughed with them But never really there. Then one day, the whispers came Apparently I was not “all” man And with that, all smiles stopped Striking me down like a punch to the solaplexus  From which I never got up.  Having sold my secret soul to Damien Time, growth, life came to a hollow stop I existed inside the hell of my own Pandora’s Box. As my pain grew, their anger intensified; Small demons poked their fiery sticks through my bars As if they were never going to let me leave- Even heavenly intervention could not break their walls.  But over time, I was flung into memory Forever seen as an obsolete “faggot” at the back of the class. From time to time, their brimstone torched my body Until its casing hardened, formed a cast Inside which died my longing to be one of them.
