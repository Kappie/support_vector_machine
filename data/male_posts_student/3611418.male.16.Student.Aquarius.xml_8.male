Then i fail my algebra, sciance, and history finals. And my uncle dies.  Then my favorites president dies: Ronald Reagan. And my favorite blues singer dies: Ray Charles. Who else is gonna die? Everyone's dieing. I guess its the in thing to do: Just die! Where is my life taking me, thru heartbreak and pain. What else is there, nothin'. A person with no future. A rich fool!
