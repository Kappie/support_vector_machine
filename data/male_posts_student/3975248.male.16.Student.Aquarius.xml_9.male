I would have to say it definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. The title "The Village" really fits the movie well I think. When I read the description of it I didn't really understand what it was about, but after viewing it for about 20 minutes I started to catch on. I don't get scared very often, but this one did me pretty good. If you haven't seen The Village, I recommend it. It was an excellent flick, especially if you're into the scary/suspenseful movies. People who have seen it, let me hear your comments. I'm interested to know what you thought of the movie.
