Twere Rowan Atkinson not in it, I'd be disappointed in myself for spending my time there...but he can make the silliest gag funny.     urlLink This  star-studded movie looked wonderful...on its Sony Classics homepage.  But IMDB gives it a 5.1.  You often wonder how a movie with 15 true stars could falter.  Or how none of the stars could have the moxie to stand up at one moment and ask the director, "Why don't you guys buy an actual script with some of the budget?"    So many movies I want to watch.  It's one of the pluses of living with Tripper this coming year...the screenwriting cabal watching films on the big screen TV, sending out for NetFlix all the time.  I am a mediophile, one who loves to collect all things media (books, music, dvd), but I need to view more than I need to own.    My goal this next year is to watch a film a day, or at least stick to that pace.  And even with that, I will only watch 365 films in a year.    There are some wonderful contacts through TIP...I've met four Ph.D's from Duke, three in the writing profession and one in politics.  One of the writers is friends with a prominent screenwriting professor at The Florida State University (that's how the folks on Monday Night Football say it).  My main focus of research is in  Hollywood Format , and how women and minority film writers fit into the generic Hollywood mold.  My premise at the moment is that for a woman screenwriter to be considered an authority on the subject, she must have a gimmick.  Claudia Johnson, the friend, wrote what looks like a very good book called  urlLink Short Screenplays That Connect .  However, it is a specified, gimmick-ladden title...she is working in short works, and her gimmick is how it connects an audience.  Syd Field, on the other hand, can write  urlLink Screenplay , the opus of Screenwriting.  Why isn't he required to formulate a specific niche for his writing?
