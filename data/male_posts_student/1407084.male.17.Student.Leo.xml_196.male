Don't get me wrong, just because I spend most of my time sitting in front of a computer screen doesn't mean I don't love the outdoors. I definitely have a thing for building fires... on purpose or on accident.. *whistle*  I bought a frisbee at a trading post in Grand Marais. It's orange, and its the official ultimate frisbee weight or whatever. I think 175 grams? Oh well. Just a frisbee  Tomorrow night we are going to see the Twins play the Boston Red Sox at the Metrodome. Hopefully the Twins put on a decent performance.. I, for one, would be thoroughly overjoyed.  I have a yearning to have a LAN party soon. Chances are it will be for my 18th birthday which falls on August 18th. More details to come.  Keep it classy, Rochester.
