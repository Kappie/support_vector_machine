I finally got it after the extra day's wait (thanks a lot, stupid EB), and it is the most awesome game I think I have ever played, aside from Halo and a couple others.  From the time I got the game, the box art just screamed "This game is going to be the best you've ever played."  So, I got home, popped it in my Xbox, and got going.  And I've been having a hard time stopping.  This game is that awesome.  Already, I'm 14.5% completed with it, and it's been good so far.  There is so much to do...so many awards to unlock, so many bosses to beat, and they're tough!  But, they're definitely worth it, because this has got to be the BEST super hero game, and I can't wait to get to the ending.  The game uses the actual voices of the characters in the movie.  Tobey Maguire plays his role of Spiderman, Kirsten Dunst plays her character of Mary Jane, and Alfred Molina plays his part as Doctor Octavius/Doc Ock.  I haven't come across Doc Ock yet, but I did get to meet Doctor Octavius.  I'm not sure if James Franco played Harry in the game or not, but, so far, it doesn't sound like it.  I dunno.  But, the voices in this game are great.  So far I've completed a ton of missions, and there's still more to come.  I haven't even began to think about what lies ahead, because I know that there is going to be so much.  The only gripe I have about the game so far is that the camera kind of strides off a little bit sometimes, and that's not cool.  But, oh well, I'm over it.    Well, that's all I have to say about that.  For now, at least.  Later tonight, I'm going to begin posting my favorite ten episodes of Family Guy, with 10-6 tonight, and 5-1 tomorrow.  So, until then, I gotta get back to this game.  Adios!
