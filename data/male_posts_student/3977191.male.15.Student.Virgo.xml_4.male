(Lindsay is the hottie I work with) So I call up Andrew, One of my friends, to see if it was Okay with him because he was interested in her, because I know he was at one point. He says he "has Janine now, and what I do with lindsay is my business."    So I tell Lindsay it's cool. We decide to hook it up as a double date, so my Friend jeremy Takes his hot glow-stick chick of a girlfriend. So tonight I call Lindsay, tell her I'm going out tomorrow to buy em, among other things. So then she's like "Oh, you don't have to buy my ticket, it's not like we're going as dates or anything."    Well wasnt that a kick in the pants.  I wasted a perfectly good *real* date on her.  It makes me mad.    Then to make things worse, tonight, I was going out with a good(and also hot) coworker to see Napoleon Dynamite (Funniest Movie of all time, really) and she completely stood me up. She didnt answer her phone, and she didnt come by, I'm pissed man.    Then I'm going to warped with a friend, as a graduation present. Her Boyfriend hate my guts, Because I acted like an asshat a few months back, and I guess he Didnt get over it. So Now, I'm taking a girl to a concert, whose boyfriend hates me. Something tells me Rick isn't going to Like me anymore than he already does.
