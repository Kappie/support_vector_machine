Deen farm, tiny, free and took 2 hours and 30 mins to get to, and 1/2 an hour to get back, lol, well, back to Croydon. Was most fun =D  Thursday, lazy played alot of Warcraft with Dave (oh man, I'm sounding like  urlLink Jon  and Comand and Conquer) lots of stalemates and wasted time there.  And today.. much the same, but Alex from down the road came round, and we played south park, gauntlet legends and Sonic Shuffle =D most fun.   I haven't been able to get a good lie in all half term, the alarms I use for school somehow got turned back on, and we kept forgetting to turn them off, and this morning my neighbours decided to start putting up shelves first thing in the afternoon which of course meant loud hammering and such like, dammit, only 2 more days of half term.. ye-arr, I wanted to see Ashley tmz in Croydon, but can't.. dahh, hopefully next week I'll be free.
