I couldn't even get comments to work.   The point is, blogspots are addictive. I can imagine alot more time being taken up by this thing. I'm also currently pondering whether to change from .tk already, as the constraints of free domains are already starting to piss me off.  I saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban today. It's certainly the best of the three, and I like it even more due to my love of time-travel paradox, but it's still not all that good. Both Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and Emma Watson (Hermione Grainger) have improved massively as actors since The Philosopher's Stone, which is possibly the most overrated film ever. That ginger-haired guy is still crappy, though.  Positives: Lenny Henry, Dawn French, Gary Oldman, Jim Tavar√© and Robbie Coltrane. Negatives: That ginger-haired guy.
