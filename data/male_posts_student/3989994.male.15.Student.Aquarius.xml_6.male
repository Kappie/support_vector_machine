O but hey! one of the judges is our form teacher not to mention she's the chairperson! Oops...she's also the clever form who's helping our opponent? get a life...?  So it was english class when our team requested for sometime to make preparations not everyone enjoys standing in public only to be surrounded by laughter...She must be used to it by now though. But were we even for a moment considered? nope...  SO anyway who was actually going to listen to her, we just sat near one another with plans to discuss the topic while she wassted her time flashing slides after slides...Listen to her and u might contract brain cancer...  Tang: Why are you not copying? Student: I've got the answer correct. T: Really? but did you phrase it as I have? NO? then COPY IT DOWN! you obviously did not think of writting my version so there is room for improvements! S: huh?  Well ridiculous isn't it? But that is one of the milder audacities that we have to endure during her double periods of dictatorship...  As i was saying, we were huddled at the back, and then she insist on moving back to our seats.  ME: But we really do not have enuf time for the debate T: U shld solve that urslef Madhu: Cld we pls use this time, we cld catch up on the work from our friends. T: Nope, you plan to talk while i am teaching? M:u teach? or flash transparencies? and yes we plan to talk! T: Well then you might want to go outside. PPl in the class: Really, we can leave the class?  SO then she goes hysterical and all screachy...she even threathens to place ppl in detention for not putting on thier nametags....  Life would be simpler had she just died, but i don't want that. My life wld then be void of bitching! Stupid women.  I have half a mind to quit and leave the team in shit, madhu is considering as well, i wld love to see her stinking face on that day, it would probably be christmas early, i wonder whether her beautiful B-square wld be able to secure a win for them.   She's spoilt my day and ruined my mood she better not hope i don't see her, anytime soon i just my walk over and suffocate her with her own fats!~
