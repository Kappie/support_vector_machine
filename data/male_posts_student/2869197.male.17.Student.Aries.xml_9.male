One of the observing scientists explains, 'We were watching the last nueron die off when somehow it got a Circus Peanut. Then there were thousands...thousands of them! Then they escaped the skull and started attacking us. Nuerons just don't do that!'"  I've developed a love/obsession with Cirus Peanuts. These are the inch-long orange peanut-shaped pieces of pure sugar. By pure I mean concentrated until it forms a new phase of matter beyond solid, a super compact lattice structure of sugar. Some say they are too sweet. To these I reply, "Duh!" That's what they're supposed to be! Sugar! SUGAR! SUUUUUGAAAAAR!  The day started with my Mom calling First Presbyterian Church about Alma Youth Mix. She sounds impressed by what the pastor said which helps. The youth pastor seems to be on a break so she didn't learn enough to finalize, but it will be so. The deadline doesn't seem to be a problem anymore so I won't worry to much about that. Until tomorrow for my next attempts.  Then we went to Barnes and Noble, my dream house. Really, if I could live anywhere, it would be in the basement of a B  N, living off frappecinos and prepacked sandwiches. But that's just me.  I ended up buying three books: Party of One: The Loners' Manifesto by Anneli Rufus, Fast Food Nation by Eric Schosser, and Massage by Bernie Rowen. Fast Food Nation is for the Literary Review Club and I have to admit, it looks like a good one. The foreward about the Cheyenne Mountain military base and Domino's delivery made me drool. Massage I bought because I have been a little envious of people who give and receive casual massages. I want this power, and books can give it to me. I chose this one because it involves the least number of nude people (a positive for my mother as well) and was on sale (Dutch frugality strikes!). I ended up finding Party of One on that table by the little Starbucks. For those that don't even vaguely know me, I am rather a "loner" and it looks to be a great read.  The final occurance was collecting payment for my paperroute. This is that negative ending I was talking about. Now, the standard collection is always a drag, involving my ripping the green from my clients' icy grip. But this one happened at 7:00, in the cold, and after a fight with my mom over dropping some payments during a delivery. Not fun.
