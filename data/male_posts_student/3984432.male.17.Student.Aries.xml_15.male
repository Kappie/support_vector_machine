According to a recent statement from Kerry, even if he had known that Sadam did not have weapons of mass destruction, he still would have brought us to war JUST LIKE BUSH DID - in fact, Kerry states that he would have made all the choices that Bush made, including acting without UN sanction, but that he just would have made different wartime choices in the actual battles.  2 - DONT vote for Kerry because "he will work for the average American, not just the rich." Okay, here's a newsflash:  Kerry is rich, his biggest supporters are rich, and - just like every other politician in US history (including, I'll admit, Bush) - he's never going to do ANYTHING without at least a little consideration for those paying the bills.  Yes, Bush gave tax cuts to the rich, and gave less to "middle America."  But consider these two facts:  first of all, the rich (obviously) have a lot more money, so giving every million- and billionaire $100,000, for example, is the same percentage as giving a guy who makes $30,000 a year a grand back; second, Bush gave SOME money to the middle class, and tried to give even MORE, but guess who voted against it?  That's right, John Kerry.  Kerry voted AGAINST tax cuts for the middle class, even though now he's yelling at Bush for not doing it.  Plus, before you think that Kerry is really going to be a man "for the masses", remember that 99% of the entertainment industry (think Michael Moore, DMB, Michelle Branch, and the omni-present Susan Surandon/Tim Robbins duo) has come out to support John Kerry - and these are the richest 1% of the American people!  You can bet your ass that if Kerry really was going to play favorites any less to the wealthy than Bush would, America's richest wouldn't be showing Kerry their support.  Think about it.  3 - DONT vote for Kerry because "our economy is bad and he needs to fix it." America has just gone through the biggest job growth in US history.  The stock market is starting to go up.  Sure, the economy wasn't the best for a little while, but then again we had just gone through September 11th - an event that cost us $100 Billion, not including the wars in Afganistan or Iraq (and let's not forget that one of the reasons why the economy seemed so good in Clinton's time was that he SEVERLY cut defense spending - something that seemed to do us a damn lot of good in Fall of 2001, didn't it?)  Some people say that the economy is bad, and we need Kerry to fix it, but this simply isn't true.  There's nothing wrong with the economy.  Jobs are being created at historic levels, companies are all on rebounds, AND while oil prices are rising, the growth is considerably less, when taking into account inflation, than it has been many times over the past 35 years.  Here's another thing to ponder:  if Bush was not the way to fix the economy, why would every economic group in the US, including Wall Street, be backing him and his policies?  4 - DONT vote for Kerry because "he was a great soldier and knows about war." According to a new book, Unfit To Lead, in which more than 240 men who served in Viet Nam on the same watercraft as did John Kerry (including many in his unit) contributed, Kerry has lied time and time again about his war record, including where he served and what he did.  For example, he said that on Christmas day he was in a location that it would have been impossible to get to, and when pointed out this fact, Kerry said something along the lines of "oh, well maybe I didn't go there."  Sure, there are groups like Veterans for Kerry that support him, but these men did not serve with Kerry and many, including one of there top spokesman, didn't do anything war-related even close to what Kerry did, and so is about as useful a source as I am describing college-level physics.  Furthermore, an overwelming majority of our nation's veterans support Bush, and that certainly says something.  5 - DONT vote for Kerry because "he believes in what I believe in." To be honest, Kerry might believe in exactly what you believe in; the problem is that no one really knows for sure!  Kerry has been flip-flopping back and forth on almost every issue over the past few years, particularly since the campaign started.  Kerry says that he doesn't believe in abortion, but according to his voting record he has voted FOR abortion - in all sense of the word, mind you, meaning that he has voted for ALL abortions (including, therefore, late-pregnancy ones) - on dozens and dozens of occasions.  He says that he doesn't believe in gay marriage, yet he has voted FOR gay marriage many times and has supported Massachussetts's plan to make gay marriage legal.  So no matter where you stand on these or any issues, it's rather hard to tell if John Kerry is on your side or not!  Those are some reasons NOT to use in deciding to vote for John Kerry.  If you still have reason to do so, then by all means, give him your support.  But you'd best not vote for him for those reasons because - and probably many others - because they are not truths but are merely lies from the Kerry camp trying to steal away your votes.
