U know why it  WAS  about mike and Jorge? cause alot of people said shit behind there backs, but never to thier faces.  Now, i do admit, i might have said them alittle harsh (i was caught up in the moment) but what the fuck, the last thing i wanna do is to ruin the freindship.  I'm simply telling them in a non-confrontational way.  Imagin if i pointed out all that shit in front of them, in a group? Imagine how that feels? not to good huh? I find this the best way.  Cause that way, the person now knows what everyone is talking about, and the people talking can now be more honest.  And  once again  i  FUCKING SORRY  ok? i admit it, i know, some things shouldn't be said, but i believe i'm a  better  freind for saying it. Juss think about it, honestly, think about it.  I'm sorry for hurt feelings, for making you angry, for causing ANYONE any pain of ANY kind ok? I'm sorry Mike, I'm sorry Jorge,i'm sorry hernie, i'm sorry david, i'm sorry for everyone else who reads this fucking blog.  I never knew this would be such a fucking problem for everyone.  If you Haven't already caught  WHY  i'm writing about this is because of    urlLink David's Blog  regarding mine. I'm not pissed, i'm not sad, i'm not horney, i'm juss trying to clear up the truth cause theres ALOT of misunderstadings.  like the top says, i DUN HATE ANYONE, if anything, i love everysingle one of you guys, your closer than close...who else could i have male bonding sessions with at jones' house at like 5 o'clock in the morning with? where else could we sleep over and have no problems, where else can i joke around, be myself, and juss have fun? with you guys people, all i'm doing here is getting shit off my chest man.  The Valasquez thing, i felt bad for writing it, i really did, but i juss had to get it off, or else we juss would have kept on luaghing at him and shit, and he would never know why.  We would keep on talking to jorge, and he would always second guess shit, and think the worst.  I'm trying to help the best way i can.  I rather do it this way than face to face...atleast on shit like that.  And thats  definitly  not pussying out.  The issues i talk about aren;t bugging me to insanity, and i feel like killing the person thats doing it, or anything along those lines, theres juss the little thing that everyone knows except for them, thats all.  I'm sorry you rather do shit like that face to face davy-boy, but i also like putting myself in other shoes and acutally try to feel how that person would feel, and trust me, i have been at the end of  Countless  jokes before.  That having been said, i encourage  all of you  to just write what you wanna write about me, cause it looks like i'm public enemy number one for saying what everyone else thinks.  I have no problem with that, i juss want all of you to konw, that when i say something u think is negative about you, it's more than likely ALOT of people think the same way. so, let's recap... Everyone, i'm sorry, dun take this blog the wrong way, don't let digital fucking letters ruin years of freinship.  ok? are we done here? IM me if u got a problem, e-mail, do something, don't just tell me people.  Mike cleared up the arm thing. see, thats good, cause know i know the truth of why he does that, stright from him, and even though it might not be  true, i'm definitly not going to bother him about it anymore,jorge too got acouple of things clraed up with me, and were cool now too.  And as for the tell everyone abot my blog....total BS....i think the only 3 people i told was jones, david, and jorge, the rest juss either over heard, etc, etc.  Don't belive me? let's find out how mike, the only one still mad at me (and i guess with good reason) found out about my blog...

The only other thign u could say is i put the adress along with my "blog" away message, but who looks at my profile with out IMing me anyway? so there you go.  This part of the entry was designed to clear up davids blog, and to clear up everyone else's thoughts on mine. OK, now come on, no more about my fucking blog ok? I frankly dun care who reads it, so juss stop with the bitching and crying already...i admitted my mistakes like a man, and cleared everything up.  As for what happened today...Alot of shit happend. Yesterday, benny wanted to go to the palisades, and asked my andy, and Jorge while we were playing axis and allies.  andy said ya, i said maybe, jorge said most likely no....he said he would call us today at around 11 to see if we were going.  Now, starts today...i wake up at a lovely 10 o'cock and get told by my dad to get ready.  That would be the start of a crazy day.  My dad ends up letting my drive ALOT today...not the beemer, but the kick ass van, so we drive to subway first for brunch, then decide to go to Ciruit-city (i'm still driving...w00t). So on the way, my little bor calls, and dosn;'t wanna go (he won't be with us for the rest of the day and night), so we go without him.  We get there, and are looking at the Cd players for my car.  Now, lemme clear my whole car situation up....it's a fairly old car, 89' year model, so it's pretty old all around..and juss causxe it's mercedes dosn;t mean it's special or anything, which SUCKS, cause there-in lies the problem...i only have one little space thing for a CD player.  Now thats cool and everything, but i have a I-pod....and oviously, i wanna listen to it.  BUT, i can;t with out the tape adapter...and i'm definitly not gonna buy that    urlLink Irock  thing healey has...but looks like i'm gonna have to...let me explain.  Awhile back, we were looking for "the perfect" cd player for the car....many models made the grade, but only one won...the  urlLink KD-SX990  from JVC.  It looked, sounded great, PLUS, it had a MP3 input with COMPLETLY solved my problems, and it was SERIOUSLY cheap to boot.  The perfect one.  Anyway, i was gonna get it awhile back, but never did, and today was suppose to be the day we were gonna get it.  Well, we end up finding a used one for even CHEAPER, and but it.  We had a problem with not getting the maual cause they couldn't find it...but after this guy said we can print it offline, we decided to keep it.  I drive back home, were ready to get started....while my dad is getting his "machanic" clothes on, i'm outside, and decide to take it out, and put it on the trunk of my car...then, disaster struck....the way in which i was holding it, just a whole threw the bag, and fell ass-first on the concrete ground...i was fucking devastated...at first i thought it was all good, i tried to put it back together though...thats when i found out a little, tiny, insignificant peice of plastic had fallen off, and litterally turned the god sent cd player, to worthless trash.  My dad get outside, he;s obviouly upset, and we spend like an our looking for it in my driveway...which is MOSTLY little pebbles the same shape, color, and size of the piece missing...yeah, lost cause.  He get's over, and i kinda em, (we brought it back, got a full refund...suckers...) and them my mom comes home.  After that, sabby calls, tells me that everyone is at the mall, and i say i'll try and meet him up (cause at the time, i thought  was going to the palisades too).  anyway, we end up going to King Buffet, and spending another 2 hours there, where we meet up with my older bro, my sis-in-law, and there 2 freinds.  After that, we decide we wanna go to Woodbury Commons to buy us some stuff from the outlets....now lemme tell you, thats the cheapest fucking place for EVERYTHING, they litterally have EVERY stroe imaginable there, with EVRYTHING cheao ass fuck...i strongly advice everyone to go there.  Anyway, we would be there for the rest of the night...i didn;t see alot of the stores....mostly the clothing ones...and didn;t really find anything to my liking...i ended up walking into  urlLink Armani Exchange  with is basically cheaper uglier, dumb-downed versions of real armani.  as soon as i walk in, i'm scared....turns out, armani exchange is another way of saying "boy-toy spawning area". it was fuking SAD,  everyone had a tight shirt on, it was fucking ridiculous, i swear, i end up trying some shirts on, which i thought were pretty cool...but when i thought about it, it makes me look like a boy-toy wannabe, and it'll make everyone think i'm gay. So i didn't get anything from there.  We go around some more, bla,bla,bla, and end up going into the Tommy HIlfiger store...now THAT is my store...there shit is kick ass....if i had more moeny, i'm sure i would have spent well over 300 bucks on that place, there shit is the best....well, ya, i bought 2 shirts, and went home.....now i'm here, still homeworkless, and wrting this blog.  I talked to sabby alittle earlier, turns out Ben, Andy, Sab, Hernie, his little bro, and his bro's freinds had a blast...sorry i couldn't be there.....well ya, so thats about it...i have another new fav. song to add to my top 10 fav. song of the moment....George Micheal - Faith....and ya, i know the fuck is gay, but that sure as hell dun make me gay, thank u very much....well, ya, so that was the day in a nutshell....now, if you'll excuse me....i have time to waste....
