Yes, today I was chosen quite randomly to be interviewed. It seems to be a matter of stating the obvious ['so your good at maths and your taking economics... have you ever thought of being an accountant?']. Eventually I decided that I would make out that engineering would be the career for me so she wouldn't have to continue guessing jobs for me - the plan seemed to work as the interview was concluded fairly quickly after that.  4 Days until the end now; I had two random second or third years [they all look so alike] randomly scream in my face today. Perhaps it’s a hormone thing, I don't know but I remember not doing it to year 11s when I was a little second year. They should have more respect for their elders!
