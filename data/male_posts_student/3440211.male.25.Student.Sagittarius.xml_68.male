In that week of absolute coma ended up with my girlfriend breaking up with me. If that is the only way she can have me react it has been pretty bad. I know that she loves me and I love her too its just a question of patience. But oh my lord that coma was needed. Justa couple of more weeks and we will be toghether again. In the meantime a friend of mine will pop over. Really looking forward to that have to admit. It can be fun.  I will miss my girlfriend until then...
