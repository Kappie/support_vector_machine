I ran it through him and he thinks it a pretty odd idea:   1) Weekly Car Drive with Vito- Something that happens in the car when I am driving each Firday. We can always find something funny there. (Come up with a better name later)   2) Eating at Coldstones and/ or Quiznos and put down what happens there once in a while. There might be something funny.   3) A scene once in a while taking place in either the following of some ones house: Cory's house, Ryan's House, Jeff's House, Cameron's House, for good measure any one's house.   4) Some damn random funny scene in some damn random place, this once has mucho potential *wink wink* ;-).  I am going to draw up some of the scenery stuff for you guys to see or some one else is going to get there before me. Stupid time...when will time go backwards so I can have more fun :-D!
