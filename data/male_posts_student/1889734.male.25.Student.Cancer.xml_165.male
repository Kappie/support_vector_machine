He reads out excerpts from articles and reports featuring SUV violence. The thing that makes these special is that the SUV is always treated as the active participant in the violence. The SUV is itself a killer. The driver of the SUV is not to blame, just the evil SUV. And almost all the stories mention the SUV's make and model.   The reason this is both funny and alarming is that the media elities think that SUV's are a problem, and are a source of injustice in this world. They cause accidents, kill people, use too much gas, cost too much, etc. So when an accident or crime features an SUV, it must be the SUV's fault, at least in part.
