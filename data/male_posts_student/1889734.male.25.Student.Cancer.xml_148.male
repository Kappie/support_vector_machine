We got her to the doctor and he then rushed us to the ER.  He feared meningitis.  So after a full day in the ER with a spinal tap and other tests, Diane is now home.  She's fine, but still pretty sick.  Seems like some uber-flu.  So I will be out all day on Friday as well.  If anyone wants to send me something Blog related, please mail to Todd@wiley-consulting.com  I'll see you on Monday.
