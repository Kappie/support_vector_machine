Included in that pile were a leather love seat, a chair, and a matching ottoman, all invaluable items for a poor grad student who will need to furnish an apartment in another month.    So, with the help of my roommate I emulated my good buddy Fred and pillaged the dumpster pile.  I am very happy with my latest accusitions, and will continue to keep a hawkish eye on the junk heap in case anything else of interest is added.
