Right now I hate where I live which also happens when I spend too much time here. Ugh. Gets on my nerves. Apparently my parents have changed the meaning of the word "garage" from a place you put a car to a place to put a whole lotta crap. My house is too small also.  Complaining because I'm bored, depressed, lonely, and need to get out of this fucking place. Hopefully I get that job.  There is really nothing on TV. Ever. Alot of shit that gets replayed over and over again.  How many days till college? Oh. That many? Damn!  I need to get the oil changed on my car.  ...
