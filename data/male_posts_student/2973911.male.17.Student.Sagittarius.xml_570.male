Picture the new uniform of UNC. White blouse. Light grey skirt. Blood red tie. Everytime we see the uniform, we cringe at the sight. Actually, it's a joke in the university that UNC doesn't have a uniform. It's got a multi-form. We have the old one with the grey tie. The new one with the red-checkered skirt and pants. *We look like we're wearing table cloths, in that one* And the new and improved red tie with grey pants or skirt. They keep changing the design to keep up with the times except they don't come close. Bleh!  Yep! I've been busy. I don't really understand it but there are days when I just find myself shoulder-deep in assignments. How unfair is it when two different teachers give you reports for the same day? The day when you have a long assignment for another class. While you have to study pages of Law and Tax. Ok, I'm complaining. Not good of me. Basta! I'm swamped. Feeling the need to study. Nagi-guilty kasi ako sa chika ng kaklase ko. May sinabi kasi ang Dean. Di ko na isulat rito at baka kung  may makabasa pa. Masobrang obvious na chismosa ako.
