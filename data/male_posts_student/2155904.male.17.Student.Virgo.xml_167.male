Tyke got up about 12:30 and already there was a game of bball set up at 2 at Amed's house.  So Tyke, Amed, Maniak, Macaroon, Piggy J, Kcaj, and Jew played and when they got there some asian senior guys from Newport were playing on half the court.  So Tyke and the crew went and played on the other court.  A little after they started shooting around the asians asked Tyke's gang if they wanted to play and Tyke said no.  They asked again and Tyke kept saying no and that they did not want to play them so it didn't matter how much they asked.  Tyke was forceful in his answer (which may have made them mad).  As Tyke's game was going on in half the court the Newports decided they were going to play a full court game through the game that was already going on.  There were some confrontations that arose from this because of Tyke making a lay-up and landing on one guy incidentally so Tyke got pushed but he didn't back down because there was no reason to.  Nothing physical really broke out that time though.  Some other guys got pushed too but nothing escalated.  Tyke's crew kept playing their game and finally the Newports got tired of it and they just stopped playing full court so Tyke's gang won that battle.  Later on though one of the Newport fags came over and picked up Macaroon's ball off the ground and kicked it up and over the fence into the woods.  As was the dumbasses' luck, the ball rolled all the way back down to the fence that was outlining the court so they didn't have to go very far to get it.  Tyke started clapping for the guy who kicked it a la Sanders class and the rest of the gang chimed in and gave a rousing ovation for the class act that was this monstrously gay man.  He smiled of course and walked around like he was the shit.  A little bit later he decided he would go back for another of the basketballs.  This time it wouldn't work.  He went to kick it but Maniak wouldn't have any of that and went over to grab and protect the ball from it being kicked.  The shrimpy asian guy got pissed, jumped up and hit Maniak on the top of the head like a hammer and then he hit him at least once in the left eyebrow/temple area.  Maniak started to bleed but he didn't fight back which was smart.  Piggy J and Amed returned the punches with verbal assaults but nobody hit back.  Tyke was unfortunately going to get the ball so he was just outside of the court as it began to take place so he ran back down and backed up his buddies but at this point the asian guy was just yelling "You can't touch me, don't even touch me, you can't touch me.  I like men."  Well that last part Tyke added but he might have said that.  Maniak decided, with the approval of most of the other players, to call the police and report the incident for it was legally assault.  Tyke got out his phone and Amed called the Bellevue police up and said everything that needed to be said.  Tyke and the crew decided to let the Newports play their full court game now as it meant that they would stay around while the cops came.  The cops came and they took Maniak's statement and got him checked out by EMT's.  Then they talked to the assaulter and got his story.  The cops got the story from both sides and did their little thing.  It took quite a while for this whole thing to happen.  Tyke for some reason never got questioned which he was disappointed about cuz he wants to be involved cuz he was pretty pissed and wasn't going to take any more of the other guys' shit.  He just is like that.  He may not really be able to defend himself but he'll try for sure.  As two of the Newport guys were leaving they said something to Tyke and Amed and the guys sitting around and Amed said what back.  Then they started yelling and swearing again at the guys and then is when the public got involved.  Since this is a public park there had been kids and parents around the entire time who may have been a witness to the events.  One mother, upon the loud cussing from one of the asian guys, yelled back at the kid and called him immature, etc to which he had no real response.  He then left and that was that.  Tyke went over to the woman and apologized for the inconvenience but she said that it wasn't his fault the other guy was a jerk.  The gang then waited around for Maniak to give his written statement and the assaulter to be escorted to his riced out car and leave under his own power.  The cops told Maniak that nothing would be done now but the report will be filed and if the guy is arrested a prosecuter can take the case if he/she wants.  So basically he is getting screwed by his being a head case his whole life.  Maniak came back and the gang played some bump before heading off to Eastgate for slurpees.  Then Tyke left and came back home.  Tyronious, Macaroon, and Kinker came over at like 9.  Tyronious brought with him a picture of his Eastside FC team from some years back.  Kramm and BNelly were on it but so was the kid who assaulted Maniak.  Tyronious told him some facts about the kid that just further proved what kind of a guy he is.  So he is just retarded.  Basically though, today was an awesome day.  The whole cop thing was interesting and proved that white boys fight back.  And it also proved that cell phones are useful.  And not fighting back.  Oh yeah, the cop also told Maniak that the Newport guys stories didn't match up so the cops knew they were lying.  This was just a great day and tomorrow is Easter and is going to be a lot of fun.  Refuge should be awesome and so should the after time.  Good times.  Good times.
