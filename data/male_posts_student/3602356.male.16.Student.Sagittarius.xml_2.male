As far as I'm concerned, this my way of talking to myself without looking like a complete schizo.  So, who am I?  My real name is Simon. Yes, it is, believe it or not. I live in Australia. I'm in what I hope to be my last year of high school. I call myself the sax man because I'm a muso, or at least I hope to be. Guess what I play. If you can't guess, read my nickname. If you still can't guess, go outside and read some books.  Next year, I want to go to the Sydney conservatorium of music. I may or may not fail my HSC, I don't care. I'm sick of school because of incompetent teachers and ignorant administration.  For the moment, I don't care. High school, for me, is a waste of time, much like blogging. The time I use doing study could be better used practicing. Hopefully, in blogging, I'll be able to express what I think.  Probably not. It's bound to be a load of crap.
