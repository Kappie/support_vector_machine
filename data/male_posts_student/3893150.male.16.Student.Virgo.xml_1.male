I personally think it started with Super Mario Bros. 2. what a fucking trip, you have to be a savante to finish that game, without going insane, that is. but it's true. the worst thing we had as kids was Mortal Kombat. nowadays, kids have The Suffering, Manhunt, Max Payne, GTA. certainly not bad games, but still..kids are getting desensitized...which isn't a good thing. but whatever, I'm sounding a little too grizzled for a 16 year old. later that night, we met up with my other friend Farrell (Andrew) and played some water frisbee, sans Devon. good times. for the next three minutes, I have to help my dad with our cabin..it's finally getting taken off the stilts it's been sitting on for 12 years and put in a foundation. so I'll be working on that until saturday evening. it's my punishment for not having a job. better than flipping greasy cowheads all day I guess. I guess thats it for now.
