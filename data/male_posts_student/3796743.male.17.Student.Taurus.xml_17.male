I don't really know either. It used to be in a storage lot, now its in my driveway. Whatever. so, like where the refridgerator (sp?) is in the trailer there is like a vent thing on the outside. So about two weeks ago I noticed yellow jackets going into the trailer. We told my dad and he said he noticed that A MONTH ago but didn't think anything of it. So we call the exterminator and he says there is a HUGE nest in there cause its been a month. So yeah today he came and killed em all. Go Bee Men! Ya gotta heart them!  So back to Canada. This could be a really long blog today, but you all deserve it because I haven't posted a decent blog for a while. So Canada. We woke up at 5.30 in the morning and took off at about 7. I had to do my hair, this is why the delay. Anyways, we finally got up there at like 11 and basically drove right over the border. Apparantly the Canadians don't believe in security at all. The guy was like Hi, *glances at passports*, then says "Have a good trip". Well that was easy. Don't worry, we made up for it coming back into America. More on that in a bit. So the original plan was to spend the night in Vancouver, but as we quickly noticed, Canada sucks! There is nothing to do but shop, and while I can shop for weeks, we decided just to shop for one day. So we left the same day at about 4. Anyways after arriving we quickly located a large shopping mall (Pacific Center) I respelled Center because that is how its spelled. Don't even argue with me on that one. We shopped for several hours. I went to the Gap, which had all the same clothes as in America except it smelled funny. So I quickly left that dump. Then I located the Roots store, which I don't often shop at. I've bought online before, but I bought a sweatshirt. Its very cool. We also went to the pharmacy in Canada. They have Allegra over the counter and 222's. 222's are fun, and illegal. We didn't know that until we tried to cross the border back home when we were informed we were committing a felony. Yikes! Not fun. But everything turned out okay. So if you want the details you gotta ask me. Ummm....so today I did pretty much nothing. Except I had lunch at El Sarape and saw my hair stylist there. She was sitting in the booth right next to us! That is pretty exciting. What else.....I got nothing. So thats all for today kids. Remember that persons's profile I was talking about the other day. Well heres another quote from it. Have a good night all....  "Understand that happiness is not based on possessions, power, or prestige, but on relationships with people you love and respect"  Till Later
