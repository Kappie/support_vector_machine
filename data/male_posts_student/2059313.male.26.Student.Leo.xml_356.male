For I spent all o' me tin, with the ladies drinkin' gin... and across the western ocean I must wander."  That song is off a Traditional Irish group's CD called MOLLY'S REVENGE.  I bought that CD two years ago on Saint Patrick's day out in California while visiting Stephanie on my spring break.  Since then we've kept up the tradition by going to an Irish Pub on St. Patty's day.  Sadly, this year may be different as she may not get to go.  One a lighter note - I got to see a really awesome Irish Band out of Canada called Slainte Mhath (pronounced Slawncha Va) yesterday on campus.  Check out the photoblog on the sidebar to see 'em.  They blend traditional Irish music with modern beats and songs.  The actually played, "That's the way I like it" yesterday... it was too cool.  And of course, there's a girl in the band, and she was HOT.  She plays the fiddle and this traditional Irish-type drum - it kind of looks like an oversized tamborine without the little cymbals all around it.  I think I'm destined to be with someone who - on the lowest level - really enjoys music a lot, or - to the hightest level - plays an instrument, sings like an angel, or totally gets wrapped up in the emotion of a song and sees the things in music that I do.  Instruments and voices for girls just really turns me on, I guess.
