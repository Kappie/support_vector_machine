To respond to comments, Kevin helped me get rid of the A thing, and I changed "Melo" to "Melody" (and "Duke" to "Loren" while I was at it).  I'm glad I'm getting such good response, with the exception of Hiro, who uses IE for Macs which sucks suckily.  I aced the math test, which I started yesterday.  Mr. Stanley said he liked my QEDs, I always make an effort stylizing them.  Next test I'll make cartoons with them if I remember.  Mme. DeRobert etait malade aujourd'hui, donc, je passerai l'examen du Petit Prince au moins six jours apres la reste de la classe.  Mange-le.  Oh and I also did quite well on the chemistry test, given that I didn't study at all and all of the material was taught when I was absent, plus I didn't have a calculator (someone had taken it while Ms. Srikanth was borrowing it).
