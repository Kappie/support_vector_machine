Wait, let me rephrase that -- when there's nothing that you  want  to do. I have tons of games downstairs that I could (and probably need to) play, but I just don't really want to right now.  I know that I didn't post yesterday, mainly because nothing all that eventful ever happens on a Sunday. My day pretty much consisted of going to church, eating lunch, and playing FFXI. Not all that interesting to talk about.  Granted, today hasn't been much more interesting. Wake up, go eat lunch, and then come home and post this. Yeah, that's been about it. Now it's time to go try and find something to entertain myself...
