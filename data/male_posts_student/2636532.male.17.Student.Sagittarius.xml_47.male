Well ok… about an hour after, but I needed to eat and do some other such essential things such as posting (yes I put that there just for you Lou). But right after I actually started my homework! I shut off all my messengers… well a couple of them were on away, but they always are anyway. What did I manage to do? Well I got my scanner working, cropped a few pictures, wrote out exactly half of my autobiography and then managed to get up half a section on the web site. So no matter what I'm screwed because I still have about 60% of that project to do, 2 tests tomorrow and a couple units I have to hand in for various subjects. Plus because most of the world is stupid, we lose an hour. I could actually maybe get an hour of sleep tonight, but noooo…. We need to let that go to waste. I don’t even understand why we do it anyway. I mean we didn't do it when I was in Japan, so I didn't gain that extra hour because they don't feel like doing it, so I basically lost an hour there too. Ack whatever. All I know is school sucks and I can't wait till I leave it. Even this one time I waste a whole Saturday doing homework it helps me none since I still have about 3 days of homework pilled into one day since teachers are cruel.  - Dark Lily  0>--}----
