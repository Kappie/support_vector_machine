We hit up a club called Cargo and a few bars along the way (Bedroom bar, Cafe Kick and Medicine).   I am the only one in the wedding party from the states to arrive. The AEP frat bros are set to be here in 2 days. Party? Fuck yeah. I fucking love England. Went with the happy couple to the Claverley Hotel, where the reception will be held. When I inquired about the cost of this soiree, Cody gave me a nod and said, "4x more then your Yale education for the next 2 years." Parents are paying so why not think big? Dinner at the reception is $60 a head with over 500 people in attendance.   They are taking me sight seeing today, after we sleep a few winks. I've been here before but that was years ago. The bachelor party is pegged for July 12. Cody's future brother-in-law, Ari, has the whole shindig planned. I have my tux fitting tomorrow, afterwards we will be once again hitting the circuit.   My time in California was spent with April. I took her out to dinner twice. It seems that we do not share the same affection for foreign fare. The idea of there being an "us" has been exhausted. It's best to have her as a friend then nothing at all. She is amazing, even if she hates French, Indian and Jewish food. The woman is a diamond in the rough.    Since when did I indulge in cliches and popular sayings? I'll blame the alkie. Got to  get some shut eye so we can party it up tonight.
