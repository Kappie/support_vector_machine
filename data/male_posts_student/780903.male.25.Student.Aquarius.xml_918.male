Nothing changes here; I'm honored to have been asked to stick around over there, and their ever-growing cast of excellent contributors means that I get the low-pressure privilege to post only when the mood strikes and not just for the sake of seeing my name in bright orange.  So when something I read over there sparks something, I'll probably post a thought.  But I'll flag anything of note, and, of course, this is still the home base.  No worries.  Incidentally, stay tuned for some news about En Banc: The Next Generation in the next couple of days.
