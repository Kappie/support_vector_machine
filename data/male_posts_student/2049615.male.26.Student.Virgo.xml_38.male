The only TV I watch is prerecorded episodes of Law  Order, courtesy of friends with cable, so all this means is that it came out after say 1999.  That said, I doubt it gets aired on TV.  I saw it at the local multiplex, and various clues indicate that it is probably intended exclusively for that context.  The advertisement appears to be shot in Cinemascope.  It does not suffer from the odd distension or cropping that mark TV crossover ads, such as the Celine Dion Chrysler spot or the innumerable interchangeable Mountain Dew ads.  The action virtually spills out from around the spot's centerpiece, a telegenic young black singer.  As soon as this woman starts to sing, it becomes clear both from the structure of the melody and the simple fact of her unaccompanied singing that this is a Coca-Cola spot, part of the series whose first iteration was the venerable "I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing".  The surface message of that spot as well as this and all the others in between is essentially that guileless young people are going to improve the world with their enthusiasm and idealism, whilst drinking Coke.  The form has arguably found its apotheosis in this latest attempt.  The frame is composed such that the singer is always in the center of the frame and larger than life, while the people, ostensibly citizens of New York City, with whom she interacts fall into and fade out of view as she passes by them.  The singer appears magnified, and her every facial expression is likewise magnified.  Her range of expression however is profoundly limited:  varying between vulnerable innocence and quasi-cosmic wisdom, she could not have forced more boundless love for audience through the camera and into the theater had she used some sort of tool.    Wandering through downtown, she passes out old-school tall glass Coke bottles and meaningful gazes.  One or the other, or the combination, apparently induces life-changing epiphanies in the recipients.  The most priceless expression is on the face of the first one, a young businessman with a trendy haircut.  The amount of treacle is staggering.  It is so staggering that I almost started to wonder whether or not the director of the spot was deliberately going overboard in an attempt to satirize the "Coke and Idealism" ad genre.  Before that, however, I realized that there was no need to wonder:  this was certainly the case.  It is now a given that advertisements, particularly those aimed at young college-educated or collegiate adults will include a degree of self-referentiality or -deprecation to reassure the marketing-savvy that they have indeed seen an advertisement, how hokey, right?  but you're clever, you're cool, you're in on the joke.  Ultimately the content of an advertisement is window dressing.  Advertisements promote sales mainly by notifying consumers of the simple existence of a product;  the presence of actors or context for the product to identify it with or assign it to the use of a particular demographic or socioeconomic class is basically a shortcut around the step in which you go down to the carlot and discover you can't afford a Lexus.  Back to our ad.  The way in which the director has seen fit to restore some credibility to this ad, to let all us hip young 'uns in on the joke, to let us know that yep, wow, it's an ad! is to take the sentimentality inherent in this type of Coke advertising to an obscene degree.  The tight focus on the singer's face, her earnest demeanor, even her neo-soul clothes and vocal stylisms are all meant to stand in for sincerity, as they currently do in the media in general.  Everybody in the ad, once their lives are touched by the Coke Lady, is clearly resolving to live life in a better, simpler way.  But with Coke.  The cognitive dissonance induced when one realizes that a visual rhetoric of idealism is being used to shill for materialism is nearly disorienting.  The idea that someone could watch this ad and  not  be struck by the degree of cynical manipulation it entails is ridiculous.  Essentially what this ad represents is the total dominance in the professional ad world of the "ironic in-joke" trope.  It has now joined the legion of tricks advertisers use to try to sell things to people who think they're above such things.  In this, it has discredited itself.  Wow, again with the no clicking.  Well then, time for more  urlLink funny .
