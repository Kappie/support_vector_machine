This is the year that counts as far as college goes. This is the start of the downward spiral, the "initiation into adulthood" the is a staple of our society. I say fuck that. Look, I'm not gonna lie to myself, I'm not going to have many, if any, allies in this. From here until I die, my contemporaries will continue to assume more responsibilty, become dryer and dryer people, eventually end up shuffling papers in some high paying corporate job. Fuck that. I will always refuse responsibility. We were born free of it because thats how we were meant to be. I refuse to put human emotion, human desire, in the backseat to what's the "right" thing to do. There is no RIGHT thing to do except what you dictate is right for yourself! Yes, I realize that one by one my friends will become my enemies because of this. Regardless of what you may say to me, you will eventually dislike my company bexause of how "childish" or "selfish" you will find me. Yes, I realize that this line of thought prevents money, or respect, but it's how i feel damnit. I will not... no, I can not become a 30 or 40 something year old who cares more about stupid fucking tasks or figures than about following my curiosity, appeasing the thirst for what I wish to learn or do. I've always had a deep gut feeling that I'm not meant to ever find someone to have a relationship with. I think this is probably why.  In summary: - 99% of you will eventually bend to society's will, I will not. - You will find me to be childish, selfish, uncouth. - I don't give a fuck.  Respectfully your enemy, Mike Garvey
