Why am i so happy?! haha... erm... cause, i guess... i saw Cherie today! heex... yup, was really happy lah, spent some time with her and i guess, things are progressing lah! However, i am not going to say how and will not go into the details, it's only for her and me to know lah ah! haha... Heex.. Bleah... so happy!  Anyway, going to keep this entry really short lah, but certainly have to address some issues and problems in my life.  1st: Chris, i have a feeling that you are angry with me. Though i don't really have any clear idea as to why, but i can pretty much guess that it would most likely be related to Kelly lah. I don't know, at least you give me that impression. Well, i won't deny that alot of the things that has happened shows this view and conception fo me that i don't like, but at least, i prefer it than to release the whole truth and stuff lah. Yeah, but i really hope that you would tell me anything if you are unhappy with me cause you're a very close friend to me that i guess, i don't really want us to have any problems relating with each other. Yeah cause, i guess, we have a friendship that i would like to keep for life, but with the way things are going, it's going to be hard. So yeah, just tell me if there is anything wrong lah, and i hope that after 4 long years of friendship, you can actually just be honest with me.  2nd: To Kelly, i don't know... But i guess, there is this sudden awkwardness between us in terms of interacting lah. Yeah well, i don't know, but i guess, it bothers me lah... Yeah... You're a really special friend to me and i don't really like the way things are going so i do hope that you can at least tell me if there is anything long. So please, do tell me if there's a problem lah...  3rd: To all my classmates, i am sorry that i stepped down as class representative, though i know that some people are just faking their concern, but i do recognise those that honestly are concern and i thank all of you. Yup, i guess, there are many reasons as to why i stand down lah. 1 is cause of the election of me becoming the VP of Chinese Orchestra (CO) and well, i want to concentrate more on that CCA. 2 is that i think others deserve a chance to get the points and stuff lah. 3 is that i guess, i don't really click with the class cause with the responsibilities and stuff, i try to keep away and keep to myself from everyone so now, i hope to be more of myself. Yup... so yeah... Thanks for the support of everyone that has helped me and been a friend to me...  ok... so ends the addressing, however i hope that everyone be optimistic and Live Life To The Fullest! heex... Cherie, i think you know what i want to say lah... :P
