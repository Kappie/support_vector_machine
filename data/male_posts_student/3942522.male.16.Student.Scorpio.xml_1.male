Oh god, I am lack of time and sometimes I really hope there are 36 hours a day.. So thatI can sound sweet longer and no longer morning sun could bug me to wake up... My exams are around the corner and is no longerrelax as before.. It would be fine if there are 1000 days a year so that I could enjoy youth.. :p But I could dream no more and face my reality.. Its been quite long ever since I have enjoy.. But I will make sure I will play hard once this torment is over... Well, fun in studying is still existing to me as I really enjoy passing my time with it.. Moreover, I am not afraid of any subjects anymore because I have adequate skills in all of them.. Awwww, I missed my primary school days suddenly !! Maybe because I have been stressing myself all along but I really hope to go back to the days where I do not have headaches.. Turning the time back, I remember the scene and image when I am so childish !! Oh my god !! It's really embarrassing for me to even think of it let alone still having the attitude.. However, it is quite cute and I even smile to myself for that.. *Sigh* Those were the days while time is travelling and here I am ageing.. I could dream no further and hope that I could be climb up into another level through this test..
