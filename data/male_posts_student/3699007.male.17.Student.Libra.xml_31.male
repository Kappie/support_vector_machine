So, thanks to all the great folks who defend the best nation ever.  34 years ago today, Jimi Hendrix played one hell of a show at the Atlanta Pop Festival.  Just a useless fact.  Anyway, this weekend has been relatively dull.  Yesterday (Saturday-I'm sure the 2 AM entries are confusing as to what day I mean when I say yesterday) I finally went to guitar center and got strings so I can play again.  $12 for 12 packs...not bad.  I should have gotten 24 for $24.  Then I came home and watched the race.  Yes, NASCAR is a guilty pleasure of mine, been watching it forever and if I am a redneck for doing so, so be it, but I enjoy racing.  I don't have a mullet and I don't wear blue jean shorts so I think that disqualifies me from being a redneck.  I'm just a "suthuna".  So yeah that's all I did yesterday, and today we got up and went and ate breakfast and Waffle House.  The All-Star breakfast is awesome.  Then, I came home and did nothing all afternoon and now here it is 6:05 and I would guess I'm not doing anything tonight either, unfortunately.  Fireworks are badass and I don't have very many to blow up and didn't feel like going to South Carolina to get more.  It's been raining, so at least I can't catch anything on fire.  I swear it rains every day.  I wanna go to the Gwinnett Glows thing.  Well, not actually up by the courthouse itself because the traffic is horrible, but go sit somewhere and watch the fireworks, but I'm sure my parents will be anal about it, just like most other things.  Anyway, I'm out...gonna go find something else to do.  Happy 4th!
