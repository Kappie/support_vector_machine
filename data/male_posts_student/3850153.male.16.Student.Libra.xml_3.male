Seeing Eric Clapton live is like every good  thing in this world condensed into musical form. Its difficult to place  into words the way that man produces sound. There's no sense in even  trying, you have to hear it to believe it. "Layla" in particular  is impossible to compare to recorded versions. When you see the guitar  work up close its a completely different song. Absolute beyond  comprehension. Other developments this week:   -Summer TOK started: generally good. The hours are terrible but, I'm  glad this meansI have zero chance of having the class with Saxsma.   -I saw "Anchorman": below "Dodgeball" in quality but I liked Tim Robbins as the Public TV guy.   -Also saw "Napoleon dynamite" with Aggie, Mona, and Blair: weird film,  but hilarious (I still don't get the part about the "delicious bass").   -Doobie Brothers tickets arrived: concert should be good.    -And I discovered "When I Paint My Masterpiece" by The Band and found it to rival "The Weight" in terms of overall quality.
