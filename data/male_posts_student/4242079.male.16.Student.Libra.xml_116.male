I promise I'll get all the links working, and some content of some sort in the columns. Any suggestions, anyone? So tonight, I'm supposedly going to Edwards to watch a movie. I'm sure it'll be a rocking time. Although I don't know if I really want to look at a screen for two more hours. This computer has only left my lap for a few seconds to go to the bathroom since I got home at around 4 o clock this evening. Disgusting I say.  I have nothing to say, and the only purpose of even posting tonight was to point out the new template to you guys. I know how observant some of you are sometimes;). But seriously. Any content suggestion would be appreciated.
