My posts.. I know get boring.  Maybe that has something to do with no one visiting.  Right now I'm talking to my good friend from Ohio.  His name is Evan.  He's a good guy.  It's really too bad that I had to move.  It's weird though because right now I've known him longer online than in real life.  It's been about 4 years since I last saw him.  It's crazy that we even talk at all.  Anyways I just saw the new Dave Matthews video... "Gravedigger"  It's pretty cool... but weird.  I don't have anything else to say.  I sitll have homework left which sucks.  Oh well... homework does suck!  Blah blah blah...
