I suppose that we will let their roots rest for a bit.  WE ARE NOT ANTISOCIAL.  We are not slackers, perverts or anarchists - well maybe one is, but she moved.  We exist for you of course.  Sometime, take a look at our constitution.    Briefly, I might explain that roads are too long, straight and distant from the houses.  No, I don't like the noise of traffic, but no one does really.  That is of course, no one who has not been polluted enough by cars that he/she cannot remove him/herself from toxic environs.  Listen, all we have to do is make the streets tighter, but have ample room to walk along the sides.  Make loads of busroutes and heaps of buses and basically by way of conjestion, outlaw cars.  How many times does just one person fit themselves into a car (pollution included) and hop down to the nearest (what I mean by near is in American terms - one block and everyone else - within a kilometre or two) store, laundry etc and use their four-wheeled smoker?  Too often.  Constrict the width of the roads and do away with killing-your-kids'-futures that are driven by nearly everyone.  In fact, you may even discover that those two fat stumps below you are worthy to move you from place to place and don't cost a yen, pense, ora, penny to operate.    However, here is the hypocratic moment... if I met a girl with a car, well... that would be nice. :)  what?  not a soon-to-be-mush rant/blog?!  dear no, from this moment on i will not even use capital letters if I can remember to not.  Or ... i mean... or we could slice the rest of the world's cars and lories in half like in japan.  I've given up on this whole small letter business.  Hmm... there seems to be a bit of nonsense packed in here.  Wil...l... have... to work...it OuT... nuff      said.. ... .. .
