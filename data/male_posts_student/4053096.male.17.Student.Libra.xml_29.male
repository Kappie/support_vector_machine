Bon and I are watching a movie; Bourne Identity. It was a pain in the butt to find. First I went to a couple places. The first place was so disorganized it was pathetic. Then the next place had it, but all copies were rented. Then I got back home, and thought of another place, but Karen wouldn't let me go. She didn't want me to use the gas when I could just call them. So then I had to go and find the place in the phone book, and call. Well, they're number was "unable to be reached" or something along those lines. Well, finally Karen found a place that had it. But you have to be 18 or older to rent or get a membership thingy, so then we had to work out a plan to get it. yeah. It was rather a pain. But now we're going to get the movie, and Bon and I are going to watch it, and it'll all be good. Well, that's all for now.
