It taught me alot of things that usually aren't taught.  It taught me about life and death.  It taught me about lifein general.  I know it may only be a book, but it showed me overwhelming happiness and sadness.   Today, I discoverd that if you eat a potatoe and then leave the plate with the crumbs on it, it hardens like a rock!  Wow, I guess you learn something new everyday!   I didn't go to the YMCA today for a few reasons.  One is that I slept in, but that is because I told my mom I am not going to the Y today.  Another is I am tired of devotiong myself to something so dead-end and uncaring.  The people are great, but I don't think I really want to work for LIT any more, where I pay them to work Nine to Five...but don't get paid!  I do more work for the Y then any Bus boy/bag boy prick so I to should get paid some or at least not have to pay them!  And it turns out that out of the eight of us, I am the only one to pay full price!  A few didn't pay at all and some were on "Y Welfare" or whatever the hell that is.
