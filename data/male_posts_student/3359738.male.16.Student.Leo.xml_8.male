My name is Alan. I live in Spain though I wasn't born there. I'm 16, if you care to know.     My education?   I've always been to English schools all my life, which explains my English skills. The UK educational system rules by the way. Anyway, I'm in what they call "Year 12". I forgot what's the first year. (Six, I think.) Year 13 is the one before I go to uni. I have finished my Year 12 and am in a period of exams for this and next month. (That reminds me, I have an English Language exam coming up on Tuesday and should probably study instead of writing this.) The subjects I chose were (in no particular order) English Language, Art, IT, Biology. Although I'm not a bad student, my previous year's results weren't too good -- mostly C`s. The choice of subjects was a little tough because the rule was that a student only fails the year if he fails over 4 subjects (which is crazy) and can only enter into subjects next year if he has a B or higher. I only had one B and one A (in Spanish, which is excruciatingly boring to study as it's my native tongue), but I also hadn't failed enough subjects to get kicked out, so they made an exception. It turns out that GCSE/IGCSE grades aren't required to enter into AS level, and is merely a matter of the school, or should I say, the teachers. I got accepted into the subjects I liked which I had previously done. The only one I hadn't done before, which I asked to get into, was Art (and it's quite fun, I must add). (I've done pretty damn good on Art. More on that later.) Hopefully I'll pass this year and get into the next, and hopefully do very good on that, then get into a cool uni. (...And FINALLY the moment I have long dreamed, the moment I would no longer have some stupid homework to do would become true!) If you didn't know already, I  loathe  homework. I think whoever came up with the concept should die, that is, if he/she isn't dead already. Then there's coursework, which I understand, but I hate doing anyway.     My childhood?   I was born in Argentina, 20 days later went with my family to Brazil, then many years later, to the north of Spain, then a few years later, the South. My native tongue is Spanish, and I used to speak Portuguese (but I no longer do 'cause I forgot it from not using it -- I can merely read it or hear it now).     My interests?   I'm very into computer-related stuff. I've been crazy about them since young, and got my first computer back in 1995; a good ol' Pentium1 at 133Mhz running Win9x. I got internet like a year later. I loved it. I remember my first days of having an internet connection I was overwhelmed by the countless questions I could find an answer for. (Oh yea, forgot to mention, I've always been a very curious person. I like to know how everything works.) Back to what I was saying, I have computer-related interests such as (in no particular order) web design, some graphic design/manipulation, scripting (I love scripting!), some animation, a little programming, knowing how (almost) everything works and some more stuff I don't recall at the moment.  Then there's also my "real world" interests, again in no particular order: sculpture (especially wire and found objects), drawing, poetry, paranormal stuff (preferably the non-scary kind like psychic abilities, and sometimes UFOs), watching films (usually special-effects-intensive (though I don't watch them just for the explosions), sci-fi, CG (go Pixar!) or comedy - and very rarely drama), and I was kind of a writer when young, and would probably still be if I came up with an excellent storyline idea.  I am almost always busy (in the sense that I always have some project of mine that I'd like to get done), and if I have a computer and an internet connection, I am rarely ever bored. One of my main personal projects at the moment is a (web)comic strip I have intention of one day running weekly if not daily. I've been working in random spots of my free time in the last year or so on it. I have numerous sketches, and recently reached the milestone of 200 gags in my list of "gags for strips that I will draw/make someday". It features an ostrich named Ralph. You can see one of my latest sketches on  urlLink my site  in the form of a cheap 'coming soon' page. I know it's near to impossible, but I'd love if one day the comic strip were to become famous and if I could live off it that would be awesome! Ever actually considered what a GREAT job comic-strip cartoonists who live off their strips have? It takes from 10 to 20 minutes at most, everyday, and you can work in advance if you wanna/can. Some who do this which I admire are Jim Davis (Garfield) and Scott Adams (Dilbert). They essentially become rich from a 15 minute daily job. How f*****g awesome is that? And at the same time, so rare and improbable, but hey, I can fantasize, can't I?     What do I usually do when I'm on the computer?   I am either messing with PHP to make useless gadgets (one in my list is a WAP interface to posting on Blogger, but I'll only make it if I start liking this thing called blogging), chatting on IRC, working on my comic strip, working on its website, browsing  urlLink Slashdot  and  urlLink DeviantArt , doing some nifty wire/metal sculptures,  and some other stuff. I'm also always listening (and often singing along) to my dear Winamp5. You can see what I'm currently listening  urlLink here  thanks to a PHP script I recently wrote. Still needs some work though.    And when I'm not on the computer?   I'm most likely taking walks on the beach, or going to capoeira (some Brazilian martial arts) lessons. Or doing sculptures, though I mentioned that earlier.     What are my career desires?   I would love to do special fx for big Hollywood movies, and if that weren't possible, I would like to get into 3D animation (and modeling, I suppose). The downfall to the first choice is that there is like no frikin' uni that teaches it correctly. If I'm successful at some point, you shall hopefully see my name in the credits of some big movie.     How do I feel at the moment?   Well, I wish I had a girlfriend. I'm don't consider myself ugly. (I'm also not anorexic or obese, extremely weak, full of acne, or dress in Star-Trek suits and speaking fluent Klingon, so I don't consider myself "socially repulsive".) I don't drink, smoke, or take drugs though, and some people don't seem to like that, but fuck it. I have rarely found my type of girl, and when I have, I've ended up with a simple negative response. (Yes, I've never had a girlfriend, though I tried.) (First there was a "No", then a "Yes, if only I didn't already have a boyfriend", and another "No".) Hopefully I'll find someone eventually, and soon. There was one time when there was a confusion and I thought I actually had a girlfriend. It lasted a week. I must say that week felt great. Nevermind my broken heart when I found out there had been a confusion. Oh well, life can suck at times, but like that saying says "There's always more fish in the ocean!".  Besides my inexistent lovelife, right now I feel relieved to finally get some sort of holiday sort of thing, though I have very important exams. (One coming up this Tuesday.)     What do I listen to?   I listen to my definition of "good music". I don't usually listen to mainstream music (like pop crap); I'll tell you that much. Check  urlLink my profile  for some of my favourite artists/bands.     Where can you see my artwork?   I am a member of DeviantArt and you may see my  urlLink main page  and  urlLink my photography  (includes photos of my sculptures and stuff). You may also find one of my latest Ralph sketches on its 'coming soon' page on  urlLink my site . -- Eventually there'll be a proper full site with an actual weekly/daily comic strip going on.     Any last words before hitting "Publish Post"?   Jesus, did I really write this much!?  PS: Enjoy my rant! :P
