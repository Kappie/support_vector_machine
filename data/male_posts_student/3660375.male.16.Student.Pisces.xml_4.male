Then it comes back as I step off the bus!! Thank you mother nature!  Also, I was supposed to be going to School to do some History revision lessons.  But thanks to the traffic, I was unable to get to the station on time, and then the on time bus+15mins eventually made it's way and got me to school, so I just managed to catch Mrs. Fahey running round the field -- must have been some sponsored run, and then she did my countersigning for my passport.  But hrmm -- I'm all very awkward feeling.  Had a good day yesterday, Liam let myself and a group of other friends come round to watch the match.  Yeah, he had the usual one thing at least break :oP, and it was a pretty good day all round!  I would go into more detail but you can never be sure who'll read something :oD so better safe than sorry!!  I'm being briefed on MSN about teh "Radium City" I remember being told once about it in History -- how the watches they made were using radium, and the workers would lick their pain brushes and paint the dials with it -- not knowing it was radioactive. It's a strange thing really to find out years later that so many people did die during it, and they were all hidden away, confidentially.  It's also rather sinister, and makes you wonder -- just how many people in our own country "die" or "go missing" every year?  We'll never know, or at least no time soon.  Anywho, I shall take my leave.  I will try to speak later, so for now --  Bye.
