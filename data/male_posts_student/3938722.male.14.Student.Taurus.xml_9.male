Today's topic will be: lyrics! and here are some great ones to inspire you to do something worthwile....like write a book or something....   World Without Melody - Bad Religion:   I don't want to live/ in a world without melody/ sometimes the rhythmic din/ of society is too much for me/ but purpose is prioritized these days,/ the goal is win the prize/ there's a sleeping resonance we hold/ through which we're unified/ so let it out! don't just get lost in the crowd/ no one can deter you from your own path/ there's no trip too remote/ from which you can't come back/ and I've got this hunch about you and me/ none of us are ready/ for a world without melody/ melody is the key/ it's the surest way/ to unlock your individuality/ melody is the key/ it will set you free!/ don't disrelish harmony/ community will make you whole/ work and understanding are the chords/ way deep within your soul/ they only need to be struck once,/ and the vibrations swell and spread/ but if we mute them they decay,/ our sensibilities are dead/ so let it out! don't just be one of the crowd/ hesitance and diffidence will do you in/ and your soul doesn't care/ for social medicine/ and I've got this hunch/ about you and me/ none of us are ready/ for a world without melody...I won't Live without melody...   Well there you have it, there are some great lyrics. kinda long, but nonetheless interesting. i have discovered that the whole World War 2 thing is really overdone...i dont know if anyone has noticed, but there are a LOT of world war two GAMES, for one, and movies, propaganda, etc i mean dont get me wrong, but still its like a good song ruined by playing it too much on the radio! *stops and pants for breath* i mean COME ON!   yeah anyways, amir is comin back from england on the seventh which is gonna b pretty cool, and vanessas commin back I DONT CARE WHEN from pakistan, that is gonna be pretty cool too. and zaras comin back from pakistan i have no idea when but yeah....i GUESS that will be cool too.
