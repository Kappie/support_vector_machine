I was in Barnes and Nobles the other day and just was wandering thinking. For me that's what B is there for, a place for me to wander and think.  strange isn't it? I was just thinking about school grades and my still stagnent (though less so now) social life.  need to try harder and get out of the house more were the conclusions :-P sometimes the most obvious conclusions are the ones you think the least about... music -The luckiest -Ben Folds mood: dunno
