Interestingly enough for you Minnesotans out there, an Iraqi professor from St. Cloud State somehow managed to get his views into the article. Not that there's anything wrong with St. Cloud State (besides having a horribly depressing campus), but you don't exactly see their name mentioned in big news stories very often. Props, I guess.
