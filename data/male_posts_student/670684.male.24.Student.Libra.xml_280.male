I go after the alternative girls.  Not alternative in the Everclear/Good Charlotte sense, but alternative in the  I don't buy what I'm given, and while I might not wear the clothes to put me in a clique, I belong in the clique moreso than most everyone else .  It's attitude...it shows up immediately.  People see confidence.  I got looks today that I didn't get last year or the year before, and it's all because I'm feeling a lot better about who I am today than I was when I first came to Austin.    I like horn-rimmed glasses, hair down to the shoulders, satchels, and smiles.  A thirty year old was in Alternative Poetics...she's a playwright in the Michner program, putting on a stage play in Minnesota this year, so she won't stay in Alt. Poet, but she's taking Foshko's screenwriting section, and we talked a bit about how Bob could quite possibly be the greatest character in the history of education.  She had a little too much of the name-dropping, talking about how great I am persona, but the glasses and satchel were enough for me to ignore the poor sides of the personality and imagine lying in her bed, looking up at the kelly green ceiling, listening to Modeski, Martin,  Wood, and speaking in prosaic vernacular, knowing I'll show up in a stage play somewhere, and she in a screenplay.    And then the girl on the IF bus...everyone on the IF bus was in the most sour of moods...it was like riding in the elevator to purgatory, where we were obligated to stare ahead and not say anything.  She kept looking at my shoes when I'd look at her, and keep her eyes on my shoes until I turned away, at which point she'd look back at me.  I probably should have followed her off the bus, asked her if things were okay, and started a conversation, because she was cool but really sullen.  But I didn't.  Maybe it was the wispy leg hair.  I'd love to be cool with it, but I've yet to be in a position of dealing with it.    Hit  urlLink Mondays in the Sun  yesterday...very good, and a very interesting look into filmmaking outside of the dominant paradigm.  Much like Chekov's  urlLink The Cherry Orchard , this film revolves in nothingness...it defines characters and moves them, but not too radically, because that wouldn't be real.  We want them to win and succeed, but they can't because they can't.  Their victories are small, and we've got to take heed in that.  A good start for my film about the guy who wants to be an artist but isn't any good.
