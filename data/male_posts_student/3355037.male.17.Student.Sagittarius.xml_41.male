When I was first told, it was going to be at either Simon or Derek's place. Then, the second time, I heard it was going to be at Derek's. Next, I hear that only a few 'regulars' are going to make it, but a few others that Derek knows will be making an appearance. Next thing I know, poker decided to move to Happy Joe's then to Hardee's, then back to Happy Joe's. Um... whoever was behind the planning (not pointing any fingers at all...) we need to get this straight next time. You tried, and that's all we ask. Hell, s/he never reads blogs at all, so let's just say this. Dammit, you suck at planning. I (most likely we) appreciate that you were trying to arrange something, but damn. I don't have anything else to say on that subject. Poker topic is done. Now, I have some good news, and no, Geico is not involved.   I went to work today. Yeah, that's not exactly what you thought I'd put immediately following "I have some good news" is it? Sneaky Korean that I am... hahaha. No but seriously though. I do have some good news. A co-worker of mine used to be a DJ before he came to Crookston. He tells me he has some turntables, slipmats, mixer, the works. They are supposedly at his sister's place for now. He is going there in the near future, so I asked him if he could bring them back to Crookston. He never knew I was interested in turntables at all but he agreed. He even gave me an offer. He is willing to lend me whatever equipment I would like for a while, take everything for a test drive (and I don't even have my license! HA! ... sorry)and if I do like them, he is willing to sell whatever I want to me, if it turns out that mixing really isn't for me, then I will be able to give them right back to him. This is a very cool oppurtunity and I can't wait for him to bring them here. I just hope that he is not just giving me a whole crapload of crap just to make it look like he was a DJ or something. I have gotten to know him a bit, and I don't think he would do that. Please be telling me the truth... please...   I WANT SOME TURNTABLES NOW!!!           Hey, look, I have made use of the options though it is a little difficult to make everything stay in its place. Well, hopefully my faithful blogging cult has an enjoyable read here.      Turntables... so close...
