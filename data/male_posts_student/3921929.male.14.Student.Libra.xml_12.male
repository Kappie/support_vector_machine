We got home and started skating my rail and Kevin got bored. Scott and Kevin started making fun of each other and finally Kevin left. Only 10 minutes later, Kevin called back asking if Scott wanted to skate with him, proving that he doesn't have any other friends besides me and Scott. What a loser.
