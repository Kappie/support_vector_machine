New Ulm was a German utopian community founded in the 1800s by a group of German immigrants.  Everything was in German, and the atmosphere of the town was a quaint cross between Europe, 1920's Architecture, and the old west.  The high point was definitely Schell's Brewery, the second oldest family owned brewery in the country.  All in all, a great day!
