I did this last week and I was totally out of it in class.  I talked to Esther on the phone earlier tonight (yay for free long distance and unlimited weekends). It was cool talking to someone that I haven't talked to in a long time.   Oh... I just deleted a long ramble where I try to combine my world systems studies stuff with my personal life / way of thinking. It was lots of BS, that really didn't need to be seen by the world.  ***
