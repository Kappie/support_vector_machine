So when the whole thing is done i will be very very very tired. A whole month of traveling plus when im in central nebraska i will be a t a series of concerts i'll be moshing, jumping, yelling, and if i feel stupid enough to attempt last years amazing stunt i'll go crowd surfing again, but i doubt that will happen. Just on a closing note,  My girlfriend and i broke up a month ago, and i've said and done some things in the last month that when im not still angry i'll be sorry about. So I would like to appologize on my blog not to bring attention to the  situation, but to show everyone who reads this that when you do stupid things out of anger you hurt people, so thats one of the reasons why im appologizing here.
