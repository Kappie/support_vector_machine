I wasn't too excited when I got the Blink 182 cd for X-mas, I haven't listened to them in awhile.  One thing is for sure, they definitly turned to their emo side.  A really interesting about "Feeling this" is that Mark went into a seperate room and wrote the chorus, and Tom went into a seperate room and wrote the verses, they had no idea what eachother was writing about...it turns out they both wrote about sex, and Tom wrote about the physical part, and Mark wrote about the romantic part, so the song is very interesting.  I must say that is a very cool idea, and the outcome was a very good song...quite addicting as well...  One of the things I am pleased they did was the exploitation of Travis's drumming abilities.  There are several drum solos through out the cd.  Travis is god on the drums.  To me he seems like he would be to a drummer what Flea would be to a bassist.  I am displeased with the lack of any just plain funny songs.  There attitude in those songs just make you want to laugh, and there are none of those on this cd.  I am also displeased with Track #7 which was produced by some rap guy, and all it is is a rap beat over and over again...it sickened me...  If anybody dares scream sell out at Blink 182, they should should shoot themselves because they sold out awhile ago, and not in the bad way.  Some people seem to forget that musicians do not stop learning once they are in a band.  Blink 182 shows that they have gained much talent during their long pause since Take Off Your Pants And Jacket.  If you want to use the "Sell-Out" card, lean towards Good Charlotte, who have no music ability and..well...that's a different story...  Overall, Blink 182 has gained a new sound, but not necassarily a bad one.  There lyrics are still addicting as ever, but they lost the funny attitude they once had.   Overall Grade:  B
