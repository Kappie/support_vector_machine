For some reason, even though I got 3 and a half hours of sleep and only had about an hour and a half nap (kinda-sorta passed out around 4:30) I can't go to sleep.  this is a bad pattern, summer's gonna be kinda difficult on the sleeping side I'd guess.  Whatever, I got a feeling this is gonna be good.  I have a car, I know good trails, I have firends, things are looking up.  Stuff's gonna be going down, I can keep busy (go 600 page chomsky book that came today)and the world seems good.  Things being on the up and up is always nice...now if only things were on the up and up on the girl angle.  Sigh, stuff'll happen, whatever, the world'll survive and humanity will come back from the brink of extinction.  Yes, this is a twilight zone episode, and there go my glasses.  Dammit, I'm sounding stream-of-consciousness, I hate that, stream-of-consciousness is bullshit.  I need to have more of a plan to what I have to say with my life.  I need to go back and read this self-indulgent tripe.  I need to stop sounding like a pretentious fuck.  christian was right, i'm haughty, I think I'm better than other people.  Is this true, is this false?  God knows?  Is it bad, is it good...that's my basic philisophical question of my life.  Who's more important, me, or other people.  Rand or Plato.  Am I bitter?  I don't think so...it might just be the indigestion from the chiptole, god knows.  I guess i jsut don't understand myself.  I need introspection.  logical introspection, none fo this bullshit.  I wonder if blogger edits out the cursing, never checked...  Oh, you should check  this  out... http://http://www.dailycamera.com/bdc/letters_to_editor/article/0,1713,BDC_2491_2939058,00.html  I rule!
