Aside from the fact that I'm going to be working for my mom for the next three weeks, I have something to do other than sit on the computer like a loser!  Here's my outline for the rest of the summer:  -Working: So I lied.  I do have to sit at my computer like a loser, but for good reasons.  My mom is going to have me start typing things for her for her transcription business.  I'm gonna get paid just like her normal employees do, which is pretty good pay.  Should make me enough money.  -Tuesday: Unfortunately, my brother is coming home, after a long two week siesta from not having him around.  That's the bad news.  The good news is I get to sit at the airport for 3 hours waiting for him!  Wait...that's not good news.  At all, actually.  But I do get to drive there.  -My driving days: July 12-13 are my driving days for drivers ed.  Yeah, should be boring, but, at least I won't be sitting around my computer like a loser.  -Yearbook Camp: July 19-22 is yearbook camp.  That'll probably end up being the highlight of my summer, but, we'll see how that turns out.    -New York: Yep, I'm heading up north, and for the first time in a long time, we're driving up there.  We're making pit stops at the Paramount Carowinds theme park, which is similar to Universal, but, with more Paramount.  While we're in New York, we're going to drive to Buffalo and go to Six Flags Darien Lake, which is something that I've always wanted to do.  I'll be gone from July 23rd until August 2nd, which will get me home with enough time to get ready for the beginning of my last year in high school.  So, with me working and getting money and stuff, I should have a slightly more interesting summer.  I can't wait to see the Paramount theme park, I heard it was pretty good.  Too bad I'm not going to the Canadian version...they have Tomb Raider: The Ride.  So anyway, now that I know what I'm going to be doing, I'm not bored now.  In fact, I'm also going to Universal next week (I think), but I'm not 100% sure of that yet.
