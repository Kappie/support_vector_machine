The prince vowed to get the princess and she soon fell in love with him, his heart and his mind. They lived immaculate lives and loved each other with respect and whole hearted passion. One day, an evil witch lady popped by the castle and told the prince that he had to leave, or live - with her blood on his hands. Fearing for his first loves' life, he left, that no harm be done to her.  Years passed and the young prince loved her with all of his being still. To her, he had written an innumerable number of letters explaining his departure. The princess either didn't get the letters or didn't get the message. Either way, she hated the young prince. One time, he had  braved the dark woods stealthily, to see how she was doing. He called up to her in her tall tower. That's where she deserved to be- high up above him. She looked out and down at him from her window and killed almost all of his love for her with her words of scorching fire. The distraught prince sought the council of his wisest men, who advised that he move on as his doting was doing him more harm than good. The prince was reluctant and undecided.  Before the sun rose one day, just as the sky was warming to pink, the prince was riding his horse by the countryside. His tears augmented the fresh morning dew as memories of his princess danced in his head. Just then in the middle of the field, he saw a beautiful maiden. She was special, and she too added to the morning dew her tears. He spoke to her and felt her pain. They had a similar disease. Both longed for love lost due to unfortunate action or circumstance. The young prince fell in love with the beautiful maiden.  The young prince was timid, and the beautiful maiden pined with him every passing day, over her lost love. The young prince had not had sufficient courage to proclaim his love to the hurting maiden in fear of tearing her more and being rejected. The young prince became very sad and longed for ample opportunity and courage. He couldn't eat or sleep with ease. Her name was on his mind. The silly young prince.
