Which wasn't a bad weekend, by any means...and the Wednesday after all of that I went with Dan Young and BLThomas to Corpus.  But shit, when will I get a Spring Break again?  No clue.  So I need to do something.  Current plan is to hit Matagorda Bay on Monday and Tuesday, getting some sun and waves in...then either go to Little Rock or Lafayette for the following weekend.  There's a pretty big Centenary wedding in Lafayette on the 20th, and while I wasn't invited, it's one of those things that you're expected to go to even if the invitation isn't extended, and I'd make a big splash as these were good friends who I haven't spoken with in ages.  But the thought of hitting the Rock and chilling with two of my best friends is pretty lucrative as well.  I can't do both.  I've considered buying a digital camera and just driving Texas also...but that's something I should do once my thesis is turned in.  May 7 for that...six weeks.  I'm not fucked.  Yet.    SXSW is here, and I'm big on some of the films.  Paul Stekler's LAST MAN STANDING (not yet on IMDB) is premiering on Sunday...I have a free ticket for later in the month, but this is one worth seeing twice, as it's basically the film I'm writing this semester.  Also, I've got a chance to see the Oliver North campaign documentary A PERFECT CANDIDATE (too lazy to IMDB link) tonight, which I will take, even if it means I've got to sit with Harry Knowles.    A guy is walking past the Little City window with a 24oz Coors Original.  Not yet opened.  Soon to be, I'd assume.    When I directed the scene from ANTIGONE for Buseick's Directing II, I was really big on the idea of the media infiltrating everyday life.  I remember that we read about some director who shot Hamlet like a documentary, and at the end the calvalry comes in to see the total carnage reaped, and how having a camera there made the feel very different from when they just did it on stage.  So I did the death sentence scene for Antigone, with Dawson Taylor playing Kreon, and got Zach Mort and Luke McClung to work as cameramen around the scene.  The cameras weren't on (that would've been ripe awesome, to put their feed through to a big screen), but at the end, after Kreon sentences Antigone, Luke followed the proceedings.  Kreon was left by himself to think about how he had just sentenced his own blood to death, but he wasn't alone, because Zach Mort had the camera right in his face.  The idea of privacy was completely lost, and even though this guy was a true villain, we couldn't feel but sorry for him because he couldn't even think without being captured on film.    This is all non-sequiter on the page.  Who said that blogs must be linear?
