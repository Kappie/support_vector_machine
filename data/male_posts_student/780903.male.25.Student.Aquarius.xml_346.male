It has inspired me to write some song parodies geared more towards performing on stage on general than to law school... but I hope you enjoy anyway...  To the tune of Billy Joel's "Piano Man"  It's halfway through One more endless scene The dialogue's dragging along Yet there's one quick fix in the bag of tricks Let's just all sing a meaningless song  The actor here On the left of me Was clearly not cast for his voice But he wanted a song, though the notes will sound wrong He's the last one left, so we've no choice  Sing us a song, you're the soloist For this number that's just filling space We know that you've come for a musical Here's some music that's in the wrong place  Now the techie backstage had my microphone But she got the clip caught on a light Now I'm screaming as loud as my voice can get But I know you can't hear me tonight  I said techie, I need a replacement mike Ought there be something extra around She said I just do props, and some costuming I don't know what to do about sound  Sing us a song, you're the soloist For this number that's really a waste We know that you've come for a musical And we know this scene should be replaced  Now sometimes a cast isn't big enough But clearly that's not what's wrong here So to give us a chance to let everyone dance There'll be three songs you wished disappear  There are characters we need to parody But when scenes start to build up too long There is only one way that the crowd's gonna stay And that's just if we give them a song  So sing us a song, you're the soloist For this song where the singers won't blend We know that you've come for a musical But I bet you thought soon it would end  Oh, sing us a song, you're the soloist For this number that's killing the band We'll be done in a moment, but humor us With some laughter, and clapping your hand  Sing us a song, you're the soloist One more chorus and then we'll move on To the next random tune we wrote this afternoon But by then all the crowd will be gone...   [to the tune of REM's "Losing My Religion"]   "Leaving my Rehearsal"   Oh, Lord, it's later  It's later than they  Said I'd be here  The times rehearsal goes to  To run this scene once more  Oh no we screwed it up  We start again   That's me in the doorway  That's me out the window  Leaving my rehearsal  Trying to sneak out the door  But I don't know if I can do it  Oh no the dance was wrong  We'll run it six more times  I thought this was till 11  I thought we would start at 8  I think I thought that I'd get fed   Every evening  Every waking hour  I'm leaving for rehearsal  Trying to read in times between  But the band is loud and lights dark  Oh no I missed my line  We start again   Consider this, consider this  The payback for our sins  Consider this  A dream, a nightmare of a dream  Stuck here  What if these notes we get, he'll  Just change his mind  We've been here  Too long  I thought this was till 11  I thought we would start at 8  I think I thought that I'd get fed   And who said run the scene  Once, twice, thrice, why? Who said run the scene, run the scene, run the scene, scene   To the tune of "Smells Like Teen Spirit"  They hung the lights Built the set The microphones Are on the stage   From cue to cue What's the line? This light is wrong Redo design   How long, how long, how long we'll go How long, how long, how long   Listen to the techies screaming Actors on stage, are daydreaming Broken spotlight, won't stop beaming Burning speakers, could be steaming Oh the light tower, please don't climb now Run the last line, one more time now Yeah!  Hey!  Hey!   I broke the leg, off a chair I lost a prop but I don't care Unscrewed a bolt, what the hell I laughed when all the towers fell   How long, how long, how long we'll go How long, how long, how long   Listen to the techies screaming Actors on stage, are daydreaming Broken spotlight, won't stop beaming Burning speakers, could be steaming Oh the light tower, please don't climb now Run the last line, one more time now Yeah!  Hey!  Hey!   And I forget, what's my cue I should have brought some work to do You think they'll care I broke the stage You think we'll ever turn the page?   How long, how long, how long we'll go How long, how long, how long   Listen to the techies screaming Actors on stage, are daydreaming Broken spotlight, won't stop beaming Burning speakers, could be steaming Oh the light tower, please don't climb now Run the last line, one more time now It's a spotlight Broken spotlight Shining spotlight Falling spotlight One less spotlight...
