As the article suggests, we are subjected to a constant anecdotal barrage of how Iraq is turning into a -- say it with me - 'quagmire' from whence we shall not escape.  There are many positive aspects of our relationship with the average Iraqi, and far more good is going on there than bad.  It is interesting to note that the Shiites, whom make up a majority in Iran, seem to be more favorable to the US.  I think this portends some bad times for the Tehran Mullahs in the future.
