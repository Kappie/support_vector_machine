But something strange is happening. I am beginning to realise something more. More about me. A guitar isn't just a fret-board with the capability of producing sounds. It is a way of communicating a wide variety of emotions to a listener without the need for words. The same can be said for all musical instruments, although some can represent more emotions than others might. A song can give the listener an idea, make them think from another viewpoint, reflect an emotion the listener might've had, it could be almost anything. We shouldn't take any kind of music for granted. I dosn't matter about what their image is. It is the relationship between the listener and the song which is important. Some people don't understand, or choose to ignore this fact when choosing who to like and who to dislike. I like the 'Red Hots' because they reflect a part of me. I can't explain it with words what makes them so special to me. I'm almost certain that Sam feels the same way about them... I really hope I can  get the band together and do the performance. Not so we can look cool and be popular (that's just an added bonus), but so I can share a peice of me with everyone else and help people realise who I am.
