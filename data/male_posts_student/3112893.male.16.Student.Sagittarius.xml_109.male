Take Noodles, from The Offspring, he must have lost his legs (maybe back when he was a janitor) and had them replaced with pogo sticks or something; because he just hops up and down throughout the song (or at least in all the videos I saw).  Do you want to know what I think? I think all bands play a reasonable chord when recording, but when it's time for the live show, they tune their guitars to something ridiculous like A G B D F Y and change the fingering around so that tabbers can't figure out what they're playing.  Modest Mouse, when playing  Bury Me with It  live, what one sees him play totally contradicts what one hears him play. Well at least there was a guy in the audience with a mohawk.
