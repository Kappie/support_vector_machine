Remove from freezer at least 1/2 hour before preparation.  2 roma tomatoes, diced 2 cloves of garlic, chopped Handful of fresh basil, chopped Salt  pepper to taste   Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in hot skillet.  Add garlic.  Add tortellini (say 10-15 pieces) and saute quickly.  Add 2 tbsp of butter to brown.  Add tomatoes  basil.  Cook for 2-4 minutes or until tortellini is browned (even crispy!).  Remove prompty, place in pasta bowls, add salt  pepper to taste.  Right before serving, add freshly grated Pecorino Romano.  Too easy.  Serve with an ice cold Pinot Grigio.
