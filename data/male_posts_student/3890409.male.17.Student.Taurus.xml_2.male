I like things to be uncluttered, so I believe, just by only registering, that this is the right place for me.  In this blog I may ramble, I may argue, or I may not say anything at all. It depends on my mood at time of post. I will not disclose any extremely personal information on this site purely for safety/security reasons.  Now, onto the real reason why I'm here.  Today didn't start off well at all. My sister little friend decided to call the house at 8:30 this morning, while, in the process, waking me up. :( I need sleep! Of course, it didn't help at all that I was up untill around 4:30 last night. Anyways, the point is, I'm not in a particularly good mood at the moment. Hopefully I'll get better soon.  Anyways, there's not much more I can write about at the present time. So this concludes my first entry.  Later
