(It was too small so he threw it back) Dave caught a skate. Joe caught a flounder. Min caught a skate and  a seagull . When I snagged my skate, he came over with the net to scoop it up. While he was down by the water pulling on the line, Ben yelled, "Hey, Min! Your pole!" And lo and behold, there was a seagull eating the bait off his hook.  This was my last day with Min, at least till Thanksgiving break. I knew people were leaving for college, but it never seemed that real to me till I realized Min was leaving Friday. People have already left. Min's leaving. Hell,  I'm  leaving. This is just like graduation. You wait and wait for it, and it just seems further and further away. But when it finally arrives, it doesn't feel real. You think you'll just be back in high school after the summer, back practicing three times a day in the summer for football, seeing the same people day after day. But in fact, it really is over. And when move-in day seemed like some far off date, it's quickly approaching. Man...
