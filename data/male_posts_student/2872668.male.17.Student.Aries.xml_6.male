Joy...i needed to ask her how to get to east coast park for tomorrow's CO barbecue thingy. Peifen...well, she was in my section and i needed to contact her to check some stuff.  But things didnt really go accordingly as planned. My first mistake was assuming that my call to joy would take 5 min. Unfortunately...she continued talking and talking, abt her schoolwork, science fair, busking activity, -PE-!, her sisters' dieting, gay marriages...and a whole fabulous load of others. Great. In the end, we spoke for hours again till nine, such that I had not gotten down to doing homework, while she had missed her dinnertime. In fact i was rather irked by this and thus i asked if she spoke to others for so long. She told me she only talked to her other close fren audrey (whom i know), and even so not as long. She said we didnt talk abt important things like her ideals anyway (i didnt get what she was saying but i think she meant i wasnt close at all to her). I was saying stuff like i simply intended to inquire the way to ecp, that was all...she said it was polite to catch up with me. Oh well.  In the end, I told her i'd call her around once a week. Just so she could have someone to talk to? and its quite relaxing to lie my head on the mahogany desk, slowly dozing off as she speaks of another world of experiences. I do learn and gain from socialisation.   'Learning is the only thing that never fails. That is the only thing which the poor mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting.' - Merlyn, The Sword in The Stone.
