The most stupid thing bout today is that i spent one hour to go to skool, one hour to return from skool, and skool only lasted for one and a half hour!! Bleah, knew i should have  just skipped skool today.         10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT SJI:   1.Having to listen to the principle's long and boring speech every monday   2.Having to spend an hour to go and return from skool   3.Having to eat within 30 miserable recess minutes (includin queueing and cleanin time)   4.Having to clean canteen tables after recess   5.Having to pay $150 a month....   6.The fact that we cannot use most of the facilities in the skool. (eg. field, gym, weights room, tennis court, etc)   7.The fact that soccer is not a CCA   8.The fact that students cannot gel their hair. (possibly the only skool with this rule)   9.The fact that the teachers get all the toilet papers in the staff toilet while the students have to scavenge for toilet papers.   10.The fact that Kefli is my Geog/SS teacher.       Hecks, today's ANNUAL PARADE. Not marchin, my uniform has been decomposin in the AIR ROOM for bout 3months already. When i took it home yesterday, it was rotten, filled with moulds and possibly some mushrooms. BLEAH. My CSM wanna make me do 150 pushups for my lack of commitment in the NCC. Well i gotta tell him this, FUCK U. He aint gonna touch me coz if he does, im kickin his ass.
