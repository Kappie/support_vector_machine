Actually, during the SYF flashcard, I already watched the mass performance by Boon Lay SEc and Deyi Sec... They performed again during NDP...This year's NDP is probably one of the most memorable ones I've had. Ok, I know I'm not really writing in standard English here, so pardon my English...Hahaz...
