The movie effectively uses bright pop images in contrast with the dark backgrounds the story is set in. Although I'm not too convinced that Chuck Barris really worked for the CIA, it is, nonetheless, an interesting story. Pretty much everything in the movie was good, but I just wish they wouldn't show Sam Rockwell naked so much.   urlLink  Runaway Jury    I'm not too sure about this one. It does seem to be heavily influenced by political views on gun control. Nate seemed to be agitated by it more than I was. It does bring up a few good points about the court system, however, but I really didn't find it to be that great of a movie otherwise.   urlLink  Starsky  Hutch    This one has some great laughs and I really like the Stiller/Wilson duo as Starsky and Hutch. Anyone that likes their kind of humor should see it. "Do it, do it."    I'm waiting to see:    urlLink  The Passion of the Christ     urlLink  Hidalgo      urlLink  Monster      urlLink  The Last Samurai      urlLink  The Fog of War      urlLink  Peter Pan      urlLink  Cold Mountain     Coming to DVD:    urlLink  Kill Bill Vol. 1    April 13    The Return of the King   May 25th [  urlLink DVDFILE: press release  ]
