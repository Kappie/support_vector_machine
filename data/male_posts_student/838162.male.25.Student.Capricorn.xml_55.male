Trying to do something about that, but so far no go.... it's a pity...I consider the archives to be an important part of a blog. Not only for others to catch up with whats going on, but also for oneself, to go back to read what I once wrote and reflect on how far (or how low) I have gone since then.  In the meantime enjoy the faster loading, and I hope to have some pics/graphics up soon because...well frankly...because I can *grins*
