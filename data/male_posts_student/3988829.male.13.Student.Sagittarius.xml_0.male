I went straight to the last few pages where the Letters to the Editor were published. I was nervous. I scanned through all the letters until I found... MY NAME! Yes! My e-mail had been published! I blinked, rubbed my eyes and pinched myself. Was this really happening? Did the editors of Britain'sbest footballmagazine really think my email was good enough to be published along with a few other outstanding letters and emails? Without a second thought I went straight to the counter and bought it. Let me explain it a bit, just in case you're a bit confused. A few months ago (June, actually), I sent an email to  Shoot Monthly  because every month, they chose a 'star letter' (the most outstanding, creative or emphatic letter sent that month) and the writer of that letter received a cool football. So when I sent the email my real intention was to win the ball, but who cares as long as it's published? This was surreal. It felt like lifting the World Cup. Well, not really, but it was still pretty cool. To read my letter, get the August 2004 issue of  Shoot Monthly.  My letter is on thesecond to last page, and the subject is 'CLAUDIO WAS GOOD'.
