I wish i could catch a plane and go meet her .. i cant seem to concentrate on anything else . keep blaming god .. but does he really exist? If he does does he really care ?    Artist: Blink-182  Song: I Miss You   Don't waste your time on me you're already The voice inside my head (I miss you miss you) I miss you (miss you miss you)   I got locked out of my room today , had to cycle twice in the rain to the accommodation office to go get the right set of keys.I go have a shower and when i get back up the door's locked.. blasted luck ... i guess i was lucky cos i still had a set of tracks and a T,i could atleast go out and i didnt have to ask Lisa.    Lisa is still being  a bitch .   Think a lot about C, wish she's ok .I wish that she calls / leaves offliners more often , i guess she wont understand the way i feel about her, even if she did, she'd have to love me ... keep having this thought of free well in my head from  Bruce Almighty  why must i be the one to miss her ? why me ?    Artist: Sugarcult Song: Memory    This may never start  We could fall apart  And I'd be your memory  Lost your sense of fear  Feelings insincere  Can I be your memory   So get back, back, back to where we lasted  Just like I imagine  I could never feel this way  So get back, back, back to the disaster  My heart's beating faster  Holding on to feel the same      Artist: Simple Plan Song: I'd Do Anything  Another day is goin by im thinkin about you All the time but your out there and im here waiting And wrote this letter in my head cuz so many things were left unsaid but now your gone and i cant think straight  This could be the one last chance To make you understand  I'd do anything just to hold you in my arms to try to make you laugh somehow i cant put you in the past i'd do anything just to fall asleep with you will you remember me? cuz i know i wont forget you
