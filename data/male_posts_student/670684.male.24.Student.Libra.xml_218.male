There, I played an eclectic taste of 80s synthesized rock for two hours on Tuesday, finding rhythms, climaxes, tempos, and trying to create a retro trance for the duration.  I worked my ass off for my audience, realizing that my audience was inconceivably small, if at all existant.  Rarely do I believe more than 10 people were listening at one time, due to the lack of KSCL publicity, lack of KSCL range, and lack of KSCL quailty for most shows (you could hear Christina Aguilera twice a day, and Pain's  Fight  five times a day, usually during a show from a Kappa Sigma).    When my second round of energy on this beast occured about six weeks ago, I stopped looking at the site statistics.  Before, I would weekly check the site to see when my hits were, and how many hits there were on what days...if I hit the site more than once, it would distort the numbers, so I had to post, look, and be done.  Usually there were seven or eight hits, not too bad a ratio, but really solidifying the masturbatory nature of such a weblog.  At the renaissance, I started writing rather than just commenting...I wanted people to read, but fuck 'em if they weren't.  If I were to depend on my statistics for morale, the first day of low hits would be the last day of the blog.   But few feelings are better than the old, "Hey, I stumbled across your page..." emails that come after a site is up, stays up, gets bandied in a circle of folks as an off-color comment, and then someone working in a cubicle gets bored and decides to check out that site they remember but don't know why, and here it is, nothing but text, but not bad text...not too good of text, but better than a lot that is out there, worth reading because it's this or solitare and you've got six hours left in your day and the work is done and if you're not grabbing ass you're going to start sticking objects up it.    Three such emails in the past two days.  I was skipping on my way to the cafeteria this morning (I eat in a cafeteria.  I live in a dorm room.  I will live in a dorm room for the next six weeks.  It doesn't feel odd.  It strangely feels right.  Too right.  I like this too much.  I feel too comfortable.  More comfortable than I felt in any apartment or house I've lived in since I graduated Centenary, except the Brian Thomas apartment, which was more rooming with Brian than the shitty apartment with high rent and pidgeon-infested storage units).    Yet it gets better.  Two emails were from old friends.  Really old friends.  Friends I haven't spoken to in six years.  Somehow, they found the blog.  And somehow, each found a section from February where I listed all of the people I lost contact with that I really wanted to have contact with again.  Both were on it...well, one was on it, while the other was a member of a 10-12 person group (but an important group, Heath...an important group!).  The emails were brief...it's been six years, what do you talk about?  But they arrived in the inbox, with a name I recognized from long ago that I didn't expect to hear from, and it caused me to smile, and to click the name with enthusiasm, and sit fixated on the message, and ponder it and them once through.    And now, the problem.  I spent a lot of time with these folks at one point in my life...it's why I miss them, and why I want to get back in touch.  So, how do I do it?  I've lost touch with people before, and started it up, and it goes fine for two or three emails, and then you're out of things to say because you've remembered the past, caught up on the present, and realized the future doesn't readily include this person from the past...you might want it to, but only in a way completely convenient to your current situation, because you've done just fine without this person in your life for however many days, so what's a few more, or all of them?  The emails stop, you sit with a message from them in your inbox for months, finally delete it, and two years later put their name on a weblog hoping to get in touch with them again.    And I don't want that to happen, because what is the point then?  I do miss these people.  I think about them ever so often, more than just in passing sometimes.  It would be great to see them again, catch up and then continue forward.  But how when we're most likely subjected to email?    This doesn't mean you shouldn't write me if you're an old friend.
