I am actually a part time student but I sell TN products in my spare time and helping out my dad who is a Takaful Nasional agent too. To date Takaful Nasional's assets number at 2.8 billion ringgit, making us the strongest Takaful company amongst all the current takaful companies which include  urlLink Takaful Malaysia ,  urlLink Takaful Ikhlas  and Takaful Maybank.  I hope that this explanation suffices for now.  Anyway the reason I started this blog is to explain the Takaful concept with the public and perhaps let in some important info in the industry. I will also be airing some incidents I have had with customers in the past and express my views on them. Insha'allah I hope you will find my blog useful :)
