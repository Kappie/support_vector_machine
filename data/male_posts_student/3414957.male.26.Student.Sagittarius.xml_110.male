Overall, it was funny because most of us were cracking jokes about how gay the movie was. I had a great time.    I have to remember to go to work early tomorrow. This nice guy I know there has an interview online at 9:00am sharp but the room opens at 9 so I told him I would get there early so he can login in time to setup for htis interview. I am too nice I know after I even said that I wasn't going to help anyone anymore! Damn, my achilles heal, kindness. Its that urge I have to help people. Sometimes it hurts me to help others. I get taken advantage of so I must be carefull. This guy seems pretty stand up.   Say no to Happy Texas!!!
