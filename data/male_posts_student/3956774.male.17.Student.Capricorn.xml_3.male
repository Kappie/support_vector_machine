So my children, when will you statrt pouring in and purchesing your peripherals????? Then one did arrive home, whereupon I ate a chinese. She was very nice, if not a bit stringy.......Aftet this brief enocunter with another culture I enbarked on a worldwind advetnure with my good pal Bruce, or Lesley as she likes to be known in certain circles... We went to drive, foiund some hidden treasure, got hissed at by an old women with a bag, then solved world peace and the aids pandemic...after that we went to mcdonals and got hot apples pies, which we tried to give one to Lee only he didnt asnwer his door...rudeth scallywag. Upon hearing this sad news I began to eat the afformentioned hot apple pie and it was good. I then came home. I fully suppoort the work of the Fontwell for Capital commitee and feel that a change of scenery from London to Fontwell could be very well what this country needs... Altho such drastic moves are not leagally binding in 48 states. Anywho my brethren i shall leave thee be for i must move on and proceed to sleep.... tatty bye spudlings
