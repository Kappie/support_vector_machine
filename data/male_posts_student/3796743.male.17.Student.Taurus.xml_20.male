Then I went to the mall with my mom and grandparents and bought hair product. Which was by the way the highlight of my day. And that is no good. Well I had a grilled sub at Charley's. I love that place. So then I came home and talked to people online for ever, but it was cool. And then I went out because I was depressed and got some gas in my car cause it was passed the little red mark. Passed the little red mark = NOT GOOD!But then I felt sorry for myself so I ran over to Starbucks and got my Iced Grande Carmel Macchiato and several butterhorns! I love those things, it made my day all better. :) Now I'm online scheduling a hotel for when I go to Canada in two days and an airplane ticket for when I go to San Francisco with Emmy. I can't wait for that trip, it'll be fun. Plus its like the only trip I get to go on this summer. My sister is in frickin Europe and I get to stay home all summer. Yay me! Anyways, I continue to do nothing...and that is not cool. I need social interaction and I have nothing. I feel all lonely and stuff. :( . My parents and grandparents are out gambling again, so I'm all alone. Well, I best be off to do something else...Don't know what yet. I'm off!  So this person's profile is filled with these good like lyrics or whatever. I got todays and yesterdays from this person's profile. Go you! You know who you are! Heres some good lyrics. See y'all tomorrow.  Woke up this morning, jumped out of bed,  Hit my head on a lampshade and the clock said  That I'm running late so I'm rushing  trying to get on my way  Get to my car and the gauge is on E,  Get gas and i pay 2 dollars ninety-three  Got stopped by the cops cause I was speeding  Eighty-nine in a fifty-five Lord, why me  On a day like today,  All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy  Gotta hold on, smile on my face  Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  On a day like today,  Look up at the sky and know life's so amazing  And I know I will be okay  Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way :-D  Later All.
