He watched Monty Python's Life of Brian in the flat and then tuned on the toob to watch some football as Croatia pounded Denmark.  Other than that he didn't do anything.  This morning he slept in pretty late as his brother went up to Arthur's Seat (the mountain) and his dad did some bus tours.  His mom went up to Sterling Castle which is an hour's train ride away but is the site of some great history.  It is where William Wallace fought (Braveheart) and Tyke's mom and brother are all related to Wallace as Tyke's mom found out in her genealogy research.  So there was quite a bit that she wanted to see up there but Tyke didn't want to spend most of the day only doing that.  Instead Tyke stayed home and did his own thing.  He watched some parts of some movies before heading out for a bite to eat.  He saw his brother on his way back and they both grabbed some sandwiches.  Then Tyke's dad came back and Tyke left again.  He went to a mall like area where he looked at some clothes and got an Italian sweatshirt and a Scotland shirt as well.  There is this one store that is just so cheap.  They have most everything marked down to really cheap apparently for some summer sale.  Tyke looked at that pair of shoes he saw earlier again and tried them on only to find that they weren't super comfortable so he decided to not get them, even if they were quite cheap.  He continued to walk around and then finally just came back home.  Then his dad started watching a movie and there wasn't any food so Tyke decided to go back out and came to the cafe and is going to grab a bite to eat in a second.  Now Tyke is finding out that he has nothing more to say really.  He has written a few postcards today and planned on sending them out but found out he doesn't have the addresses with him as Tyke's mom does.  So he has to wait to do that.  But Tyke doesn't know if he will be able to blog in a while so he had to do it once more.  Time keeps on ticking.  Only one more week left.  Let's see...it's 8AM right now back in Washington.  That's pretty early.  Bye now.
