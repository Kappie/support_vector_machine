He started thinking about how he might hang out with Tina on Wednesday night but then he realized that he is just kidding himself and that neither tomorrow, Thursday, nor the rest of the week are the two going to hang out other than in class and at the football game on Friday.  Well, that ain't all bad.  No, it sucks.  Oh well, Tyke is far from content with his situation with her but it is better than nothing.  Tina had detention again today and her and Tyke walked and talked again.  This time though Tina came to Tyke instead of Tyke coming to Tina.  Sigh.  Sigh.  Why does she have to have a boyfriend?  They don't even go out to lunch much or talk much it seems.  To Tyke, it seems like he and Tina are closer to each other than Tina and Kram.  Damn, Tyke thinks too much of his situation.  He isn't really that close to being with Tina.  Tina probably doesn't even think about how Tyke feels or even think about him outside of when they are together.  Thats it...Tyke is getting over Tina starting now.  There is no point for him to keep pursuing her since he has done an absolutely horrible job these past 4 years.
