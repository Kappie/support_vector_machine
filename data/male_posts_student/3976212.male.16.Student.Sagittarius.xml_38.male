Almost every night I wake up screaming because of a horrible leg cramp in my Gastrocnemious muscle (hehe I took that word from a medical website-it means Calve) thats lower back of leg. I just go into a spasm for 1 to 3 minutes and it is insanly painful. Always my left leg. A couple times (not while sleeping-but while bending strangly) I have recieved insanly painful (and in my opinion extremely scary) thigh spasms. These are insanly painful and scary things---and its a scary horse tranqualizer like pain that nobody wants to experiance-Ever. But it happens, and usally it happens late at night (6, 7am) and I don't know what to do. It really scares me because I am trying to remember how to cure it and I remember back to my Grandmother said about releaving foot spasms (cause I go for long, long walks) which is to press my toes on the ground. So in my middle-of-the-night thinking I find it reasonable to just arch my foot's arch! (well I was floating last night if you read my last post). But thats my little rant about my leg cramps...and it's the main reason why I havn't gone to bed yet. I am actually scared to sleep. Last night was an especially horrific experiance because of my druggening. Oh, that reminds me...I told my mom some crazy ass story about why I was drugged...but I havn't told my dad about it yet--cause I don't want him thinking anything else. All I know is I started feeling weird right after I got home. It scared me a lot.
