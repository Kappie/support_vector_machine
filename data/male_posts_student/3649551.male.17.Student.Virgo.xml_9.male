It's been criticized for being very unrealistic (as in highly coincidental at times) and overly dramatic, but then again ... it's melodrama. That's the idea. Personally, I think it's a good old-fashioned story. I love every page because there's never a dull moment. It's one of those aged and enchanting books that just captures you. There's just something about it that makes it very fun to read. I had a similar experience with Bram Stoker's  Dracula , which a certain Becca the Beauty Queen has finally started reading. I swear, people should trust me when I recommend a book. They seem to think I'm joking when I talk about how good it is. Hey, now I've finally landed on a subject I can talk about for a while. People with sarcastic senses of humor get a bad rap. Just because I say things that are bitter and cynical doesn't mean thatI  am  bitter and cynical. It just means that I find such things humorous. There's a difference. See, people always talk about how bitter and world-weary I am. I don't feel that way at all. I've been alive just under eighteen years for God's sake, I have no right to be world-weary. As for bitter: I'm certainly bitter oncertain subjects (like my father or maybe women), but besides that what do I have to be bitter about? Nothing at all. Life is good. You hear me, ye of little faith?! I'm happy with my life so far. I just come off as negative because I'm always looking to grow and expand and learn. I think if we're not always striving to be a better person, we're not living. We're existing. Life is not meant to be static: that's why God subjected us to existing in Time. Oh by the way, Josh the Philosopher started a blog. I hope you're not offended by lambsticks.   urlLink http://lambsticks.blogspot.com/
