In fact, if you listen to the various TV and news tpyes around, they are the only team playing.  What amazes me is that they seem to think that we are the best team out there when, and I wish it wasn;t the case, we clearly aren't. The first match of the competition was against France. They are the former World and European champions, and rightly so, as they have about half a dozen of the best players in the world in their side. Leading up to the game the tone was one of cautious optimism that, on the right day, way may be able to get something out of the game. Until game day. Then, certain pundits felt that the  'awesome arrogance'  of the French side would let us plucky Engalnders to sneak in and take the game from them. After all, they were confident in their ability (well so would you let's face it). But surely they would be more carful about such an important game, and considering that in the last World Cup, they went out in three games without scoring a goal.  So, the match starts and both teams play well, and amazingly England lead 1-0 going into half time. Well, as you can expect this leads to a bit of premature celebraing and the predictions of the final score get a bit stupid, as if they realise that they are losing against a country that is obviously more important than they are so the should feel grateful that we'll let tham getaway without being flogged as well. Still, in the dying seconds, literally, it's about injury time, up pop the French score 2 goals, stuck 2 fingers up at us and go home. Shock. But what is to com is better.  Every news report and every game in the other groups (there are 4 groups with each group playing in order) discusses and disects the goings on that led to the goals. They carry press conferences with anybody who may have any connection to the team (even if it is just one of the trainers) and 'experts' discuss what they should have done differently. Of course, over the nmext few matches similar situations are enacted with different teams. Every time, the commentators notice this and remind you, if you've managed to forget, of what happened on the time that actually mattered.  Now, England have to play Switzerland and, yes, they do have to win to have a chance to go through. But wait a minute, they are not the greatest team there has ever been and I don;t think it has occurred to the team that they could lose. Since they won't. But now all the pundits are going on about how it's time to face up and all the team are worried now there is nowhere to hide. Rubbish.  The team know how good they are. It's only the media's opinions that change  Jack
