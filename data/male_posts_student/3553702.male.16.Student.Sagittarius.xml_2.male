Today, readers, I'm going to talk about something as simple as music: and how stupid people can be about it.  I understand that everyone had their own tastes, but why does that mean that people are allowed to trash other's tastes?! I'll admit, even I do it sometimes, but it seems like some people make entire rules for their lives out of musical tastes or something! For instance: the "punk movement". All of these teens (and I guess adults...) who ONLY listen to punk and anyone who doesn't is a "prep" or just a loser, and anyone who listens to punk but doesn't look/act/be punk at ALL times is a "poser". Doesn't that defeat the point of being "punk"? Last time I checked, being punk was about not listening to other people's rules, and about questioning authority...and yet they make rules about how to be punk. I think the stupidity speaks for itself.  Of course, its the same with most other music types, this one just kind of stuck out to me recently (I spent half the day listening to my MxPx CD) but the same applies to most of the stuff I listen to. For instance: Christian metal. This little listening choice has gotten me more grief than anything. For a couple of reasons:  1. Christians who are anti-"Christian music". These people seem to think that it can't be true God worshipping music unless there's a fricking organ and a choir of old folks belting it out. They say that the lyrics are sacriligious and the instruments aren't "proper" for worship, even though hundreds of years ago, the EXACT SAME THING was said of worship music with those organs and choirs that the old people prop up now. Again, I think the stupidity speaks for itself. And it probably will for most of this stuff.  2. Christians who are against Christian Metal only...these people infuritate me. I don't understand them at all. They go off and listen to their Relient K, or their Dogwood (Both bands that I am fricking addicted to, especially Dogwood), completely blowing off anyone else's likes just because there's some sort of lame stigma on metal in general and Christian metal specifically.  3. "Secular" metal listeners who don't believe that Christian metal can be as good or hardcore because its Christian. As if their faith somehow keeps them from playing the guitar or the drums as well as a secular musician...the stupidity, oh, you know the drill!  4. People who ignore the lyrics or influence of the Christian metal band and assume that they MUST be evil/Satan influenced because they're metal. These are the people that wear me out the most. I simply don't understand how they can concentrate so much on something as dumb as what OTHER bands in the same genre have to say! I don't go around screaming about how all country songs are about either drinking, objectifying women, or a combination of both....even though this would be a MUCH easier argument to make.  Finally, I just want to say that I'm NOT trying to say that metal is the best music, or that country music sucks or anything like that. My opinions are just that: mine. And your's (the reader) is just that: yours. So, please, lets try and keep them to ourselves or at least be civil about it when we're discussing them. It makes things easier for those of us who don't feel like having a debate over something so simple.
