A lady, who seemed to be in her 30's was standing infront of me, it appeared she was waiting for someone too. Generally I'm not a very outgoing kinda guy, it made me think about what would happen if I did say "Hello".  So the conversation began in my head "Hello" "Hi" "You waiting for someone too?" "Do I know you?" "Well, no, but I figure that we don't really have that long on this earth in the scheme of things so I've decided to talk to everyone, that way I wont miss out on all the great people I never met. I mean yeah, there are gonna be the nasty ones, but that's the case everywhere in life, you just have to deal with 'em and get on with life."  I got about this far when my dad came in the car :p I'll post up some pictures of the Theatre royal when I get home tonight, it's truly an amazing place.
