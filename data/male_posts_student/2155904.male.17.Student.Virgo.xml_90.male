He kinda snapped out of it in 4th period while listening to some music.  Then he went out to lunch with Dr. Phil and Amed and ditched Macaroon and Kinker pretty much.  It was ok though cuz they went out together.  But Tyke went to Costco and got such a good ice cream bar.  Those things are so damn good.  Tyke could eat one.  And then another.  Mmmm...ice cream.  After that Tyke came back to lunch to take the data match thingy but he didn't have time so he failed at doing that.  Then he went to Graphics and helped Macaroon make his new logo for the school.  It turned out pretty sick.  Like good enough to be put on uniforms and shit.  Tyke really does like it.  After that they had a pretty easy Physics quiz and such.  Good times began after that.  Tyke and Macaroon took on Kinker and Purdy (in that order) in bball at the comm cent.  It was an historic battle between the two colossal giants, Tyke and Kinker, and the two speedy shooters, Purdy and Macaroon.  Coming into the contest, Tyke was picking Kinker to win.  However, Tyke was playing quite well in the game.  He blocked Kinker once and kinda blocked another but was playing very good disruptive D to start it out.  Kinker got a little frustrated but that didn't stop the FORCE from scoring.  Tyke did what he could and managed to play pretty stringent defense while working pretty well on the offensive side too.  He couldn't hit one of his two 2's though when he really needed to so they ended up losing 11-8.  But it was a close battle.  Tyke had 6 and Macaroon 2.  Macaroon's shots just weren't falling and Tyke had no trouble with that.  But he did get schooled by Purdy once and she kinda dominated him a couple times.  All in all, Macaroon coulda stepped it up more.  Purdy played pretty well for totally being out of her element.  Playing on the carpet, with the brace, and with a men's ball.  She was a troubador...no...trooper out there and showcased her talent with an amazing lay-in that somehow went in.  Tyke was getting ready to swat it out of the court but she threw it up so awkwardly he had no chance.  And it somehow went in.  So all in all, Tyke was MVP of his team and Kinker of his.  But it was a great battle and hopefully there will be more in the future.  But maybe Tyke will be able to dunk by then.  He really thinks he will be able to dunk sometime in his life on a full size hoop with no added help.  If he grows 2 more inches and doesn't lose his vertical jump then he will definitely be able to dunk.  If he gets another 2 inches on his vert he thinks he can dunk.  All this could be wrong but he was kinda close today.  The rim rejected the ball.  But that is still pretty good for a 5'11" 130 pound white guy.  Although weight has nothing to do with it as it is easier to be lighter.  Purdy ended up going home to eradicate some problems but the guys stuck around.  They played 21, bounce 21, HORSE, and just a bunch of fun games.  It was really fun and Tyke was feeling good.  After that Tyke came home and ate a sub sandwich and drank some A Cream Soda.  Then he sat on his couch in his boxers and shorts for a long time as it was really comfortable.  And he was tired.  Then he showered and ate pizza and Macaroon and Amed came over.  They watched some games and stuff and then went to the girls bball game.  Tyke drove the A-VA-LON and whoo that was great.  At the game Tyke sat next to Frederique.  Tyke had made a double-sided sign.  One side for Tina, and one for Haras.  Haras was pleased by the sign even though it was not much.  But it's the thought that counts and Tyke literally spent 15 minutes trying to think of a subject for his sign.  But she smiled when she saw it and that is all Tyke needed.  Tina saw her sign too but Frederique was holding it for most of the time.  The game was fun.  More good times.  Afterwards the crew, Tyke, Kinker, Macaroon, and Amed all went over to Farget.  Tyke blew past Racer on the freeway.  She was going about 60 in the Subaru while Tyke easily cruised past 90 (and it was cruising not speeding as you don't feel a thing in the A-VA-LON).  The cool guys got some cool drinks and then they used the Self-Scan machine which is always a treat.  Especially when you only have one item.  Then they went back to Tyke's house and he owned the street.  He managed to forget to turn on his lights he thinks but he still past Kinker and Amed in one fell swoop and just dashed by them.  Amed's reaction to that was great.  Tyke doesn't remember what it was but it was great.  The guys got home and played some Halo.  Then DOTTI CAME OVER!!!!  And she knew how to get to his house too!!!!  Now that is wicked cool!!!  A great addition to the crew on this night.  They all played a few rounds of Chinko when she got there and she caught on quick.  This game is gonna catch soon.   The whole school is gonna be hooked before the year is over.  Just wait...JUST WAIT!!!  Dotti seemed to enjoy it, if only minorly.  Then the video time came.  Since Dotti hadn't seen any videos, Tyke showed em all.  The Amazed one got the usual response.  Freaked.  She couldn't seem to believe that Tyke showed the video to Tina.  Yeah, it's a little...hmmm, odd.  But still a well-done video.  All of the videos were semi-good so they decided to make another edition of Talking Sex with Dema "The Russian" Shevelenko.  This one revisited the PACO shirt so it was good.  They had some pretty good calls Tyke thinks so it should be alright.  It was about 20 minutes long probably.  Good times.  Dotti left in the middle of the video so they said their teary-eyed goodbyes but then quickly resumed videotaping upon her departure.  They finished it out and it is done.  Then they played some more Halo.  Then they all retired to their homes.  Good times.  And then Tyke blogged.  Tomorrow Tyke gets a "nice ass" and will probably hang out doing the use.  Not that much homework this weekend so that's good.  More time for the ladies...oh wait, more time for the guyssss...Damn.
