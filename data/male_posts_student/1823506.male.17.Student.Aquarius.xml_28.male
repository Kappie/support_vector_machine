 Monday was a good day indeed. Zoe and Claire arrived here around 1:00. After Fillmore we went out to pick blackberries on Bear Hill. Its still a little early in the season, but once we got high enough up the hill we found plenty of berries. We also found Zoe's grandmother. Her family used to own a lot of the property around here, there are still several members living up the hill. Her grandma had the same idea as we did, and took Zoe's cousin out picking. There were plenty of berries for all, and it was neat to run into people we (read: Zoe) knew. 
 We came back with too many blackberries to eat in a day. Once Jack arrived we made spaghetti, then when Bob got here we blended up some blackberry milkshakes. Yum yum yum. We went upstairs to watch Casablanca, followed by Strange Brew. We made Bavarian cream with current and blackberry sauce, watched some of the Democratic National Convention, and generally goofed off. I was a little sick from all the food, Zoe more than a little so, but it was more than worth it.
