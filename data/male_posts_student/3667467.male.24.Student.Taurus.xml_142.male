But this wasn't just a Blimpie's Subs, oh no. In the same room as the sub shop was a Nextel cellular phone dealership, bottled wines for sale, a candy shop, condoms (right next to the suckers on the shelves, and several giant windows where you could see the automatic car wash at work. Also, the room was half of a building where a full Dodge dealership was located. How does a room make any sense? So in conclusion, if I were to anthropologically study the people of Akron, Ohio based on this store I would see wine and clean cars, condoms and kids' candy, and cell phones and automobiles. And I would think to myself, "These people have no laws."  Today starts the daily Random Quote. At the end of each post I will quote something I read or heard that day that I think will stand alone as an interesting statement:  "Fred's always dickin' around with lunch meat." Dave Hill
