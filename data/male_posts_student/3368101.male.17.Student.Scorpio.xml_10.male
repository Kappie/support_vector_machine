Spain were lucky to win, Russia could have scored 3 goals in like 15 minutes. Torres looks like to be player who will reach great heights in the future, I think Manchester United should seriosuly consider sticking a bid infor him, the kid is only 20. I understand last year Man Utd put in a 20 million bid in for him but it was rejected.  Tonight, France against England. I want England to win, and they have th epotential. But come on people, this is France, they've got a star-studded squad, Henry, Pires, Viera and idance are just a few class players they have.  I have decided that I will give blood. It is an important thing to do in my opinion, a ridiculous amount of people die each year from the hospital not having enough blood - how sad. So i'm going to do my bit.  I am also from now, going to give much more generously to worth while charities. Charities that help people in Africa for instance. 1 in 3 children die every minute in Africa from a disease which can be stopped going around. The medication to prevent it only costs around £1-2.  Around 2 million children will die this year from diseases in Africa. There are over 60 million people in the UK. If just 1 in 6 people donated £1 to a charity which helps figt disease inAfrica, imagine the amount of innocent lives that would be saved. Our country, and other powerful countries should be spending money on helping them.  Instead, Tony Blair spends billions on a war in Iraq to find WMDs which were never there, gives himself a £47,000 pay rise - why, because he can.  The big loser over the sea, George Bush, gives Billions to NASA, so they can go and explore space, ok, yeah, it should be done, but there are more immediate and pressing issues in the world.  I also hope that Michael Moore's film documentary of G Dubbya,, Farenheit 9/11 is released in the UK - I so badly want to see it.  Right, im going out for a bit.  I'll update tomorrow and tell you about my first day at work.  Currently listening 2: Michael Jackson - Break of Dawn
