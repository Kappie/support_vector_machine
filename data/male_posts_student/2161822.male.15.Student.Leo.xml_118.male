Maybe even a tad bit more fun than that day I sat in a bucket of needles watching paint dry. I can't wait until summer.

Now I will leave you all with a statement made by our own Adam Paris in Theology class: You know what Jesus really said when he was breaking the bread? Jesus:"I can't believe Dominos couldn't deliver tonight." Apostle:"Jesus, let it go man." Jesus:"No I wanted to treat you well and the Dominos man couldn't deliver and ...."  Listen to H.I.M.
