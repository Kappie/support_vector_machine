How come everybody is so cock when using the internet? People seem to think that when they log onto the internet its like starting up some fantasy role playing game where they can do anything they want without consequences, they dont grasp the concept that if they offend people they cant just dissconnect and forget about it because one day theyre gunna offend someone who owns a car, a bad temper and some spare time, and even if they live far away theyre gunna get their ass kicked.   I love to turn up on someones door stop and go hey i'm John, remember me you called me a cunt cos i killed you whilst we were playing Counterstrike!?   Wheres his friggin gun now prick? I bet he's some scrawny sexless git as well. People like that should be banned from the internet.
