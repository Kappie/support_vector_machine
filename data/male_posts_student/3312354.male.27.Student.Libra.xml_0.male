So, last night he leaves a message on the answering machine at rival candidate Jon Huntsmans Jr.'s campaign offices. He proceeds to threaten the Huntsman team by telling them that "we have serious shit on Huntsman Sr., so you better not do any negative campaigning or we'll use it."   The Huntsman team then, of course, releases the tape to the media and Stokes looks like a total dumbass. He's been trying to say that it was a "heat of the moment" type thing and that he regrets it. My question is, is it possible to run a clean campaign? Seriously, even the best candidate always seems a bit slimy and dishonest to me. With the possible of exception of John McCain. I like that guy.
