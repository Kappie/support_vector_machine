Now, I've been invited to be in friendster for almost a year now and I'd thought it was a dating service. Heck I see 'alot of Dilimanians roaming around as if it was a reunion web. That's why Mando hasn't been paying much attention to other groups, ehehehe. Eniweyz I'm in!    Pablo: - Do you wanna join the soulsanctum, yahoo groups? Its a soulgathering group of heathens, including me, headed by the Daemon himself. Topics or no topics, you'll mostly get to know most of their mood swingz just by the messages they make. So how 'bout it?   T'all: --- Friendster accounts pls! It's Invite or get invited! The more the merrier!
