Well, the music they were playing was only just on the verge of hearing - just on that edge which means it is not generally noticeable.  The term for this is subliminal marketing - a form of hypnosis.  In it's positive sense, subliminal messages can aid our lives greatly -  urlLink there are even products out there which will help you as you work!     In a negative sense, subliminal messages can harm us - the music they were playing was of this sort.  The lyrics were based on sadness and pain - which decreases the overall happiness of our society.
