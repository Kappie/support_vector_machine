Now I just wanna let my feelings flow in MY blog. She's so darn cute, even some goddess of beauty could not even compare to her. Holdon a second, she IS my goddess of beauty. She's also darn gregarious, yet I feel like a piece of *ahem* beside her. Why, you ask? My mind goes blank when I'm like 6 feet away from her,could do nothin butto admire her beauty. Like I've stated in my 1st post, I've got a pretty low self esteem, which is killing me now. What's worse, she knows about me liking her and she's beginning to avoid me. How's my feeling now? Depressed and i feel like crap... Did I mention that she was my 1st love? Always 100% in my mind.
