I am also getting tired of listining to Tom McGraws voice...   *sigh* like I said though I am feeling better I talked to folk and I kinda cleared my head. So I am thankful.    While I was thinking though...(more like after the first four games of solitare.) I thought that I MIGHT stop updating  this site for a while and just start writing in my Notebook...I think. The decision hasnt been made yet. Even though it is nice that my friends can see how I am feeling on a daily basis.  Once again I still have too think. So if I do not update for a while people do not fear...I am fine...      (^_^)  I guess...  Onto random ranting of the moment...  If the Beastie Boys are like 40 years old...How come they are not Beastie Men?  If a shark crossbreeds with a monkey would it be called a Mark...or a shunkey?  If a woman has the excuse of PMS for mood swinging...What do men get?   IF people really do suck...How come there is not as much sex in the world?  IF People are ass'...why are there no half-people, half-donkey people?    Why isn't our house as blessed as others when my Dad is always saying "God Bless it!"?  Why is there no Animal Olypics?   If there are alot of populare bands...How come I don't like any of them?  Why did Eminem name himself after candy?   Was he born Eminem and the candy was named  after him?   Dose he have a soft chocolate inside?  Since God gives the gift of life, and then takes it back...Dose that make him an Indian giver?  Were is the Blue Man Group from?   Did God make TV?   If so did Satan make commercials?   Why do parents tell children babys come from the stork...Why not a pidgeon...or Robert DeNiro?   Why are people stupid enough to be contolled by plants?  Who is smarter...People or plants?   Why didn't God give dog apposable thumbs?   What would Miss Piggy's and Kirmit the Frog's baby look like?   If they got married would Miss Piggy be called Miss Piggy the Frog?  If Britney Spears was never on Micky mouse Club would she still be famiouse?  If Mickey Mouse was actually named Mortamer mouse would she still have joined Mortamer Mouses Club?   What was Jane addicted to?   What was simple about the plan?   well now that they are not getting funny any more... Thats it for now....I will post whenever I do... Caio!
