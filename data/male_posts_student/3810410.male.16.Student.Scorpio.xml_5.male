This is like out of the movies But I am the one who losses all  What if I could win? Would I be the head honcho? Or would I still be who I am  The one who can’t take “No.”  I’d do anything for you to notice  When I am around But you could care less I see The vacant expression is showing And I know when to say quit But you and I both know that I won’t let you go Well when all is said and all is done I will still be standing  When all is defeated and has been overcome I will still be standing  I will be waiting for you
