Well, the younger of my older sisters came back home from Bristol University for the summer, which is nice. Although she's going back in September, but at the same time, the other of my sisters is also going too University, in Birmingham, so it looks like I'll be an only child after this summer... Just me and my parents. Wow, that will be fun. Sisters are always useful for buying you stuff, and giving you lifts places, and they never hit you like brothers do.  So what else is there to say...? I've been doing a bit of maths revision earlier this morning, and a bit yesterday; it doesn't look so hard. As long as I do more revision later today and tomorrow, it should be a fairly easy exam, with only one or two quesitons I can't do, usually the 'prove this equation is true or not' question, that I can never do. Most of the other quesitons should be straightforward though. Groan... I've got a business exam on Monday too, in the afternoon after maths. The case study exam! Dun dun duuuuun. Well, at least it's not as bad as the last paper, which will be on the Monday after next, the 28th. That WILL be terrible. And after the maths,  urlLink Megatrobe  will get to go home, and I will have to stay at school with  urlLink nonnesuch . Oh well, it could be worse *jinx* *looks at exam timetable to see a further 10 business exams taking place through the summer* *It's worse*. Aaaaaaanyway. I probably should revise for the business exam, but I doubt I will, until Monday, during the 3 hour gap between the exams. Although, this paper was instead of coursework, and I do think that the exam is better than coursework. Well, it's quicker anyway.  7 EXAMS TO GO! WOOO! Damn  urlLink Dickybod , who has only 4.   Weather:  sunny, bright, a few clouds  Reading:  Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban - read quite a bit more this morning  Listening to:  Some Matrix quotes - The Architect speech at the moment  Watching:  Malcom in the Middle yesterday, rather good.  Confused about:  Areas under graphs  Annoyed with:  Business studies  Mood:  Satisfied
