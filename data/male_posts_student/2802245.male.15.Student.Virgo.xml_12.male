Decided that there was no point so I wandered around a bit and realised that in truth, there was absolutely nothing to do...   So I went back to the bus stop and decided to take a round trip around the City Hall. Major bad idea as while I was a-wandering a huge...mmm... make that *HUGE*.... crowd built up waiting for the concert... I decided to go throught the crowd since it didn't look like it was going to be that hard, but I made one mistake in that I left out the fact that I had a large school bag to carry as well.  Uh oh...  After about 15 minutes of "excuse me", "thanks", "could I get across please", I finally made it through...  Phew...  That is one thing I'm not trying again...  Of course the ground was a complete mess...  Crisp Packets Straws Bottles It was sticky too...  hmm I think I'll stick in a Philip joke now... but I don't think he reads this so I won't bother or maybe...
