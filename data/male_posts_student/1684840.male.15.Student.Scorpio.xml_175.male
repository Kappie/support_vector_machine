I asked for help but it was no use, the forum is dead.  Some pathetic error about the MySQL database not being found.  It was a good forum as well...    I sat down a bit earlier to read a bit of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  Time flew by as I read through about 4 chapters, then decided to put it down.  I might watch a movie tonight with mum or go out.  I was supposed to be going out around now but alas, Sam and Craig are nowhere to be seen    What is it with that, a simple phone call would be nice      SHIT!  They're here LMAO... I'm off out, cya!
