Funny, I don't recall Bush gassing a certain ethnic group in the Southern part of America? Do you? Hmm...must have missed that one on FoxNews. According to links on the Drudge Report, Saddam  still  refers to himself as "Saddam Hussien Al-Majid, President of The Republic of Iraq." Ok, first off, Iraq was NOT a Republic under this nut jobs power, it was a Socialist Totalitarian Dictator Ship...but socialists like to cover up there true meanings with fancy pretty words, like "Republic."   When the charges were brought to him during the arraingment at Camp Victory, one of his MANY former palaces (hows that for irony?)he refused to accept the charges with out a lawyer present, as if they might go away when he showed up. When asked about Kuwait he said, referring to himself in the third person, "How could Saddam be tried over Kuwait that said it will reduce Iraqi women to 10-dinar prostitutes? He defended Iraq's honor and revived its historical rights over those dogs." For one thing, anybody who likes to refer to themselves in the third person is NOT to be trusted, its just creepy, and for another, at that point in time Iraq had no honor to defend.   There were a total of 7 charges brought against Saddam today, including killing of religious figures in 1974; gassing of Kurds in Halabja in 1988; killing the Kurdish Barzani clan in 1983; killing members of political parties in the last 30 years; the 1986-88 "Anfal" campaign of displacing Kurds; the suppression of the 1991 uprisings by Kurds and Shiites; and the 1990 invasion of Kuwait...and remember folks the Left didn't think he posed ANY threat what-so-ever. The Left...always looking out for you...when it benifits them.   Now it's time for ol' Whitey McCracka to rant! The fact that Liberals and other leftists still think it was a bad thing that we went over there, took names and kicked ass, baffles me beyond belief. How can these people look at the charges brought against this twisted individual and then look me and you in the eye and say "it was wrong, Sadaam posed no threat?" Thats what I want to know! There is a quote by the great conservative thinker Edmund Burke, "All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing." What might've happend if America had stood by and done nothing about Saddam Hussein? There is a possibility, and more then a slight one, that we would all be nothing but bones, decomposing after a massive nuclear, biological, or chemical weapon had landed smack dab in the middle of our great country.   You can call me a Fascist, you can call me a Nazi, you can call me anything you want, but do NOT disrespect MY country, MY family, MY friends, or any of MY loved ones, and expect to get off scott free. Saddam Hussein had the audasity to mess with America, and he will pay the price, as will every, single, solitary member of any terrorist organization that has the balls and out right stupidity to kill Americans.
