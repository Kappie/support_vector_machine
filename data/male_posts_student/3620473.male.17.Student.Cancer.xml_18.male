He is in florida this week, but he just called saying he got there. He was all like "make sure to welcome home michelle for me, spends lots of time with her, we should throw a party or something." I dunno, the key line in there was spend lots of time with her. So I have half my family's permission now, hehe. All I can say is it is only 71 more hours, but who is counting? ;)  *mwah*
