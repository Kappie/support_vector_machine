Clinton: "We were all laughing about it.... People who don't know him might find it hard to believe...."   Well, Bill, you got that much right; it had crossed my mind that Sandy stuffing Top Secret documents in his boxers was somewhat indicative of nefarious intent. Wow, what a relief: our former National Security Advisor wasnâ€™t criminal, just really stupid. I feel much better now.
