He claims that he is not as pro in this game as a few years back in primary school  (Juanhe  , can you confirm this  ?)      Mrs Selvan (that's our English + Literature teacher by the way - you can call her Junki or Selmo if u like! ;-o) teaches us that you can love someone with all your  LIVER  ... which means I can be liverbroken   (so sad)   ... won't I be dead by then since the liver is one of the most important organ in the body?     The science is the most boring lesson ever ... the relief teacher (fifth one this year) speaks so softly that he is barely audible and no one can understand what he is teaching ... i think he will overtake Aymie Lim (geog. teacher) as Word + PowerPoint king ...
