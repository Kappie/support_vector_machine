But their game have improved remarkably since then and the first hour against Netherlands where their best so far.   Portugal got into the lead after a header by Ronaldo in the 26th minute and in the 58th, Maniche extended to 2-0 after a beautiful strike. The Dutch's regained some strength after a Portuguese own goal five minutes later and Netherland pushed forward, trying to get the second goal. They had some opportunities but didn't reach far enough.  My Man of the Match: Luis Figo  Greece - Czech Republic 1 - 0 (silver goal)  The Czechs started out completly different compared to their match against Denmark. This time they attacked immediately after kick off. They hade some really good chances but after their playmaker Pavel Nedved got forced off due to an injury, Greece got higher up on the pitch. Both teams had a fair amounts of chances but the Czechs where a little bit closer to get the first. Never the less, after 90 minutes the match were still tied at 0-0 and silver goal started.   Greece started SG in an attacking style, creating good opportunities and were eventually awarded a corner which Dellas could head into the net. At that point were there only seconds remaining of the first SG half and the Czechs didn't have the time to equalize.  My Man of the Match: Jan Koller.
