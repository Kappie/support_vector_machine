Today, since I have at least 2 other company-based moans to exact in the future, I will talk about something  nice . Cats. Cats are very nice indeed. There are many reasons to like cats, and, in fact, many reasons to dislike them. It just depends on who you are, how you react, and what sort of cat you have. I recommend to everyone a particularly brilliant book by the brilliant Mr. Pratchett (and artist) called "The Unadulterated Cat". It's about real cattiness, how only cats which express certain characteristics are  Real  cats. Other ones are just balls of fur.  I shall quote a little from the book, and hope I don't get lynched by an army of lawers in the morning: "For example, if you put an unReal cat down in front of a row of bowls of catfood, it will obediently choose the one made by the sponsors of the ad even if the others haven't got slump oil on them. A Real cat, on the other hand, will head for the most expensive regardless, pull it out onto the studio floor, eat it with guilty pleasure, try some of the others, trip up the cameraman and then get stuck behind the newsreaders' podium. Where it will be sick. And then, when its owners buy several large tins of the wretched stuff, it'll refuse to touch it ever again."  Get the idea? Now, I'm sure you would all agree that cats must come in varying degrees of Realness, therefore, whilst your pride and joy with fur may exhibit some of the characteristics outlined in the above book, it may not necessarily look like something that has been kicked in the face several times.  In my house at the present is one cat. That isn't because we have 423 of them, and the others are outside but because we only have one cat. I know he's inside because he is doing something to a table-leg behind me. We used to have 3. One was ancient, older than me, called Domino (and NO! I was not named after the cat). The other was called Cahn (or Kahn, we never really decided). My cat. A really, really cool tabby/tortoiseshell cross thing, he was cool. However, with the demise of the two above, which I won't go into, we are left with my sister's cat. Midnight. And yes, the poor animal was called "Midnight" regardless of gender. I feel somewhat sorry for it, however it is an annoying little sod, with teeth that would do a vampire proud. I  would  put a picture up, but it would scare people. Midnight is doubly scary because about a year ago, he ran into a twig, getting it stuck in his eye. So one eye is a different color to the other one. Since we only have one cat, and it's a crap cat, both my mother and I are most interested in an offer made by one of mum's friends of a little tabby kitten. I think we should get him. My dad always ends up feeding/clearing up the shit, so he doesn't like the idea much. My sister, who claims to be a super cat lover, doesn't like the idea either. This isnt because she has gone off them, but because she thinks that it will upset her beloved Midnight. What a load of bollocks.  I think it's slightly scary that one can buy cats on eBay, but there you go. All our cats come fresh from farms, or random people who have a female cat, don't want kittens and don't consider the possibilities offered by many modern vets. You know what I mean.  Tell everyone about  your  cats! In the comments below!  No abuse!  P.S. If you don't like cats, go away. P.P.S I had a  haircut ! -- Dom Out
