Yes, I did say that I wasn't going to write anymore, and I still am not sure whether I want to or not, but I'm going to anyway, just because Brittany is so awesome!  I'm actually talking to her right now on MSN...HI BRITTANY!  Uh, Tina, I don't know if you'll ever read this, but, if you do, I'm sorry for writing that, I didn't mean to write that, I just couldn't think of a better word at the time because it was really early....I'm sorry.   I don't mean to be immature, I just am, I mean come on, I PLAY WITH LEGO'S!!  You don't get much more immature than me, and I'm sorry for that.  I have to be myself, otherwise...who am I???  And if that means you disliking me for being immature and self-centered, than, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to try and ruin your reputation or anything, I just put the words that came to my mouth, and those happened to be them, because my vocabulary wasn't working at the moment.  Like I said before, this is my little chunk of Happiness, and I'm going to try and write whatever I feel like writing, but..I have found that for me it is harder to NOT care than it is to care....which I must admit, sux sumtimes.....but at other times it can be really nice, like when people share things with me, that's really nice....why can't you people trust me?!?!?!?!? :-P  ON A LIGHTER NOTE!! I just got home from church and i got a new blet from ShopKo, and it's really kool, it has flames on it, I like it.....and I got a new BIONICLE!!!  God I'm lame, but I sure do enjoy being lame....hm...I can't think right now, maybe i'll have one of my 22 Zebra cakes....maybe that'll help me think, either way.....I'm fresh out of stuff to write....I'll let you go back to your fun, adventure-packed lives....PEACE!  Spense
