At least the ones on TV anyway.  Two people come to mind, Matlock (Andy Griffith) and Bob Barker. Trust me, I haven't lost my mind.  You see, Matlock is the badass who doesn't quit, and doesn't lose. Consider him the Justin Timberlake of senior citizens. Not only is he the only old person that cusses, but nobody ever beats Matlock. He's clever too, and if he was a boxer, he would be the heavyweight champion of the world.    "Matlock being happy because he kick ass."  Bob Barker is a badass too. He never gets pissed off, even though there are total gits on "The Price is Right". On top of this, he's witty in spite of the fact that he should be senile. Just about everyone knows who Bob Barker is, cuz he's on the best game show ever. It's totally awesome.    "Bob Barker can put up with shit like there's no tomorrow."  In conclusion, respect old people because not only are they badass, but they can surf, do extreme sports, and jam out to heavy metal music.
