(I think it's possible that I have seen too many of my male friends in tights, what with Marten in the talent show last year and Levi's Cpt. Character.) But geez-- you were home at 8:47? That's not a proper Hell Week! I want to borrow My Ishmael when you're done if I may. Nicole- yes, I will never forget me dancing in my slip and make-up to Chicago in the dressing room, either. :) That was probably one of my favorite parts of the whole play because, well, how often do we get to do that in real life? hehe... Next week I'm going to figure out the deal with my title scheme. Be patient with me till then.  In other news, I got a college application turned in this week! Go me! Yar! This Be a Superball!     ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?
