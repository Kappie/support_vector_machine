I don't want to know anyway. Bah. Maybe I'm too sensitive. I can't take jokes? -_-" Entah lah, apa aku nak. I'm trying hard to forget that particular thing, so I could stop bugging myself. I'm so blur. Problems are coming again. I'm losing all my friends, again. Or should I say, I don't have any? Indeed, fingers could count how many real/true friends I had before. Perhaps, one hand is more than enough to know how many true friends I've had before. Plus, I guess Darren is leaving me, sooner or later. I just don't know. I do think everything has an end. It just depends on, whether the middle of that 'everything' is sweet, or a living hell. And whther it has an happy ending, or a torturing ending. Actually, I stil don't know what I want. -_-" I'm looking at other people, feeling envy, and asking myself, why they could have what they want, or perhaps, they are not desperate to have something/someone, but they got it, automatically. I just don't know. I think jealousy in me, is getting stronger and stronger. I might turn either evil, or crazy, someday. Let's see. I'm so the great in giving people advices, but I can't tell myself what to do, and I don't have anything/anyone to guide me. Let's see what else my problem is. Studies, love and yada yada. Basically, all the problems came from me, myself. Like study, I don't even bother to fnish up my homework. And I don't think I could ever move my body to my books, as exams are not here yet. I'm a last minute fella. I can't do things until its last minute, and time is a factor. And love. bah, dont ask why, I seriuosly have no idea why I'd coupled with John. Great question. Even my sister asked me so, since I've got so many problems with him. Should I say it's my problem, or his? Should I say, I'm asking too much, or he did not do his part, as a boyfriend? I don't know. Argh. I think I'm making things big, and I knew I shoudn't. But what can I do? Everything just pops into my mind when I'm alone. When I'm alone, doing nothing, what I could do is, think. Sometimes, maybe it's just me, to think too much. But sometimes, I think I'm right. It's just my problem. Meh. Who cares about me anyway? I'm sick of people who pretend to care about me. I know, having someone to care about you, no matter is real or not, is sometimes touching. But, poo, I'm selfish. I'd like someone who really care about me to care about me. I'm sensitive. I can't stand lies. If someone lied to me, and if its very seriuos, I forgive, but will never forget. The trust will never be there again, no matter how long it is. There'll still be a wall, between me and that particular person, if he/she lied. La. I don't know what I want right now. I don't seem to miss John, but if you asked me to break up with him, I think I couldn't do it. Please don't ask why. Sometimes, I'm madly in love with him, but sometimes I don't feel like looking at him. Sometimes, I missed him more than everything!! But sometimes, I just don't feel like talking to him. To be honest, sometimes, I missed Darren more than him. My sister even told me, why I coupled with John, but not Darren. Excellent question. I told my sister, simply because he is my brother, and he is younger than me. After that, I thought of it, alone. Asking myself, why I coupled with John, when I missed Darren more? Why I'm with John, when I think I don't love him, and I couldn't continue any further with him? Why I'm with him, when I know he flirts around and actually don't care about my feelings? Why I'm with him, when I know he loves bragging, and will never be my dream boyfriend? Why wHy whY and why.. WHY?? Everything comes into my mind, suddenly, and I can't give myself a good reason. Sometimes, I seriuosly miss Darren, I don't know why. I once, tried to hate him, but it doesn't work, and will never work. I missed him even more when I hate him. -_-" I hate him  Pah. Guess something like this, make me feel  a little  better. Anyway, I've been thinking about the farewell party next month. And I'm looking forward to it, -_-" don't ask why. Maybe because I'm more into prefects this year, plus it is going to be held at night, till midnight! Wow, rock it baby, rock it! Just hope we'll have loads of fun on that day. Wee... I'm just lovin' it. =P bah, 30 mins updating this blog. -_-" Is it long? and damn, my oral. Teacher is so unfair, to put the first guy [from namelist] in class, and the last girl in class go first! Unfair uNfair! unFair!! unfAir!!! unfaIr!!!! unfaiR!!!!! and UNFAIR!!!! Poo! I hope teacher give me chance to have a little excuse, which is 0.001% of chances. Meh. Tats.
