It didn't help that I went up and down the stairs in the Library Tower a few times... nor does the fact I live upstairs.  I'm also extremely tired since I went to sleep at about 4 AM.    Q1  Laine: Name your biggest regret in life.  Answer: I think that I regret a lot less in life now than I did when I was younger. I tend to act more immediately than when I was in high school or even my early years in college. I'm also significantly more open and vocal about my own life and feelings. I don't really hide much. If there is one thing I really regret is hurting people I care about. Guilt is the most painful form of regret.   Next question!  ***
