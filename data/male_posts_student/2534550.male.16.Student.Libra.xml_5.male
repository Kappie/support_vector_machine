We were jumping up and down joyfully, and then realized we needed to practice badly...  He's a percussionist, turned brass geek. Well...contra...sooooo he needs some help. Lol. Dun ditta dun! Chels to the rescue!  Sadia is getting super excited too. She loves me, and is my gurl, has been since she was a wee freshman. We have a wonderful relationship, sharing tuna salad or fruit snacks or potstickers in Jazz Band, hiding behind our stands from the sub. She idolizes me, (trying not to brag, honestly), she's told me she does. And that's totally awesome, cuz I'm trying to create a positive female brass player influence for my girls. And for the boys too, so they can see that males aren't the only ones proficient in the brasswinds.   I'm working on building up my trumpet section before I leave, something the juniors and seniors before me never did. So, bringing Sadia along this year, maybe Tyler and Vanessa the next... Vintage has a plethora of talent that just needs to be weeded out, nutured, and kept in partial sun-light...heehee...ok, it's corps... Full Sun-light.   So yeah. Posted info about the percussion camp, and it was respectively left alone. Once I get my DVD's, we'll have a DCI party and get even more hyped.  Woop!   (pardon, I just had a soda... probably should cut back and start taking Gatorade intravenously)
