Tomorrow will be fine nonetheless.  It sucks that Tyke is a little sick right now.  He has a sore throat.  Hopefully it isn't strep.  Everytime Tyke begins to get a sore throat he fears strep because he has gotten it so many times.  And it always comes on slowly like it is just a sore throat but then quickly hits him and he is dead.  A sore throat is just killer.  You almost always notice it because of its pervasive nature.  Damn you throat.  Why does Tyke have to swallow?!?!!  Man, it was so hot out today.  It was gorgeous.  It is on these days that Tyke really wishes he had a sun roof for it would have gotten immense usage with Tyke driving quite a bit today.  Lunch at Pie was hot and they sat outside on one of the benches with Dotti and Purdy as they went there as well as the regular crew.  In 6th period they burned stuff and went outside and that was just about all.  After school Tyke picked up Jew and went to Amed's for some bball.  They were joined by Maniak and the gang took on some Asians from Newport.  They won half the time.  The Asians were pretty good but really they weren't that smart for having more skill than Tyke.  Tyke knew the game better so he used that to his advantage.  But they still could school Tyke with the dribble on occasion and had more strength and size down low.  It was a good match though.  And a great time under the sun.  Tyke went home and later on he had to go out and get his own dinner as his parents were gone.  He drove to Taco Time on the plateau by himself and then drove back and ate it at home by himself.  And he listened to his completed 80s mix.  It is not up to Tyke's usual standards for a mix but it is still good.  And some good humorous songs are on there so it is enjoyable nonetheless.  You can hear it sometime.  Making cds takes a while and is boring.  Oh well, music is life.  Tyke is definitely a music junkie.  So tomorrow is Tuesday.  Then...WEDNESDAY!!!!
