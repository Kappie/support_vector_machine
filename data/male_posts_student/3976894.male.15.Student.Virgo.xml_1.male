I dunno...I guess I'm just stressed cuz I'm leaving in 2 days. My flight leaves at 2:00 PM and I'm pretty sure that it is going to be one long flight.   I am letting my buddy Rudy borrow my PS2, since i can't take it to Peru. In return, he is letting me borrow 29 GBA games. It's alot, and i don't think i will be able to get through half of them. Oh well, I'm pretty sure that a lot of the games I will not even be interested in. But I'm looking forward to playing a lot of Zelda games, like the old NES version and Four Swords on my GBA, along with these japanese unreleased-in-the-USA version. He is a rich guy, so I'm getting hooked up. Freakin' awesome.  Speaking of GBA, my Brother in-law bought a GBA SP Classic edition to use on the plane. After this whole trip, he is giving it to me, which means I probably will sell my old one to an idiot at my school who will buy it for $70. I like the classic edition of GBA SP because it looks just like the original NES's rectangle control. It looks pretty cool. The cool part about all of this is that my sister got a 50 pack of AA batteries from her work. I'll be entertained at least!  Well I feel like playing GunBound right now so I will blog later! See ya People.
