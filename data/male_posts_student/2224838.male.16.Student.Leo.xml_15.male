This part of the story definitely carries the most emotional value because it ties the character development from the first two parts. In this way, The Lord of the Rings has more value as one story rather than three. Since I've read the book it's hard for me to believe that the trilogy is actually concluded. I feel like re-reading the book a few more times to get a better view of each part. In my opinion, both the movie and book are classics.
