I am grateful for the two or three people who do read this, and I hope I can continue to entertain or anger you depending on your particular views.  I feel as if I am about to navigate out of a long and dark storm at work.  I can see the light on the horizon, and the waves are subsiding as we get closer to Emancipation Day - Wednesday July 14th is the final day I will have to deal with a particular person here.  I regret that things have reached this point, but based upon all that I've heard regarding her ability to interact with integrity, this isn't entirely my fault.  The important thing is I will be free from a great source of stress and unhappiness, even as I wish her well on her new job.  This is one of those situations where the magnitude of the unhappiness isn't obvious until it is removed, so my disposition in general has improved remarkably.  I returned to hockey last night, starting another 8 game season.  Unfortunately, we lost in overtime.  The teams have been mixed this season, so I had to face a few of my old team mates, who seemed to have a good understanding of my weaknesses based upon how they were exploited.  The humidity on the rink last night could best be described as 'Soul Rending', and I think I'm still dehydrated twelve hours later.  It's just going to get worse from here on, so if blogging suddenly ceases, you know what will happen.  Jeopardy-boy racked up $52,000 last night, tying his previous high score in a relentless display of knowledge.  He should pass $1 million tonight, I think.  Maybe it's getting dull to some, but I love watching him crush the enemy, drive them before him, and hear the lamentations of their women.   More later...
