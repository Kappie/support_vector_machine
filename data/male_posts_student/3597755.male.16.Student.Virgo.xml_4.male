I don't have a mind on my own so I'll just buy what other people tell me to buy.  (Herr toecrusher) * You know what cow. You're stupid. Buying expensive clothing because it's the current fashion is a perfect example why the world is shitty. Sel-improvement by buying shit we don't need advertised by marketeers is masturbation. (yeah, I like fight club)  Seriously, there has to be a point where you stopped thinking when you're buying expensive (brand) clothing because marketeers or the vogue tells you to.  If you buy ordinary, non-brand, shoes you don't have to pay much. If you buy the exact same shoes but then with, for instance, a nike-sign on it you have to pay much more.  - Hey, look at my new flashy nike-shoes. They cost almost nothing. I only had to take another 200 Euro loan. * Hey, look at my regular identical copies of your nike-shoes. Just 75 Euro. And look at the 15 cd's I could buy from the difference...  Don't get me wrong. I don't wear identical copies of nike shoes. I hate those shoes. And no, even for a 16 year old, 200 Euro is not a lot of money. For the stupid dipshits who do buy nike shoes it is. They're usually not well educated, have shitty jobs and hardly make any money.  Instead of the usual song text lyric thingy I finish this piece with a line from fight club: Marketing makes us work jobs we don't want to do buying shit we don't need...
