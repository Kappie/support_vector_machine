Why? beats me. I'm going to try Windows 98 again, and if that doesn't work, I'll try to find a copy of NT. And if that doesn't work...I don't know what I will do. Probably buy a cheapo server off of eBay or something. Or maybe buy an old PII system from work cheap. That would do the job.  In other news, my dad finished up his restoration of our old pickup. I have to say, holy crap it looks good. Plus, it runs well too. I cannot believe how amazing it looks. I'll be driving either that or the Jimmy to school. I can't wait to drive it some more. The only problem that I can find is that the legroom is about half what it used to be. The new seats are a lot more forward than the old ones. I will live though, nothing major.  My obsession with Rainbow Six: 3 continues. I've been playing mostly regular survival lately, but some team survival and mission as well. I played it pretty much all day. There are just not words to describe this beautiful game. Except maybe one: scrumtrulescent.
