From that moment onwards education becomes punishment for both sides.   I do not know if it is sign of times but when I first started my degree it  was not lack of interest but lack of work that made us/ me fail. But what  I am seeing in some od the people that I am supposed to help in labs nowadays  is an absolute lack of initiative in the learning.  The French have wonderful expression to descrive their state of mind "Les  assistees" which translates on to the assisted since the require someone  else's input for them to do something. They require someone to think for  them even to break the tasks in to small repetitive elements that are  trivial to apprehend if they are not already known.  In this priorly described sorry mind set the possibilities of improving are  greatly reduced since any input has to be digested before hand by someone  else. The raw world or knowledge out of a book seems to be too unreachable  for them. From their insight it looks like the world is punishing them with  things they can not apprehend.  On the teachers side the over simplification of things frustrates the  educator as it sees that less and less of its skills are being required.  That there is not much discussion or input beyond a set of over simplified  teaching materials. For her/ him it is also punishment as the field is no  longer explored in the classroom. Knowledge  is only poured with no  delicatesse whatsoever. Education is also punishment through frustration for the educator.  What a sorry estate of affairs.   At this stage there are two things left to do. Jump backwards accepting that  things will never change and switch to drone mode with the help of the usual  intoxicant. Or jump forwards and turn punishment into even more punishment by  making the student face up with the true complexities of the subject and letting  them deal with them. The jump will not be for the faint hearted yet it is  necessary for their own sake. This jump in quality will also be difficult for the educator since it will  have to go against the flow and challenge the students on to further and  further complex subjects and at first will encounter a lot of resistance. But in due time and with the right kind of help it is believe that anyone  going through higher education should be capable of pulling their act  together or are not worthy of the privileges a degree offers in further life.  As expected the burden falls on to the educator because s/he knows or should know better what to do and how to keep the pupils interested in the subject.  However apathy, and not only in the academic world, is on the increase. Young  people are turning on to mindless consumers more worried about what colour should their mobile phone be rather than the sorry state the planet is now in. However there is only a certain amount an educator can do. The education on the  citizenship and civic matters ought to come from the family where the scope for cultural differences lies.  Further education is not about learning to think. It is about having already  learnt to explore ones ideas learning about someone else's and taking them  further in order to contribute back to the knowledge base. Four years is far too short for learning to think and do something useful with it. One should start to think on ones feet in late teenage-hood when the world is beginning to be perceived as an adult. Not when all the burden of society has already fallen on you since  you will never have had the courage to think for yourself without taking in to  account any external influences. The same that youth is supposed to mindlessness I advocate for a youth in which ideas have to emerge and start to shape your life as the obligations of adult life will be hard enough for you to diverge from  a true free thinking exercise.  Think and train your youth to think as soon as possible as they will never be  ready for the complexities of the real world. Educate and do not be afraid to  overwhelm since either a limit will be reached, and hence acknowledged, or the  challenge will be taken over and conquered.
