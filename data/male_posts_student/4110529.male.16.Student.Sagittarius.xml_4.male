I do not condone perversions of the English language, and do not subscribe to “hax0r” culture, nor do I suffer well its lexicon that consists entirely of contrived transliterations of the Latin alphabet.  However, the names "Perko" and "Perki," long my nicknames --albeit among two seperate peer groups-- were already taken by, respectively, a procrastinator and someone who hasn't posted since he got his up.  Dope.  Anyway, I hope that this will be a productive and worthwhile use of the space on Blogger's servers, and not some kind of homage to inane and crass humor of the type that pervades profiles, blogs, and firstclass resumes.  Anyway, I am tired as all hell after mon Tour de Ouestchester this afternoon, and have yet to master self governance in using the ill wifi setup which I set up recently in my house.
