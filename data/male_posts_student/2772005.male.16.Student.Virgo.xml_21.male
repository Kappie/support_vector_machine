Okay, For those of you who cannot still understand, My Family Is Voting For The BJP!!!!!!!!!! Oh Horrors. The shame of it. The family of the greatest fan of Indira Gandhi voting for the BJP. My mother actually had the supreme audacity of saying that the Congress was responsible for India's woes.  I live in a family full of philistines and wannabe Praveen Togadias. God, do not forsake me!!!
