The day was pretty strieght foward...it started very early, about 5 AM...i woke cause of a dream i was having, which was a pleasant suprise, cause i usually don;t get alot of dreams anymore....kinda wish i had alot more...(i love DREAMS, ther the bomb diggity...but thats for later)...anyway, in this dream, there was a girl.....acutally, it was gina from the gym...and sorry....it's not what you think, we weren't doing the dirty, stuffing the taco, dancing the horizontal tango...it was acutally alot worse...it was what i really want, what i want to live for...what i'm here to do...just..be inlove...it's hard to explain.  I mean, i love/want sex just as much as the next guy...acutally, probably MORE than most guys, but i'm definitly not all about that, i need more, i need the love.  I love just being with people, i want that feeling when you find out both of you like the same things, i like feeling proud to walk next to someone, i like that whole thing...call me the romantix type, but hnestly, thats totally what i am.  I just have to have that feeling, or else i won't liek the relationship...i also love flirting, and saying "i love you"...but, obviously..thats not a very good combinatin.  I'm definitly NOT a player, everyone could tell you that...Mr. Mandel could tell you that..but i mean, if i see someone doing it at me, i'm gonna come back with some.  I dun think alot of freinds have seen this, and that makes sense, cause i dun do it alot, but when i do, it's bliss, i just love it! i juss wish i did it more...ya know? but like i said in an earlier entry, all the girls i'm into are taken, out of my league, or alot older than me.  Most of the times, all three, so as you can tell....i dun flirt that often.  so, ya, i guess thats all about me and my thoughts of flirting.  Anyway, as for saying "i love you" alot...it can only be described as a curse. i mean, i like making people feel good, i love it, i mean, literally, if i make NO one laugh in anyway at anytime during any day, my day would be WRECKED...like, literrallly, i get depressed...i feed of the emotions of others...not many people know that. Deep inside, i'm a seriosuly complicated man...well, anyway, ya, i like saying i love you...thats why i have such high standards when it comes to girls...i want to be able to say i love you, and really mean it....i want them to say it back, and for them to really meet it....ya, prolly won't happen, but atleast i can except it...gotta give that one to me. i mean, SHIT, i say i love you atleast 20+ times a day to my cats and parents...never know when they'll leave ya.  Anyway, back to the day...my love life can be saved for a future entry....ok, so i have this dreams, where i'm falling in love with gina...now WAIT, lemme just recap this to myself....dun know ANYTHING about this girl...barely talk to her, and i'm having a dream about falling with love with her? how does that work you might be asking yourself...well, i'll tell you how...because, phsyically she;s what i like...and because i dun know her, i just filled in all my other "perfect" features in my mind, and had a dream about THAT because obviously, springs coming, and love is on my mind....brains protect the body, keep it healthy, and by doing things like that, it does it's job good. So ya, anyway, the dream is great...i mean, i'm talking awsome, i dun remmeber much, but i know i liked it, which is wierd cause i usually remmeber all my dreams (i still remmebr dreams from like 5th grade...) anyway, so ya, wake up around 5, gotta take a piss...take it, go back to sleep...wake back up around 9, and just sit in my bed, wishing my dream was real...not in the sense of the girl, but wishing i was at that level of a relationship with a girl that i really liked.  well, after that, go online, determined to do APUSH, but dun do it at all.  Andy IM's me asking me if i wanna go to the gym at 3....now, at first i was reluctant....i was still kinda tired, didn;t eat anything, and juss wanted to chill...but i smacked myself out of it, and went.  Now, to my suprise, guess who was working the front counter today? Gina.  Ya, i was pretty damed suprised, unfortunatly, she was talking on the phone, like i see her most of the time, so i couldn't really say anything to her, but i bet i coulda have pulled off some smooth shit...i'm good at that...laughter is the best way into a ladies heart ya know...i relay on that saying...but anyway, i go to the locker room, change, go back to the front where benny and andy are juss arriving, we run, then stretch, then start working out...it was pretty funny, cause i got the frist machine on the side, so i could see her the whole time...and ya, i guess i'm pretty inlove with for, but i fall in love every 3 seconds...i'll get over it....so anyway, we did the whole pumping iron thing, and then i came back home.  We tried to get a game of axis and allies (sorry, no link...to lazy to link it) but it fell through.  After that, i've pretty much been here all day, looking a pictures i want to use for my Hello picture. (sorry, no link again) so ya, thats about it.  I'm just here....doind absolutly nothing....damn, saying that is kinda depressing huh?...absoulutly nothing.....whoa....ya, so BACK TO THE CHICKS!!  so ya....no g/f....sucks.  I need one, have none.  The closest thing right now is this chick in Ecuador named gabriella.  I had a fling with her back durng the summer of 7th grade...(she was my first kiss)...so ya, we got back in touch, and we always talk dirty to each other, saying what well do next time we meet, all that shit...truth is, i think she has seriouly has feelings for me...but i really don...i have no idea why..i mean, she is pretty hot..but maybe its the fact the she's a SLUT that's turning me off....ya...aww man, i'm getting pissed now...i really dun think i'm a bad catch...maybe alittle on the hairy side...but shit, jones has hairy legs, and him and sheel have been together 4ever.  Maybe i should go around playing my guitar....but i hate that, i feel like such an asshole, and when i acutally do do it, i feel like everyone else thinks i'm an asshole...maybe when i get a car i'll have bettter luck, doubt it, but i'll try. ya. o, by the way, it's 12:10 right now, and it feels like it's 8. ya.  i need to make out with someone, thats my problem, i love kissing...all i need is someone to make-out with.  Dun have to be a good kisser, i dubt i'm a good one anyway, i juss need some toungue. i need to please someone. i need to feel good. i'm acutally pretty dexterous with my tounge, and finger (ladies? any taker?) ya i need some of that. you know what i also need? balance. Libra's are aways looking for balance.  thats  why i belive in astrology...it juss makes sense...go  urlLink here.  everything they say about libra is me.  so ya, i'm tired of bitching right now, so i'm juss gonna go lay back with one of my buetiful cats and relax...maybe tonight i'll have another dream...there nice.  I literally have a MILLION things to say, but i have no way of typing it out....i think to much...so long loyal readers, write to ya tomarrow...
