I don't know whether I didn't study enough (certainly a possibility), the test was just really hard (certainly true), or I'm just getting dumber (also true), but I don't think I did too well...of course, I thought that about another test last week and did ok, so maybe I'm going through post-exam anxiety.  Nah...I didn't do well :-P  Feeling thoroughly beat-up after the test, I decided that I deserved a break - thus, I blew off Comparative and Spanish.  Instead, I went and got a hair cut (which was NEEDED, but I think it needs to grow out a little more to go with the beard better...), then stopped by home (no one was there), then stopped by church to give blood (they weren't set up yet).  So that was partially productive (but certainly moreso than going to class :)  Anyway, headed back to school and picked up Conflict Management.  I think that if I could do college over again I would love to get a Conflict Management degree...it is just SO useful (I mean, who doesn't have conflicts?).  Anyway...after class go home, mess / lazy around a little, then head over the LifeCenter to work out.  Get done working out and head over to give blood at church (now that it's open!).  Guess what?  I didn't pass the screening!  Evidently my pulse was too high (a good half-hour after I got done working out...), so they wouldn't poke me...  The rest of the night was pretty uneventful, but I did do some cooking :)  Yep...I think I'm getting pretty good at the pre-fab stuff (i.e. stir-fry, rice, cookies, etc.) - it's time to graduate to making stuff from scratch...
