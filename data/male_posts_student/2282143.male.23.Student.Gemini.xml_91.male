Sam taught me a trick on how to induce vertigo in someone using cold water.  Makes a neat feeling that I should try on Tony some time.  Pour water in ear, close eyes, count from 100 backwards by threes, get dizzy, good times.  C2.  SUCKS.  Really, when I first got it, I thought I could handle it, but the more I drank it, the worse it got.  All it is, is half classic, half diet.  Im sure thats pretty much it.  Real brain buster with that one...  You still get that nasty phenylalanine aftertaste so youre better off just drinking the diet, cause the taste is pretty much the same.  Must say Im somewhat disappointed just because I thought that it could be good.  New Found Glory.  SUCKS.  All downhill from here is worst song ever.  Or whatever you call it.  I think it was Sludge the other day (or maybe it was Fook) but pretty much it was someone on Q101 making fun of Dave Matthews voice then plays these chumps.  I mean, really.  The lead singer sounds like part of the lollypop guild.  High nasal punk/pop makes me place these guys with the likes of Avril and Good Charlotte.  Lame.  People or Orland Park.  SUCK.  "Oh no, we dont want a mosque cause the taliban is gonna move in!"  Grow up people.  Really.  What would Jesus do guys?  He would accept them and love them and blah blah blah.  But still.  Being scared of Islamic people?  What is this world coming to?  Equating terrorists to Moslims is like equating all Christians to Jerry Falwell.  Not all Christians are as big as assholes as him, and not all Moslims are gonna blow you up.  End of story, now quit your bitching.  Tortilla Soup.  RULES.  Still.  The White Sox.  RULE.  (Sorry Cubs fans)  I got to drive around some of them today at the zoo and I must say they are some of the coolest people I have met.  Not to mention as he gave me his autograph, I told Jose Valentin to kick Cleveland's ass tonight.  Then he did with that 2 run shot in the 10th that pushed us over the edge and won it for us.  I would like to claim all responsiblity for this.  No, really.  This win was all because of me and my motivational speaking (just let me have it, ok? ok? please? thanks!).  Lollapalooza (or however you spell it).  minisucks.  Was cancelled due to poor ticket sales.  I would have gone cause they did have a pretty sweet line up, but no one huge to draw the crowd.  No sales = No show.  Bummer.  That, and two day venues just dont work so well.  At least in my mind.  Make it a week or something and I will go.  Woodstockish.  I dunno.    And I do probably have alot more, but I should go to bed as it is late.  Oh yeah, my friend Julie got engaged.  She was the one who caught the bouquet at Joge's wedding.  Odd.  Maybe she is next.  She deserves a cookie.  Didnt know that acutally happened, with the tradition and all.  We even joked with the guy saying he should get a ring.  I guess he did.  Well, gotta work tomorrow, so if I figure out more, I will write manananana.  JOSE ROCK.
