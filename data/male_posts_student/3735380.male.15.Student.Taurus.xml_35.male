Soon I was swirling in a peanut buttery—okay you get the idea.  I woke up catching my brother sneaking into my room. That's rare. He was going to try to yank the covers off me again. What a moron.  Next thing, I put on my uniform. I went to work. I sat at the first window collecting money for 4 hours. Nothing special at all, except 90% of the time people gave me $20 bills, even if their total was only 50¢. That ticked me off a little.  When I got home at 7:30, I played Golden Sun for about 4 hours, then I wrote this blog.  See what I mean? Nothing eventful today.
