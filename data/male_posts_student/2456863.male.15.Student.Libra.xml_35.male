Heres one of my old poems  "The perversion of humanity" We ride to battle,  With rifles on our backs,  Grenades at our side.  The machines of destruction rumling in the abyss.   And somewhere, a baby is crying.  A baby is crying,  Nobody can hear it,  For they are busy with their killing.   We say that we fight for freedom;  Without imprisonment, how can there be freedom?  Gasping for breath, evil is nearly defeated.  The evil is getting stronger now.   And so the cycle repeats.  Anybody would see our mess,  Now we are preoccupied; the mess is invisible.  For they say, Out of sight, Out of mind.   We say we are civil,  We say we are humane.  Guns and bombs we make,  The perversion of humanity grows.   - July 10, 2003 I don't like it as much as much as some of my others but its ok i suppose
