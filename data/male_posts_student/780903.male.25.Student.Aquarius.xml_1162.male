There are 132 of us, plus one who's missing his back page (birth defect) and a few who are lopsided.  Tuesday, 4:00 PM -- Overwhelmed by the smell of toner, I passed out.  I awoke to find myself still in the same pile.  Wednesday 7:45 AM -- An elderly gentleman put me and my brothers in a box and carried us somewhere.  He smelled like sour milk.  Wednesday 8:30 AM -- The box was put down in what seemed to be a classroom.  Nervous students gathered around me, as I waited for the elderly gentleman to give me to my new owner.  This must have been what the slaves felt like.  Wednesday 8:36 AM -- My new owner is treating me badly.  He's abusive.  He folded me in half.  It really hurts.  And I'm being crushed by his laptop computer in his backpack.  This isn't fair.  I miss my box.  Wednesday 8:44 AM -- We have arrived at his apartment.  It smells like sour milk.  He burned me with coffee.  I hate him.  Wednesday 8:52 AM -- He's writing on me.  I hope it's not permanent.  Mom told me I should never get a tattoo because I'll regret it when I'm old and wrinkled and grayish-white.  Wednesday 10:15 AM -- We've been here a long time.  I don't know what's going on.  He's looking at other papers.  He likes them better than me.  I tried to get his attention by making myself fall on the floor but he ignored me.  Wednesday, 10:42 AM -- I'm still on the floor.  He hasn't noticed.  Wednesday 10:50 AM -- OUCH!  His chair just ran over me.  That's gonna leave a mark.  And no medical attention.  Crap.  Wednesday 11:15 AM -- Okay, he just picked me up and he's reading me again.  His palms are sweaty.  It's kind of disgusting.  Wednesday 12:02 PM -- More writing.  It doesn't even look like English.  Wednesday 1:12 PM -- He RIPPED me!  He TORE a piece from me!  And wrapped his chewing gum in it and threw it out.  That was my spleen, mister!  Wednesday 3:30 PM -- I'd heard the rumors but I never thought it would actually happen to me: I've been STAPLED to some fresh-out-of-the-printer exam wannabes.  He calls them his "answers," whatever that means.  Mom told me never to get my ears pierced.  This must be what it feels like.  Wednesday 4:30 PM -- Box, sweet box.  I'm back with my friends.  We've all been stapled.  I hope we're not being taken to a concentration camp now.  Wednesday 7:21 PM -- The room is dark; it smells like feet; in comes an older man with an unkempt beard and unmatching clothes.  Must be a professor.  He takes the box.  I am apparently going on a trip somewhere.  Wednesday 9:11 PM -- The professor has a nice house.  Hope he leaves the TV on.  Porn.  Wednesday 9:49 PM -- No porn, but there's a whole ream of paper in the corner -- NAKED!  And posing just for me.  You look sexy, blank paper.  Although it's a little too thick for me.  I prefer 12 lb and this is 15.  Friday 1:12 PM -- Touch me, professor!  Touch me!  Oh, how I long to be touched!  Six weeks later, Friday, 4:07 AM -- Touch me, professor!  Touch me!  It's been so long since anyone has touched me!  Saturday, 11:12 AM -- Finally, my needs are being tended.  Yeah, scratch right there, by the staple.  No, a little bit to the left.  Yeah, that's it, that's it, don't stop.  Saturday, 11:14 AM -- Why are you writing on me with RED pen?!  What do I look like??  Who do you think you are??  Saturday, 11:19 AM -- So the rumors are true.  I've just been thrown down a flight of stairs to see where I land.  Apparently I'm a B+.  So is everyone else in the box.  Sunday, 10:01 PM -- It's been a long and fruitful life, but I am at the point of no return.  The Hefty Bag on the curb.  There's no turning back.  I'm ready to go with God.  Take me when you're ready.  Monday, 6:02 AM -- He's ready.  Garbage truck approaching.  Monday, 6:04 AM -- NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Monday, 8:13 AM -- I am nearly dead.  A first-year law student approaches, picking through the McDonalds' wrappers and empty tubes of hemorrhoid cream.  He picks me up.  He wipes me off.  I am now -- I believe -- a study aide.  My parents would be so proud.
