In case you haven't heard, Rondstat broke off in the middle of her Vegas act and praised Michael Moore, saying that he preaches the truth and called him a great American.  The audience booed and many left the show.  As a result, the casino owner fired her that night and asked her to vacate the hotel immediately.  Maybe a little heavy handed, but it's his casino.  The ever-lovable Whoopi spouted off a potty-mouth tirade against Bush during a Kerry fundraiser, with Kerry and Edwards in attendance.  Slim Fast decided they didn't want to be associated with Ms. Goldberg, so they canned her the next day.  In both cases, outrage Leftists are invoking the First Amendment.  Not surprisingly, this demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the guarantees of the First Amendment, as well as a fundamental disrespect for the notion of 'private property'.  The First Amendment allows you to say anything you want without fear of persecution (although there are limits imposed by the general welfare clause, such as not being able to shout fire in a theater and all of that).  However, this freedom of persecution does not establish a right to access private property or to require someone else to continue an association against their will.  Does the Left really believe that they should be able to say anything and still force others to provide a stage or hire them to endorse a product?  Note that in both cases, the Federal Government had nothing to do with the consequences of this speech.  These are private citizens/entities exercising their own rights in response to activities they did not appreciate.  The philosophical differences between Left and Right are vast....
