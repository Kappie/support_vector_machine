But Im not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.  Besides, the teacher said I should have charged more...  I could do it for the college and get paid minimum wage or I can freelance.  The one lady, Heidi, wanted to give me $20 an hour anyways, so instead of all 60 from her, is was 15 from each for all 3 hours.  Sounds reasonable.  Good deal.  And I hope I helped alot.  They seemed to know what was going on, but now they just need to explain it on the test.  I think I could be a teacher, but I still kinda get frustrated when people dont understand even though you explain it to them 30 billion times in multiple different ways.  But still, it was a really nice feeling when they did finally get it.  So yeah, that and we did Pa Kua (Ba Gua, however you wanna spell it) walk tonight after class.  That is supposed to feel amazing, and I still dont think I get it.  Maybe Im still doing it wrong.  Oh well.  Perseverence.  Try try again.  And all that stuff.  Rock.
