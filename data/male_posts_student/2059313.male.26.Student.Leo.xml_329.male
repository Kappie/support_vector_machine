Friday night  was fun.  I got to spend some time with a great person, and I went rock climbing for the first time at The Stadium.  I had been hiking before, but nothing with real vertical walls, and the possibility of really falling.  The Gorge had a few scary possibilities, but I wasn't worried about it.   Saturday  was a fun day.  The first part was mostly lazy, and I burned a lot of CD's for someone who - for the first time, I feel - is taking a little bit of my musical taste with them.  My friends have always kind of rubbed off on me with some of their tastes in music.  But very few people have I ever musically infulenced before, so I'm helping her out a bit.  The rest of my Saturday afternoon involved visiting the "fabulous" Richmond Mall and hitting Wal-Mart.  That night, I went over to a great friend's house and hung out, watched TV, watched a movie, and watched SNL.  Too much fun. I had one of the best times I'd had in a while.   Sunday  was another fun-filled day.  Woke up and headed out to church.  After church, I stayed for a class in the basics of sound and running sound.  Very educational, and I'm really into gadgets and electronics, so I loved it.  After that, I went to help a friend move some stuff into her new house.  Then that evening I drove to Georgetown to visit with three of my good friends.  I love my friends, but that's a rough drive!  I'm always glad I go, but the drive back always is  WAY  too long  (about 40-45 minutes!) .  I came home to find one roommate asleep and the other not home (probably at his girlfriend's).  I made myself some left-over Arby's sandwhiches and talked one of my friend's home from Georgetown.  I fell asleep watching the movie UNDERWORLD.    Today is a new day, and I can't wait to start hating school again!  The weekend can't arrive too soon.
