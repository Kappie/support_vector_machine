It's not suprising that things are turned out this way. I mean it takes a lot alot of effort to live together. It's funny. There are times where i actually like going to the library during breaks becoz it's so peaceful and quiet. i can have some time of my own. my world. i immersed myself into it and indulge myself in pleasures and doing things which no ones has an opinion or comment about it. I really doing my work, studying there. am i a freak? a loner? i duno how to define it now. i do cherished the company that i have... especially when those days or nites where i do feel shite and it's always good to have someone there for you.. i am just so contradicting isn't it? am i asking for too much? or this is what life is all about. Having and creating the balance between the love and hate; good n evil. Maybe the simple solution to it is to go with the flow... am i rite?
