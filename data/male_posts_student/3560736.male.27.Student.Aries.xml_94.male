Or perhaps you'd be more interested in his thoughts on  urlLink what diversity really ought to be about .  I particularly like his thoughts on diversity. I've often thought that diversity was nothing more than a skin-deep, feel-good word. How can you possibly define something as complex as an individual human personality based solely on their color/race/economic circumstance/location of origin/political leanings or whatever parameter you choose to pigeonhole someone.  I'd be willing to bet that at most you'd be able to get a 30% success rate like that. Meaning that by categorizing someone on some convenient surface parameter you'd be able to discern maybe 30% of their viewpoints. However, I imagine that even that success rate would be diminished if you took into account nuance of opinion.  Diversity as defined by government or burocuracy is an illusion. It is something designed purely to give a demonstrable and measureable result - and you can only measure something like that through the most cursory and obvious observable traits. Skin color is a great one - you just have to look to see if someone is a different color than you are - if they are, Huzzah! you have diversity.  What a load of crap. As a psychologist I cannot imagine a more demeaning and shallow way to categorize a person. However, the unfortunate truth present is that type of categorization has become so prevelant that people are willing to let themselves be defined by the parameters of "diversity." And that is all in the name of power - if you associate and groom yourself to fit in with a category that offers certain advantages you deem worthwhile, you'll allow yourself to be categorized.  It's a poor way to run things, but I don't see it ending anytime soon.
