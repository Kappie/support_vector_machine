So instead of writting what i wrote in the previous one I'll write something else let's see. so Yesterday i learned the value of symapthy, yes i sympithise for all the people who house clean with vacums everyday yes i do, after having used one yesterday for the very first time and having it accidentally attack( don't know how but it stated sucking a piece of my jeans and i was like oh my god it's alive and my mom was like basterd this can only happen you. Anyway the reason i was using a vacum for the vey first time was that my mom bribed me into helpinng her preapare/clean one of her best friends house so that when she arrived her house would be clean(isn't my mom thoughtful) and it's also due to the fact that she's the caretaker while my mom's friend is on vacation. So the vacum cleaner it's hell it's like doing aerobic exercises while pulling backa nd fourth a heavy machine. SO anyway while i was searching through some files on bloger like who like's what i like i noticed no one like's the poseidon adventure, or the movie Heather's, hasn't anyone heard of cult classics, it's probobly just me im like a film fanatic and stuff.
