And bear in mind that I have been a wrestling fan since the mid-80's...and I have seen a lot of PPV lead-in's...plus, in the last few years, I've been reading a couple wrestling websites...  I'm totally lost.  HHH is in the main event of Armageddon, in a Triple-Threat Match with Kane and Bill Goldberg, yet Trips hasn't even shown up in any way, shape, or form on Spike TV.  Not only that, but JR and the King have made no attempt to even play HHH's absence on something.  We're just supposed to accept that he's in the main event at the next PPV without having done anything, let alone tape a promo.  One would almost think that he's married into the McMahon Family or something...  On to the show: (This is purely one drunken idiot looking at the card and saying how he think it would be booked.  I accept no responsibility for any of my dozens  AND DOZENS  of readers placing bets with their bookies)   Booker T. vs Mark Henry --Say it aint so, Book!  Lemee holla atcha, playa....Last April, you were in the main event at WrestleMania.  You da man, Book!  You're my favorite guy on the RAW roster.  Why they burying you?  Especially against a punk like Mark Henry.  I wanna see yo' ass bust this one out, cuz you my man!  I got this guy in urlLink  PA named Elvin  who calls you "Loser T" that I wanna prove wrong.  See, Elvin been drinkin' too much of tha Hata-Ade.  Pull that win out...do it for this white crakka brutha!  Take a heel turn after that, it's all good...just don't let that playa-hata Elvin bad mouth you.  B'lee dat!   Trish Stratus  Lita vs. Chris Jericho  Christian  --  All this for one Canadian Dollar.  This storyline has had a decent buildup that I was enjoying until my mom came in while I was watching RAW.  She saw Trish on the TV and said, "Oh my lord, she looks just like Krishna!"  Krishna is one of my *ahem* friends down here in Atlanta, and I'll be damned if my mom wasn't right, but if Trish had a bit more junk in her trunk, she'd be a dead ringer for Krishna.  (I ought to give her a call...).  Anyway, I'm seeing a Trish heel turn.  She's sooo going to hook up with Jericho.  I feel like a teenage girl watching a soap opera (The days of our RAW?).   Randy Orton vs. Rob Van Dam  -- RVD is da man!  Most WWE fans love RVD!  I am a total mark for RVD!  RVD is going to lose the I-C title to Randy Orton, and I will be royally pissed if the time of the match is 4:20.   Batista vs. Shawn Micheals-- The behemoth from DC is destined for great things in the WWE. He needs to work on his mic skills a bit, but his wrestling ability is awesome! My gut sez Batista wins after a heroic effort by HBK.  However, upon further reflection, perhaps it will be Micheals (who beat Jericho against all odds at WM XIX) who put Devon's former Deacon in his place.  I call this one a tossup.   Tag Team Turmoil: I love this concept!  By random draw, two teams start out, when one is eliminated, another comes in and so on and so on... The Dudleys are the defending Champs going into this.  The other five teams are:Mark Jindrak  Garrison Cade, Val Venis  Lance Storm ,Hurricane  Rosey, Test  Scott Steiner, and Rene Dupree  Rob Conway.  This should be quite the spectacle to watch.  Look for Test and Big Poppa Pump to be your hook-up at the end.  And that should do it for a great PPV.  See you all next time!   ummm...Drew???   What?   You forgot about the main event.   There's a main event?  No way... Wait!  Don't tell me!  The Rock  Sock Connection vs. Shane and Vince McMahon!   Nope...   Awww crap...I actually have to write about this, don't I?     Yup     Goldberg vs Kane vs HHH for the World Title--   Ever seen two men in a ring trying to wrestle eachother but won't sell eachother's moves?  I've seen that a few trimes.  What I have yet to see is a triple threat match where all three contestants are non-sellers.  This should be, um, great?  Trips hasn't even shown up on TV for the last two weeks to lend this main event any credibility.    That alone would almost lead the purest cynic into thinking HHH is getting the gold back.   Might happen, noway to tell these days.  I say it goes one of two ways...Kane gets the strap and runs with it briefly, or Goldberg hangs on.  It all depends on how Bill's contract negotiations work out.
