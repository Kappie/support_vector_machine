It'd be a Tuesday so you wouldn't have to have homework 2 days in a row.  (sorry people who read my blog but this extra credit stuff is for extra credit, not entertainment).  The name of the Holiday is Celebrate your Date DAY!?!?!  Yeah, you'd go on a date.  That would be nice, except a whole day devoted to a date would kinda' get lame.  So you'd celebrate you date by going to skate and then open the gate to find another girl named Kate.  You're girlfriend gets mad, kate gets mad, the holiday is ruined, and this is the end of my blog. The Bongos will BonGO all night long.... Keep it real, I'm Will
