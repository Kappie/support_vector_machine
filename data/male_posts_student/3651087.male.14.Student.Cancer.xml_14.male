I wonder sometimes what is leadership?It is a person who can promote a certain actvity or a person who can make a class to follow the school rules?  But to me I have a different deifination of Leadership ,it should be something which comes from the inside and not being trained out .So a good councillor should be able to :  -Get respect from the people -Get recongition -Obey the laws and set a good example -Encourage people to follow the rules -Correct people from getting into a path which is wrong.  So all school councillors out there ,if you think that you dont have these qualities dont give up because it also takes time
