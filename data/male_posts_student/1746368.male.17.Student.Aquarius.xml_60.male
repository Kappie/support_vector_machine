Bookends:: Harry Potter (those are the type of bookends I have)  Compliment:: Nice  Gutter:: ball  Obsession:: Magnificent  Heavy:: weight  Real:: time  Disposable:: Friend (it's from Speak; the girl wanted a disposable friend)   Breeze:: Wind  Work:: out  Sweetheart:: The Moon (see if you get it)   I lied, I am online right now. Dominique left at 8 and I just got home like 15 minutes ago. I had a great time with her today. She got me a new Piers Anthony book! Yay! It's called Swell Foop.  Anyways, the link of the day is ChristianAnswers.net. It is pretty cool. It has Christian reviews of video games, movies, CDs etc. They have great answers to any question you might have.  Well, that is it for today. May your dreams be filled with many Ninja Ferrets and green kumquats.
