That site is one of those you answer questions and then it generates a profile thing. The only difference is you pick colors and it generates it. Well... I did it twice. The first time I carefully picked colors and it was semi-accurate. However, when I just blindly clicked colors really quick, the profile it generated was dead on accurate on everything. It's scary. It's especially scary at a time like this where I have a lot going on. Life really is crazy.  ***
