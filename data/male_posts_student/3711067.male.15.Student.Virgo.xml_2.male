Just toughen up you can’t live a lie. Old friends will go, and old crushes will be faded, You’re older ideas look so jaded, A kid no longer, A Person no more, You no longer control the score, Is it fate? Is it yet you? You’ve become so lost you don’t know what to do… Time increases and so does the strain, Strain increases and so does the pain,  But pain is weakness, Weakness is wrong, So correct the mistake, Become strong.
