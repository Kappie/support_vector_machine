AIN'T IT a coofoo website?             *bandwidth levels -- A bandwidth is the width of a band when each member stands side by side. There are unlimitted levels of bandwidth. Level one is 1 ft., level two is 2 ft., level three is 3 ft., etcetera, etcetera, etcetera (I have no idea why I even bothered to look up the spelling of "etc."). Hence the reason timmy wants to know why the [BAD WORD] he even mentioned bandwidth, when he should be telling us why the wesites down.
