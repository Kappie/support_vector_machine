After a while you realize that most of these people are your friend not because they particularly like you, but because you met at a few parties and exchanged phone numbers once. Then when you're out of college, whether bridges are burned or people are simply forgotten, eventually you're left with mostly one type of friend. They're the ones that even though you don't call for a month, when you DO call they're just so excited to hear from you and can't wait to get together again. Those are the great friends. They don't hold grudges, they aren't angry, they don't bring you down. When i think of the people i know, i only know of two, maybe three people like that. Thank You
