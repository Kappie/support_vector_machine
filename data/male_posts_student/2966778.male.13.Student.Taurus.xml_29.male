I saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and it was awesome!  The only thing I didn't like was that I was sitting on the left side of the third row from the front.  Of course, this was not a concert so the higher and farther you are from the front, the better it is.  I had guessed that Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban would be the best movie yet, since the third book was the best till Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix came along, which I have to say is super awesome.  I was correct.  Oh yeah, it's late so I'm gonna log out now.  More in the morning.  Later.
