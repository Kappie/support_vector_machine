Well I'm here to tell you all today that there's a new place where you can meet hoovy people like yourself and just have a good time.  It's a blog called  You're Getting Hoovier  and it's GREAT.  It worked wonders on my aunt, who after using the site for just one week quickly lost 120 lbs.  But !HEY! don't take it from me, try it for yourself FREE OF CHARGE for the next twenty-five years.  If you're not satisfied with your hooviness, try ephedra or even better try methamphetamines, they work too.  In fact, if I had to quantify the  You're Getting Hoovier  experience with some non-hoovy substance, I would use methamphetamines, perhaps even freebase cocaine...but, again, don't take it from me...visit the  You're Getting Hoovier  patented system at  urlLink hoovier.blogspot.com , and join the millions already taking part in this dangerous moral experiment.
