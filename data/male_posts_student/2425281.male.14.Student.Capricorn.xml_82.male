I have chosen to blog about auto pilot.  Auto pilot is cool because it gives the impression that i'm doing something when mentally i'm not. Here's an example, for those who don't know i play the piano, and after a while my fingers know all the notes. This allows my mind to kinda wander away for the hours that i practise while letting anyone who walks by see that i'm playing properly. Another good example is swimming. During my weekly 4km swim, my mind drifts away while my arms and legs continue to stroke. Auto pilot is also good indication whether something is boring or not. I do not enjoy swimming or playing the piano because it's boring so i have autopilot. I have not yet come across any other activities that have autopilot yet but if any of you guys have an auto pilot for something tell me. I just want to see the wide range of activities that have them
