That's a cool quote.  I'd never really thought about it that way, but it makes good sense.  I mean, I'll spend forty-five minutes plugging names into an anagram generator just to find the funniest one to use in a blog post (not that writing this thing is a vocation, but I'm trying to make a point here, so bear with me) much more eagerly than I used to have to spend forty-five minutes checking out competitor web sites when I worked in marketing for a software company before this whole law school thing.  Not that I wouldn't do it, but I would do it while rolling my eyes.  And there's not a real difference in the drudgeryness of the two tasks, I don't think.  The moral of this: if you like researching case law, come to law school.  No, that's not the moral of this.  The moral is just that it's a cool quote to think about and toss around in my head for a few minutes, before I return to whatever it is I was doing before I read Waddling Thunder's post.  I think it was laundry.
