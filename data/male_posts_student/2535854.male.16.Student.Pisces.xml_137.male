Then Cheryl came and after taking and ice age of figuring out what to order we got like that deep grilled cheese,some chicken thing which eventually was forgotten abt,a 2 person Paella,some mushroom thing in olive oil and potato wedges in aioli..I later orderd a carrot juice..  So as usual talked and what not...the mushroom thing was good...Eugene was all over the wedges and specially the aioli which i`m not a big off and I definately stayed away from that nasty deep grilled cheese thing!Those guysa re nuts if you ask em for liking such a hideous thing!I mean what is it??Anyways the paellas which take abt 30mins to prepare came and I don`t think they took 30mins though..and I kept threatening eugene and his allergy to prawns and I was the only one who can or at least seems to eat prawns though I find getting the shell of a pain in the neck and it takes forever and sometimes you never get it all off or you get very little meat..Wanted to get salad but nah didn`t..haha...the carrot juice was alright..was thinking abt an Espirit but nah just had one the day before and it costs so much that might as well just spend double or so and get a freshly done drink!Billwas like 110 bucks which isnt that bad..we split it like 30 bucks each I think..ah dunno la I oso dun care heheh..Anyway we were so intent on dessert but decided not to get it there...That what ever thats name ice cream parlour (I think) place at the corner of the street or what used to be Piccolo Mondo closed down..they kept talking abt a place and it turns out that was the place..ill get the name of that place later..heh when passing by only I rememberd the name :p  So went to Alexis for dessert and got cake...I got some chocolate truffle,Cheryl got some cheese cake which she kept thinking there was 'mold' in it but I said blue cheese.Muahaha I AM SO FUNNY!Heh.And we also flipped through em weird magazines and stuff...and heh I was paying for Cheryls tea so I kept pound the leaves and stuff with that super chun tea server thing!If you wanna know,just go to Alexis and order tea!I love tea!haha..ok then Eugene went back at like 3:30pm..hmm bill was 46 bucks which was quite a lot to me but I only had to pay like 20 bucks so I dont have any problems..so we left and went to MPH..  Woah Harith Iskandar was at Alexis just now at the time man!I dont belive Eugene didn`t know who he was or recognise him!Damn thats like the 2nd celebrity ive seen in two days!Who else am I gonna see next?I mean I am going to Klgcc on Wednesday so you never know!  So went to MPH and looked at the cd`s there...bought the new Harry Potter soundtrack cd for Cheryl and gave her,her Saturday Night Fever cd...also got a Father`s day card and double-sided tape...Then Cheryl`s sis came to pick her up so then I walked home at ot home at like 4:05pm..She owes me like a hundred bucks now but I won`t hold it against her really..But still ot like rm70...wanna save some for that thing at Klgcc and like some to pay for a fathers treat if my family goes out for dinner and my bro`s not around..  Was planning to go to 1Utama like after that but it was so hot and maybe a bit lazy so i`ll go another day..now its getting more closer to 4months that I aint shopped in like big ammount!  Oh yeah I dyed my hair brown for no reason the other day cause you know brown isnt so easy to see but I didn`t think it was noticable enough so I dyed it copper again and my hairs still quite short so cant quite see it,but its much lighter than it naturally is and its like certainly gonna show when my hair gets longer...  anyway i`m pathetic ehre,sitting in my room on my laptop on wifi blogging here at like 3am past..damn I need to sleep soon..gotta go for that Klgcc thing at like 1pm and what not so yeah that`s all for now guys!Hope you have a nice day!I certainly did! =)  P/S Jianyau rocks man!  Riz.
