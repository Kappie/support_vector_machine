They designed an automated system where cars reserve a time to pass through an intersection as they approach it and are then sped up or slowed down to ensure their arrival at exactly the right time. This allows traffic to enter the intersection from all directions simultaneously, eliminating the need for traffic lights and considerably reducing delays caused by stopping traffic.   Check out the  urlLink simulation  of an intersection of two six-lane roads.  Pretty cool stuff, but how useful is this?  The paper concludes by stating that  once autonomous vehicles are common, this mechanism may be useful for managing real traffic.    Hmm, well it doesn't take into account pedestrians or errant soccer balls, nor does it allow for turning, but I think the real problem is a simple one. People just love their cars.  There is a sense of personal empowerment when in control of a car, and I just can't see people giving that up. I am reminded of the movie Singles (which I might add features a young Pearl Jam circa 1992) . Anyhoo, one of the main characters is working for the city developing a  Super Train  to solve Seattles traffic woes. This train is luxurious, fast, safe, convient and cheap compared to a car. But, it will never succeed because people just love their cars.
