For four years at Christendom I was surrounded by serious young Catholics.  It was "normal" to see a great percentage of the students attend daily Mass.  We all agreed on the basics.  Now that I'm home, I'm able to get together with my old friends from high school.  They too are all good Catholics, but we all have different college stories to tell.  Some who went to larger Catholic universities do not share my optimism. They tell stories of low morality among the student body and Catholic professors who are far from authoritative on serious issues.  Some friends often felt isolated and their desire to participate in the social life of the university clashed with their personal disgust with the lives many of their fellow students.  While I am grateful for my experience at Christendom, sometimes I wonder if it presented me with an realistic impression regarding the state of our young university peers.    Some of my friends are now in graduate school and their observations regarding the morality of their fellow students is equally troubling.  Those in medical school tell of professors and students who disregard the transcendent dignity of the human person in favor of a cold, utilitarian vision of medicine. In our discussions, my friends and I agree that many young Catholics feel a void in their souls.  They are searching for something that would give meaning to their existence.  If they are presented with the truth in a way that personally relates to them, they will usually respond. The "If it feels good, do it" motto of our parents' generation has become old and many young people are beginning to realize this and are embracing religion in the hope of finding meaning and fulfillment. Many have accepted the challenge of Pope John Paul II to live a life of responsibility and holiness.  Our current culture preaches a radical individualism that results in a sense of self-alienation and emptiness.  There's definitely a lot of work to do, but it looks like there is a light at the end of this tunnel.  Young Catholics are embracing their faith with renewed appreciation and hope.  Maybe we could start a little discussion of our own experiences and thoughts regarding this topic.  We all come from different backgrounds, some are students, others are in the work force or military, so each insight will be extremely useful in arriving at a better understanding of the current situation.
