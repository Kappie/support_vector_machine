Is this really what I have become?  Malevolent. Malificent, yes, I rather like that one. She was always my favorite villian, Malificent. Of all the tepid Disney villians, she was truly good. Good in the sense that she was good at what she did. Pure, efficient evil. And you know how I like efficiency. If I could execute my plots with such efficiency as her, I would be set for life. Hell, if I could transform into a 30 foot tall dragon like her, I'd be set for life. Prince Charmings went out of style in the late 80s, so my unruly schemes would go undaunted! The world is mine!  The world is mine?  Does anybody really know what vaught is? How about avarice?   Alien vs. Predator is coming out soon. I've been waiting for this for 23 years. No, seriously. Do I want to see it for the high production value? Do I want to see these two magnificently horrid subcultural icons battle it out? Do I want to see the...*giggle*...Riveting plot and exceptional acting? Or do I just want to see a bunch of stupid humans get ripped to shreds? I choose d) Regis, and yes, that is my final answer. HA!  Why do I refuse to sleep? Is it because I seek to escape nightmares in all their glory? Do I love reality this much? Or am I simply a victim of the human condition? "Catch me please, for I am falling." Yes.    I no longer wish to scream atop the mountains. Why? What has changed? What has changed in me? Nothing has changed, I still have most of my organs, I am still the same cynical, cold, efficient sociopath that I always was. Something has changed? But what? The answers have to be somewhere, I suppose I will require some sort of machine to extract them. I shall call it "The Answering Machine." Patent pending. That applies to all of you.  I don't quite know why it is that I'm still here. I wonder about that sometimes. If I have failed my purpose, then shouldn't the game be over? Maybe I should ask Cain for another quest. I need a journey of sorts to figure things out. Pity I have no money and no superhuman strength to traverse me across Sanctuary. What have I left to offer!?  ANSWERS!
