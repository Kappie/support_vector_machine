Blackout '03 as the newspaper called it, was a pretty interesting time. For me at least. It meant I spent almost an entire day duelling and playing chinese checkers with my neighbours. Fun. And the stars were pretty bright too! I didn't get much sleep during those days tho.. was on the phone. Anyhow, we were pretty well-off, because we had flashlights and cold rice. The next day we brought out some stove thingy and cooked congee.   Ah... some other people were not so lucky. Most businesses loss a lot, specially those that stocked frozen foods and whatnot. My condolences go out to them... =\ ..    My neighbour managed to bbq some stuff, so that was cool. Which reminds me, the sunday which followed, i went to a bbq at parent's friend's house. That was pretty cool.. they had like 2 kids, one my age, and another 6 years younger. The one my age was at some camp thingy, but the smaller one actually duels, so I did that. Fun. (i carry around my cards almost all the time)   Anyway, back to the blackout. Interesting to see the very wide range of reactions to it. Interesting also, to note how dependant we are on electricity. Umm... somehow makes me wish that we  didn't  have those generators, nuclear or fuel-powered. Then see how we can survive. And maybe develop better sources of energy, like natural!   Investigation is still underway on the electricity problem. They kinda think that it has to do with an Ohio power plant, which caused a sink because it was overloaded by a huge current. The sink cause other surrounding plants to overload. Only those that isolated themselves from the power grid was safe. Those that didn't spread the problem. Around 50 million people were without electricity.    Now, if you haven't fell asleep yet... I have good news: my computer is now re-formatted and ready to go. It has sound, windows XP, trillian pro... the whole nine yards! Complete with bells and whistles! (not really... it's the same old computer with an upgraded OS, that's all). The only problem is getting the ancient computer running again... I seem to be having problems with it. My sister and i are going to try to fix it... hopefully sometime soon.   S'all for now   ~Chronos
