       
      My days really suck.  I can't seem to have a good one to save my life.  I really give up...I don't know what to do anymore, I always manage to ruin whatever kind of good day I already have.  I need to learn to keep my mouth shut and not say anything to anybody because I'll just end up ruining it.
