They call it the biggest party in the world,more than million people attend this once a year party on the new years eve, to see a 1060 pound crystal ball drop from a pole on one times square.I think it's not the ball,or the celebrities who press the button,or music shows,not even the confetti or pyrotechnics that makes it such a wonderful moment.The ball drop is a spectacular event because you celebrate it with thousands of people around you,whom you have never met,or will ever meet again.People surpass their differences to celebrate as one,the passage of time or time itself.Have you ever wondered,what exactly you are celebrating on the new year's eve, I think we are celebrating time,the time that we had,the time that we will have.After all passage of time is how our future attacks our present and it's only apt that the drop happpens at time square.It was my first year in the United States,and Syracuse University not being very far from the city,it was only natural,that me and my friends  decided to celebrate the 2002/03 new year at times square.  Me,PV,DV,Sanjay and Hari drove down to manhattan,parking our car somewhere in New Jersey,we caught the path to manhattan and reached there by the morning of dec 31st.We did a lot of walking around,meeting friends in the city,a bit of shopping and stuff like that.For starters the event is not exactly a walk in the park,security is immense,you see more cops than parking spaces.Traffic will be closed between Broadway and Seventh Ave as far south as 42nd St and as far north as 59th, by 6pm , or earlier, depending on crowds.So you have to come take your spot atleast by noon,thats is to get a good spot I mean.and once you are in the broadway cordon there is no going back,coz you can't come back,and the cops close down the streets by the 5 or 6PM,and guys booze isnt allowed,unless you know the cops or something.We took a spot close to the 44th street,which is not much of a spot anyway,but we were new to the city,and we were thrilled.  We stood there chatting with each other and people around us,calling home and friends and announcing that we were at times square.After two or three hours you get a little tired,and your legs begin to ache.Then it strikes you that you have atleast another six hours of standing still to do,and you desperately try to keep up your spirits,which actually is not very difficult with so many people around.After another hour I began cursing myself for having that large soda,It feels as though you are subjecting your bladder to heavy weight training.I kept myself distracted by chatting,lot of yelling,and by nightfall everyone is hysteric anyway.I waited and waited, and I literally began counting down seconds when there was still couple of hours to go.When finally the one minute count down began,I was ecstatic,not out of joy,but out of hopefulness that I would be able to do justice to my bladder.  After the confetti and pyrotechnics,and customary hugging and dancing and handhsakes,my friends and me started the mad scurry to find a restroom.Now I think most people had the same issue and most of the open shops and restuarants closed down their restrooms,we finally found a run down chinese take-out,which even that night was not crowded.I bought some old lo-mein and spring rolls and won myself a ticket to use the restroom.When I got to the restroom,one of it was occupied and there were a few people waiting outside the other one,as I stood wiggling in the line,a cop came around asked us,who was in the other restroom,no one seemed to know,as he knocked,two teenagers came scurrying out,people in the queue were filled with rage,and I am surprised that the two got out unscathed.The cop was my hero that day,and when I finally releived my bladder,I felt as though I was having the best time of my life.
