I think the front is the best spot, there's nothing blocking your view. I rode "Top Gun" twice and I rode the Borg. The Borg was the best coaster I've ever been on. On it you ride hangings upside down, like your laying on your back, looking at the ground. It was so sweet, it makes you feel like your flying.  In other news, I talked to Kym today. I actually enjoyed the conversation, she wasn't that annoying. She usually bugs me the entire time. It made me fell better about telling her I was gay. I might tell her about my blog, but I'm going to have to edit the things I've said about her. I think if I was going to tell another person (that I'm not attracted to), it would be Chris because he is not a very biased person and he knows me so well I don't think he would freak out. But I don't think I will tell him anytime soon.  I'm thinking of starting up a new website, I'm not sure what I want it to be about yet. It's either going to be anime or a yaoi site. I dunno, maybe I'll make two sites.   I have to watch my neices tonight, wish me luck! I only get paid 13 dollars though which really sucks, but its better than nothing. I think I'm going to order a Saiyuki collectors box to hold my dvds. I can't wait for the third volume to arrive next week. The first two were so good and very funny. Well its about time for me to go. TTYL
