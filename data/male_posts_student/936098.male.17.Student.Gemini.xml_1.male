Thank you, Ronnie, for two great months of funeral memories and media exaggeration of the importance of your death. We are indebted to you for giving us something to fill our newspapers with.   For our English class, we were given two assignments to be due this week: a "narration essay" and a "description essay." Except, neither are really essays, and the assignment is a lot more strict than the names suggest. The "narration" secretly has to be something that happened to us, and it has to have a conflict, so it's a combination short story/memoir.  Then the description is really a description of a person, so it's actually a profile.  And he suggested combining the two assignments, so now it's a short-story-memoir-profile-essay.  And since each one was supposed to be 1Â½ pages, and he never gave us a real length requirement for the combination, mine is barely 2 pages.  I almost turned it in today but we have to have a rough draft so I'm changing five or ten random words in the story.  Yesterday, when we walked in the door Sara's watch turned to 9:41, and the class starts at 9:40 supposedly. The instructor called us late, then insulted us a few times. So today we walked in at about 9:31, and almost everyone was already there. Then, at about 9:33 he started calling role. Sara said "so apparently he calls role before the class even starts."  We've been trying to play DDR everyday, and we've been pretty successful.  I think Era is still my favorite DDR song--there are songs with more intense or difficult steps, but I really just like the song a whole lot. We've actually played a couple that weren't Abyss or .59. Exciting.
