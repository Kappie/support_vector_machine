My uncle had a 2 week trip planned with some Bolivians he does research with, and he invited me along. It was an offer I couldn't resist. I haven't seen Sudamerica yet. So I'll be Titicaca-ing it this August. Should be a nice break before coming back for my last semester at uni in the fall. Well, at least until grad school. Gotta go get my meds now...wouldn't want malaria or typhoid. Write more later.  Tim
