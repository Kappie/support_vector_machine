Tits show out through their shirts and everyone knows how big they are. Why isn't is the same for guys? You can't really look at a guys crotch and know what he's packing. Do the women feel like they're getting ripped off? Do they see this as double standard? Why am I the only guy I know-- the only guy in my school-- who sports a cock-bulge? I'll wear pants and if you look you'll probably see my dick hanging down my right leg. Do all other guys just have midget cocks? Am I just the only guy who wears pants that fit right? Am I just stuck in the 80s? Why the fuck am I writing this? Why the fuck am I even thinking this?  I think all that daydreaming of Steve Guttenberg got me all gayed up...*sighs*         NP: When I wrote this at work: Alicia Keys new song. It's good. Very motown  NOW:   Lemon Jelly- Space Walk  Modest Mouse- Float On
