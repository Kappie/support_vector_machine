So I'm driving faster Nothing seems as important as before Not looking to see who's running after Yeah, I'm still craving an eastern shore  So who are you going to be, My faint and faltering friend? Just one more headstone along the way Another casualty of my hesitations  We've made a rope to hang From the ties that bind Rafters of our love Still, I hope that you will find:  All that you desire and a little bit more A thousand lonely beaches and a silent shore Twenty million smiles and love worth dying for But me, I'm still craving an eastern shore  Does it really matter who Wakes up with their head on your shoulder At least you've got someone to play with your hair It's better than being alone.  I'll send you a postcard or write you a letter Just to let you know that I am alive But I'll be dead, I'll be dead, with you in my head It's better than being alone.
