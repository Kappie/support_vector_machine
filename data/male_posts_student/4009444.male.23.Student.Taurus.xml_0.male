This is Swany, me and Horv are coming back from the bar and from eating ... food, because we're both fat.  We beat these old people at darts today, we kicked their ass like...  we played seven games and we beat them like five games to one, because... we're young, studly, and better than them... at darts... and you are in...  Mount  Prospeeeect!   You should... This is your last chance at Iowa State tomorrow, we're leaving at like 6... Of course that's 6 pm, you should come.  Did I say pm or BM? Cause I have to make a BM. And... Fish having sex is cool, so your research paper is cool.  And I have to fart, listen to that (farts into phone). My farts rule."  Keep in mind he is huffing and puffing through the entire thing, which makes it so much more funny.  In case you can't tell, I'm tired of doing the love/hate lists already, so don't expect them.
