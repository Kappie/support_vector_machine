Y'ALL ARE PUSSIES WHOEVER WAS RUNNIN!!!  Ozzfest is coming up people, and guess what, if you take your purple asses down to the tweeter center, lawn seats are still availible FOR TEN BUCKS A POP!!! you're pretty fuckin stupid like me if you don't go down there and get yourself a ticket!   but yea, my relationship with courtney is starting to slip, atleast i'm starting to feel that way... and i don't want to. We haven't been talking much, and I really want her to talk to me about things but she won't. and she says nothings wrong. and then sometimes i feel like shes lying to me, but i don't know what, especially shit with jeremy. i've basically given up this cheap shit w/ him... for her, and if she doesn't start doing shit for this relationship, i'm out of it, cuz i can not stand it. and i think she knows that by now. i love her, shes my fiance, but idk, sometimes i gotta do wrong, in order to find the right. shes seems like everything to me, but its shit in our relationship that she keeps from me. I KNOW for a fact theres shit that she won't tell me or she'll tell other people, but not me, and i fuckin hate it, and i'm not gonna deal with it much longer. and some shit she misses like fuckin flirting and all that shit, she could have back, if i break up with her, and she won' have to worry about me being up her ass about jeremy or anybody or anything. and this relationship i want to keep, but its hard to keep it when theres nothing in it for me. and i really want her to start talking to me a lot more, and doing shit with me a lot more, and doing shit for me a lot more. and if you're one of my friends in taunton, then you'll know how much i love courtney, and how much hit i do for her, yet i sit here and discuss my problems. i can't do this with her, cuz then we'll fight, or she'll act a certain way that i don't like, or she'll start doing shit, just because someone else wants her to, and she never understands where i come from. and if you know her, please talk to her a little bit. i love her a lot, but idk at this point. i love you so much courtney and i don't want to loose you.   caitlyn  eric: to of the best friends i have and thank you for being there when i've needed you the most. and i really enjoy helping the both of you out too. you guys are awesome!!!  alyse leonard: you're awesome! a really kool friend to me and i have fun when we hang out. we should hang out more often. and don't worry about bobby, i'll take care of him for you. no problem. *have fun at camp*  john lopes: dude!!! you're a really good fuckin friend and you're ALWAYS there when i need you, especially dealing with courtney's pms bullshit. and especially that night when we both died, and it was a tragic night.  roman fillion: CASHEW!! you're ass better get back from florida and get to the galleria mall, or i'm gonna go psycho, and when you're at fuckin floida... it isn't as boring as massachusetts. theres beaches with REALLY NICE CHICKS!!! or go to fuckin disney world, or a fuckin baseball game, or sea world, or cape canavral, or something, but it's a lot better than massachusetts!!!  courtney demoranville: my baby! i love you so much and i love it when you're there for me, and i'd be dead right now if it wasn't for you, cuz i'd have to go to either a foster home, a group home, or jail, and i'll die if i go back to any of those places. and you kept me from there and you've helped me out and supported my ass with the bullshit with my mom. i love you cupcake! XoxO  ashley jenkins: ashley, i can't even begin to say anything. thank you for believing in me and making me stop drinking, i don't know where i would be if i continued. and i did it all for you. you and your damn emo mucis shit, you've got me listening to it constantly now and sometimes i fuckin hate it. but then again... i love it. ~AND YOU'RE STILL A REDNECK!  brooke leonard: you're an awesome friend to have around and you're a person i can talk to sometimes, and i really enjoy that. you better kick ass in softball!!!  um... it's 2:22 a.m. right now, so if i forgot you, well, it's 2:22 in the fucking morning, so don' pull a hernia on me ok!! kool beans! i'll talk to you all later!!
