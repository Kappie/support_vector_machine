Wahh....yi ge liang ge. Shan shan lai chi. Make me wait there for so long. I was so worried that we would be late. Kelvin met me and we took bus 98 down there.   JiaHao arrived shortly, followed by Gek. Phew! We didn't turn out late after all!   What nice interview session! Me and GekLing were doing interviews duties for this round. The moment was quite tense in the beginning, but it all melted away. Mr Ong invited his HOD of Maths, Mrs Toh to share in the interview.   It wasa very great session. Lots of new issues were brought up, and we were made aware of the different sides of the issues we are working on. It's a mind-broadening event. :D They also decided to help us distribute our surveys to their classes! So kind of them! We took a group photo. I truly must say, we enjoyed working with them! :D  After that we went to Boon Lay Primary and seeked an audience with the vice-principal. We booked an interview date with her on Friday, and she also helped us take some surveys to her classes. How nice!  After that, we went to Lakeside Primary. The very nice vice-p, Mrs Fong let us do an interview. This time, Kelvin Lim and JiaHao did the interview. Rotation of shifts ma. Heh.   After that we went to the canteen to let the kids do some surveys. We would like some surveys experience ma, not just schools help us do. These kids readily want to help leh! It's such a surprise! All those adults would be like very unwilling and stuff, but kids actually volunteered to be surveyed! How amazing! Such is the preciousness of the children. :D  Right. After that we went to Clementi for lunch. I ate laksa. Yes. Even ducks meow and moo!  Okay. We went to NanHua, but we can't get through. Sigh. I think we are all giving up on that school. Quite snobbish. We decided to go home lor.  Me and Kelvin took 963 bus back to Woodlands Interchange. Heh. We fell asleep on the long bus journey. So tired!   I went back, surfed the net and stuff la. Cheh. Nothing to do. Okay. I go off le la. 30 more minutes to 7th July! Weee! See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
