From my simple and small list of experiences, I've found the world view supported by Christianity to be closest to "truth". Not only from parental inheritance, but personal revelation and study have shown this to be quit true. You see, that's the rub. I may believe in an absolute truth, but I cannot claim to  know  this truth. I can only promise the claim of a scientist: that this is as real as you can expect or, in all honesty, claim. Still, that's a good start and there is plenty of time to fill in gaps. Why do I believe in such an absolute truth? Because if it does not exist, then nothing can truthfully exist. No morals or logic will remain except the arbitrary choices of us madmen. There can be no better or worse because all are neutral and unequivical. The search for truth becomes a dog chase, not only after an unreachable mechanical rabbit, but a rabbit that isn't even there. I'd do a "better" job of finding truth by writing down beliefs and randomly pulling them out of a hat. No, this is not for me. My bones and intuition tell me there is sometime more beautiful, more purposeful "out there". That is why I do not enjoy groin dancing, why I read my Bible everyday, and placidly walk through life. I'm looking, searching, and occasionally finding. That is the de-rub.
