Some of you might remember it - it was called  Friday the 13th: The Series,  or, back in Malaysia, was known as  The Curse  (originality and creativity in titles are seriously overrated). The show revolved around a young woman, Micki, and her cousin Ryan, who inherit an antique store from their late uncle Lewis. Micki and Ryan decide to sell all the items in it -- and  then  they discover that their dead uncle had made a deal with the devil (uh-huh), causing every item in the shop to be cursed. Now they have to run around looking for each item, with every episode involving a different cursed object. The freaky thing is that the owners of these antiques are able to use them for dark, evil purposes, usually for personal gain.  In episode one, our intrepid heroes go after a little girl with a cursed doll with a malevolent personality. In other episode, a plain-faced lady uses a mirror to "blind" men into falling in love with her. The downside? She has to kill them after she has had her way with them, in the most gruesome ways imaginable. In yet another episode, the owner of a cursed glove discovers it has the ability to heal, giving him popularity in the form of a faith healer by laying his gloved hand on someone. The bad side is that he has to "transfer" the diseases on to someone else by touching them -- and these diseases will be ten times worse than when they started. Many episodes involving a range of different objects led to a series that was creative, original, and downright scary for its time. It was one of those ideas that allowed for a seemingly  endless  array of plots -- after all, anything from a pen to a computer mouse (which wasn't all that popular then, haha!) could be used for dark and dastardly purposes.  Some of the episodes that I still remember fondly are such as the Scarecrow, which would come alive to kill victims targeted by its owner; the Mulcher, a gardening machine that would deposit money if a dead body were put into it; the Tattoo Needles, which could make its tattoos come to life (a horrible scorpion scene, I can recall); the Boxing Gloves, with which a fighter is guaranteed to win because while he is pummelling his opponent, his  shadow  (a play on shadow-boxing) is out beating innocent people to death; the Dentist's Chair, which gave its owner the power of electrokinesis; the Magic Boxes, which allowed a magician's assistant in one box to survive the most deadly of stunts involving spikes, glass, etc, while an innocent in another box endures the suffering; and the Camera, which allowed its owner to make a duplicate of   himself, providing an alibi while he went about killing people.  Sadly, though, the series was only shown up til around the end of Season One in Malaysia, and ended after Season Three elsewhere due to it being too dark (plots dealing with the occult are always a risky venture). Still, the episodes that I remember viewing were very entertaining, occasionally gory, and sometimes downright freaky. Here are some pictures that I stole from another website. Heh.    Scary little girl with scarier playmate.     The scarecrow walks at night...     The 'black widow' uses the mirror to blind potential lovers.   If I'm not mistaken, several episodes are available on video in Malaysia -- so if you've got nothing better do to, why not check it out? The quality of the filming and writing might be a little dated now, but I'm sure it would still add some chills and thrills to your Friday the 13th. Have a good one, boys and girls!
