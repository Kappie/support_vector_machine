Ohh today was also an easy day and i got out early, tomorrow we have our retreat, so no classes and then thurs im gettin out early also.  its great, espically the timing since im getting sick of school during the 4th quarter.  We had prayer group tonight, it was good.  i realized i kinda got further from god the past few weeks i dunno i guess ive just been cluttered with other junk so im gonna try and get that back on track in the near future b/c everything is easier then.  humm anything else .... ohh trip gave me my CHRISTMAS present tonight at prayer group, he said he has had it sitting at his house forever.  its a really cool nike visor and ppl actually told me i looked good in it so i may wear it! (hats in the past just havent been my thing).  well i think thats about it ohh i went to walmart also on my way home to get the new mercy me cd and some swiss cheese hahaha what a combo but they only had the swiss cheese to i got it and headed home to make my lunch for the retreat tom (what a massive sandwitch i packed).  i hope bryndan get back soon its just not the same without him here i also have his assignments to give him (what fun :P) ok well im headed off to bed i will catch yall prob tom or some day close to it.
