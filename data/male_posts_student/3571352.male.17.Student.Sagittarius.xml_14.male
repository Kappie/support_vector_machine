My dad approves of the 7.1 Home Theater setup and I will be installing it this summer. :-D  We are un-decided on what type of speakers we will be getting but I will keep you posted.  Today I unlocked an AT Wireless GSM phone.  Now it works on ANY GSM provider that uses 800/1900 Mhz GSM signal.  It is a Nokia 3590, but hey, I got it for free and now it can be used. :-)  I can show you how I achieved this but I'm not sure if you guys can handle it. ;-)  If I see enough feedback on this subject I will post it.
