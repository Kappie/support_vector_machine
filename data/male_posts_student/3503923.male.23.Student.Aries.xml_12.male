The short-cut route takes you into a park, a brown path snakes diagonally across the expanse of grass standing out from the green, there is a play-pen where kids are swinging. In the middle, there stands a solitary goal, posts and bar.  A tanned English boy, bare chested and thin, approaches me with a ball at his feet to ask whether I'd like to join in. I hesitate a while, thinking I'm too busy. I'm about to carry on through, only to be apprehended by the whisper of a gloat. 'We're winning 8-2.' I have to step in and join the losers.  My team mates are on holiday from Spain, a boy of about 4, a boy of about 6, not a word of English between them. Their dad is the big guy, reading a newspaper, lounging on the mattress next to the picnic hamper. Mum is with the others, amusing them with the swings.  I try to orchestrate proceedings to haul us back into the game. I feed them the ball in good positions, wishing for them to score, and when they do, they make sure dad has taken note. Their red ball says Espana on it, it's a little flat, probably a precaution for their delicate feet.  After conceding another goal, we re-group at the solitary goal to talk tactics. I say 'benga', and the boys smile, I say 'ole', and the boys smile. We kick-off, generally aiming for the direction in between the bike and the jumper. We notch one, it goes in off the handle-bar.  Before the inevitable come back is accomplished, the other goal vanishes. The tanned boy hops on one post, and his accomplice wearing the other gets a ride on his saddle. The game finishes before it has even started. We all feel glad though, knowing that we were onto something good.  I pick up my shopping and start for home again. I congratulate the boys on their performance. One of the boys runs up to me with a can of diet-coke, offering it as a thank you. I look at my watch, realize it's not 11.30 and wave the Spanish family goodbye.
