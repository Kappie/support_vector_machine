It's like theyre fucking bragging or something like OMG its so cool to have A.D.D or the other one. Like it's some sort of rebel thing or something. People dont understand that so much of that shit is overdiagnosed these days. There's this one really stupid girl in 2 of my classes and she like brags about how bad her life is, she wants the attention so fuckign bad. I would be mean to her but Nick does it for all of us. It's just so annoying how fucking dumb and shit she is and shes like I have ADHD look here's my medicine, or I go to therapy!, or I smoke now, then its I quit smoking. WELL FUCK YOU I DONT CARE!  Then there's abuncha stupid fucks who run around saying oh I think I'm bipolar or he or she is bipolar. Well bipolarism is even more overdiagnosed by doctors than anything. FOr some reason everyone thinks that mood swings are bipolar and all this shit and they run around saying al this shit. I HATE IT SO MUCH, when people act like or think they know something and then they go tooting it off everywhere well fuck them those stupid uneducated, untalented, conformist, rich, preppy, unindivdual assfucks.
