I went down town earlier this evening, to watch the Idol finale, and on the way home I couldnt drive faster than 40 (kilometers/hour), wich is crazy. About the Idol thing, Kalli Bjarni won which almost translates to some cartoon Charlie something, I didnt realy like this competition because I didnt realy see what was so adorable about the contestants.  Recently I have heard a lot of great music, its been so great to hear good rock after all the college rock groups and the Korn stuff. My favorite has to be Hot Hot Heat which a rather funny kind of rock because they are so melodic, number two is  urlLink Minus  with their newest product Halldor Laxnes (named after our only nobel price winner).  The singer in that group is the son of Icelands all time most popular  urlLink poppstar  and brother of the very beautiful  urlLink Svala . The third one are british called The Darkness and are a glamrock band realy funy and energetic if you can find their video on kazaa then you should, it so funny.   Also another band I kinda like is More-Sheep-ahhhhh and as the name suggests they are British. Adam suggested them to me and they are pretty fine, very calme and generally good.  Hope my house will stay up tonight, Ãšlli
