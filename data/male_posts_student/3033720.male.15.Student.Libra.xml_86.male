Well, with the class of '04 gone, I decided I wanted to do something similar anyways. So, The International Funk Conspiracy Part Two will hopefully come to be. Right now, I want to use Daniel, Tory, and Anne, but I'm not sure. There is a ton of work I gotta do if I want it to work.   urlLink  This   is the  very  basic and rough idea of what I want to do. Listen to the whole thing, the best part is towards the end. There are lyrics to, but I think I'm gonna make it more jazzy, change the instrumentation, and ignore the lyrics altogether. Let me know your thoughts. I'm out.
