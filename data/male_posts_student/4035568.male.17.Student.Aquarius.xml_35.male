I think the reason why we are starting to get annoyed by one another is because we have been with eachother for so long and now we are so close to getting out that we just want to get away from it all. We have pretty much had enuf of eachother. 7 years of one person can get tireing, but this year is also about finding out who your real friends have been all along. You know the ones that are still friends with you right now. During this final summer, I have lost my best friend of 3 years, and my boyfriend, but the boyfriendI broke up with. And I am not dating ever again! I hate guys! I don't think this is the end of losing some more friends, but I don't think I'm not going to stop making new ones either.This part of your life I believe is a real eye opener. You get big realizations with friendships, what you want to do with your sad life, where you stand, and basically who you are. I am becoming more aware of my abilities and my personality. I pretty much know what I want in life now. Unlike about 3 years ago I was still saying I wanted to be an actress...silly, or a vet, when I can't stand the sight of blood or gory things, and then there was this part of me that wanted to be a meteorologist, when I hate science and math. It's been crazy when I look back on it. This once again hasn't been a funny story but oh well I really don't care. It will all come soon just whenever school starts, right now I'm just rambling on about nothings. Ok signing off!
