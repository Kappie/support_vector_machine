I had to share a room with Shenni until my room was constructed. after dad finished building my room and mom and i finished painting, it was an instant rule that i could put very little on any of the walls, since there are murals detailed into the wood. how do i display two-dimentional objects in a way that i can daily embrace the moments they hold?  so i began to hide them. in the pages of books, between cds, behind folders, wherever there's room, i've stuffed. it's astoundingly successful. just today i opened my favorite book,  Go Ask Alice , and unexpectedly found a photograph i took and developed last year in photography class. it's a black and white picture of a chrome clock with all the numbers backwards and faded (some call it beauty. some call it trash. i call it aiming the camera at a clock, developing the picture backwards, and not leaving the enlarger on long nough to expose the photo paper. either way, it's a really, really creepy photo). i was overwhelmed with images of Mr. Croop, Layla, Mr. Ellis, film-loading races, and dark room scents.  maybe not experiencing a collective of memories every day, but only stumbling upon them every so often is the bext way to keep my little life collection.
