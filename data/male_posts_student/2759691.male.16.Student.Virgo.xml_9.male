A record seven countries are set to audition for the spot on FOX's new  American Enemy . The auditions will be held before Prime Minister Blair, President Bush, and an unidentified senior CIA official. "We're looking for a member that displays all the qualities of being evil," said a spokesman for the show, "and we hope we find the right candidate." Representatives from Iran and North Korea, both of which are part of the "axis of evil," have so far refused to comment. The White House says it will release more information next month.  Meanwhile, a recently released Pentagon memo hints at future members of the organization. The memo's credibility has been questioned by some, especially after rumors that it listed Sweden and the Republic of Chad as possible candidates. The White House has not officially released any candidates as yet.
