For starters, how about Johnny Depp in the previews? HE LOOKS LIKE A TRANSVESTITE! Cut back on the eye shadow and we might talk, Johnny. Another thing: What is the deal with pirates? How come they have to be all "arrr im a swashbuckling pirate yarrrr"?! I mean, seriously, folks. Anyway, I give Pirates of the Carribbean -5 stars out of 5 stars, and strongly recommend that nobody sees, talks about, or even thinks about this god-awful movie on penalty of torturous death by eye-gouging.  YARR, SHE BLOWS!   Pirates of the Carribbean -  (negative five out of five stars)   End Transmission.
