All the family is from there, there are the exeptions, like me , my bro etc, watever,,, he's going there, well, he called me to go with him, do i really have to post what my aswer was?!!!!!!!!!! I travelled with him once, only us, but, imagin now, me and him, inside of a car, for 6 hours... it would be damn boring! My dad is nice, and quietly young for hsi age, but no ... no way.  He gave me some bucks, and i didn't even asked him, what a miracle! Aaaaaaw guys, the world is spinning, and changin'.
