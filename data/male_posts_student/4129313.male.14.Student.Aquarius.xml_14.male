It was hot, and not much happened, but I'll tell ya what I remember happening.  Second period I had a assembly thing, I tryed to read the whole time but they were just talking to much and to load so I couldn't remember if I was reading or listening, so I put my book away. They weren't talking about much either, at least nothing I haven't already heard. I also got the full scoop on that afterschool design class, It was one of them ROP classes so by law they wouldn't let freshmen in. It was still quite rude of him to give me the boot with out answering any questions.  Third period I found out I have a math test tomorrow, but it being reviews and stuff I learned in 5th grade math (I was quite advanced for my age, not to sound to boastful) so I'm sure to ace it.  Fourth period I have to memorize the second stanza of the poem I posted earlyer. I can't even remember the first. I'm gonna have to repeat it to myself again. It's not gonna be easy when I have to recite the WHOLE poem from memory.  Fifth period was hot again, so we all went into the gym to play some basketball. I actualy tryed to participate this time. I think I finaly memorized my locker combo too. I think.  Sixth period I found out we have a test tomorrow. (hence the "german test friday" in the title) I'm getting fairly good, german is a simple, and cool language to learn. I'm gonna ace this test too.  After school my front tire was flat again, It's annoying because I have to walk it in the opposite direction of where I'm supposed to be heading just to pump it back up at the 7/11, and then I have to ride all the way back to the school and go on from there. I realy hate these thorns that lie around just WAITING for a bike to run it over so that it can put a tiny hole in it and slowly deflate it. Even the slime wont protect you, you have to get those realy expensive heavy duty tires made of solid ruber, and I only have it on the back tire.  I got home and had a bunch of sweat stains on my shoulders from my book bag straps.  Again, if you would like to send me money to pay for a new notebook computer, please contact me. I would realy like to do stuff while moving lol.  Also I would like to ask, is there a way I can make my desktop picture in the sidebar auto update itself? Please contact me or coment on this post if you could help.
