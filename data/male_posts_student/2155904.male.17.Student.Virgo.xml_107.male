Tyke hopes to get up before 10.  But that might be a stretch.  Hopefully by 10 then.  Today he was awakened again by the call of Macaroon McGee and once again Macaroon was surprised by the fact that Tyke wasn't up yet.  Does it ever not surprise him??????  Well, Tyke quickly showered and got online and they planned out their doings for the day.  At 1:30 Tyke, Macaroon, and Maniak all met up at Costco and got a pizza to take back to Tyke's pad.  It was a very good pizza indeed.  Mmmm.  They ate it and listened to some music while talking about the daily gossip.  Ya know, guy stuff.  Then, since Maniak hadn't seen any of the videos they showed those and the splendor of those.  Then Maniak left but Tyke and Macaroon watched the most recent Talk Sex episode they made.  It was really quite good.  Perhaps the best yet.  But the first time Tyke watched Talking Sex he was cracking up.  The novelty of the idea is gone.  The questions are hard to come up with and the answers are just at par.  But nonetheless the most recent video was exquisite.  Randomness was the theme in this one.  It was quite funny.  Of course the usual Macaroon bashing is in there though.  Ha!  Good times.  Then they played some video games for a while and then Kinker came over.  They played more video games and hung out and then Skippy and Samantha came over.  They decided to play cards and they played quite a few different games.  From 5-Card Draw to Spit! to War to Ratscrew to Shithead.  Everything.  It was fun.  Until it was just cheating and that isn't fun.  Cheating isn't fun for Tyke anymore.  Unless it means it wins him money.  But then it is wrong so he doesn't do that.  So really cheating isn't fun.  Keep it PG.  Well, Tyke won a final game of Hold'Em and that meant he got to kick everyone out so he could have dinner.  Then he just sat around and watched TV for a while and just hung out.  He watched some of Real World/Road Rules Challenge:The Inferno.  Man, Kendal is soo hot.  Tyke still vividly remembers the time he and Skippy saw her at a Mariners game.  So hot.  So very hot.  Mmmmm...Tyke wants to meet her.  Not really but if he could he would.  Yeah, then he played some Empire Poker and talked with Macaroon on the phone about tomorrow and stuff like that.  And how he might get a new game and how Tyke wants to get ESPN NBA Basketball cuz that is sick.  Maybe he will tomorrow.  But he hates spending money.  He should sell some of the stuff he never uses.  Anybody wanna buy some games or something from Tyke???  If you see something you like make an offer.  He's going out of business.  It's a liquidation extravaganza!!!  EDIT: Bambi is one of the toughest mofos ever.  Here's why: he has his mother get shot and has to go grow up with some old guy who he doesn't really know and probably questions if it is his father or not but he never knows.  Then he comes back and sees his old pals Thumper and Flower (who is almost definitely gay by the way).  But the two pals become twitterpated with new chicks and find themselves to be more inclined to hang out with them than Bambi (been there seen that).  Well then he has to fight this guy who he doesn't know over his woman Faline cuz the guy was most likely going to rape her.  So he gets taken in the first couple rounds but then comes back strong and takes it to him knocking him out in the last round.  But that's not all.  Later on he is taking a nice snooze and finds out there is a massive fire taking down the forest.  So he rushes to find Faline but can't and she is off alone somewhere.  He finally finds her in the midst of a total handicap match with like 20 rabid dogs.  He single-handedly takes them all out and this is without fully grown antlers too.  He only has some temps in before the real things come in full.  But then as he tries to get away some fucker shoots him but doesn't come finish the job.  So he is left to sit in miserable agony while he ponders whether he will ever see his girl again or if he will even survive the night.  Well then his dad/unknown guy comes in and tells him he has to leave.  But he was just shot!!!  Somehow he manages to get up and run from this devastating fire that seems to have a mind of its own.  It is just following these two deer as they try to flee, not a very nice fire.  But then he manages to flee and get back to his woman.  Then he knocks her up and they mistakably have twins so he decides to flee and becomes the Prince of the Forest so he doesn't have to worry about those little twirps.  Definitely the decision everyone would make if faced with it.  So there, that is why Bambi is a P-I-M-P.  Oh yeah, Tyke watched Bambi tonight...
