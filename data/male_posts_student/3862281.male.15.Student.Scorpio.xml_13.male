I'm starting of with 2 'friends' just because I want to.   Sean Jackson - The reason Alyssa died. I'm not really willing to say any more about this one but regardless he is the 'friend' I hate the most.  Bradley Moogan - He attempted or atleast threatened to commit suicide once. I hate anyone who's suicidal particulary because it shows their stupidity and the fact that they have a religious belief of some sort. 1) Because who the fuck says the next life is any better? Oh, ofcourse, the fucking religious do. 2) HE WAS FUCKING GOING TO JUMP OUT OF A WINDOW, THE DUMB SHIT! That has to be the stupidest way to commit suicide. What if he landed on his feet (judging by the window he probably would have)? I'll tell you what would have happened if he did land on his feet shall I? Upon impact his leg bones would undoubtedly break and his upper leg would face a direct impact on the ground which would then force his upper leg bones up through his hip bone and into his stomach area, causing intense pain, internal bleeding, damage to organs and a hell of a lot more. And the only quick death resulting from this would be if the lungs, heart or brain are damaged so therefore the fucking idiot would suffer unbearable pain and agony until he died from blood loss or somebody injected him with one hell of an anesthetic.
