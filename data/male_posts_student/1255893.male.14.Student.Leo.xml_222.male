And you know it had to be a special day because the sun was shining while the moon was in plain sight. I'm done w/ my homework, Tomorrow's the China unit luncheon (not to mention the ROTC awards ceremony.) Summer's gonna be here in just a few days. I have no plans whatsoever, no stress, just time. Time to sit back, relax,  find out what a pretty place the word can be.   There's a few things I'd like to do this summer. I'll definetly be going out to see people. I'll try to do more individual stuff. Maybe I'll even grow a spine and ask gurls out. Lets just keep those group things to a minimum.   I'll burn new CD's. I'll go take walks more often. I might go as far as to lose my baby fat and work out. I'll unplug the TV every once in a while. I hear after a few days, you hardly miss it anyway.   Gonna hang w/ tons of ppl. Let's make a list:  Johnny, Roy, Haress, Coco, Chris, David, Jose, Ave, Cathy, Jessica, Eryn, Aaron, Stanley, and a lot more. *note, some of these people still don't know they're gonna hang out w/ me yet =D.   Blub, Ima go now. Hope tomorrow's even better than today was.
