It was pretty deep, and i guess being 10, i didn't understand it.       I always liked escaflowne, mainly because of the cool mechs.  They weren't like gundams, with computers that controled all the movements.  They were more midevil than that, with the pilot and the "Gymeloph" becoming one.  As the pilot moved, so did the gymeloph.  Another good point about Escaflowne were the  weapons that the gymelophs were equipt with.  All the zaibach (the bad guys) gymelophs had liquid steel in the arms, that could harden to become a sword, or become a projectile, that was shot at enemies.  The Escaflowne, the main gymeloph, had a small sword that would pull out of it's back, that would become larger using the same liquid steel technology.  All cool stuff.      Well, after a while, the series was canceled and hasn't been on T.V. again to my knowlege.  I am fortunate to have it all on cd, which i can watch any time i want.  But i must say, the movie was so much better than the series.  The series focus's a lot of Hitomi's power with tarot cards, something that i consider evil.  That was one of the things that kind of turned me off of Escaflowne.  Althought it had everything else going for it, it did have that one undesirable element.      Well, i must say, i was impressed with the movie.  It tells a different story that the movie, with the same basic elements:  Hitomi is teleported from Earth to Gaea.  Van pilots the Escaflowne, and is king of a people who were wiped out by bad guys.  Van's brother Falcon is the bad guy.  Dilandau is still insane.  But there were many differences too.  There was no big bad guy over Falcon.  Gymelophs were hardly used.  Hitomi didn't have tarot cards, or any power of that kind.  Van killed a lot of people, and actually was cool.  The Excaflowne was an evil "Dragon Armour".  Hitomi was refered to as "The Wing goddess", one who could summon Escaflowne.  The bad guys were called the "Black Dragon Clan".  Yes, a lot of differences, too many to mention.      Well now, you know a bit about the history that i have with Escaflowne, and you know a bit about the series itself.  On to my rant about the actual movie.      Ok, first of all, i review the animation.  Very high production quality as well.  Animation was fluid, style was used.  Detail very important.  The archatecture of the buildings in the movie was incredible.  A lot of work went into it, making it look realistic and believeable.  The characters themselves were very well animated.  One complaint, a lot of things were very dark, and you couldn't see them very well.  Next is the voices.  They used the same voice actors as they did in the T.V. series, so i recognised everyone, except hitomi.  They used an actor with much more class for her.  Very, very well done.  And lastly, the music.  Some of the most ambiotic, emotional music ever.  Very suiting for the movie.  Not only was in suiting, but it was beautiful.  I loved all of it.  The final rating for this movie: 9.5/10.  I really liked it.  They got rid of all the stuff that i didn't like in the series, and put lots of good tidbits that i did like into it.      I want to use this space to correct my rating for Aa! Megami Sama, it should have been a 9/10.      Yes, i did really enjoy this movie, and i can say i will be watching it again.  Well, i have one more to watch, and that comes tomorrow.  This one i have heard a lot about, and am hoping that it will meet my expectations.  It is Akira!  I'll tell you more about it tomorrow!
