Here will be all my links to various funny/stupid/cool websites I recommend for your viewing pleasure. You the reader can also post a cool link. But please. No obscene sites or bad links. That means you Eidleman. And if I get one Sixers link I will kill whoever posts it. *cough Ashley cough* I'm gonna keep this short since I will be adding more things to this webpage because I have nothing better to do. End post.  Listen to H.I.M.
