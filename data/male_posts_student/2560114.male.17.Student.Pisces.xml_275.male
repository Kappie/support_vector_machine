I jus got there and 15 minutes later i was done...quick and easy. Tomorrow though, im back to my daily dose of vball...starting with probly a day at the beach for a while, then im goin over to the gym at 12:30 or so to do part 2 of my recruitment tape. I still need to show more of my hitting skills and maybe do some passing aswell...payce.
