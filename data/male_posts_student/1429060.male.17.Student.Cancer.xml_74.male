I shall post here, and if Alanna requests a post of mine, I shall comply.  Okay, where were we... Ah yes. Halloween. I was a beatnik, wearing entirely black, including this kick-ass beret I bought cheap at a hat store over on Highland. And I was carrying bongos. And my father instructed me in saying "Life is shit" in french (what was it..."la vi est merde?" or something like that). I dropped by the UU church to help clean up after their Halloween party, then I drove out to Germantown (getting lost twice) for the party over at the acting god Eric's house. Seriously, an acting god. And a very pleasant chap to boot. But I hung on the outside of all the socializing and the dancing, and spoke to Heather about everything (I very much appreciate it, Miss).  Afterwards, I spoke to Elise of my anti-social tendencies. Which, on Wendesday, I also spoke of to my psychologist. And all have agreed that I should ask Mademoiselle Elise for personal "dancing lessons", the sort of dancing that follows a route of spontenaity and involves a level of self-assurement that I utterly lack. So I should hopefully be dancing soon.  Let's see...English turned out okay, despite the  evil-infused bloody  note cards that I referred to last post. However, the initially smited idea of a library party turned out well. Though the doomed study group began with only two lovely ladies (Laylee and Alanna) and I, it swelled to an eventual 7 (entirely), including Miss Katherine Warren (temporarily), Miss Jenny (who is entirely too lovely), Lise (refer to the early posts - an angel), and eventually Master Kevin (a nice fellow). 4 of us ran over to CK's after the library closed, and worked frantically over grilled cheese sandwiches. Pleasant, I daresay.  I might be in a movie! Happiness (quantity cubed). However, I dare not reveal any details...yet.  I have written a poem that I should like to post. However, I know not if it is utterly crap. Here it goes:   Kissing the Cut  She blows a kiss to him, through a cyber code Though the binary illuminates no emotion His eyes are almost seeing the little graphic A small icon, in the shape of lips Red, as it floats onto the computer screen Animated, perhaps He doesn’t want this superficial image His hand rises, to reach through the processor To catch the real thing As maybe it will slip through the speakers Molding itself to the ridges of his fingertips He can return it to his mouth Draw a new kiss from the tongue Reach Grasp again through the reflecting pool Maybe, then, a wormhole A tunnel through time and space Fourth and third dimension knit together To touch her lips with the new sigh Held on the fingerprint Because he knows that she can understand it He knows that she understands his yearnings And his own boundaries He’s trying to rise from the swamp that became home That’s why he needs a therapist That’s why when he walks through the halls Sometimes, under the artificial Manmade, synthetic, false lights His mind suddenly stumbles Into the other side of him, off the indifference plane Where he doesn’t give a damn, to where he gives too much And it gets to him That’s the time when the call from the kitchen It’s weak right now – don’t let it become stronger Never let it become stronger Like that night, when he leaned up against The cold, smooth counter And slid a knife from the wall Touched it to his flesh, but wouldn’t pull it across Couldn’t pull it across He has a speed dial number if he ever did Someone he could talk to Someone to whom he wouldn’t be afraid to Finally cry And let loose the torrent of exasperation Torn from his throat in a passion Among these words would be “I love you” And then a few minutes before “I’m sorry For everything I’ve ever done to you and to her And to him and to them and to everyone who I might Have once, just once, done something to that might have Caused me to fall into a pit – if I am not already in one And to make my fear finally become reality –  To lose you” Because she hasn’t been in his dreams Though he promised to meet her there, every night On the same elusive plain, torn atwixt shifting universes There he can kiss her As he has done, twice before Only for the duration of the dream And only for the duration of his flamenco dance With a growing fear.    Bah. I spit upon this poem. Have a lovely evening chaps. Hasta.
