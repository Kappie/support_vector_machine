I've a headache. I don't see the link to my blog on here. I'm sad. I got in a fight with my boyfriend Friday for ten minutes then we were all happy again.  I have two bitches now. It's nice.  *falls over*  and now I am here in front of my desk, my ears hooked to Linkin Park  Meteora  and I have the sudden urge to go maim. I should go level up meh newb on Achaea. That's right. Two chars. Complain, and die.  Or maybe I should go back to reading all the core books for D   I don't feel like reading, but I feel like typing. Why does my mind work with such cork-screwiness? Why?  Caleb, you have been assigned to find a cure for my insanity. You have one week. Fail, and be eliminated....well...more like...Fail, and put up with more ramblings like this one.
