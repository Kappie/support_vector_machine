In all honesty, I expect the boredom monster to emerge from the Abyss of Despair and swallow my soul, leaving a soulless being to complete my senior year for me.  And do I mind this future?  No, not really.  I wouldn't want to put my soul through another year of high school.  It's been shut up in a matchbox in the IB office long enough.
