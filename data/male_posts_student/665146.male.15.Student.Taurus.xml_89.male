It's a collection of the most horrible and bizarre happenings to have gone on around the world.  And you know as well as I do, if Chuck picked them, then they have to be mind-bending.  Furthermore, if you've never read anything by Chuck Palahniuk nor seen  Fight Club  and then thought about reading some of his stuff, then you must buy a copy of  Choke , another masterpiece by Chuck Palahniuk.  It's a story of a sex addict who works at a colonial theme park, deals with his comatose bitch of a mother (how she's a bitch  and  comatose, I'll never know), and tries to prevent himself from acquiring any morals and fulfilling his destiny of being the second coming of Jesus Christ.  Even if you hate to read, if you have even a sliver of pervert running through your blood (and everyone does, it just matters how they show it), then you can appreciate this vile piece of literature.  I also encourage reading  Survivor .  It's not the story of some bastard stranded on a desert island, it's the story of the last well-mannered survivor of the Creedish Death Cult.  Not only is this book an excellent work of art, it also teaches one how to remove blood from clothes, take bullet holes out of walls, and perfectly eat a lobster (even if the little bastard is still alive).  In one twist of the story, the protagonist hijacks an airplace and threatens to shoot anyone without manners.  "Anyone caught buttering their bread before breaking it will be shot.  Anyone who holds a red wine glass by the stem or a white wine glass by the bowl will be shot..."  Maybe I'm just rambling.  Either way, read the man's work.  If you have already, pre-order yourself a copy of his new book.
