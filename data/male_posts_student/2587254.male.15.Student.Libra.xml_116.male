Well I mean I went to service and everything...but I know in my heart and soul that that just isn't enough. I should have done more devos....which I still need to get cracking on. Today took a bit of a turn though for Good Friday Service....instead of headin' down to LCAC I went with mom to North Park. Today was a pretty quick passing day actually.....even though it started early. It was good though. Well I guess I did have some quiet time w/ me and Christ. Service was good...plus afterwards I did just sit around and have a moment of silence. Wasn't on MSN or drums or anything....well slowly I motioned over to drums. I've been pretty amused with my new 4-piece setup lately. Since my drumhead broke....the new setup actually isn't bad. Less things to hit....but waay more fun =P. And then Badminton for most of afternoon.....so dead tired after that....  So like I said before......woke up around 8:15 to go to morning Good Friday service at North Park. Couldn't really get a lift to LCAC.....but hearing how retarted Gavin and Calvin were today at church...yeah I'm kinda not regretting going to North Park lol. It was a pretty cool change though. Service was pretty quiet today. Reminded me of a Remembrance Day assembly. It was pretty quiet....remembering what Christ did and of course communion. It seems kinda weird...but sometimes when I go to North Park and see people like under 10 taking communion....I'm wondering do they really know what they're doing? I mean....it clearly says in the Bible in 1 Corinthians 11:29 it says:  "For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself."  So I'm just wondering if those younger people even know what they are doing when they take the bread and cup. Half of them I bet think it's just a mid time snack during service. It really gives me an uneasy feeling when I see them taking communion. Even today I just sat there meditating like I would at LCAC, since I'm not exactly baptized yet. Well....wait a couple more years. Congrats to Steph though....this Sunday she will be embraced by Christ through the act of baptism. Congratulations Steph on affirming Christ is your Saviour!=).  So after the service came home......sat around.....MSNed, then drummed for almost an hour. Ate...more drums lol. Then some SC. Hmm.....yeah today's pretty relaxing....needed it though since at 2-6 I'll be playing baddy, which was SO  much fun today. So I'll just zip through *sc sc, drum, eat, scsc, drum, zZzzZzzZzz* and it's now 1:30. Yeah planned with Lina and Yang to meet them at Sarnia Rd.....so I'm off!  WTH WHERE ARE THEY!? UGH! Yeah I sat around waiting for 30 minutes.....and then I just thought "OK it's been 30 minutes.....I'm gonna start walking." So I get to UCC 40 minutes later.....AND LO AND BEHOLD THEIR IN THE GYM! DESERTERS!!!! OMG! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT THEY WERE WAITING AT OTHER TRAFFIC LIGHTS! ARGH! Oh yeah and the Gavin Josh thing:  *on phone* Gavin: JOE MAKE SURE YOU WAIT FOR US. Joe: OK.  What happens? THEY GO IN! Ugh........so I ended up waiting 40 minutes out there for nothing. I felt like jamming badminton birds down his throat....but of course I wouldn't since I'm a peaceful dude =). *Sinister laugh.* Naw j/k I don't even have the voice to make one lol. Best imitation I can make is the cheap laugh Mike has at times haha. So yeah......after finding out all the people were inside already.......I FINALLY get dressed into badminton gear.....and..........BUH NU NU NUH! JOE HAS ENTERED THE COURT! *Uh who cares? He sucks at Badminton =P.*  Yeah so from 2-6.....WHAP WHAP WHAP AI YA! KUM BOA AAH! Yeah Badminton was fun. Had some REALLY good games nearing the end, but at beginning....WOW DID I SUCK AT PLAYING. Oh yeah saw Big BK there too *Brian Kung.* JT also came by and said Hi, but yeah lots of people were there. In my group alone there were like...8 of us lol. Me, Lina and two of her friends, Josh, Gavin, Calvin, and then Brian. We played some doubles....me and Josh owned Lina and her friend lol...oh yeah and Me, Gavin Josh and Calvin....MAAAD GAMES LOL. Indescribable haha. Too many jokes =P. So did tha from 2-6. Lets see....made one mad play with returning smashing......two returns then WHAM THE THIRD ONE MY RAQUET FLIES AND IT MAKES IT OVER! IT'S GOOD! WHOO! lol...what else. Oh yeah totally demolished another feather bird...this is why 15 year olds shouldnt play with feather birds. Hmm.....what else. Beat Calvin in a quick singles game up to 7, Josh and I beat Calvin and Gavin....me and Gavin lost to Calvin and Josh....Gavin skooled Josh in singles. Great times this afternoon....badminton never fails =P. When I think about it though....yeah this may be the last time I see some UWO students. Kinda noticed that again while playin' with Brian today. I mean people like Ali, Mike, Connie.....such great people movin' out back to T.O. Wish them the best of luck on future edeauvours though hehe =P.  So yeah.....playing SC with Josh and them right now. Omg it's taken them over an hour to kill Josh and it's a 3v1....me and Jason died while back lol. Yeah it's taken Calvin, Gavin and "Vboi" over an hour to pierce Josh's D.  Hmm.....yeah and I wonder if Avs are beating Stars tonight.......I was gonna watch game but meh SC caught on....plus chattin' w/ Jenn on MSN right now.   Hmm.....speaking of which I forgot when her B-Day is.....and she wants me to call her then.....Hmm.....problem? Yeah just a bit lol. Maybe if I have $$$ I can buy somethin'. Hmm....yeah I'm out for the night anyways.....leavin' w/ these words:   "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. "  -John 3:16  .....Heh one of the more famous lines from the Bible....guess just a reminder of what Easter really means. not the chocolates, capitalist commercials or Cadbury Creme Eggs. It's about remembering that Christ died for our sins, and rose 3 days later, conquering Death and giving us Eternal Life. Well yeah....I'm out for the night. Piano, Devos, maybe a bit more SC. Hehe lates all....and Happy Good Friday and Easter.
