WAIT NO! theres something on today 3. OH SWEET maths games 4. omg i didn just say that did i -.- Amazingly enough these 5 boys arose from their warm beds to enter the challenging day ahead of them. As these boys headed to St. Michael's for the maths games they all wondered what the outcome of the day would be.  As the day began the competition was thick and the competitors were ticker -.- the boys slowly climbed their way through the competition with one real goal in mind, to beat the team that so solemnly beat them the year prior, MLC.   Halfway through the day the boys were beat, their minds had worked on overdrive except maybe jun -.- Jun had somehow guessed his way through a whole challenge and he was happy, but realised how retarded he was -.-  The final event was what separated the two teams, MLC and Haileybuy, the relay... Through continuous taunting and bantering the boys pulled through with a first in year 11's and a  team content with their overall place of 5th and 1st in yr 11 rejoiced at the outcome.
