I didn't really do much at the library yesterday, just made a few notes regarding the wave-particle duality, the whole de Broglie's relationship stuff, read a few books regarding religion and philosophy. Actually, looking back, I should have spent my whole evening there, but really, the mood wasn't there, last week was better though.  But I feel good, almost like the library has become my new "church", lol. I used to go to church on weekends but now its off to the library. No more church for me, I've quitted, tada, in case you did not know. I feel liberated really, liberated in my mind. People can control any part of me, my body, but there's one thing, I would NEVER allow anybody to control my mind, nobody tells me what to think, and tell me this principle is correct that principle is wrong, I figure out myself, and I don't need your help thank you very much.  Anyway, back to that topic, about controlling my mind, exactly, well, I make my own informed decisions about my beliefs, I do not only seek scientific perspectives but also religious ones as well. I just took a test though, and they said my beliefs are more suited for neo-paganism. Y'noe what? I hate being part of something big, to be part of some spiritual xerox machine, or some spiritual factory, where spiritually "strong" people are manufactured. Its like I'm a soldier ushered into some rank and file, being told what to think what to do.  God encouraged individuality, he encourages personal style of worship, and revelation, stuff like that. God reveals himself not only in religion, but also in science, in art, in nature. So, the church telling me that only THEY have the true revelation of God is repulsive. A christian bookshop should not only sell christian stuff but also beethoven, mozart, U2, Rush. Van Gogh stuff like that. Such stuff is from God, and they worship God, even if the artist did not mean it to be that way, but the beauty is testement of God.  So anyway, enough of my ranting about the pitfalls of organized religion. I just realized that religion provides this view of reality which is incomplete, and it requires science, art etc. to fill in the gaps which also they themselves are incomplete and need religion to fill in their gaps, so its more like an inter-dependent relationship.  Its time for the church to see that there are no absolute truths nor lies.
