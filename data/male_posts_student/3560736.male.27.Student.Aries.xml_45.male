To say he flat out lied is to say that he knew the truth and yet spoke contrary to the truth. I think the most that can be said is that he had a poor representation of circumstances and presented his case based on that faulty intelligence.   However, I also agree with Steven Den Beste that the President had  urlLink other   urlLink reasons  for going to war that he did not divulge, but those are reasons that I agree with. And in any case, the charge of "lied" is still far to strong for what was done. I am not even sure that "missrepresented facts" is even in there as well. I think he spoke about the things that he knew at the time. It isn't Bush's fault that the intelligence was flawed.   I have yet to hear a truly cogent argument that Bush "lied" about anything.   The truly stupid part of the Ben  Jerry dude is that the effigy shows Bush in a flight suit with the "Mission Accomplished" slogan on the front. That's a particularly poor image to use as the banner and speech in question could be interpreted two ways: 1) the end of major combat; or 2) the end of the mission for that ship and it's crew. Both of whichh are true. All subsequent engagements ini Iraq since that speech have been on a platoon or regiment level - nothing near the level of engagement that the first few weeks of fighting entailed, and nothing that involved a regular army. So saying Bush "lied" about the "Mission Accomplished" slogan is just plain thick-headed.   UPDATE:  even the Washington Post is admitting that  urlLink Bush didn't lie - at least not about one of the primary talking points for the meme.
