It's not that I'm lazy, far from it, I got tired of hoping someone would read it and start a conversation with me about it, which never happened on a non shallow/meaningless small-talk scale.  I realized that noone took the time to read this every day, that I made noone's day brighter towards the end.  Sure, I got a few compliments, but not enough to keep my hopes up.  I guess a glimpse into some stupid kid's life is not what society wants to see.  So, for now, I'll be going on with my normal life. If you want to know about my day, talk to me. I'll sure tell you a story, maybe not something hugely amusing, but something.  Maybe someday I'll feel it necessary to exploit the daily thoughts and activitie of my life on the internet for public viewing pleasure. But, who knows when that day will be.  Farewell.
