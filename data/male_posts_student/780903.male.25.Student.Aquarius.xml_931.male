Yeaaaaaaaaagh!").  I'm kinda psyched about it.  If I'm coming up with the same joke as Dana Carvey, that's not bad company to be in.  I remember his sketch comedy show from about 7 or 8 years ago -- only lasted a handful of episodes, but I thought it was hilarious.  Wish it was on DVD.  Can't find it.  Maybe on e-bay.  Also, thanks to  urlLink Howard Bashman  for the link to my post below about the 40 leadership positions on the Harvard Law Review.  AND: For anyone who can't get enough, I'm guest-blogging over at  urlLink Crescat Sententia  this week, honored simply to have been asked.  It's a cool blog.  I just (literally, just a minute ago) posted my first piece over there, which mentions Pasta, Saddam Hussein, and Abortion, all in the space of three paragraphs.  I think I've just guaranteed a hit from the next person who googles "Abortion Pasta."  You know, for the big italian buffet that always accompanies the occasion.  I wouldn't write that if it wasn't coming up on 2 A.M.  I think it's time for bed.
