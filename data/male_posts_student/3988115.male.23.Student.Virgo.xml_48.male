Its basically just a little program that lets you easily post images to your blogs. That's how I posted Mr. T. I think it also lets you post regular blogs, but it makes it much easier since it does it in an IM format, you just type up your blog and hit Send, you don't have to be logged in on any webpage.  You can get this software from  urlLink www.hello.com   You can also make blogs via email, I haven't done this yet but I know its possible. You just email the blog site and it posts what you send.  If things go as I predicted originally, we should have a flood of disturbing and funny images in no time...  Alex can post goatse for us, I think he knows the address for that image
