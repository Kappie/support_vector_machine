Well, let's look at what actually happens when you say something.  Wouldn't you agree that how your voice sounds to you is different from how it actually sounds to someone else? I'm sure you know exactly what I mean, especially if you've ever heard your own voice on a recording. The reason for this is that when you hear yourself say something, you hear it with two ears, the inner and outer (not left and right :P ). The effect these words have on you is, basically, to influence your subconcious mind.  I'm sure you can see what I'm driving at now.  By saying, "I can't..." you are sending a message to your subconcious mind that you are unable to do whatever it is that you said. As a result, the next time you try to do something, you have a lack of confidence and if you fail, the experience confirms what you 'knew' to be true already. However, the inverse is also true. By saying, "How can I...?" you send a message that is a catalyst for your subconcious mind to figure out a way to do it.  I think we'd all agree, it's much better to be able to do something and choose not to, that to not be able to do it at all.  So what about the "I must..." or "I have to..."? This goes back to that sense of Responsibility that is lacking from modern society. By saying either of these two phrases (or something similar) you are programming your subconcious to beleive that you have no choice in the matter and therefore no responsibility in the decision.  Not good.  Life doesn't just happen to you. You are where you are in life because of the decisions you made in the past. If you do some serious and honest soul searching you'll realize that this is true, and you have at least some portion of responsibility for what's "happened to you".  So what do you do? Simple...   carpe diem   Jonathan
