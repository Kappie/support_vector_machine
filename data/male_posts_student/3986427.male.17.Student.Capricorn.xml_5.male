I've always thought that spiders don't like fabrics (don't ask me why I had that idea). Anyways, hell if I was going to touch it. Not that it's dangerous or anything... It's just shitugly. So I picked up one of my slippers and tried to push it to the ground with a swift stroke, but the spider apparently had other plans as it ran  into  my trousers. Yay-bloody-hooray! So I decided to deal with it after I had a shower. When I got out I brushed my teeth and all that while thinking of a way to get rid of the spider... after a while of intense thinking, I found out that throwing the trousers and jumping up and down at it like a maniac was probably the best idea... I was  not  going to turn them inside out to look after the little devil. The thought of having one of those bastards running up my sleeve isn't exactly my idea of happy-hour... so when I accomplished my barbaric act, I threw the pants in the laundry... now it's mom's problem.  I feel a slight pity for the spiders who wilder off into houses, not able finding their way out again... and here we are killing them any chance we get... oh well. That's survival of the fittest for you!
