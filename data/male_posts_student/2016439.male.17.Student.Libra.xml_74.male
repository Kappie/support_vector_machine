Seriously, what they need to train AP students to do is not to memorize all the material on the test.  No, sir, that's the easy part.  We should have had extensive yoga and meditation sessions beginning this semester so that we could have prepared ourselves to endure the grueling mental activity that the test takes.  I really don't think my cerebral neurons have experienced that much activity in a long time.  Now, I'm always happy to give that big muscle in my head a workout, but do you know how sometimes when you haven't worked out a muscle for a while, it gets tired and/or cramps?  Yeah, that's kind of what today felt like.  So after taking the AP U.S. History test, I went back to school and, after a brief meeting with the principal and school vendors, rushed to my teacher's room where there was nothing but card games going on and food and drinks being passed around.  Mrs. I said the class is pretty much over (hallelujah!  Praise the Lord!  and all that other good stuff), which is great.  And as a bonus, we got to watch part of  To Kill a Mockingbird  in English.  Yeah, I'd already determined that I wasn't going to do an ounce of work in that class today, so it was good Mrs. A made it easier on all of us, hehe.  And for those of you who are wondering, yes, I did watch Friends last night, and well...I'll drag myself to admit that the final episode was okay (don't you dare ask me to do any better than that), but I don't think I've missed much in the last 10 years.  I'll take the 10 years of the TV Guide Channel over Friends anyday ;-)  It's the weekend!  I have no responsibilities to take care of: no drill with the Young Marines, no one to meet, absolutely, positively  nothing !  Well, except for read 700-something pages of my government book.  Yeah, I still have one more AP test to go.  Blech...
