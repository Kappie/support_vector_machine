I still haven't done  half  the things I'd wanted to do by the time I was 21; have my own band, have a relationship (stable or otherwise), have a decent income, have gotten  somewhere  in my life...  OK, let's look at this objectively, shall we?  I'm (theoretically) in my final year of my degree - which I never thought I'd do. I have lots of wonderful friends; Neal, Kirra, Paris, Michael, Jessica, Angela, Trista, Kimberly, Angus, Haylee, Angus, Kirsty, Alex, Dave, Brooksie, Kat, Kat, Bronwen, Allan, Sean... I'm looking at youse guys. Thanks for being there, you've been great.  I'm a composer, which I guess is the next-best-thing to having my own band, but I dunno.. something just feels missing. That'd be the relationship factor.  I know, I know... relationships aren't the cure to all of life's problems, but I'm 24 and I've never had a proper girlfriend. That kind of shit doesn't make you feel better about yourself. People tell me I'm good looking and all, and girls have been interested in me, but they lose intrest in me as soon as I act interested in them. It's fucked. Fucked, I tell you.  If any of you girls that I've liked are reading this (fat chance, but hey, you never know), I'd be very appreciative if you'd just  urlLink let me know  why you went off me or whatever. Really.  I really wish my birthday wasn't so damned close to Valentine's day =(
