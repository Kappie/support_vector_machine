Twas a good time. I only have fun with Runa when it's just the two of use but shes my favorite. THe movie itself was excellent. It was very accurate to most if not all points. It makes me laugh because a lot of christians were offended by what, in my opinion, is the truth. You'll have to see everything cuz I don't want to ruin it like what Sweeney did. But it really SERVES all the little bible huggers who cant take a joke. Actually I would say it was my favorite movie so far this year. It was a bit chick flicky but still it amde it's point very nicely. I want to see Farenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine because they looked really interesting/eyeopening/funny.
