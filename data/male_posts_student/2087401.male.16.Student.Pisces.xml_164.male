I'm gonna give you the short version I gave Sasha when she asked how the movie went.(slightly extended)  We went the wrong way, we got back on track,we arrived half an hour late, we walked around trying to think of something to do, I let a hot girl tell me what to do so we nearly got killed by three thug-looking guys at The House,we decided to go home, the car broke down, the car started again, we got terribly lost (again) and ended up 28 miles out side the city, then we (finally) went home.  And that's it.  I'm going back to bed.
