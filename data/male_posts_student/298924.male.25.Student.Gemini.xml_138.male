Now I gotta tell you I wasn't so keen on the idea of Blues and Boogie, but man it was really fun!....I had a blast and the music was great....the guy who performed at first was just aight...but when the guy Michael Burke and his band arrived I was into it....He played some songs I recognized in a Bluesy/funky way (Hey Joe, Going to Kansas City, some non christmasy version of Please Come Home for Christmas)....fun was had by all involved....it was just a really good time....  On the way home I saw FOUR Nashville police cars around one car that apparently had committed some moving violation....and on Sunday at the Hooters on Harding Place I saw two cars pull one man over for not having a seatbelt....I ask is this city that lame that it takes that much manpower for such a minor violation??....not only that, they also have a tendency to block the entrance to places that are STILL OPEN.....such as the time I was at Kroger and a dude ran a red light and they blocked the entrance to give him a ticket....I swear this "big city" where they make the street lights blink at 11:30 has a waaaaaaaaaaay to go....
