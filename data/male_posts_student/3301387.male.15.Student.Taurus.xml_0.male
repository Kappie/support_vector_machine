Fuck i mean I cleared 9 steps and i used to be sooo good at stairs and just yesterday i was struggling with four. OMFG. Oh my fuckin god. Tat makes me think of this guy by the name of Lim Yong Zheng. Fucking says 'oh my wife' Sounds wierd to the ears. Jux yesterday when i was sk8in with Lim and elyas at commonwealth stairs at bout 8. This fuckin fog started to form. Really freaked me and elyas Out man. Elyas was like "DUDE what the fuck was that??" I was like  Let's get the fuck outta here. And lim was like 'Go's prescence is here, he has blessed us' and blah blah blah yadayadayada. so we were ok ok let's jux get the fuck away then we went to the bus stop.  Like the bus stop was like across the street and the only way across was the overhead. We took it and at the top there was this shit that stumped me. It was just this huge tall extremely white wall. It was sooo bloody fuckin wierd looking.  and yea anyways we went to the bus stop then we started rapping and singing and stuff. I told lim to tell me when 105 came but he made me miss it. Damn that dumb fuck. oh well, then we started rapping again and we were smokin and there was so nobody. Occasionally some cars went past but we were alone and BOY WE WERE LOUD and RAWkking... Their bus came, they took 123 to somerset and my bus was just behind, 105. Good deal, good day. It was great. Can hardly wait for Friday. Oh...and the struggling with 4 steps? I realised it was just my mind. After we had this long break and rapping and chatting and laughin bout life and smoking. Went back, had fun. 100% clear every single one. hell of a nosebone ollie. :D Friday friday come come soon. lalalalala.
