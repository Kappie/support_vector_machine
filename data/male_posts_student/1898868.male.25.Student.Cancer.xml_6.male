This frees up her apartment in Chicago, where she has a lease (paid by the company) through September -John and some friends take the opportunity to spend the summer in Chicago, where they will work small-time jobs and attempt to shoot and sell a skating video  -In the meantime, John and his friends are seen by another kid their age who is an intern at a Mancow-esque radio show... they begin doing on-air stunts every once in a while for extra money  -Intern has connections to Mtv, who hears/sees them, and signs them to a contract to do a few videos... they decide to forego their junior year of college at OSU and stay for the year in Chicago.  The $$ they get from the Mtv video deal is just enough to pay for an apartment for them, so they all continue their crummy jobs (John works at a bar where they let his band play every week or so).  -After decent to low sales, the videos get shelved by Mtv  -They continue their jobs for a 2nd year, again foregoing a return to college (which he is beginning to get some pressure from his parents to do)... now he is hoping that his band is what will take off, not necessarily the skating videos  -the band is decent, but not great - he plays bass and shares the singing with another friend  -They are, however, friends with another band who DOES begin to take off.  The band is signed and asked to do a video.  They know that John and his friends are funny and have some experience with videos, so they ask them if they will star in it.  The video stars them doing stunts and maybe some tricks (getting hurt, playing jokes on each other), and the music video becomes really popular.  -Mtv execs see the video and want to know who the dudes are.  Then they find out that they actually have the dudes under a contract option to do a season show (the contract, meanwhile, was only signed by the mancow-intern/friend/future villain)  -The contract options them for 7 episodes (again, not for a lot of money - just enough for them to keep living in the apartment)... they're aired and the show is a big hit called "treat'd."  -In the last episode (the 8th?), the villain screws them, and John and the others get arrested while the villain is signed to do lead a 2nd season and make a ton of money  -Thus, the stage is set for our screenplay!!  Again, there's a lot of info here and I don't think that most of it should be in the movie, because it's all background stuff that happens way before the movie even starts.  But it's good if we can all get a feel for the characters.
