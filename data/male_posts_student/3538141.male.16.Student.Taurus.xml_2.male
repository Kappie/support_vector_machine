As for next year, I still don't really know what to do.  I dropped history for GCSE, but now really regret it, want to take it up again, which my school offers.  I also want to do Maths, Spanish, French and Latin.  I can only do four, unless I do French out of block.  But I am boring you all with details.  University I dunno what to do either.  I would love to study Chinese, simply because I would want to go there and generally love the culture (and the kung fu!).  Also a very important place in terms of world politics etc.  Still, that is a dream, and I still do not know if i can realise it.  In a couple of years, my ambitions may have changed - I had completely different ambitions at different stages in my childhood, although this one seems more permanent.  I probably want to Cambridge University, although apparently SOAS in London is very good for Chinese.  I'm always doing this - right in the middle of my GCSE's and I'm dreaming of the future.  That is all for today, will probably post tomorrow. P.S.  For a pic of me, go to http://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=OQESNMA=HJK where I'm pretending to be 18!  :P
