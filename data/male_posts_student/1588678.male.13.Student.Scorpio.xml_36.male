After seeing this film, it made me realize why it’s R. Billy Bob Thornton was great! So was the kid in the movie.  Why It’s R - Holly shit, there’s a bunch of dirty crap in this movie. He works at the mall as Santa Claus, goes to work totally drunk, gets pissed on by kids, curses every friggin’ second, has sex in a Nordstrum changing room, steals a BMW, and gets a lady pined up to a pinball machine and proceeds to hump her. Okay, must I go any further?   Acting - Billy Bob Thornton was great! He was THE person to do this film. For the only few films I’ve seen him in, I had nothing bad to say. His a real good actor. As for the kid (who was chubby, talkative, and made fun of) he was good.  It was a sort of a clash. I mean, here’s a drunk loser who dresses as Santa Claus living with a little fat kid who gets on his nerve all of the time. Not to mention Billy Bob’s character hates kids. It was a funny combination.   My Grade - Well, it’s kinda hard to decide, so, I give it ****. It was very good! If you like movies like Old School or Saving Silverman, you’ll like this one! Go and see it while it’s still in theaters!
