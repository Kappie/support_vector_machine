There were public showers there where homeless people could get cleaned up. I dreampt that I was going to take a shower there for some reason... but... I don't know how this happened. I took of my pants and for some reason I walked out of the public shower place and onto the sidewalk by the street and walked. Everybody started running away and I was like "why are you running away?!?!?" and I had no pants on and I kept walking around the city like that until this cop chases me so I run around the city trying to throw her off... then I take my shirt off and run into this restaurant and the whole time the cop is trying to find me. I take a shower and find this shirt in there and put it on (::thinks:: hopefully she won't recognize me) and when I open the door, she's in a cop's uniforn still but she goes "UPS" and she's holding a UPS package and i'm thinking "wtf"... anyway, she's like.... "I know you" and she throws down the package and she licks my cheek (for some odd reason) then she grabs my hand and handcuffs it and takes me to jail. Ok.. what in the hell was that all about.  ~ George... going home today.  TV: off Music: John Hurt's Big Leg Blues (what I listened to last) Mood: I dunno... normal-ish(?)
