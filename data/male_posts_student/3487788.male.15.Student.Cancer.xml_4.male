This is what happened in my dream.. it's a pretty nice one, i have never get a better one than this, and may be a dream that may always leave a mark in my heart. It's about 'her', someone i like in the past, now and will like in maybe, future... well.. nobody will be sure about that. She started to talk to me again, she's accepted me.. woohoo.. that will be really great.. but.. it's just a dream. She treats me so different.   Ever since i confess to her, her attitude towards me had changed: rejected at all times I ask her out; talks to me only when I talk to her.. I feel really bad, wonder if anyone will be able to help me..
