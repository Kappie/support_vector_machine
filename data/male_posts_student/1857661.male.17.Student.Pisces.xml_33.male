There was a table behind me with 4 persons, 2 middle-aged men and 2 ladies. All in a sudden, one of the guy slapped the girl in front of the public. Then, the 2 ladies left, and the food was just served, they were not even touched when that happened. The 2 guys kept on eating as if the guy just now just did the right thing to the girl! What a horrible scene!  After lunch, my stepmom, sister and I went to do a little shopping that lasted for an hour. My stepmom bought a clothe while my sister went to a ringtone shop and purchased some ringtones. The whole outing was boring. I met Chee Yeong there. He went to collect his prefect uniform. My stepmom then asked me how old is he as he looks quite young. She was shocked when I told her that he's only Form 1. She has always thought that I don't mix around with younger kids. Sigh...
