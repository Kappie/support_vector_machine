I am in love, have you ever noticed how love is either the best or the worst thing in the world. I am in love with a boy named Ryan. But to the best of my knowledge he does not love me back. I think he is in love with my friend Mike, but he could turn out to not even be gay. He reminds me of Shinji from NGE. I guess that would make me Kaworu. Well, that's all I'll divulge today.
