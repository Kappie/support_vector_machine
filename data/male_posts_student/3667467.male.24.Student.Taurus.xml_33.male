Luckily, I took a class in the summer, keeping me on track with a full-time courseload. One class I was especially happy to get into was abbreviated in the class listing as "CRIT ISS MUS STU". "Cool," I thought, "Critical Issues in Muslim Studies! This is perfect considering the state of the world. I could really get into this one." While buying the books I noticed they seemed to discuss art and other strange topics not directly involving politics. "Cool," I thought, "They're going to look at this from a completely different angle: a cultural standpoint and our interpretations of that standpoint." Then I get into class, and ignore what was written on the board until one minute before class starts: "Critical Issues in Museum Studies". Doh! Well, it meets my requirement so I'm staying. Jiminy.
