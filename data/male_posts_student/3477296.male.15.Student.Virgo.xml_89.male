Looks like im becomingthe black sheep of the group...(Shouldnt be"Introspective" rather "Christospective")   You know what...Im excited too. Not the fact Andys a Christian (thats excitement already) but the real excitement is the fact that...wait...      MANLY BEAT THE BYE AND HAVE GOT 2 VICTORIES IN A ROW         YESSSSSSSSSS!!! IM SO DAMN HAPPY!!! Its a been struggle for months but its eventually happened. JOY, DELIGHT, HAPPINESS!!! YESSSSSSSS!!!    Plus, I Robot is only a week away...Its going to be an absolute blockbuster.   The negatives: Schools starting soon.Equals work. Equals pressure. Equals CRAP.   TO END: The Offspring with theirhit "Spare Me The Details"   My girlfriend, my dumb donut
