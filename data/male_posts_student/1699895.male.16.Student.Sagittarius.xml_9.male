I think as you get older, you get to realize what Christmas is all about, and thats family, and the people you love....but If you tell me "OH, All I want for christmas is to be with (person)....BULLSHIT!!! Regardless to who you are, and all the people you love, your just a human, and humans have a desire for things to keep them haapy.   I'm not saying that you DON'T want to see your friends and fam, I'm just saying stop lying to yourselves, you fat cat bastards...maybe some people can live with just being with someone, but I'll tell ya, its a tough world out there, just remember, 90% of the time, people are assholes, they don't care about you, live with it...so now tell me what you REALLY want for christmas..MATERIAL POSSESSION WISE!!  I think christmas is a balance of the love of one self and of others....don't make yourself miserable just to please others, but don't totally ignore them either...you must be able to maintain a state of homeostasis.  Only when you love someone, should it be of your life and fortune...but COME ON!! PATHETIC little teenagers running around thinking they know what love really is.  Even with immature adults feel the same way, of to the end of depression and then kill themselves.....Let's be reasonable people....you can love someone, with all your heart, but PA-LEASE...if your still in highschool, don't expect it to be some Romeo and Juliet thing. You can only be ignorant and young, but that doesn't mean you can't be wise!!  I'm perfectly happy with the way my life is going, I have no regrets, and I'm ready to make people feel happy about themselves...yes, there is love in there air, and I hope things turn-out OK!  If you feel the need to talk to me about this, IM me at Murhur18 or e-mail me...  ....until then, I'm goning to figure out what would happen if that guy from smashing pumpkins lost his car keys. OVER AND OUT!!
