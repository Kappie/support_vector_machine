I was so excited and he sang great and Nickel Creek was there and Third Eye Blind and most importantly  Josh Kelley!  Post not checked for spelling because I'm still buzzing about the concert and my personal meeting with  Josh Kelley!  And  Josh Kelley  is going to be on 'The Late Late Show' in a few minutes! Sweet!
