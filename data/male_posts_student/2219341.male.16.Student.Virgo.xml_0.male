OH MAN IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD!  OH DANG!  i did stop at Sketcher's and picked up 2 pairs of shoes.  just cuz i was bored.  hahahaha!  my legs hurt real bad cuz of all the walkin.  well actually its more cuz of the standing.  the walkin made it feel better.  anyways.  feelings again have not changed much.  it's gettin easier to hide them.  but not much has changed.  i dunno...they arent bad feelings.  just natural i guess...to miss someone.  i cant say im depressed about it.  cuz im really not.  ya just miss it....yanno?  yeah.  Alias is on in a bit.  mom and i will be watchin it as we usually do.  i love my mom.  i should tell her i do more often.  i really do though.  she's one of the few people who understand me.  well at least a little.  anyways. kris is gettin a bit emotional now.  must go.  au revoir.
