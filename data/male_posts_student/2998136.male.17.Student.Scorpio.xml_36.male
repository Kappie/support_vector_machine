But before that, I went to my long-time-haven't-meet IRC friend's house to fix a harddisk into his PC. It gave me a sense of satisfaction and that shows what I am capable of.  So after that, we departed together from his house to meet his IRC friend at Clarke Quay MRT station to go clubbing. I was quite surprise that his IRC friend actually brought a group of people. 2 Ah Lians and 1 office boy. Ok, I was quite scared. Aiya I think better tell you my IRC friend's name lar. His name is called William, surname is Hung. Full name is William Hung.   One of the hilarious thing is that the Ah Lian teased William, you know what that Ah Lian asked him, she asked him "You really stay at West ar?", then William Hung replied "Ya". The ah lian immediately laughed to her friend "Wah, he really travel West to retrieve scripture(A sacred writing or book)". If you translate that into Mandarin and you know the story of the Monkey God, you will get it. What a joke for a Vista Day! Haha  We walked to MS from there and William's IRC friend collected $20 from everyone for the entrance fee to the club. I am underage and I did not bring IC along with me, so I pass my ITE ez-link card to William's friend to the bouncer and don't know what they said to the bouncer. Voila, I can enter.   The club is called "Angel". But actually it's a devil to me, the music there cannot make it. All those old technos.. that kills my mood of dancing. It limits my creativity. So sian.... kind of wasted my money.. But nevermind, luckily I drank many glasses of Martell to make it up. William's friend opened 1 and a half bottle of Martell with coke.  Let's called this William's friend "ABC". ABC kepts on serving me those drinks... we played the Guessing game and I kept on losing to him. Whenever I lose, I have to take a drink of the Martell with coke once. It's obvious that he is trying to make me drunk. But not so easy, you think I am that easily down? All thanks to my dad, who hardly been drunk before. Thanks him for passing the genes to me. Later on, ABC wanted me to drink "On the rock" meaning just purely the Martell without anything added I guess. So he got a small glasses of purely Martell and I drank it up at one go. He did that too after me. But both of us are still not drunk, he carried on with his dancing.  Just about when the last bottle of Martell is going to finish up, they poured 2 glasses of Martel purely. ABC's friend requested me to drink half a glass, so I drank. And they showed admiration to me.... I felt so honoured. Well, I do not intend to show off or what. I just simply gave them the face and entertain them. Throughout the whole night, been to the toilet up and down many times. My urine is whiter than usual. I do feel a bit dizzy and was quite sleepy... I felt even more dizzy especially walking past the dance floor with the light flashing at a fast rate non-stop. I could fall anytime but I am not really drunk to that extend.  It's weird that the more I drink, the more drowsy I feel instead of drunkness. We chilled out till the club closed at around 3.45 am and they went back home in taxi, but William and I take the NightRider back home. They were so rich and ABC is quite generous to treat us Martell. I haven't thanks them for that. I have been thinking suspicious in my mind, what uterior motive he has got to treat us the drinks. We just know each other the first time. I wondered.  The story here is being cut short because it would took hours for me to finish up the whole incident of last night.  I will continue the next time....
