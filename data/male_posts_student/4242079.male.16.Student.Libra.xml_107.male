It's a line that I'm being quite careful not to cross, but I think I may have crossed it already.  I know I crossed it with the last two. I tried not to, I tried to keep things platonic, or at least very very casual. It could never last that way, though. As soon as some one, him or her, or both. takes their pants off, the relationship is pretty much over, because you've crossed the line. I'm not saying that is the line. No, the line comes way before that. I'm just saying that once you get there, the line has obviously already been crossed. And when you cross the line there's only two directions you can take. Either you're ready for some kind of relationship, or things fall apart and crumble away and you never see her again.  I am a firm believer that people should be allowed to do whatever they desire, so long as they are not harming anyone else, or anyone eles's property in the process. Yet look at me, I choose to hurt people. I hurt her, and her, and her. And now it comes to you. I don't want to hurt you, but is it avoidable? Really? Do you think there's anyway to overcome the emotional roadblocks that have been placed in front of me? The ones that make me tremble in fear at the mere mention of the word "girlfriend"?  All I can do is stand here, alone, in the middle of it all, and apologize.   Apologies will never be able to turn back time
