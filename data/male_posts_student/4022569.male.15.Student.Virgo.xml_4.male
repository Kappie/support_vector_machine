They handle acts like maroon5 and some others thatI have never heard of.Though officially maroon5 is singed with J-Records, they started at Octone Records.I read their article on what they want to include in your demo package. That includes, a CD/tape/vhs, influences, contact info, a list of songs on the CD/tape/vhs. I hope to someday soon send in a demo.If it works out great! If not it's still fun to to have tried.    AlsoI went looking for information on how a recording contract works.I found an article written byan entertainment attorney on some of the technicalities of a contract. AllI know is there is a lot to know abouthow contracts work. Stuff likerecoupment, royalty points, and someincumbent collateral thing that involved a lot of other enormous words.
