The cold is so crisp, so invigorating; it wakes you up, heightens your senses (that is, of course, until you go numb...but we're accentuating the positive here!). The extreme cold is so very primal! Going outside is like an adventure, and I feel a bond with all the people I see while I am out. We are all out there enduring, nay embracing, the cold -- boldly venturing forth onto this wonderfully exposed prairie (area thingie what ever it is, damn you word screw up my spiel!) Anyways we are all exposed. That may be what it is that I like about the cold. You feel so exposed to the universe, like you really are walking about on the skin of this big planet that is spinning around in a big, cold universe. The sky above is large and crystal clear, and gone is the blanket of heat that normally presses upon us. Doesn't a really cold, clear night make you look up at the sky? Count the stars, trace the constellations, make your own.  And in the cold air looking at vast heavens you feel vulnerable and alone...and yet still connected? Whew!  INTENSE!  So, I had to take my pills so I had half a box of Oreos for breakfast w/ a nice big glass of milk to wash it down...Gotta love Oreos for breakfast, but I think I definitely ate WAY TOO many cookies, so I basically didn't eat lunch as a result. I can't wait to get back to school so that I'm not such a glutton, wait I am in school!  Dammit. I don't intend to bring much food so that I don't pig out like I do here, then I'll lose the pounds I've gained since coming here.    So, WINTERFEST CAME!  Like dude it was great.  First off Dominick, Darlene, John (whew), and Sara went bowling, which I won btw.  I got to grab John’s arse not once but twice and not a hand, full gropage.  Then we had to take him to work in the Dells, and then we went to Sara’s and played LIFE, were I was a doctor making $30,000, not the $100,000 I should have been, and I have two sets of twins: Jeron, Aaron, Darrin, and Mike.  And ummm my husband was the guy who had his butt groped for the name was a group effort.  ^^LOOK ABOVE IF LOST!^^  And, and, and I had the Tudor, that wasn’t paid for till I went to night school.  Then to get ready:  Darlene honey I am sorry I burned you not once but twice. Hunny, not intentional!  Haha, your forehead doesn't look to bad.  Sorry about those shakes.  I hope you get better!   Then to the dance:  Hehe, I am THE SLUTTIEST DANCER AT MHS! And of course I am the SLUTTIEST MALE!  Mrhahahahahahahaha! It was really fun and I thought I was cute.  I got to wear a tiara.   So anyways, I got to see my friend’s piano teacher.  Like wowwies!  He is HOTT.  That piano teacher I mean not my friend, well he is kinda hott! But the teacher is the 'lets-bang-on-the-piano' kinda hott. (Kinky are we?) Not the 'lets-bang-the-piano'. And seeing all the music rooms, the music being played, the recital hall, the people there, I felt such an incredible sense of belonging. As the different tunes danced through my head I was telling myself, this is where I belong; there is where I should be. It was a little bittersweet. Oh yeah, and did I mention all the hot music guys? OH MY GOD! Let me tell you, guys with artistic blood running through their veins give off a completely different air about them. It's so damned sexy.  But I have little musical talent, but I can enjoy the hell out of it!  Haha, I need to get to a show choir competition.  Whew!   So!  I played an interesting game of Scrabble. Due to the slowness of some players (like Me) I was able to think of new and innovating ways to make Scrabble fun and not so slow and boring. For example:  *clears throat* everyone has a glass window in front of them and a tiny hole to put their letters down to spell words. But wait! Everyone is equipped with a knife, so if a hand comes out, they can begin the slashing! So this means you have to have either fast hands or small words. And if they are small words, you will surely lose the game. This helps builds dexterity, and maybe even immunity to blood loss! However, not only is there physical trouble, but verbal trouble! Everyone/Anyone can say whatever they want. They can talk trash, how they slept with your mom, how stupid they are what words to put/not put, why they are even playing the game, etc... This part of the game helps build on learning how to block out everyone's voices, or how to make witty come backs in a span of a few seconds. ‘Cuz we all know that "your mom" is such a dumbass remark that only a faggot would say. However, a lot of people say that, thus meaning we have a lot of faggots in this world, which is very exciting!  More bois, is the words of Jeron’s card more toys.  (BLAH!)  Bois aren’t toys to me. So as you can see, this "Prison Scrabble" is training ground for people that want to be 1337 in every aspect. Possibly the only thing that you will lack after this game is your life, not too important.  And that's just a slight chance of 99%. So in reality, it's a good investment and a must buy game. And I am expecting to have tournaments by the end of the year. Hopefully Scrabble will accept this as another version that will help spread their wonderful name throughout the world.
