I wish I had some cologne so that I could start an entire conversation about it.  Oh, and I would also like some celebrities sitting here next to me with which to do the conversing.  That would be nice.  Alas, I have no cologne, nor do I have celebrities.  I just got off the phone a little while ago with one of my friends from school who I had not talked to in a while.  He was telling me how he got a job working on cars with his uncle over the summer.  I told him I am an Online Editor.  He asked what I edit.  I told him, "Bye."  He's never heard of that online newspaper.  Neither have I.  Hey, here's a  urlLink plug .  Go visit Annie and her Amazing Works of Art.  Seriously, she's good.  Stop boring me.  I'm just kidding, you know I love you :)  Who else will waste countless hours sitting here and reading the stupid stuff that I write?  Just to show you that I care about you as well, I'll post something else here within a week.  Maybe.  Back to Norton.
