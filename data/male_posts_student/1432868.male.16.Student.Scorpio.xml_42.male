What they will care about is what you know and  what you can do for yourself (if self-employed) or your employer.           Also, I hate how people in Potomac are so stressed over what college they will go to. MY message is it doesn't really matter that much. No matter what college you go to you are probably going to like it. Second, in the long run it does not effect your pay or job level. There are Harvard Grads that are bum's in the street (not many) and people who went to unknown colleges who do great things. There are even complete idiots who went to Yale (dubya). Lastly,   fear not   for a college will accept you. It may not be your first choice, it might not even be your second choice, but one college will accept you.
