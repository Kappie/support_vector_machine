Ya... yesterday got the band concert, then after school went home, took a bathe, nap, then 3++ meet justin they all. After that we went to cine raiders play gunbound and cs. Then after that we play bowling, i first game on form, personal best 174...haha...they call justin turkey king, i double king. Then after that went to eat then straight away cheong to the singapore conference hall. Quite alot ppl there, then we all cheong to the last row to sit. Apart from the occasional screaming and shouting, it was quite boring the concert, but aiya, its mainly because we don't know how to appreciate music, but the band members did generally a good job. The climax of the concert was at the last part, where everybody were shouting and screaming. Then they played the school song. We all stood up and sang the school song, Everybody like turn back to look at us. That was the best moment of my life, i dont regret choosing and coming into maris stella high, this is wat it is all about, "brotherhood". Then after that the band members shouted our marist chant, then we replied. Keep on shouting and shouting, after that abit seh. Then all cheong to lao pa sha to eat. only 10 plus ppl, reach there that time 3 ppl arrange table for us, then don know which one to join, so paiseh. After that stone here and there, then all decided to return home. Haizz... maybe this is about the last time we can cheong until like that, since Os is approaching. I couldnt help but think about wat is gonna happen after Os, our 4 years of frenship, so many happy moments together. We could get together even after the Os, but got new friends liao, it will never be the same again. Haiz, life is like this, we hav to move on. and when we die, we bring these memories away with us.
