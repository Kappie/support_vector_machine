Some have begun to call it "Trousergate" and  urlLink Wizbang  has one of the more inflationary quotes I've seen about it.   I'm not ready to go to the level of "the Watergate for the new mellennium" yet, but on the surface it certainly appears that Berger will have to answer to some pretty serious allegations. With all the spin on this story we're not likely to know the extent of it for some time.   Developing.    UPDATE:  the  urlLink Hambergler  - Very funny.    MORE:  Now Berger has  urlLink stepped down  as an advisor to Kerry.
