Super: the guy who maintains the apartment building. Hmmm...Was the party the guy who maintains the apartment building, hmmm...Don't think so. Super: as in to have powers associated with heat vision, flying, and x-ray vision, and of course the super strength , none of which the party had. Super: Great, hmmm...Was the party great? I guess so since all the other choices don't work in context. I still don't see how it was a surprise. I was giving it away, she became suspicious but didn't throw around any accusations till it was too late. Ha Ha Victory!
