I think its cool, and its so easy now, go Macromedia Studio. Go!  email blog to blogger dooby, which is great, cause i can write a pissed off  message, it will save in Outlook and its saved, and its emailed right to my  blog. its so simple! Horaay for everything. Horaay for the new photo sending  thing where I can post up pictures, but I really don't need to...Cause I have my  OWN webpage for that.  The best part is that it was free oop! I better go finish more Bios and get to  around to those quizes  the Things that should shape our world  page.
