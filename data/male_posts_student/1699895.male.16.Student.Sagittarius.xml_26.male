I guess The only reason people come here is to see what I've been doing, so i'll just give you a recap of my vacation.  On Friday 19th, There was old friend (not literally old) Ashley Morris, who had her annual christmas party. The party was sweet, I think its safe to say we all had a great time who went. I left at like midnight and walked to Seans and crashed at his place.  On Saturday the 20th I saw Lord of The Rings: Return of The King, twice, once with Sean, and again with Evan and Jordan. LOTR:ROTK was probobly the best one out of the three, or so I think...after that I think Jordan and Evan just crashed at my place and we watched Requim of a Dream, which is another shizzit movie.  Sunday I was about to go to church, but I slept till noon....  Monday I went out to a few malls to go Christmas shopping for family, because I'm poor, have no money, and can't get crap, so to only be fair was to give my friends nothing. I know, it seems thoughtless but, fuck, I didn't get anything from anybody. It's OK, I didn't really want anything. Also,  went to one of Davy Boys hockey games, and they won, agaisnt the Flyers, and I know most of the people on that team, including Dietz, Wood, and Andy.  HAHA!  Tuesday I think I just hung out with DB and Jordan, I think Melissa too. I ended up crashing at either Jordans or DBS, I'm not sure.  Wednesday was Christmas Eve.  Basically helped my mom around the house for Christmas and also I think I hung with Evan. He loves to play Flash computer games.   CHRISTMAS!! Few things I got  -DVD/VHS Combo -2 CDs (Both Stephen Lynch) -Final Fantasy XI for PC -L-Desk -19" TV -Sweet Corvette phone  -Adidas Cologne -Axe and other shizit I wont go on. Haynie and Jordan came over, and we went to DBs, where there was also Brenna, Danielle, Greg, Melissa, and Drew. We watched Seabiscuit. crashed at my place  Friday 26th, there was hockey at St. Mikes. Evan, Sean, Andy, Joe, and I were there. Brian came late, but hes the best so it was koo.  Pretty even teams, it was tied most of the time, and it ended winning off a deflection by Sean. After that, we went to White Castle and got some Crave Cases and I went home and crashed thurr.  Saturday, I woke up at 1 and built the L-Desk, which looks extremly sweet, and finished that at 4 and hung with Melissa and Jordan and went to the mall. Crashed at my place.  Sunday I woke up , took a shower, went back to sleep  Monday I went to DB's last hockey game of december, and also hung with DB after, and did a few swinging stunts in. Had Davy-Boys Party also, and that was fun. Melissa brought the DDR, and Donna tried it and she failed. lol. It was really fun  Tueday I woke up really early at 6 to get a few things done on my computer, because It's been acting up, so installed a bunch of shit and re-did some stuff.  that took like 3 1/2 hours, but it worked.  Also, swang on that lovely day, and messed around with Evan for a tad.  Wednesday was New Years Eve, and they were gonna play hockey at St. Mikes but I didn't. It turned out there was an old guy trying to take Seans stick while Sean was trying to retrieve the ball. Sean called the police and they came and Sean could of pressed charges but didnt, (bastard) but it was OK.  PARTY here at my house, That I didn't know about untill the last minute, but thats okay, Evan and Sean came as well as a bunch of family.  Flash Games Galore, and PS2 galore as well (haven't played console games in months) Gazzola did his Fireworksthing and it looked awsome  Thursday (today?) went to Drews house for like the whole day and came home. There was solid swinging, and the rose bowl, (GO USC!)  played scrabble with Greg, Scott, and Scotts g/f, and then made the Mur website, which will be up soon.      But MAN, I have SO MUCH TAREA that I need to do, so no more partying and shit, I'm goin to do it tommarow no matter what, so everyone will just have to deal with it. But my vacation was actually extremly great, and I hope everyone had a great vacation!!
