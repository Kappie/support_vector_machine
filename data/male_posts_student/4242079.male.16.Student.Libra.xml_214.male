Included in the splurge was the CDs "The Used - Maybe Memories" and some CD by Shai Hulud (I'm not overly impressed by it). I also bought the movies "Hard Core Logo", "House of a 1000 Corpses", and the first and second season of the TV show "Trailer Park Boys".   I went shopping with Phaedra.  Then we returned to Red Deer with Kylie, and ventured over to Chapters, where I bought some giant book (it's friggin huge) on Vampires, and the book "Breaking Faith", by some guy...I dunno, he wrote "Hitlers Pope", as well. Then Tim Horton's then blah blah blah.  We ended up just watching movies at Phaedra's house later. I've concluded that Kylie and Phaedra surpass Shyla and Laura as the funnest people I know to hang out with. (Although not by very much at all). I had fun.  When I got home, I decided to watch the first four episodes of "Trailer Park Boys. I succeeded, and managed to go to sleep at around 5ish.   The next thing I remember, is Kiel my boss calling me. This is how I recounted the story to Mark:   yeah. my boss called at 8:30 this morning and was like "where the fuck are you, you were supposed to be here for a staff meeting, even though it's your day off". and i was like..."guhhhhfuckthatguuu" and he was like..."you're in trouble, go back to bed". and i was like...guhhhhh   So I guess i'm in a little trouble.  On the agenda for today:  Eat Fish and Chips. Watch Trailer Park Boys Find Used CD in my car somewhere. Call Manda.    It was a very blustery day yesterday, and the wind managed to strip every tree of every leave that had been holding on. I hate winter.
