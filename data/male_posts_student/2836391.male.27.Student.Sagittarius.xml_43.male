I had my post for the evening all typed up, just needed to publish it, and one of those wonderful internet errors occurs, and I lose it all! Oh well, I probably need the typing practice anyway.   In other technological issues today, I was going to take my portable CD player to be repaired, as it stopped working a while ago. I decided to give it one more try before taking it in, and lo and behold, it was working fine. I cancelled my trip to the shop, and later the same afternoon, it stopped working again. So, tomorrow, back I go to the mall, to do the job I should have done already today.     Back to the grind  Next week is back to college. This is good, because it means I get to see my classmates again, and exercise my brain again. This is also bad, as it means that I have to go back to getting up early, and means I will have to go to bed earlier than I have been over the past couple of weeks. I'm not a morning person, and never have been. I far prefer to be up late into the night and sleep late, than be up at o-dark-hundred. But, as teaching is a profession that will require me to be awake in the morning, I guess I will have to get used to it.  I often joke that I am on autopilot until about 10am. Getting up, breakfast, getting to class, all this seems to happen without conscious thought, and then around 10am I wake up. Previous coworkers, and current classmates, have commented on this phenomenon. They say I sit quite quietly in the room for the first part of the morning, and then at about 10 look around suddenly, with a wild and startled expression, and take notice of what is going on around me. For this reason I try where possible not to schedule any important meetings or decisions before "wake up time", because I will invariably make the wrong decision.
