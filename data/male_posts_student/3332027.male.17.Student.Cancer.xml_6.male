I'm just going to sit, be quiet and not care anymore. I don't want to care about so much anymore. I shouldn't be here trying to solve anybody else's crap. I'm too stressed and I don't really need it, God knows I don't get help from anyone about anything.   Fuck the caring about helping people.  Fuck the empty promises; I'm the only one who keeps there end of the deal. Fuck the "I'll Call You Back" cause no one ever does but me. Fuck the guy who use to think love is the greatest thing. Fuck the advice that no one gives back. Fuck the issues I solve and get not even a thank you in return. Fuck the way I get screwed over. Fuck the faith I once had. Fuck the sacrifices. Fuck the person who I was once; the one that thought love was worth it. Fuck the person who I was once; always taking chances. Fuck it.  The song I put, it just says, well figure it out. It say it there, I don't care anymore, I want to see how people deal without me:   MobY - The Great Escape     I'll use a lock that has no key Aren't you in chains That no one else can see  Let the water creep over your face I'll send it in waves Just to watch you perform the great escape  How long can you hold your breath While you hold mine again and wait Just to watch you perform the great escape  I'll pull your arms tight behind you back Use myself as weight And wonder while you fade  How long can you hold your breath While you hold mine again and wait Just to watch you perform the great escape    *Maybe one day I'll have faith again*
