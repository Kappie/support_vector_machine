I thought Holly had given up. *does t3h bollocks dance*  And Buxton rocked. See LJ (www.livejournal.com/users/bulldogface) for random MemeGen ("The Downfall of Your Fandom") and loooooong Buxton report.   On a sidenote, I think I've probably shat all over any chances of getting good coursework by missing four days of school. Bah.    JACK YOU SUCK *runs away quick*
