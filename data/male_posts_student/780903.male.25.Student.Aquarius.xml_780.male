I've got a 2004 Vault Guide to Law Firms that I don't need, and that no one who uses Amazon seems to want to give me $20 for.  $34.95 retail value.  And it's actually still sealed in the plastic -- I didn't realize when I bought it that we get online access through the Harvard career services website, and I ended up not even opening the paper copy.  So this is brand new, and if someone is willing to pay shipping, it's a sunk cost for me and I'm happy to give it away and make someone happy.  If you want it, here's the plan: send me an e-mail with the subject line Free Vault Guide.  I'll give it a few days, depending on the response, and I'll randomly choose one (the accounting firm of My Mom will audit the drawing, since I'll do it before I head back to school next weekend).
