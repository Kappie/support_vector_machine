Jenn made sure to let me know that i wasnt.  she's real sweet.  ha. i cant believe im sayin that about her but she really is.  we were talkin about helpin people.  she said i really have helped her...and ellyn ((though i dont know how i helped ellyn...well ok maybe i do)).  but jenn really made me feel better a little.  i was glad to help.  i do love to help people.  its like a challenge to me was how i described it to Jenn.  like one of those challenges where you want so bad to overcome it.  you are so determined to get it done.  thats how i get.  and then if i try but i cant i get all frustrated and upset.  which is how i've been lately.  i dunno...i just havent felt like i've been helpin anybody out.  i get so discouraged sometimes when i cant help.  i really shouldnt cuz sometimes there is just nothin that can be done but i have such a hard time accepting that.  i just feel like there is always somethin i can do.  and when i dont help...i feel like i just failed.  that i didnt try hard enough.  it can be really frustrating.  well whatever.  im goin to bed.  bon soir.
