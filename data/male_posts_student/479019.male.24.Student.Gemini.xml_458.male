I really don't think I'm going to get my 602 stuff done before I leave, but I want to have as large of a chunk done as possible before I go.  My 603 and 690F stuff is pretty much done and just needs a quick look over before I turn it on Monday.  My cold is significantly better today, hopefully I'll be cleared of it by Tuesday?  ***
