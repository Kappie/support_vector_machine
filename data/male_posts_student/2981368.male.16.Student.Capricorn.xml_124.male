Points of interest being:  - The incredible amount of work thats gonna be in English  History - Nat's cool glove things - Trying to play american football with 6 people - Trying to understand Mrs Lowenburg - A pink mini that drove past us while on the High Street - How insane Mr Atterton is  Yup. A pretty good day. In the end my options were (in block order): English, History, Geography, Physchology.  (Wow. Its raining so hard it looks like the road is flooding.)  Tonight (well, 7:45) England play Portugal in the quarter finals of Euro 2004...I stand by my belief that if we can effeciently man-mark Christiano Ronaldo we'll have no problems in beating them 2 or 3 nil.  (Switching between subjects here...) Tomorrow is book-takey-back day. Basically a big pointless thing where we all dump our books in the school hall. Won't that be fun.  Last few points:  - Its stopped raining now - Clocks still rules - Bishop + Jack = Unfunny jokes involving me and Nat - My toe is bleeding! - Only...5 days till the Prom...*erk* - The drag made by those England car flags is costing the country Â£19 million from extra petrol consumption - COME ON ENGLAND!
