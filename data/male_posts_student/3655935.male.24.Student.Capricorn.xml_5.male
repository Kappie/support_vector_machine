In other words, there are no real choices to be made because other causal factors have already determined their outcome.  Determinism comes in many forms.   Physicalism , a type of absolute reductionism that believes only material entities exist, is inherently deterministic, since all that exists is simply matter in motion.  The present state of matter coupled with the laws of nature ought to determine the outcome of the world.   Theological determinism , a logical consequence of five point Calvinism and Jonathan Edwards’ theology, would also qualify as deterministic.  The world is not physically determined, but according to theological determinists everything is determined solely by God’s will.  Aside from untoward pragmatic by-products of determinism, I think the biggest philosophical shortcoming for any form of determinism comes from a problem of internal coherence.  For determinists of all stripes cannot answer this dilemma: “You believe in determinism either because (a) you have been determined to do so or (b) you examined the evidence and freely drew the valid conclusion that it is true.”  Option (a) is the answer most consistent with determinism, but if one has been determined to believe in determinism, then they really don’t have good reasons to believe it.  On the other hand, if the determinists suggest option (b), then they have admitted that at least one choice is not determined by pre-existing sufficient conditions, which would be tantamount to abandoning determinism.  But there is no need for one's philosophy to get impaled on the horns of a dilemma.  Rather, I suggest that all forms of determinism should simply be dismissed as self-referentially incoherent, and you should accept some form of genuine freedom instead.  In his essay, “The Dilemma of Determinism” William James proposes the following sound advise: “our first act of freedom, if we are free, ought in all inward propriety to be to affirm that we are free.”  Or as Geddy Lee, from the band Rush puts it, “If you choose not to decide  You still have made a choice You can choose from phantom fears And kindness that can kill I will choose a path that's clear I will choose free will!”
