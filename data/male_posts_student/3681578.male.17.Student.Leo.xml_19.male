Wala lang...I'm kinda thinking of improving my blog a lot...though, I have ideas, I don't really have the time...plus the fact that I can't use Flash in this damn PC...  hehehe...I'm also worked on my writing stuff...i.e. continuing my past compositions, sketches, biographies, versions, other stuff that I do whenever I get too damn bored...  now, I'm working on poetry...yes, my dear old dreaded friend...poetry...wala lang, I'm really planning to compose a song, well, a part of the song...I'm kinda rusty about guitars na cause the little I know has sank away into the unexplored and untapped realms of my brain, deposited there with integrals, derivatives, vectors, projectiles, waves and the like on top...hehehe...  so back to composing, my hs classmate Caren and I had this sorta bargain in composing the song, she'll do the music part by adapting it on what I wrote...and if I remember, uy, we also planned on one song about ____...ok change topic [sana natatandaan mo pa yung ibig kong sabihin Caren]...  and we just had this really stupid though fun debut practice...at least, I found some new acquaintances from my cousin's (the debutante) friends...hehehe...  I just don't want to sleep yet...I've finished my paper for Gimo (I hope it goes well) and practiced a little of basic form 1 for PE...what else to do, Guidon requirements I think?! but I'm not really thinking of doing that anymore...  um, there...so basta, I'll try to get sleep na before I wake up at 3:30 to do exercises in Math, then off for a bath and I'm heading off to school for my first class in CTC...hehehe...sorry if this is just nonsense, its just that I'm so bored...   *yawn*
