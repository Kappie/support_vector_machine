There's two matches that I'd like to see, but the main event holds little interest for me, and I can keep up with the realtime results for free by reading  urlLink PWTorch .  Anyway, a lot of the card is pretty predictable, but just for shits and giggles, bear with me as I play Fantasy-Vince, and fantasy book this PPV:   Test vs. Scott Steiner:  The stipulations for this match are that if The Big Bad Booty Daddy wins, he gets Stacey Keibler's services back.  If Test wins, he gets to not only retain Stacey, but gets to make Big Poppa Pump his personal hookup.  Thus far, Steiner's run in the WWE has been a flop.  He could really benefit from having a heel run with Test.  I could see the pair having a pretty decent feud with the Dudleys in the near future.  Holla if ya hear me!   Prediction: Test wins with his arms on the ropes.    Lita  Trish vs. Molly  Gail Kim:  What really weakens the Women's division is the fact that every single one of them has at one point or another held the Women's strap.  It's time to bring Nidia or Dawn Marie over to Raw and inject  some fresh meat into the division.   I got your fresh meat to inject right here, baby!    Anyway, all horniness aside, Lita has been out of action for nearly a year and a half.  She's bound to be a tad rusty, and Gail Kim thus far is a horrible worker.  Therefore it's incumbent on Molly and Trish to carry this match, which I have no doubt they will.   Prediction: Lita wins with a Litacuranna on Gail.    Spike, Devon, and Bubba vs. La Resistance and Rob Conway in a Tables Match:  No way The Frenchies win this one.  This is going to be a pure crowd-pleasing match.  The second the bell rings, the crowd will be chanting, "WE WANT TABLES!"  I'm predicting a Dudley squash here.   Prediction:  Dudleys put all three opponents through tables and win the Tag Belts on RAW.      J.R  King vs. Al Snow  Coach:   First off, I would have never even booked this match, or the whole ridiculous angle to begin with.  This slot on the PPV could have been well served by a Hurricane/S.H.I.T vs. Mack/Henry.  Oh well...this is also a no-brainer.  My only question is, Who's going to call this match?  Stone Cold and Bischoff? (Hey, there's an idea...)  Prediction:  J.R. punks out Coach in a major way, and gets the win.    Christian vs. RVD vs. Y2J for the I-C Title:   This match is one of the one's that tempts me to buy Unforgiven at the last minute  (must...resist...urges...) .  This is also one of the most intriguing angles going in, and has the potential to carry on for a couple months into the Survivor Series, with many possibilities.  It's no secret that I'm an RVD mark.  RVD definitely deserves to look good after his long, drawn out feud with Kane.  Jericho needs to be competeing for the World Title.    I'm looking for him to be a non-factor in the finish.   Prediction:  Christian cheats to pin RVD, and they carry on a feud to Survivor Series.   Kane vs. Shane-O-Mac (Last Man Standing Match):  This is another match I'd almost pay to see.  Kane has been on a monster run as of late, but anyone who has watched WWE for the last four years knows what Shane is capable of in a match.  Look for Shane to pull off a move that makes the crowd chant "HOLY SHIT", only to see Kane "rise from the dead".  Kane has the most momentum on the RAW roster going into this match (except for maybe Jericho).  Look for Shane to vanish again.   Prediction:  Kane whips ass.    Randy Orton vs. Shawn Micheals:   I'd pay to see this one too.  ( I didn't say that!  Tell me I didn't just say that!  I am NOT BUYING THIS PPV!)   Orton has been playing up his "Legend Killer" gimmick very well, lately.  HBK has also said almost everything but "To be the MAN you gotta beat the MAN".  This has all the potential to be an awesome match.  Look for THE man (Flair) to be a factor in the outcome. Orton's performance in this match will make or break his WWE career.   Prediction:  Orton with the pin and goes onto bigger things.    Bill Goldberg vs. HHH for the Ten Pounds of Gold:   This match  should  be a no-brainer.  Trips is about to get married, and go on his honeymoon, plus he needs to rest his various injuries.  All indications are that he will drop the belt.  Stay with me here... Last Monday's RAW kept doing those "Believe the Hype" highlights on Golddust, err, Goldberg.  No question, Goldberg wins the belt, right?  Sorry, I have a different prediction.  (After all, I'm fantasy booking here, right?)  The stipulation is if Goldberg loses, he has to retire (or go to Japan).  I figure Goldberg will stick around for a few more months at least.  However, there are a couple factors to consider.  First off, WWE is not going to put the strap on a guy who refuses to work house shows.  Secondly, Trips won't job to just anyone, and in the WWE backstage hierarchy, Goldberg is just another anyone.  Still, HHH needs to drop the belt, however briefly...   Prediction:  HHH loses by DQ, therefore saving himself the title, and Goldberg gets to stick around .   I'm not done yet!  Based on my booking, tomorrow night's RAW is going to be a must see!  I peer into my crystal ball and see Stone Cold putting Trips into a title match with....KANE!!  Kane destroys the Champ (setting up an injury angle) wins the belt and gets to run with it for a couple months.  It'll be interesting to see how right or wrong I am.
