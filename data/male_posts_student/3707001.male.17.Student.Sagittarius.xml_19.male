Then after reading another heart-warming email, wc3! Wow, I got owned 3 games in a row... lol, in total I got 1 win and 4 losses. After getting fooded, I ate some leftovers and ran some ball at 11:30. There was supposed to be a huge game going, but it turned out to be a practice session for me. That's cool, I need to work my ankle back in anyways. Wow, it was so hot yesterday, and I was playing ball in the dead heat of the afternoon under the sweltering sun wit the smog alert in effect. It woulda been ok but some lil kids from some camp or something took my fountain captive!! >.  After a short convo wit a friend, I jumped in the shower. I had one of my old burned mixed cds playing. Nothing I could sing along to, but some classic jams. Shine - Hot Boys??!! Exactly... Anyways after shaving and stuff I got out at 2:20ish. Got dressed, Luckily I already decided what I was gonna wear so I was good. A lil last second colonge and I was good to go. As I left, I told my mom I was going out, and she was on the comp wit her back to me. She said ok and never turned around. Turns out she thought I was going to work... o well.   Wow, thats a long bus ride. It got longer at the Dragon Centre on Sheppard between from between Brimely and Midland to Birchmount. The bus was nice and empty till about 30 lil azn kids got on the bus. Some day camp I assume, they had some counsellors and stuff. I think one of the girls were checking me out... ò.ô. Those kids were everywhere! I was in the corner of the bus as usual, and I had put my bag on the floor to help out one more kid. Well the kid who was beside me kept on touching me and pointing at stuff outside the window while putting his arm across my face. I was quite relieved when they got off.   I arrived at Fairview at 3:55. As soon as I got to ground level, I pulled out the cellie to call Matt... no response. Ok, they're in the arcade. Walked across the mall to reach the arcade... no1s there. Ok, they're waiting for me at the theatre. Climb the escalator to the theatre... no1. I was getting really worried at this point. I'm sure they wouldnt have ditched me without giving me a phone call right?? Well 3 calls later Matt FINALLY picked up his phone. Will went to the arcade so I went to intercept him. When I found him we all met at the theatre and got our tix to "I, Robot". Wooooo... that movie was toooo good too!!!! I esp enjoyed the shower scene wit Will Smith... mmmmm... Go and see it!! Tho prolly not at the theatre in Fairview... it was kinda ghetto. lol, I didnt even know the place existed till this week. O well, I got to sit between Ada and Will, I offered to switch spots wit Will cuz I knew he'd be happier beside Ada... but he refused. No matter, the movie was good so it didnt matter where u sat, unless u were at the front, but it wasnt that packed. Like c'mon, there are better theatres (no offense to those who love it).   After the great movie and some chuckles of me playing Will in ball, we we to the Sony Store to look for a "stylus" I think its called for Ada. Radio Shack? No. Sony Store? No, but Ada did get the guy's number ;). lol, hes a lil bit older but I guess thats how she likes it... haha... uh, lets get off that. Well after that Will went to check something out and I went to the arcade to run some MvC2 as Matt and Ada went to get some food. I almost wish I went wit them, cuz I got struggled!!! I'm talking like 6 losses in a row! One of them lasted like 30 secs. Juggernaut... the guy did that gay thing where as soon as u jump he throws out the super and u cant block!! Then when my 1st char died I called out my assist and somehow they both died... not that he wasnt skilled... well... nvm. After getting shamed I met up wit the 3 in the food court. They were already done and were waiting for Jaime to give Ada her letters for her missions trip. Ooops, sorry, I didnt write one >.  Sometimes I love to be difficult. Well I excercised this wit Ada as she and Matt were criticizing my shopping habits.  A- "Shopping like that is natural... for a girl"  W- "Oh... so ur calling me feminine. Your calling me a girl, well--"  "No! that's not what Im saying. I'm just saying that socially, stereotypically, it is natural for a girl to do that"  "Wow! So I'm not only feminine but I'm weird too huh? thx Ada..."  haha... then we started yelling (well I did) and creating a scene as she stormed off in frustration. She went to Coles as Matt and I reached EB. Nothing good. Then I went to the nearby Foot Locker. Yes... 3x black golf tees. But it was wrinkled, so I didnt buy it. Returned to Coles, Ada and Will were still going wild, so Matt and I chilled on the bench. They came back out and we sat around for a bit. Will went to check out the Bell Mobility, so we waited on the bench. Apparently Matt and Ada were surprised that I wasnt shopping, so I got up and started to leave them. Ada ran after me followed by Matt and Will who happened to have just been catching up with us. I joked around wit her some more as we continued walking. Slowly Matt and I switched spots as I got the chance to catch up wit Will a lil more. Ada saw an old friend, they talked as Will andI talked during Matt's numerous laps around the block. Then some mysterious things happened and Will and I were talking again.   I must say Will, I didnt know what to expect cuz it was the first time chillin wit u but ur far cooler than I gave u credit for. I see why Matt and Ada chose u as friends, and Im honoured that I had the chance to talk with you 2. So... now u heard it from my mouth... well it seems we got a problem, well I know u know it but I dont think that you know that I know it too. Well since I found out ur such a good guy I'd rather talk to you about it than hide from it. Next time we see each other wherever... we'll talk a lil more seriously.   Tensions mounted as I got a nice tour of the outside of Fairview. I swear I've been there like 5 times in my life >. "Warren... WARREN!!!"   Thx Will... if it wasnt for youI wouldnt have gotten to accomplish what I set out to do that nite... say goodbye. You honestly dont know how much ur efforts made my day. You are a true friend to every1...   Haha, I was escorted to the bus depot and didnt escort my escort back to the subway. And you thought I was a nice guy??!!  M- "Hey Warren tell me when ur bus gets here."  W- "Uh... thats it."  M- "Oh, ok"  **"gangsta" hug**  M- "See ya later man"  W- "Ya for sure! I'll definetly see ya soon!"  M- "Uh... Im leaving for my cottage this weekend..."  W- "Oh, guess I wont be seeing you soon then >. **exchange of "later"s**   Then a convo that seemed to fly by while I waited for the bus. Bus arrived... heart-warming hug that kept me on Cloud 9 the whole way back... I'll miss you more.   I got home at 10:30 and I was exhausted. I woulda written this last nite... but them damn rentz again!! O well, thank you Matt, Will and Ada for my most memorable nite this summer.  Matt enjoy urself at ur cottage!  Ada have fun in Arizona on ur trip!  Will... uh... ya... see ya later...?  lol, I'll be praying for all of you and we gotta do this again sometime (well hopefully minus the drama)   Here's the lyrics to a song that reminds me of someone.    Carl Thomas ft. LL Cool J - She Is (remix)     (V1)  Like my favorite scene in the best movie,  like the air that I breath that's what she is to me.  Like a song I just wrote or like coming home,  when I've been gone too long that's what she doesto me.
