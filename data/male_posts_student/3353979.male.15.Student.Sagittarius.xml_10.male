Went to the park nicki,steven,nathan,brian and chris was there. Nicki and kristen have really changed over the past year, there different people, there not the same people i know. They take like as a joke and right now and my life isent a joke, they joke with there feelings and im done joking around, "life is real". Right now i'd give anything to just move far away, a new life, new friends, new everything............
