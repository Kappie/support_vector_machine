New Favorite Songs (and YES, I realize that some of these aren't exactly new!): - "Someday" - Nickelback - "Unwell" - Matchbox Twenty (I absolutely, totally associate with this song) - "Dreams" - December Son - "What I Think" - Dezaray's Hammer - "Crawling In The Dark" - Hoobastank - "Your Touch" - Kutless - "On My Way To You" - Mercy Me - "Save Yourself" - Sense Field - "Headstrong" - Trapt (just for the beat...)  New Favorite Groups: - The Benjamin Gate - Plumb - Bebo Norman (ok, so maybe I'm a little behind...) - Thousand Foot Krutch - BT - Rob Dougan, Aphex Twin, Prodigy (selectively)  There's more...I just can't think of them now...so I suppose you shall just have to wait in breathless anticipation until the next time...:-P
