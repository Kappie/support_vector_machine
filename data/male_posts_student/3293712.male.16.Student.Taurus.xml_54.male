Yeah, today Bremer shipped out, after putting some final crippling laws on the interim government. Not only do the new laws make it easy for the US to ensure that Western-friendly candidates will be elected, they leave room for heinous human rights violations. From now on, U.S. contractors are  immune  from Iraqi law while doing whatever job the government has overpaid them to do.   The Iraqi government is mainly symbolic, as we still have to enforce the peace and bear the costs.  I read in the newspaper the other day that we were in Germany and Japan for  sixty  years. Can you imagine us in this quagmire for five more years, or a decade? Sadly enough, it seems that because of the neo-cons some of my friends or acquaintances might have to go to Iraq after high school.   I was too tired from Hobe's birthday to do anything today, so I watched  Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade  and read two Stephen King novellas. Stephen King is actually quite a good writer. I won't claim to like most of his commerical stuff, but I love his short story comps and, of course, the  Dark Tower  series, one of the most epic fantasy series concieved since  Lord of the Rings . Also, it isn't your cookie-cutter elves and goblins, either. It is like a sad romance Western laced with King's commitment to seek the truth of human nature. If you haven't ever read a King book, you should. His style of writing is interesting and easy to read.    Office Space  is coming on in a few minutes. I'd better wrap this up.  The Jetpack turning seventeen was a weird event. When I first got to his house I had a "where has the time gone" moment. I mean, I knew this kid back when my mom still liked me. It also made me think about how unfair time is. Jet is seventeen, as is Hannah. One is graduated from high school, and the other still has two years to go. I've always felt mature for my age, but everyone says that I just hate everything. We did some stuff, which was fun but not really interesting enough to record here, and went to sleep rather late. Now, we had like eight people crammed down in his boathouse, and it was pure torture trying to sleep. When I went to sleep at four, I was sleeping on a futon with two other people. My feet stuck way off the end and I was miserable. Sometime during the night, I fell off the futon and was kicked in the face several times.  My teeth hurt.
