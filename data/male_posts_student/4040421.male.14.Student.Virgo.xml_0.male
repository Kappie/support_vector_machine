The only downside were the people walking around the beach like they owned the place. We'd set out our little area, just like everyone else. But every so often these people would just walk right in front of us, across our rugs and such, pulling buggies and huge bags, running over our toes. So we tried to stop them by digging a huge hole in front of where we were. It had  steep edges and most sensible people wouldn't have tried to drag all their worldly posession across it. But  still  people dragged prams, tents and bags through it. How stupid can you get? They didn't care if the hole was deep, they didn't care if they fell down trying to get across it. They were going to go through it. We just sat there and laughed silently. Clearly people weren't getting the message, so we put up surfboards, wrote GO AWAY in the sand and stood there like bouncers outside a club. And guess what? People just ran across. God I hate people sometimes.  Anyway, I couldn't find my camera so there'll be no pictues. Sorry >_
