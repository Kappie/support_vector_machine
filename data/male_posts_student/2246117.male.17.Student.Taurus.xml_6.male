I just made love with your sweet memory, One thousand times in my head. You said you loved it more than ever, You said...  You remain, turned away. Turning further everyday.  I talked for hours to your wallet photograph And you just listened. You laughed enchanted by my intellect Or maybe you didn't...  The world has turned and left me here Just where I was before you appeared. And in your place an empty space  Has filled the void behind my face.   Do you believe what I sing now?
