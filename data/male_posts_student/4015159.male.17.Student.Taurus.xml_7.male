Anyway I'm sure I'll find a way, the main thing is it's complete and therefore I must put another pound in the jar. Now I will reveal tomorrows task...          The Third Task          Tomorrow, for ONE DAY ONLY. I will hate SPIDER-MAN! If I can go all day despising the superhero then another pound will go in the jar. So my fellow homosapiens, feel free to tease me!
