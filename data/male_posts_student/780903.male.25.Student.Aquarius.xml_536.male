I wonder what it could be The guy next door snores  Look in the toilet No, look closer, look closer Ha. I made you look.  Look in the shower A rat peeking from the drain But at least he's clean  Forgot my sandals Is this really a big deal? My foot's infected  Trying to study But someone is having fun Stop having fun please  4 in the morning But it's very hard to tell They're all still awake  My alarm clock rings? No, it is my neighbor's clock But I can hear it  There are no windows The brochure did not say that They think lying's fun
