Despite some quite appalling cheating from Burton Albion's  Billy The Brewer  Alex fought off the challenge of Tamworth's  Tammy The Lamb  and Crystal Palace's  Peter The Eagle  to head the 36 strong field!  urlLink     As this was his last appearance as Alexander the Greek it was quite a way to go out!  Hopefully this will be a precursor to Conference success in the 2004/05 season. Come on you  urlLink Grecians !!!
