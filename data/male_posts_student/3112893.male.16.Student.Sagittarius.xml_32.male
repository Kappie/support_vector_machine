I have him like 3 bucks and said that I'd be at his show, but the thing is that I never got to go. I really wanted to go, but my mom was "oh her feet all day long and it was just so exhausting" and I can understand that. She's 39 years old so that might be a little difficult and she's my mom so she deserves a break every now and again. Besides, it's not really her job to drive me around from place to place.  That was a bit disappointing for me because he seemed like a nice guy and he seemed to be looking forward to me meeting him there, but ya know... Sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes the bar eats you. What's that even mean anyway? It doesn't matter. I guess the number 4 thing I need now is a way to get around the city. Back in Boston, I could walk everywhere and while there was the bus and train, I didn't really NEED to take it. But in Los Angeles, it's a whole different ball-game because I'm like 6 miles from work and there are some big fat hills that are right in the way.  Since our money's a little more than "a little tight", I can't exactly be asking for my own car. But even if I had one, I'd have to go back to Massachusetts to get a full license that I would then have to turn into a California license because of a bunch of stupid California laws aimed at making the roads "safer". I personally think it's just a way for the state to charge more processing fees than ever before, but that's just me. Anyway, aside from all the trouble and a stupid class I'd have to take, I'd have to pay a bunch of fees to both states and take a total of 4 driving/road related exams. Assuming that was taken care of though, there's no car for me to drive. We're leasing a Volkwagen Jetta and that's the only car we have. So if I were to drive, I'd need to not only buy a new car, but also pay absurdly high insurance on the car because I'm under 18. The whole situation is stupid so I'm just waiting until I'm 18 so that I can avoid most of this logistical mess.  Then there's the option of the bus pass. This one seems to work really well for my needs because I don't usually need to get around anywhere farther than a mile or two after 2AM or before 6AM and there's a bus that takes me a block away from work. I actually don't know why my parents don't get me a bus pass. For only 50-something dollars a month, I could be out of their hair ride-wise and I'd be a little more independent. I'd start to pay for the pass in a month or so because I'll be getting a job with my uncle at his Car Rental place doing things like clean, park, move, and install parts into the cars.  Hopefully that job will allow me the financial freedom to eat more than ramen and popcorn everyday. It's amazing how much two 5's, a 1, and some pocket change can get you at Ralph's and the Farmer's Market if you know how to use it. I think this poor diet business, while not effecting my weight much at all, is really getting to my internal stuff because I feel groggier and even less healthy than I usually do. I know you probably wouldn't believe this, but I used to be a star athlete. I totally raped at soccer and could run for over 4 hours straight. It feels good to look back on those days sometimes, but it makes me sad in a way, so I'll stop.  Moving on to a completely unrelated topic, I called my orthodontist this morning they said that the earliest appointment they can give me is on the afternoon of July 16th to get my braces off (Hoorah! I hate these fargin' things!), which is a bummer because I fly out there on the 2nd of July which means that I'd have to stay in Boston for at least three weeks. Now that wouldn't normally be a problem, but I have that thing called a JOB that I need to be at and my taking month-long breaks this frequently is not good for my image! Sigh. At least I'll get to spend more time at a place I like :-).  I think I've run out of things to say at the moment, but it probably wont be long until I remember something else. If you've managed to read this far, I admire you. I would have probably just skimmed it and said to myself "too long, too boring, nothing funny. I hope his next post is funnier." If you want something funny to read, you might enjoy the "random crap that's on our mind" type blog that I set up with my cousin.
