So today was okay, I had to take care of my neighbor's yard, which sucks, but the pay is great: $75 for a month of watering his grass! Amazing. So anyways, after that was all done I had Ryan over to swim, and that was fun I guess. Then I watched Bridget Jones's Diary (pretty good movie) and came up here. It's 11:30 pm and I'm tired so I'm gonna go to be now. Expect more tomorrow!
