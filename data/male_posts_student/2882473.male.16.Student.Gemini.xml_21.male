Friday after school I went to Bromley with my sister for no reason really. For some reason I decided to buy myself a dictaphone for Â£40 from Argos. Probably didn't need it, but hell, I had the money to spend. I can now leave myself little reminders without having to use all that effort of having to pick up a pen. Saturday morning I went food shopping to Sainsburys which was very uneventful. Yesterday afternoon I watched 'Life of Brian' DVD, 'twas very good, although Holy Grail was better. I also watched 'Finding Nemo' which I didn't like very much. The ending was obvious and the jokes were not funny.  Geography homework was boring, but can't complain as we rarely get any. Writing about changes in tourism patterns around the world in the latter hald of the 20th Century. Chemistry was easy, just a few questions from the text book, and maths was dull; more intergration, this time, using it to find the area under graphs. This would have been ok, if I hadn't looked in the back of the text book to find my answers to the last two questions completely wrong. And I'm not changing my answers because each question had about a page of A5 working out. But still, can't complain, although I just have... so.... Anyway. Later today I will do my German homework, which will again be boring as hell, answering questions about my homelife, which I barely understand. I mean, what the swud does 'Was wirst du zum nachsten Mal in der Stadt kafen?' mean??? And there's 17 of them!! Ohhhh :( I had better do some business homework too, although that is not so bad, as it's an ongoing thing, and I'm already ahead. Well, I'm just sitting here putting off the inevitable... GERMAN HOMEWORK... so.... can I think of anything else to say...? No? Oh well, German it is then....  ta ta for now.
