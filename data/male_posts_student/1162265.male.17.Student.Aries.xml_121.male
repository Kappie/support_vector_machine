After the second day of my job, I began to realize that straight males can't do everything women can do.  I probubly should have seen Daddy Daycare, before I decided to work the preschool.  It was seriously one of the dumber choices I made.  Firstly, I'm the only male.  Secondly, the second youngest person there is going into her Freshmen year in Highschool.  Another girl into her Sophmore, and the other three girls (I guess that'd be the term) are teachers in there mid-20's.  They can deal with this motherly changing kids clothes type of thing, and talk about colleges.  While I just sort of saunter around pretending I didn't make a bad choice.  Don't get me wrong, doing preschool has it's moments but I really don't have the femine type of skills needed to do it effectively.   But on the bright side, I have seen one advantage of this today.  One of the black kids mothers was observing the daycare to see if her son would like it yesterday and I started to talk to her a bit.  She was really nice, and I could clearly tell she was overjoyed to have a black guy working at the daycare her son would be going to.  Today when she picked up her son, she was introducing me to her husband, and telling me about her son and honestly I felt good.  I hadn't felt that needed all day at it was quite a welcome feeling.  Especially with the aura that seems to surround the other counselors when they're around me.  Sort of a  "What is he doing here?" type of Aura, which doesn't help with my "What am  I  doing here Aura. I don't know, I generally don't enjoy the things I do but I'll learn to cope.  Besides if I ever plan on having kids this can be useful.  But damn, these kids can't even go to the bathroom alone.  Let alone the fact that I can't even talk to them about the most basic things (unless I was talking about there sock colors or something).
