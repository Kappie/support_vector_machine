Days of relentless rain had swelled up the river, it's volume expanding over night, rising menacingly up the banks to wipe out much of the early summer 'greenness'. Vantaankoski pulled in the crowds. A natural phenomena to behold.  We sniggered in the morning, laughing at the trivial nature of the news; only to find ourselves at the cordoned off bridge, staring at the amazing rapidity of the river. It makes you think. What is a news worthy story? Are we genuinely interested in what happens in the Oval Office; what is said in the Commons; how many are killed in the latest bomb blast in Iraq; who is winning the presidential race for the White House?  When a river swells in the neighbourhood. It's news. It's exciting news. Do you need to know about death and power-politics. To be convinced how important powerful people are -those who make all the important decisions-, when all the while, a river thunders a profound wisdom. The staple media feed is death, suffering and fear. Happy families, successful marriages, and boisterous rivers rarely make the news. It's no coincidence that people are increasingly stressed, staring at hopeless situations; when the only wisdom they receive is filtered through the 'official channels', leaving a void without God, filling it with fear and uncertainty.  Concentrate on what is good. Contemplate goodness. For, if we believe what our eyes see, all will seem negative and life but a war.   We can stand on the bridge, looking at the water, nodding our head in approval, or stand in the crowd during the coronation, looking on the might of man, nodding our head in approval.  "So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal."
