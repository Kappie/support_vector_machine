ShuChoMouff: umm... hmm, where to begin ElizBell: LoL ShuChoMouff: :-D i love these conversations if the other person isnt trying to convert me, i just have trouble finding a starting point ShuChoMouff: and also i h8 doing em over aim, i cant express feelings thru aim like in real life ElizBell: lol haha yes i know what u mean! ShuChoMouff: hmm.... ElizBell: .. ShuChoMouff: First of all, i guess because there's no factual proof. I know, i know, the bible is real, blah blah blah, but how do you know? Just because the bible says its real? No, that can't be right. Where did it come from? ShuChoMouff: i dont believe in that blind faith stuff ShuChoMouff: doesnt work for me ElizBell: o okya ShuChoMouff: if were blind, how do we know its there? ElizBell: what about ur parents ElizBell: what do they believe in ShuChoMouff: my dad doesnt talk about it much, my mom doesnt ShuChoMouff: she used to when her parents forced her to, but when she got into college she said "wait a minute..." ElizBell: lol o. ElizBell: okay ShuChoMouff: i mean, about the blind faith thing....(gimme a sec to type) ElizBell: k ShuChoMouff: i believe that extra terestrials probably do exist, but not because of the alien signtings and crop circles and all that, thats all bull- because its improbable that somewhere in this huge universe, the same conditions wouldnt exist. The aliens may only be as far as we are, blowing eachother to hell and back with guns and violence. ShuChoMouff: its all coincidence- there is no fate, how is that probable? how is that logical? ElizBell: okay ShuChoMouff: The one thing i hate about the movie The Matrix is that it took alot of my ideas, so people keep saying i copied off that ElizBell: LoL o that sux ShuChoMouff: example "Do you believe in fate, neo?" "no." "Why not?" "because i dont like the idea that im not in control of my life" ElizBell: haha yea! ShuChoMouff: because i know that anything could change at any moment ElizBell: it can. ShuChoMouff: that i could be hit by a car, or shot in a driveby or something ShuChoMouff: and i know i wont wake up and see clouds and angels ShuChoMouff: ...or fire and brimstone... ElizBell: well hell isnt exactly that. ShuChoMouff: i think dying is probably like going to sleep, except you dont dream ShuChoMouff: yes thats true, it isnt ElizBell: hell means away from God.  ShuChoMouff: there are many visions of hell ShuChoMouff: yes, theres that ElizBell: right but  ElizBell: ..lol mk ShuChoMouff: then there are the layers and all that ElizBell: yeah ShuChoMouff: noone can agree on anything- thats another reason i know its not true ElizBell: so when u die, u think like, you will just like not wake up, and ur life is over? ElizBell: j/w ElizBell: thats how ya see it'/? ShuChoMouff: well, its been proven lately that when you think ANYTHING, a chemical is secreted into your brain ShuChoMouff: plus the electricity thing, which makes you live ElizBell: lol what does that mean?! ElizBell: WHAT ElizBell: lol ShuChoMouff: sorry, let me explain ShuChoMouff: they did some tests on some labrats about a year ago ElizBell: lol k ShuChoMouff: they taught this one rat how to run through a maza ShuChoMouff: and he got so good, he could do it in 4.3 seconds ElizBell: wow ShuChoMouff: they killed the rat, and took out his brain to examine it. (for the sake of science, lol) ElizBell: right right lol ShuChoMouff: they ended up feeding the brain to ANOTHER rat of the same species ShuChoMouff: so a rat ate another rat's brain ElizBell: uh huh ShuChoMouff: and they put that rat, who had NEVER gone through that maze before, into the maze. ShuChoMouff: you know how long it took that rat to complete the maze? ElizBell: how long ShuChoMouff: 3.5 seconds ElizBell: wow..why?! ElizBell: it was shorter..the time ShuChoMouff: the chemicals i was talking about ElizBell: yeah ShuChoMouff: turned it into instinct for the rat because its brain isnt as well developed- its not smart enough to stop that from happening ElizBell: jeez ShuChoMouff: so that makes it impossible to have a "soul" that floats to heaven, or hell, or wherever ShuChoMouff: although it would be nice to have an afterlife, it's most likely not true ElizBell: okay ElizBell: that was deep ElizBell: now my brain is tired ShuChoMouff: sorry about that, i get carried away. ShuChoMouff: lol ElizBell: So i think im gonan go ...lol its okay i enjoyed it. lol okay ill ttl tho ShuChoMouff: yes, thank you very much for letting me speak my mind :-)  I thought that was a good conversation.  Once her brain gets un-tired, lol, i hope we can continue that, i want to hear her thoughts on the matter. :-D
