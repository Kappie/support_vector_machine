First off on Monday. PE! Softball! Weee! It was so damn fun! HaHaHa! Even I scored a run for my team! Wee-hoo! Okay. There's no PE and Mass PE for mine and Gloria's class for the next two weeks. Next week all the PE teachers will be going to the Leadership Training Camp and there will be no PE lessons for the whole week. The following week is National Day holidays! Weee! Okay. Not soo wee. I am dissappointed that there will be no PE lessons. I like softball. So fun! However, I don't mind not having Mass PE next week. :P  Right. What else today? Nothing else le. Yeah. I've got choir. Today in choir we spent the whole day learning John's composition. O.O Due to some inevitable shifts, I ended up in the second row. Besides Gerald Ng. I felt so extra when not in the front row with CQ and Astro. I am so used to sitting with them le. Gerald ar...ayiah. Don't know how to say him la. See him so pitiful like that. I know how Janet feels le. I felt so left out and miserable. Anyhoo....John's song was quite nice. HaHa.   Hmm. Kelvin came over at 9+. HaHa. He wrote till 12.15. HaHaHa. Even ducks were meowing at the almost-forgotten bag. :P   Today   Oh god. I felt so sleepy today. I don't know why. I don't think it is due to lack of sleep. I always sleep at 12+, and I don't feel this tired. I think maybe I had a heavy day or something. I even slept during Chinese test leh! So embarassing. I got woken up by Mr Yeo, and apparently, he and CQ were laughing at me sleeping and shaking their heads. Meow moo!!  Right. Why I felt painful? I don't know why. My left thigh hurts for the whole day. Sigh. It still hurts now though. CQ thought I was making up some excuse not to Mass PE. No!! Its really painful.   Besides that, I developed a sharp headache during Mass PE. So painful! Now I am still having it. I think I need to sleep soon. Yeah.  Ya know what? I think I'll do it now. See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!
