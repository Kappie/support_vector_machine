The TV Pro is supposed to be a film teacher primarily so that is really good...

He starts mouthing the words of the chorus in the song, but hes not singing, hes just yelling them at her (This part may be cut for something else due to the fact that i dont want the viewers to get the impression that I am singing.) After third "Now" she jumps on him, and starts hugging him. He smiles coyly into the camera while saying the last few nows. Undecided last few seconds.  Dashboard Confessional Bend and not Break  I pedal up these steps now Decisive and intentioned Precise a pattern specifically to yours I'm talented at breathing Especially exhaling So that my chest will rise and fall with yours  I'm careful not to wake you Fearing conversation It's better just to hold you And keep you pacified I'm talented with reason I cover all the angles I can fail before I ever try  Try to understand there's an old mistake that fools will make And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away Wont you hold me now (I will not bend I will not break) Wont you hold me now (I will not bend I will not break)  I am feeling agile I can bend and not break But I can break and take it with a smile And I am so resilient I recover quickly I'll convince you soon that I am fine  Try to understand there's and old mistake that fools will make And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away Wont you hold me now (I will not bend I will not break) Wont you hold me now  Just hold me close to you, just hold me close to you Just hold me close to you, just hold me close to you, to you  And try to understand there's and old mistake that fools will make And I'm the king of them, pushing everything that's good away So wont you hold me now? Wont you hold me now? Now, now, now, now, now
