So read the little blurb  A priest, a minister, and a rabbi were discussing what they would like people to say after they died and their bodies were on display in open caskets. Priest: “I would like someone to say ‘He was a righteous and honest man and very generous.’” Minister: “I would like someone to say ‘He was very kind and fair, and he was very good to his parishioners.’” Rabbi: “I would want someone to say ‘Oh, look! He’s moving!’”  HAHAHA I'm so wierd slash bored and I just watched hidalgo...Then onto hellboy BWAHAHAH
