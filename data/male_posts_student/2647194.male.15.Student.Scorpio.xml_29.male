My dad and grandpa bowled, I shot pool, pretty fun.  Now its 12:00 midnight, I'm updating my blog for the first time in 2 days (you're welcome, Amanda...lol), and I'm tired as hell.  Along with "Anything for Excitement", I now have yet another project on my table, "Jesus Mobile", a more Christian-based song. Lyrics by Amanda, orchestration (if I ever get around to it) done by me. That's 2 now, so I've got some work to do, erm, today. lol. Plus that english outline. I wish everyone would be gone tommorow so I can compose in peace, but nooo! My dad HAS to have the day off...plus the pianos aren't exactly secluded...  Hmm...what did I do today: worked on the numerous bikes on my porch to prepare them for picking (my grandparents wanted a few). In the process of attempting to pump up my own bike's rear tire, I blew the valve. Dammit. Now there's another thing I need to fix. PLUS, we don't have a good fricking quality floor pump for presta valves. grrr! AND the rear wheel on my rental Orbea needs truing, AND 2 spokes need replacing on my white Trek's front wheel. PLUS my Specialized Sport bike computer broke today, so that's done for. I'm ordering 2 wireless computers for 25 each, and that's half off. 1 for the Trek, 1 for the Orbea. Hopefully I'll get these bikes in genuine working fashion soon enough. The season isn't too far off...  What I didn't do today: practice piano and drums (*gasp*), spend a ton of time on AIM, like I usually do, or do any homework whatsoever.  What I did do today: update my blog (duh...)  Well, I believe its time for me to check out and heed my own closing time.  "Closing time Open all the doors and let you out into the world Closing time Turn all of the lights on over every boy and every girl Closing time One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey or beer Closing time You don't have to go home but you can't stay here   I know who I want to take me home I know who I want to take me home I know who I want to take me home  Closing time Time for you to go out to the places you will be from Closing time This room won't be open till your brothers or your sisters come So gather up your jackets, move it to the exits I hope you have found a friend Closing time Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end  I know who I want to take me home I know who I want to take me home I know who I want to take me home Take me home"
