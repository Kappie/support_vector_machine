Chris Carmack Eric Hayashi Chris Lowe Donovan Parks Mark Pontin (MIA, but forgiven due to being a new father) Patrick Vincenti Jimmy 'X' Rueben Angie Bowers Lisa Bury (DNP due to cracked ribs) Tassy Davidson Pamela Liversidge  The final proved to be a hard fought game with players struggling to be competitive while still playing within the spirit of the game.  A few questionable calls by both teams in the first few points set the tone though both teams managed to settle themselves down by the later stages of the game.  We trailed the entire game and things were looking bleak with a score of 12-8 and momentum clearly not on our side.  With the daylight fading there was a real fear the game would be called due to lack of light.  Wendi came to our aid and determined that the final needed to be resolved by a complete game to 17.    This seemingly small event dramatically shifted the momentum of the game.  With the score at 16-15 we were only 2 points away from pulling off a spectacular comeback victory.  A turn over deep in our end led to a poetic set of throws allowing me to place an easy toss in the end zone for Angie.  It was a 0-0 game to one!  What better way to end it than a brilliant hammer toss from Chris C to our MVP Jimmy X.  Nuggets win 17-16!    Amazing season – heaps of fun, great competition, and learned a ton about the game (thanks Dave P.)!   MVPs:  Jimmy ‘X’ Rueben and Tassy Davidson
