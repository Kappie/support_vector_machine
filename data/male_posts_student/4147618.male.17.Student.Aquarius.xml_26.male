Here are the steps that needs to be followed to be able to post on here.  1) You will receive an email from "Blogger Invites" (hotmail users, make sure to check ur junk mail folders, since hotmail tends to put blogger emails in junk/spam folder)  2) You will have a link in that email.  Click on that link and accept the invitation.  3) Create a new account with blogger (button should be on the lower left corner)  4) Choose whatever username and password you desire. However, be aware, that the "Display Name" is what is going to show up when you post; so choose a nice simple name.  5) with the above created username and password, log in to your account (through www.blogger.com) and click on the "Special Delivery For Sami  Dharmesh" blog.  6) Be aware that there are people from BOTH sides of the family, and not everyone knows everyone. Your first post would best be kept to introduction.  7) DO NOT...I repeat DO NOT reply to the emails that you get whose reply to address is "riamadhu@googlegroups.com". This is setup so that everyone in the group can get an email when someone makes a new post. If you are not getting this email, or if you would like to STOP getting these emails; email me at the above address and let me know.  8) If you have allready registered and you DO NOT see your name under the contributors list on the right side...something is wrong :-) Update your profile with some information and then see if it shows up, if not.. contact me.  Any other questions, email me at the above address.  Take Care folks, and will update soon with more pictures.
