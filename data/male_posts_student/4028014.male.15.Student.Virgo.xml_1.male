But you know what happen to me right? I'm too busy this days and it just slip off my mind... Really really sorry girl...  Today was quite ok... No irritating people giving comments and all sorts... Most of the lesson i've been building castle in the air... Doing nothing and shut my brain down... Die... I've not been listening to Mr Koh's lesson for the past few weeks already... Oh man...   Hmm... Bascially nothing much to comment on... Just feel that i am very quiet today ba... Or the other way round??? Beats me... Hmm... That Jeremy... Keep disturbing me while we are on the way home... Really want to beat him up man... Kept staring at me for no eason when i am trying to fall asleep... Tomorrow he will get it!!! Got to revenge!!! Urgh!!!  Well... that's all i have to say... Mimi... When are you going to do my tag board for me??? Sigh... Got to go... Tata!!! Good day!!!
