I got on my bike and went down to the Subway which is about a block away (which is weird because almost everything in this town is a block from my house). Anyway I walked in and had to wait about 15 minutes because some damn soccer team just happened to pick the subway I was going to instead of the hundred other restaurants available. After that I ordered my usual turkey sandwich, with cucumbers, lettuce, green peppers, and American cheese. Everything was fine (except for the soccer team making me wait). So I sit down to eat and on the radio was this horrible country song. I mean I have heard some bad ones before but this one takes the cake. It was called "Rough and Ready" by some guy (wasnt really paying attention to who made this embarrassment to music). I thought, who would play country music on their own will? Then I remember the 55 year old lady who made my sandwich. It would make sense that she would turn this crap on because I remember her calling me "Hun" and she sounded as if she smoked a lot. I can't even believe I sat through the entire thing without killing someone. You can always tell who the manager is because they have control over the radio. In this case I was saddened to find out that the manager liked country music.
