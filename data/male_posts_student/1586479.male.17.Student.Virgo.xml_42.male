I believe in freedom. I believe in supporting beliefs, no matter how unbelievable they are. I believe in acoustic guitars and electric basses. And hip-hop drums. I believe that music can change a heart and lift a soul. I believe in eternal families. I believe that aliens are out there and the whacks on the street foretelling the end of the world are right. The world is ending. I believe that. I believe that only I can prevent forest fires. I believe in many gods, but I worship God. I believe that friends can be more dear to each other than they are to their own right hands. I believe in many things. I believe that God has a sense of humor, and that He exercises it daily. And yes, I believe God is a man. No, I don’t believe that sexism is right. No, I don’t believe saying God is a man is being sexist. He just is. I don’t believe that makes men any better or women any worse; I believe we are equal in God’s eyes (physically). I believe in waffles, and all their fluffy goodness. I believe in government conspiracies (or at least corrupt postal workers). I believe in immortality, and that everybody will reach it some day. I believe in color changing t-shirts, and that the people that wear them are crazy. I believe that choosy moms choose Jif. I believe in 5 different colors of pasta. I believe in the physical expression of love, and that it should not be frowned upon by anybody towards anybody anywhere anytime. I believe that my vote counts and that I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I believe in 2 foot long sausages (don’t ask). I believe I can fly. I believe I can touch the sky. I believe in an ever-expanding Universe. I believe in an infinite number of Universe-es. I believe that mankind ( or womankind, or humankind) is smaller than just a pimple on a pimple on a pimple on the ass of a giant who is small for his age compared to the other giants that make up the Universe, but I believe that if we all jump at once we can move that giant and thus the others. I believe what I am trying to say is that I believe that as insignificant as we humans are that if we work together we can change the cosmic course of events that started however many hundreds of billions of years ago. I believe in rambling sentences, and that everyone should use them. I believe in believing in something so strongly (or loving something so much) that you’d be willing to die for it. I believe in 31 individual flavors of ice cream. I believe in social activists and corporate shits. I also believe in corporate heroes. I believe in writing and its therapeutic properties and its way of getting one’s ideas out there and its openness to all. I believe that the RIAA can shove it unless they pay the artists more than they pay their CEO’s. I don’t believe in copyrights, but I do believe in giving credit to people for their brainchildren. I believe that one day a basket of wheat will be worth more than a basket of gold. I believe in the end of days, the apocalypse, Armageddon. I believe in happy endings, but I believe that things have to get bad before they get better. I believe that the media is eating away US citizen’s constitutional rights without opposition and without the US citizens even noticing. I don’t believe in proofreading this (but I will anyway). I believe I’ve said everything here exactly as I meant it to be said. I believe in video games. I believe that even geeks can come out on top: win the battle, get the girl (or guy), live happily ever after. I believe in fighting for your rights, your liberty, your freedom, and your beliefs. I also believe in not discriminating others’ beliefs, but if that’s your belief then well…that’s a paradox. A pair-of-docks. I believe in alchemy and magic and other shit that should not be messed with, but is cool to make movies and books about. I believe that everyone has something eternal in him or her or it that has always been around and always will be. And now, I believe I am done writing.
