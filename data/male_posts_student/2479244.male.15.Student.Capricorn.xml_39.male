I got in my new car shiny glossy from new clean got it from the repo place took it from a cocaine queen.  But this was not important at least when I bought this car, I was surprised to have noticed that I did not get too far.  The coppers pulled me over and said "Pop your trunk, young lad." Their eyes grew the size of planets when they saw what twas I had.  The cop got in the back and said "Drive this car, young boy!" I put my foot on the pedal but did not expect the joy  Of when next we would stop  at a fancy Motel Eight, The copper could not stand it more he did not want to wait.  He went out and bought a hoe she was a fine young lass, until the cop decided  to sniff cocaine from her ass.  So I ran out the door  and to my shiny blue mobile, I dismissed what I had saw there's no way it could be real.  I will continue this story when I have the time. Until then, stay away from cops looking for your cocaine.
