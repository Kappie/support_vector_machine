This, to me, at least makes sense, and it might betray a little bit of uncertainty by Red Sox brass regarding Trot Nixon's back (of course, the same could be said about the Angels and how they feel about Vladimir Guerrero's back).  If the Sox could sign him, he's an upgrade over just about every back-up OF (don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of Kapler, Millar, and Daubach, but defensively?) they have, and if Nixon goes down for the longterm, his defense is more than adequate.  Plus, batting him sixth or seventh in the Sox lineup, either behind or between Ortiz and Varitek, assuming that Nomar returns to the 4th spot and Manny heads to the 3rd, as the Sox intended during spring training)  could do wonders for his offensive production.
