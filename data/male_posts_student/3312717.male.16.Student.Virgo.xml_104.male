That is about... 60-80 dollars. Then, there are my speakers and my amp... That is about 400 bucks thrown away. Another 150 for install, yup... Also today, Mattson calls me and asks for a ride from Chris' house. So, I oblige and take time to go pick them up. What do they do? They leave their trash all over my car. Then, when I throw it out, Chris fucking throws his god damn pop all over my car. Last time Chris ever gets a ride anywhere in my car. Also, Mattson, you say that people can't judge your "punkness." So, don't turn around and judge in turn.
