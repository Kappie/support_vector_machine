Cg is growing tremendously, and it has been a time when a lot of things and inner emotions are dealt with and sorted out. I came to see that it is really very often that in time of pressure and stress that you will get to see the best (and worst) of people. Hummm... it has been a time of reflection..  Gotta add more onto this blog soon! My home computer is down, and that is why I have not been seen on icq and msn for some time already...
