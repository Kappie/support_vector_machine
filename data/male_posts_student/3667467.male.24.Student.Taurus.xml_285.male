I didn't know what time the class started, but I knew I was late, and I was trying to find the professor's phone number and tell him I wouldn't make it in time but I didn't know where it was. That and I had a cut on my finger that needed a bandage. Then I woke up and remembered I don't have classes anymore, that it was noon, and I didn't have anywhere to be. So I guess it ended well. I found a cut on my finger, though.
