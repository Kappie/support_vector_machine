In fact it has become such a universal trush that it might as well have been predicted by Nostradamus. In the 80s, Madonna sang about being one. These days, virtually everyone is one.   From a philosophical context, materialism deems physical metter as the only ultimate reality. From a fashionista perspective, it refers to an irresistible and irrepressible urge to own things that have zero affordability points. From a relationship context, it simply reads: gold-digger.   I recently had dinner with a bunch of friends from high school, most of whom I hadn't seen or shared a real conversationwith in a while. Much to my astonishment, one of them is dating a guy 13 years her senior. I'm not against dating older men. I'm actually a firm believer in the "age/height/weight doesn't matter" aphorism of love. I am, however, against her dating him for "practical" reasons. Translation: He's filthy rich and can buy her everything her materialistic little heart desires--and more. I was flabbergasted! After the cat returned my tongue, I was able to digest her remark. I asked if she loved him. Her blase response? No, but I think i can learn to.   The worst part of it was half the table actually agreed with her. She explained that she couldn't possibly be with someone who--gasp!--couldn't afford to buy her expensive jewelry or take her on fancy trips abroad. I honestly felt, at that moment, that she and some of my friends had crossed from being shallow to being much, much worse.   I can't help but wonder, is that what she dreamed of when she was little? Is this what she waited for all her life?   I'll admit, I'm a material boy myself. I can be often found oohing and aahing at the fingerprint-free glass counter of Rustan's. I love my Neiman Marcus sweater to distraction and I'm often found prowling the mall. I cannot live without expensive restos to match my swanky tastebuds. I must religiously slather on a ludicrously expensive night cream, if only to ensure that I will indeed get my beauty sleep every night. I dream of someday owning a private yacht that I can sail to my own tropical island. I buy stuff I don't need regardless of wether or not my mom's credit card is already maxed out--all this to satiate my insatiable materialistic urges.   But I don't and won't choose my partner based on the size of their bank account. I refuse to stoop to that level of superficiality. Even I, with my Neiman Marcus sweater and night cream, have my limits. I will crawl down the isle covered in grease and clad in tattered clothing to marry the man I love. And although I admit its nice to be with a man who can buy me the world, If he can't, I'd love him just the same.   The truth is, I know in my heart that while I am still something sans the material extravagances, without love, I am nothing. The smug gratification from the purchase of a Neiman Marcus sweater could never compare to the divine ecstasy felt from the miracle of a first kiss. The fulfillment these pricey indulgences give is about as fleeting as the moment the last dollop of night cream is consumed, but the fulfillment of finding your one true love ensures a lifetime and beyond. Love is something that never runs out, loses worth, or goes out of style. It is something that gives you that indescribably tingly, happy, heavenly feeling that no amount of money can buy. It does not come in a fancy box, a classy bottle, or a glitzy platinum setting like all the other imperfect tangible treasures. Rather, love is packaged as it is, devoid of a price tag, as the most perfect intangible treasure in this world.   I will love for love, and marry for love. In an age where material girls and boys are a dime a dozen, I choose to be an Immaterial boy.
