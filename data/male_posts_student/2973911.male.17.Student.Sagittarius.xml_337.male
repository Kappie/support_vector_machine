I thought it was bojac_007, then I tried jed, then x_omacra to no avail --- But holy guacamole, when  a beautiful girl accidentally bumped me, thats when I remembered my blogger username! Isn't that terrific?! I wonder what the alternative situations would be if a homo bumped in to me... Hmmmmm.... Anyways, whats cookin'?
