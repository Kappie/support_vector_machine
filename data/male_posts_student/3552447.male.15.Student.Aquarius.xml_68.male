"to memorial gate"ishness indeed..... me had remembered such a place....from a very long time ago.....ishness....me dadish person (who is...like in the bein of an expert forest walker....er...atleast in the woods me am in the wanderin in at leastishness...lol....^^;....).....was in the takin me and trigun when we were just about in our eleventh year of lifeishness....er somethin like that indeed.....so....me figured me wouldnt be quite as lost if me travelled the way to memorial gateishness indeed..... so me changed me course onto the path that is in the leadin to memorial gateishness....^_^ many time passings later....me reached the end of the pathishness.....mowom....it was the longest thingy me had ever been on.....oo......phew.....me reached memorial gateishness!!!!....heheh. which according to the little thingy.....is in the bein to the dedicated to john hitchcock.....from long ago...who used to be caretaker of the woodish place......which is called...the hitchcock woods.......about two-thousandish acre thingys of...er...forestish stuffs...indeed...oo;...... so it was in the comin to pass....that me realized how close me had come to the other sideishness of the woods.....(from the south side....to the north side.....which was where me was gonna be in the arrivin quite soonishness indeed....^^......;....)....but in order to complete the journey to the other side of the forestishness....me had to go down the one and only path that was in the leadin to itishness....... the devils backbone.... me thought the name was kinda wierdishness.... later me knew for sure there was nothin strange about it at all.....twasnt even that long of a ..er.....backboneish thingy indeed ^^;....and after me reached its end...me ended up....at the most northern point of the woodish place indeed...... this is where.....me was in the realizin...the fact that me was still in the needin to get to the homeish place..... me was fadin physicallyishness.....me had pushed meself more than me thought me would be in the doin soishness indeed.....^^;...... so me sat down...and rested for a few beings of time called minuteishnesses....... me poor companion was in the exhaustedishness.....(dont worry.....he is in the makin it backishness....er..along with me as ye can be in the noticin indeed...from me er....ramblingishnesses....indeed....^^;....)......... around this bein of time...me was in the seein....that the sun...(me was not in the possessin of a time teller.....indeedishness...--;....)....had sunken from two hours past noon to..er....alot laterishness....oo;.... this is about the timeishness this one was in the settin off from me restin spot..... and came to the gatewayishness....into the woodishes place....^^;.... me chose the path of the gate thingy.......(me was tryin to find a quicker way back to the homeish place...than the way me was in the wanderin to the gateish thingy indeed ^^;...ishnessess....).....and....to make this long tale short..... me had a re-encounter with the sandish river thingy....(me has not been in the tellin peoples about that thingy......)....but twas kinda like the dangerous bog thingy....just without a danger sign...indeed ^^;.....but......the thingy is....that it turns into quicksand after rainishness....but otherwise...tis like a desertishness..... me was in the walkin down such a thingy....for time's sake....(me knew that it was in the leadin close to the homeish place indeed ^_^)......but.....me then discovered...somethin life threateningishness.... about a half of a distance thingy called a mile down the sand river.....there was a spot....where the water had not been absorbed into the sandishness....me was in the seein this....when me dog was in the steppin on itishness....oo;....me remembered from me encounter with the dangerous bogish place....the behavior of quick sand.....indeed...but me dog need not fear the stuffs...do to his weight on more than two legishnesses thingy...indeed....but....despite me learning of the quicksandish stuffs...me told meself me was too far down from where me was in the beinishness....so me felt with me grandish staff thingy....(has saved me life....er...literally...many a timeishnesses.....oo;....)....and stepped out onto a different part of the cursed sand stuffs.....and took another step...then anotherishness....then another....and then anotherishness...then....ploop!......OO!.....mowom!.....me feet......but....fortunately....me steps.....were....er.....lol....indeed.....and me grabbed onto the fallen tree...(which are extremely common in bogish places...lolishness...^^;...)....and pulled meself out...indeed.....besides.....twas only me feet...heheh. so me ended up findin a place higher up by following the trunk of the treeishnessess....and went back to the dryish part of the sand river...and ran........ twas then me was in the officially tellin meself...that me was in the fadinishness hmmmishness.....this is personishness that is named bryce keeps a botherin meishness.... "ahola that means hello" thats all he is ever in the doinishness to this one...make fun of the ways of a wanderer....indeed.........he keeps a sayin "ahola that means hello" and then signs off and says that alot and then says some..er.....thingys....and then is in the signin off againishness... o wellz... anyway...indeedishness....^^;... the point is....me was in the makin it backishness! heheh. lol.... twas kinda lateishness...and me parents started to be in the worryin.....but....all was wellishness and the moral of the story is.... mow! indeed see ye!
