I was gonna give my class schedule to the scheduling manager at McD's so that she doesn't schedule me while I'm supposed to be in class. that's when I realized that I accidentally registered for two classes that start and end at almost the same time on two days!!!! I almost crapped my pants! so when she sent me on my half hour break I drove home as fast as I could and switched a couple of classes around... luckily I'm still not on any waiting lists. *phew* crisis averted! yay for me and my watchful eye. 8-)  but now I'm bored and there's no one home and there's nothing to do... maybe i'll play spiderman some more... or ocarina of time... I've only beaten that game about 30 times... *sigh* it sucks not having a life! some people may look at me and say... hey he looks like he's on easystreet he's got nothing to do... well that's only half true... i have a lot of stuff to do I just choose not to do it! :P
