That shouldn't be too hard if I stick a bunch of charts into the paper. My paper is going to be so lame. Quantative analysis is so not my thing... the less I do in grad school the better!   Things to do today:  Eat.  Work on my paper.  Maybe watch one of my bro's pirated movies.  Eat more.  Work on my paper more.  Sounds like a plan! I'm gonna get going on it now!  Oh yea... in rotation recently has been  Ten Foot Pole , which I'm not going to see in a few weeks. Damn saving money!  ***
