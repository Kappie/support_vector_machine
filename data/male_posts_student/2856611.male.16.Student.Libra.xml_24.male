Man I've been so tired lately, never in my life been so tired. Only two exams left! Wahey! Man thats cool, I was kind of expecting them to go on for  alot longer but they havn't. Thats odd. Meh so anyway Barney is on TV, I've always wondered what would happen if Barney lashed out at that green dinosaur - Baby Bop. Like on todays episode she was eating all of the apples without asking now personally I'd scream at her "What the FUCK Bop?! You can just take a brothers apples!" Elmo was on before Barney, Elmo, now theres a kid with alot of bottled up emotions. Anyway my Welsh exam went better than I thought, like my teacher - Miss. Partridge spent two years  trying  to explain to me - just look for similar words. Thank god I partially pay attention in lessons ey? After the exam me, Xav, Nick, Mahaze and Ben went down to the part to where we played on the swings and this rocking horse/dog. Nick and Xav did a tandum swing which was cool, Nick sat on the swing and then Xav sat on his shoulders which was really cool. Then Mahaze tried to get on top of the frame so as he went up we stole his shoes and threw them at him. Then Xav ran off with one... hehe climbed to the other side of the river, whilst Mahaze was looking for Xav I took his bad and joined Xav then we found a tire, can't remember what happened to that. Oh and Ben tried to throw Mahazes bag to me over the river and it landed in it, that was funny. RE exam, woaho no! Yeah screwed up on it, partially cause of little or no revision and partly due to the controversial questions. One of them was "Are Men and Women equal?" and although I quickly placed my views on how they are I then launched into a full attack on the Catholic church having ago at them for being sexist which is totally true so turns out God is Gay. Yesterday I spent the day with Charli which was great cause I havn't done that in ages, we tried to find our way to the Bay but couldn't find a way... maybe next time. We then went to Ster and saw Mean Girls and may I say Lindsay Lohan IS the sex. Shes so hot, I mean she was hot in Freaky Friday but there was a whole new level of hot in Mean Girls, anyway after that me and Charli hanged out in the park and started wrestling, hehe I beat her twice and she only beat me once! Then we had to go home so blah that sucked, hopefully my wish'll come true and I'll see her again VERY soon. Today Mr. Greenhow is coming by for the LAST time, definetly this time, and he's going to go over a bit of Physics for me, then no more getting up early on Sundays, and you can quote me on that! CHILI'S ON WEDENSDAY! My brother went to their Hyde Park show yesterday, got home VERY late or should I say early? but still managed to get up for work so good on him, hopefully he'll give me all the details, Anyhow I'm off, later children on the sex.
