Everyone has a purpose in life not decided by themselves. While for 95% that purpose is to find the right person, settle down, have a family, and relish in the greatest joys of being human, there are those for whom that is not their purpose. They have a different purpose, not greater nor lesser, and not at all clear. These people will never find love because it is not meant for them. These people will never settle down, because what drives them is the need to fulfill their purpose. It's likely the these people won't have the fortune of growing old and living out their days, for once their purpose is fulfilled, there is no need for them.   I honestly feel like I'm one of those people. I don't feel a real, true urge to find a significant other, but there's definately something missing. Something that I'm here for... I've always tried to push it away by beLIEving that we determined our own purpose. That's a pleasant idea, but it's not the case. I'm here for a reason. There's someething I'm supposed to do, or witness, or be, and it's not to just settle down and enjoy a family.   Or maybe I'm just afraid of commitment...
