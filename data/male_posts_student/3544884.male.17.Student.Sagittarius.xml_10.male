But it was not because she had a cold. “I have been silly,” she said to him at last, “I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy…” He was surprised by this absence of reproached. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness. “Of course I love you the flower said to him. “It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you- you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy… Let the glass globe be. I don’t want it any more.” “But the wind -” “My cold is not so bad as all that… The cool night air will do me good. I am a flower.” “But the animals-” “Well I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems to me that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies- and the caterpillars- who will call upon me? You will be far away…As for the large animals- I am not at all afraid of them. I have my claws.” And, naively, she showed her four thorns. Then she added: “Don’t linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!” For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower. -The Little Prince Antoine de Saint Exupery
