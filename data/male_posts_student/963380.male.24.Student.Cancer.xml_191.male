Not my mom and dad, they're relatively normal; I speak of the second cousins, the great aunts and uncles, the general malais of folks who are somehow connected to me through some dubious genetic link. I don't see them very often; this is not a problem for me. In every city there is a distinct  right  and  wrong  side of the tracks. I'm not sure if they just had bad luck or if they were drawn to the most depressing part of town (dubbed, appropriately, de-Preston) but they've really nailed the po' white trash thing nicely.   It is interesting that they make some effort to "clean up" for family events - including, but not limited to, anniversaries, funerals, birthdays, christenings and the occasional "Congratulations on your recent Parole" party. This generally implies that all of the men will display their Irish heritage by dressing in dark slacks, white dress shirts and trimming their sideburns. There is an almost uniform appearance to these men: they are short with receding hairlines (curly hair, like Hobbits!), collars unbuttoned so as to intimate some shred of Elvis-like Presle-nacity, and one hand in a pocket while the other one (no Alanis jokes please) gestures wildly in front of them - this uncontrollable hand gesticulation is a distinct feature developed over time by the weighting of one hand, generally with a beer. Sans beer the limb is like a rabid animal. I say all of them men, but I should clarify - these are the blood relations. The relations by marriage, in the male persuasion, are all overly tall, overweight men with moustaches, mullets and pedophile glasses. They have no sense of dignity nor of the appropriate nature of behaviour in relation to the function you're attending. As an example par excellencé I will refer to yesterday's viewing wherein one of these sub-humans had the audacity to comment on the decedents promiscuous nature (four husbands) and mentioning that he would have "hit that" had the opportunity had presented itself. We nearly had a second funeral on our hands - the only thing that prevented it was the inability between my father and I in being able to decide who got to off the jackass.  The women aren't much better. There's a scene in the musical "The Music Man" where a group of ladies perform a song in which their actions compare them to barnyard fowl. It is much the same at family gatherings with the notable exceptions that there is no melody, veritably no humour and the song generally goes on for about three hours.  I needn't mention the young. They make me want to cut my eyes out in shame. Who wears a miniskirt and then doffs their shoes in a funeral home?  I told you this was going to take a while.    The funeral home was the same one in which Rob T was prepared. It was hard to see the room where I'd seen him last. It felt physically heavy to walk through there; smiling funerary employees do their best to put a gentle spin on the process - I have difficulty buying it.  I miss Rob T.   I think I need to shift gears at this point because the morbidity is really chewing at me here. I got my City of Heroes comic in the mail today - interesting. I hope I'm in it someday.  I've started using Windowblinds a little more - and I picked up Desktop X and Object Dock again - they seem to be less buggy this time. You can try them out at  urlLink Stardock.com   I tried out Futureshops new online music service. It crashed.  I'm loving the new camera. I have to start working on Chad's wedding video.  In fact, I'll do that right now.
