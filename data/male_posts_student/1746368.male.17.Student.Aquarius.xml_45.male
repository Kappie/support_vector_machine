For right now, I can only tell you that God has been working some big things in my life, and it's time for a change. The friends I normally hang out will hopefully understand. I have decided to do something with my faith. This is very exciting for me, but it may not be to other people, especially people who read this and do not go to Livermore High, which I think nobody goes to Livermore who reads this, with the exception of Kris and Sara, but I don't think they read this often. Tomorrow I hope to get my plan started, but I don't know how it is going to go. Anybody who can, please be praying for me. Pastor Mike said God would work through us this year, and so far, at least with me, he's right. I hope I can look to any of my readers for support.  Anyways, the "Site o' the day" is games.com. This is the place where I sometimes play pretty cool games. They have Scrabble, and that's a pretty cool game. I am going to go read for a little while now. I finished the second book and I am about a quarter of the way through the third book. Very good series, Left Behind is. I highly recommend it to everybody. It is purely speculation, so don't take it at face value. Remember: Nobody knows what is going to happen at the end times, and if anybody does, you might want to slap them a couple of times, or show them their wrong. *NOTE * I do not really think that you should slap them, I think it wouldn't do much help, just tell them that only the Antichrist would say something like that. That should stop them dead in their tracks.
