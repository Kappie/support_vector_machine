He's got his own practice and a real recording studio in his basement. He's got one of the best pair of ears around and his musical mind is fan-tas-tic! From the way he spoke, I could tell that he knew a lot... as in one of the best in his field, yet he was so humble. Truly a good role model.  I got pointer from him and he took down my contact to pass to his circle. I've listed them in non-chronological order. 1) Always be humble 2) Get as much exposure I can 3) Know what genre suits my voice 4) Know what my range of notes is 5) Thoughts about my permanent occupation vs my Secondary occupation 6) Have talent and be good at what you do 7) Get good at guitar 8) Know basic music theory 9) Remember that what you have is a gift from God, so everything goes back to him. Hurt and Glory. Questions and praise.  I will use these as a checklist. Also, the music might help to take my mind off her. I'm not sure if that's what I want, but I'm leaving it to God. For the next few days, I'll be asking the BIG MAN about what he wants me to do. If what I want is not the answer, I will accept his will. I will be devastated, but I will accept. Sidney told me that if I banked totally on becoming a recording artist, in the event I didn't get it, I'd be totally devastated. I know, but then again, I've been devastated time after time that it's ridiculous and I'm numb.  Got dissed by Tiff today. Was terribly upset that she didn't have the courtesy to tell me that I wasn't to be called for Iskandar's recording auditions. Whatever lah. Numb remember?  Just had a civilized conversation with Hazel. Semi-civilized anyway. Second best part of my day!
