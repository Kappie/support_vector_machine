I stayed a bit, talked to a few people I worked with, it was nice..good food too! Afterwards Valerie and I went driving around town, went down to the south pier and just walked around and talked about pushing people in the water, haha...hm..good time. Anyways, not much else going on, I have work tomorrow 10a-4p so that'll take a bit of my morning up, hopefully this time I'll catch the right bus, eh? Well I'm out..I'm thirsty..
