The whole thing was so much fun, and staying in the youth hostel was great to; clean, cheap and full of nice people. We met this Irish guy (we named him Paddy O'Brian) who was staying in the Youth Hostel whilst he brought an apartment in Paris, he managed to eat a whole massive jar of gerkins while we sat there playing cards and then came over and started talikng so we invited him to play cards. He came up with this game (wich is the same as black jack) which it seemed he made up the rules as we went along. "ahhya can honly place dhat card on hay tuesday if hits bin raining and hits a coloured card". Oh and simon and Tom managed to snap the key card for our room into the lock within five minutes of getting to our room and so we had to get the cool guy with the long hair to fix it. the second day we saw all the sites and had a laugh. anyway must go i really need to start packing, oh and blogger has had a re vamp so you can now post pictures and don't have to use HTML codeing to do basic things.
