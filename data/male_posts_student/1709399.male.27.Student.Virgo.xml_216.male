We Conducted a Blood Donation camp at our office yesterday and more than 250 employees donated blood. As Chairman of the Social Services Committee at my workplace , it was a wonderful learning experience for me in planning  executing such an event.                                                   People fascinate me .I had the unique opportunity of interacting from very close quarters with my Team members,employees of my organization,Senior Management in my company,Doctors  Nurses from the Hospitals and office-bearers from Rotary Club ( we conducted the event in association with Rotary-Noida) . Over the years I have realized the ultimate winners are those who know how to jell with people .People management is an art. Gained some valuable insights on the above.
