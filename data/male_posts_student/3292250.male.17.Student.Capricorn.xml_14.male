Her flight to Chicago for her  urlLink dissertation defense  was delayed, then canceled, so she had to take a flight the next day. Not fun. Then yesterday her flight to Chicago (again, this time connecting to KC) was delayed, then canceled. The wonderfully (un) helpful airport people thought it would be fun to put her on a Delta flight to Cincinnati that would connect to Kansas City's Mid Continental Airport. Well, I know to avoid Delta like the plague, since the only airline I've had the best time with is United. Long story short, she made it to KC today just fine. Yes, today. They wouldn't hold the connection flight for even 10 minutes, and so she was suck in Cincinnati for 12 hours at the skanky Cincinnati airport.  I seem to be blogging more lately. This is good. Now I just need to actually get out and do something. But I've got no money, and Gap calls to me like, well, it just calls for me to buy some new jeans, pants, and shirts. It could be the fact that the vast majority of cute guys who work at the mall work there, but I think it's more the couture.
