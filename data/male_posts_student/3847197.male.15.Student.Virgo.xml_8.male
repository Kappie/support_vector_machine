Please leave me another and maybe a name/contact this time?  Thanks in advance.  Anyhow, we're moving over there to Deer Run.  Good stuff.  I like the house, although it's not the best.  It's good for our income and shit.  So yeh, anyways... That's about it.  Nothing is really going on.  Just enjoying the summer.  Going to reclaim my learners Monday !! lol  And I think...  That is all.
