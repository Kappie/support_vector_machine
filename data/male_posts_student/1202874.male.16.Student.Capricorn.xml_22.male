"no liz that's alright." on top of that her tone led me to think it was half sarcastic. fast forward... i ended up going over her house. xfest kept coming up and i was just like i wish we would of gone. she agrees but then was reminded me of how her mom could of gotten us down there. dammit doug sometimes you're just an ass. loosely using "sometimes" in that last sentence... then today in 10th period study hall marcus and brenna are telling hilarious stories about people trying to crowd surf (you've seen it before people, where people jump and everyone else holds them up and moves them around. it was in the our lady peace video). and staind has some slower music and the crowd was just kinda like 'yea if you jump i'm not gonna catch you for these songs'. some people attempted to defy them. as they jumped and they then landed on the ground, the crowd was like 'yea i told you. you didn't believe me but i was serious.' some of these stories were hilarious. one of the kids from our school was in the mosh pit. still wearing her glasses (what are you thinkin??) gets completely elbowed in the mouth and end up crawling on the ground in search of her glasses. could we not have seen this coming? yeah i saw it coming too... well another decision about laziness is being made.   righttt................. now
