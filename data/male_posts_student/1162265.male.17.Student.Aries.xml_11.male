Yesterday, I went to my Aunts school (McKinney Place) to help here with her Grade K class, it was pretty fun, but most of those kids are really, really stupid. I don't even think some of those kids were even self aware, and it was really grinding away at my aunts, and many of the other teachers sanity.  I don't blame them, it only made me further want to be an Elementry school teacher though, not enough males (especially African-American males) teach the lower grades and as J. Kunjufu noted that is a serious problem.     I've gotten into some Reggea recently, and even found a good group for Swahili rap called  Kalamashaka, even though I've only heard one of their songs "Tafsiri hii" (Explain this), which is their most popular song, and I guess it kind of reflects a different mood in Africa.  Where rappers here, who are conscious talk about racial problems, these guys talk about government problems and stuff.  They said some verse like " (forget the word) hapana(no)! Polisi.... Hapana!" It's pretty cool.  And then Beenie Man and Bounty Killah, best Dancehall reggea I've heard in ages, it gives me new respect for dancehall.
