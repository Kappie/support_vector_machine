Remember how disappointed you were when they scrapped that idea in favor of the cel-shaded look? Not to say that Wind Waker wasn't a good game, but I know I held onto that hope that a sequel to Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask would be made.  Nintendo has answered our prayers.  E3 held many surprises this year, but none of them stirred so much commotion as the unveiling of a new Zelda game that has been kept absolutely secret until now. The game trailer that was shown featured a new adult Link, done in the style of Ocarina of Time, riding, shooting, fighting...   The graphics looks absolutely amazing. Link has NEVER looked better. I have watched the trailer several times now, and it still gives me the chills. This game looks so amazing, I'm willing to bet money on it... that is, if I had any money.   I will defenitely be keeping an eye on this game. And I will most defenitely keep you updated on it. To watch the trailer, head over to www.gamespot.com. You will not be disappointed.
