You think that I never poured any of my time for this.  It never works, does it?  Everything I've tried hard to accomplish, everything I do, you just throw it away like it was just trash.  It's never good enough for you.  You want me to be something that I could never be,someone that is perfect.  Don't you understand that in the end, all that I can do and all that I am will always be that way...  Just ME!  Why can't you understand that or see with your own goddamn eyes that I could never be the one you want me to be.  Why can't your stupid fucked-up mind ever perceive that?  I'm not you, I'm not someone who you want me to be, I'm me...  ME, Fucker!  What do I have to do to make you understand that?  I've tried my best the whole time and it doesn't seem to get through your thick head about what I 'm trying to show, God damn you!  If you are truly the perfect person that you make me believe you are, how come your smart mind cannot grasp the fact that I could never be the one you want me to be?  Can't you see that I've been trying to impress you all along?  For once in your fucking perfect life, appreciate what I've done that has been good and great, I know that I've created a lot of mistakes but I have been trying to atone for all of that, I'm sorry for the wrongs that I've done, I'm sorry for not being able to be a perfect son, I'm sorry if I'm not one of the greatest friends, but can't you just love me without any attached ends?  I feel so sick of being almost like your goddamn puppet, your bitch, that I just want to die.  I don't want to live anymore with you being so constricting on me, I no longer feel free.  I no longer feel that I am important in this world.  I want to live but not when I feel that I have chains dangling all over me.  Please, Lord, if you're up there, take my life away, relieve me of this misery you call "Life."
