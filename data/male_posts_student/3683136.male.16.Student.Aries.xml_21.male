The carnage that the storm left 6 inches on the ground. the south side of chicago, stands eerily so sound.  I looked up at your window, hand out as if to touch you, you used to be so perfect, how did I ever need you?  Lucky Boys Confusion - South Union  This song is so short, but the lyrics are really beautiful, and so is the melody.  It's one of the few break up songs from this perspective.  Not really angry or sad, but kind of happily reflective.  This was a pointless post. -Mike
