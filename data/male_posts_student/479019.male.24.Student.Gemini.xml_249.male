I just did some chatting and listened to NPR instead. Did some chatting with some internet folk that I haven't chatted with in a while. That was kind of cool. Man... I have 19 hrs until my first class. That's just lovely.  I've been listening to a lot of  Face to Face  lately. So that's what is rotation right now.  ***
