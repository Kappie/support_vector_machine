Ghost Poopie  The kind where you feel the Poopie come out, but there's no poopie in the toilet.    Clean Poopie  The kind where you poopie it out, see it in the toilet, but there is nothing on the toilet paper.    Wet Poopie  The kind where you wipe your butt fifty times and it still feels unwiped, so you have to put some toilet paper between your butt and your underwear so you don't runie them with a stain.    Second Wave Poopie  The kind that happens when you're done poopie-ing and you've pulled your pants up to your knees, and you realize you have to poopie some more.    Turtle Poopie  The kind of poopie that pops out a little and goes back in a few times before it finallly comes out    Pop-a-Vein-in-your-Forehead-Poopie  The kind where you strain so much to get it out, you practically have a stroke.    Lincoln Log Poopie  The kind of Poopie that is so huge you're afraid to flush without first breaking it into little pieces with the plunger.    Gas-sy Poopie  The kind where it's so noisy, everyone within earshot is giggling!    Drinker Poopie  The kind of Poopie you have the morning after a long night of drinking. It's most noticeable trait is the skid marks on the bottom of the toilet.    Corn Poopie  (Self explanatory)    Gee-I-Wish-I-Could-Poop Poopie  The kind where you want to Poopie, but all you do is it on the toilet and fart a few times.    Spinal Tap Poopie  That's the kind when it hurts so badly coming out, you swear it was leaving you sideways.    Wet Cheeks Poopie (aka The Power Dump)  The kind that comes out of your butt so fast, your butt cheeks get spashed with water.    Liquid Poopie  The kind where yellowish-brown liquid shoots you of your butt and spashes all over the toilet bowl.    Mexican Poopie  The kind that smells so bad your nose burns.    Upper Class Poopie  The kind of Poopie that doesn't smell.    The Suprise Poopie  You are not even at the toilet, because you are sure you are about to fart, but, OOPS---a Poopie!    The Dangling Poopie  This Poopie refuses to drop into the toilet even though you know you are done poopie-ing. You just pray that a shake or two will cut it loose.   Fisherman's Bobber Poopie   You are in a public restroom with two people waiting on your stall, you poopie and flush two times, but several golfball pieces are still floating above the water line.
