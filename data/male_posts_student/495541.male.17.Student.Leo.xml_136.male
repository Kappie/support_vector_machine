I either don't get it, or have a really dry sense of humor.  I think it's just a dumb joke.. but that's just me.  Anyways school continues to suck.  Nothing new really.  Just more homework and more boring stuff I'll end up forgetting in 5 years.  I think we need school reform.  I like my idea of 10 years of school, then special education based on what job you plan on focusing on.  I think that makes more sense, becuase the I think the average person does only a few things that has anything to do with their high school education.  Everything else they just forget and ends up being useless.  That's not so true the higher up you go in the job fields, but for the average person I think I'm correct.  The horrible part is that people just look to see that you've completed X schools and gotten X education.  They really don't care if you're a dumbass.  Just as long as you have X education under your belt.  It sucks, I think... but I have no room to speak.  Blah blah blah blah.  School sucks.  I wish I could learn to like it.. but it just sucks.  It gets me so stressed out about everything.  Sometimes it just makes me want to sleep for a week and just detach myself from society.  That's just how stressed I get!  ... and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that way.  Oh well.  I guess I have to live with that.  No sense in complaining if it doesn't do anything.  I'm just like blah blah blah blah.  Wow.  I'm done.  I have nothing more to say.  Tomorrow is Friday and Saturday I get to drive.  Woo, I can't wait.  Then Saturday practice and I get my hair cut.  Then fun playing Nintendo at Whits.  I can't wait to play old Mario.  Wow, what a classic game.  Peace homie.
