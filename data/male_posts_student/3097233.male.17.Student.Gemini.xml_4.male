As of right now let me tell you how I stand, from the eyes of somebody that were to look at me on paper:      What is on the Paper:  What this means to people:    6'3‚Äù:  Damn, he is tall    Junior in High School  Old enough to have a job but why should we give him a job that takes more brains than 'Would you like to biggie size that?' ?    Computer Trained and Learned  Wow, a nerd. Maybe he could work as the assistant burger flipper even!     Single  Yup, plenty of time to work as burger flipper, and confirms nerd.     Heard the 'But I want to still be friends' line once too many times  Ahh! So he has had a girlfriend before! Well damn, maybe not a full on nerd then!    Wouldn't mind a simple walk in the forest or minute alone to enjoy simplicity.  Where the hell did this guy come from?!     Borne in Walnut Creek, California. Lived 2 years in Concord, California. Moved to GP, Oregon at age 2 and living there until present date due to asthma  Holy crap.... Not only does he sound like a nerd but he has a damn disease too! And he lives in Oregon... That explains a lot too....       Well there is me on paper... and in the eyes of the reader... I think I'll do some more of those, they are kind of fun... and I get to make fun of things, mainly myself, but hell at least I get it said because, WAIT!, it is probably all true!
