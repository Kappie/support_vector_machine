Right - here is the deal. But i might have to take it slowly coz i dont quite understand it.   Maybe a year and a half ago i was at a party at Jamie's house. It was fun. Anywayz, there was this guy there called David...gothy...bisexual, apparently. I wasnt attracted to him that much, but he was a friend of Kit's and she asked me to get off with him, so i did what i usually do. I gave it out to anyone who wanted it. It was okay, but not brilliant, and he did tell me afterwards that i had "sorta a large mouth", which was nice. I stormed off insulted.  Later Kit told me he was being suggestive.  Still that was the end of that. Or so i thought.  The other night Daniel told me about his only other ex-boyfriend. I shat myself. He described a guy that could have been gothy-David (i didnt know much about him), mentioning that this David lived in East Kilbride. I dismissed it anywayz.  Until today. I bumped into Erin (and by "bumped into" i mean "she came on MSN Messenger"), and we were all talky and stuff, just about random shit. And i asked her, just out of a little curiosity if she remembered gothy-David, and she did. In fact, she replied by asking "You mean the one from East Kilbride?"  AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!! NOOOOO!!!!!   I got off with my love-interest's EX-BOYFRIEND (while i think they were still seeing each other, coz David had mentioned he was seeing someone who wasnt too happy with him at the time)!!!! HOW FUCKING CREEPY IS THAT?!?!?!  As Erin said "Small World"  And as i sed "Large mouths"    God forgive me for what im about to do, for it is the gayest thing ever. I shall now sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full of rhye. Four and twenty blackbirds, baked in a ---okay im done.   Yeah here it is, especially for Claire. Won't ever be the same with you gone.  Though we will mourn, thank you for the strength to carry on. We believe in you, and we will always love you.    Some say love: it is a river The drowns the tender reed.  Some say love: it is a razor That leaves your soul to bleed.  Some say love: it is a hunger An endless, aching need.  I say love it is a flower And you, its only seed.     Its the heart, afraid of breaking That never learns to dance.  Its the dream, afraid of waking That never takes the chance.  Its the one who wont be taken Who cannot seem to give.  And the soul, afraid of dying That never learns to live.     When the night has been too lonely And the road has been too long When you think that love is only For the lucky and the strong  Just remember in the winter Far beneath the bitter snows Lies the seed that with the sun's love In the spring becomes the rose.      Goodbye darling.   Isn't it time to fly?
