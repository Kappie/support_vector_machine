Here's a hint--it deals with the return of certain monarchial figures to their rightful place.  Yup, that's right-- Return of the King !  It was all I could do to not go ahead and watch it last night after I got it.  The only thing that really stopped me was having to wake up early this morning to come in to work.  But it'll probably get watched sometime this week, I can almost guarantee it.  And if nothing else, Jess, Dom, Beth, and I are planning a  Lord of the Rings  marathon for sometime this weekend (probably Monday, Memorial Day, actually) with the first two Extended Editions and the regular version of  Return of the King , since that's all we have of the third one so far.  But just think--isn't it nice to see a sci-fi/fantasy triology that actually lives up to expectations and does not disappoint like a couple of others I could mention?  Kudos, Peter Jackson.  Kudos.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Cake, "Long Line of Cars"
