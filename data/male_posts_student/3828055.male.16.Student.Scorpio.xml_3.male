You and 12 teammates have to come up with: an original, unique device based on a theme; a working prototype, and a model of the final device if at all possible; a corporate website to go along with this device; a complete business plan approximately 20-30 pages in length; and a full marketing plan and strategy. Oh, I should mention something: you have a little over a week to do this, working on it only 1 or 2 hours a day.   That is the very essence of the DE Project. What does DE stand for? No one knows. Some speculate "Disaster and Emergency," as per this year's theme of Diaster and Emergency Preparedness. Others believe it stands for "Design and Engineering." Personally, I think it's an acronym for "Die, Everybody!" That's the way it  feels , anyhow.   I suppose the purpose is to emulate the business world, where timelines mean money and deadlines mean jobs. There the stress is real. Here's it's all a fantasy - an elaborate and highly complex fantasy - but a fantasy nonetheless. Still, the stress here is real in its own way: we know that the end results won't  really  matter, but our desire to please and our drive to succeed supercede reality. I've taken the advice my Uncle Ray gave me before I came here to heart: like to win, win, and win early.  I'm tired. Anyhow, off to bed now.  Tata from Carleton, - Cary
