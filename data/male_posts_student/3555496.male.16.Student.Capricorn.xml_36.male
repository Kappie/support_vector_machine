If I was raising somebody else's kid for 17 years and I found out it wasn't mine... I'd kick some ass. And wtf is up with his hair? It's like part mohawk, but not part mohawk. It's stupid looking and it pisses me off every episode.    I should probably try to leave band out of my blogs but this really pissed me off today. We were marching in our block today and when I was going backwards 8 counts, I ran into Mr. Jones' dumbass. He goes, " You're too close to Irvin, Tim. " and I'm like whatever. But as I was finishing the last 4 counts, I took a look at Mr. Jones and realized he was mega fat. I think I was marching okay and the only reason I hit him was because he's so damn fat.    So today Alan came over. We were the only two people that didn't know we were being let out early at noon. Yesterday when they made the announcement I was too busy messing around in the uniform room... But anyway we headed back to my casa, ate some pizza(s), chicken, steak, ribs, noodles, etc. I didn't even know they still showed  urlLink Trigger Happy TV  anymore, but lo and behold it was on. I really missed that show.     I took my pops to the grocery store because my mom  absolutely  had to have some taco shells. It was horrible, a national crisis. A world without taco shells is chaos. My mom has this bad habit of needing one thing, but adding many other things to the grocery list. It was supposed to be an "In and Out" trip, so me and my dad decided to go. We keeps it real.    And that's how my day went. How was yours?
