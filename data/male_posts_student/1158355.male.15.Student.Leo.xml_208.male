Hung out during the day watching Matrix Revolutions special features, Revolutions actual movie during the night and stayed up till 4. I woke up at 9 and Chris woke up at 12. I got no sleep. I went to Guitar Center and bought some sticks, bass drum pads and A COWBELL! I know how awesome is that. I played some drums with the cowbell it sounded so cool. I'm really tired. Bye.
