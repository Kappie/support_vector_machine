Good with business. You'd be good as a stock broker, physicist, mathematician, scientist or professor. You value stability and material security, but aren't likely to be greedy. You're pretty much set in your ways and can be stubborn. You are extremely reliable and stable. People like you because you can be counted on. You tend to be pragmatic and favor solutions/principles that have already been established rather than ideas that haven't had their day in court. You're also way to sexy for your own good. Steve, you sexy sexy bitch.              urlLink Quiz  created by  urlLink Polly Snodgrass .        Not much happening, either. I'm in a fucking great mood today, so I guess that's what's happening. It doesn't happen often enough for it to be ignored. I downloaded a whole bunch of songs today. Lots by Jethro Tull. Anyone who has the means, I highly suggest burning a Jethro Tull cd. (or buying one, although they're uber old) Well, that's pretty much it.  Adios,  -Steve
