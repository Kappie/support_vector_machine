I'm not really on a romantic comedy thing, it's just that those were some divx movies that my brother had downloaded. 50 First Dates was pretty funny though... Along Came Polly not so much.   Strange how the leaving for work part feels like such a chore, but once I'm there it's cool. I just sort of feel tired when I get home from standing for 6 hrs and pouring / brewing coffee. My fingers smell like coffee still...  Lots of old school punk bands are playing this month  X ,  TSOL ,  DI ,  The Adolescents ,  The Dickies ,  Bad Religion , etc. I really hope I can catch these shows.  A link that's been making rounds on the internet is this thing on bringing back the  urlLink draft . I think it's a fucking scary thing that will affect millions of young men and women in this country if our governments foreign policy doesn't change. Regardless of who wins or loses the election in November, we're stuck dealing with Iraq and Afghanistan. I remember when I first read reports last year about how the American military is spread pretty thin because we have military bases all over the world, and on battleships, and in submarines. It's not surprising that there are people trying to bring it back.  I've been saying for a long time that Iraq isn't just about oil. It's about American foreign policy and military strategy. Having military bases over there with a ready supply of oil is undoubtedly a very useful thing in case anything goes awry in the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe.  Alot of things bother me about the government right now.  ***
