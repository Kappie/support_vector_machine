Lesbian: I think that vibrators will replace men's genitalia one day. Friend: That is a phallacy! *Friend hits Lesbian with a large dildo.*  I know that made no sense at all, but I was very pleased with it.  You should all proceed to this site henceforth:  urlLink The Ill Will Press . Gotta love the squirrels. Especially that schizo one with the glasses. (Watch the Kevorkian scarf.)  What one would say if the blog were not to public... Cheers.
