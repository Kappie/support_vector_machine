There are more for those brave few wishing to enter the more deprived aspects of human nature, and these can be found on the blog of the funky Mr T (see link at side). I would like to point out now that the rather suggestive pose struck by moi in one of Gordon's photos is entirely coincidental, and that I was merely tightening my belt. Honest.     urlLink    Not the eyes, not the eyes...    Thanks for reading                                  Stay Beautiful                                                          Davus
