You know what I really need to do (Other than shower; I haven't done that today)? Summer reading. I promised myself I would start in August, and now I'm having that 'Maybe I shouldn't procrastinate' thought. Goddamn procrastination. I mean, I finished Tuesday with Morrie already; it took me two hours. The Odyssey is a little harder, but not much. The translation is very easy. The problem is that I have to do work with The Odyssey.   Random Fact: Only one person in 2 billion will live to 116 or older.   Then, there's the '.Scene' problem. I really liked setting my life up as a movie/play/show/porno, but I've been forgetting to do '.Scene.' Maybe I should stop. Naa, nevermind. I've actually decided to implement more headers when I get a chance.   There's nothing here!   six hours later...  Well, I'm back. The day ended how it started: boring. I miss my friends from school, and it doesn't help I haven't talked to Bri in about two weeks, and I haven't talked to Laura since school ended. :(. I did talk to the ever-amusing Kristin today though. Time to screw around a bit.  .Music   Sugarcult - Crying  Yellowcard - Way Away  Sugarcult - Memory (Acoustic)
