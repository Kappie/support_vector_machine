They're all fantastic.  there must be something in the water because 4 women in the last 24hrs have complimented my looks - so either they're desperate or they're genuine and think i'm hot *confused look* well i'm not gonna argue - just makes me feel better.  Going to rileys soon - should be a laugh. i actually need to live in leigh - it takes me forever to get anywhere.  still havnt got my summer planned yet...i suppose you could say i'm planning to be spontaneous!
