I'll keep the little jokes to myself, since I have already changed a lot, why not change that, too?  Heh heh.  I *heart* talking to you.  Just don't scare me with that mismatch stuff.  Opposites attract, right?  Buuuuut before I go overboard into my completely odd feelings, I'll describe my current situation.  Well, I'm stripped to my boxer-briefs at the moment, doing a wash, overclocking my gfx card.  Typical nerd stuff since I've got the day free.  I don't know, maybe I'll boot up some Neverwinter Nights?  Sounds like a plan.  Haha, stripped.  You know I woke up 3 or so times this morning, at 10, 12, and 1 and then at 1 I got up and made a huge freaking tortilla and egg and cheese heart attack lunch.    I've been takin' it easy since.  I'm wondering about holding off on shaving till tuesday for obvious reasons.   Hmmm  hmmmmm dunno dunno, I eagerly await that day, since it feels like whatever I'm doing when I'm without is unimportant and boring.  gaaaaaaaaahh its seems like I'm some sort of clingy person.  In a way I am.  Later.
