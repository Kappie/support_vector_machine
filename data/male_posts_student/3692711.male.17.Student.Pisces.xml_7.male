So are my family members.... all wake up at the same time. With excitement, I changed into the black polo expedition tee and a pair of jeans... Haha, 3.30am.... i give each and every member from L3 a morning call, quite happy to hear their wakened and clear voice =p. Then at 4am, without further a do, i bring down all my luaggages down to a nearby bus stop and wait for Eugene's father's car to pick me up... my family members wait for me also.  It's early in the morning, there's hardly any people on the streets, and there are so many taxis drive past us, starring at us, the drivers are hopping to get their first or last trip for the dae. Then, Eugene's father finally come, and happily hop into the car. Wanchoo is inside oso, me and her is sitting at the back seats.   Without realising, we actually reached Changi airport. Well, my family also reached the airport at the same time as us. *Well, plus me, there will be 5 people in total, so cannot squeeze into a taxi, so the remaining 4 of my family take a taxi while i take Eugene's father's car. Well, after much waiting, finally, we get to check in. I bide farewell to my family as they see me entering into the departure hall.... and soon, my flights start...  Haha, this is not my first time taking a plane, but not that much too though. And I've got the window seat! Wahaha, wanchoo, who is having her first flight in her entire life wanna take the window seat but... hehehe, im evil... only let her sit during the return trip *well, nite time nicer what, see the lights of Singapore from the top, very damn nice, so is give her the previledge already =p Haha, and we sorta run into a small turbulance while we are having our "breakfast" in the plane and it is so fun man~~ imagine u cant aim the food into your mouth properly. And i heard that someone saw their water float into the air and drop back into their cups... haha. "Weee~, on Royal Brunei airplane!" urlLink     urlLink     Soon, we arrived Brunei. Though we dont really visit Brunei, we are stepping on Brunei's ground!! haha. Then, very soon, we have our transit and reached Kota Kinabalu. =)  We are recieved by a lady... hmmm... i have forgotten what is her name... and are transported to our lodging place, "City Park Inn". It's some kind of motel + hotel like that. My room number is 302, if I am not wrong and share my room with Kenneth, Clarence and Leonard. The room is like... OMG! But, it is affordable and comfortable. Too bad that the toilet cant be flushed....  After checking in and all that stuff, we went to a shopping center to have our lunch there. On our way there, there are lots of roads to cross. Maybe, as Singaporeans, we are used to wait for the traffic lights, I feel as though Im an alien who have landed on another planet... The people there just cant be bothered with the traffic lights... and as we walk in groups is like... "wow"...  In the shopping center, well, same old thing, lotta people stare at us as though like we are alien againz... but nevertheless, we still go for our lunch as usual. I dont know if the people there are very "sociable" or what, as we walk pass any store, there will be someone trying to pull you into their shop and eat. However, we (WenRong, Wei'jie', ZiJian, Eugene, Wanchoo and me) stop by a hot plate shop. I ordered a cup of Teh Tarik and a plate of sweet and sour chicken rice... yum yum~~ After we have gathered, we go to a supermarket and buy our groceries =) and headed back to the City park Inn.  All of us meet again and head towards the Central Library for a small racing game. We are splitted into two groups, I am in Mr Charles Goh's grp =) The game is something like navigation game, where we have to go to the station and take photos there to make sure that we have really been there etc... We start off with a very fast pace, then we slowed down after reaching a memorial kind of stand on the way to our first station. we slowed down cos Mr Goh mention this, "  I want you to learn something while having fun. It doesnt matter if we win or lose  ." We are like "...oh okae..." And yes, thru this game, we indeed have fun and learnt alot of things. For example, the people sell the rice in per kilograms basis while back in Singapore, such practice is no longer be found. The funny thing is, when we head back to the finishing point, few of my grp mates saw the other grp is reaching also and hinted us, so we run all the way there. The other grp saw us reaching also, they also rush, too bad, we are faster... However, the point is, we learnt something throughout this so called game. Haha, and we are all  good at navigating  now =p  After that, we go to the Handicraft center where we can find lots of handicrafts there. Then, we are given time to shop there... The items are kind of repeated in the other shops and diff shop owners offer diff prices... you can see the big diff one. And you really can bargain to get a better price... haha and that's how we (Eugene, Wanchoo and I) did... by buying alot at the same time and slash the price down =p But something happened, Meiling and Shafi failed to meet us on time... that makes all of us really worry for them... we are told to find them, thank god, we found them (they are still in the shops). However, we sensed thunderstorm is approaching... Mr Ng started to rumble Shafi and Meiling... though not really scold. And that teaches us that  if we cant meet the time given, at least inform the person who gave the time to meet...   Then, we start to walk down the street to this WaterBay Esplanade. Cool man!! nice scenery (nice sunset and sea!!) We have our dinner there. Though it's quite expensive, ven at where we have it, it's worth it lah. "Haha, a cafe @ the WaterBay Esplanade!" urlLink     urlLink     Then, we headed back to the same shopping center where we have our lunch to buy what ever we want to buy. It's quite boring here, cos' it's like I have nothing to buy and there is not much things for us to see also. So, after walking for some time, Wanchoo, Eugene and me find a place to sit down while waiting for the time to pass. After we gathered, we headed back to the City Park Inn...  Here comes the farnie part. Kenneth and Clarence get to bathe first and when they bathe half way, the water supply stopped. It's like "... what the..." Then i go down to the reception counterand ask for help.... Ms Lim is there too, she ias like "haha" -.-" then that person went to our room to check. When he comes to check, everything is fine, then he went off. So, i enter the toilet without any worry, but.... it's my turn that when I bathe half way, the water stopped running... I am like... then Clarence they all laugh like mad in the room! I have no choice, but to bathe with cold water from the tap. After bathing, then we get to know it's cos due to the water pressure.... not high enough... and i get to know that it is not our room only... my my room most jialat (serious) one.  Then, we go to the roof for a debrief... it's so damn beautiful... so many stars in the sky. Wahaha, the teachers praised us for being very very very  efficient  ! kaka. After that, we go back to our respective rooms and have an early night....
