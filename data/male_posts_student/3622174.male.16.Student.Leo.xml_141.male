Well, next Friday (my birthday), is the one year anniversary of that blog first starting.  So, I'm thinking, maybe I'll start posting the posts from back then.  They were badly written, and they were most of the time stupid (yes, even more stupid than 3/4 of the stuff you see here on Blog of Bagel), but, still... they were funny, if you like stupid things.  So, in honor of my forgotten birthday last year, I'll be posting things from the old blog into Blog of Bagel.  But, enough about that.  Some may be wondering what's been happening to certain features like Late Night Bloggin'.  I'll still do it, but, once a week.  And that once a week will be on Saturdays, since I try to go to bed earlier on school nights.  Provided that The River still stands after these hurricane things go past us, then, I'll have it this weekend, but, don't be surprised if I don't, because I may not have any power because of these stupid things.  Damn weather.   Well, one person has backed off, and its not the person that should be backing off right about now.  He didn't do anything to really hurt me like those two girls did today.  They'd better back off soon, though, or else, they're not going to like me at all.  I will become the nastiest person if I must, and I don't really want to resort to that.  Well, since I'm really tired, I'm out for the night.  I'll be back tomorrow afternoon with some stuff.  Bye now!
