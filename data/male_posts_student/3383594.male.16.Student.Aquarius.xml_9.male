The day started wif one and a half hours of Chinese tuition. *Sigh* haha, den my Maths  Science tutor was supposed to come, but he fell sick and couldn't. So, I was slacking and basically doing nothing.   Den in the afternoon, after my lunch, I went to earn some money. Yea! The gambling way. Haha, I was there till like 12:00am+, nearly the whole day. And I did earn some money, not alot though. So I guess I'll be giving somebody a treat today? Hehe, I wonder who would be tt special someone.   L0L, this is my shortest blog entry so far man, from the longest to the shortest. It juz realli wasn't much happening yesterday, didn't receive any disturbing phone calls. Haha, alrite I guess I'll stop here, I'll be back later to write today's entry. Cya around~ =]
