Mandy is still on my hit list, it's all planned out. That bitch is gonna be crying when I'm done with her.  And 2. I have decided i will go to stillettos with you reza, good news??? Ohhh I think not... U said you have a month to a month and a half before your return to the strip club, MUCH more than enough time for me to save up the $200 for the UBER SPECIAL V.V.I.P. room. I will be calling in before i go, and I will make sure Krya's there and in a great mood. It'll be bad enough u thinking about me with her for the 30 minutes, but then when i come out ill make sure i throw the B.J. condom down on the table in front of you, or better yet i could use that in my plan for mandy somehow.... Hmmmm, good idea Andrew.  BTW Bryan, Nice quote bio-dome is one of my fav movies ever, I have it too. I think it would be an awesome one for a [SMUT] viewing we should figure that out sometime. Toodles Reza ;)  -i||eGiTiMiT_SoN_oF-GOD-
