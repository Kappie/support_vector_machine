Verse 2:  It's morning, The day is calling. I'm empty, And loveless. Can't take back what I said. There are so many doubts in my head.  Chorus:  Lately its not hard to find, memories you left behind. For that ten thousand years I have been look for love that was true. Lately I've lost you.  Bridge:  Looking around, Trying to count, People I need. I found out, Beyond a shadow of doubt, There's only one I couldn't live without!  REPEAT CHORUS 2X  Close:  Lately, I found I, I'm breaking.
