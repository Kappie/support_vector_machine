I'm guessing that some time i'll be reducing the amount of time i write in this due to work (if i am) and other things like if i go out, which is likely.  You wouldn't believe how glad i am that first aids over. I had a bit of a lie in today without worrying or caring about going in. Its started to kick in now at how pissed off i am that i havent passed it, and i am a little disappointed that i havent, but it cant be helped.    Anyway, moving on...    I've decided that i might have a small party this year for my birthday, and have an even bigger one next year for my 18th. Yes you guessed it i'm not 17 at the moment, but i will be in August. At times like this i wish i was a couple of months older, but then what would i blame my stupidity on? Anyway, i'd keep in my good books if you wanna come, and maybe you could grow up a bit if you act like you just came home from nursery. I'm gonna try and make this a great night for all.    I'm trying to come up with things i can do during the holidays. So far i've came up with.....nothing! But theres a couple of days left till the hols start officially.    Actually i could start making my cartoon if i get a programme to do it with. That would more or less take up most of the holiday because i can work fully on it and put in more detail. Also one day i'm gonna need voices for the characters so if you think you might be suitable to do a voice for either a great dane/rottweiler type dog called Rocky, or a green cat with a diamond in its stomach called Bullet then let me know that your interested. The reason for this is i'm gonna try and enter it into this film festival next year and hopefully i could win - its something that could get the cartoon further, plus i think its for £5000 or £2000 - i dunno though. Then theres the college one...whadda ya win? Nout!  More news on this as it develops.    So like i said, i'm goin to talk about the year just gone...    What is there to talk about to start off with? Well theres been the ups, theres been the downs, and theres been the inbetweenie bits. Personally i liked the ups really.  Firstly, theres the time we brought Mike into our group. What a jolly time that was. At that time i didnt really know him, but he stuck to us like aids to a gay man. And over the time, i've been the one to sit by him, i took him under our wing at first, and now he's one of us he's gotten too big for his boots!   Then, theres the times that people get a wee bit too silly and start to throw food. Ok, thats died down a bit now, so i'm pleased with that, but it does start to creep in with Sam, Joe and Ross. I'm hoping that maybe that'll be out of their system for next year.  We also had our fun laughing at the people that walk past. Theres the regulars - afro man, the gangster woman, various teachers, and the girls sam likes. Didnt really work the last couple of weeks because everyone just seems to of disappeared!   Ok, now this is the point where i'm running outta ideas, so i'm just gonna go to my top ten rememberable things of the year, in no particular order:    1)  Joe and Mark trying on Mels coat   - So funny that it actually fit Joe and Mark just looked gay!  2)  The banana throwing  - What a mess!I know it was silly but still fun!  3)  Mark and Andrew wrapping scarves and bandages round their heads  4)  Mark and Jason falling over when Mark took him down   5)  Jason screaming loudly   6)  Big Wok - Rocky birthday announcement - Andrew and Nikki wedding announcement  - This is one of the most memorable things that happened when we was out of college. (Note: Rocky was a biker looking man and the announcement said '...and happy birthday to Rocky, whos showing off his new beard!')  7)  Ross getting beaten on Martins phone  - You'd have to see it first, but was quite funny when the 2 Tom's kept hitting Ross, one which went right in the face!  8)  Joe drinking the mix of rock, milkshake and coke   - Rock, as in the sweet variety, strawberry milkshake and coke dont go well together, just ask Joe. He really did look sick!  9) Martin under the table  - I think this was the first and last time this happened because he got a good kicking from everyone when he was under there, plus he couldnt get out, plus a teacher saw him.  10)  Mike hitting Jasons nose  - Some might say that it was my fault for touching mikes tit, but he shouldnt of punched out at me, especially when Jason was in the middle, and he knew it was him because he went to the toilet with Jason. Anyway, if it was me then i've already apologised to Jason.  And then my top five irritable things:    1)  Sam and Joe punching things   - Was there really any need or any point? What is it about punching table legs, bars on the bus, other peoples knees that they get of on so much?  2)  Sam hitting people when he sees a yellow car   - Again, whats the point in this? Every single time he sees a yellow car, he hits people. I've told him before that he can hit me if i allow him to hit me, and i havent yet he still does. He needs to stop this before someone hits him back........hard!  3)  People spilling coke/throwing food/blowing things off the table  - Ok,i know the spilling of coke has stopped, which i'm glad of, but people still threw food. If they wanted to do this then they can go home and do it there, but not in a public place e.g. college or restaurants.   4)  Immaturity  - A number of people have told me this is Sam that they have seen doing it, and i have to agree. Sam must be without doubt the biggest baby i've met!  5)  People taking other peoples things, e.g. bags, coats etc.  - What the fasination is i dont know.   Tommorow i'll be ranking the immaturity of people, starting with Sam. Find out the rest tommorow. Also, i'll be weighing the pro's and con's of cutting my hair...short!  If you want to add anything to anything i've said, then you can comment on each blogging at the bottom somewhere...  Thanks a lot people, come back tommorow,  - Peace -
