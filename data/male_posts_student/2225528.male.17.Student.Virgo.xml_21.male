Sigh.. things are really getting rough right UP there.. my brain is clogging with the utmost crappiest emotion that no other sane humans could ever experience.. Are we naturally occured born to be happy or troubled beings? Indeed we are humans.. WITH emotions..   I can't go on like this.. I can't..
