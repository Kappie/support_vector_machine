Anyway I bought a few albums and a new jacket and wallet, both fit the idea of being 'smart/casual', which seems to be my current adopted style. Except for my hair which is just a mess.  My lunch consisted of going in to a small caf√© known as 'The Crypt', a quick fifteen minute lunch extended to an hour due to their incompetence but after a complaint a full refund was obtained which equalled a free lunch for me. Top stuff!  After lunch I noticed an absurd number of fat people roaming the streets, maybe it was as I had just had lunch or they only come out after midday, point is, if your fat, why don't you try and make an attempt at hiding it, or more to the point, not advertising, for example, for the seriously obese, a 'crop top' is  not  a good idea. Wear a lot of black, and keep away from stripes. Worked for me when I was a bit podgy.
