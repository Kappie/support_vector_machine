The crowd murmered and groaned, their only sign of appreciation in their state of pure inebriation. There were no cheers, and no clapping. The song ended as soon as it had begun, and the man stepped down to get a glass of liquid. Perhaps this was not such a great choice.. One of the drunken customers swept up the stage and grabbed the poor man's guitar. He immediatly smashed it over the nearest amplifier, shattering the better half of it into shards and splints. What remained in his hand was the long neck of the device, which was now more of a sharpened spear. Laughing like a maniac at his own joke, he pointed at the artist with the spear and giggled. "Looook 'ow ol' he iss!" was heard throughout the bar by those still in the condition to decipher conversation. Still laughing like there would be no tomorrow, he jumped off the stage, spear in hand. He didn't quite remember what he was doing up on the stage, but he had some feeling that the artist next to him was a dangerous murderer.     The fender telecaster peirced his chest four times.       Disoriented and unable to breath, his deep red lifeline flowed like a river from his mouth, ears, and of course his torso.       It took the paramedics twenty minutes to get there. Car pile-up just outside the exit ramp that leads to this place..One cat in the middle of the road, and everything goes straight to hell.     "It's a shame.." "Indeed. Want me to make the call?" "Are you joking? It's Friday, I don't want to deal with this." "Ok, to the incinerator then?" "Yeah, quickly though."  His body was incinerated, and the ashes were thrown in a simple blue plastic garbage bag.       Biography of Scott Shaffer's death, by Donnie Hicks.
