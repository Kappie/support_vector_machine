I like redheads (even though they're trouble).  I like blondes just because( does a man need an answer?) they're blonde.  I like politics and arguing, and people in general.  I havea  strange yet developed sense of humor that sometimes gets me into trouble.  Ah well.  On to the reason for this lovely blog (that is such a nasty sounding word by the way, it vaguely sounds like it should be a curse, like "I'm gonna blog you good", but maybe thats just me)  The reason, oh yes, is life.  Life is a journey blah blah blah, you hear that garbage every day.  But in it's essence the sentiment is true.  What life is really made up of is a series of vignettes, stroies and anecdotes that stick in our mind as if they were super glued.  We don't remember everything (Thank God) but we do remember what counts.  That my dear blogees (that term sounds slightly sexual by the way) is what it's all about.  Those collection of moments that stick in our brains and are suspended there as if they were trapped by some blessed flypaper.  That dear friends is what I will endeavor to jot down.  Stories of me, stroies of others, thoughts, dreams and realizations.  I could fill this blog about tripe like what I did that day, and what I ate for breakfast, but you don't care about that hogwash and I won't pretend that you do.......   So there! My intro is complete  Welcome to my world.
