Just kidding, kukuku. I love that laugh. It freaks out Li so much, and she can't do anything about it till Mini-con. I'll be sure to wear a cup then, kukuku. Anyways! I like this more than Xanga, because it gives you more editing options. Which is good and all. Bad thing: I don't know all that much XML, so I can't really do too much, kukuku. If you don't know, feel free to ask why my name is Rachel, or Kitty-Itachi. It'll be a very long, interesting story. Very funny, though.
