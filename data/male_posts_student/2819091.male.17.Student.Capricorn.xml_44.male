It does feel sad that it happened but face it, Sometimes unimaginable things happen. Whether it was bad or good, It is bound to have happened. If you want to change it, change it... Don't continue on crying in your miserable corner, That is just too pathetic. Really idiotic. Though this might come off cold, You know it is time to face this truth... It is pathetic... Idiotic to be exact. The one that you fell in love with is gone, The one whom you truly cared for is gone. People closest to you are now gone, They have left you to move on. It is time for you to do the same one, Pack up your misery and move on. The one you love is gone... Truly gone. No use crying, no one will hear you. No use screaming, no one will comfort you. No use at all. Simply no use... All you have left is two words, Two simple words... Two words... Move on.
