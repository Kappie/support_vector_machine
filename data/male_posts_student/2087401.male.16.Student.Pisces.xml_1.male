I got into a handicapped shopping cart with Jonah and Antonio *Jimenez and we drove around until we ended up in a bar.  We got into a fight, then Tiffany *Webb jumped down into the middle of it and started doing all this crazy Kung-fu stuff.  After they all left, we all got into the cart and Tiffany told us they'd moved headquarters and she showed us how to get to the new location.  It turned out to be a huge white Mansion.  Tiffany told us to check our room assignments on the way in.  Mine said I was rooming with David *Meyer.  I got up there and Amy *Solenburg was sitting on the other bed.  She told me she had switched with David because he wanted to be with Katrina, and she was sure I wouldn't mind (wink wink).  Unfortunately, I didn't get to find out what she meant by that, because I'm sure I would have enjoyed it.  So anyway, I went down stairs and TIm *Dinger in a Greek army uniform, Tracy *Rinker and Jessica *Silvey in Silver jumpsuits, and George Lucas went through an interdimensional gateway.  I had to go to a meeting.  Then it starts getting really fuzzy.
