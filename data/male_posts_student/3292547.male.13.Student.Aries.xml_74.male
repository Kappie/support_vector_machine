I'll be updating my current book "section" at the side --> in a few minutes once I get done typing up this post and the next.   The last one had me on my feet and I couldn't put it down for the last hour because of everything that was happening. I must confess that reading 10 books is getting irritating just a bit. A very little bit but a bit none-the-less. Next time we go to  urlLink Wal-Mart    I've got to pick up the 8th, 9th, and 10th ones. Last time I checked though they didn't have the 8th so I'll probably have to buy it at  urlLink Books-A-Million.  I took to buying 3 books at a time up until this very last here I bought only 2 since the 7th wasn't there.   Well, enough of that. Onto my next post =-)
