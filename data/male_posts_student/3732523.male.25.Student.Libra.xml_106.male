For this is the Swiss National Day, or as it seems for all the neighbor kids, fireworks day.  Actually, many did not wait till today. I heard many a firework exploding last night as well as throughout the day. But only now is it getting really loud.  Surprisingly, it does not seem that much different than the USA 4th, but instead of red, white, and blue, there are only the first two colors.  The Swiss channels are filled with music from the 4 different cultural areas of Switzerland.  Throughout the mountains, one can probably see many a bonfire.  I'm not Swiss of course, so for me its a manner of curiousity.  Perhaps a bit of annoyance, in that its a holiday that I don't get off as I work in Liechtenstein, and only live in Switzerland, but it doesn't really matter as it fell on a Sunday this time.  Incidently, I don't get the Liechtenstein holiday off either in 2 weeks as it will be on a Sunday as well. Oh well.  So how am I spending my Swiss Day?  Doing nothing..or close to it.  I woke up with a back ache that was most likely caused by my running down a mountain on Saturday at full speed. Thus, it was filled with me playing the odd computer game and lots of television, including 3 hours worth of East Enders on BBC Prime.  Amazing, how I managed to get myself hooked to that series.  So, a week from now I shall be at BOMO if all goes to plan.  It should be a nice change of place from the Swiss way of things :)
