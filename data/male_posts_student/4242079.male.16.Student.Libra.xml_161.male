Neither of us had any plans, so we got some beer and went over to John and Matt's place. Dr. Smooth strikes again, breaking both a hand railing for the stairs, and the towel holder in the bathroom. Rye, pringles, beer and ju jubes. Those four things do NOT taste that good the second time 'round.    And I, for one, am not the type of person who will dwell on things that happen when drunk. If something happens, you can't allow it to affect your relationship with others once you are sober. It's like living two lives.  Still, I can't ignore it.    all in all, i feel good today.
