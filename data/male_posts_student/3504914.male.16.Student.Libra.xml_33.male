Well, I was looking through pictures of my two bros, and realised I don’t have any pictures of either my mother or father.     I worry a lot about my family, even my sister. People seem to think I hate her outright, for no reason at all. No, I’m just angry at her constantly xD I mean whenever I tell her to do something for her own good she tells me to shut up, and nobody seems to understand this. She refuses to listen to anybody in my family, and therefore I get irate. What’s my point? I don’t rightly know.     Ah well, I can’t seem to make up my mind on what I should further write. So I’ll just post random pieces of writing I’ve developed in 2004, none of which are finished.    ___________________       Story One: The Messiah   (Two days old and it looks like I may continue it!)      The sun glimmered through a crack in the cobalt curtains, but this alone was not enough to awake the person under the blanket.     The mini-compo sounded off, playing what seemed to be a darker, more sinister version of lounge music.     A rustle in the bed.     Awaken, and come hither, through the lands of the wakeful.     A yawn.    A grumble.     The door to the bedroom opened, screeching ever so silently as it did.     “Wake up!”     Then the door was closed, and the air of finality on those words was absolute.     The being inside the bed grasped outwards for the remote control and, out of habit, immediately found the power button.     In a laid-back and graceful motion, the blanket was lifted, and soon the teen stood on the ground, feeling groggy.     Slowly, he made his way towards the redwood door and with a twist of the doorknob and a push with his forehead, the door opened up into the hallway.           ___________________     Story Two: The Sins of Heaven   (An Extract from a Role-play battle)      Time: Indefinite, Place: Cloud of Warriors, Heaven      “Sir Adrian Tafford, your presence is requested on Cloud Nine. I repeat, your pre-”     The knight held his gladius right at the obese messenger-angel’s belly. “QUIET! My head hurts, I drunk  a lot  last night.”     “Yes Sir” A globule of sweat descended the angel’s round face. “May I go now, Sir?”     Decanus waved his left hand dismissively and waited until the angel had gone to return his sword into its sheath.  What a grand start to a day . You could just feel the sarcasm ooze off him.         Time: Indefinite, Place: Cloud Nine- The Cloud of Pompous Angels Galore, Heaven      “Tafford, stand to attention!”     Adrian was currently rubbing his temples with his fists, looking at the fluffy ground, trying to purge himself of the pain he was feeling. Owing to this, he didn’t hear the words the first time spoken.     “Tafford, I said stand to attention, whelp!”     A lucid foot came sliding into the knight’s stomach, and resulted in a lot of vomit on Adrian’s part.     “You could have asked nicely…” Decanus put in after he was sure he wasn’t going to misplace anymore of last night’s supper of beer and eggs.     “I’ve heard a lot about you Sir Adrian, and despite you looking like a overall wreck job, I hear you’d be the perfect man for the job I’m about to put forward.”     Adrian mumbled something around the grounds of “Pompous windbag.”     The speaker apparently didn’t hear, or chose not to. “Have you ever heard of Heretic?”     Despite recovering from a hangover, the name rung a bell almost instantly. “The sword?”     “Yes, the sword. Well, it used to be under the direction of Sarakon, as you may well know, but it appeared he had a change of heart and decided it would be perfectly safe floating in the infinite plane of the Nexus. Silly bastard.”     This time Decanus’ words were crystal clear. “Don’t scandalise the name of any warrior, no matter what side he plays for, you portly bastard.” Sarakon, despite his misdoings, was a stalwart warrior who Adrian had paid some attention to during his ‘lunch breaks’.        The speaker laughed. “You’re well aware that I could send you to hell for that remark, right?”     Adrian let out a vocal roar to clear his head. When he finally looked up, he saw who had been speaking. ‘Twas one of the Cherubim. They had some sort of vendetta against him; God knew why, wherever HE was. “Yes, you probably could. But Hell isn’t as bad a place as most people make it out to be. At least you wouldn’t be there…”     The Cherub Adrian spoke to became flustered. Such creatures were often talked to with reverence and a certain kind of fear. Adrian’s voice and soul carried neither. “Well, moving right along,” The Cherubim twiddled his chubby fingers, “Heretic was taken from its resting ground by a demon named Morkrall Dalarion.”     Decanus grumbled. “And let me guess, I have to get back Heretic, and either destroy it or reseal it properly, right? Will I be getting some mystical scroll to help me in this?”     “No…” A pause. “You will give it to me…”     A spark of anger flared through Adrian’s eyes, and it now chorused through his voice. “What, do you hope to control that damned sword’s power? Do you think you could charge the Seraphim with such a weapon?”            “Why else haven’t they destroyed it? That thing is beyond good or evil, it is in a rank of its own… Now, I am not asking you, I am telling you, claim it for me…”    Adrian knew better than to argue, but even in that moment, he knew that he would not give the sword over to this ostentatious fuck. Tafford mock-bowed, and then exited, stage fourth dimension.        Time: Five Hours After Sunrise, Place: Naturo Village, Paradise      Sir Decanus had, after consulting the pub master in Heaven, discovered the locality to where Morkrall was to be hiding. Now he was here, Adrian figured it to be the perfect place for any madman to be hiding with such a weapon as Heretic.     Yet, some things nagged at Adrian’s mind, like a whore demanding more money. First of all, how fucking powerful would one have to be to rupture a seal established by Sarakon, who was acclaimed to be both a fair fighter and a magician much mightier than Tafford himself? Secondly, how could anybody have carried Heretic for an elongated period of time without news of mysteriously killings? Both irritated Adrian like an itch that would not go away, and both indicated this Morkrall character would be a lot stronger than a few of the folks Decanus had met on the plain, and more recently plane, of battle.     But first things first. Adrian had to scrutinise out the lay of the land. This place was altogether new to him, and did not seem to cite the same laws as Earth. The people, the Paradisians they liked to call themselves, were all a great deal merrier than Adrian would have liked. You could not pass a single one without being greeted with a “Howdy How” and a doggedness of shaking hands. All of them were possessive of blonde hair, and yet relatively dark skin. Their eyes were truly interesting, sparkling of multiple colours at once, like a rainbow caught in a twirling vortex. Otherwise, they were what could pass for human.     The place itself, this Naturo Village as it was called in their dialect, was an attention-grabbing feat of architecture. Not a single building was attached to the ground in any direct physical means of contact. The village was, in fact, suspended from the bulky branches of what looked to be enormous oaks. Copious plateaus made up the village, seemingly divided by age, with the oldest living at the bottom, and the youngest living at the top. Decanus figured this to be because air got thinner the higher up you got.     Despite the population of the village only reaching two hundred, three hundred and fifty if you included women and children, there were hundreds of bridges and ropes, all artificial and yet wrapped in wildlife as if they were parts of it themselves. It seemed there were farming communities up here as well, actually harvesting sap from the bodies of these great trees, and, as Adrian had first found out an hour back, it was an astonishingly good hangover cure.     Finally, there were the physics of this place. It seemed that the gravity here was lighter, which may have attributed to the enormous growth of the trees themselves. He had seen men jump from building to building, despite being at least ten metres apart, and it was after seeing this that he had asked his guide why they had bridges at all. The guide’s reply? “Its for you smelly tourists…” The man had grinned, and Adrian could not help but grin along.     And now this had all been taken into consideration, Tafford could properly conduct his investigation. He did not expect to find anything here, for it was after all the first of fifty villages here on Paradise that Morkrall could be hiding on, and there was thus a 1/50 chance that he would be in this one.     Personally, Sir Adrian had his reservations about the whole mess. He couldn’t tell a Seraph, for the Cherub would denounce these accusations, and as it stood, Adrian was off a lower class, and wouldn’t be believed. He couldn’t tell Michael or any of the other archangels, because if they got involved, they could be cast into the abyss themselves. And if Tafford did actually find the sword, what then?     The sword would almost instantaneously take control of him, and Decanus would try to please its whims by bloodshed. And if by some chance he resisted its powers, what then? He couldn’t return it, for that would result in certain chaos in the realms of Heaven. He could try and destroy it, but he knew nobody who had heard of a way. And the final act of resealing it seemed idiotic. Some fool would only unseal it and this whole process would repeat again, but the next man charged with finding it might be one who didn’t have as clear a head as Decanus.     A voice rung in his head, the voice of Sir Harold Orpheus. “First things first, you can worry about the number two later!”     He nodded to himself, and Adrian began walking across one of the bridges which led to the top level, and from there he would work downwards. A sound plan indeed.                    ___________________     Story Three: The Revolution of England   (Part of a role-play, that’s why some of the transition are dodgy at best. The dialogue of Liam is written by Simon, friend of mine)      “Hands against the wall sonny boy, that’s right, spread your legs…”     Adrian faked a grin, but hoped it looked natural enough. “Look officer, what have I done?”     “Nothing…” The old bloke raised a whitened eyebrow. “Yet…”     In a minute, the examination was over, and the policeman told Adrian he was “free to go”.     “Thank you officer, you keep holding up that law eh?” Adrian let out a chuckle, waved at the frowning old man and swivelled around on a single foot.     He started at a fair pace back towards his house, relieved of the fact he hadn’t been carrying his pop’s classic Derringer handgun. This, Adrian hid in the old family Bible, via method of cutting and removing a square block in the middle of all the pages. Nobody touched the Bible anymore; it held no solution to the jobs being lost to the aliens who were content on being paid less for more hours.    Adrian had heard the other day some foreign sympathisers saying that the foreigners deserved the jobs if they would work for less. Adrian had almost said out loud that they only worked for less because they didn’t know any better. But a cop had passed by, and Adrian had kept his mouth closed.     Making such remarks now was punishable by a full investigation of your house, and questioning of all your mates of your behaviour as of late. It was as if anybody who hated the situation was a member of the People’s Army.     Fucking loony.    Adrian smiled, he was home. He had made it through yet another day of craziness. He knocked on the door, and it opened minutes later, his mother was on the other side.    “Adrian! Where have you been? You know with all these people thinking they’re guerrillas running around you should be in by six. I mean honestly, just an hour earlier a hooligan was running around in his underwear pulled over his head claiming he was the messiah and that he would free England of all these dirty job-stealers.”     Adrian laughed. It was probably Kingsley on another of his beer runs. “No need to worry mom, I was just seeing some friends, you know. Ah well, I’m tired, I better sleep eh? Night night.”     His mother gave him that eyebrow that said “You are such a weird kid.” But her mouth said “Fine, sleep tight.”     One step, two step, three step, four step, five step, six step, seven step, eight. Adrian’s turf now, he grabbed the brass knob and turned it. A creaking as the handle turned, from lack of oiling, and soon the mildewed pong of his room engulfed his senses. He noted the time on his digital alarm clock; from years ago when his family had still been doing great, and it told him it was barely ten minutes past seven.      Ha, she worries too much, that old girl does      Alone in the corner of his room, by the dusty window, atop a small table, was a radio that looked as if it had been built during World War 2. It worked well enough though, and this Adrian now turned on. He moved the dial slightly, pointing it to 87.2 FM, known as Revolutionary Radio to some.     It was an entirely legal station, but what the government didn’t know was that the second word in each song could be pieced together to form a message alerting rebels of news the government would no longer release on TV or radio for that matter.     Today, after almost two hours of listening, Adrian found the news to be quite interesting. It was something about a raid on the docks by a group of beggars. Though the attempt failed, it was more than the IEA had ever done. Adrian wished for something interesting to happen for once.     He remembered it had only been two weeks since he and Liam had first joined, and they had both expected it to be a far more adventurous lifestyle. So far the most audacious thing they’d been forced to do is pick up canned tuna rations in what was supposedly a black market, but from the woman in charge, it seemed to be just your everyday grocery store.     Adrian took a seat on his old hickory chair, and tapped his fingers restlessly against the redwood desk.          A rustle outside the window. Adrian turned his head. Slowly he edged his fingers across the desk, towards the window frame, and he pushed upwards carefully. When the window was a quarter way open, Adrian let out a careless whisper. “Who’s out there?”     No reply besides the faint puff of air that breezed by. Then another rustle, and suddenly something shot out of the bush. For a split second, Adrian thought it to be the hand of a SAS operator, but this was stupid. He hadn’t done anything, technically. Ah, a chipmunk.      You’re getting tense, Adrian mi boy. You need a beer like you need a woman      Adrian grinned and spoke out to himself; hardly realising he was doing it. “But now even sex is considered tyranny, since you never know  what  you’ll murmur into your lover’s ear…”     No copper was wandering the streets tonight, and even if there had been they wouldn’t have heard it. The window led out to the backyard, little as it may be, was not near much except the wildlife. So far as Adrian had heard, the birds had yet to be trained to eavesdrop on suspects.      I think you should go get that beer     Adrian nodded to himself, and opened the window wider, keeping it ajar by using a wooden ruler as a prop. He went back to his drawer, opened it, and took out his wool coat. At 5’7, Adrian didn’t exactly stand out in the crowd, and the coat helped his indistinctness. Along with this, he removed a panama hat, black in colour with a white headband. What could he say? He loved his hat. After grabbing a red crayon from the desk, which he stuffed into one of many pockets in his coat, he lobbed himself carefully out the window, onto the somewhat soggy grass below.      Time to move      Adrian moved quietly towards the meeting place.     He had left at around 9:27, and it usually took ten minutes to get there, give or take. No patrols tonight, they were probably busy busting some footie hooligans. Apparently England had lost to France,  again . The England team were poorly equipped these days, and horridly trained. It was a pain in the heart for anybody who had supported England even two years ago, before it had gotten terribly serious.       The meeting place was a dilapidated Tudor-styled house; it had been many years since this place had been occupied (for more than a few hours that is). Adrian brought out the crayon and made a stick figure drawing by the glass to indicate he was here, to anybody who knew the code; police would hopefully look over it as a child’s drawing.     There had been only ever been three people who knew it, and one of those was currently being held in jail for speaking out towards the PM. The other was Liam. Where the fuck that guy was, Adrian didn’t know. Did it matter? Yes. For all he knew, Liam was occupying a cell right by Kira.     After warily entering the house by the door, for it was hardly ever locked, he went over to the cooler, and opened it. There was some inexplicable link between the people who used this house as a meeting point. Though you hardly ever knew the other visitors, there was a rule at re-stocking the cooler when it was vacant, out of courtesy.     The choice of beer was usually alright as well, but it looked like tonight Adrian would have to be content with Foster beer, an Australian brand much cheaper than either Amstel or Carlsberg. He took it down like a man, and reclined on a single sofa chair. It was comfortable here, if you didn’t mind the occasional rat and such. Thoughts came to you in a flood when you were here.     Who was it he had mentioned earlier? Kira right? Hah, her. She had been younger than them both, but mad. Pure, utterly mad. The kind of gal guys fell for, but was scared of at the same time. She had been arrested at least a year ago for denouncing the PM as the horrid result of a rape victim. Adrian had fancied her, in a way, but she had always been more like one of the guys than gals. In fact, Adrian swore she could have beaten up half the guys he knew. Wherever she was now, she was sure to be yelling her head off      Adrian took another beer from the cooler, and popped it open. He let it get some air before drinking from it. Usually he wouldn’t loiter here in the dark for very long, but tonight he felt something was going to alter his life, and it was for this he sat perfectly still, listening to the sound of his heartbeat. He hoped he would also be able to hear the heartbeats of the police who could, at any second, bust in on his alcohol-induced meditation.     And he thought he heard a sound.       “Fucking hell! So dark in here I didn’t even see you man, Jesus, gave me a bloody heart attack.”     Adrian simply grinned, bringing his free left hand around and onto his head, and scratched his scalp apologetically. He waited before saying anything further, he knew better around Liam. Whenever the guy got jolted, he needed his beer in his hand before relaxing.     “So, anything new?” Liam’s usual matter-at-hand tone.     Adrian downed the rest of the beer, letting it stay in his mouth for a while before sinking it down his throat. Much better.  Onto business .      “I suppose you’ve heard of the thing down at the docks?”     "No, what about the docks? More immigrants coming in the country on the ships?"  Said Liam between gulps of Fosters.     Adrian grinned. “Nah, not this time, apparently some beggars got busted down there for a raid. It’s amazing how they seem more intent on helping themselves than this bloody IEA. I thought we were getting ourselves into action!”    Liam scowled and shook his head in disgust. "What do you expect mate, fucking majority of people these days are out for themselves, and can you blame them? Most of us that do our bit for the country end up dead pretty quickly, just a shame that more people are interested in looking after themselves than sorting this country out."    Adrian nodded while listening, his body in a slightly hunched position in the chair. A spark flared through his eyes, the dangerous kind that meant he was thinking something big. “Why don’t’ we take initiative eh? Why not? We’re supposedly fucking equals in the IEA, I’m sure they wouldn’t mind if we somehow managed to somehow humiliate parliament.”      Liam smiled voluntarily as he cracked open a second beer, which fizzed up uncontrollably and oozed out of the top, forcing Liam to put his mouth to the foaming liquid and do his best to drink it up rapidly to avoid excess spillage. "Well," he coughed "It's all well and good, us taking the initiative and you're right, I think we should. But we've got a long way to go before we can attack parliament directly if it's just the two of us working for the cause. We need to start off small, rally people to the cause and then do the bigger things. Going for the jugular right now is a sure way of ending up like the Butsfarm lot"    Adrian simmered down. Personally, he tried to avoid mentioning the Butsfarm incident, simply because Liam had history there. “Yes, I suppose you’re right. But you know how it is now, you can’t get into a group bigger than five without looking suspicious, and you can’t exactly trust anybody anymore. You remember what happened to Bobby? Got turned in by his own lifelong buddy he did. Sad shit right there.” Adrian took a breath of air, not exactly fresh but whatever. “How are we supposed to rally causes when this is the state of situation?”    Liam took a long sip of his beer while contemplating how he'd answer. Truth is he had no answers, the situation was pretty bleak for the Independent English army, but they had to at least try something. "There's not much we can do, aside from lead by example. If we can start making successful raids, getting our group known on the streets, sooner or later people will join. We may not be able to trust them all but that's just a chance we've got to take man, sometimes to win a war you need to take risks"    Nodding, Adrian brought both his hands through his hair, sifting out any dust that might have been in it. “I can’t think of a better idea.” He turned, faced Liam, and grinned. “You still keep that  diary  of yours? Maybe that holds the key to this whole mess.” He chuckled. You never knew, maybe Liam recorded stuff of interest in it, such as envoy visits and the likes. Maybe not.    "Yeah I still keep the diary, there's not much of interest though, just notes about my day, the situation. The usual stuff really, there was a recent article in the Informer that I glued in there though, something about a French Police official visiting the Met to discuss some of this policy unification euro bollocks". Liam yawned, cupping his hand to his mouth. "Not sure what we can do about that though."    Adrian tapped at his temple with his fore and middle fingers, and after a few seconds, stilled them as they touched his skin. “Hm, you know how, even now we’re all still pretty much united against the French right? Well, he’s obviously not going to be well guarded right; I mean French officers aren’t exactly allowed to be roaming our streets eh? And English guards, almost certainly not. If we somehow managed to get him in our grasps for a few minutes, we could probably tie some fucking large wooden sign around his neck telling the EU to go suck balls or something.” Adrian lacked the democratic tongue. “Plus, France would be pretty buggered about how England just let a representative of their frog-eating race get captured by  hooligans . No doubt parliament will launch a front against these  hooligans  to protect their image, but its doubtful they’ll do much more than just accuse the People’s Army of England for it. The people though, they might just try dig deeper and find us responsible. I know it’s faulty, but I’m hoping you could fill in whatever I may have missed.”       Liam scratched his chin. "You're right that no true Englishman likes the French, but don't forget this is all Europe shit now, they'd have no problem sending French EU officers to accompany him, but I doubt there'll be any English people rushing to keep him company and because he's such a low profile person you're probably right about the security too. and despite his low profile, an attack on him could raise our own standing quite a bit, locally at least. I wouldn't want to really hurt him though you know, maybe rough him up a bit and deal with the guards but i don't want to do anything too extreme to him even if he is French."    “Right, like you wouldn’t use an iron gauntlet to slap his face.” Adrian smiled. “You know, this might just work… But we’d have to get lucky about the security, hopefully they’ll only be carrying batons and pistols, but if they’re using sub-machine guns, we’ll have to call it off. But where in London could we POSSIBLY catch them off guard? We’d have to both watch the convoy along with our own backs for patrols.”    "Ah come on man," Liam interrupted, "With London's winding streets, alleys and all that one way system shit there must be plenty of places we can ambush him"    "Like where, you have a better mental picture of the place than me."    "We need to know where the fuck he's going first obviously. You done with that beer yet? I'll get us a couple more cans" Liam said as he took a half step to the fridge and delved inside for more booze.     “Been done for ages, man.” He sighed, looking at the empty bottle with a far off look in his eyes. “What’s the time?”    "Fucking twenty past, mate." He called without looking back from the fridge. "Twenty past ten on a spring night, we should be down the pub or something, out on the pull" He said sounded disheartened as he handed Adrian a can of Fosters and cracked open his third, which thankfully was less energetic than the last one.     Adrian popped his open and simply took a sniff at it, holding it under his chin with both hands. “We always could go down to the pub, see how things are going.” He laughed. “Maybe we’d even catch a decent show on the telly there.”     TV was horrid for the most part now, and hardly ever was in English. You had the German melodrama shows, the hairy French women parading naked through magical fields, and Swiss cheese critique shows. He took down the beer as an image of some French lady paraded her hairy beaver towards the mental screen in his head.     Ah, the lines of a song came into Adrian’s head, a Rolling Stones classic. He hummed it out loud, trying to sing at the same time. “I see a red door and I want it painted black…” He stopped. “You know what, I better be going home, I promised me old man a day ago I’d get the kitchen door fixed, and I think I’ll be needing my energy tomorrow for it.”    Liam nodded and grinned "Fairplay mate, I think I'm just going to stick around here for a bit, have a few more drinks and then I'll sod off myself. Won't drink too much though, don't want to be stuck with the job of restocking the fridge, cost me enough last time"     “Later on, man.” He laughed. “See you whenever that sherry-sipping bastard comes around. Hopefully a few times before unless we want to end like Swiss cheese.”     Adrian picked himself up, and the beer was already heavy in his gut. He made a short salute in Liam’s direction, and hobbled off. It had turned out to be an alright day after all. They would show what it meant to be English! Eventually…
