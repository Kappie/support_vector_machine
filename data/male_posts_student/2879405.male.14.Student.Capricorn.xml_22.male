She is leaving as she only takes over Mrs Champion untill the Mid-Year Exams. Today is RI VS DAMAI at turf city, which is no doubt the match of the season. The score has been 2-2 going through extra time. Exciting and vacum tight game. it was 3-3 in extra time. Both teams escaped from hell, facing heaven. So the poor umpire had to spend more time with them in extra time, rather then having the privillage of sleeping at home. in was the same for the next inning. Again 4-4. But the next was diferent. RI caught up with awakening spirit to score just 1 run to win the game. The end. The good and bad had now been obvious and clear. Separated with tears.
