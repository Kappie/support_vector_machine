When I was typing my blog on Sunday, and I hit the communion part complainin' about the people sitting beside me, I was wondering if I was the only one that even noticed.  Apparently not. I read Gavin's blog, and I'm happy to know that the others around me are mature enough to realize that that behaviour was really immature. So it's nice to see how we are all maturing more and more Spiritually and how we can all relate to another, but I really hope that we can help the others grow more. But still when I think about Communion, I wonder how some people can just be so thick-headed and not get it...
