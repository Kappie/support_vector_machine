Sorry.  For those of you new here (which, considering this is my first post is all of you) I'll give you a brief introduction.  My name is Dr. Smooth (although apparently that was already taken as a Blog name, so my online name here is Dr. Smooothe).  I actually did not give myself this nickname, no sir-ree bob.  This was blessed upon me by some people I know.  I could explain why, but I don't feel like embarassing myself.  Let's tell you a little about myself.  I'm a third-year medical student at a medical school in the midwestern USA.  I'm not going to say which one to protect the privacy of those who might be mentioned on here.  I've just started my third-year rotations about two months ago, and oh do I have some stories!  Especially the psych ward at the county hospital here.  For example, there's the bipolar/borderline personality lady, who at 31 years of age has already had three children by three different fathers, all while spending at least half of her adult life committed to mental hospitals.  Oh yeah, she also has delusional fantasies about the Judge who committed her, and sends him love notes and erotic phone calls.  And she refuses to take medications, claiming God healed her ... to the extent that she punched a nurse after she tried to get her to take her pills.  Never a dull moment in psychiatry.  Right now, though, I'm doing inpatient internal medicine at the same place.  I have two patients who are just about impossible to communicate with.  Patient one (we'll call her Judith) is so hard of hearing that you have to scream into one of her ears just to get her to understand you.  Well, either that or write it down on paper.  My second patient (known as Alex) had squamous cell cancer on his vocal cords in 1996, following decades of tobacco use.  He subsequently had his vocal cords removed which renders him unable to speak and be the grouchy old man I'm sure he longs to be.  He's got pneumonia, kidney insufficiency, and breathes through a trach hole, but other than that, he's happy as a clam.   Hope you all have a restful and happy evening.  I'll catch ya on the flipside.  ciao, -Smooothe
