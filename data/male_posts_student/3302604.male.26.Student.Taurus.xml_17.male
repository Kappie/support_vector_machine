Only one week of revision and three exams and then months of glorious freedom (if you don;t count the teaching placemant I've got to do before next term.  It's a bit weird to think that, once this term ends, I'll be half way through my degree course. I mean, I might have learnt something, but it doesn't feel I'm half way to being a qualified mathematician. I knpw a few more things that I did before I started but there must be something more out there that they're hiding from us. Everything so far seems to be preparation for something else.  Still, on Friday I'll be talking to the inspectors about what I think about the department. I don't know if they expect any startling insights but if they ask me a quaestion then I guess I'll have to answer it in the best way I know.   This may be all very well, but with two more years left, everything from now on counts towards the final mark, so it's time to stop shirking (something I've managed very well so far thank you  very much) and actually get down and do some work.  The ironic thing is, though that I decided to do teaching first and then picked a subject I was good at when I chose to do this course, but now, what with the badly organised education part of the course, I'm totally sick of the teaching part and really enjoying the maths. In fact, if the teaching placement does not go well this summer, I am very tempted to go out and change course to the primary teaching one. Whether this means the I've got to redo some bits or go somewhere else (maybe Moray House) I don't know but right now I don't care.  Isn't it fun finding out  Jack
