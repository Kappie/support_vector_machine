Just in case you don't know, green olives taste like crap.  This is the second time I've written this post, due to the fact that my crappy ass computer crashed. I hate my computer more than anything in the world, even though I use it a whole lot.  I'm sorry about the lame posts I've been having lately, it's because I keep getting up at 4:30, and I'm too tired and don't have the time to write anything clever. Here's a picture you can look at in the mean time:     Feast your eyes upon intelligent life in outer space....  Don't forget to leave comments about how amazingly attractive I am, because we all know I am.
