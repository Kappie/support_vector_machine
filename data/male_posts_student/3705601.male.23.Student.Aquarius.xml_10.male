As far as I know Rick Wakeman, who is the keyboard genius of the supergroup Yes is an amazing musician. Upon listening to the CD, I have confirmed the high level of virtuosity in which Wakeman displays his art. It is art indeed, what Rick Wakeman can do with his keyboards. It feels like a fusion of Medieval themes with futuristic keyboards (very truly "prog rock"). I also enjoy listening to Wakeman's version of the Yes classic "Starship Trooper" on this album. The song itself is tied in with another song called "Wurm", a song that I believe is a name for the jam that Wakeman does in Starship Trooper's dead time, and believe me, there's barely any dead time in that song, or any Yes song for that matter, but that's another story. Also included in the CD is a remake of the Rolling Stones' "Paint It Black" and the Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby". In these remakes and his own music, Wakeman truly shows off his genius. Wakeman is truly an awesome musician and having bought this CD for $9.99 at F.Y.E. in the Mall of New Hampshire in Manchester is the biggest steall since buying Rush's "2112" for the same amount in Best Buy. After listening to the CD, I realize why I wanted to learn the keyboards (something I am doing so now), Wakeman, Jon Lord (of Deep Purple), Ray Manzarek (of "The Doors"), and of course, Geddy Lee (singer, bass player, and synth guy for "Rush") are truly the best among rock keyboard players. Keyboards rule!
