Then .. i msg-ed MinG chUan..yeah..cos as usual she was on my mind..the whole time. then she told me she was like gonna learn how to break.. then thots ran thru my head.. i kinda suddenly feel that.. i'm not good enough for her manz. she's like so cooool and hip and stuffz. and i'm like sooo...loser? or is it that ..my inferiorty complex is playing tricks on me..i dunch know manz. i wish someone would tell me why and what..manz. anyway after when i reached home.. i saw shufen..online then i told her bout me feeling not good enuff for mC..then she was real nicee..as in she said lotsa comforting stuff..she was real nicez..i guess i shouldn't have talked botu mC..cos she was like later feelin moody..and didnt really wanan tok with me. i guess i shld just shuddup..next time.. =X.          okays..let's tok bout another part of the day now..lolz..after makan..we threee..w/o Loy went to wheeelock place to have coffee bean and sat there for like one hr pluz.. b4 walking to plaza singapura.. there and took mrt homeez.. everything was finee.. thru-out the day..till just now.. around 9pm+...          all b/c of amaths. the amaths results were known thru this stupid weebiex of the skool..arthur was real sad..as he got only 25/80..his amaths all the while's quite okay then this time liddat..he was real real real sad manz.. but actually he kinda deserve it a little..cos he's like always too confident and kinda proud of himself..i know it's no wrong being confident of himself..but he overdoes it..he does it for eveyr exam..and though he didn't really study much. that's why i guess it's a lesson god is teaching him..but actually i also think there's an err in the calculation or keying in of marks..cos arthur wun fail onez..he might get a c6..but surely wun fail onez..so i guess there's some human err. therez..and whereas for moses..im quite happy for him..cos he got an A1! 60/80..after the exam on tt day he was like real sad..cos..he knew he would get real low..like a B4...thoh he studied real hard..but.. god was watching over him..and he got an A1..just nice on the dot! so i guess he's real happies..then for kum long and daniel loy..they were both quite sadz too..bout amaths.. shucks..wotta spirit dampening...thing to happen..today. wellz..i got..32/80..bad..enuff too..but i didn't really feel much. jsut now told bobby bout my results. he thinks tt it's real bad. and it is real bad. tt's y he asked me to do at least 5 sums everyday...from 10 yrs series and hand in to him everyday. i 'm glad he actually ordered me to do so..so i wun get slack.           Then..audrey was also sadz..cos..over this aCs bArker guy she likes.. she took the initiative and chased after him for like a month already..but yet.. to no avail..and she was about to ask the guy how he feels bout her..and stuff..tonight..and she was like quite positive on the result to be negative.. so yeahs she was sad and stuffz like that tooZ.. so i guess today is a bLeAhS day manz..but i hope the guy will like her lahs..and it's truly like her..not take her as a SuB. for his chio bu Ex.. yeahs..          the thing tt really affected me..ish ming chuan. becos..later on in the night..which was like 1 hr back.. i msg-ed her..asking her to slp early..and forget bout her suay dayz..today. cos firstly..her hp got confiscated by the discipline master..then she almost landed herself into police station. so i msg-ed her..and tellin her to sleep early to forget bout all these..crapz feelings and events manz. then later on..during the sms..she told me..that she and her friends almost got landed into the police station b/c of stealingz.. at tt moment my heart was like really down manz. thoh mC didn't steal...but she was like helping her friends to look out. and her friends weeree stealing.. i know it's not easy for her to reject her friends's request to help them keep on a look out...so i only wished that thoh she may helped her friends..but inside..she disapproved of wht they did. but..she didn't ..she was like quite okay bout helping them. then at that moment it really got me thinking..whether did i fall in lurve with the wrong gur? then quite many thots came to me manz. i was real confused. looking back onto last yr..there was another incident..which i rmb-ed mC and her friends go finding this other gur and her friends.. and thrash things out..stuff like these. she was like some lianz liddat manz.. thoh i know she hates being a lian.. and last yr when this happened..i was real disappointed with her.. cos i never wanna her to be such a person... then she said she wun be such a person anymore..alreayd which ish gooodx. then suddenly today..come this stealing incident... which really like kinda make me think bout..her moral values and stuff manz.. im not some big moral obedient freeeak or wotx.. but at the least..i hope that the gur i like so much.. wun do things like stealing..yeahz. so i was real confused on whether did i like the wrong gur manz..          i know that thoh i may like her so much...and that most likely she wun reciprocate..but that's not the point manz.. the point ish bout me liking the wrong gur notx manz. cos it's likee.. i like her so much..and i trust implicitly in her to not do such stuff..thenz it's like she disappointed me..thoh she didn't promise me anything or wots. this is the part that really got me.. screwed ..cooked manz. i think it's like i like her so much till that i wish that the stealing incident wasn't for real. cos i don wanan like .. fall for the wrong gurr.. cos i trusted her to not do such things.. and furthermore..when i went out with her..she was quite okays.. and cutee.         i guess perhaps it's true like wot she said.. " Don't say you love me " -m2m. "you don't even know me..." --> a phrase from the song. i guess i just don know her that well yet. i am only seeing things from the surface.. cos it's like when she's with her friends..perhaps she's more open and stuff, thus she acts differently..and she acts in a differnt way that i may not accept it.. so afterall i guess i really do need to know more about her. But it's like.. if she doesn't like open up with me or wot..i wun really know much bout her..since im not studying in the same skool as her..and stuffz. and she's like always syaing the same things in sms..That's why i also donno how the heck am i gonna know her better manz..         And it's like... i'm afraid that i may not like her as much.. bc i really do wanna like her with all my heart.. cos.. it's like she's the only gur so far who can like..make me ..totally don even wanna see other gurs at all manz.. and i reeally wanna continue being this manner. Then suddenly out with all these stuff..that's why i'm really confused.. thohts all messed up..i hope god will guide me along..thru eveyrthing.. tell me which is right and wrong..and give me the strength to do so...         i like mC..and i donn wanna like..give up chasing her or wot..cos i wanan know that i have given in my best...no matter wot the result turns out to be..i don wanna like..in the near future see her with another guy..then regret like sh|t manz..yet im afraid that from now onwards my liking for her..will cease to be tt great like b4..          This time, i'm really caught in the middle..i really hope someone would really tell me wot to do manz.. okayz..now it's kinda late..and tml's a skool day ..i guess i better turn in right nowz..         mC...i sincerely hope..that you are not the kind of person i'm thinking you are..   -siGning oFF timE ::: 1.05a.m.
