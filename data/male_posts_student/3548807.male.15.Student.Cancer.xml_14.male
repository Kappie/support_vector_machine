And now i believe because she has already said it that i might as well do it...even though it's pretty damn obvious by these entry's that yes me and emily i believe...are in love...and i'm not sure that i've felt this way about anyone...but she's brought out a side within me that i myself have never even seen. and hopefully we can sit down to actually talk about this more thoroughly but yes...now all of your little talking and giggling at us is over...but feel free to do it some more if you'd like to. Sam
