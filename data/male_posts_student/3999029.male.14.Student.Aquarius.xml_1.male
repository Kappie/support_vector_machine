Many ppl ask me  y I hate Bastard Zhang so much, well, I'll try to answer these questions and more in the entry.    Coach Zhang, 2 very important reasons: Firstly, I don buy much things from her. Tat means that she doesn't coach me as often as the others. That's mistake number one. She should not be so biased to those who don buy a lot of stuff from her.She should treat all the shooters equally since the school paid her to coach us. It is not right to prefer those better ones and develop a liking for them. Secondly, she loves picking on me and always says tat I don train very often and would totally ignore me in training. That's mistakenumber two. I don intend to be in the national team and thus she should force me to. I also have my rights too.    I am not going to grow up and be a professional shooter.Schoolwork is still my priority. Ifeel that I shouldonlyreallydevote myself to trainings in the competition period.Since Zhang    Jahu, one very important reason: he has serious attitude problemsand loves bootlicking, which I dislike very much, and is also the main reason why I hate him so much.These type of ppl are really fuckers andshould be ashamed of themselves. Jahu is so thick headed and seeinghim makes me feel wanna blow up. I especially hate his faceand the way he talks shows that he is a mother fucker who ought to be slapped.    The fight(guess wat it is abt): After struggling in the choas of the fight for nearly one and half years, I finally made some progress. However, ever since the accomplishment, more stress have been pushing on me and I am choking. I will give up this fight at the end of the year and start something new. It is killing me and I can't cope with it. That should end my entry for today. I am down with depression again. I needa long rest.
