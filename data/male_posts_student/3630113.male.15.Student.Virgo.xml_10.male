Some people would know who comes to mind when this notion springs up...lol...it's been a long time since it happened...probably there was a possibility then...we thought he didn't have the guts..obviously he didn't do it...but well...we'll never know if it'll ever happen until the time comes...woah..edmund teo's a really charismatic speaker...he has fantastic diction and is quite interactive with the audience...can tell he's a really good mentor as well...really cool guy man.   Aiya...seriously...we should really watch out for one another since you might never know what may happen...like what i said in my previous entry(i think) we gotta treasure everything that we have that is with us..cuz we never know when they might just disappear some day. Shall not regurgitate everything that edmund teo said...but just to say a little to those outside of tchs and probably those who haven't heard of it...misconceptions are that only insane people and irrational sociopaths harbour thoughts of suicide and it isn't that huge a problem. Well seriously from what i saw it was...the one who gets most hurt is the person who wants to commit suicide...the most prevalent of causes is loneliness...and perhaps ending one's journey of seeking the meaning of life...he just wants to leave...but seriously think of it...when they are here..still with us...they are the most hurt...but after they've left this world...we may probably think that they would hopefully be coping well on the other side...but we know that at the end of the day it is ourselves that hurt the most with the loss of these loved ones and friends. I used to take suicide as something to be ludicrous...'cos i know i would never commit it...but i think now my perception has changed...well perhaps not of suicide...but perhaps of life...whatever it is i'll always try my best to achieve something...if i fail...so be it..i guess...hah...we should live a life happily...we probably only get one chance to live...so once we regret it we'll feel remorse for the rest of our lives...at least i know i tried my best to achieve happiness...i know it doesn't come for granted and it's something that is mutual...=)  Oh well...talking bout people getting hurt...hsien got knocked on the head by my sepak takraw when hien volleyed or sth the ball at his head...and omg...i can't talk much bout it...but it accentuated a previous injury was suffered when he was much younger...now he has some sort of an incapacity...shan't talk much bout it...but seriously we won't know whether it's temporary or permanent...hais...i'm feeling bad cuz i brought the sepak takraw to sch...but of course i didn't expect for such things to occur...zzz...how many times have i got to tell you guys do not vent all your frustration or exert all your energy on the ball...it's only made of rattan.zzz. now it's on the verge of rupturing.zzz. so for all of you guys who read this...pls...do be more delicate with the ball...  won't say it's hien's fault la..accidents are bound to happen...hais. Mr "introvert" hsien was such a lively dude in school..never failing to conjure some magic to inject laughter into the class during times of boredom...he's kinda eccentric at times la...but he's a real nice guy actually...i know that even though i've only known him for bout 1 and a half year or so 'cos there were a few incidents from which we became better friends. He was picking up the momentum(as ang put it) and it's really unfortunate that something like this has happened.hais. Wish him all the best.  Get well soon dude. Hope to see you back in school in no time!  wah...ang came in to return maths test today...when aiks msged me to tell me i got 80 obviously i was quite happy la...budden i realised i was still lower than class average..wth man..class did so bloody well...about 20++ people got 80 and above...woah..i guess it wasn't much to be happy about..so ya..anw..i guess i think i deserved it..chem test today was a total. Couldn't say the same for chinese test though. 100 marks paper within 80 mins...wah...i think most people couldn't finish on time...lots of us were struggling...won't say it's very hard...but some of the basic things that i anticipated wouldn't be featured came out...Percentage composition of air!!!wat the hell!!! and no mcq at all...zzz. wah. i almost died sia...i think i left enough blanks that could result in a 10 mark deficit..crap man..shall hope for the best...chinese test was damn easy...cuz i think i dedicated much effort to studying for it...lol..kinda breezed through la...hehe...  Oh well...still sniffing like crap..the mucus just won't stop coming out...i think there's enough mucus to fill one entire mug...ok i shall not stray towards the gruesome side...argh..but crap...it really doesn't feel good...i wanna just get well soon and get out and play some soccer!!!   ^i'm still waiting.
