That I can't even lift my head up all the time. Other than that, we played horribly. Now I understand what love is...thanks to Adrian. This was what he said,"God wants us to be happiest, and tt can only be when we abide in Him. Thus when we sin, and choose our way, He's sad cos He knows tt we suffer when we sin. This is love. We feel pain cos we dun get what we want. and wat we want often isn't the best for the other person. That's selfishness." How true! Now I understand. Thanks again Adrian! Hope you don't mind me reproducing your words. I'm just tired and stuff. Nothing much these days. Except that my QT is not exactly good. But I'll get back to it. It's the beginning of the holidays, and I already got the tons of homework. So it isn't gonna be an enjoyable time during the holiday. I wanna go out with friends. But I still don't know whether it's possible. Just hope that they'll be ok with it. Really miss them.
