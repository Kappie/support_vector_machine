My organs feel like they are being chewed to bits, and no one can hear my screams. I had a flowering relationship, with the best girl I've ever dated....I was a lucky man, but I ruined it all.... I deserved it. I've never felt this way before.....I'm actually tearing.... I love her so much. DO YOU HEAR ME???? WORLD?????? I LOVE KAYA BEERY!!!!! But....the last I love you I got felt so empty, and hollow....After yesterday I know what it means...I guess it didn't sink in. I feel cold and alone....I have afrog in my whole body, not just in my throat...and its plugging me up entirely.  That was my bit of poetry I guess. Thats how I felt when she said it. It felt like a huge box fell on me....and its infinetly heavy....I won't be able to lift it.   I know it might be a "just a six week thing," but I'm screaming inside.....because when I said to her "I look into your eyes and I see you saying 'I'm sick and tired of this'"  of course she was. WHO WOULDN"T BE????????? I got what I deserved... I feel like I'm falling....my hands are shakijng now....and I can't type very welll.... I love her with all my  heart and soul.  ~Elan B Samuel
