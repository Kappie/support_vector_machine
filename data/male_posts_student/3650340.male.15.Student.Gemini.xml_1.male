Life as I see it is the sunshine of hope even in the darkest hours, Life as I see it is beautiful even like a grave topped with flowers.  Life as I see it is happiness even when everything around is sad, Life as I see it is patience even if you're getting mad.  Life as I see it is forgiveness to even the biggest mistake, Life as I see it is giving even when you desperately need to take.  Life as I see it is smiling even at the toughest of times, Life as I see it is even in a storm, the sweet ringing of chimes.  Life as I see it is a small boat sailing even in the turbulent sea, Life as I see it is thanking and appreciating for friends and family.  Life as I see it is a bird with broken wings, who still dreams to fly, Life as I see it is maybe not always success, but never failing to try.  Life as I see it is only truth and nothing less, Life as I see it  is not perfectly arranged, but not also a total mess.  Life as I see it is accepting and learning not to complain, Life as I see it is silence, for others, even when you're in pain.  Life as I see it and would like others to see it... is a gift, given only once, Enjoy it, live it and use it for people to remember you always..even when death comes.         Tejas
