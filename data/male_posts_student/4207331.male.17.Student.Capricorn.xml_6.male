Water is one of the most abundant resources on earth, and clean water is vital for the survival of humans.  It is so important that the United Nations has gone as far as declaring that access to clean water is a right.  And yet, even with an abundance of water, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reports that “Some 1.1 billion people – one sixth of the world's population – do not have access to safe water.”  This is a problem that needs to be addressed.     According to UNICEF, there is a need for inexpensive and efficient water purification methods.  The Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP), which is a combined research effort of UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO), has gathered data showing that in the least developed countries, 62% of the population has access to water, but only 44% of the population has access to sanitary water. According to UNICEF, each year about 3.4 million people die from unsanitary water conditions.  In fact, the WHO reports that, “Every eight seconds a child dies of a water-related disease.”          Although there are many current solutions for providing sanitary water in developing nations, none of them are able to improve the current situation by a significant amount.  According to the JMP, from 1990 to 2000, the percentage of the population with access to sanitary water has only increased by 3%.    Current solutions are developed to provide sanitary water on a large scale, thus consuming large amounts of resources and energy.  Typically, these solutions rely on filters or chemicals.  Although these solutions require minimal initial cost investment, they require continuous maintenance costs, as well as people instructed to maintain them.  Furthermore, it is difficult to determine the lifespan of these chemicals and filters.  According to Waterwise, a large water filter and chemical manufacturer and distributor, replacing the filters and adding chemicals at the correct time is pertinent to providing sanitary water.  If a filter is used too long, then water run through the purifier will be contaminated without any indication.       Many current solutions also require high levels of power, typically gathered from diesel or propane.  This is another resource, which must be replenished in order to operate the purifier.  In addition, there is not only a high cost for the fuel itself, but also for the shipment of the fuel to the remote locations of the purifiers.  Essentially these purification systems require just as much outside intervention to upkeep the system as it does to install them.  Despite the high maintenance of the current solutions, they are used because they provide clean water at a relatively low cost per liter.  A solution that provides water at the same or lower cost per liter while requiring less maintenance and outside supplies would be preferable.     So, we have a problem.  We also have a proposal for a solution.  This is to make a more-efficient, equally cheap method of water purification which requires little to no consumable supplies.  Our current solution is to use solar energy to evaporate water and then condense it, thus giving us totally pure water.   This solution brings us to another problem.  Anyone who has been outside, even in the Rio Grande Valley, knows that water will not boil in a resonable amount of time from the sun alone.  Our proposal also deals with this issue. In order to boil water at a lower temperature, we plan to create a low pressure system above the water.  This will reduce the boiling temperature of the water, thus making it actually possible to boil water with energy from the sun only.  In addition to using solar energy, our solution would also be able to recieve heat from fire or other sources of heat.  What do we do next?  Our plan of action from here is to solidify our idea by conducting some proof of concept experiments.  These will involve lowering the pressure in a container of water, and measuring the boiling temperature.  From there, we will have to determine whether our method of lowering pressure is viable and whether we will be able to get a low enough temperature.  If we can, then we will work on a design.  If not, it is back to the drawing board.   That's all for now -Ben Salinas
