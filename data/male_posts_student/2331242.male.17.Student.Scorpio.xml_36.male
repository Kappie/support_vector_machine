Martha and I have had some ups and some downs. I practically ruined her birthday, yes, but we still managed to pull together for a  fantastic  Valentine's Day. And by fantastic I mean "holy-shit-what-a-day" fantastic. We're going stronger than we've ever been before, and it's a great feeling.  Today was... blah. Mike and I stayed up until 6:00 AM playing FFXI. Epsilonia is level 19 now, and would be 20 if he didn't keep dying so much... Well anyways at the end of it all I was back where I started before the night began. Go me. I must have drank 10 Cherry Cokes. I logged out in the middle of the game, and passed out backwards onto the futon.  This morning I woke up at 11:00. Mike and I played FFXI  again . Mom called Mike's house and told me to be home @ 2. When I got home, I stared at the wall. I don't think I had ever felt so bored in my life. I didn't really want to play anymore games, but I did anyways. Boredom led to melancholy.  And then Martha called.  I didn't get the usual jolt that I get out of seeing her name on the phone, because I knew that I had been avoiding the world all day. I knew that she knew it too. Our conversation was short but not sweet. She had been calling my cell all day, but I had just then at 3:00 or whatever it was plugged the piece of crap into the wall.  I didn't really feel like going to piano, so instead I went to Jack in the Box. Ultimate cheeseburger, curly fries, coke, oreo shake. *looks down @ stomach* Yup, it was way too much. I put gas in my car, and then I drove home.  I screwed around some more. Got even more bored. Took a shower (never fails to cheer me up, at least a little.) Got out and then checked my email...  ...and smiled.  Martha, I don't know what I used to do in my free time, but it all falls  waaaay  short of a moment spent with you. You're like a drug to my heart. I'm melting just talking about you (again). Thanks for the great e-mail, you just made something out of what would have been a very bad day :)
