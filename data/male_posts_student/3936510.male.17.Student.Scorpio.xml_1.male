This all started on Sat. night when I went to the Abbey w/ Jeremy and Jessica. They called me out of the blue and asked if I wanted to go. Thank God! I said yes! We had been there for a while and not very people were there. It was kind of boring. (BTW I talked about this in a previous entry. If you want more details check it out.) Untill this cute boi walks in. lol Blah! Blah! Blah! The night goes on and #'s exchanged. I got Josh's. I am very glad I did. We talked a few days ago and he told me he would call back and we would set something up about us getting together. I was like "aight." I really didn't think he was going to call. I am not used to people hitting on me. lol Well, he called tonight b4 I went out and I told him I would call back when I got home. He old me he had tried to call me for the past couple days. I was like "hmmm." So I call when I get home. Let me tell you, that was an awesome conversation I had w/ him. I can't explain this boi. I'll just say, I don't hate him. lol I am very anxious to see where this goes w/ him and I. We are planning a date for sometime next week. He is such a kewl guy to talk to. And w/ him hitting on me makes it so much better. Trust me though, I would have hit on him too. Josh: I can't wait for next week.  Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy! What can I say?He is such a great guy. I enjoyed the talkI hadw/ him tonight. We'llhave to do it again sometime. It was so kewl to get to talk tohim about certain things. I think we had a moment. "Tear" lol Nah. Jeremy and I are great friends. And I am so thankful to have that relationship w/ him. I wouldn't change it for anything. Thanx Babe!    Band is good. That's all I need to say. HAHA Band Camp next week. All next week! 8am - 4:30pm Drive by the parking lot to the High School (HONK and SCREAM my name). I would greatly appreciate it. lol
