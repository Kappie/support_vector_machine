FDR wasn't really an attentive father, eleanor a fairly unusual mother.  robert kennedy loved his children so much he would kiss their hands as they walked by, but when the choice came between bringing them up in an air of relative calm after their uncle's assassination or gambling himself for the presidency -- in a dangerous time when they were killing people like Jack and MLK, Jr., and Medgar Evans -- he gambled, and ran.  And he too of course was killed, leaving ten children to be brought up by an overwhelmed mother in a home marked by loss.  Washington is full of people who work at the office late and go in on saturdays and sundays to prepare and argue over child-friendly welfare bills and child-friendly education initiatives and Head Start programs and reading programs for impoverished children.  they are doing good work at HHS and the DoE and in the OEOB.  it is work that is important to our country.  and sometimes at their desks they think of their own children and look up and promise themselves, "next week we'll go on a picnic, or to a ball game."  and their children are home watching tv or pushing a rock with a stick in the driveway thinking, "where's dad?  where's mom?"  washington, of course, isn't the only city this applies to, nor people in politics the only professionals.  my son has pushed that rock with a stick.  maybe yours has too.  this is what professional amibition does:  it takes you into the world and away from your family.  you can make a lot of people's lives better that way, but you can make the lives of those around you worse.  it's one of the great traps, the great strains of trying to make the world better, and i don't mean that ironically....  so, that passage is what i'm trying to sum up about parents.  no kid wants to be that rock pusher.  and no parent wants to come home to see their kids pushing that rock.  my parents have that professional ambition.  and good for them.  but, if you are going to be a professional, learn to balance your time.  i  hope that i can be a professional and a family man at the same time.  i don't ever want to see my kids pushing a rock while waiting for me....  my next entry:  significant others.  that should be fun.  i've been waiting a long to to blog about that.
