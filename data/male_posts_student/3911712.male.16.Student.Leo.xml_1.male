I haven't been outside in two hole days, which is much too long! the reason I haven't been out is, First off, noone's home, so theres no need for me to get up early to go to anyone. And I've been sleeping till 6 pm, so I'm in " sleep mode " till 10 pm. I miss my girlfriend ever so much.. I hate beeing all sentimental :/ I didn't realise I was sentimental untill I met her. I recieved an e-mail from her yesterday. I was so happy, but my e-mail fucked :/ so i had to send the mail like 3 times, I don't know if any of them, or all of them for that matter, got sent. I hope the first one i wrote got sent, that was the one that was the best. I defantly hope I didn't send all three, she'll think I'm stupid or something..   I've been watching a lot of babylon 5 lately, I had forgotten how great it was. I hadn't seen the firsts episodes when i was little, and I've noticed, the mention white stars and "the shadow" a lot! before they both started showing up in the show. I remember in one episode, when two workers where sitting in a window eating their lunch, and one of them mentioned how he thought the white star's all looked like a plukked chicken.    oh well, *End of transmission*
