That's what I felt today after my drunken girlfriend started kissing me in the entryway to our friends' house. Her breath reeking of cheap red wine. "Sure, honey. I don't mind if you stay at the party." What do I get? Why do I stay? Why do I keep offering more? I felt that same sort of eerie alienation a couple days ago when thinking about my future. I have to find something to do with the rest of my life. It's getting harder every day to switch course, and it's not merely psychological: the committment of time, money, energy and the promises I make all hold me to one direction. Yet despite this committment, I couldn't tell you (or myself) what values are most important to me. No - I could  tell  you. I could tell you that equality, compassion, and respect for the earth are what motivate me. Unfortunately, I wouldn't believe myself. I wouldn't even know if I was speaking the truth. What if true self-understanding is the understanding of an absence of self? I feel like I'm looked within myself and found emptiness, and am left with nothing to look to beyond that emptiness. As much as I would like to see this as a mental illness, depression, whatever, I'm worried that the reason I keep coming back to it is because it  is  the truth. Nothingness is the truth: it's what we come from, what we are (mostly) and what we will return to. I don't see this perspective as necessarily bad. I'm familiar with the arguments, the pragmatism defense, the lengths people can go to in order to give their lives meaning. I even know the joy of it.  I'm not depressed, or if I am, I have never  not  been depressed. Maybe I see through the cloth, understand the illusion, and am a lesser person for it.  Soon enough, my girlfriend will come home drunk, and I'll pretend to be asleep so she'll leave me alone. Maybe she's the problem... that would be easier for me. If someone should accidentally read this, please don't give me your pink optimism. You don't go blind from staring too much into the dark. Staring at the sun is another matter.
