Yo Dan, you can not and I repeat CAN NOT go back on the high way on an off ramp *yes, not even if you were goin on reverse!* lol. We picked up a good ol buddy too named Bender while we were lost. Bender is about 5 feet tall, perfect cylinder shaped *well, a lil bent and looks as if it got ran over repeatedly* and he's ORANGE and no, its not an Oompa Loompa, lol its one of those road construction cone that we kinda stole off the road lol. He's in my garage sleeping in a huge cardboard box *I wonder how long it would take my parents to realize that Bender is there*. Yeah yeah, then while we were on the highway, I was kinda bored driving so I let Dan take over the wheel. He was like "DUDE, we're on a highway goin 70 miles an hour and we're switchin seats!!!" ohhhh yeah, that was a shit load of fun lol. Oh yeah, we went to Menasha and skateboarded. I kinda fell on my ass and it hurt like a bitch. Then we got threatened to be fined by a cop because it was past curfew. Oh yeah Dan, from where I was standin, It looked pretty damn funny when you came running and yellin "THERE'S A GHOST IN THAT BUILDING,AHHHH!" lol. Yeah dude, I saw that lights flicked but I was too busy laughin my ass off! OH YEAH, then driving through the park! I left some tire marks on the grass. That was pretty damn awesome. Then I ran a total of 4 and a half red lights *would have been a full 5 BUT it turned green as I was in the middle of the intersection... What a gay ass light*. As we were returning from Green Bay, I had this urge to go Pee so I was gonna pee out the window but my wee wee couldn't go past the window sill soI peed in a plastic bottle and threw it in front of the windshield but unfortunately, the bottle got stuck near the windshield wipers lol. OFF ROADING!!!! AHAHAHAHAHAHA... Yo Dan, I told ya my mom would find those grass stains! lol. Oh yeah and driving with both our doors opened! AHAHAHAHA that was hilarious. Oh yeah, and those girls at George Webbs.... EWWW lol. Oh man that was a great night. I went to bed at 3 a.m. and slept till the afternoon, a few hours later I went to work and Dan you ass white cracker, I cant believe you quit! Work was long and dull. I got home talked online for a lil bit, then I called Wendy *aka my girlfriend*. Damn girl, you sure know how to confuse a guy. I didn't understand what the hell you were tryin to say and it was a simple question! All you had to say was yes or no lol. That was hilarious dude and no I wasn't makin fun of you :-p. You were also bein a stubborn mean ol butt munch lol. I still love you chick. Well, thats about my night and im goin on to bed.
