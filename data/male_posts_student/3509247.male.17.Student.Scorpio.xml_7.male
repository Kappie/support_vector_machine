For some reson I couldn't load web pages, but I could chat on IM (which was constantly kicking me off) and down load files (which were constantly disconnecting).  Bre (a friend of mine) gave me a project to work on.  She wants me to make a CD for her (not my own music of course because I don't make any).  Anyway my dad called SBC because couldn't log on today and they couldn't help him the first time.  He made a "threat" that he was going to switch to cable.  Wether that's going to happen (which would be nice) I have no clue.  The second time he called, they got it fixed.  I'm about to go eat dinner, so I'll post a little bit later.  Bye.
