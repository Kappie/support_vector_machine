On the other hand, there are a few of us who had - in some respects - no option whatsoever, and we've paid for it all our lives.  Somewhere along the way we discover that, even though there were once factors beyond our control, we can exercise a form of personal manifest destiny. Territory that was once claimed by others can be repossessed and restyled as our own, despite lacking the purity of first effort. Perhaps it is just as well. Speaking only for myself, I'm not sure I would have traded any of those choiceless instances; they made me who I am. And even though it's taken most of my 16 years to realize it, who I am the best gift I have to give.  ACTS AND ALL THAT JAZZ!-  I got my ACTS back from the corporate education machine that we have to cater to!-  Okay, overall I got a 23, which ain’t too shabby.  But inside it is my Verbal section I scored a 25, with a 98th percentile in rhetoric.  And a 24 in mathematics and with a 91st percentile in Plane Geometry/Trigonometry!  I take my SATS this weekend!   Batters up! Ehvoy! Ah, baseball.  I love pissing away a day (or evening) at the ballpark, watching the duel between pitcher and hitter, outfielder and baserunner, listening to the crack of the bat....  Frankly, there was a time when I couldn't stand to watch the game, before I played softball and knew the rules and a bit of strategy.  Watching a game makes me think of fishing:  both require an enormous amount of patience to sit through long periods of relative inactivity, but the payoff is often exhilirating.  One of the best parts of a game is people-watching.  There's all kinds at a game, and between innings the camera operators pan the crowd to transmit larger-than-life images via the Diamond Vision screen ... a sort of focused voyuerism.  And, in an odd way, it's a time to feel a part of a community, sitting amongst 50,000 people who -- for nine innings, anyway -- all have something in common.    Oops, my bad.  What was I thinking?  Suddenly, between the fourth and fifth innings, the illusion is abruptly shattered ... the Diamond Vision has become The Kiss-Cam.  Yep, those 20-foot x 20-foot, gazillion-pixel images of heterosexual couples kissing, while being egged on by the hoots and hollers of [nearly] everyone else in the stadium, magnify every queer's role as a second-class human being in a way nothing else can.  Anyone interested in buying season tickets?  Top Ten Rants about Vacation  10. Apparently Florida is a no turn signal state. Unfortunately lots of senior's instead of having theirs professionally removed, break it off leaving it in left turn mode. 9. Florida also has the no smoking ban inside restaurants which I've ranted about before. Several establishments had their smoking "corral" outside of the entrance, where everyone had to cross through a cloud of smoke to get in, instead of sitting in a different section. 8. For the thousandth time, I don't want to buy a timeshare, even if you are offering me cheaper Disney tickets. 7. I-95 is EVIL as in Eastern Vacation Interstate Line. Average speed - 30 mph. 6. Yes, I know it's not even noon. Bring the damned wine list. 5. Kids over five shouldn't be in strollers.......or with pacifiers sticking out of their bratty mouths - if it would keep them quiet, maybe. 4. Mothers shouldn't steer strollers like it's a ride. You don't have to hurl your kid through the crowd to get in line faster (I feel a personal injury lawsuit or two pending - three strollers ran into me and one elderly lady in a motorized cart). 3. Hasn't anyone near Disney heard of an internet cafe? 2. There are more mechanical animals and cartoon characters at Animal Kingdom than there are real animals. and, 1. No cartoon characters groped me (though the elderly woman who ran into me kept trying to).
