I have also been busy with my research this past week. Anyway, I recently saw the 2002 remake of  urlLink Solaris , based on Stanislaw Lem's classic sci-fi novel of the same name.  The movie was actually not as bad as some people made it out to be. In the first place, Lem's novel doesn't lend itself to be made into a typical sci-fi movie. For that matter, Lem's sci-fiction is not typical sci-fiction. But that's another matter, which demands lengthy contemplation (for another time). But what really got me was the soundtrack. I was simply blown away by Cliff Martinez's genius. Martinez must not only be a perceptive reader of Lem's work, but also a master at capturing the atmosphere, the emotions at play when visiting a planet as strange as Solaris. He does an outstanding work of conveying exactly these with his music. And to think I would never listen to electronic ambient music!  There are some other class acts in music I have recently rediscovered for myself. Frank Sinatra, for instance. That voice of his! I have also been listening to soul/blues/funk lately. Marvin Gaye, Al Green, and even Rick James!   "I'm Rick James, bitch!"  Dave Chappelle
