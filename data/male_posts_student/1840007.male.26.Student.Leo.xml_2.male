They were talking to this boy who made Goldeneye and Timesplitters and I kinda thought to myself "ah, could be fun". Ahem.  Well i have less than a hour to do this so i will try my best. Also I think i will put them in order of when i think they came out.    Wizards Lair  - Spectrum     Really I havent played this one in a long time. I think it may be one of my first gaming memories. the Spectrum was the first computer we had which i was allowed to play on (i'm sure i saw Pong in the living room though i don't recall playing it so I always assume from that I was never allowed to touch it) and Wizard's Lair was just this really early game we had, I think it was part of a compilation tape we had or maybe it was something we had copied from someone. Turns out it's something of a classic and I guess I could find an emulated file of it somewhere online but I've been thinking lately of gettig a ne Spectrum for myself. it was a top down shootem up where you controlled this wee guy (maybe a Wizard i'm not sure) who resembled a sort of octopus. it was hard as fuck, well it was one of the first games I had played, and i think the object was to collect all the pieces of a Lion in order to complete but every time you'd start the game they'd all be in different places and if you were lucky one would be in the very first room you start in. I also remember having to fanny around with lifts too somehow. i'd take this for nostalgia.    Speedball 2  - Atari ST     A big big 2 player game, though that won't be much use if I'm on thsi Desert Island on my norm eh? Luckily enough it was a great one player game. this was one of my first Atari St games and it remained one of my most favourites for the whole 2 years i bought games for it for. When yo ulook at it now there are flaws which you woill never find in any of the current waves of sports games such as the fact that when you turn it on and go straight to the 2 player mode both teams are just bare, they all have no stats. Today's football games usually have a selection of teams who each have their own attributes and you can't change them, Speedball 2 made you go through the menagerial side every time. Of course it would be great if you could save your powered up team from the one player game and pit them against your friends. I loved the shiny metallic arenas plus of course the blistering fast speeds the game ran at, when you had a powered up team of course. And nothing was more pleasing than recieving a potential 20 points for injuring one of your hapless oponents, superb.    Super Mario Kart  - SNES     Funily enough one of the games that guy in Retro Gamer picked as well. It's a splendid little game which everyone loves. In fact I'm sure that if there IS anyone else on this island and they find out I have a bag of games with me then they're sure to be asking me if I have this. I actually sold my first copy though because I was a bit bored of it though but it was one of the first games i made sure I bought back then i got my second SNES.    Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time  - N64     I'm including this game mainly because I haven't finished it yet and if I could get rid of all the adventure type games I've bought since then I may actually get round to it. But the great thing about this game is that you know that even after you've finished it you know there is loads more in it you haven't discovered yet.    Street Fighter Alpha 3  - PlayStation     I think I would go as far as saying that this is the most complete version of Street Fighter ever. That is why it is the only one I have included here. Of course I needed to put a SF game in there cos if you know me then you know I love SF something sexy. SFA3 pleases old fans of Street Fighter because all the characters from the SF2 series is in here including all the bosses, the new Super Street Fighters, even Akuma who had actually been in the 2 previous versions of this game. It also has enough new characters to please anyone who thinks that the series offers nothing new, of course it's still ye olde 2D fighting you used to know and love, but that's it you have to love it to stand by it, 3D fighing games are fine and all but I always find that anyone can beat an expert 3D fighter just by pounding the buttons, if you study SF inside out an expert can be uneatable unless he's playing another expert. maybe unfair you may think but it encourages people to actually practice at the damn thing. I havent even mastered all the characters yet, theres bloody loads of them.    Wipeout 3 Special Edition  - PlayStation     I love the WipEout games because they're so damn cool. it's also the rush that you get when you're zipping round each track. The special edition of the 3rd game is the ultimate one because it has a couple of the older tracks in it as well as a couple of "prototype" tracks to unlock. If it's easy to find, the version which comes with Destruction Derby 2 for Â£15 is essential. just stay away from the disapointing PS2 Fusion version.   King of Fighters 2002  - Dreamcast     Just thought I'd put the most recent game i bought in here (well i did this list before i got my 2 new Megadrive games). You can never go wrong with 2 massive 2D fighting games can you? Ok so i may swap this one for another but I feel like I havent explored it all yet, but I could easily have picked Beyond Good and Evil cos I got that recently too and I've barely played it. i also still have to get round to playing Jak 2 and Ratchet and Clank 2.    SSX3  - PlayStation 2     Now what the hell did happen to my Allegra site then eh? This game with it's online play section would last me a while. it's also fun exploring the mountain on your own and completing it 100% with all the characters would take a while. Sublime and totally cool to boot.
