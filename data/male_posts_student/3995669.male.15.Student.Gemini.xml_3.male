Well, today was one of the nicest days I have had ... we went out ona  urlLink yacht  my aunt chartered, which was really nice. The captain took us on a tour of the lake - Lake Norman (not the same area where the dastardly beach is located) - and there are celebrity homes around there, not any "big names" but a lot of race car drivers and sports figures. Then in the middle of the lake we went swimming, which was really nice. Everyone jumped off the top of this two-story boat and landed in the water. It was really fun ... the sensation of falling.     Then we came home, and relaxed a little. The ice cream man came and we got ice cream ... and we started packing and getting around (I was already packed) at about 8. Then we were on the road by 9pm. We drove straight through ... and made it in 7 hours 45 minutes (which has to be a record with kids and dog in car)... the kids slept the whole time so there was no stressful whining, and I was in the passenger seat, and my dad just drove straight through. He wanted me to stay awake to keep him awake though, but then he kept saying "get your rest for tomorrow (today) and then when I'd doze off he'd wake me up "Do you hear the tires ?? We might have a leak." "Are we going the right way ?" (note that there is a long stretch where you drive 300-some miles on the same highway) ... but I stayed up pretty much the whole time. We stopped for gas twice ... and I kept stocking up on  urlLink Red Bull  to get me through !  (UPDATE ... as I am trying to find a Red Bull site to link for in this journal, I am seeing some alarming results !!  urlLink France and Denmark refuse to allow it's sale  except in pharmacies because it has been  urlLink linked to deaths  - some in America. I am upset.)  There is no way I can go to sleep -- I may havea nap of less than 30 minutes. After about 30 or 40 minutes, your body kicks into another phase of sleep, which could mean that if I wake up without having a proper amount of sleep, my body will feel tired because it will be confused. On the other hand, if you have a nap or two (seperated by a good amount of time) that could just boost your energy levels to normal. I am not a coffee drinker, but I think I might have to stop by Dunkin Donuts to grab a frozen thingy, because I am upset about the Red Bull drink death accusations - but I do find it humorous they are considered "hip" to drink in clubs. Also - side-note in case people didn't know: In West Virginia and Virginia and North Carolina, they sell beer everywhere - in mini-marts, grocery stores have wine coolers and stuff sitting right out in the middle of the cheese/milk isle. It's hilarious. Also - another amusing story. At a gas station in West Virginia, there was this wretched male human with foul body odor, and really visibly dirty clothes (the place itself wasn't a dump ...) who was talking to the cashier the entire time we were there, and the cashier was trash, had teeth missing anda black eye, and when my dad got a piece of beef jerkey from the thing up front, the guy is like "those th a ngs are good, 'xcept I spend about 20 bucks a month on them thangs." I found it both disturbing and comical.  Now I am off to get a nice looonnnggg shower ... just stand under the hot water, and take my time getting ready to go to Knoebels today with the family and Ashley. Right now the sun is rising and it's nice and peaceful ... the birds are chirping and stuff. Yeah - it's only interesting for a few minutes. Peace out~!
