I don't like it, but I tolerate it without saying too much.  If any of you smoke or are going to smoke at anytime in the future, besides asking you to quit or not start, I want you to be polite in your smoking.  That's right, be polite! I am not saying that every smoker is rude in their habits.  In fact, many are very polite but it really aggravates me when a smoker has no concern for the non-smoker.  Examples:            At work there are about twelve people at the table, three student workers and a bunch of middle-aged guys.  The older guys smoke, which in itself I don't understand how they are allowed to do in a state building, but that isn't the point.  They smoke a combination of cigarettes and cigars and insist on exhaling in my direction.  In a normal situation like this I would get up and walk away.  However, I can't walk away since I am at work and it wouldn't be appropriate to say anything to them considering both of my bosses smoke like chimneys.  So I sit there, inhaling the carcinogens of the second hand smoke, coughing, and wondering why it would be so hard to blow the smoke the other direction.            Thursday I went out to eat with my dad at lunch.  We went to a little restaurant that has really good food and we are sitting there eating.  In comes an elderly gentleman and he sits down at the table next to us.  What is the next thing that he does?  He lights up, appears to enjoy it and then begins looking around on the table for an ash tray.  Look around old man, no one is smoking in this room, everyone is smoking in the other room, there are no ash trays on these tables, there are ash trays on the tables in the other room.  Is it that hard to figure out that you are in a no smoking area! I mean really people have a little common sense.  I was thinking about asking the waitress to have him move when she saw him.  She told him that he couldn't smoke in there, he got up and moved.  How can you enjoy food while your sucking tar into your lungs anyway?   I apologize to any of you smokers who pay attention to the non-smokers.  People, just use some common sense when smoking.  Do you honestly think the people who don't smoke want to inhale the shit that has already passed through your respiratory tract?  We don't.  I should move to California, smoking in public places is against the law.
