When I was making plans to leave for Rochester, NY (4 long wasted years ago) my friends immediately responded by saying "New York City?? That's great."  No. Not New York City. Rochester, NY.   Moi:  J'attendrai l'Universite de Rochester a New York.   Mon Ami:  New York?? Tres bien! Avec La Statue de la Liberte, n'est-ce pas?  Moi:  Non. Rochester.  Let's face it. There is only one city in New York state and the rest of the state is one big landing strip for jets. Which is why I did not understand why the City of Rochester was up in arms when the "I Love New York" tourism website failed to include a larger feature about the Fast Ferry. The boat is designed to get you OUT of Rochester. OUT. As in, OUT.   Visit Rochester! It's now even easier to leave!    Visit Rochester! We're just across the lake from a real city!   I'll stop there as I am stuck here until August. I don't know why I'm complaining so much. I've been having the most awesome time these last few weeks. Oh well. Stick to what you're good at, right?   3.  I think I registered for the wrong summer class. I don't remember "Stick-Up-Our-Pale-White-Asses 234" being in the summer bulletin. I am enrolled in a class of 7 people, 5 of whom are emotionless, humorless, witless, and might as well be dead. Thank goodness for Nose-Ring Matt. He is as off his rocker as I am and has an appreciation for the absurd. He sits next to me and will be my summer class buddy.    Me:  I used to smoke chicken.  Nose-ring Matt:  I used to smoke cloves.  Me:  That's cool. I use cloves in my cooking.  Nose-ring Matt:  I use chicken in my blunts.
