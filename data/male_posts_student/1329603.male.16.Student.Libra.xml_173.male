So I've done one Sunday and that's it, hopefully... I need to get as much chocolate eating in as I can, though, for the rest of the day, so that I can sustain myself. Jon's going to get faaat. I'm also off to Aroma, tomorrow, with the peoples, which is trés cool.  Actually, I'm feeling so much better now it's unbelievable. I know I have no chance with either of the girls I li(many is)ke, no chance at all (why throw your lives away?), but they're both cool, and at the moment I feel... kind of uplifted in a really weird way. I'm happy because I'm screwed. Not in the American Pie way. I think the mood change might be in the amount of cleaning my room has had (so much Kudos to ma mère for basically clearing out my whole room!) and so the amount of things I'm allergic to in my room has gone down fairly spectacularly. Possibly that's good for my mental state. I'm sleeping a lot better, anyway.  Les Mis went über-well today, apart from apparently the position Olivia and I are in for A Little Fall of Rain is uncomfortable for her, so we're going to try to work out how to do it proper on Tuesday. The thought pops in that me looking forward to hugging her about 4 times while we try and sort it out is INCREDIBLY unprofessional, but I don't mind that too much. I'm not a professional, so I guess people shouldn't expect me to be like one... eugh, emotions suck. Although, what rules is that I got Olivia's MSN account, so I can find out increasing amounts about her. I know little but like much. Which seems unworkable.  It's my last week of sanity next week before I get plunged into a 2-week spell of constant performance. Expect me to be very, very, untalkative and VERYVERYVERY stressed from the 15th of March until at least the 1st of April. Sorry, I can't help what I'm doing.  Inset day tomorrow. Yay!
