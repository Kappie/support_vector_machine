CBS Continuing Coverage of Ronald Reagan's death  (OPEN ON: DAN RATHER AT CBS NEWS DESK)  DAN RATHER Tonight on the CBS Evening News, more continuing coverage of the death of former President Ronald Reagan.  John Roberts goes inside his coffin for an exclusive one-on-one with the former President.  (CUT TO: JOHN ROBERTS INSIDE COFFIN, NEXT TO PRESIDENT REAGAN’S BODY)  JOHN ROBERTS Even the darkest days of the Reagan administration were never quite as dark as it is inside the former President’s coffin, Dan.  Under six feet of dirt, inside a wooden box, but overlooking the beautiful Pacific Ocean, I’m here with the former President, and, somehow, a cameraman’s in here too.  Hoping to get the first words after the final words, from Ronald Reagan.  (CUT TO: DAN RATHER)  DAN RATHER Thanks, John.  Plus, a look at one Senator’s attempt to change the name of his state to Reaganville, to honor the great President.  (CUT TO: INTERVIEW CLIP WITH SENATOR AND REPORTER)  SENATOR All week it’s been gratifying to see people remembering how great Ronald Reagan was, and how he did no wrong.  We want to honor his legacy by changing the name of our state to Reaganville.  REPORTER But aren’t you from the state of Washington?  SENATOR Yes.  REPORTER Named after *George* Washington?  SENATOR Your point being?  (CUT TO: DAN RATHER)  DAN RATHER All that, and pictures from inside Ronald Reagan’s small intestine, on the CBS Evening News.
