There was not a real conclusion but it did bring up an intriguing question: what would the ultimate sports video game soundtrack be compiled of?  Well I’m glad I asked myself that question (ESPN asked a similar question and  urlLink here  is their take on it).  While I was driving home yesterday (only 1 hour and 15 minutes yesterday) I began to think what the ultimate collection would include and whether or not I should have regulations governing my picks.  I considered the following policies (not as clever as  urlLink others  but it will have to do).   The list cannot include country music.  I realize that there are people that listen to country and enjoy football.  But what sport is usually associated with country music?  That’s right… urlLink NASCAR .   Racing is built upon country music and vice versa.  During my country phase in junior high I remember seeing numerous country music videos shot with NASCAR stars or the location of the video was on a racetrack.  I am not against country music, but I do not feel it is the appropriate music for a sports video game.  Personally, I do not want to hear the  urlLink Dixie Chicks  start singing away when  urlLink Marty Booker  scores a 55-yard touchdown.  (On an aside,  urlLink Kid Rock  does not count as country.  Yes, he does have a country twang to him at times and he loves rolling with old school country artists, but for this arguments sake he is defined as (Kid) Rock.  Besides, I don’t think any country artist would have a chance with Pamela.  She has too much of a history including Tommy Lee.  That is definitely anti-country.)  The song must have a great catch and/or hook.  How else can you explain the rise of such wonderful hit as  urlLink Who Let the Dogs Out ,  urlLink Whomp! There It Is , and  urlLink C’Mon ‘N Ride It (the Train)  at sporting events.  Mind you, none of these will be included in my list, but the reason these songs became popular is the simple fact they had a hook that can be played within 20 seconds and give the sensation that you heard the entire song (which you basically had b/c they repeated the same line over and over and over and over and over and over again).  Plus, a great hook makes people, players, coaches pumped for the play that happened or is going to happen.  The song must not have been used by Madden.  This one has thrown kinks into creating the list, because Madden 2003 and Madden 2005 both have songs I would easily put on the list.  But by having the song previously on a game it plays with my mind and takes away my objectivity.   In essence I have been  urlLink conditioned .   So now that I have explained my selection process I will post my song selection on my next post (sorry if this resembles the results show of American Idol…I just want to make sure I present the best songs possible).   All the excitement of the song selection has limited my time on speaking on the Olympics.  This is probably for the best though, because my interest is waning.  I cringe every time I hear about the USA basketball team, and I have seen my 4-year allotment of gymnastics.  I would like to tell you I am intrigued by the Track and Field events but there has been too much drama and not enough big names that I can connect with.  Oh well…Go  urlLink Phelps !
