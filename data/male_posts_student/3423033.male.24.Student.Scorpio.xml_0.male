It started of with a young Obi wan and Anakin being killed by these weird ass aliens that were like giant slugs. Some had human form, some more disgusting, some that branched out like crazy ass vines made out of slug.   Me and the others (I forget who) were running around being attacked by these things, some being eaten by the monsters. We had killed some ourselves, but they outnumbered us. We found the boss slug, and on a chance, fed it a young baby slug. For some reason this started a reaction that hurt it, but not killing it all the way. We learned that the ones that had a human form, if injured badly, would attack the boss when given food. Thus, we won.  Move on to a mall in TX. I was there to check to see if I got my job in Austin or not. Along the way I had lunch with the old guys from the refinery. The mall was VERY colorful when I was there. Lot's of bright lights, I remember lots of red for some reason. I never did check to see if I got that job.
