Da bunny is going off to Arkansas School of Math and Science. If you haven't heard of such a High School it's for really smart people. Da bunny was first in 10th grade class so he is packing up shop and is gonna go to that High School. Everyone that knows da bunny wishes him the best of luck in life. Post a comment if you want to comment about da bunny leaving.
