Why am i still liking her , i must try and stop liking her cos she now belongs to her soulmate Mark. i cant have these feelings for some one whos taken . Im trying not to. she does'nt have the same feelings for me as i do for her. I just want to get away from everything, wantto get away and start all over again.   My lifes not going the way i want it to, not even in the slightest bit . im F**ked. I cant stop mssing her. These weired feelings. Get up and live ina daze, i dont want it to be this way C .Life feels empty.
