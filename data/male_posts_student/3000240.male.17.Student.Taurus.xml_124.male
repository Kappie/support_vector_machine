He or she will be deemed "Voice of a Generation," and grief-stricken fans will hold candlelight vigils and anniversary memorials for years to come."  Above:  Michael Abernethy, "The Real Significance of Kurt Cobain "  Every April, the floodgates are opened; millions of enduring Nirvana (especially Kurt Cobain) devotees privately and publicly express their equally enduring gratitude for the late pioneer of not only the grunge genre but an altogether unique approach to musicianship, rock performance, and dare I say, life itself.  But the clichés have been reported since 1994 (perhaps earlier), and each year the response is the same: Kurt Cobain was indeed an icon, a visionary, a heroin addict, and a scrawny 20-something-year-old.  Where does that leave the passionately loyal, if diminished, audience still bent on maintaining his legacy?  According to Michael Abernethy, author of the aforementioned PopMatters column, "The Real Significance of Kurt Cobain," a cycle of icons will continue with each generation: "[L]egacies change over time.  When one icon passes, someone else steps in to fill the void, even as music buyers of one generation grow up, and the next generation finds someone new to represent their particular concerns."  The unfortunate reality is that Nirvana was part of a finite generation, one that would either fade with the band's unexpected dissolution or the natural passage of time and fickle music fans.  Nevertheless, the grunge era was indeed cut short.  Now, only one day of the year is specifically dedicated to an artist and human being who struggled, survived, and even died on a daily basis.  Why have we disengaged ourselves from his life?  Is it the fragmentation of the current late teens to mid-20s generation, the supposed need to fit oneself into a "distinct" community, whether it be based on fashion, music, or crack?  Is it the decayed state of alternative music, molded in part by the increasingly popular hipster sub-culture of independent music?  Or is it just laziness on the part of young eyes and ears, an audience corrupted by a bite-size attention span and a lust for whatever might be cool?  A disease usually has multiple symptoms, and this diagnosis is no different, but my particular concerns of alternative decay, unconscious fans, and divisive sub-culturalism are the primary ailments.  In a post-MACHINA II interview, Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins, Zwan, and now just himself laments the loss of the alternative community: "The idea of the integrity, the idea of what it means to be in a band, the idea that you have to walk right and be right because you got to stand up not just for yourself but for your community — that's all gone, that’s just out the window."  In the fallout of such noteworthy acts as the Pumpkins, Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, and Soundgarden, a trend within the alternative circle cropped up as certain members of the aforementioned bands joined together to continue the march: A Perfect Circle and Audioslave are two of the recent media-termed supergroups to include hallmark musicians.  Additionally, current acts Radiohead and Tool continue to create.  With such bands recording and touring on a relatively consistent basis, one would consider modern (or rather postmodern) music to be more than just alive and breathing.  Yet, it is undeniable that Audioslave is no where near the significance (yet?) of its two predecessors.  Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters may be a solid enough group for popular listeners, but there is no doubt that his previous role casts far too big a shadow upon any future projects.  And the Pixies' recent touring and newly released material?  While the nostalgic sensibilities of 80s and 90s alt-fans are already roused, what is the band returning to?  Certainly not the musical climate of their prime years.  Same goes for Fountain of Youth drinkers, Sonic Youth, who are impressively looming upon twenty albums.  Nevertheless, Sonic Nurse is preparing us for their approaching finale.  It comes down to an observation of the past two decades and, more importantly, the past few years.  Yes, Morrissey's You Are the Quarry is incredible, but much like Sonic Youth, the Smiths vocalist is no sapling (he's hitting 50 in a few years).  Although it is not too late — nor is it ever — to begin buying past records of vital artists, the surrounding community is no longer together.  When Tool releases their next album in 2005, it will be one of the few important reminders of just how high alternative music was a decade ago and how low it has sunk since.  Alternative music's slow decay cannot be simply attributed to aging artists however; the other side of the equation — the audience — is an equally necessary component.  Enter cultural fragmentation: musical genres have long served as tangible indicators of personality, as well as carvers of popular trends.  MTV's video countdowns are essentially indoctrinations of cool, the popular music the popular people are downlo... or rather buying, since online file-sharing is an extinct beast (sure, RIAA). Even the sub-culture of hipster-independent music is being dug up by MTV's Advance Warning; the underground caverns are seeing much more light these days (Pitchfork Media receives 80,000 visitors a day and 500,000 a month).  Hip music listeners have discovered that TRL attendance is not as necessary as owning that indie debut no one else has even heard of.  Knowledge is cool, right?  As much as sub-cultures shift and re-align, fragmentation and division will continue to permeate youth generations.  Specifically, independent music has long been regarded as an inherently exclusive club, its members pompous know-it-alls of those bands far outside the mainstream.  After all, it is cool to own The Notwist's Neon Golden — that is, until your neighbors start listening as well.  Is this musical superiority complex justified for those ardent fans who do research a band's cryptic metaphors, memorize the lyrics, attend multiple shows on the same tour (and perhaps help load the band's amplifiers into what could be called a piece of abstract metal art with wheels), and attempt to actually understand and utilize the aforementioned band as a potential source of inspiration for their own lifestyles, whether it be in painting, politics, or just moseying around?  The distinction lies in both the artist and the audience, and this is where alternative begins to shine more brilliantly than any rock genre.  Nevermind.  The commercial apex of Nirvana's career.  On one hand, an expansive opportunity for millions of people to experience what the grunge underground had already discovered since the band's 1989 debut, Bleach.  On another, the boiling point of Nirvana's publicity and mainstream popularity, fueled by a single millions moshed to but barely understood.  But who really cared anyway?  Kurt Cobain was onstage smashing his guitar and huddling into a corner!  Cool, right?  There is performance art and there is suffering; both appeal to an audience, but only one stops when the lights return.  An audience's interaction with an artist's output is an emotive exchange between the two parties, one determining the extent of the artist's significance and the depth to which the audience attempts to honestly see the artist.  It is easy to simply idolize and adore, perhaps too easy.  The current realization of fandom is based on a hierarchy, the artist situated above the audience as opposed to on an equal plain, an equal level of exchange.  Imagine if the original intention of a fan was not to be entertained, roused, or disturbed but simply inspired to tangibly apply the energy of the art to the fan’s own work.  If a generation's premier artists are considered links in a larger historical chain, the audience will realize its role in perpetuating that chain.  Alternative music has historically constructed itself as a sequence of diverse links, from British post-punk to American guitar rock.  There's a signature style to alternative, an awareness of the importance and responsibility invested by being in a band and writing certain songs.  Ian Curtis knew it, Kurt Cobain knew it, and Maynard James Keenan knows it today.  While none of those artists stuck to their underground scenes, each carried an undeniable significance; independent is by no means a determinant of alternative.  A dozen vague notions can be used to describe the worth of alternative, but it simply boils down to an altogether different way of approaching music: not just as a career, or even a lifestyle; just about every popular band claims to "do it all for the music."  It is the depth to which one will go to achieve an ordinary life amidst extraordinary circumstances: fan idolization, millions of dollars, and tours across the globe.  It is the sincerity and consistency of communication one is willing to make with his/her audience — an exchange as opposed to a lecture.  It is art-centric as opposed to artist-centric or even audience-centric.  It is art for art's sake, a form characterized by distinct aesthetics and particular ideals — music as a tool of consciousness, a method of living, playing, and working — and those ideals are what define alternative as a music genre, a mindset, and a worldview.  Where has independent music gone wrong then?  As with many genres — including alternative — images of the typical artist and fan emerge.  A list of ways to be "alternative" is compiled.  It becomes more of a societal decision than a personal one, and cultural division inevitably erupts over who is truly "alternative."  The same thing has happened to gothic and punk ethics; the question of sincerity is raised, and no one is willing to compromise.  While punk is historically rooted in its earliest pioneers, independent music essentially has no roots; it is literally defined by the band being on an independent label.  It is only through modern characterizations that indie music has taken on cutting edge connotations and rebel art aesthetics: "Yes, we are on an independent label, and because of that we are inherently better than that major label artist."  It is part of the often fragile youth resistance to corporate control and multinationals; not only is it difficult for any kid to grow up in America without tapping into the capitalist vein, but it is ridiculous to claim that independent labels somehow fight the already-present conglomerates (offer frequently more liberating contracts, yes, but not fight).  Because "indie" has become a misguided synonym for "brilliant" to many similarly misguided listeners, alternative music is at a loss: is it possible to express that integrity discussed by Billy Corgan when on a major label?  Obviously so, and assuming a band takes complete creative control — which it should — over its music, artwork, and tours, the label has nothing to do with a band's ability.  While independent labels are important caretakers of emerging artists, the unfortunate disadvantage is one of access.  The indie underground is an infamously private sector, and many fans are simply unaware of promising bands working towards greater exposure.  The fight should not be one of fan access but rather artistic control under a major label; if a Capitol Records band — such as Radiohead — can retain total authority over its output, their statement can be made to a broader audience.  True, the fan base will increase, inevitably pooling in trendy fans who appreciate a band (take MTV's alternative pet, Coldplay) as long as it is hip, but indie music as an exclusive genre as opposed to a stepping stone is only a divisive example of generational fragmentation.  Many of the premier alt-rock artists of the 80s and 90s were by no means indie bands throughout their careers.  They often began in underground scenes, drawing from their respective cities, but an honest band understands the natural diffusion of music, the locomotive quality of expanding art and not restricting it to an audience based solely on geographic or socio-economic access.  Before I step off my soapbox, I want to clarify something: I by no means hate independent music or its role within popular culture.  I just know that in 1993 Siamese Dream was released, and I had no idea.  Yes, I was eight years old, but still... there's something remarkably sad knowing that I was alive when Billy Corgan was striving for that fabled integrity, but I was just a grade-schooler, unaware and uncaring.  Kurt Cobain died the following year, and once again, I was in a classroom at St. Michael School, unaware and uncaring.  I have no doubt that alternative music meant something more during the late 80s to mid 90s, and I am hoping that the cliché of history repeating itself does in fact hold some truth.  Alternative, much like punk, is an ethic all by itself, a lens of perception, a way of thinking, and a general understanding.  It is not just a music genre, and my hope is that more bands understand that broader connotation of rock n' roll.  I sincerely believe it is worth it. xBuBzx
