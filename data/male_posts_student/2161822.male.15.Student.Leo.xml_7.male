Just kidding. I'm just a regular joe. You know, the kid that nothing ever exciting happens to and the kid who just zones out every chance he can get. That's me. Only somewhat exciting thing....well somewhat.... is that I'm in a band. If you want more information (which I know all 2 people who look at my Blog want to), go  urlLink here . Another good site is my friend Neil's website,  urlLink KindergartenBabble . Good humor, good pictures, good food, and a good time altogether. Go to both of those site's if you are bored and even if you are not. Well I'm done with my entry for today since I just remembered I have a History test tomorrow. LATER.
