You could just here that smidge of sarcasm couldn't you? Well as Frielfer says where have you all gone??? I longed for a bit of a chat with you all after my holiday but that wasnt to be, Iv only spoken to a few of you properly. Anywho the dog with two heads and two bodys is knocking on my door and if I dont answer it now he may eat the hob goblin who also needs to speak to me. Fairwell my chummies and I bid thee good night.
