I had a great time at the beach with jessica and her family over easter break.  there were a few times in there where it ended up getting kinda boring (what can u expect when u are with older ppl lol) but overall it was good.  poor jes though, she got worn out easily on this trip, i wish i could have given her some of my energy so we could have gone and done more but o well it was still great fun.  She did get a hole in one twice haha oh and i got some cute beach pics too! ok buh bye for now :)
