I give you  "Friends"  Phoebe: If you buy a mattress from Janice's ex-husband, isn't that like betraying Chandler?  Monica: Not at these prices.   Rachel: I use my breasts to get other peoples attention.  Monica: WE BOTH DO THAT.   Rachel: Hey, just so you know: it's  not  that common, it  doesn't  "happen to every guy," and it  is  a big deal.   Ross: How's Monica?  Phoebe: She's calmed down a bit. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.  Ross: How's the hair?  Phoebe: I'm not gonna lie to you Ross. It doesn't look good.  Joey: Can we see her?  Phoebe: No, your hair looks too good. I think it would only upset her.  Rachel: Oh.  Phoebe: Ross, you can go on in.   Ross: Every week a TV Guide is delivered to Joey and Chandler. What is the name on the magazine?  Rachel: Oh it's Chandler Bing. Him. Right there.  Monica: No.  Ross: Actually the correct answer is "Chanandler Bong"  Chandler: Ms. Chanandler Bong.   Ross: What is the name of Chandler's father's all male burlesque review?  Monica: Viva Las Gay-gas.  Chandler: Unfortunately, that would be correct.   Ross: What? No. What - what are you doing? GET OFF MY SISTER.   Minister: Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily. Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...  Ross: I Ross...  Minister: Take thee, Emily...  Ross: Take thee, Rachel... Emily.   Phoebe: They don't know we know they know we know.  Chandler: Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in High School?  Joey: No. I had sex in High School.   Monica: Fine! Judge all you want to but,  [points to Ross]  Monica: married a lesbian,  [points to Rachel]  Monica: left a man at the altar,  [points to Phoebe]  Monica: fell in love with a gay ice dancer,  [points to Joey]  Monica: threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire,  [points to the box Chandler's in]  Monica: livin' in a box!   [Ross enters, after just getting engaged to Emily, Joey hums the wedding march] Joey: dum dum dum dum--- Phoebe: Oh the Olympics..  Rachel: All right this may sound a little hasty, but just go with it. Why don't you and I get....married?! *haaaa*  Oh Friends..and those are only like..a one part of the infinite comedy that is..Friends. AHHH!!  g'night.
