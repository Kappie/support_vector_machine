There's no comics up, there's a ton of broken links, but we're here. BlackMage is the creator, as he said. Takkun is our resident webmaster, so where do I come in? When BM is busy drawing comics and Takkun is busy making the site nice and pretty, I'm the one keeping you in the loop about the going ons of Oddville, as well as updating site features and handling the PR stuff. You got a question, it comes to me. Have a comment for BM or Takkun? I'll give it a quick run over and forward it to whomever. Spammers and flamers bewear, you gotta get by me first. I shall nobely sarifice my inbox to deal with you people, the Internet.  There's more to come!  FillerKori out...
