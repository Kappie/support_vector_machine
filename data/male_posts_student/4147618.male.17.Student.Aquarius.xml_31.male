On  Saturday Aug. 7, 2004  we had a mission that needed to accomplished and that was making the CRIB!  Ofcourse somethings went wrong when trying to construct an object; im not going to say any names; but hey im just human, i make mistakes too!  Well after jiju got that out of his system we got right back to work.  We had no time to spare because the Mama's had to hurry back home.  HAHA.  So we waited for Dolly didi to arrive home so she can also help with the crib and then with the finishing touches we completed this unbelievable task.  Actually it was quite simple because there were only like 10 screws to put in.  Then the time finally came.....the crib was done and we got treated to Goodberrys.  Ive never seen a papa get so excited over ice cream. HAHA. Just kidding jiju.  Now the only thing missing in that crib was baby   RIA  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  love, the fun  Mama  ( Angad )
