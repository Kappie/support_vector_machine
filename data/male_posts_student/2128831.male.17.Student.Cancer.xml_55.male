I think this fear is really my fear of what I could do to destroy what is here if I got angry enough. I’ve had experiences in the past when my rage grew pretty quickly, but I was able to recognize that and prevent myself from acting it out physically on something or someone (well, at least for the brief stint when I was a kid during which I just wanted to beat the shit out of my brother in any given moment, it seemed). I think there's this pent up anger that's been gurgling beneath the surface for most of my life. When I was younger there were many times that I was emotionally hurt by how others treated me, but I never revealed that to anyone. It seems that my hurt turned into anger at some point because it was pent up for so long. Perhaps a more accurate way to describe it is that what felt uncomfortable may have accumulated to a point when, as a matter of survival, it had to come out in some way, and that way is described as rage, an uncontrollable explosion of energy, as if my body was like a spring and just before it reached its load capacity due to the things placed upon it (uncomfortable feelings), instead of failing, it saved itself by forcing off the load in one explosive uncoiling. I think as a result of this pent-up-ness, there is also the quick-strike reaction towards anyone that I think is trying to control me. I suppose that because deep down I feel suppressed already because of the load of past uncomfortable feelings, that I am pretty quick to interpret another's actions as controlling, and if they are in fact controlling, to exaggerate them, or at least react to them in an exaggerated way. It seems my own morality (which I really believe I was born with) has worked against me. In other words, I have this sense that people should be friendly and kind to each other. So when I feel that I am upset at someone because they treated me in an unkind or unfriendly manner, I keep that to myself because I feel it would be unkind or unfriendly to expose my uncomfortable feelings to them. I assumed, I suppose, that what I felt would somehow rub off on them. or, and perhaps a more likely scenario, I felt that I would be ridiculed for how I felt and didn't want to feel even more hurt because of that ridiculing. I suppose the basis for my uneasiness towards living (which, interestingly enough, doesn't happen when I dream... curious that is... except that lately, since just before the Iraq war, I’ve had dreams that the war would come here and everything as we know it would be destroyed, and those experiences created real intense feelings of fear and sorrow while I was still dreaming, which is very rare since almost always my dreams don't have any emotional content whatsoever)... As I was saying, I suppose the basis for my uneasiness towards living is that I have this fear of being myself fully because I feel that part of myself can really destroy someone or something and I have somehow linked that up with doing just about anything because I don't want to react in an uncomfortable way towards whatever anyone or anything might do and thereby adding more uncomfortable feelings on top of what's already there beneath the surface. I sense that there also is the deep sense of sorrow that we all can't be another way, that hurt really has to be a part of all this. I’ve tried to rationalize it away with different theories, such as, reality is what it is, and it's only my story about it that makes it hurt. And perhaps that's right.  Perhaps I carry a lingering hurt that my parents didn't stay together, that I didn't get to know my father when I was a kid or all the abuse I was subjected to. Perhaps that's really the sorrow I feel.  Yet, as I got to know more about him as I grew up, I realized that there was much I didn't really prefer to be around.  So perhaps it's really the missed opportunity of getting to be around him as I grew up and well the abuse is it just that abuse; however that may have turned out.  And yet, as I’ve recently read in astrology writings, the "missed" opportunity may have created a new opportunity for me to learn to be self-reliant, which really has seemed to be an important need of mine throughout my life. But I’m not sure that that's what I really wanted. It's true, I shun away from relying on others, but perhaps that's really because I don't want to experience their nonacceptance of me because I think it will really hurt me. And if I really think about it, I really do rely on quite a few people to get what I need or want in my life.  I suppose that a truer statement would be that I shun away from other people for emotional support. As I’ve reflected on my life the last 5 years or so, it seems that I react to life's situations based on the feeling I feel as I react to them. So to me it has seemed that I do everything based solely on a comfort-discomfort scale, because everything that I can attribute as being the initiator of my actions, including those sparks of intuition, creates a feeling within me. I suppose what would be beneficial would be to not move through life according to what I feel, in other words, to not use what I feel as my compass in life.  So naturally the question becomes, what compass, if any, do I use?  Perhaps the answer is another question: why do I even need a compass, why follow anything? Of course I wonder if that's really even possible.  Perhaps it really boils down to looking at what really is going on here in this reality, what exactly is my experience of it, that is, what really is that experience as an entity in itself?  Of course I wonder if even that is really possible. But perhaps the reward is in just the trying of such a thing. But that will have to wait till another day.
