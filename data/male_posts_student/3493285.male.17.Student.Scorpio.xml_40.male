PLEASE DONT MAKE ME GO! so basically i'm just going to have to work a little bit harder and try and pick things up a little bit faster. interesting.  do you think that you have control over your emotions? it proposes an interesting question for myself. today i tried to hold in whatever else i was feeling and convey complete and utter happiness. before i knew it, that feeling took over and i couldnt even really register anything but being really happy. it was quite bizarre. but you know, i'm not sure that this is completely possible. i dont think that we have control of our emotions all the time. maybe because for reactions that our own body has, chemicals and what not, i dont think that we can control it all the time. i think for the most part we can, but as a whole i'm not quite sure we do.  i'm trying to compile my top 10 favorite songs of all time. it's quite difficult. so far i have: Magicstick by 50 Cent--wait wait, let me explain. there's a LOT of memories and good times attached to that song. i'm not straight up thuggin...yet. HOLLA  Desperado by the eagles--pretty self explanatory.  then i'm at a loss for the next 8, because well there are way too many great songs. any ideas?   i think that now i am going to go workout at the gym with mr ian jake daggett. have a wonderrrrful night.
