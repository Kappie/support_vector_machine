It's not to bad; the little kids are good, but when you get to fourth and fifth grade it's time to bring out the whip. I have mucho grande child herding skills under my belt, two little brothers the same age, and I helped with Sunday school for two years at my older church. There is a fine line between being overly nice, resulting in anarchy; and being horribly mean, which results in tyranny. Which isn't all to bad, but then they don't obey you until actually move towards them threateningly. Some people find a small niche in the middle of that line, and they can control people firmly, but be a popular person at the same time. For instance, if i said, "you need to sit here, ok?" and they do it without question. That's the niche every child herder looks for. I was offered to go to a game night tomorrow night, but I don't think i'd be able to participate in anything. I stayed up way to late last night. Then i only got 5 hours of sleep. urk. I was very tired. So I got home and passed out on the couch. Great experience. I didn't really pass out...it was a figure of speech. The grand finali is friday night at 6:30. At TBC's old building. Now Memorial Bible Church. Finally, the thing i won't enjoy the most week is raking my entire back yard. Oh joy. Dead grass litters it, so i go out to rake it all in. Still have to do it, but it's really hot right now. I'm doing it in heats..hehe, heats? Heats as in a race heat, a heat as in it's hot heat. Man, that heat must be getting to me. Oh well, time for the third heat. I'll come back and post some even more corny jokes later. Chaio!
