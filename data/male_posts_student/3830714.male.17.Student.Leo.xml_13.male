The school is so generous that they donated 150+ t shirt to the old folk which my class went to! Although the crowd for the mini carnival was below out expectation, we sure did have some fun. Here are some of the picture taken during the mini carnival:   urlLink    Bellie baloonie...   urlLink    ballie boloonie and hoo lala...   urlLink    Hoo lala stall... Free balloon!!!
