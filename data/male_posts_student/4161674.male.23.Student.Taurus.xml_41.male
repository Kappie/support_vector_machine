It was so unbalanced that a snowflake could have landed on the driver's side and flipped the whole thing on it's roof. It wasn't like the parking lot at Outback Steakhouse was full or anything. It was just like someone decided that they wanted to park as close as possible to the restaurant. Silly driver. I realize that commercials show SUVs doing impossible things like driving up a sheer cliff face, sloshing through raging rivers, or flying through hyperspace. But precariously perching one side of a vehicle on a giant snowbank is just a bad idea, no matter what impression Madison Avenue has given you!
