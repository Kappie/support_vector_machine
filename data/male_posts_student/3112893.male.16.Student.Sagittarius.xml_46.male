It's been a while since I've had some, must be approaching two or three months now. Anyway, I think I'm gonna go find a place to order a good filet o' salmon after the 9th or so.  I take the SAT tomorrow morning at 8. I actually forgot that people did stuff when it was 8 other than take midnight leaks or eat midnight snacks or fight incessantly over whether it's wrong to cheat on your spouse right outside your friggin' room which is divided only by the thinnest of plywood and some whitish paint. I'm looking forward to it in a way, and really dreading it at the same time. Well, I guess it comes down to this, and if not this, to November and if not November, next year. My life is bigger than this test, so it won't end if I do less-than-par on it. It will just disappoint me and wish I studied more. But would I ever do anything about it?  PFFT!! NO! That would defeat the purpose of... not umm... WHATEVER!    Moving on, today was good. I followed all the directions.     1. Relax    2. Don't cram    3. Relax    4. ... Uh...    4. ... Relax.  I followed all the steps and for relaxation I figured out how to play a bunch of songs on my guitar and beat Pillar of Autumn, Halo, and The Truth and Reconciliation levels of Halo on Heroic. It's actually easier than I thought it would be. Those invisable sword dudes are a real bugger though. And the entire time I was listening to either Modest Mouse, Built to Spill, or The Get Up Kids.  Let's see... what else did I do today? I ate some chips and a chicken sandwich and some twizzlers... Oh, I also took a shower and brushed my teeth... made my bed... Ah, I also played a bit of SC this morning.  So yeah, my day was very relaxing. Boring, but relaxing... kinda. :-)  I am tired. I must get to sleep now so that I wake up at a reasonable hour for the test.  That is all.         -- Feanor.
