I'm on the side of the Taiwan nationalists, which both Lien Chan and a-bian are. But I am more for Lien Chan's approach towards this issue. Besides, during the time when Chen Shui Bian was in office, Taiwan's economy has been down, together with the relationship with China. Imo, he has caused much dissatisfaction esp. with foreign countries over the handling of the China issue. I definitely think Lien Chan would do a better job in this area as well as in the economy. Well, I have not much expertise on the taiwanese elections. But I hope the Malaysian outcome would be good. Hope the BN would win and take back Trenggannu as well as hopefully to wrest some Kelantan state seats from PAS.  I went out with Chin han and Woon Han today, I WAS ITCHY ALL OVER, must be something I ate, very gao wei man, in the train with the itch all over, can't wait to get home, but after I slept and then woke up, its ok, think its some allergy of some sort. Other than this, my day was pretty uneventful. My essay on Secularization is less than halfway through, but I can tell its gonna be long............
