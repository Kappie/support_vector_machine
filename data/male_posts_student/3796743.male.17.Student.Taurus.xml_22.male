But its cool, cause my grandparents are super dope...ya gotta love em. They're here for the next week...we are going up to Canada with em in a few days (not too excited to go to Canada...I don't think I really fit in..if ya know what I mean {I'm an American, if ya don't know what I mean}). So yeah, after we picked em up at the airport we went into Portland and went to Lloyd Center so that my mom could buy a honey baked ham...which is according to my mom and grandma..."the best ham your $50 bill can buy" yes folks, a fifty dollar ham..and you don't even get the whole thing...but thats cool cause I've never bought a fifty dollar ham, and now I have. My life is that much better. Oh yeah, and I had forgotten how cool Lloyd Center is, I haven't been there for like a whole year and their Gap store is even bigger than Southcenter's store...which makes everything great in my book. So yep, bought a ham...and you know...anything else that made me happy...and took off for Oly-town. Oh yeah...I almost forgot...my grandma has one of those handicapped things for your car...so for the next week I get to park in the handicapped spot! Oh Yeah! that totally made my day at the mall today! Its the best ever, she said she would let me buy it off her. oh yeah! Well, after getting home and eating my lovely ham we went to see the fireworks that they do every year in Lacey at Sears. They are usually very good fireworks even compared to California fireworks...but this year they blowed...serious...not too good...I was not impressed...so that sucked. Oh well, what a day...I'm off to go watch Saturday Night Live and go to sleep. Good night all.
