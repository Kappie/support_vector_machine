Its now up to God to do the posting for me.. Yesterday was a major Sh*t day. Apperently.. they knew abt sugar and waited til the "appropriate" time to ask me.. Which definitely was not yesterday. They made use of the fact tt i traded Hps wif sugar for 1day to accuse me of everything. Which of course, made me pissed off. And they were so headstrong tt they didnt bother to listen to anything i argued abt.. but kept on sayin tt i just went in circles.. Fine.. i shut up for the whole of the night and let em talk all they wanted.. the main objective for them was to find out who sugar was... i would have told them if they were nice. But they employed a wrong technic to dig the truth outta me.. too bad.. even if i wanted to tel them.. i dont now. its on purpose. nothing muach is gonna change, execpt that i see them as big imbeciles who try to tackle me in a rugy match but cant.
