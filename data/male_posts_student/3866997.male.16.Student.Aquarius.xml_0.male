The portly young lady could stand for no more She grabbed his cojones and went for the door They got to her house and dimmed all the lights Spicy was in for one hell of a night He said that he loved her, he'd always be true "But Mr. McHaggis, I only just met you!" By now he saw double through his drunken eyes Neither had looks or appropriate size He came to his senses, thought to himself "At this time of night I won't find nothing else" He took off his shirt She lifted her skirt They pulled out his unit and started to play She asked for a glove He gave her a shove Had baby McHaggis nine months to the day Three packs a day, he'll smoke till he dies Spicy McHaggis, one hell of a guy!
