From what I've heard, school seems to be a lot different from how I left it.  Hopefully it's just me, expecting it to be horrible when it won't be :|  Case is nearly packed, I'm trying to squeeze the last bits of clothes in.  I hope the people at the airport don't mess it up.  I'm still making modifications to my new layout so expect to see a few changes now and again :)
