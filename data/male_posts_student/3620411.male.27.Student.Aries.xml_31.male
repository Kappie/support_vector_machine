I think they should arrange some thing like 3 songs each. and I feel that the lighting for Sasit wasn't as good as for Richard.  The sitting now they make it as stand where the back rolls are higher above the ground. which i found it's good. better than George Benson concert where all the seats are in the same level. but the stands is wobbling and make lots of noise when people walking. and the sits are not confortable. =) appart from that it a great concert. and Sasit played way better than i thought. I saw him in last chirstmas at my university and also at the freshy nite last friday came to my uni again as member of B5 band.    More over, after I got home i found out that the water pipe was leaking and so my mom and i have to move our wardrobe out to clean the floor and i use tape to tape it but it didn't work that well. any way plan to call the plumber in the morning.   that's my joy and boring day ... -_-'
