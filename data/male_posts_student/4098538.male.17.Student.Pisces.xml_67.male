We consumed them and went for a walk around my town. Then we raced around my road on his bike. We had to turn right from my drive, past the shops, into Austell Road and then turn right back into my drive. I done it in 1.38 and he done it in 1.48. Then we saw a milk-float. Then I went to bed. Then I woke up and did some art-work. Then I wrote this. Then I clicked submit.
