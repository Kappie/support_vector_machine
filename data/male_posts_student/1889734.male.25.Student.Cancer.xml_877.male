Many times, it is difficult to understand exactly what the Left believes and why.  We get bogged down in the details without really addressing the Big Picture.  So I'd lile to ask some fundamental questions and get Danny's perspective, and then maybe we can get to some real debate about political philosophy.  So if you could take a few minutes and answer the following, I think we would appreciate it.  1).  Do you believe health care is a fundamental right?  How would you address the cost of drugs or medical care?  2).  Do you believe in hate crimes legislation, and why?  3).  Do you believe in the free market?  How much regulation is required?  4).  What is more important - that we live for ourselves or that we live for others?  5).  What is your position on the tenth amendment and what it says about 90% of all Federal regulation?  That should give us a good start to have a real discussion about philosophy, rather than sounding like a poor version of Hannity and Colmes.
