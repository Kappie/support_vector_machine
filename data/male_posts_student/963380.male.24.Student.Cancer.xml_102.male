It was a beautiful sunny day today. No one would ever imagine we were days from what could be The Next War(tm). I bought new sheets to commemorate the event. I blame the yellow sun, from which I derive my powers.  Apparently there was a Republican trying to link Peer to Peer file sharing and terrorism the other day. I'm sure the buttplug the recording industry has rammed up his ass is tipped with a radio controlled joy buzzer, but fuck's sake people, Napster and Osama?  urlLink Get the fuck real.   I went on a small Amazon spending spree last night. Fuck you Bezos, and the helicopter you rode in on. Comic book trade paperbacks should not be available for purchase at at 1 Am of any given morning. On the upside I'm now the proud owner of several high end Frank Miller and Alan Moore works. At least it's high brow comic shit.  One of my fellow associates had someone go off on him on wednesday night regarding a laptop battery. I know I promised Herr Bailey (Mein Fuhrer) that I'd never pop off at a customer again, but good leaping Christ, if someone came even close to verbalizing the canticle this bastich mananged to give sound to in my presence, their face would find umbrage from my fist. We're talking fucked, proper fucked. I think I need to seek treatment for anger management. Then again, maybe I just really need to get in another fistfight. Being half irish, I think my blood yearns for it. There's something strangely peaceful about being in the middle of a punchup.  Speaking of being Irish, stout tempers and so on, if you haven't already  urlLink voted to make St. Paddy's a national holiday , the only way you can redeem yourself is to do so. Afterwards you can print out a swell Guinness Party of Canada card. I "laminated" mine; I cut out a bit of cardboard from an audio tape case to go between the folded slices, then used packing tape to seal the card in - instant lamination with none of the cost and triple the effort.  A fucking geek am I. Sláinte!
