I've spent the last hour or so watching as many of them as possible and I must say that the Halo 2 multiplayer movies impressed me the most. Gotta love the partially destructable vehicles. I wonder if it's still XBox exclusive for two years of whatever like it was with the first one. I sure hope not. I refuse to play games with a stupid gamepad!  The new Half-Life 2 trailer didn't really tickle my fancy. Sure, it's probably gonna be awesome, but I just get the feeling we're seeing the same scenes over and over again, just from different angles. Counter-Strike on the source engine did look kinda cool though. It's weird seeing one of those old maps, but all of a sudden it doesn't look like crap anymore :)
