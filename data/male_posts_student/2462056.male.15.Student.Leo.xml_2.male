Everyone is home! Yesterday me and my family went to Atlanta to pick up my brother from the airport.  We got up around 7, which gave me a total of 4 hours of sleep, which made me feel like a pile of warm fuzzies in the morning.  We went to Waffle House on the way there though, so that made it a little better.  We got to the airport like, 2 hours early, and sat on our asses until around 1, when my brothers flight finally came in. (ooh I just found a baby lady bug on my shirt!) Then we went home, and everyone was lazy and tired, so we all just sat around and watched TV.  Mom, Dad, and Lacy watched The Cat in the Hat, but I fell asleep right at the beginning and woke up right at the end, so I don't know how it was.  That's all that happened yesterday.  Today I slept in fairly late, around 11.  I had Driver's Ed at 1.  That was interesting because I was the only one in my group who had more than 2 weeks experience behind the wheel, and also the only one to have my permit.  Tomorrow I'm going to be in the car, in traffic, with 2 people driving that have never driven in traffic before, so that is pretty scary.... hehe.  I came home, and beat Half-Life: Blueshift, because I'm a loser and I'm at the computer way to much.  Claire came home today!! That made me crazy happy, cuz I missed her like crazy.  We went to Jordan's house tonight and watched Vanilla Sky, which was a pretty good movie, but confusing.  But I got to spend time with Claire after a week of not seeing her, so it was alllll good.  After the movie we all messed around in Jordan's backyard, and me and Conor and Ben and Chrissy went on an "adventure" around the neighborhood, which was really fun.  Me and Ben made a new drink called Dr. Cokagatorspiteinade, and it is really good.  It will soon hit store shelves, and we will make millions.  So yeah... my dad set an 11:00 cerfew for me, which is gay as hell, because that is waaaay early.  So yeah......... hope that gets changed.
