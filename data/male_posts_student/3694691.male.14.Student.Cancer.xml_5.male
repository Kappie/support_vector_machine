Um...well today I recieved news that I wasn't going to get my braces off this year, but I have to wait a year...which pissed me off slightly...but thats the way life goes. At least my exams are over with an average mark of 82% which is good. Hopefully tomorrow my all in one (printer, not lycra) Canon MP370 will arrive but then again it probably won't. Ordered half-life at last...took me 3 years to do that, I'm kinda slow...I'm mainly buying it for counter strike though... So yeah I'll try to keep this blog updated once every three days or so, probably more to begin with and thats about it...so anyone who wants to read about my ever so boring life....you're in luck!
