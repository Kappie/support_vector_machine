I've heard some people complaining about it and I think they were just expecting more after hearing how it was better than the first.  Never listen to critcs, they don't know what they're talking about.  Here's a few of my gripes about it though:   *I thought Doc Ock was a great villian, but they didn't use him nearly enough in the story.   *I didn't quite get why Spider-Man had to have his mask off so much and now everyone knows who he is. *And Kirsten Dunst doesn't do it for me.  She just isn't MJ to me.   Before seeing the film I heard that there were clues as to what the next villian would be.  I thought it was going to be Venom, but if the end of the film was the "clue" I heard of then I was wrong and it wasn't much of a clue and just a slap in the face with a cold fish.   Now I'm really looking forward to  urlLink X-Men 3 , whenever that is coming out.
