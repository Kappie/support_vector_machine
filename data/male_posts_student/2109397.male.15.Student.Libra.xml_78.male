I haven't been roading in awhile and that would be fun.  I have decided not to try out for Mockingbird because I don't see a reason to anymore. Also i'd like to maintain my shutout streak against all the White players. Griffin might be mad at me but he'll get over it. That's all that happend in my ever dramatic life (jk). UM yes, United tryouts are in 4 days, and no one seems to know about them. Joey, who is an idiot in general didn't kno and is gonna miss them , and he better be playing next year because he was our best player by far well not by far but close to it.
