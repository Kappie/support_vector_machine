I started with his Neutronium Alchemist series when I was in California, and the story just blew me away.  He writes BIG books (this one is 758 pages and probably the start of another trilogy).  Usually, when you finish one of his books, you don't want to stop.  As for just completed Altered Carbon - it was a terrific book!  That guy could WRITE!  Highly recommended.  The story was optioned by Hollywood, and I think it could be a great movie in the vein of Minority Report.  There is another book centered around the main character on the way, and I'll be certain to snap it up once it arrives.
