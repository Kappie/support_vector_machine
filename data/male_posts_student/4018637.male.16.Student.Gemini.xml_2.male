I thought these friends of mine were goin out and I was in the way, but they weren't, now I feel stupid. They lead you up to something then make you jump off the deep end with out lookin down first, most girls play games, and most guys don't. I suppose it will never change. Oh well. So we went to the beach today, I was so bored everyone sat down for hours. I walked up and down the board walk at White Rock with my brother for a little over an hour and a half. When we got back I was fairly tired so I took my back-pack off and used it as a pillow I slept for a good while, when I awoke I found I had burnt my nose. It really hurts. Then we went to eat at this really cool place right on the water. I have to take the time to get my picture on here, along with all my new crew. Me and my brother are thinkin of goin to this paintball game/tournament, its 24 HOURS LONG. That's a lot of paintball, but its really fun, and it doesn't really hurt. Yup trying to figure out these people, there so confusing, Canadians I mean. Got some good pics of the water when I was at the beach.
