Our hearts tug in one direction; our heads in another. Realism and pragmatism weigh heavy upon us. Yet in fear and trembling, our hearts laid in our hands before our Lord, together, we have chosen the straight and narrow path. Till the Shepherd of our Souls leads us on other paths, or brings us in holy union before Him, we shall walk this road hand-in-hand—with no regrets.  This blog is a living memoir of our journey.   Christianity got over the difficulty of combining furious opposites, by keeping them both, and keeping them both furious.  -G.K. Chesterton
