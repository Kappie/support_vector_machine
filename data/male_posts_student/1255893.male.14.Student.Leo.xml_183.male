What happened was, the author of one of my favorite books (Love Rules) Marilyn Reynolds came to Cleveland. our class dropped by, asked her questions, listened to passages from the book, things like that. Afterward, there were copies of her books being sold for cheap, so I bought a copy of Love Rules. The awesome thing was...... she actually signed it for me! Wo0t! =D Then when I got out of the school, I was surprised by Daddy who actually came to pick me up for once. Then once I got home I was left to cook the chicken .... and I wuv chicken so.... \m/. So besides the fact that I have an insane amount of homework... today's been totally awesome. I guess I should go do it now. Im out.
