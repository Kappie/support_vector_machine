Full-time report:- CROATIA 0-0 SWITZERLAND ::Not much highlights can be given. ::Swiss did better in the second half but also,as the Croats had done,didn't take their chances.  Conclusion:This result is not favourable for both Croatia and Switzerland since they are both the underdogs in Group B which contains the two other big teams,England  France.They both get only 1 point each and a win might help 1 of them to have better chances of qualifying from the group.Fromt this,I can infer that France and England look set to qualify from the group unless their match later also ends up a tie.But even if it ends up as a tie,they still have the upper hand as they have much better squads than Croatia and Switzerland and both England  France will face both Croatia  Switzerland after this match.  _::signin' off:UrCh!n::_ EXCLUSIVE EURO 2004 COVERAGE BY URCH!N:)
