Unlike yesterday, however, I got properly dressed (gasp!) and went to the orthodontist. Yes, those evil folks that have plagued my mouth with burden after burden of tooth-correcting contraptions. Good news though! They say I get my braces n' such off in six weeks! Whoo! I can't wait to chew gum and eat sticky candy again (this isn't to say I haven't, because try as they might, they cannot stop me from chewing my beloved bubblegum! when no one's looking.   On a completely different note, Chi's too bootylicious for me. He'd better get his damned internet back soon.
