I have to make up my maths (Algebra 1B) and French 1  outside of I-Poly. I'll try Mt. Sac Semester 2.  Welcome to the life of indepedence.  But anyways... after my interview, I went to Munjal's to do some wifi thingies. We got a network up but only received the WEP'd network. In which we didn't hack. And he got me thinking.  Why do I like girls so much (in the pants) but afraid to talk to them?
