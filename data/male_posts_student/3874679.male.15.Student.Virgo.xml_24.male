I used to watch show every mornin when I was in elementary and middle school. Then I got up and washed my fdace and brushed my teeth and got on here, talked with friends for a lil while, then got dressed and went to breakfast. Of course I went to Hardees. Then I had to go to the bowling alley to ride with James and jessica to pick out the trophies for bowling. I actually got to make the choices. I felt special. Anyway, after we got done there we went back to the center and mom picked me up. Mom went to Wal Mart while I was with Jessica and James, while she was there she bought me the new Joe Nichols "Revelation" CD. I would highly recommend it to anyone. All of the songs are awesome. Then of course she had to go to Dollar Tree, she loves that store way too much. Then as my luck would have it, we got stuck in there because it started pouring down rain. I wasnt very happy to say the least. Then we came home and I ate a cheeseburger for lunch. Then I got back on here and am doin pretty good. Ohh yeah one more thing, it rained so I didnt have to go to work. HALLELUJAH. ROFL. Yall have a great afternoon. Love, Carson
