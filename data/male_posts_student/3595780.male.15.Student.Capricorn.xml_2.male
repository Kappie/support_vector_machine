A time where you get better aquianted with your sibblings, if you live in the same house, yet a time when you draw further away from them because you notice how strange they are. It's also a time for relaxing and sipping that ice cold glass of lemonade tht so fondly characterizes the essence of summer. It's also a time when those of that have a job don't want it and those of us who don't have a job do because of money scarcity.  Well, summer has it's ups and downs, but on the whole we are temporarily released from the stench pit of our menial school attendance. Yes, no school is what summer is all about. And as summer begins I want you to take a lok back on the year you made it through and quickly forget it as your brain turns to mush and you dont have a thing to worry about, unless of course you have to take summer school. To you sad individuals I extend my greatest sympathy. Don't die on us.  urlLink My Homepage
