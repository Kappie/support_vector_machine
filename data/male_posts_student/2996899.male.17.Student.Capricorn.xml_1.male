A bunch of people went down to Valdosta H.S. today for the region literary meet where we came in second to Tift County.  I competed in the Spelling competition and placed in 4th because the man reading the words was not capable of pronouncing most of them, "turret" being an example.  It wasn't really his fault though because he was a math teacher after all.  Anyways, there is going to be a lot more bitching and moaning if the Gators don't beat the "Pay"Roll Tide tonight in the SEC Tournament.  Oh yeah, Duke blows.
