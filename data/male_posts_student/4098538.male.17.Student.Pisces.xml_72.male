It was pretty blank because I couldn't think of good qualities about me! Then we went to town and gave them out everywhere. I'm really determined to get a job now, I really need some pences in my bank account. I've managed to save Â£80 up to now for an upcoming festival but a job really would help out. I tried Music Zone, H, Littlewoods, Schuh and some other places but I can't really remember them. I am just waiting for some replies now =) and they better start coming! I'm just thinking of something to write to waste 20 minutes, 'cause that's when Mandy finishes work and I can call her. I've missed her a lot today because we had a really nice, argument-free day and I didn't want it to end. But she's coming over tomorrow night so it's gonna be good. 72 hours of Mandyness =D aww yeahhhh mattteeeeeee! Well, I am thinking it's babble time! I am really into the following bands right now - The Agony Scene, Sworn Enemy (they're a bit like a not-as-hardcore Hatebreed in my opinion), As I Lay Dying, Cannae, Bleeding Through... and some other bands that fail to come to mind. Why didn't I discover this genre sooner? It's got everything I like in music - fast, powerful riffs with plenty of pinch harmonics and palm muting, speedy drums and screaming vocals that put plenty of others to shame. That's exactly what The Agony Scene, Cannae and As I Lay Dying sound like. Sworn Enemy aren't as fast, and there riffs are a lot more simple, but it still sounds damn good. Bleeding Through are pretty similar to Cannae but they are a lot darker. What's the time? 10.48. Dammit! All of that only took me 8 minutes. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Huhuhuhuhuh! I wanna job. Well no, I want money. I might mug Bill Gates and steal his wallet, huhuhuhuhuh. I got a goofy laugh apparently. NICE! Oh fuck this, I really cannot be bothered!
