It was a small wedding party, filled with great people, most of whom I knew and cared for. Linda, as I stated yesterday brought her boyfriend and along the ride they brought me... So I was the third wheel... That's when everything went uphill. For a time now I've been thinking to get along with Linda's bf 'cause I care for her and he's been in the picture longer than me, so at the end he has the upper hand. So yesterday I tried to be nicer and more talkative. Turns out he's a lot like me. What I did not know was that he knew I was gay. It all came up this way:  I've been planning a trip to Lake Tahoe for the summer vacations, in the picture is Linda, Marcos ( Linda's bf ), Alejandra and me. Well, in the car and at the party he asked me to explain to him what was the deal with the vacation, how long we would stay? How we'll gonna get there? Etcetera. At the party he brought back the issue and asked who would be my companion. I said Rebecca or Alejandra, he replied -"what about a male friend"- ...Oh ok! I think I turned red and as with this subject my heart started pumping blood to my head... You know, I felt a little lighter than usual; plus he had a grin in his face. It seemed it took a little courage for him to ask that 'cause he was a little blushed himself. Anyway, I explained I did not want to do it, bring a friend, a male friend I mean. So we started talking and he asked some questions and asked for some gay slang... It was very funny. I had a great time all in all. And as he knew Adrian, he asked about us. Not a good thing to remember on the dawn of valentine's day, so I had to cut to the short version of it:  "It jus did not work, but we are friends"  ( cut to the scene in where Alejandra, Linda and Rebeca rolled their eyes and started moving their heads in disagreement... Hey I'm human, I need friends! ).  The way back was a moment to remember too. We all had a little too much Tequila and Buchanan's in our blood; so Marcos started asking more questions. -What about the gaydar? When did you know you were gay? What about your first bf? What's the deal with S? Why all you "people" are so smart and fashionable? How do you do to understand women so good? Do you hit on straight guys?- An awkward but a funny night. He even tried to fix me up with one of his friends... LOL! ... I had to pass on that chance. In all this, Linda was so funny and supportive.  Now the wedding. I won't talk about it 'cause that's personal. The party I can comment on it. It was funny, it was simple, it was friendly. This was the first time I have met the guy and just let me tell you: O...Kay! Anyway, I just wish Alejandra happiness or half of his state. Whatever comes first.
