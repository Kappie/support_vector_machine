Yeah, things have been going good for the most part, I'm going to miss my buddies while I'm up there but a few of them will join me. I look forward to wakeboarding and jamming on the guitar and bass stuff. It's gonna be good. I'll make a post about Farenheit 9/11 first chance I get. That is a movie you should go see. If biased and one sided it is still an incredibly powerful movie. -Tired Gavin I've been dying to meet you, there must be a devil between us
