I haven't had just a relaxing time hanging out with anyone since that Saturday night at JWT sitting around playing cards and having a drink... and before that... sheesh, who knows?  Yeah, it was great, but I still need to find some single friends where I don't have to look at, think about, or talk about significant others for a bit.  I'm very glad that people are happy, I just want that for myself, too.  When you don't have that, but you want it, your heart aches... and sometimes you just need to take your mind off of it.
