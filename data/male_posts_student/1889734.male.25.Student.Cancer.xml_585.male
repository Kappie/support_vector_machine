Part of me groans in potential pain, while another part is giddy with possibilities.  But why is he writing them?  Is it a crass exercise in harvesting money, or does he have something to say?  From the web site -   But if you've known the story for so many years, why did you wait until now to begin writing it?                That's complicated. One perfectly valid reason is that I wanted to prove to my readers--and to myself--that I could write other types of stories, and write them well. Another is that a significant number of other stories (in fact, twelve books' worth) came to me to be written. But perhaps the deepest, most personal reason is that I was afraid. At my first glimpse of "The Last Chronicles," I knew that it would be astonishingly difficult to write; that as a narrative exercise it would make the previous "Covenant" stories look like a stroll in the park. If this last story is done right, if it fulfills my intentions, it will complete and unify the entire saga. But in order to accomplish that goal I'll have to go far beyond my known abilities, both as a story-teller and as a writer. The prospect terrified me. It still does. The argument could be made that everything I've written since I first conceived "The Last Chronicles" has been an attempt to expand my abilities and resources; to make myself ready for the story I'm writing now.    We'll see.  Here's hoping that they live up to the first trilogy (and for you naysayers, I still maintain that the second trilogy was worth every moment.)
