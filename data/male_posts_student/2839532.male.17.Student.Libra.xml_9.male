Well actually, one was happy wok, but they weren't there for some reason, so I'm going to head over there momentarily to try again.  The other, however, was there and seemed interested.  I might start selling pens through this old black man who owns Mail  More at the new Kroger on mansell road.  He seemed like a real nice guy, and was probably in his late 50's to early 60's.  I showed him some of my pens and told him how much it would cost, and he said he'd think about it.  Hopefully he'll call.. As far as Happy Wok, well, I hope to make an online ordering system for them.  I won't bother with the specifics here though...  Danie's in New York visiting family and will be till the 22nd i think... and I'm leaving for Rhode Island the 23rd.  I miss her a lot.  Anyways, I hope that Morgan actually comes through this time and does the site.. I don't have time for it right now.  I guess if he doesn't hold up his bargain, I may just have to do it myself.. ah well.  Anyways, look for updates on that.  Ta ta for now.
