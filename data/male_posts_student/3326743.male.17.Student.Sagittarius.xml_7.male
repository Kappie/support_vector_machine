The story of the disciples fishing and Christ telling them to cast their net on the other side of the boat.  Pastor spoke about many things.  The title of the sermon was "Renewing the Fisherman's Calling."  It was a good sermon for the start of the summer to make sure that we renew ourselves to doing what God would have us to do.  To make sure that we are witnesses and that we don't fall into our old routine that we had b/4 he called us.  Anyway, just some random thoughts.
