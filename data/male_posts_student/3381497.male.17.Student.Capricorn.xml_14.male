I saw Best Interest, New Found Glory, The Sounds, Saosin, Co  Ca, The Early November, Thursday, Story of the Year, Atmosphere, The Bled, Underoath, and Taking Back Sunday. The line-up could've been alot better, but I really have nothing to complain about since I did get to see Saosin and The Bled, which were the main reasons I came there. Some dude broke his fucken leg like a minute after Saosin started, which was fucken gay since it took the crew about 15 minutes to get him off the stage, everyone was pissed and some even left. I went hardcore dancing which was alot of fun, except I got socked in the face during The Bled and now my right eye is all swollen. It really wouldn't be a problem except I have senior pictures in a few days; I really hope it heals by then. The funny thing is I didn't even notice that my eye was hurting til I want to eat a couple hours later. I also have a bruised hip and thumb, but they're not that big of a deal. Another bad thing was during Saosin I was so dehydrated I couldn't sing along as hard as I could, I almost collapsed after they finished, luckily there was a frozen lemonade stand. Another thing was since I didn't have much to eat cause of lack of money I had this huge headache and after The Bled I almost collaped again, so my friend bought some water. But I really couldn't do anything for Underoath and TBS, so I just stood in the back somewhere and sang along. After that we went to Taco Bell and had some food; now that I could afford. After all that I still have no regrets from what happened, except I really wanted a Bled or Underoath shirt, which I couldn't afford. I really need a job. Oh and I think a highlight of the night was when Adam of TBS hung on the 20 ft. high ceiling during CUTE without the 'E' upside down, that was some crazy shit.  Oh and I saw this girl over there that looked so much like my "friend". That was sort of depressing to see. She didn't want to go anyways cause she didn't like the line-up that much either. God I miss her, I havent talked to her since "that night", and she hasn't been online lately. She's probably the last thing I think of right before I go to sleep every night. Atleast it seems I'm getting used to be "diabetic"(see a couple posts down if you don't know what's up).   On a completely different subject, I still haven't gotten my summer school classes yet which sucks. Now I have to go to school to pick it up. I really hope my councilor didn't fuck up and forgot to schedule my classes, cause I really need those classes or it'll fuck up my whole fall schedule.   urlLink    You bitches buy this shit, it's gonna be great.
