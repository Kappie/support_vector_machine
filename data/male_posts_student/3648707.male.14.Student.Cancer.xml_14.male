Linkin Park- Crawling  [chorus:] Crawling in my skin These wounds they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real  There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface Consuming, confusing This lack of self-control I fear is never ending controlling, I can't seem  [bridge:] To find myself again My walls are closing in (without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take) I've felt this way before So insecure  [chorus]  Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me Distracting, reacting Against my will I stand beside my own reflection It's haunting how I can't seem...  [bridge]  [chorus x2]   and another song,  Linkin Park- In The End (It starts with one)  One thing, I don’t know why It doesn’t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To explain in due time  (All I know)  Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away  (It’s so unreal)  Didn’t look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on, but didn’t even know I wasted it all just to watch you go  (Watch you go)  I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of the time when I tried so hard  [chrous]:  I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter  One thing, I don’t know why It doesn’t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme To remind myself how I tried so hard  (I tried so hard)  In spite of the way you were mocking me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me I’m surprised it got so   (far)  Things aren’t the way they were before You wouldn’t even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me  (In the end)  You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of the time when...  [chrous]  I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this There’s only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go And for all this There’s only one thing you should know  [chrous]   thats it for now, talk to you later.
