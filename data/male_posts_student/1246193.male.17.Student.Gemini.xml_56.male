There are songs that just instantly put me into a good mood.  For the three minutes that one of those songs is on, there is nothing else in the world.  It is a feeling which is almost impossible to describe.  There are simply no words that do the feeling justice. I think the reason that I like "oldies" so much is that so many of those songs put me into a great mood.  Classical music calms me down.  Modern music makes me feel jumpy and uncomfortable.  However, "oldies" are the only songs that can actually change my outlook on the entire day for the better.  I am beginning to understand why other people enjoy their music so much.  It is because it gives them a feeling that they enjoy and nothing else can give a person the same feeling.  I am going to try to be more tolerent of different styles of music and listen to it more closely.  Who knows, maybe I will be able to find another song that puts me into a good mood.
