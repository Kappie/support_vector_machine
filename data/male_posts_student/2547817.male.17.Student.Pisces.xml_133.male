What's more, he was kind enough to accommodate my waking up late. I took the amp home after service and hopped on a train to Sharm's place. I was late coz of church, but they didn't mind.   We ate! Sausages, Salad with cheese (not tofu Leon), Chips with salsa and Sharm's own dip,Mini tomatoes,AND PIZZA! There's not anything better than Pizza and Hazel. Oh and we had ICE CREAM CAKE from SWENSENS! Dried ice and all! And did you know that Ice cream cake is made from actual ice cream? I'm sorry, but I'm terribly deprived of some things. And yes it's embarrassinglytrue, I'd have never known!   We played! On the swings where I tore the back of my ACJC branded shirt (good on you Mr Swing!). With a deflated basket ball. Touch rugby, monkey, soccer. Let's just say that we're all not the "sporty type". I'm not shy with the UWCers. I can be myself and they like me regardless. Khin, Leon, Shyam, Sharm, Fauzi and I.  I watched them today and was happy that they were happy together. It was A picture out of a movie. A couple comes running up a hill, the girl laughing, followed by the boy and they sit on swings and have a good time. Love is magical and infectious (sorry for the lack of a better word).   Jolyn came, and I fell silent for a good art of about half an hour. I contemplated leaving. I'm nervous around her now. I shouldn't be! Oh! by the way, I've gotten three people tell me that they thought I liked Jo. I do not. Now that that's straight, the second thing I wanna talk about is my use of the word like. It's innocent. Please don't make more out of it than there actually is. Otherwise, you'd be an ACSian. I do not have a crush onJolyn. The prospect was rather ticklish though. All of us dunked each other in the pool. Leon was a fighter, but in the end, I won.We behaved like children. It was good. I'm sad that things between her and I are not working out.   After this, I went jamming. There's nothing better than Pizza. YES! I HAD PIZZA AGAIN. Aren'tI lucky? We played and had fun too. I'm very tired now. Have to sleep. Basically, Jireh, ended a great day by agreeing to stay with the band. It was good. I am pleased.   The second and only regret I have today is that I don't have the energy to complete this blog well. Just know that I am very happy today. Good night.
