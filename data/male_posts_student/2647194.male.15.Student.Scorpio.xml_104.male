The weather sucked up in Brainerd-cold and rainy. Not good weather for biking...  What I did and didn't do on a 2-day vacation:  Did- -sleep in -ate at China Buffet -ate at Prairie Bay Heartland Restaurant (they have a $157 bottle of wine there...) -biked 15 miles -saw Fahrenheit 9/11 (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!) -went bowling at Paul Bunyan Bowl -played pool at Paul Bunyan bowl  Did not- -go biking enough -see the movies I wanted  So its nearly determined that I'll quit biking and either: 1. start up baseball again 2. play tennis (yay!)  Also another thing I plan to do some day soon is go movie hopping the whole day at Oakdale cinemas. Pay for 1 movie, see 4. Good deal if you ask me.
