It was a great moment. Solitude. Cold. Then the natural and logical call of disgust from my companions, yelling they were cold. A call back to reality.  Those have been my days. Not much to be happy for, at least, my life fits my blog title. How fun for me! ( sigh ). I guess I'm just bored. Tired of the town. I need my friends and take a vacation. The trip to NY fell, so did the one to Mexico City. I've spent to much on me lately, too much on thing not at all necessaries.  Am I that whinny? I think I am. It scares me!  Well, all in all I saw LOR, the return of the king. What a magnificentent piece of cinema. Maybe it wasn't necessary the last minutes of the movie, most that've read the book new about the fate of the fellowship, and the ones that didn't could have easily managed to guess the rest of it since the moment Frodo woke up and saw all  together on Minas Tirith. Still, is nice to see a book that one loves so much into something that sticks a lot to its essence, and gives a great representation on the cinematic format. I thought the last sentence on the book was as great as Tolkien could go, with a sense of coldness that pictured the natural sense of life: we have to move on. The movie makes those words look even deeper: we have to move on, but still caring. That "I'm back" is just great. Now I think that in the last three years a lot of the people I know, included myself, expected december just to see a part of the LOR trilogy, now what? As once I read, at least is great to live in this time, were great books are represented as no one can imagine, as good as they can get, is just an explosion that covers all senses but smell.  Anyway, at the end of the movie I rushed home to change and get ready to school. I was so annoyed of those kids on the theater, man they were a bunch of brats. To my surprise I found a professorless school, with lots of vexed students. Why didn't they tell us that we weren't having classes? What's the point on spending almost an hour on the road, fighting traffic just to get in time to a closed school?  As I was going back home, I spent a lot of time thnking in the car. Too much thinking. All my fears came to mind. All my anxieties. All my love problems. All my heart problems. All my not-moving-on issues. I'm a drama queen, there's no need to ask. Still, I hope this christmas days won't be tainted by... This is my most favorite season, the one I expect with so much love and it would much hurt me to be ruined this year, since I so do need the cheering up of the season.  In other issues, well not others, just maybe in other degree. Mom is great with me, but at the sheer sign of the word gay by any of my brothers or in the tv, she just shut herself if Im around. I know she has issues or just needs time to cope with all of it, but it hurts. I'm afraid to be totally alone at any moment of the day with her, 'cause I don't wish to be interrogated.
