So, while I'm taking a break from that (because so much playing can kill your arms), I've decided to blog for a while...kinda like what I've been doing all day over at bagel.tech.  So, let me think about stuff to blog about...  ...all I can think about is how hot it is outside.  I live on the freakin' river, but, there's gators in there, and swimming is NOT my thing.  My fan's doing a pretty good job of keeping me somewhat cool, but, NOT GOOD ENOUGH!    Maybe I should go read someone else's blog and say stuff about it.  But no, that's reserved for Late Night Bloggin'.  Or, maybe, I could do "Absolute Hotism," but, that just sounds retarded.  Its too hot for human creation to live on this planet.  I wonder what Mars is like.  Hell, it's probably hotter there.    I would hate to live in a place like Texas, where it gets over 100 degrees in a day.  I feel bad for people who are stuck living there...especially if they don't have air conditioners...  Well, with that being said, I'm going back to play Spiderman 2.  Hopefully by the time my next post tonight comes along, I'll actually have something to talk about.  Until then, go cool down.  It's hot outside.
