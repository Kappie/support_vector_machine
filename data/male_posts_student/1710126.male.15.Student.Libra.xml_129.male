After listening to the talk i decided i'll be miserable as a lawyer....then journalism n advertiseing lectures convinced me tt the creative field is where i wanna be...i m oredy doing some of those stuffs in sch and i love it! haha...did alota serious thinking...i knoe Santok (issat how u spell it?) Singh made it sound glamorous...but i was thinking really hard and yeah...its interesting...communications possibly oso tho there was no tok on it...advertising! wow! haha. Further more can dress whatever u want lol.....nahz tts not the thing...        And advertsing makes more than 5000!!!! oh wow...tts impressive...but its fufilling...law is so unfufilling...the ppl were like saying "I am here bcoz i m interested in law" and i realise i cant say tt! i knoe nuts abt law....        Journalism... communications... advertising... oh wellz...haha...and keep my options open... hmz what else?
