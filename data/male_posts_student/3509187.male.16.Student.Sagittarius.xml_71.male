All the problems were a result of mankinds own actions.  There couldn't be a hero that defeated the evil in one quick attack, there was no one representing at that is bad in this world, it was a picture of what we will do to ourselves.  Not having a bad guy gave the movie a different depth, people could defend themselves from the weather, but they could never fight back against it.  If you haven't see the movie yet you should, at least plan on seeing it when its out on video/DVD, its pretty good.  -Dan V
