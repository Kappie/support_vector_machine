It grows In spring storms.  It shines Like the moon.  The fruit is harvested And all is well.  It withers And turns gray.  But a seed was sown It begins to grow  Just like a peach tree on a hill.   "Over This" A flash of light A clap of black thunder The clack of tracks The clash of lightning And always the sound of rain  But over this The swan's song Is heard clear And this is my poem for English tomorow, we had to write it like the first stanza of "I wandered lonely as a cloud."  "Away We Drank the Day" I wandered sad as an abandoned old house, To be a host for not even a ghost, When all at once I saw a mouse, Who made a boast that we should have a toast, In a most mischievious way, So away we drank the day. In study hall I also came up with a new short  Poetry is finding the word that's worth a thousand pictures.  Electronics was really REALLY boring today.  yet at the same time entertaining... lol.  He (the teacher) defines Electronics as "Electricity with Intelligence"  'Something I lack' I thought he should have said after that.  Anyway I haveta do my eash homework.  Later  fyi - I have 21 poems now, made up of exactly 1800 words and spanning 374 lines. (there are others, but i know not where they are, plus they're old, and therefore, mostly crap)
