I'd also like to direct your attention to  this , a rather long but well-worth-the-read opinion piece that expresses perfectly many of my own thoughts, feelings, and reactions to the  Marriage Amendment Bill  itself. I've been far too angry to write anything convincing or articulate of my own since it happened, so it was especially good to come across. I only wish there was an email address for the author because I would love to get in touch.
