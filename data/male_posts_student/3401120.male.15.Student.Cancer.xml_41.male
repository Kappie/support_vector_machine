That'd be a lot of time and im not sure if i'll ever see him again. Its so sad, why do the people i love the most have to go away? its like this time i lost someone who was a very important part of my life, he was the best person i ever met. but well since all the "badass hoes" is now fucked up becuz of my fight with dana and jordan's leaving, i had to permanently delete the badass hoes website. it seemed like a very cool and nice project, but becuz of these "events" i had no choice. so i decided to start a new website, this time its a hacking website and its in spanish, at least i wont have to worry about updating other websites becuz i now only have two. but still i felt so sad when i deleted that site. oh well i'll try to get over it and i hope i see him again. i dont care about dana but jordan is really important... oh well i'll just keep going and thats all, but i'll miss that dude. so if you know some spanish, check out my site  urlLink http://www.sliphack.tk  it rules. See ya all later, i gotta study for the extra exam of math that will be on monday of the next week. I need to pass it so i'll really be a 9th grader, so goodbye people.
