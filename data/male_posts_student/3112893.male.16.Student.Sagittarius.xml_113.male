My theory is for me to really combat this problem I'd need to make a life-style change and we all know how I hate those. Now, as I've said before, I'm no chemist or biologist, but I think that my diet of ho-ho's, sugar'd popcorn, ramen, and shrek candies are my worst enemies at the moment. There are also reports of high Dorito and Lay's Stax consumption that may also be contributing to the problem. Well, instead of a real change in my lifestyle that would fix the problem, I think I'll just do the american thing and just settle with declaring war on it.    We, the people of Unpasteurized, declare an all out war on Acne!! We won't stop until every pimple is destroyed!   ... but we won't  actually  do anything about it.  That is all.         -- Feanor
