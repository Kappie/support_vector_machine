It's hard to believe  all of the war films that you see, yet with all the difficulty posed to our imaginations by Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, I don't doubt the veracity of the horror of war.   My father keeps saying that "what this generation needs is a war." Sadly, these men were shaped by a need to survive, not a feeling of omnipotence garnered through technology. To paraphrase, "War *was* hell*, now it comes down to bugs in the software and miss dropped air strikes.  To the men and women who fought so bravely to defend us against a terror much much worse than anything seen in the last forty years, thank you. You did so with little more than your own ingenuity and zero technological advantages.  I'm not sure which President said it - FDR or Truman, but "We owe so much, to so few...."
