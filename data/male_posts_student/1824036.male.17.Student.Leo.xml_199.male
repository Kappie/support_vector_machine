Actually...its really stupid.  urlLink Blogger  and  urlLink Mozilla  dont seem to like each other on my computer. That is why I haven't posted in a while. The other reason is a little more practical.    Jadie went to Orlando on a youth gathering trip of sorts for her church. I miss her so much. I cant wait for her to get back. She said she will get back wednesday night out of the Des Moines airport...but knowing her mom I probably wont get to see her. Just because they have been gone and they need their "family time" or summin....    Oh well. I cant wait until Jadie gets back. I miss her so much.
