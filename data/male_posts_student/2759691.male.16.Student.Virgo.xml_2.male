"We're paying our president more than $400,000 here," said a government economic, "but there [in India] we can get the job done for around $8." The announcement comes a week after the government announced it will outsource "unskilled" jobs to developing nations. "It's all about helping the poor countries," said Vice-President Cheney. Additional information on the outsourcing will be released after the November elections.
