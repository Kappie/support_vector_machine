This last week has literally whizzed past, making that exact noise as it did so. As I'm sure all of you know, this last week is traditionaly a week in which the calendars are full up with variouse social gatherings of one kind or another. I have in fact been to two parties this week, and almost made it to 4, (sorry Ged and Sam...) so my time has been incredibly full up leaving no room for, say, tidying my room, or even preparing my presentation for modern studies due in on Wednesday. Not cool. Party numero uno was a small local get together, consisting of a few friends and myself meeting up at Danny's house (kudos to him), where we all had a great time just chilling out. A Halo tournament was played, loud music was on constantly (no, no, no more Metalica, for the love of anthropomorphic personification of human permenance). Later on we proceeded to one of the many sitting rooms that infest my friends house like some kind of parasitic extension. We then lit a nice log fire, and whittled away the hours, drinking fine wine and port and just generally talking. Okay, it sounds crap, but it was actually realy groovy, despite a few things being mentioned that really shouldn't have been.  And if that doesn't leave you intrigued, all I'll say is eeuuuuggghhhh... We then whent to bed at the healthy time of 5 in the morning. And I got the bed this time, so thanks to Tim Collins for being born, for with out him his parents would never have bought the bed that I slept in, and my night would have been much less restfull! Party numero two was a slightly larger affair. This was a goodbye party to two of my Quaker buddies Hannah Reade and Sam Turner. Both are leaving the country soon, so about 40 of us gathered on the meadows in Edinburgh to wish them farewell. Despite the sweltering heat, a good time was had by all, as we ate, drank and chatted into the evening. What's also cool is that while this was happening we were being filmed as part of a program by BBC Scotland about young people and their faith. Faith isn't something I'm going to go into here, as if I did I'd be here all night, so a post for another day methinks. So, if by any chance you happen to be flicking through the TV channels in the future, and a random group of scary hippies appear, it's probably us. Anyhoo As the sun finally set, those few of us who were staying the night in Edinburgh made their way to their variouse ports of call. Myself and 13 weary companions made our way, by route of variouse pub toilets, to Hannahs house, were the partying continued. To cut a long story short, I had a great time bar one embarrasing incident involving myself and the living room floor. Actually, I feel really shit  and guilty about the whole episode, as it was a really crappy thing to do at someones leaving party. So Hannah, if by any chance you read this, I'm  really  sorry. I know I've said this already, but I still feel bad about the whole thing. Oh, and many thanks for looking after me, it was much appreciated. So, overall a mostly groovy week, and it would seem that party time is over and schools back in. Or is it? I've been thinking a lot the past week (stop press!), and I may have a cunning plan... Thanks for reading Stay Beautiful Davus
