The days have been for the most part good and fun, but I dunno... my body isn't doing too well. I wonder if its because I've been working out and my body is adjusting to the activity level. Not really sure...  The song playing right now is  R.E.M. 's "Losing My Religion" from their  Out Of Time  album (2001).  **
