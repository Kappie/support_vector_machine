Observe them through a series of interactive, feeding and training sessions specially designed to demonstrate their natural abilities of tail-walking synchronisation.   Lucky visitors might even score a peck on the cheek, or a chance to wade next to them, fully supervised by the trainers, of course.  "Meet the Dolphin" sessions take place at 11am*, 1.30pm, 3.30pm  5.30pm daily.  taken from:  (http://www.sentosa.com.sg/explore_sentosa/explore_dolphin.htm)
