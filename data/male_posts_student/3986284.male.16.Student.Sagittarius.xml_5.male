Which is cool. I'm gonna see her tuesday at Scandia, tis going to be fun. Then I think we are going to see Harold and Kumar go to White Castle wednesday. I haven't seen a pic of her yet really lol. BUT I have talked to her on the phone (2 hours collect), and she has a very beautiful voice. GOD DAMN YOU MONTANA!!!!! um !!! But yeah, sh's seen my blondie pics from Jojo's site and says I have a cute laugh lol. Damn, I am too damn happy right now so soon after I told the girl I loved that I no longer want to speak to her. But I don't care, Hannah makes me happy and to me right now, in the present, that's all that matters. Lol, one more thing before I go, I like tic tacs, lol. BYEE oh yeah and Vic, I AM GOING TO KICK UR ASS ABOUT SHEENA! lol just a little FYI
