First Aaron was like, nah im not up for it tonight, Then evan was like like nah im totally not allowed, then luke was like I'd love to, that is untill i got to his place then he was all dude im not allowed either. So i put on my favourite song, show me your soul, and started the long drive to carolines. It would have been simple excpet i missed a road three times, and then another one three times! all in all i did about 8 3 point turns. I was so much fun. infact it was Pain inducing fun! Caroline was all like i need a nurofen all this smiling's starting to hurt.
