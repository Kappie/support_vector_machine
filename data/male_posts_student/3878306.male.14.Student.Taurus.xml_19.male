I woke up at 9 or so and well I was at my cousins house and they woke up because there was thunder but I didn't remember so it doesn't matter what did matter was that it was raining and it is going to rain the entire week. (Bad luck just likes me). Anyway I tried that spongebob game with the nose as the controler. And then found Final Fantasy 7 and noticed that those graphics are so bad after looking at the recent Final Fantasies. (Man they don't even play it they should give it to me... I feel bad for the game... it wants to be played) well it was fine anyway...
