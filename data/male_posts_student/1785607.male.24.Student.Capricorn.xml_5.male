It has nothing to do to try to avoid drama, it has nothing to do with me trying to live stress free. It has everything to do with the fact that I'm still in love... and now that I see this, I know, though that I made the right decision, I can't move on... This feeling is strong and is still in me... We are not friends anymore, we became distant, even though a relation is there.   Now I think in my later relations, and it comes to mind, did I sabotage those? I know I did what I had to do, they wanted a strong and lasting relationship, but I just wasn't ready, in fact, I didn't care for one of those... Love those persons to death, and they are still my friends... but they were just not what I wanted or needed.   So, is this normal? it's been a long time since we broke... Maybe is that I didn't let myself down, and I did need those days to break my heart out... last night I did it and it felt great... though now I feel so blue, that I just want to hang in my room listening to everything Sarah McLachlan can offer me. Just so you know, and I think you'll read this one day:   I still Love you, and I know you have moved on, still, just wanted you to know that I'll be alright.     It was such a nice and lovable relation. We needed each other, we complemented each other... now is just me! And that makes my heart ache. It is impossible to be together again? Yes, is not as if we wanted to be together again we could, no, is the fact that we don't belong together.  Man I'm feelin' blue!    I just feel in the same place, I feel static, everything's the same. I need new an exciting elements in my life, something that can make me forget about everything that makes me sad...       Autumn is here inside my heart  When there's springtime in the air  Loneliness is tearing me apart  Being lost makes me scared   I keep on asking the gods above  To send my love back to me  Oh please let these days and weeks  Pass by so quickly   Nobody suffers like I do  Nobody else, oh no  Nobody suffers like I do  Nobody else but you   You had to leave, I know  And we knew it would be tough  You said you would be back soon  Soon is not soon enough   I keep on asking the gods above  To send my love back to me  Oh please let these days and weeks  Pass by so quickly   Nobody suffers like I do  Nobody else, oh no  Nobody suffers like I do  Nobody else but you   Through this waiting in vain  All this darkness and pain  I've been crying for you, now I'm dying  When this test is at end  I hope you'll understand  That you're all that I've got  Oh darling   Nobody suffers   Autumn is here inside my heart  When there's springtime in the air   Nobody suffers like I do  Nobody else, oh no  Nobody suffers like I do  Nobody else but you     Suffering.
