Seems like a very good start to the bidding, hopefully go up a bit; which means that after we pay off my dad and his son of a bitch attorney, we should be able to afford to stay in the area!  Other than that, nothing too eventful lately. Just spending all my time working on the house, today its prepping, painting, and moving furniture, tomorrow its moving stuff and waxing the floors.  Not too much free time, which is ok, because it seems that everyone I know is now working and too busy to hangout much.  Getting a lit fed up with the dating pool up here.  Seems like most people I've met seem fine until you scratch the surface, and they turn out to be damaged goods.  Is it so much to ask for a little less baggage/drama?  Back to work...   urlLink Why Michael Moore is just as bad as his targets    urlLink Israel's Intifada Victory    "We will win because we must live. Our neighbours are fighting not for their lives, nor for their sovereignty, they are fighting to destroy us. We will not be destroyed. We dare not be destroyed. Therefore, the spirit of our men on the front, the spirit of our people in every home, in every city, in every village, is a spirit of a people that hates war but knows that in order to live it must win the war that has been forced upon it."   -Golda Meir, October 13, 1973 (on Israel's fight to survive against tyranny) (Thanks Justin)
