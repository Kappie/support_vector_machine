He said bla bla bla [can't recall, sleepin most of the time] Honestly speaking, i dont know waddafuck this got to do with social studies. Bleah. The speaker said somethin bout guys being biologically useless, coz with the so-called latest technology, the egg doesnt actually need the sperm to reproduce. I was like... waddafuck?  But after thinkin bout it for 2min 94 seconds, i came to a conclusion that guys = useless. Soon, we'll see all the people in the parliament being replaced by girls one by one, then they'll rule the world while we guys become their slaves. Bleah. Well, this is my opinion by the way, so all those  "tough guys"  who find this difficult to swallow, go fuck yourself. This is MY blog anyway.      Reasons why girls are better than guys:   -Can accuse someone of rape and people will  actually  believe you   -Can get free drinks on ladies night   -Can have multiple orgasms   -Can keep either short or long hair and still look good   -Can where pink without getting called a faggot   -Need not worry bout gettin caned when charged for something illegal   -Need not aim when it comes to pissing   -Need not be ashamed to be a housewife, but househusband? Eeee...   -Need not pay just to have sex, can just seduce them or sit in a bar till someone picks you up. (may not be applicable to VERY ugly girls)   -Need not worry bout size (boobjobs are easily available. currently, dickjobs dont exist yet)
