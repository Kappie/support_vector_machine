I have no idea what to do for my project, but I'll figure out something I suppose, I'll have about a week to do it when I get back, along with my Tech... :/   Its going to be a busy week...   On to other things..      Another fact about the cousin I have noticed is her aversion to hair...   Yep...  hair    No problem if its on your head, but if you get hair in say the bath tub, she'll start screaming as soon as she sees it...      I beginning to wonder if "She's 2!" is actually still a usable excuse...      Meh...
