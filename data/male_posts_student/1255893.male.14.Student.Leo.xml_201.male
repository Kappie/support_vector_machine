So as I stand there (gawk-eyed) she actually turns to me and smiles. Not one of those fake smiles either. I wasn't able to talk right for about a minute.   After school was the 1st half of the squad competition (between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd periods.) If we didn't get 1st place then hell has just frozen over. I really don't mean to brag, but even the Battalion Commander and 1SG Sullivan were astonished. I still have to give props to the other companies, cus it takes a pretty big set to get out there.   Good grief, must do homework.
