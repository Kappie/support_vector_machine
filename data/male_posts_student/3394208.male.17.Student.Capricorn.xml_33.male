Catching my breath is the term I use when the world gives up on me.  Can you love or not? The truth finds all of us eventually.   I don't mind taking lives I find.  They all shine in my pocket at night.  You wonder why your always alone.  You never fit in you never could find a home,  and I don't need to second guess why,  your eaten by the anger and it makes it so hard to....   Love to love to love ya..ooh ooh   And please don't let me go, and please don't tell me no (who me yes you)
