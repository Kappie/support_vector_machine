    
       I had a recurring dream last night that my bedroom was the CNN.com home page, and my bed was where the main picture would be. And the CNN.com producer kept coming in and moving things around in my room as the stories updated. And he told me to move but I wouldn't, and so the main picture on CNN.com all last night was me sleeping. But I think for drama they put up the caption "Al Qaeda hostage." And of course it was night, so the picture was taken in that green night shot mode.  I woke up, and I *knew* my bedroom wasn't the CNN home page, and yet it just made so much sense. And I thought, maybe my bedroom *is* the CNN home page.  So I was very confused all last night.
