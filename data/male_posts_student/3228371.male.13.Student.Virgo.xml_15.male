My S-D people will know what I mean but the non-SDs won't. Just don't worry your asses off trying to figure out what I mean by that. Be satisfied with what you have. Anyway, back to band practise... We had a great time. Jammed, cuddled, jammed, ate, jammed, and jammed some more. Sounded great. :) But...! I had a headache~ Loud sound caused my headache to worsen. Drums AND electric guitar... all turned to the max... ouchiezZ~ >o  Went to bed at 5AM last night... [- -] [_ _] [- -] [_ _] Bad me... Shouldn't have gone to bed so late. Well, actually I went to bed around 11PM last night... but just didn't  sleep ! Spent all night thinking about stuff. I guess I just haven't been able to get a decent shut eye lately... I'm sure I'd sleep pretty well on [NT]'s shoulder. Haha! Anyway... I'm still smarting from the headache... Blah. I miss [NT]... Hee hee~   So yeah... I'll probably bitch here and just let everything out here too... instead of bitching at people. Major PMS. Haha! Anyways... Yeah... I'd probably bitch here a bit... only a bit. Skin deep bitching. Get what I mean? Won't go into too much detail. Just enough. I'll leave the others to SD. :P If my MTF/GFJ people don't know what I mean by SD, it's alright... I might not tell my MTF/GFJ people about this one... 'cos they know everything else from SD. Haha! This stuff is blah. Muahahahaha! If you're reading this and you're clueless, just shake it off and read on! Haha!   GUYS... LISTEN UP OVER HERE...  So yeah... one thing that guys should know... [certain guy(s) in particular] I don't know how else to say this but I'll be speaking on behalf of 99.999% of the girls/girlfriends out there in this entire world... (or just Richmond Hill... haha) Okay... back to my speech... "One thing that guys should know is..." we get jealous! Haha! Yes, strange but true! You know what? Blah! These weird guys that God put here to piss us off and cheer us up after pissing us off need to find out sooner or later. Hee hee~ Yeah, yeah... maybe you kiddies get jealous too sometimes... but hey, you're not the only ones! From reading my friends' blogs, we all seem to get jealous every so often! When, you may ask? When you pay more attention to other girls than us! When you flirt with other girls in our faces! (Or behind our backs) When... O__o" Shit! I think I've run out of "when's". Umm... WHEN YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO US! Yeah... something like that. See? I've been doing my homework/researching! Hee hee~ Anyways... Yeah... just so you kiddies know...! :) So watch out ! :P Watch yourselves ;) LmAozZ~ JkzZ~! But yeah... the truth :P  Ahhh! Gotta take a shower... I'll blog later... *mwahzZ* XOXO~ Peace.
