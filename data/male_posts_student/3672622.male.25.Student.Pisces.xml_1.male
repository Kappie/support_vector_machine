I am tired of belly aching over this particular theme, but it is on the top of the mind throughout the day.  Had a physics test today, it went well I suppose.  Enough of the scholastic talk!  I still have a crush on that same girl, but I don't believe she returns the same feelings.  I am getting used to the disappointment around here.  So depressing, but I am still sane and my jeans are dry today.  Life is never too bad, Well at least I have my books.  Well I guess this is good-bye.  Don't forget that casserole dish you let me borrow.  That squash casserole recipe  you gave me was to die for.  You are such a peach.  Well check ya later.
