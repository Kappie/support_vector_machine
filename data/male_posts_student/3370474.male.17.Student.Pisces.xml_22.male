I don't feel as if she cares about me anymore. Anytime I make reference to being depressed, she brushes it off or does nothing to help me. Yet if someone else tells her they are depressed, then they get so much attention, she cares about them. I'm sick and tired of being second and being a no one to her. If things don't change in the coming weeks, I will take my life.     As an old philosopher once said, "To live is to die and to die is to live." (Or was it a philosopher who said that? I know not anymore).
