And let's not kid around: taking a one-hour in-class closed book short answer exam (1/3 of my grade) immediately followed by the six-hour take-home open book essay portion of the exam (2/3 of my grade) is not so much fun.  Where did the day go?  Draining.  Very draining.  And an eight-hour take-home awaits me on Monday.  Fun stuff.
