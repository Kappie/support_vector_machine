This is in comparison to the account from the  urlLink Chicago Tribune .    For those who believe that the news media is interested in providing an unbiased Truth, I wish that  urlLink Fox 7 News  put archived clips of their newscasts on the internet so you could see blatant pro-war bias in news coverage.  For now, you have to trust me.  Last night's local Fox affiliate showed a piece on the anti-war rallies around Amercia.  It started with footage of the rally in New York, with the quip, "Rallies across America today as anti-war protesters came out in the thousands.  But not everyone was on the same page."  Follow that with a picture of a bearded, strung-out old man smiling and shouting, "Don't pay your taxes!"  Cut to a shot of police officers looking concerned.  Quote:  "But some fear that these protests are a detriment to national security."  Cut to a congressman talking about how paying these police costs money and manpower that could be used to fight domestic terrorism.  Cut to shot of people in front of a car racing track.  "And around the US, a number of groups have popped up to show their support for the President."  Cut to blonde woman holding baby.  "I support the President.  We're a military town, and of course we're going to support our boys in blue."  End segment.    So in that segment, they quoted one person from each movement; for the Pro-America folks, the epitome of womanhood.  For the anti-War folks, a buffoon.  They spent more time with the pro-America protesters, even though their numbers were dwarfed by the Anti-war protesters.  And they questioned the cost of these protests by saying it could fuel terrorism.  But they never questioned the cost of war.    A logical argument here would be this:  "Well, 75% of people support war. So don't you give 75% of the time to pro-America?"  You would, if stats were black and white.  But you have to look at the question being asked:  "Do you support President Bush in his Iraqi endeavor."  How I see it, there are 25% of Americans who do not support him and are willing to fight it; the 75% include those who support him as well as those who don't but are resigned to war because we're in it.  That's why the numbers shot up 25% since Wednesday.  It's not because we have more evidence now, it's because we're at war, and a lot of people don't think anything can be done about it, so why not get on the winning side.
