       
      I'm thinking of a GameBoy Advance.  There are lots of cool old school games, like Pac man, Donkey Kong, some Mario games, Zelda games, Tony Hawk (not old school, but very cool).  Also, The Legend of Zelda:  a Link to the Past is one of my all-time favorite games.  I also value mobility in my electronic devices (hence my very portable  urlLink powerbook ).  The only question in my mind is whether or not I'd play it enough to warrant it.  I don't play my GCN a whole lot right now, as it is.  I guess that's not the worst thing in the world, though!
