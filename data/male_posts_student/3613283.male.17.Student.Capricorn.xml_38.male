I've spotted a rather optimistic yet realistic analysis on the Iraq situation by Joshua Muravchik, a resident fellow at the American Entreprise Institute.  He concludes by saying  "The shining model that Washington once hoped it could make of Iraq has shown itself to be an illusion. Still, if an elected government follows, and with it the emergence of a more open and livable society than Iraq had known before, then Bush's strategy may yet be on the road to success."
