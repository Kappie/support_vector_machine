(now i'm not sure that i'd send this into the paper actually i know i won't because i'll be swearing and they wouldn't use it) stupid little shits they have no right to complain about what they have to put up with. i mean for fuck sakes there's almost no week that goes by that the little fuck wits don't throw an assortment of puddings, sandwiches, and any other food stuffs they can get their grubby little hands on. then there's the fact that they contribute to about 80% of the mess in the school ( i know because i'm one of the janitor and i keep tabs). and as for the pushing them around thing...kinda hard not to when they're running full tilt in a crowded hall way and trying to find short cuts and BAM they collide, face to knee and fall down. you know i'd write more but i'm not in the mood. i need to think more on this. -Matt
