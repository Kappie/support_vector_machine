An adventurous game, I have already spent 3 weeks on it and I have not yet reached half stage.    This game was made for the Nintendo 64 console in 1995. Even though made almost a decade ago, it has decent graphics and the sound effects and music are just fantastic. It still remains one of the most popular games for N64 console.   Thanks to certain good  urlLink N64 emulators  and  urlLink walkthroughs  (and less work load in office ;-), I have been able to enjoy it on my pc.    This added with the fact that there have not been any good movie releases since lakshya, there is really not much stuff to blog.
