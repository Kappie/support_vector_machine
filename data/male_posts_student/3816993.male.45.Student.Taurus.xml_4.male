While doing some catching up on my blog-reading I happened upon this  urlLink post  by Philocrites regarding a recent report made by the  urlLink Commission of Appraisal  of the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA). In an interview with the Boston Globe, Earl Holt, minister of King's Chapel and chair of the Commission, is asked whether the UUA has gone too far with its diversity. Holt replied, in part,  "I'm ready to defend now the hypothesis that Unitarian Universalism as it presently exists is not in any meaningful way . . . a continuity of either of the traditions" from which it sprung. Embracing all theological viewpoints — "at some point, pandering would not become too strong a word" — the UUA has lost the sense of unity that underlies community, Holt argues.  Elsewhere, while skimming through the  urlLink Jewish Reconstructionist Federation  site, I came across an article entitled  urlLink “Who is a Reconstructionist Jew?”  On the side bar is the phrase:   The past has a vote, not a veto.   In addition, the question of diversity at the cost of losing a sense of the movement’s past and distinctiveness is reviewed in an article entitled  urlLink "The Evolving Face of Reconstructionism"  in the online magazine  urlLink Reconstructionism Today . Here’s an interesting quote:  Professor Eisen noted that Kaplan  [founder of the Reconstructionist movement – my addition]  was insistent on a "maximalist Judaism," with Torah, interpreted in a contemporary light, providing a way of life. This maximalist approach remains central to Reconstructionism, particularly in our approach to Jewish "values-based decision-making," which has increasingly become a trademark of our congregations. Its paradigmatic model consists of:  •	Study of Jewish sources, traditions and practices.  •	Study of current information from the social and natural sciences.  •	Reflection on personal and communal values.  •	Analysis of the impact of each possible decision on each affected party.  •	Democratic and inclusive processes that maximize the number of participants along the way to a final decision.   It seems that Friends in the liberal branch of Quakerism attempt to at least try and include many of the same things mentioned in the above quote: we study Quaker sources, traditions, and practices; we attempt to be aware of information from the social and natural sciences; we reflect and seek Divine Guidance on personal and corporate values; we attempt to discern the impact of our decision making process; and we seek a  urlLink sense of the Meeting  as a way to make a decision.  And yet, do we do this? It seems that in the interest of diversity our Meetings and organizations have studied and sought Quakers sources, traditions and practices (I include the study of the Bible as well as the readings of earlier generations of Friends) less and less often. Perhaps the phrase “past has a voice, but not a veto” should read “What past? No need to fear a veto!” for us liberal Friends. More and more new comers to Quakerism (and I refer only to the liberal branch here) have less understanding of its traditional beliefs and practices; and its children and youth are left with the impression that as long as they are kind, pacifist, and form their own religious opinions they are Quakers. This amorphousness results in many of our young people drifting away to other traditions that offer a more solid understanding of its beliefs and practices (e.g. Roman Catholicism or Buddhism) or to rejecting organized religion altogether (ironically enough given that many of their parents came to Quakerism due to their rejection of organized religion). New comers, on the other hand, mistakenly translate the fact that Quakers don’t have creeds to mean that we don’t have any doctrines or beliefs (other than the overly used “that of God in everyone” and the even less specific “the Light”). Thus, they spend their time amongst Friends discovering and creating their own belief systems (if any at all) and, if they choose to join, wind up expecting (sometime demanding) that the Religious Society of Friends shift and change to accommodate their unique, idiosyncratic belief system.  But, what to do? Where do we “draw the line”? These are difficult questions since Friends have a history of being so rigid and doctrinaire that for a period of time they “disowned” (read: excommunicated) thousands of its members.   Have we gone too far the other way? The struggle is to find a way that it neither too unbending nor too yielding (for the sake of individualism and diversity). At a minimum Meetings and organizations need to become reengaged with Friends’ past through ongoing Quaker 101 studies for newcomers, Bible and Faith  Practice studies, and children and youth programs that specifically teach the very same things in a way that younger folks can appreciate. (And I can just hear someone in the choir loft yell out right now, “Good luck!”)
