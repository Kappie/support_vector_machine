These little dudes look like weird feathered dinosaurs. I was working with one in the lab, trying to get him to eat on his/her own out of the dish that I had placed in its holding box. That was a trip. At first, there was no reation to my offers of fish pieces. I would have to force em down its throat. I would check on him every hour and after the first visit he was catching on. I would wave the fishies in front of him and he would snatch it out of my hand. I did that a few times, then I waved the fishie and dropped in the dish. Viola! The food dish was discovered. That was cool.  Oh, by the way, I am on song 501 now.  Today, I started getting into the swing of running my own shift at the rescue center. Brad was my assistant today and we had everything ready to go early this morning for all the babies jays, finches, doves, and mockers. We had two admits during my shift. One was a little female house finch, the boy, probably about 8yrs old, that brought it in was awesome. His mom had drove him in and she could hardly speak english but the boy was busting out the story to me. They were walking and he saw this bird flopping around so he picked it up and took it home. haha. His mom wasn't to trilled about having a wild bird in the casa so she drove him to see us. I took the bird back and transfered him to his new basket home. I went out to answer a few questions and the boy told me he loves animals and that he doesn't like to see them hurt. DAMN! That seriously touched me. I told him the same thing, that I felt the same way. His mom said he wants to be a vet and I said, awesome, help him along the way.  I hope your dream comes true little antonio vasquez. ( I had to euthanize the bird later - what a bummer....) Next bird was a little bad ass, this dude found him in their pasture on the ground. A fucking baby Great Horned Owl a little larger than a softball. He had some giant feet on him too. I did the exam, he looked good, gave him some pedialite and called the raptor lady. Come to find out, we try to get these little dudes back in their original nest or a nest with some babies of the same general age. Unfortunatly we can't teach them how to hunt, so they don't do well in rehab. That made for a fun morning, I rushed out to home to get my Zales clothes on and get to work. I hurried over there to get started on doing NOTHING! What a waste of time. I worked with this chick named Carolyn that I totally pissed off the last time I saw her. We got into some discussion about why I don't care about people's lives. I do, but it is generally people I have woven some sort of relationship with, not random people I meet at work or on the street. She said, "If I die in six months, will you go to my funeral or just say, 'Oh, that was someone I worked with...' " I would say the later. I don't care that much I guess.  I love my friends and family, I am cautious of strangers.   current mood: geeky current music: Jawbreaker - Million
