And if I dont. Well...Im a gamblin man. Im willing to take a risk. Although it seems I have been taking risks this entire time and I have got shot down every time. Probably because I am so gosh darn unlucky. But hey it happens right? Sure it does. It always does. In case in you havent figured out by now...by life has taken a dramatic turn for the worst. But Im not one to sit down and take all of this. I am standing up against this so I can make my life better. It is going to take a lot of work and concentration. But...I am willing to work for what I want. Nothing comes free and easy to me anymore. I guess that is because I am not a kid any more. Ya know when you are a kid, you got it soo easy. When you're scared you can run and hide behind mommy or daddy. Mommy and daddy are always there for you. Or at least they were always there for me. Some people arent as fortunate. But I was lucky. I had parents that cared for me and watched over me. Anyways...when you're a kid....life is easy. You get what you want. No car insurance payments, jobs, telephone bills, utilities. You dont worry about that. I am growing up and I finally realize that life is getting tougher. And ya just gotta roll with the punches. Well lately I havent been rolling with the punches. I have been letting the punches hit right in my face. And let me tell you....it hurts. But the thing is ya gotta keep living. And the people who say otherwise are the ones who throw their lives away and go suicidal. But I choose to keep living. Ya take the good with the bad. Everybody gets the blues ya know. And without the bad times....it wouldnt make the good times so good ya know. For me at least, when bad things come around, good things come around eventually. Sometimes in small amounts and sometimes in great blessings. I have received blessings this past month. I cant deny that. But I have also gotten screwed over. I didnt screw myself over. My stupidity didnt do this to me. It was simply fate. Fate has a way of kicking me where it hurts. And when fate teams up with bad luck....thats pretty much an unbeatable combo. No denying that. But I do know one thing out of all of these bad things that have happened to me in the past days. I do know that 2 things help me deal with all of this and keep my on the ground. 2 things so special that they make me happy no matter what I am feeling inside. The first thing is music. Music is a lot of my life. My passion. It never fails to help me and is always there for me. The 2nd is a person. A real good friend of mine. The smallest thing this person does sets my heart at ease. And I am not going to tell you who it is. Because I am sure this person doesnt want publicity. And I just like to leave ya guessin. LOL! Well I guess I have been rambling for quite a while now. Sorry....I just had to get some of this stuff off of my chest cuz it was cloggin my brain and I couldnt think straight. Thats what this thing is good for I guess. And I am going to leave with one of my favorite quotes. Here it goes: "Love is always patient and kind.   It is never jealous.  Love is never boastful nor conceited.  It is never rude or selfish.  It doesn't take offense.  It is not resentful.  Love takes no pleasure in other people's sins  But, delights in the truth.  It is always ready to excuse,  to trust, to hope,  and to endure whatever comes."    Well thanks for listening to me. I had fun rambling. Have a good day. Cyaz!
