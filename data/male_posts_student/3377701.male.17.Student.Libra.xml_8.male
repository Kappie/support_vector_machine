Yeah yeah many of u will argue that it's nothing different from college back home but, i had 8 months holiday so... =P hehe. It was so damn boring i had to turn out my ipod during HOI class ( that's history of ideas ). I planned to stay up late to chat wif my friends back home but damn the internet had to malfunction. How unfortunate. That's why i didnt post anything on Thursday. The next day was camp. It was held at Rawson Village, no idea where it is myself. At first , we we're all really unhappy about the camp. Karen and Jenshen told us how boring the place was and how dull it would be. They really turned us off. Thank god things turn out differently ( Explained later ).  It was about 2 hr's drive from Melbourne to get to our destination. It wasn't too cold, we we're then allocated to our rooms. We had lunch, fish and chips. Yummmmmm.....free meals hehe. The next activity sounded boring at first, it was drama activities. But it turned out to be good fun, we had to act out 5 slides of still pictures at a certain location. And of course with a story behind it. Each group had their own ideas and all of them were unique and very hillarious. Our's was about me and my wife having a honeymoon at a luxury resort, and were later attacked by a shark ( How sadistic ) The next activity was bushwalking , probably the most boring activity at the camp. It was just a really really long walk through the forest with nothing too exciting. But we chatted on the way so it wasn't too bad. Ironicly after dinner, we had to best activity at the camp. Bush dancing. Something new. Something cool ;). It's hard to describe the dance, they taught us quite a number of it. Its kinda like a party dance, like dance dance dance then switch partners and it goes on and on. So basically we get to dance wif all the gurls hehe. Everyone was sporting, everyone participated. It was really great, we didn't want to stop, but we had to. But the fun didn't end there. We we're playing around wif the basketball a little , and then the gurls suggested to play captain ball. Not a bad idea, we thought. And it wasn't. We had heaps of fun , and the gurls turned out to be more aggresive than the guys. Scary. We could have went on forever , but kafaii got a cramp, and it was then only that we realised it was midnight already. I made a lot of new friends , and slowly we're getting closer to each other.  Next morning, woke up freezing. The wind was blowing hard, and the air was cold as ice. The schedule was like NS , meal - activity -tea - activity - meal - and so forth. We were seperated into four groups, each doing different activites at the same time. My group was really sporting. We got together really well. We did high ropes , something i missed out in NS. It was scary at first , and it really hurt my hand. It felt fiery after that. Later, we played captain ball , AGAIN. Our lecturer in charge joined us, making things a little more interesting. We did the flying fox ( its starting to really sound like NS huh ) And my favourite , basketball !!!. There's this Japanese girl , she's really good in basketball. She plays for the Osaka Sabers. Wow. Hehe. It was great to shoot some hoops again, its been like a month ? Ohhhh it felt good. Next up was the mini-olympics. It would have been fun if it wasnt for someone in my team who is a real pain in the a**. Just thinking of him pisses me off. At first , the events sounded real serious, like 100m dash , high jump and stuff like that. Turns out things were different , like the long jump, was actually the limbo. Haha. It was quite fun, and our group turned out second. We we're awarded a lollipop each. Hehe. During intervals we play ping pong and some football. I earned myself a new nickname , chicken wings. It's spreading like wildfire , and i'm always the joke. So what else is new? Oh , and i spotted a koala hanging on a tree that night. Not something you see everyday huh.  The start of a new day,  and i was feeling like an eskimo. We had to pack our bags , it was the last day of camp already. After breakfast we were seperated into our four groups again for some kind of competition. It consists of 4 mini games, and the points were added up to judge the champion. And guess whose group won =P We had teamwork , we worked hard , and enjoyed it at the same time. Our prize was a packet of Maltese , something i wanted to try for quite some time. ( It's choc btw ) We had tea , and we had time for just one more activity , the low ropes. No competition , just something to test our balance and stuff. Wasn't too interesting , but it was a good way to kill time. After lunch , it was back to Melbourne again. We got together wif our college friends for dinner, and we ate Indonesian food. Sigh time flies so fast when you're having fun. Tomorrow's the start of a tight schedule......
