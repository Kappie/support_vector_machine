Often, the butterfly doesn't know that it has been caught, it's perfectly content no matter what. The catcher then puts the butterfly in a jar for a while, to study it.  just remember: most butterflies that are caught end up with pins sticking through them, trophies of the catcher as he hunts down another helpless victim.  but there is one catcher who doesn't use a net, and he has seen the most beautiful butterfly of all...  but there is one problem: this butterfly has already been caught in a net, and she seems perfectly happy to remain in that net forever, she can't even see it.  but our catcher still tries. If he used a net, he knows he would have a good chance of catching this butterfly, and he would definitely be able to catch any other one he wished. But he knows, you should never settle for less when it comes to butterfly catching.  he will not settle for less than this butterfly, nor will he settle for more, because there is no butterfly more beautiful than this one. But he refuses to use a net out of fear that it might hurt the butterfly, or even worse, scare her away.  so instead he holds out his hand, with a small bit of sugar on it, hoping that the butterfly will come to him of her own free will, because he knows that this is not something that can be forced on someone.  but the butterfly flies off, she can't even see him standing there. He follows as best as he can, but it's no use, he can barely keep up with her.  he continues to follow as fast as he can, heedless of where his feet take him. He knows that he may very well stumble off a cliff and fall to his death in this chase, but it doesn't matter. If he can't catch this butterfly, he'll die trying.  and so the butterfly flies around, still trapped in her jar. She could get out if she really wanted to, all butterflies can, but they can never see the jar until it's too late.  and our catcher continues, he doesn't want to stick the butterfly in a jar of his own, or pin her up behind glass. He just wants her to land on his shoulder, and comfort him as he wanders.  he knows he has very little hope, he knows that the butterfly probably won't see him, but he's going to keep following her wherever she goes.  he doesn't know whether or not she wants out of her jar, he just wishes she would open up her sees and see him.  he'll make it his life's goal, catching this butterfly. He's going to follow her forever, watching out for her whether she cares or not...  and so he continues to follow her, follow the butterfly, and finally, he gains some courage, and he gets closer to her...  and she sees him, she finally begins to open her eyes and see him. But... She can only see him as a friend, and nothing more. She still has no reason to abandon the one who has already caught her and go to him, because she is happy as she is...  when he first found that she had already been caught, he began to slip, he stumbled as he followed her, and he fell off a Cliff. He was falling, tumbling, turning over and over in turmoil when a white dove flew past and revealed to him that the cliff wasn't all that tall after all, and he landed on his feet with the help of the dove, and he continued to follow the butterfly, to watch her more closly, if only from a distance.  if only he could get her to open her eyes farther, she might be able to see him, the real him. just once he would like that, he would like that very much indeed. even if it means he has to fall off another cliff for it to happen.  but he is much closer to her now, close enough to talk to her, perhaps even close enough to tell her how he feels. But...would that really fix anything?  no, it wouldn't, it would only complicate things even more than they already are. as he saw earlier, she is already perfectly happy to remain where she is forever. the only thing that mattersd to him is for her to be safe and happy, her happiness comes first, before everything else, before even his own life, if needs be.   and so he... He does what will hurt him the most, he...stops chasing her. He just lets her flutter off. he'll still be there if she ever wants to return, but he isn't going to force her. it's because he understands now, he understand just what it means to truly love someone, he understand that if you love someone, you want the best for them, you want them to be truly happy above all else. and that is how he feels about this butterfly, he truly does love her, more than he could have possibly thought it was possible for anyone to love anything.   and so she flutters off into her future, and he remains behind, knowing full well that there is nothig that could possibly be any more painful for him. But he also know that it is best for her if her life remains simple, she is happy where she is so why ask her to change anything?  and he speaks to her, even though she has gone and can no longer hear him...  "Please, please forgive me but i do love you. please understand how i feel about you. even if you can't love me back, just know that i will always love you.i only want you to be happy, if you want me to just leave and not bother you asgain...then i will do as you wish. i have no desire for you to be happy, just please grant me this one wish of mine: ...please continue to grow, grow and become stronger and more beautiful, continue to grwo forever..." and so he watches her fluttering off on those delicate wings into the sunset, and...He smiles slightly, as a tears rolls down his face...  "i love you, i always have, and i always will. i will wait for the time that you fly to me, even if that time never comes, i will await you forever, because some things are worth waiting for, even if they never do come to pass."  ...so were his parting words to her
