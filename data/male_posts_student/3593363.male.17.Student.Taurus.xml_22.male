Thne we went to Aarons and hung out with everyone. We had our pants down, but other than that it was pretty boring. Then when i dropped ian off at home, we went inside and made tacos with steak.Tacos...  Tomorow I get some free time, for the first time in  a long time. Maybe I can do something about my life. Probably not.
