Today started out awesome cuz Tyke listened to his new mix and parked in his new spot.  Then he had to get out a minute early to go get his new schedule which kinda sucks but not really.  It is just different.  He doesn't have any new girls in his class unfortunately.  It is always fun to make a fresh start with a girl that doesn't exactly know you that well but kinda knows who you are.  The problem is that only happens with girls that aren't in his grade.  Like Shawna for instance would be an example.  But it is still fun.  Basically Tyke likes to flirt with girls that are younger than him but are hot.  Sounds kinda perverted but what guy doesn't want to?  Tyke just has the balls to do it you could say.  Tyke's 4th period is now awesome.  Not only has Amed joined the fray but mAnus has left and they switched seats.  Tyke now sits as far away from the teacher as possible.  He sits with Amed, Dr. Phil, Dotti, Purdy, and Beaner now.  A marked improvement over his last spot.  Tyke has now written a couple more haikus...pretty much the same as his last ones with one of them being a little more explicit.  But they are still pretty fun to write.  He loves letting his imaginative side run wild as you may have noticed.  Seldom is he more pleased than when he has written something really funny or deep or just something really entertaining.  Well here is a new topic of conversation.  The Sly Lion game on Friday.  Girls are at home and boys are at Sly Lion.  Now Tyke has people from both sides telling him to go to their game.  This is a tough choice.  On one side there are all of the stupid people who go to the boys games and would think Tyke's cheers stupid so they wouldn't get pumped up.  On the other hand the girls don't need the support as much as the boys cuz they are a better team.  Tyke does want to rent an eagle suit or something like that as that would be hella tight.  He knows he won't but still it would be awesome.  He is just looking forward to that game and all of the responsibility that comes with it (which is really none since it is Tyke and he doesn't have any responsibility to the team).  But Tyke's cheering is heard loud and clear.  Make no mistake about that.  He is one hell of a cheerer.  Damn, this sucks...for the last like week Tyke hasn't had anything good to talk about in his blog other than his daily recounts.  And that bothers him.  He wants to talk about feelings again cuz he misses that.  Some people might have hated those days but Tyke felt better after talking about stuff.  However, he has decided to actually keep some of his life private.  Which is probably for the better.  Now, no need to ask what he is keeping private because he won't tell you.  But just know that it is private.  Anyway, this is a really short blog cuz it is pointless to ramble on.  Nobody would be interested in anymore jumbled phrases and garbled words.  So go off to bed and sleep like Tyke will be doing soon.  To sleep off this sickness he is feeling come on.  But should you want, "If you want my body...and you think I'm sexy..."  Leave the rest to your imagination ladies and gentleman.  You know what Tyke's talking about.
