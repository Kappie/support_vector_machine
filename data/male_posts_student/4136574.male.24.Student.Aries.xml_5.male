Stupid me for not putting it in its case last night.  Anyway, that's my morning.  I hope I have the money to fix the window and get a new CD player.  I will try to wipe my harddrive and hope my laptop works today, but I think it's dead.  Too bad I don't have a birthday or something coming up so I can get a new laptop.  I don't think I can afford one otherwise.
