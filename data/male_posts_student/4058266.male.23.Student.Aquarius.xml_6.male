I believe that this break-up is for the best for us, just so we can finish our goals in life, but also for many other reasons. I know you feel rejected in this time of need but do understand... That is not my intention. I truly believe that this is what I need right now. All the things that I used to do like, calling you just to say I love you, the times I would to hold your hand, resting my head on your shoulder when I'm tired, cutting my hair and waiting to see if you to notice. All of these little things I felt you took advantage of, but you know what... It's okay now. I have accepted it but still feel numb about the whole thing. I know that there is more to think about, but this is the only thing on my mind. At least our break-up wasn't on bad terms... I tell you boo, I still love you, I will always love you and I will always think about you.
