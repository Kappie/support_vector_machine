She doesn't even really teach us the stuff, she just goes over it. She doesnt even give us notes! A couple of weeks ago she made me take a quiz even though i was absent the class before, and i had no clue how to do the stuff on the quiz!  I got a 44 on it! I will probably get like a 70 this six weeks and its basically her fault! HOW CAN SHE TEACH ALGEBRA WHEN SHE CAN'T EVEN MULTIPLY 2*2*2!!!!!!!!!!!  Alright enough about me rambling and whining about how much mrs. Ryno sucks as a teacher.    Anyways, on friday, we had this really cool Dragon Fest day! We got the whole 2nd half of the day off!  And the really cool thing about it is i won this giant dragon by entering a raffle that was only 1 dollar a ticket! Hes so cool!  Hes such a chick magnet! ;)   That is all for now, i will post more tomorrow, gtg finish doin hmwk  Lata!  ~Eric
