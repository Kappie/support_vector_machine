Number 1! Mercury! Mercury! Run! Run! Run! And if we lose it goes liked this: It is Ok! It is all right! We will tried our best next time! And if we got first it goes liked this: 123 321 Mercury! Mercury! Number 1! Or: Hip Hip Hurray! Hip Hip Hurray! Hip Hip Hurray!   And the best girls and all team is MERCURY! Hip Hip Hurray! Hip Hip Hurray! Hip Hip Hurray!    The lamest sport day too!
