I woke up and asked my mother to sign my declaration form??? Don't know what's gone into me. But I'm having quite a body ache, probably cause of the basketball and running yesterday. Then I watched Jimmy Neutron the Movie for a while.hehe...it's quite nice actually, until my father turned it off to watch his own show. Argh...actually, it's ok la...hehe. And somehow, I ended up playing World Cup and Age of Empires online, so you can imagine how bored I was. But guess I'll have to start with my homework soon. Now, I realised that quite a few people around me are "falling in love" hmm...can help some of them with some things I learned from the book I'm reading. But guess it's quite weird for me to do so anyway. I just hope that they'll understand what does true love mean. To me, one perfect example of love is set by what Jesus did for us. Yupz...at first I thought it was quite weird too, my mindset was," Hey! No way man! They are two different kinds of love!!!" But now, I realised that there is only one true meaning of love. That is doing what's best for the other person, and placing the person's spiritual growth first. Ya...that's my opinion. And Christ did just that. Yeah! Anybody want to know more can ask me. Actually, it'll be better if you read "I kissed dating goodbye" by Joshua Harris yourself. And his second book is good too. Ya... OK...back to reality. I'm so bored...argh...then jie cannot even come down from her house, so it's like super duper boring. And no one to talk to also. haiz...I think I'm the kind of person who likes company. But today will be boring. OK, got to go and finish some work. I'll probably be back again tonight.
