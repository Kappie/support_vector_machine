As I walked towards the windows, I realized my roommates closet for a room had now expanded into something comperable in size to a hotel suite.  Looking back to the living room, I noticed my roommate's tv was in the place of our tv.  When I returned to his room, the big tv had grown and was firmly fit into an entire wall.  I went back to my room and dug around in my closet, suprised to find jerseys from all the teams The Great One played on (and an Alou jersey).  In my dream I thought that Dave Sliozis had left all his stuff in my closet.  I then went to the bathroom to find all of our pop strewn about the floor under the sink, and at just about this time, my roommates mother appeared out of nowhere and started yelling at me.  Then my alarm went off.
