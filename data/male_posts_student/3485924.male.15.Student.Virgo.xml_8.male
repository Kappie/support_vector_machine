I'm sorry for not updating while I was gone, but Ricardo has 56k and there were so many other things to do! I even got to go DDR ^_^    Ok, main things we did: Zelda, Gladius, Phantasy Star Online (Offline)    It was great. I had more fun than if you strapped a buffalo to a train and watched it speed away into the distan-- wait... that's not fun... well, you get the point. He showed me the game Gladius first. It's SO much fun. Especially the fact that it's two player, up to four. It's a game about gladiators (duh), but the fun spin was that it was an RPG like Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre (both games that I love). So much fun. You can FULLY customize every single gladiator that you have on your team. It was so much fun that at least 3 times we played it 6 hours straight before playing another game.    Second, was the Legend of Zelda. Which one you ask? Why, Ocarina of Time! Everyone says that it's the best one, and in my opinion, it is. I mean, it's only the game that's sold the most all around the world, but let's not let a little thing like that get in the way of our judgement ^_^    But seriously. I've never fully beaten that game before. I've played it many times, and I love the game. I know the WHOLE game like the back of my hand. I played on Ricardo's game (he was at the Water Temple) and beat it. It was much fun ^^    Then, there was Phantasy Star Online. Now, this game is fun. We played it offline however becasue first, he didn't have the adapter for online play, second, he wouldn't pay the money to play it online anyways. I really wish he did though. I can tell that online it would own so much that my eyes would fall out by the sheer number of hours we played it... ^^;;    Well... that just about sums up what we did. Oh, we also played  urlLink Dragon Court . He started playing again, and I just decided to do it since it takes about 10 minutes to play everyday and is pretty damn fun for being free.    Ok, that IS about it. There's nothing left to say. Which is good, because for once I ranted and I enjoyed it. Plus I did it fast enough to still have other things to do. Ooh! I have one little bit of good news left... I just saved a load of money on my car insurance by switching to Gieco! :P    Cya ^_^    PS:  urlLink Buy all our playsets and toys!
