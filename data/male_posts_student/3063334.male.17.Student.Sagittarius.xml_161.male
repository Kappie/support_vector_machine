I admit, last year was AMAZING compared to every other year I have been at Skyview, but there is still room for improvement. During cheerleading practice we were discussing different ways to implement more school spirit throughout Skyview. However, it's going to take a lot more than just 15 girls out on the sideline.  If anyone has any good ideas of how to get more of the student body involved, blog away! It will be greatly appreciated and we can have a super fun year next year being the old men (and women) on campus! Rachel Penny
