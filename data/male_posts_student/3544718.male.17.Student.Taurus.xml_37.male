Anyways, it hit me then, that I will never in my life win an argument with a girl. I will go to my grave without ever being able to say, "I won." I can't win w/ Kimmy, and I can't win w/ Christy (who are the 2 people I argue with the most). SO, I came up with a brilliant plan! I'm gonna go to Wal-mart tomorrow, and argue with someone I don't know! It will, of course, be a girl who I don't measure to be as quick as my friends. "Why a girl?" You might ask. Well, the answer is simple... I've won many arguments with men... that's no feat! I will triumph some female, somewhere! Ok, goodbye.
