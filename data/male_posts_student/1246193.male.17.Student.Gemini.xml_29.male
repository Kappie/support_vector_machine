I thought it was really good and I enjoyed it a lot.  I also enjoyed sitting in the massage chairs in Brookstone.  I did not enjoy changing on the bus.  We were told we couldn't change in the mall bathrooms.  Stupid liability issues. I like oldies.  I also have begun to enjoy the sound of disco and 70's music.  I am only about thirty years behind the rest of you.  I am ready for school to be over.  Campout this weekend.  It should be fun if it doesn't suck.  I am feeling the pressures of SPL (senior patrol leader).  Stupid people don't listen to what I tell them to do and then they wonder why they don't have any food to eat.  I met my sister's boyfriend half an hour ago.  Umm,  he is bigger than I am.  I am rather frightened by him.  From what my sister tells me he fights quite often.  He could definitely kick my ass.  Then again, a four year old could probably kick my ass.  I would rather not do the English project.  Gregg is going to have to be a girl ,  hahaha.  Mr. Chase is the only teacher I know that doesn't round grades up.  Today he gave me 93.74 percent.  It is a freaking 94 percent grade.  AHHHHH.  I need to pack for this weekend.   I realized today that I have a problem with sharing.  I don't know how to do it. I am still thinking about college and the many problems I have with it. I was thinking about living at college and it dawned on me, I will have to live in place with other people and probably have to share a bathroom with nine million other people.  I have NEVER had to share anything.  I have always had my own bedroom and bathroom.  I need my personal, sanitary space.  I also think that I have found another fear that has to do with the future.  Maybe I am not scared of the future at all.  I am scared of not having money.  I know it shouldn't be that important to me but I have never done without anything.  My parents have provided quite well for me and I don't know if I will be able to do the same.  I seriously wonder if I need professional help.  I worry so much about things I have no control over.  Worrying about the future should not interfere with my life.  I have problems.  Everybody has problems.  Sorry if my problems are boring to you but quite honestly I need a vent.  I try to have fun but everything I do turns into a chore.  That is why I need days like yesterday.  I wanted to roll down the hill but then I thought what if I hit my head on the concrete or rip my shirt or stain my pants.  So I sat on the side of the hill and watched everyone else roll down the hill.  Hhhhhhhhhh.  It was still fun though.  Actually,  Yesterday was a whole heck of a lot of fun!
