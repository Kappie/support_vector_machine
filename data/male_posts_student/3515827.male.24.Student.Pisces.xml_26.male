I also found out that it’s easy to find a sexual mate on this list.  The people are pretty skanky, though, and I think that there are a small number of people who keep on putting the same thing up.  Either they are big fans or just really desparate, it’s anyone’s guess.  My new favorite show is 90210…again!  I just found out that it shows on FX, and ever since then I have been avidly following the crazy adventures of Dylan, Brendan, David, and company.  I’m so glad that Brenda got booted from the show.  Regardless of being a bitch and a bad actress, she was also quite homely.  Andrea Zuckerman was trash, too.  She never belonged on that show, and outlived her pitiful usefulness quite some time ago.  Maybe I’m getting too involved in this.  In the process of trying to think of witty things to put in for the rest of the day, I have failed miserably.  I think that this means I am not as funny or as clever as I usually think I am.
