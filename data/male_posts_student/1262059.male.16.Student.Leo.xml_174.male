I recall reading an article on it... supposedly it's a creation between Spielburg and the late Kubrick. It's about a boy-robot who's programmed to love, and searches to become human...there were kinda two endings... one that Kubrick would've used, which was pretty good - though kinda sad, the second is a Spielburg twist at the end... it made the final ending kinda bittersweet, and I thought it was ok... though it would've been fine if they left it at the first ending.   I recall my mom asking me if I would want to go to Hong Kong by myself for a week like next year. I was indecisive.... I mean, it'd be a nice adventure and all, but my chinese is horrible and I think I'd feel very out of place.    ~Chronos (hopefully i'll dream dreams that can point me somewhere)
