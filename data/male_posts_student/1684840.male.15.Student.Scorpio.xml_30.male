When I was awoke by my alarm I found the garden flooded and the sky all grey.  It has been raining all day, some minor rumbles of thunder now and then, but nothing as major as last night.  The day was totally miserable and boring, but you can't really expect school to be fun I suppose.  Which reminds me, last day tomorrow!!!  Gonna be baby sitting tonight so I should get some more pocket money for my holiday to America, 6 days to go :D  Can't wait one bit...
