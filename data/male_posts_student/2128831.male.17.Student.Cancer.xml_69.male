Really he was replusive like he weighted a maximum of 100 pounds… I was like eww!  Anyways so he was working with this other guy, who wasn’t much better.  Well, Big Mama wanted to preorder a movie and they didn’t know how to work it.  None what so ever, like this kind of thing never happens… I mean who was in charge of their training and exactly what kind of training are they given, and then we found it, peicing together visual clues.  The femme one’s pant zipper was down, and well not some what all the way unzipped, sweat beaded on their faces and two waded-up napkins on the ground.  We we’re the only people in the store and it opened four minutes before we got in there… You tell me?     So, it is wrong to have a crush on the Schwans guy?  I mean he is like twenty-thirty something and I know he is gay, and I know there is very little that I can do with him or that I would do with him, but still I am attracted to him.  Not to downplay me and Fabi. I would never ever dream or fathom leaving my beautiful boi.  He means the world to me and in my eyes will continue to be the sexiest boi in the world.  And did I mention that he has this awesome aura and personality that brightens my day through one minute of being exposed to his radiant energy that I will call love?  So, yeah!  Words are lost, yet faith reassured You came and took me. Even though I've come undone. I wanna embrace in your love. ’Cause your love shinning so bright. I don’t feel no solitude, for I’m with you  You cast an undying love spell on me, And drowned me in your love, I cant believe how you made me feel. I wanna hold you tight And kiss you good night. I can never find a way out this, And I simply never want to. I'm not sure if I deserve your love, But you give me all of it.  Thank you for this, babe I can never untangle myself from this web, I simply love you so much. I can say 'I love you' a thousand and million times, but it still can never be enough to show, just how much I really really love you. And please don’t be dubious of my words I just can’t show you how much it’s true. I've left the past behind, And stepped into this beginning  Only with you in me. And Im going to carry on this journey.. With only you here beside me  I gonna show you my thoughts and words   How much I truly care   Baby you are the world,  I wanna make it all for you      What are you? You're a sac of consciousness separated from reality by a vibrating membrane only 2mm thick in most places called "skin." This skin is tissue that ends yourself and where begins your external world. This skin is an organ which itself breathes, but is sustained by the breath of your organism. This skin is made up of the same basic shit that makes up your internal organs and, most importantly, your brain. But, what's really interesting is to think about where your body ends.  Where does a body end? With your skin? Partially. But, do you feel wrapped up in a sac of skin? Or do you, like most people, feel that you are something esoteric and invisible, some strange entity almost "encased" in a shell that is neither part of neither said shell nor really, definitively contained within said shell? You absolutely know that when the shell dies, you (whatever that is) also die (or is at least unrecognizable). Yet, the most basic understanding of who you are is understood by your most basic relationship to the environment in which you exist. For most people, as thinking creatures, they "get off" by understanding their relationship to the environment by understanding their interactions with other people; to be without another thinking person would be HELL to most people, an existence WORSE THAN PRISON. However, interaction with the environment occurs on the most basic level, which is also a level that happens to be the most mind-blowing (and I mean "mind-blowing" in a good way! Don't take the following example "for instance," but take it "for all it's worth"... okay?)
