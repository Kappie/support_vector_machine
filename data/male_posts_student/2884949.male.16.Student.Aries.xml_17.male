Easter has too come and gone, nothing special happened there... humm, what else... oh, I have no chance in getting a girl friend (big suprise eh?).... ummmm... yeah, I think thats about it... now, to write more about the crap that has gone on.. oh, and my computer died, so I lost all my music and crap which sucks big time, cause now I dont really have anything to listen too!  driving... where to begin there.... you name it here in this pathetic little town, and I have driven by, or to it over the last few weeks.. its been pretty fun, yet got kinda old soon....  my birthday and Easter... what to say about those.. on my birthday, I still got quite a bit of money, which rocks... I got a bunch of crap, which is also pretty cool.... got some new earrings, no, not the gay kind, a bunch of Ninja Turtle stuff... umm.... Easter, that was pretty fun, and cool, went to eat dinner at my grandma's house...   well, ok, Im done now...  later  Jerry
