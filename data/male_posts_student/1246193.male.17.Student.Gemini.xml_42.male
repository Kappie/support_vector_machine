I am working for the secretary of state in the department of motor vehicles.  I was told I would be "processing license plates" and that is what I am doing.  The job, unfortunately, is not the excitement I was hoping for.  I look at the numbers on the license plate, I look at the numbers on the identification card, if they match, and they always do, I put the id in the the envelope on the license package and seal it.  I found that it takes me about 10-15 minutes to "process" 50 plates. I worked for about 7.5 hours today.  Today I processed approximately 1875 license plates.  The same thing over and over and over and over and over. . .
