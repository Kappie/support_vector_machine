I'm pretty sure it will be interesting, so don't worry about this being boring.  And as an informational note, I plan to make these posts as frequently as possible and as long as I can.  By long, I mean describe things as well as I can, and in a way that things and ideas are vivid and easy to understand.  This maybe pose to be difficult for me because I am not a very good writer, but I hope to have fun with this blog.  One main thing I hope to have at this blog is actual visitors.  It would be nice to get feedback from people on things I talk about.  That would be great, but to start out, I won't expect much as far as visitors.  This is a new blog, anyways.  I think I have talked enough about my blog and I should probably get on to actual blogging.  To start out tonight, I wanted to talk about the subject of woment and relationships.  I must honestly say that I do not have much experience in the field of relationships and women as I have only had one girlfiriend.  But I can honestly say by this, I have learned a lot.  Now, when I talk of women now, I'm not going to talk about women as if the things I describe are attributes of all women.  That would be hard to believe, since I do not have much experience to speak from.  That though, does not keep me from forming my own opinions about the subject of women.  I would probably tell you that most of my opinions tend to depend on my current mood.  Heh.  That would be true though.  But one could say what doesn't depend on your current mood?  That I cannot answer because I think opinions you form cannot go without consideration of your current mood.  And look at how much I have said without actually telling you what my opinion is on women.  I don't really want to begin to tell of my opinion on the subject because I am afraid to put something in stone.  I don't want to say something then a minute later change my mind.  With that said, I think it may be a while before I actually form an opinion.  Either that, or one day I'll be so moody I'll just want to rant and rave it all out in a short span of time so fast I won't be able to stop myself.  Heh.  That's enough for now, I think.  Next update will probably be on Monday.  I am not allowed to be on the computer on Sunday because of my mother's request.  I don't know why exactly though.  She just said it would be a good idea to give something up for a while.  That makes sense but I just got off restriction from the computer for three weeks.  I think she should probably be leanient and let me be on 24/7 if I wanted.  But oh well, that's just my opinion.  Good night.
