All right! yeah! Right now, i am slacking at home lah... just went through some Math notes... but still not feeling that confident for math tml... crap right?! haha.. yeah well... i wish didn't take math... oh well, but the choice has been made... so... got to work hard! haha... crap! on Fri is still the worst! GEOG! darn, it's probably the hardest paper that i'll ever have to take lah! Physical Geog is still ok... but... Human Geog has so much to cover! crap lah! but at least, there's this break that i have today to slack off and spend the time studying for my papers... ok... so it's not exactly slacking off... but hey, at least i get to wake up early and not have to sit for another dumb paper! haha... okok... i got to go and mug a little more!
