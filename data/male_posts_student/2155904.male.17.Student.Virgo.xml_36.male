He got home and changed for his first CE appointment at KING 5.  He then drove all the way to Seattle and to the Phi Kappa Psi frat house for his first meeting.  He met his mentor there (sports reporter/anchor Michael King) as they were doing a story on this world-class weightlifter from Newport High School who goes to UW.  He works out in the basement of his frat house which is an interesting story and the reason for KING 5's dedicating a story just to this.  Well this guy weighs 165 pounds and can dead lift (just pick up really) 550 pounds and benches 300 or so.  Those numbers may not seem like a lot but he only weighs 165 pounds.  Tyke has got a good couple of inches on him but is not nearly as ripped as him.  So they did the story on him and then when Michael was doing the "teaser" (the little clip that introduces the upcoming story when the news program is going to commercial) they decided to put Tyke to work.  First they just had him in the background shooting pool while Michael did the story.  Then they did some different shots and they had Tyke just playing along with Michael while he did the promo.  So whenever this story is played on-air Tyke should be on it.  Not a big part but its still cool.  Today he is gonna go back there and maybe help out some more with the NWCN sports broadcast tonight.  It should be a fun CE, especially cuz it has nothing to do with his actual topic.  Well then Tyke got home last night and went to the boys basketball game and then he came back home with some guys and they went and played midnight bball up at Sunny Hills.  Then they came back home and played some poker.  Then he went to sleep and woke up after 1 PM today.  That is pretty late for him.  But he does have ALL BREAK to sleep.  Whoo hoo!
