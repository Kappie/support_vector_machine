First of all, my friend from Vermont came down a few days prior to that, which is always a special event on my book. Secondly, Van Halen a night removed from playing at the Worcester Centrum Centre for their first show was playing there again that night, the only difference from the night before was that my friends and I were going to be in attendance. We have waited two months for this event and needless to say, the anticipation was all worth it. It was a great great show!  You knew it was going to be a good night when you can automatically get your seats upgraded. We did not even have to do anything. We got to our seats a full hour before the scheduled start of the show. Being primarily a hockey venue, we peered up on the Centrum scoreboard as they were advertising upcoming events that would get people to go to the Centrum now that hockey season was over. I saw that Madonna was playing the same venue the week after. I really didn't care, because for one thing, I was not a fan of Madonna or her music, secondly, the show on the night we were there would most likely blow that show out of the water.   The show's 7:30 PM scheduled start had passed, but not by much. The lights go out and in comes... the opening act. I should have known there was an opening act because the stage wasn't set up for a Van Halen show. For the most part, I could not make heads or tails as to what the opening band was playing. Given the fact that I have never heard of them before and they were playing original music, I still couldn't tell what it was. My friend, and fellow musician Dave (from Vermont) concluded that they would make a great bar band, but can't play larger venues because their set up just isn't that great. I agreed. I said that they meant well because they wrote and played good old-fashioned rock n' roll, but they should learn to control their volume and their set up because people just have a hard time hearing let alone listening to them. Big Masa, on the other hand, slept through the whole thing.  It was 8:30, the opening act was gone (Thank God!). I had to use the other facilities of the arena (i.e. I needed to take a leak), when suddenly the lights went out and I heard the scream "HELLO BABY!!!!" It was none other than Sammy Hagar! The opening of "Jump" played, and I ran back to my seat. It was the beginning of the greatest show that I had seen up til that point in my life. The stage was wonderfully set up and sound clarity was a lot better than that of the opening band (whose name, although I know will not be uttered at all). Van Halen continued to rock all evening, but what was most catching and a true tender moment was during the master, Eddie Van Halen's guitar solo. Eddie played the song "316", which was inspired by the birth of his son Wolfgang. He played it while sitting on the edge of the stage, he would then stop, but you could still here music. At that moment, I said to myself "where's the music coming from?" then out came Eddie's son Wolfgang playing the a replica of the guitar that Eddie was famous for playing. Wolfgang played the rest of the song while Eddie soloed to it. It was a truly tender father-son moment that at the time seemed so apropo, especially considering the fact that it was father's day.   The show ended (well for us anyway) after the band played "Panama", a song that I thought would make a great ending to a great show. The energy was all there. It was great! Even despite the fact that I missed Alex Van Halen's drum solo, which my drummer friend Dave would never let me forget, and I will never forget myself being in my obsessed with drums phase, the show was still the greatest I have seen. I have also learnt my lesson about consuming liquids before an important show. I shall never ever do that again. I took photos so that I may never forget. I doubt I will. Rock on, Van Halen!!
