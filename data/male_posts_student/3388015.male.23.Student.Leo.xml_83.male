We got back on the plane, and we taxied for an hour. So we were really late,Iwe got in around 10:45, rather than 9:50.   Cindy was at the airport, been there since 10:30, so she didn't have to wait very long. She was helping a French couple, since nobody else in the airport spoke French. We got our bags, went back to my place and Nola and mom went home. I have rats in my apartment now, Cindy's pet rats. They sqeek a lot.   Monday was a nice day. I got up at 10am and went to the bank to fix an error in a credit card payment. I accidentally paid off my credit card from the wrong bank account, so my account went negative (since I don't use this other bank account). So I got it fixed and went to the mall to return a pair of shorts I bought for my trip, but they neglected to remove the security tag. I went to BJs, got a trial membership (though I'm prolly going to get a real 15 month membership with Laura this or next week). I bought 15 gallons of spaghetti sauce, some cereal and other stuff. I went to Walmart, got the rest of my needed supplies and came back to the apartment.   Cindy was reading and we just hung out for a bit. I called Laura and asked her to come to my place after she got out of work, and she did. I gave her some stuff and invited her to go to my grandmother's for a picnic. We left around 5 after dropping Cindy off and spent the evening with my uncles, aunts, grandmother and family. My uncle, his wife and their kids are up from South Carolina for the week. It was nice to see them again. We had a lot of Italian food (none of us are Italian) and had a great truffle for dessert.   We came back to Rochester, Laura went home and the cat and I fell asleep around 11. I had a weird dream about something trying to choke me and I woke up when I threw the cat off my neck. Whoops! She promptly came back anyway. :)   Tuesday was pretty lame, but after work I worked out at the gym for an hour. I decided to start a new gym routine to see if it works. Walk an hour for lunch, Work out an hour after work, eat 2,000 calories a day. Hopefully I can lose this darn weight once and for all. My pants are tight again and I refuse to buy bigger clothes when I know that I used to fit into one size smaller!  Cindy and I hung out at the apartment, I did laundry and we watched a lot of reality tv last night. Everything from "Trading Spouses" to "America's Next Top Model" It was interested and I think they have us hooked. I hate loving tv... I feel like I should be doing something else!
