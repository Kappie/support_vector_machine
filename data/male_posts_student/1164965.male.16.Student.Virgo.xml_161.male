Thanks Mrs. VA for an awesome year and such a simple yet appropriate pair of final prompts.   As far as school spirit goes this last year was not only unprecedentend and uncharacteristic of Skyview, it was also PHENOMINAL.  The key was a group of kids, mostly seniors but several juniors and sophomores as well that were willing to set aside their images (rip up their cool cards *wink*) and have fun with outfits, chants, and the good feeling they got when Skyview won.  If we want to have that kind of a fall and winter sports season again it's going to take some leadership.  Kids quickly forget how much fun it is to get G'd UP from the feet up and yell at Prairie high school, but all it takes is a key figure like Jake Valentine this year to really motivate kids.  Cheerleaders keep up the good work, but help is needed to generate school-wide spirit.  Everybody keep blogging this summer!  I'm pretty sure we'll have a summer reading list so we can talk about that, but with each passing day, November draws closer.  Love Rob
