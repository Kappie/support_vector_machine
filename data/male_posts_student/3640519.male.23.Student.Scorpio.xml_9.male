Height of joblessness. Plan to read Economic Theory. *********************************************************** Today is a much better day. The sun has shown some mercy by going to  rest for a while behind the clouds. Yet I feel bad about leaving Dehradun at the cool foothills of the Himalayas and now sweating it out in MADras. I want to get on with some real work now but can't seem to get any. It seems it'll be so at least till July 1. Till that time I have to kill time.
