There's a good article on Kinky and his candidacy in the  urlLink NY Times .  Living in Austin, I hear the man's name occasionally, especially on  urlLink kvet radio , and I've seen his column in  urlLink Texas Monthly .    Would I vote for him?  Why not?  As the NY Times article notes, the Texas Governor's position is largely ceremonial, and Texas loves spirited governors ( urlLink Ann Richards ,  urlLink GW ); the current governor,  urlLink Rick Perry , is more than a little dull.
