I downloaded about 15 full Seinfeld episodes fom kazaa.  The FBI will probably show up and take me to prison.  I hope not.  I just like my Seinfeld.  I don't like to wait to when they play the repeats on TV.  So I stayed up until about 5 AM watching those episodes.  It was crazy.  Tomorrow I believe I will be going to work with my Dad.  I'm not sure why.  Well I do know why.  Partially because I stayed up so late.  Once on Friday then Saturday.  I don't know why.  I should probably go to be right now.  In fact I will.  Good night.
