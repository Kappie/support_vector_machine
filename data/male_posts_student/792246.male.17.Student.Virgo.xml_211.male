The funny thing, is apparently it's a remix of Komm Susser Tod, that classical song by...I forget who. Now I don't consider myself a classical music master, but it doesn't sound at all like Komm Susser Tod, but whatever.  Anyways, it's called Komm Susser Tod, sometimes Komm Susser Tod - Tumbling Down Mix.  Because I'm a bitch and don't give a crap about online courtesy, I'll give you a link.  urlLink There.  Ironically, that's posted on the webspace of an Energy Research Lab of the University of Mexico. Good times. Now go kill their bandwidth everyone.  Anyways, listening to it without Acid Rei and the wings and the popping heads and the souls and the christmas lights I realize it isn't  that  cool, but I still love it. One thing I didn't notice until now is the woman does have an accent, though it's not as offensive as when most Japanese women try to sing in English. And due to the scene it was written for, it's very long and gets quite repetitive, as it is a seven-minute song. The beginning is the best. Oh, and the woman can't really sing, but that's beside the point. I still love this song ^_^.  So because I'm a geek, I'm trying to decide whether the lyrics are describing Shinji or Rei. I used to say Shinji because of the "..now the gift is all mine", but then I now realize it's "...now the guilt is all mine," so that's more generic and can go both ways I think. Hmm.   EDIT: Okay, it's still obviously Shinji, I'm just crazy. There is no way you can argue around it I think. Oh well, I guess Shinji deserves a song. I mean, Rei has..oh look, Rei got no song! I hate you Anno! Hehe.
