Seems like you wash the same area for 10 minutes and you have to look around you to actually tell that your making a little progress.  Finished that up around noon and then the bug guy came to our house which i got lucky enough to escort around cause my mom didnt like him (who knows)  So after that I had some lunch and then went outside to do the lawn for the last time this month because i will be gone...and i cant say that i will miss it either. The rest of the afternoon was spent playing Medal of Honor (which a did beat and was very proud of myself for it lol)  Grilled some hamburgers for dinner which were really good and then Meeta came over.  I was supposed to go to Codys house but I cant complain about Meeta coming over instead...another great night spent with her =)  Gonna miss her a lot when im gone...  So this goes out to someone that really seems to be having a tough time with life right now....im really sorry that you feel that way and that you feel like you have no other options but i just wanted to reemphasize that i am here for you if you need somone to talk to...anything, you know that.  If no one you know can help you then get someone that is a profesional to help you...do something.  Your way too good of a person to even think about that....more people care than you will ever know....heres one....all you have to do is ask....  well i am more than exhausted and it has been a long, tough day for me...this mood that im in REALLY needs to go away and i think that a little sleep will do just the trick....im out...  "...working together in our common faith, we can not fail."
