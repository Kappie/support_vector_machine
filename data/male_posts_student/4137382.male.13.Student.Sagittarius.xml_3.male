"Because that is what kids do. And if we know anything, the main members of this blog are kids. Lay off them a little. They don't have enough intelligence to come up with good arguments for Nintendo. (I think that the might also be girls) But maybe not... Anyway, Goombas are boring, they are little triangles of brown poo. If Nintendo lives long enough to make another console hopefully they will focus on what gamers want. ie: games like Halo, Doom, KOTOR and so on and so forth. Not what kids want. ie: Cutesy games that have no violence or suggestive themes with little or no gameplay.  More than likely they will reply to this post with some incredibly stupid peice of crap. Like: At 4:07 PM, Specialist said...  "...you guys just don't know all about playing games... and yeah I'm talkiong to you DUke, GAYLO lover, and all the rest of the unhardcore dolts... you guys just aren't TRU gamers... and DOOM coming out in the 90's... it came out LAST WEEK!!!! OMFG I GOT YOU ALL ON A LOGICAL CONTRADICTION, AND YOU PROBABLY WONT ADMIT IT!!!..."  Doom 1 and Doom 2 did come out in the 90's. Obviously specialist is very special.   Also At 5:57 PM, Specialist said... "DOOM 3 is CLEARLY a ripoff of Metroid Prime! I don't care if there were other DOOM games, who cares?!! That's the most mainstream game out there!!! Mainstream games suk.."  and " is there a dark and light section of the world in DOOM 3? NO, LOL... totally boring. The only color in DOOM 3 is DARK! OMFG, can Id make any gamez where there is a different color other than DARK?!!"  First off, Dark is not a color. Dark blue is a color. Light Blue is a color. And Doom does have sections colored "light" That just shows that you have played it. Specialist , By saying that mainstream games suck you are just shooting yourself in the foot. Metroid is mainstream. Mario is mainstream. Ask any kid who Mario is and he will know. Ask any kid who John 117 is and he won't.  Doom 1 and 2 came out in the 90's so therfor MP rips off Doom. You retard. And Doom rips off Pong because both invovle moving and projectiles and have 'o' in their titles. Stupid.  So try to flame away little boys and girls. Nintendo is dieing and the DS is their last hope. "
