I feel nostalgic for things that haven't even happened yet... Instead of being excited for the future, I anticipate the sadness that will come after those things are gone... (:-\)   *Snaps out of it*   WOW, that was deep like a poem! :-D   Wasn't that great? More stuff like that AND MORE AND MORE later!
