Frisbee it passed the time anyway and after my German exam we played a bit of football for an hour (my shoulder is hurting even more now) ah well I think tomorrow I'll have a lie in and then see if I can be bothered to go up school even though I do not need to.   Thatâ€™s about it now so see ya  Dan :)   Current mood: Tired  Current music: Stereophonics - Handbags and gladrags
