That is about all that is going on.   I saw Van Helsing tonight, and it was alright. I didn't have any expectations or anything that it would be good, so mediocrity satisfied me. But 7 bucks for a movie ticket is just robbery, and I said as much to the ticket lady.  "If you don't like it, move to Russia."  I'm really tired now, but I'll write something interesting and engaging tomorrow night. I'll spend all day thinking about it.  Until then.
