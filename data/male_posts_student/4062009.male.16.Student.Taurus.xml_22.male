I didn't do much at all that is very interesting. And in Physics, I must say that I am completely brain dead. I don't know why, I just can't think in there at all. It's strange. But all my other classes are going by rather well.  Plus, 24 FPS Film Club starts tomorrow. Yeah! This means that I get to watch movies for free, stay away from the house some, and maybe help out in the club with it's plays and things. I was never really active in the club in past years, but I want to stop that and be active these last two years. I may also look into some art clubs and see when they are active and things. Anyway, thats that.  Well, i am going to jet. Talk to you all later! Cya!
