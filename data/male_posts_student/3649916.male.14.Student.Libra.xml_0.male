For nearly 3 months I had stayed inside playing UO and today yesterday and the day before I went to the river with my friends and then went to bed.  It is awesome all we do is light a fire, drink, talk, tan, and swim, i mean doesnt get better then that.  I am in such a happy mood right now.  One of my friends ran away from home and it is super funny, i mean he took all the clickers from his house lol.  Tomorrow me, and my friend are going to get super loaded and do dumb shit! it is gonna be fucking awesome.  Right now i am listening to some alexisonfire and loving it because they are like the best.  Well i dont have much else to say, but peace out and have a good summer.  I know i am so far!
