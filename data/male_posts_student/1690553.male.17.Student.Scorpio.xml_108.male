Creating this 'baby' made me busy for a few days a back and have turn down a chatting appointment. Sorry, my friend, I'll get the info you want as soon as possible. This baby is real smooth, with 512MB RAM and 80GB SATA HDD. A far cry from the PC I've used before, a 6-years-old Pentium II 300Mhz. Sound so geeky right? Heheh, I do love technology.  OK, have to continue installing device drivers and applications. See you all around later. :-D
