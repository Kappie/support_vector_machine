Muttiah Muralitharan - the diminutive, unorthodox off spinner, could lay claim to be one of those few players in world cricket, who always keeps the statisticians busy. Murali manages to give the red cherry such an enormous amount of tweak, that it's no surprise he has tumbled, crashed and banged into cricket's elite list within no time. Unless you are as gifted as a Tendulkar, Sidhu or a Ganguly, who tend to play spinners like they are literally having a ball out there (in quintessential Ravi Shastri lingo), I sometimes wonder how it is humanely possible to read and play a ball that turns square, within microseconds.  "Javelin thrower". Ironically, the only word that I have ever liked Mr. Bishen Singh Bedi say. Because otherwise, Mr. Bedi comes off as one of those really contemptible personalities in the media. His viewpoints are not only injudicious and completely thoughtless, he tends to show an absolute lack of respect for cricketers (ah yes, the famous anti-Ganguly xenophobia). Now, Bedi calling Murali a dacoit and a thief might seem on the harsher side, but javelin thrower, yes, I agree. Very much. Forget the doosras and teesras, even his "pehela" is  so  doubtful at times (*chuckle*). 44 five-for's and 13 ten-for's over a career spanning just 89 matches, beggars belief if you picture a "normal" bowler; but clearly, Murali is not!  A fact even more bamboozling than a Murali doosra is that of the ICC trying to  bend  the rules in order to save his career. Save Murali's career after he plays for a decade and bags 500 wickets!? Can anybody possibly shed some light on  that ? Letting bowlers bend their arms 5/10/15 degrees after studying all the bio-mechanics is utterly non-sensical. This is nothing short of a joke, and is making sheer mockery of a tremendous sport. So, I ask ICC. Will on-field umpires now carry devices like "bend-o-meters" or something to keep track of how much a bowler bends his arm/elbow? Chucking is mostly regarded as a very subjective and sensitive issue, but as Bobby Simpson says, its still very much blatant! And rightly so. Why have a career at all, if the player is not "physically" in the right shape to play the game? Why create exceptions for rules? Moreover, incessant chucking, as in Murali's case, after so-called experts have analysed and suggested improvements, definitely calls for a ban. Personally, the thing that gets most on my nerves is, even after the doosra has been banned, Murali doesn't hesitate to bowl that delivery, and match referres like Mike Procter continue to turn a blind eye towards the case. As I write this, I am reading the news that Procter has reported a Zimbabwe bowler from their second-string side for his action. This is nothing short of petrifying; not because a Zimbabwe bowler should not be called, but because Murali continues to get away with  his . C'mon, who needs Procter, bring on Darrell Hair!  Looking at the current trends in the ICC's approach to tackling the chucking problem and simultaneously "globalizing" the game, twenty years from now, I foresee professional cricket being played the "under-arm" style. Incidentally, the very way most of the sub-continent grows up playing. Perhaps, then, the only person that will have the last laugh is Trevor Chappell, heheheh.  Sorry Muttiah Muralitharan, your record rings a little too hollow.
