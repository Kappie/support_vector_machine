Prince said low-carb diets that advocate piling on the animal protein and fat are "increasing the risk of developing cancer, heart disease, stroke, type-2 diabetes and other chronic diseases." best  urlLink soup  in the world... i need to hit up these places in china.  if i'm going to be a pharmacist... i need to know how these drugs work... i have a legal obligation to be knowledgable and inform my clients/patients about drugs and stuff right?  this is why i'm afraid of the  urlLink south ... i was actually just talking to aaron about it last night.  how do you "forget" to take segregation laws off the books for a couple decades?  ok... that's all for now... gonna go catch spiderman 2 with jill later.  yay long weekend!
