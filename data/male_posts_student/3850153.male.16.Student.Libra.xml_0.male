If you spend a lot of time on that end of semester project, as Solomon, Ryan and I did, and aren't in the half that passes ready yourself for this speech: "WellI thought it was good, but [suck air through fake smile ]you're going to half todo it again." (I'm of course hypothesizing,I don't have her for TOK and have no real idea how many times she may suck air through her teeth). Thankfullymy second project is looking good and the class ends on Friday. I also got to watch on PBS (since the networks didn't think it was important enough) Barack Obama address the Democratic National Convention. He is my new hero. Look him up:  urlLink www.obamablog.com . TonightI watched my other hero the Rev. Al Sharpton go 14 minutes over his limit in an amazingspeech. I still can't understand why he lost (yesI can).
