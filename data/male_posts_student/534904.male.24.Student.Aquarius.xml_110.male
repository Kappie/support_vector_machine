I may have already stated this somewhere on here before, if not, then on  urlLink Orkut , but before the Merger between Flinders Street School of Music and the Elder Conservatorium, I was pumping out more music than I knew what to do with.  Since having to attend the university, and having to put up with the bullshit administration, I've barely put out enough work to cover my own arse, let alone fulfil the course requirements. Hell, I haven't written a single piece of music this whole year so far!   If there were no rewards to reap, No loving embrace to see me through, this tedious path I've chosen here, I certainly would have walked away by now. And I still may. -MJ Keenan   My problem, is that there are no obvious rewards to reap, and there is no loving embrace to see me through. I certainly haven't walked away, but with every passing day, I come closer to it. My recital is nearly a year overdue, and even after culling  nine months  of work - my entire symphony - from it, it would appear that it's still going to be too difficult to pull off anytime soon. I'm not getting enough work as a courier to justify quitting uni altogether, and I'm just too damned close to finishing anyway. It's just a pity that the university atmosphere has sucked me dry of all desire to achieve something. Almost everything about the place is so fucking oppressive, it scares me. It makes me want to scream.   There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away. Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting. I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing. Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication. -MJ Keenan   One problem is that there's  no  communication. Students don't know wtf is going on, and the administration don't care what the students think. The only people that  do  know that things should be better are chastised for mentioning it.  Suckin up all you can, suckin up all you can suck. Working up under my patience like a little tick, fat little parasite, suck me dry. My blood is bruised and borrowed. You thieving bastards, you have turned my blood cold and bitter, beat my compassion black and blue.  Hope this is what you wanted, hope this is what you had in mind. Cuz this is what you're getting. I hope you're choking; I hope you choke on this. -MJ Keenan  Thanks for helping me make a point, and to express what I'm feeling, Maynard. You rock.
