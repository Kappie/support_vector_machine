Only cause evryone else that was there already wrote about, and 2, cause i know u guys juss LOVVEE to know how i think :o))....  ok, enough of that. I'll try to keep it to the facts, and i'll clear up some false information that was said in other Entries.   ok. It's saturday.  What was so special? It's Me and Lilia's one month going out.  Good little accomplishment i might add. (sorry, but u HAVE to do something for your one month!)  Well, it was also Jones' and Caroline's one month too...and since Caroline wanted to eventually double date, might as well right? lol, well, ya, so saturday was the big day.  I woke up at around 11, 11:30, and started to get ready.  Went on the comp to play some music, and talked to jones. He too was going to get ready, and after some errands he had to run, he would pick me up.  I then proceed to look at my supply of Khakis pants...and holy shit...i have WAYYYYY to many...but ya, i go through, and immediatly discard the wrinkled ones.  Well, after the "filtering", i come down to the "Perfect Pair", but, i didn't really like the color.  So i go look in my dads closet, find nice white khakis, and try em on..there wrinkled as FUCK...i hate that about khakis, like, all folded and shit, the look absolutly fine and shit, but when u put them on, u see it's true colors...DAMN YOU WHITE KHAKIS!!! anyway, to top it off, NONE of those pants fit me 'perfect", so i had to wear the Calvin Klien belt i borrowed from my dad alittle tighter than usual, which i hate, cause it becomes annoying. Well, anyway, everyone knows black ALWAYS goes with khakis, so i was on a epic quest to find me a black shirt.  Couldn't find one. so i just went back into my dads closet and found one! problem is, it was a TAD bit tiny....roll the sleeves up?  o yea..   Anyway, some time passes, you know, last minute touches, the ol' shave, after shave, gel....cleaned the cat litter...u know.  lol, anyway, ya, i wait, and jones shows up.  I go up, and immediatly feel over dressed. He had khakis on too, but the ones with the side pockets and shit, and he had his Karate shirt on, with a black shirt over that.  i'm not saying he looked bad, i'm just comparing to show you WHY i would feel over dressed.  Anyway, we talk for alittle bit, and Finally get to our Lunch location, Casa de Nicola, in Croton.  There already there when we get there, and then they get out... WOW , the looked soooOoooo amazing.  Caroline had that skirt she was talking about on, and Lilia had that top she wouldn't let me see earlier on...and just whoa...caroline looked good, but WOW, lilia looked absolutly amazing...lol, i couldn't even compliment her as much as i wanted to! i was at a lost for words, i really was...she looked that damn good...but anyway, after we said hi, they informed us that the resturant doesn't open until like 2 (or maybe it was 3), which wasn't until another 2 hours pass by, so we immediatly begin to think of where to eat.  I thought of all the Fancy, fairly cheap resturants, and all of them seemed to be at the Palisades mall, so i suggested Romano's Macorroni (is that right?) Grill.  I've eaten there like 20 times before, so i know it's good, and there good with prices.  Well, i think this is how it went....we get to the mall, and are still deciding? i dunno, something like that, but....OO!! ok, nevermind, i suggested the palisades, and that we were gonna just decide when we get there.  THENNN we agreed on Romano's...there we go.  Anyway, we get there, and we all order our foods, chat, and just chill.  We ordered Fried CAlamari, and DAMN they where good.  Anyway, we had it planned that we were gonna go to the city, so after lunch, we head on over BACK to croton to catch the train.  We chill waiting for the train, and finally get on. Lilia and I sat opposite on jones and Caroline on the train, and we were all..."relaxing"...first of all cause we could, and second cause it was the local train....ya, long ride.  But anyway, we get to Grand Central, and it's still as beautiful as i remember it.  Jones mentions he loves it at christmas time, and i can't agree more.  I've been lucky enough to be in the city many times during the holiday season, and it dosn't get any more beatiful than that.  Anyway, we filled up our metro cards, and decided that the game plan was gonna be The Village, China Town, then Soho.  Well, me immidiatly leave grand central to go to Duane Reade...caroline wanted mints...well, whatever.  We get on the subway, and get to Christopher Street, in the Village.  We start walking around, and eventually see that were we gonna cross into queens....ya, to far..so we go back.  Then i go to the bathroom...AGAIN...you see, through this entire magic carpet ride, i have to go to the bathroom, it sucks SOOO much...i don't even know why, prolly the calamari or something...w/e it was, it sucls MAJOR ass...but anyway...we then continue to be in the Village. At one point, we head over to Barnes and Noble cause jones and Caroline read books apprently.  anyway,  ya, i looked around, and immediatly went to the New Age section, my favorite section.  Didn't find anything worth reading though.  And to clear up what caroline, AND jones both typed out, we weren't making out in the New Age Section, honestly.  Everyone so often during the walk, we'd give each other little kisses, and they just so happen to walk in mid-kiss...so there you go. anyway, after like, an hour there, we head out.  I got sushi in Lilia's head, so we then decide to go have sushi for dinner.  I've had CAlifornia rolls, so atleast i had some idea, but caroline and Jones both didn't want any.  But i must say, Lilia definitely go me into eating sushi...(THANX!!) anyway, jones had a big ass plate of pork fried rice or something, and caroline had Won ton Soup.  Well ya, after some argueing, the ladies finally wont he war against who was gonna pay...we leave, and then try to find a subway that we could take to Chinatown...that didn't end up happening, and we ended up walking from the VIllage, all the way to midtown...some might think that would suck...i acutally found it VERRRYYY awsome, and i think we should do it again...it's absolutly amazing to walk around manhatten at night, but to be with freinds, and g/f, just sharing it is even better.  After a LONGGG night, we finally take the 12:00 train out of there. On the way back, this guy that sounded drunk talked to kids about smoking, and even gave them the "talk"....very amusing...ones again me and Lilia "Relaxed" and from what i saw, jones and Caroline were reading the books they bought at barnes and noble...some humor books...something about sex, and another one about ninja's...  We get back, all nice and tired from our journey, and jones goes to drop of Lilia first, at which he then says we can use his backseat...so, ofcourse, i did. (!)....lol, anyway, after that rather long, yet appreciated goodbye, we turned around to go drop of Caroline.  After the said there goodbye, jones drops me off...i was DAMN giddy, but i can't tell you why.  Anyway, i get back home, and thats all i remeber doing..i might have gone online,but i doubt it... o wait, no, i talked to my dad, explained why iwas late,and thats about it.   Well, might as well go into sunday right??  Sunday was alright. i don't remeber doing anythign in the morning...i might have been with lilia.  O wait, no i wasn't.  wait...maybe...anyway, it prolly dosn't matter...i get to antioch, and it was raining, and i see carolines car, but no caroline, so i thought they were up at the church, but i decided to just chill in my car before driving up. wait..shit, that was another sunday! I just remembered...we all chilled that day!! OKOKOKOK  monday monday.....hmmmmm...... I'm pretty sure we hung out AGAIN, but i'm not sure. I think we did..and if we did, it was prolly just regular old chilling...WAIT...monday i think we played poker...yeahhhhh, thats it! that was awsome, one some cash, it was all good...lilia kicked ASS though which makes her that much more awsome.    Tuesday: we might have played poker that night, not sure. WAIT. NO. Me lilia, czank, benny, and mike chilled at Vet's for awhile...ya, thats it.  THen we went to 711 for a bit. Nothing to bad,  but it was fun none the less.  yesterday we chilled again. Picked up the girls, and went to shoprite to meet up with caroline.  Mike and Benny, and KC were at vet's waiting for us.  Well, we finally get there, chill, and wait for czank to get there. Czank gets there, but then we wait for andy.  This is somewhat torture cause alot of people were hungry, and pizza was on there minds.  well, andy makes it, and we head out.  We get to dominoes, and eat, and then everyone wants to go to starbucks, so we do. we chill there some more, i guess thats it. more happned, but i don't htink i should mention it here :o)....no, not like that..after that, we decide we gotta go somewhere else, so we head to senaqua.  After chilling for like 40 minutes, we decided to leave, which is when caroline suggests her house. (i think thats how it went).  Half way there, my car brakes down in the middle of the road..nothign bad happned though, just wanted to mention it.  We get to carolines house, and we chill in the back..when her mom said we had to go, me and lilia go in the back seat to say goodbye...but by that time, i'm tired, and kinda mad, so it wasn;t as passionate as i would have liked it to be.  Anyway, half way into that, the rest of the gang comes up.  ya...pretty much killed whatever i had...which wasn't ot anyway...i was kidna agry, but just pissed about alot of stuff at the same time, so if any of u were wondering why i looked mad..i was, just not cause of THAT...entirely...  Today: I was suppose to be with lilia today until 5:30, but things came up.  See, yesterday, she was able to leave earlier than expected cause she didn't have to go to her lawyer.  Well, apparently, she forgot that TODAY she has to go...and on top of that, it's her Step-dad's birthday, so they gotta go out...ya.  No idea when she's getting back, but it's ok i guess. After dropping my lil bro, Andy Im's me needing a ride for work, i couldn't, cause my car was beng a dick, and was fucked up like the day before, so i couldn't...sorry man. Rob called for a ride to, but that's on satudary, i might, i might not be able to, let's see how things work out.  Tommarrow: Friday.  A bunch of us are going back to the beach.  Always good times there.  Problem is, we also got invited to Michelle's graduation party, that being held at Hernendez', so i have no idea what were gonna do.  Well, beucase we'd be leaving early anyway, we'll prolly gonna go.  Thats about all i know so far about tomarrow...   so ya, there u have it, from Saturday to now....I just have to mention that Lilia's going this sunday, it is sucks soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much, it's unbelievable.  She's pretty much gone for the entire month of august, which sucks, cause summer school ends in like 2 weeks..god i'm gonna miss her.  I made her a CD and what not, of songs that remind me of her, or show how much i'm gonna miss her...things of that nature...but shit. I was talking to caroline about this.  like right now, i'm not to sad, but 2 days from now i'm gonna be SHIT....just watch me guys....When we hang out, i'm gonna be quite, i'm gonan be alot more reserved....less jokes and shit...i already no...but this is just a warning,...don't ask whats wrong, cause your gonna know anyway..It's kinda wierd looking back on the month....acutally, this whole summer really.  i can honestly say this has been the very best summer i've had in my entire life. florida/bahamas, Freinds, famly...g/f...god, this is really gonna suck.  Hopefully i'll get to see her during the time she's away. She's  just...to awsome, really, i can't even put it into words..like, i remmebr chilling with the guys, discussing the "perfect" chick for us..like, lilia is the girl i described, she's everything i've ever wanted in a g/f. Maybe thats why i'm gonna miss her so much. What's even better is she's MADDDDD cool with my freinds....a girl that fits into our group...NO WAY...and not only that, the rest of her freinds too!! *GASP*...lol, ya...i'm sorry, but i feel real lucky, and i've told her this...  anyway, thats it..i had to mention that she was leaving, or else it would get to me....if you've just read this whole thing through, congrats...now it's your turn to write an entry...  Counting down to 1 never sucked so much.. steve..
