Whenever I try to work on anything proper I have to stop because I’m violently coughing. Bitching.  So rather than risk my own health, I’ll just post some crap I wrote for tga, some website I decided to re-join simply because I’m not famous there… Yet xD ----- Name: Decanus Tafford Age: Twenty   Race: Human Sex: Male Kingdom: Libaterra Class: Swashbuckler Weapons: A cutlass called Poonany, and a knife called Mang. They be sharp weapons, ai. Innate magic ability: Decanus has the shrewdly devious ability to mimic the voice of anybody he has heard talking. Some people say it isn’t magic, but simply a bloody ace connection between his ear and vocal chords. But hey, it’s a kind of magic, and you should all listen to Queen if you don’t agree. Physical description: Decanus is the bomb with the woman, and it isn’t just because he’s well endowed in a certain area down under, but because he looks like a man. A real man, not some metrosexual bastard at that. From the sophisticated, yet masculine, eye patch over his left eye, to the black soul patch under his lip. His eyes are a riveting brown, and with them he unclothes women without their consent. Arrrrrrr  Decanus is the stylish pirate you only wish you could be. His choice of a dashing pirate hat, an unfastened cotton shirt with bloody long sleeves, and black cotton pants with those ingenious laces up the groin area all indicate he is trendy. The shirt is rarely buttoned up, thus revealing the masculine, meaning hairy and muscular, body of Decanus. He also has leather boots that could easily pulverise your ‘valuables’ into useless muscle. So watch what you say. Character description: Decanus is a player, and like Hugh Heffner he is idolised for following the dream. He is also a drunkard, a presumptuous cunt, and an all-around loveable guy. He isn’t “take-home-to-your-parents” presentable but hey, you can’t have everything, whelp. He also has a natural, groovy pirate accent. So he says “Ai” a lot. Background info: Decanus was born to a working girl, a very attractive whore. Who his father was exactly, the mother could not remember. She had screwed way too many people, and had continued well into her eight months of pregnancy. Which just goes to show, people have strange fetishes.  As soon as Decanus turned six, he became a stowaway on a ship called “The Bloody Heathen”. The captain of the ship was, unfortunately, a paedophile. So when Decanus was found, he was immediately brought into the captain’s room. Luckily, before anything could happen to our young hero, a saucy vixen appeared out of nowhere (deus ex machine) and saved him by cutting off the captain’s wang, who died a second later because he had been thinking with his dick at the time, and we all know that by chopping off our thinking mechanism we cease to exist. Then she stripped, made the young Decanus get a hard on, and they made passionate love beside the corpse of ol’paedophile.  Only after she turned into water did Decanus realise he had been seduced by a water maiden. Like it really mattered! HE GOT LAID AT SIX! Anyways, it was only a day later did he notice that he seemed to sparkle with magical energy, when a bloke came to check upon the old captain. Though he had never held a sword before in his life, he took up the cap’n’s cutlass and turned the dude into shish kebab.  Yes, Decanus Tafford’s life has been truly inspiring. To make a long story short, for the next fourteen years of his life, Tafford spent his time plundering and shagging and drinking, drinking and shagging and plundering, and did this all at sea. So when he finally crashed into land because of drunk driving and was forced to get off the ship he so loved, he realised something. There isn’t more to life than drinking or shagging or plundering. So now he does these things in local pubs. He lives in Trinity Gask a happy man, with hardly a worry as to the whole rebel vs other foreign bastards conflict. Yet. ----- Yes, I got lazy near the end xD Now, his theme song is played to the tune of the theme song from Shaft, but with some changes… ----- Decanus Who's the white pirate dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks? (Decanus!) You're damn right Who is the man that would risk his neck for his brother man? (Decanus!) Can ya dig it? Who's the cat that won't cop out when there's danger all about (Decanus!) Right on You see this cat Decanus is a bad mother-- (Shut your mouth) But I'm talkin' about Decanus (Then we can dig it) He's a complicated man but no one understands him but his women (Decanus Tafford) ----- Do you dig it? Of course you do.     Well, i've been collecting some records of my ownage of others on msn, and all will be revealed soon... As soon as I collect two more, that is.
