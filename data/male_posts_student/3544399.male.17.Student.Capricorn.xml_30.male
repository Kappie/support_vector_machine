Others are envious of your talent for skating through life doing only half as much real, actual work as everyone else.  You're an expert at talking teachers or bosses out of reprimanding you for your apparent lack of effort.  On the upside, you won't have to worry about things like repetitive stress disorder or high blood pressure.  Your life expectancy is probably pretty high due to this, not that you'll actually accomplish anything, you damn leech.           urlLink Be cool! Take the What Do You Want Out Of Life?
