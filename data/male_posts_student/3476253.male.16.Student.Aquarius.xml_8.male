Anyways, I just woke up less than an hour ago, so nothing has happened yet today.  About yesterday, I went running again, and found it that it wasn't as hard as a I thought it was going to be.  I run a lot better if I try not to think too much, and just focus on what's ahead of me.  Something interesting happened before my run yesterday.  I was walking a game up to the video store to return it, and I met a very odd person.  As I put the game in the return box, a cross dresser walked by me!  He had a pink stuffed sports bra, lots of nasty make up (it didn't cover up the facial hair :-/ ), and short shorts.  The worst part was the huge beer belly hanging out from the sports bra...ughhh.  Early yesterday, a girl IMed me, and it took me a while to guess who it was.  It was the girl from my below post, the one I liked way back when.  We just talked about random stuff, nothing too serious (mainly cross country and video games), but it was nice.  She has a job (something I should get around to getting...) at her favorite fast food place (she was surprised I remembered it was her favorite), so things are going good for her.  Ah well, that's all that has happened lately :)
