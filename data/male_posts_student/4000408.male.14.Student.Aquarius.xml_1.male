Then somemore i still go for volleyball and kena scoulded by the crazy sq coach cuz i was too tired and dreamy, all cuz of *someppl* then i hafta to for that crap!When i reached home it got worse...THe mucus flowed out like a waterfall, made me wonder if i was made of mucus. Heart filled with agony, mind is a whirl, vindictiveness builds up and melancholy raises...
