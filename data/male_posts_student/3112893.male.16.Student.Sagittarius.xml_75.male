I didn't post it in a public domain, but I still wrote it and it was on the net... just really well hidden. Anyway, I was reading them and I thought that it would be cool to post them in chronological order. There are a total of 15 posts, so I think what I'll do is post my first old post first and two a day after that for the following week.  When I read them, it was a very interesting experience. It was like I was brought back to the time when I was writing it. It seems that I remember it so vividly that when I reread them, I had all the feelings that I had  while  writing it. It was like I was kinda taken back in time in my head. I don't know if that's entirely common, but it was the strangest sensation I've ever had.  Ah yes, that reminds me, when I was going through my old files, I also stumbled upon a picture of last year's* halloween costume. I made it out of cardboard, black (main body) and silver (letters) spray paint, aluminum foil (pins), theater tape, and a 20,000 dollar laser-cutter (used to cut out the letters, pins, the pin 1 indicator (inset circle) in the top left corner and the semi-circle thing cut into the top of the chip to help further show which is pin 1) at my dad's work. Total cost of materials sans laser-cutter: ~30 bucks. I still have it. It's sitting in one of my closets in LA. The picture of me isn't very good, but it's the best one that I have (there were three taken, of which this is the best). I wore it out of the airport when I landed in LA with it and I got cheers and laughs. People wanted to take pictures with me wearing it. It was awesome. Anyway, the picture:   urlLink     Click to Enlarge   And so, in conclusion, my first post will be put up here tomorrow and then we shall just go from there.  That is all. -- Feanor  * 2003
