Getting some funding for next year would be really nice.   I really need to go grocery shopping in the next few days... I need milk, juice, soda, coffee, etc.  Oh I finished  Brotherhood of the Wold ... the end was a bit more exciting. I have to wonder if the beast is supposed to be a metaphor for political events going on in pre-revolution France.  **
