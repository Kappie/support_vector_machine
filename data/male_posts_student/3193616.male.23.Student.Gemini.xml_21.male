I am yet to get into the details and by the caution the market has shown by diving down on hearing about the tax proposal, I think this budget might have something peculiar. The Education cess is a good idea, but as is always said, the problem is not the lack of money but the efficient use of it. So, if Mr.Chidambaram can find some ways to use it efficiently, that would spell success to India
