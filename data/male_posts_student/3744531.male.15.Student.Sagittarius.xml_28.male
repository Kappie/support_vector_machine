I'm not of that kind of people who cries for this, but let me tell you that it was sad to see all my classmates crying...  But all our teachers gave us a few words of hope, joy, and why not, of reality...  Like the math theacher who said all that sad thing just for make us cry and he was very happy to see some of us crying...he´s not bad, but that´s the way he is...  The spanish teacher said two or three things to each one of us... that´s something nice if she say some nice things, but it was the oposite thing, she just focus on tell us our bad things....  From that moment it all was....Partyyyy!!!!!....whoa....well thats what we think until the chemistry teacher arrives...she order that we have to turn off the music...bahh...but we continue...  Then the last moment came....with just 10 minutes to say goodbye to everyone that I see, it was all hughs, kisses and tears....  My friend alberto and me were the last who put a step outside of the college...  Now it´s a new beginig...but I can't negate that I´m gonna miss this moments...
