Life, death, what to do tommorow, an hour from now, right now. If anyone has got anything on those big questions, drop me a line. As for now, I have decided to write this blogg. I got to talk to Mike again today, miss the guy lots. It also makes me miss David, who seems to have been drifting away. The ol' click parts ways for now, but shall be reunited when Mike comes home on leave. Don't wait up for me come the 28th.  Lonelyness creeps in on me, I can only hope to spend some time with my friends soon. There seems to be nothing but work and solitude lately. There is change on the horizon though, soon summer shall end. Painful to say, but it shall and I shall be attending University. I can only hope it is a equal or better experience than highschool was. New friends, teachers, courses... and of course partying! Once I turn 18 anyways.  Changes are on the horizon, good or bad, happy or sad. All matters not as long as I make them and feel no regret.
