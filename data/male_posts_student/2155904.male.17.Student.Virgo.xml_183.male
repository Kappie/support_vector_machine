Absolutely nothing fun happened at school today.  It was all just fine.  Nothing terrible, nothing spectacular.  Just plain old -_- .  That sorta worked for what Tyke was trying to do.  It will stay.  After school Tyke came home and talked with his mom about graduation and such and showed her the graduation announcements that he picked up today.  It's cool to have those cuz it means he's graduating.  And graduating is cool.  Other than that Tyke really didn't do anything until about 5:45 when he got dressed (wore the pink shirt) and went to Farget and Ted Meyer's for some looking at stuff.  He got his mom the Calendar Girls DVD cuz he knew she wanted that.  Not so much a movie Tyke has a vested interest in seeing though.  But whatev, it isn't for him anyway.  The weirdest part about Tyke's shopping was when he was at Ted Meyer's.  He went up to the checkout stand and put his little toy on the thingy and the girl (probably about the same age as Tyke) right off the bat looked at his eyes for a little and then said that she liked his shirt (well, it is pink...duh).  Tyke responded with a reserved chuckle and expressed his gratitude.  Then she did her whole scanning and stuff and Tyke paid and then when he was walking away he sorta turned back a little and she was checking out Tyke.  Now, Tyke may not get checked out ever but he can still tell when someone is checking someone else out.  But yeah, even though the girl wasn't even that cute it was still flattering for Tyke.  Tyke was definitely looking hawt in his pink shirt and sorta tight jeans.  Ouch!  Well Tyke went back home for a few minutes before heading off to Dotti's.  There he met up with Piggy J, MormoMan, Dotti, and Dotti's friend Carrotopolous (it is super hard to think of a good name for her but for now Carrotopolous will do).  Purdy, Tina, Mandy, and Tig came a little bit after them and then they all got in the 2 cars.  Tig drove Purdy, Tyke, Tina, and Mandy in order from left to right, front to back.  They all went to Beppo's for dinner and took many a picture.  The dinner was great and there were these weird chicks at the table across from them that were talking about a "sex toy party" and other crazy random shit that was interesting, but totally unsuspecting.  They seemed drunk but they weren't.  And none of them were hot either which is too bad cuz at one point they almost started making out.  But that was hardly the highlight of dinner.  Tyke sat next to Carrotopolous and Tina and thoroughly enjoyed himself.  After the nice, long dinner the gang went to this park in Seattle that has a wonderful view of Seattle and surroundings.  They took some pictures and made fools of themselves and then got back in the car again.  The drive home was filled with lots of screaming, singing, dancing, flashing, and craziness.  And of course, was a blast.  Upon re-entrance into Issaquah the cars split up and met back at the bonfire pit by Tina's house where they set up a bonfire.  Tyke helped Tina get the log for the fire and talked to her parents a little before leaving.  Then they got it all set up and set the place ablaze.  Karla, C-Biscuit, Dudely Doo, etc. all came down after the flame had risen.  Stories were shared, marshmallows were devoured, apple-cinnamon smoke filled the air.  It was a night to be cherished and a memory to last a lifetime.  Heh, that was fun to write.  But really it was great to spend some quality time for Dotti's birthday dinner and Tyke was exceptionally happy to be involved.  And Saturday's only just beginning.
