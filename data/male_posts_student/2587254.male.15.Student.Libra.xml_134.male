Aww crap I can't upload them at the moment since MyImgs.com apparently only lets you have a 5 day trial with a free account...so yeah I can't post up my gruesome pics of the dissection. But yeah final day of dissection was still amusing, despite the smell of preservatives and the decomposing of the pig. But ignoring that, the cutting up of the pig and exploring the insides of it was still as amusing as before =P. The rest of my day was also as usual as the other days, with another sub teacher since Whart is gone...and we'll ahve a different one next Tuesday. Yeah I know so many of them...  So this morning I woke up at usual time, got the usual things done like usual, and then headed out the door. Happy Calgary won last night...hope they face off with Tampa, since I really hate Philly. So going to school, I guess I was in a good mood...and like usual the music sucked. Got to school, and since I left late I headed to music class pretty quickly. Oh yeah and the T-Wolves won ^_^.  Music class today....we had Music Council elections! The videos like usual were really funny, and that pretty much took up the whole class. Whew avoided chromatic scales test ^_^. So anyways the people I voted for 2004-2005 were:  Secretary - Lindsay Brown $$$ people - Niki n' Caitlin VP - Helen Kneale the Co-P's - Christian and Geoffrey  Those are all the positions....right? Anyways those are the people I remember voting for. So after the elections, headed to class for last 5 minutes, and then 2nd period.  Science: two words. ASSIGNMENT WORK. Or Worked on Assignment, but that's three words. Anyways that's all we did for class, and then handed 'em in.  Lunch today went out with Nate, Fulmer, Duong, Chris and Pourier. Ended up going to Mr. Sub, which actually isn't too bad. In fact if I don't play ball tomorrow, I may head there for a lunch ^_^. It's actually better than Subway in a way I think. So ate there, walked back, and played the 30 seconds of ball I was there for and then the bell rang.  Bio class! Yay! Finished dissection! Today we had to look at the reproductive system and excratory system mostly. Also, we looked at the trachea, kidneys, and various other parts also. Oh yeah and today's gruesome part:  Breaking his jaw open.  That was probably the more interesting part of dissecting today. It wasn't as hard as cracking the ribs, but much more sound effects. I mean, just imagine someone shoving something to pry open your jaw, then two strong forces pulling them apart so wide, that you hear the cracking and dislocating of your lower jaw and the joint part. After that though it was all pretty easy cruising. I decided to take a few pics with my d-cam....ugh was so friggin' annoying since my batteries were on low so I had to be very conservative with what pics to take lol. Oh well in the end I got 5 pics....hopefully I can upload em one of these days... so finished that up, and then headed to english class.  English we got some year end assignment where we have to act out someone from a book we studied in the year, and also we finished watching Fried Green Tomatoes....well almost. 7 minutes or so left.  So headed home then...and while cutting through the park today...*crack.* My bag's strap broke AGAIN. Ugh this is the 2nd time...except this time the strap was intact, and the joining thingy broke. UGH.....this is why you:   NEVER BUY CHEAP DUFFEL BAGS FROM SOME BAG STORE IN THE EATONS CENTRE WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR CLOSING DAY SALE AND SELL YOU A BAG FOR 20 BUCKS!   Ugh it breaks in a matter of 2 months anyways....so I'm still stuck w/ same old same old. Also this shows that my average bag weight for school is over 20 pounds. Maybe the government should begin to give us less homework =P. Anyways when going to see Shrek 2 tomorrow I also gotta pick up a new bag >_  Got home....played some SC, balled, ate, slept....drank the remaining wine I opened the other day. Yeah....sparkling wine is good ^_^. And no I'm not a boozer, I just happen to like drinking wine after school....average amounts. Anyways, around 7 or so called up marcello to head to UCC for a bit.  Worked out and balled. My arms are slowly going back into ship shape as I could actually manage to bench 115 easily today.  Biceps are still kinda crummy, but abs and other stuff is goin' back to normal. Never will I go on that 4 month drought that put my muscles back into the stone age. So yeah gotta keep myself in shape now...since summer's coming too I have more time =). Also we balled a bit in the end....didn't do much since the courts actually had people today...and also Marcello and I just worked out so our shots were WAY off.  Got a lift back from him...and here I am now posting my blog. Think I'm gonna go eat now after chattin' w/ Niki and some other people on MSN.  Cya.
