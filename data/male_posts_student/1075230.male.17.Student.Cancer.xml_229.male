The car started with BOOM *smoke smoke smoke* chuga chuga *smoke smoke smoke* before continuing on its more than mildly dangerous trip to the schools of my sisters and I.  Half-way there, about McCowan and Shepherd, the car runs out of gas.   Us.  =.-   My dad force starts the engine and luckily enough there was a gas station 50 m away.  Thank the Lord.  My father then makes a left to get inside the gas station, but again the car dies... lying accross the oncoming traffic.  My sisters and I have to rush out of the car.  My sisters lightening the load, and I trying to push the car, unsuccesfully.  Thank God again for when the car started up and made its way into the station.  The car then choked and popped it's way to school.  More than once the thought that this car would blow up.  Now that I think of it, it reminds me of Archie's old Jallopy... the really crappy one that always choked and popped and smoked... like our car.  So anyway... This afternoon my dad picks me up.  Choke boom pop.  Instead of going home, we head towards a friend of the family's house for some business.  The car stalls.  As we're about the cross the bus intersection of Warden and Ellesmere the car overheats and stops.  My dad couldn't start it again because the engine was over heated.   The car behind us.  -.=    I  have to push the car accross the  inhospitable  intersection to the other side.  We just wait there for a bit for the engine to cool off.  But my dad realises that the police might arrive soon... so again, it's pushing time.  This time my sister and my father help in the pushing, since it was an uphill push, they were a great help.  Still, when I got into the car I was practically hyperventilating.  We had to push it down the street, about 100 meters, into a side street.  From there my dad walked my sisters to the house we were originally intending to go to while I slept.  I just found out my fly is open...  ON WITH THE STORY.  From this point, the engine has cooled off but the battery has died.  Like yesterday.  I'm there sleeping in the cold while my father tries anyone he can think of to come and help us.  Only when the battery of his cell phone starts to die does he listen to my suggestion of calling Renae, who lived just down the street.  This was just about an hour later.  =.=  Rei-chan comes with cookies.  ^^ slightly burnt, but still Rei-chan and her father were life savers.  My mom's timing was impeccable.  She arrived right after we lost a need for her.  Since Rei-chan's father's car was there we already had our 'boost source.'  We finally get out of there at six.  An hour and a half after we first died.  As we get home and pull into our street, our car starts dying again, but with the Lord's help it powered on and was able to go up the driveway.  Half-way up, the engine stopped.  -.-  But with the inertia we were able to make it  exactly , and let me stress exactly, where the car is supposed to be parked, at the top of the driveway.  Thank you Rei-chan for saving us, and for the slightly burnt cookies.  ^^ Thank you Lord for protecting us, even if it may seem like you were only putting us through pain, I know there were many examples of your helping hand.  Hopefully the rest of the night will go smoothly now... -_- Somehow I doubt it.  -ArV
