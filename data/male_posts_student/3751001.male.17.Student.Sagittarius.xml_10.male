As i'm bored i'd thought i'd write some random crap.  I can't wait until the big day when my wonderful family bugger off on holiday for a couple of days leaving me in command :D. So far i've got a gaming party planned, so far i've got Jonny, Sarah, Chris, Chaz and Vix coming along with a couple of game machines all wired into two TVs.  That should be occurring next monday or tuesday, before that on sunday though i'm off to the city centre, i'm trying to find a pirate flag and some form of t-shirt, also it will give me the opportunity to see some of my freinds again :D.  As for the site well it's ok, so far its generated about Â£5:00 in revenue from advertisements and other sources, i really need to actually put some content on the site though, the forum is the only completed part of the site.  I'm gonna get the "Bon Jovi saga" completed soon, its been in planning for weeks, i'm also awaiting a few comic strips of people and i would greatly appreciate any other work from anyone.  Currently listening to :: Iron maiden - Bring your daughter to the slaughter Currently making :: Random shite with photoshop and paint Favourite thing at the moment :: My freinds!!!  ~atrocity
