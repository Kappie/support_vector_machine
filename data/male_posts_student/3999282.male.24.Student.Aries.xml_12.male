Trying to fix that using Partition Magic 8.0, I screwed up my partition so that I couldn't turn on my laptop properly. Luckily I exchanged that crppy writer to the best one, HP DVD movie writer, so that I can finally make my recovery dics with DVD ^_^  Stephen went to see a dentist today and the tentist told him to remove two wisdoms next Tuesday. What a progress!! I tried my best to convince my bro to see a dentist and it worked^^
