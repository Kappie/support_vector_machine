The purposes are prayer, ministry, and discussion of topics that are important to you and honoring to God. If you have a prayer request, post it. If you have questions on how to witness, post it. If you have a message laid on your heart, post it. If you're in a situation where you don't know what to do and want advice, post. I suppose I'll start.  I'd appreciate everyone praying for me. Just that I would always keep God as the focal point in my life. That I would strive to become who He wants me to be. And that I would be wise in every decision I make. That's about it on my end. Hope to see you guys post.
