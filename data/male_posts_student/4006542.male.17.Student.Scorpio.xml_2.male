I go to Waihi college and its a decent school with alot of fucking weirdos and mentaly divergent people who think they know every thing and are loved by every one.  this town called Waihi is a hole its a small town thats soully dependant on a mine thats closing in about 10 years.  this place is a    "HOLE"   evry one leaves as soon as they can and if they dont they end up staying for ever.  Ilive with my mates in this renivated garage thast got its own bathroom, toilet facilitys and the works.  I've got a 20 year old girl friend who's the shit and oh so beautiful.  I've got heaps of mates,of who im not going to name in this except one who has his own blog here, his names Mattew will's or Murk.  its friday im board i cant wait to get home to get   absolutley Motherd   and play a little  X box  then go out or some thing maybe get some subway or KFC      if you read this i hope you got some injoyment from reading about some one elses life and what they get up to.    If you read this I ask you "Why?" you should be out side or in town, at a mates or fucking out clubing not sitting in some pour conditioned chair at home with most the curtains closed reading about other peoples lives to make your self feel alive.              F I N      (Sorry about the spelling)
