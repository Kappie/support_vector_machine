First, I come to school and my History teacher tells me my grade has greatly dropped because of my HW even though I still have a "B" in her class. Then, the rest of the day went great up to about 8th hour. That class is the most boring class ever. Then 9th period in biology it just got worse. My lab partner is a complete moron and a jackass. Then, during the lab I have no clue what the hell to do because my stupid teacher didn't give us any instructions. Then after school it got the worst. First, my parents complain about my "low" grades which are "B's." Then I started to talk to the person whom I like because I figure that would brighten up my day, but no, she basically completely ignored me. So, I decided to take a bike ride to clear my mind. Man, that was a bad decision. First, it starts raining hard when I am about .5 mile away from my house then on the way back I got hit by a freakin car. The driver was a complete moron. He hit me on the side of the street when I was right in front of him. I mean, what a complete jackass! So, today sucks, and my life sucks. Hopefully it will get better as time goes on.  later, bradleyJ
