It fits weird. It's long and has narrow shoulders. I guess it's 'cause lots of tall skinny vegans buy their stuff?  The rain has really drained me of energy and thus my productivity. I need to pick up some cream and spinach today for the dinner tonight.   Looks like I won't be living with Kazu next year... to stay with Hayes or not?  ***
