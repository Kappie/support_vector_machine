We pretty much drove around looking for something to do in LA, but alas there was no parking to be found for the longest time. However, then all of a sudden we found parking literally infront of the BJs in Westwood. Shocking!   It was cool. I now add Diana and Nikki to the assortment of boardies that I've met so far. Suzy, Ashok, Toni-Lynne, Diana T., Cissa, and Mike. A total of 8! All of course are cool people.  Now playing:   urlLink Bad Religion   - Live Again (The Fall of Man)  I only got 3 hrs of sleep last night as I didn't get home and into bed until about 2 AM, and I had to be at 5 ish for work at 7 AM.   So some people asked why people don't like that co-worker I mentioned in an earlier post. Well this morning, I was running a few minutes behind schedule and I saw a parking spot infront of the coffee shop. However, I couldn't park in it, because the girl parked all funky and I couldn't get into the spot. I had to go park a bit further away from the store.  Now playing:  NOFX  - Franco Un-American  I'm not so petty that I'd not like her because of a parking incident. Lots of people have talked about how her work rate isn't very good, hogs certain jobs and how she orders people around. I gave her the benefit of the doubt, because people make mistakes and she might have a hard time adjusting to working there.  However, she really is somewhat bossy. She asks people to do stuff, but isn't always ready to help other people out. Another co-worker higher up in the ranks told me, that if she  tells  you to do anything, you don't have to do it. It doesn't help that she asks for lots of days off, and doesn't seem to make an effort of trying to get to know people.   Now playing:   urlLink Pulley   - Insects Destroy  I'm hungry. I haven't had lunch yet. I don't know if I want to sleep first or eat first.  **
