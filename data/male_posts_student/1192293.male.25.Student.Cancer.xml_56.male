I was raised Catholic.  I grew up in a Roman Catholic Community, went to a Roman Catholic elementary school.  I was an altar boy, and I was married in the Roman Catholic Church.  I have never agreed with the church on many important points, such as the issues of priests marrying, female priests, their stance on homosexuality and homosexual marriage, the practice of reconciliation, but I was inspired by the ideals of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to stay within the church and try to change it from within.  Even through the altar boy sexual abuse scandal, I stuck with it, hoping that it could lead to a more open dialogue within the Catholic community about updating the practices of old to a more transparent, democratic future.  This, sadly, has failed to happen.  In my opinion, the Church has finally revealed itself for the moribund, worthlessly tradition-bound organization it is.  It has become a collection of pathetic prejudiced good old boys who value tradition more than truth.  So, barring future changes, I am no longer associating myself with the Roman Catholic Church.  So, you can have the decoder ring back, along with the tired homophobic rhetoric, bullshit black and white views on sexism and abortion, the hats, the pageantry and pomp; I won't be needing them any more.   urlLink Related Story
