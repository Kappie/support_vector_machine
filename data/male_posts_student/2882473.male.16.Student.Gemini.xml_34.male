Although, it probably has helped a bit; I now know the difference between an alkane and an alkene. Yep, it's that fun. I kind of gave up when I got to the section on calculations and realised I didn't know how to do even the simple calculations, but meh. I'm sure I'll get the hang of it at some point - probably several months after the exams. I may do a bit of business revision, because I reallly don't know much about that. IT'S ALL SO CONFUSING!!! Or boring. Or both. And the only reason I'm writing this is because I don't want to do any more revision.   Well, last night I made several attempts to improve the features of this blog, all ended in utter failure. I tried rainbow text, wavy text, drop-down-from-top text, fly-from-side text and many others. None worked, so I just left it how it was before I truly mucked the whole thing up.   I watched 'Good Will Hunting' last night. It was ok, about what I expected. There isn't really a lot to say about it; some kid descovers he's a maths genius but doesn't want to use his gift. Anyway, haven't got anything to say, so I'm off. ta ta.   Playing:   I don't play games  Listening To:  Burly Brawl Music  Watching:   Nought.  Annoyed With:   GCSEs  Confused About:  Chemistry calculations   Mood:  As always.
