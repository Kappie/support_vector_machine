I didn't even get to run because my relay team was too late and we missed our event so I basically woke up early in the morning to go in the freezing cold for 4 hours FOR NOTHING! The night was good but scary. Sorry Toni, next time we'll hang out. Dave and I went to Sports Plus and met up with the normal skating crew... Alan Alfano, Anthony Taormina and Brian. Eric wasn't there. Then Chris Post and Mike Harris showed up so it was all good. Anthony and Brian were pimpin with these nasty girls. Everyone left and Dave and I were sittin down. I went up to a girl and said she was good looking and all the sudden a bunch of pothead gangsters came up to me and started yelling at me and Dave. There was a huge circle around us and then these girls pushed them away and told us to walk away. So we walked into the rink and they followed us but we told the guard they were after us and he wouldn't let them in. We met up with Dave's friend, Chris Constantino and his mom, told them the story and jolted across 347 to borders and hid from the stupid wanksters. We called my mom to pick us up. Then we saw Mike, Chris and Alan and Mike had bought a play boy dvd. It was so funny. So the whole fact that these gangsters wanted to kill us was horrifying. Ok, Dave's sleeping over and now I'm leaving. Good Bye.
