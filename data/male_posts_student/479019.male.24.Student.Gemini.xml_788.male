It reminded me of the cabaret show I saw in France and  La Traviata . Well... the movie is based on that opera... so it should remind me of it.  Mr. T Experience on Sunday! Abby and Cissa expressed interest in going. I think Abby left make up stuff in the car last night.  I got a phone call from a number in Oklahoma. Probably a telemarketer.  I had homemade pepperoni and mushroom pizza tonight. Laine would probably drool at the mention of pepperoni.  ***
