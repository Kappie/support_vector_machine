I hadn’t been there since—lemme think—August 13, 1996, but man, he took one look at my pearlies and was like “Wow, you’ve really kept up your teeth; what’s your secret?” Well, Dr. Dentist, it’s ancient and Chinese. Actually, it’s because I didn’t follow doctor’s orders. Once he told me that it looked like I had weak gums and should switch to a soft-bristled toothbrush. Then I did, and when I went back he said the exact same thing. Forget that! So last year I decided to go for it and bought myself a MEDIUM strength brush. I bleed every once in a while, but it’s worth it! That’s my secret: I don’t go to the dentist and I don’t listen to a word he says!
