However, if people burnt less fuel to get where they were going, one thing would happen: consumers would spend less money on gas. This would in no way hinder the economy, as people would spend their money elsewhere. It would, however, decrease the amount of tax money the government would receive, as gas is taxed by the litre. This is the only reason that no legislation has been introduced forcing car companies to lower emissions and increase fuel efficiency. It is appalling to think that suburbanites everywhere burn incredible amounts of gas while driving their SUV's, when these gas-guzzling beasts are not really necessary. I family sized car, such as a Taurus (which doesn't get great mileage, but it's good in comparison with an SUV) has hample trunk space for soccer balls, jerseys, groceries or whatever else one may need to carry, other than large items, which do not fit in an SUV anyway, but would require a van or truck. It is society's incredible lust for new and spectacular that lead to the grotesque amount of waste that North Americans produce.  I hope they suffocate in their exhaust and drown in their plastic shopping bags and styrofoam packaging
