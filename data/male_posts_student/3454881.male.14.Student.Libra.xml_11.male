They're practically racist the way they say it so plainly, "we need him out". Ok, another thing, when asked what Kerry's (or Edwards) plan of action is they...well, here's an example: "What supports what Kerry or Edwards wants to do?" "well what is the support for bush?"   Get a clue ppl, don't ask questions when somebody has asked you one. You know why? BECAUSE IT SHOWS (very well) THAT YOU HAVE NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE AND IT SHOWS THE WEAKNESS IN THE KERRY "KAMPAIGN". We must defeat this or the democrats must get other things to get bush out rather than "we need him out period".  The potential is unlimited.
