I wish that I could just lie like I'm happy But I can't hide this hurt inside  Take me away, away Far away, away Take me away So far away, away  Someday  uh...yea =)  everyone is totally weird today =/ somepeople are talking bout the weirdest stuff...like alex n changy..and then shero n everyone else in the channel tonight...and sezza n lawren =S  okay...im tired...really tired..been tired all day..been bumming round all day...dont wanna do anything..havent done anything...well...we went to kfc during the free period...and...someone stole a footy today..im kinda limping round atm..knee hurts real bad =/  oh...congrats with tam gettin his ps...uh..well i think you did...can never tell with you =/
