I close my eyes And there in the shadows I see your light You come to me out of my dreams across... the night You take my hand, though you maybe so many stars away I know that our spirits souls are one We've circled the moon and we've touched the sun So here... we'll stay  For always, forever Beyond here and unto eternity For always, forever For us there's no time and no space No burial our love won't erase Where ever you go I still know in my heart You will be with me  From this day on I'm certain that I'll never be alone I know what my heart must've always known That love has a power that's all its own  And for always, forever Now we can fly And for always, and always We will go on beyond goodbye.  For Always, forever Beyond here and unto eternity For always and ever You'll be a part of me And for always, forever A thousand tomorrows may cross the sky And for always, and always We'll go on beyond goodbye
