Once we knew, we prepare everything, we practice the song over hundred of time, we sacrifice our time, and every thing else we could. Our bass guitarist, guitarist, and keyboard all are looking for that day. Although it's my first time to make a "small" show together with my friends, so I t's quite nervous and excited to me.   The day has come, we got a rehearsal, make sure everything going well. On the time we going to the stage, the wireless clubmember told us the amplifier device are too far from the stage, and the wire are too short to make a way to the stage. Time isrush, so we can't start without the tools. We were frustrated and our dreams are gone. It's my first time for the show, but it couldn't succeed. We just cancel the whole thing and back to home.
