Cat, Sue  3 of Cat's friends were there too but they split up from us at lunch so we only went on a couple of rides with them. Keith was late so Don, Magic  I pelted him with pine cones. Since it was opening day, several of the rides broke down while we were in line, although they were fixed within minutes, except for Top Gun, on which Keith  I got stuck for about 15 minutes! At the end of the day, we tried on various random hats  ate overpriced  (but delicious) funnel cakes.
