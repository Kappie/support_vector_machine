It makes me want to punch you at times, but only because I am corrupted filth You're sociable, of course, and unlike Danny, don't seem to ever try finding a niche to inhabit... Things just work for you It's almost funny, that aspect... In my opinion Well, and the range of people you'll get on with You're a hard one to fathom And Polish I think that's quite a deciding factor  So in other words from what i gather and i'll admit i don't understand a few of the words hes basically saying that me finding a solution or a course of action to something is very strong, he also says, if i'm right, that i never fail to find a solution or that i ahve strong moral principlas and i'll end up doing it and that i get on with a wide range of people, i'm hard to understand and i don't like finding a place to stay for all of my time.
