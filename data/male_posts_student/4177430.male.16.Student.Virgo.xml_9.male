I had a couple very kind Kerry supporters, and a few very kind people who had to tell me the person i was calling wasn't home (such as one person who's son that i was calling was off training in the military). The majority of the people I called were extremely old and most of the people I called were Bush supporters. Mark and I were stuck calling all South Euclid residents. According to the woman at the phone bank, that's a fairly conservative city. We're going again tomorrow with our teacher Mr. Grossman tomorrow (Thursday). Should be fun with more people  .      Now, on to voting third party. Anyone planning on voting for a third party candidate for President, I beg of you...please don't. I'm begging you because I know for a fact that most of you have good intentions, but I strongly believe that you are unknowingly turning a blind eye to the well-being of the country and the world. This especially applies if you are voting in the crucial battleground states such as my home state of Ohio. I understand that you are upset of the dominance of the two-party system but if we all don't do something now, the Republican Party will become extremely close to making the United States of America a ONE-PARTY STATE. The Republican Party currently controls ALL THREE branches of the US government. This dominance will continue to flourish if George W. Bush is re-elected, especially in the crucial judicial branch (due to Bush's possible future judicial appointments).    We cannot sit idly while this happens because this ain't yo' daddy's Republican party! The Neo-Conservative movement continues to grow within the Grand Ol' Party with their desire to limit or even destroy certain civil liberties, cater to special interests more than ever, and conduct an arrogant, prejudicial,and unilateral foreign policy. Clearly, electing a Democrat to the highest office in the land would put a stop to this neo-conservative movement to overthrow of the US government, preventing an government-wide infestation of Ashcroft-esque politicians.   My point is that THIS ELECTION IS  NOT  THE TIME TO SPLIT THE LIBERAL VOTE AND GIVE GEORGE W. BUSH AND HIS ADMINISTRATION MORE CHANCE OF BEING RE-ELECTED, ALLOWING FURTHER NEO-CONSERVATIVE TAKEOVER GIVING LIBERALS LITTLE OR NO VOICE IN THE UNITED STATES. So if you love this country and if you love this planet, don't vote for George W. Bush or put your reservations aside for this election, and don't vote for Ralph Nader or any 3rd party candidate.Vote for John F. Kerry. Don't split the vote, please.
