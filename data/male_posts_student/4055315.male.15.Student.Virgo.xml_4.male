On the bus ride home, I was throwing objects [batteries, pens, pencils, quarters, etc.] out of the window, and I, along with some other kid got caught and had to stay on the bus, and sweep up the whole bus and clean it out and shit... fun :). Besides that... it's been a normal day, I had band practice for a few hours but got picked up at about 6... I still have to do homework... but that'll come out of my sleeping time, duh. If anything happens, I'll update. Later.
