VWA on Sunday was a huge success, and the Icons are definite heels in the mix. The crowd was very receptive to the show as a whole which was awesome. I've never been a bunch of nerves as after intermission.  I was in the back preparing for my match, and it hit me. We had two matches and then we would be on.  I was an excited kind of nervous I guess.  Up until the point where we cut the curtain I was running around like a nut. Just as the notes hit in Take on me, we cut the curtain, and the nervous feeling disappeared. John was left behind the curtain and JS came through. It was a great, fun match and it was awesome interacting with the fans on that scale. The fans were so into it. I never had the pleasure of working with such a crowd. Frank even made me and dan a poster that featured SNL's ambiguosly gay duo. It's great to be back in the ring!  Monday started the real 'fun' that went through friday.   That 'fun' included: 	-a presentation on a 16 page term paper 	-a full working web page and a presentation on the web page 	-a full working database and a presentation on it 	-a security certification document(which turned out to be 250 pages) 	-a cultural geography final(which ended up taking only 10 minutes to complete) 	-packing 	-more packing 	-carrying stuff to my car After all that fun was done and over with it was off to NYC, where I lost my case to fight my ticket. I think seeing all the half wit retards in court was well worth the trip, because of course the hearing room is open to everyone fighting things and i had the opportunity to watch the judge belittle so many morons. It was like watching judge judy live and in person.  Then the judge belittled me, cut my fine in half(but with a full surcharge of 50 bucks) and then I was on my merry way.   My trip to NYC included too much Jersey than I could handle. Hoboken sucks, Paterson sucks, Newark sucks, it all sucks. I got to ride my first ferry though.  We accidentally found the weehawken ferry.  The trip back from jersey was the longest car ride in the world. When that came to an end, it was more packing, more cleaning and then getting the FUCK out of ESU for a few months.  Hours upon hours of unpacking followed.  The ceiling fell a few times..that was my friday. Nice huh?  Well the semester is over and its about time for some hindsight comments, but that will come later. First, I want to touch on the title of this post. During setup staturday night, something occurred, and Brad C. made the comment, "just goes to show ya johnny, the more things change, the more they stay the same."  He couldnt be more right.  I mean, there will be those little things all around that change and wont ever be the same again, but, for the most part, much of life remains concrete. The biggest thing that comes to mind: My family, my kliq. We've all gone off and done our separate things...Ray and I went off to school, Joey started a business, Brad stayed at Domino's, Jeff suck with wea, Volch worked at a prison, Heather is at PSU, Louie is teaching at WA.. but really the glue that keeps us a family is still there.  If we got together tomorrow and hung out, we'd all be the same people, and we would pick up like nothing has changed at all.  The kliq is extremely important to me, because it's  the one thing that withstood the test of time.  Time is killer.  I know that no matter what else goes on in my life, my kliq, my family will always be there...and i can count on them. Besides the kliq though, there's so much else around me that hasn't really changed a bit. Think about your own life for a minute..it's true.  Now i'm going to go to some semester shout outs. It's impossible to recount, thank, bitch, scold, and laugh at everyone and everything but i'm going to try my best. So here goes.  Joey, Brad Cand Jeff: You guys made it happen, you made all of our dreams come true with The Zoo. You guys are my blood until the end.   Joey, as you said it has been you and I from the beginning. I'm so proud of you man. Watching you succeed brings a tear to my eyes...it's like watching my little brother win the lottery. Brad C, I think when you and I put our minds together we've accomplished so much and will continue to.  We always come up with the best ideas at 4am.  Thanks for being there at 4am during my hard times this semester to listen about crazy girls and whatnot.  I'm proud of you with the straight edge thing..extremely proud.  Allthough i couldn't imaging my own life without alcohol, I respect the willpower it takes to do such a thing.  Jeff, Man it has been forever, from the days on main street, to samurai blades and ex girlfriends, to the vacuum cleaner hose, to Iron Chef/Jim Beam Black Saturdays, we've been through alot of life.  Great job with the zoo, even though i'm sure people got short tempered with you, they don't realize if you had a little less patience than you had with them, you would have killed them all.  Volch:You are insane. Thats for the most part a good thing. You've done some of the craziest shit ever, you have some of the best stories..dude, youre still alive an it amazes me. You will forever go down as a legend in my eyes.  Heather: Thanks for the supplement advice this semester, sis.  I hope everything goes well with grad school in florida.  Thank you too for listening to my stories with all my crazy girls.  Ray: I dont know how you didnt kill me fall semester.  Me and Frank grilled you guys hardcore.  This semester, thanks for not killing me during my drunk moments where i would walk in at 5am and call you a jew or something similar.  Tony: Cool shit having you as a roommate man.  Glad we got away with it and didnt get kicked out.  Aside from the compulsive channel flipping, there are alot of great memories from this year.  They include, "tony wake the fuck up and take a shot", Stealing pizza from 2nd floor, and making fun of Kevin nearly every night at 3am.  Don't be throwing cups, we're not coming to Jersey to bail you out!   Kev C: Man you went through so much shit since christmas. Things are getting better man and i'm glad to see that.  Stick in there!  Awesome time partying wit you this year. When I first met you, you didnt do much of that, but its been crazy hanging with you.   Just 2 things I want you to remember: 1.Shut the fuck up and lift 2.Take the Bacon out of your pocket She's a 10 on the drunk scale so shes AT LEAST a 6 sober  Kevin D: Dude congrats on your weight loss. Glad to see how motivated and dedicated you have become. I cant wait to work with you in training. You already have something that we cant teach...and thats heart.  Come June, it's on like Donkey Kong BIOTCH!  Brad R: Looking forward to next semster and the tiki bar.  You are a human drinking machine. You make me proud, son...lol Let's keep making them ACACIA boys cry, it's what we do best.  Phil: First your boyfriend leaves, now you!  Great times this semester..THANKS for making me chug all that Bacardi! DICK...lol   Enjoy being away from ESU. Congrats from getting away from the ex too.  Markle: It has been a pretty busy semester, didnt get to hang and get wasted all that much, but we have a year left.  STOP BREAKING SHIT YOU CRAZY FUCK...lol  We've had some of the best times at ESU, hope all goes well with the girl and everything else.. Markle Fest this year??????? hahaha  Francis: Yous motha fucka.  It wasnt the same without you around. You missed alot of good times, but i'm sure ya don't miss ESU. You gotta come party more next year, and of course, iron my clothes.  Thanks to all you guys above who came to wrestling, it meant ALOT to me.  Erin: Havent seen too much of ya girl, I miss you.  I hope your golf carting is going well.  I hope this year we can party some more, and i cant fucking wait till you finally can come out for parade day. Thats 2 years in the making. If ya ever need anything, you know how to reach me.  June: Its nice to have ya back in PA. Thanks for coming to the show:) You're the third person i have to thank for listening to my crazy girl shit. I don't know what I would do without you and the others who have helped me. Oh yeah, I would go completely nuts.  Kayla:  The beginning of the semester sucked, and it sucked hardcore. You know why.  I'm glad after everything though, i can still be friends with you and not hate you. Really, that takes alot, but youre an interesting person to have in my life to say the least. You're unlike anyone i know.  Just TAKE MY ADVICE FUCKHEAD ;)  Addie:  You and I fight so damn much..we might not get along all that much but youre a cool girl, no doubt.  Good luck with the new guy, hopefully you didnt pick a loser like last time.  Markle's Lauren: Hope school went as well for you as you deserve. We didnt talk all that much because you've been so busy..I hope you get all A's.  Also good luck with Markle and his wandering...lol  Jamie: You and I are always on this huuuuuuuuuuuuuge rollercoaster. I dont know if or when it will ever end, but it sure as hell keeps my life interesting.  No matter where it stops, we will always have...the cat's room.  Lauren V.: Sorry for causing any shit. It has just been an emotionally fucked up semester. You're a really sweet girl.  Sorry we never got to watch lord of the rings or any ALIEN movies. Again, Sorry.  Kari:  Did ya forget how to IM Me? lol I hope my advice helped you and everyting is going well.  Sarah: You're seriously the nicest girl i've ever met. Thank you for seeing me through so much shit and being so good to me.  BUT...i still have to laugh at you for being an ACACIA rat, doing anthony, and the ACACIA gang bang ;) Thanks so much! Oh, and thanks for taking me to the formal. That was the best party of the semester, hands down.  You better fuckin start training for parade day now. If there's a repeat of this year, we're going to put nails under your tires...hahaha  Katie G-You're insane. I once thought that you were normal, and the way people perceived you was off, but really you are insane.  I cant even talk to you because youre going to go do or say something crazy, or write a whole journal entry about me that's mostly innacurate.  Again, if you want to talk shit, feel free to IM me.   Alexis: Stop looking at my journal, seriously.  You've always thought i hated you, well now its true. You fucked with kevin, I consider that fucking with me.  You lost a good guy, I wish you nothing but misery.  AST: What a semester huh?  Thanks for having such a kick ass formal!  Dan E.: Man, what a great debut. Awesome work! Thanks for all the web help and everything man.  To everyone else at the zoo: Great times guys..its only gonna get crazier from here now that i'm home for the summer. Trainees get READY TO RUN!  Rosh: Thanks for help with the web page, web space, and the gimmick. You've helped me so much in the wrestling world and I really appreciate that man.   I'm sure theres alot more that i could say here, but youre getting bored reading this. If i didnt put something for you and you're offended, im me and i'll edit this and add in something.  It's time for a whole new chapter now: Summer 2004. Let's make some crazy things happen so I have some good material for more stuff here.    Thanks for everything this semester guys, fuck you to all the assholes and psycho bitches that have caused shit...either way..i'm closing this chapter right here right now. Summer has begun.  and now 2 quotes to close: "Sometimes you gotta stop and remember. You're not gonna be young forever. Think smart, have fun, stay true, and don't ever grow up. Don't grow up. Out of all I've learned in life; you always keep your friends close to your heart. 'cause they will help you if you're falling down."-The Ataris  "You cant become if you only say what you would have done"=Len
