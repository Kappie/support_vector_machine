Well it looks as though the Leafs better win tonight. They are down 0-1 in the best of seven series against the Ottawa "Sucky" Senators. If they get down 0-2, I fear they are done. Go Leafs Go.  Speaking of which, I am getting VERY sick and tired of people coming up to me when i'm wearing my Owen Nolan jersey and saying "Hey! How's YOUR LEG DUDE! HAHAHAHA!" Hahahah... SHUT UP, FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY, PLEASE. You aren't funny, you aren't original, and you certaintly don't know what you are talking about. Do future society a favour and don't breed.  Owen Nolan will return by the end of the playoffs. I promise you.  In the meantime, I had a great experience on the bus today. Going to the mall, by myself, as I had nothing better to do, I decided to take the bus. It was going fine, until these two HUGE guys got on, about half-way there. They seemed to be of some African descent, and that's all fine and dandy, except they were talking in another language AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS. I'm not sure if they think we can't hear them when they are speaking another language or what, but they were like yelling to each other. YOU AREN'T STEALTH IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE, WE CAN STILL HEAR YOU.  Later on, on the same bus trip, these two girls came on. They seemed fairly normal. Except of course when they started talking.  "HAHAHA, your pants are BLACK Sara." "NO THEY ARE NOT! THEY ARE BLUE! Shut up Krystal!" "HAHAHAHAHAHA" "Excuse me... what colour do you think her pants are?" "Black" "SEE! I TOLD YOU!!!" "HAHAHAHA, omg YOU ARE BEING SO LOUD!" "Now everyone thinks we are weird... HAHAHAHA" "I think we are weird, Sara! HAHA!"  ... Oh ... my ... Swirsky. SHUT IT, PLEASE! I agree, you are weird... NEVER GO OUT IN PUBLIC AGAIN. Thank you.  On top of that, someone came on the bus on the way home that was wearing a rabbit hat. I don't even want to get into that story or I might have to smash my keyboard over my head.  That's your weekend update, i'm Dave. Drive safe, and for the love of Leetch, DON'T TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
