It was accompanied by the pile of junk mail that usually inhabits my mailbox--rather telling, I thought.  One interesting thing I did note in the letter that I hadn't seen in any of the others I've received thusfar--they said if I wanted to call and talk to them and find out how to strengthen my application, I should feel free to do so.  This is not an offer I've received from anyone else thusfar.  I'm going to take them up on it, even if not to get into Ohio State, but rather some other university.  Any and all help to get me out of this God forsaken state would be wonderful.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Beck, "Lost Cause"
