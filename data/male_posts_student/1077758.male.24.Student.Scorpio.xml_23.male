I knocked one of them off today, and I'm pretty sure I did okay on it, hopefully a B.  The fact that I can't go to the funeral has been nagging at me since I heard the news.  The worst part? My uncle's grandson, who goes to the same college as I do, can't go either.  And he has physical ties of blood with the man, and was just generally closer to him.  When he talked to his professor to see if he could go to the funeral instead of taking his final, the professor told him he could take it the "first day of summer school". Vague, yes?  What a dick.
