She never goes to the West Newton, she has never heard of Walden Pond, and when the quote I used in today's post came up, I was like "and it's universal so people outside MT can understand it" and she was like "unless they are like retarded" and I was like "yeah hey maybe" and she was like "or blind."  Oh me-an.  2. I figured out something.
