I was relaxing when I saw this huge cockroach crawling around. Since I like being cruel and I like seeing how unfair life is, I got my cat and made it mutate the insect. Uhh, I hate damn cockroaches, u can see its only got 3 legs haha, my cat did a good job.    Ahh, I guess that was a good form of entertainment for tonight. I'll go now.
