You're probably thinking, " man, if Doug is freaking out over the third test of med school, he's in for a long hard haul." However, most people say that this test is probably the hardest of year 1, so that makes me feel a little bit better. God dammit, I'm tired.  ["Slow Like Honey," Fiona Apple, 1996]  This last friday night I went to a Rangers game with my folks. I don't think I have ever been to a Rangers game where they've actually won, and last friday night was no exception. They were doing well up until the 8th inning when everything just went to shit for the Rangers. I won't get into details, but it was so bad that at one point after a really screwed up play the home audience started booing the Rangers! Yeah, not too good. Anyway, it was still fun 'cause my mom got to walk out on the field and be honored with several other school teachers in the region who had been nominated for teacher-of-the-year. ["The Note," Doug Supernaw, 1995]  In Texas we're getting ready to vote on a number of state constitutional amendments, including proposition 12 which motions to put caps on the amount of non-economic damages that courts can give to victims of medical malpractice. There's a lot behind this issue, but needless to say I'm for it. Malpractice premiums have skyrocketed in recent years to the point that many doctors are closing their doors and moving elsewhere. And it's not like every doctor is getting sued. Only a few get sued, but courts have been awarding plaintiffs with millions of dollars in compensation that is for "pain and suffering" which does not include wage losses. Rural doctors and emergency medical physicians are particularly effected hard (which sucks, 'cause I plan to be both). Anyway, this is my plug for prop 12. Go vote! (Not that any of you who real this are in Texas, but whatever). ["Green River," Creedence Clearwater Revival, 1976]  Have a great Labor Day, everyone.
