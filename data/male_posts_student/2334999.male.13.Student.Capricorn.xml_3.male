I couldn't even get out of the pool to tap my partner. I mean, we didnt even ge to warm up...Minimal strecthing exercises were done and I didn't really have a good breakfast... And I hate swimming in the morning. Im at lot more off form when I swim in the morning... Sheeesh...  That was in the morning... In the afternoon, Canon came over to sign the contract... We got to demonstrate the products and explain all the details (to whoever was listening). Lol, all the teachers were impressed with the direct photo printing (fake or not?) and they were going ga-ga over it! Lol, talk about low tech. It went really well over all (for a change). As usual, Mr Ng n the VP of Canon made their speeches but I bet they were really pissed when the stupid mike started screwing up. Every few minutes or so, the mike would like cut off part of their sentences and it caused quite a stir among the audience. It was really fun showing off the products and I guess the center of attraction had to be the direct photo printers. Heh, then came the 'refreshments'. Why I put the quotation marks? Well, it was more of a buffet than refreshments. And all those greedy pigs (from techno of course) were stuffing their faces like no tomorrow! And the tea and coffee (which tasted really bad)...Man, you should've seen them... They were guzzling like camels... You know whatI mean by 'kiausism'... After everything was wrapped up, I went to check out the UYOs and their NDP rehearsals... They had to stand to attention for like 2-3 hrs or so? That must've really sucked. And I was like observing them,enjoying coffee and tea. Lol, they must've been really jealous. John Chao was also criticising the UYOs, talking about how disgraced he was as an EX-NPCC officer, saying that he was ashamed and yada yada yada. Like WHAT-EV-ERRR... Who carez!!!   Its been like 2 or 3 weeks and freddie (the nightmare, for some taf club membes) isnt back. Haha, I bet roderic would like die of a heart attack upon seeing Freddie. Well, the rumours are that 1) He went to beat up some guy and got sacked and 2) The pay was too low and he wouldnt return until the sch paid him more. Both could be very likely 'coz Freddie really had an attitude problem and had a sadistic/moronic/dumb sense of humour. The sch is also kinda poor (thats what they claim) asking us for $$$. The sch must've been too poor to pay poor freddie. Well, as long as he isnt making a comeback, Roderic's (and many others) longevity would be preserved.
