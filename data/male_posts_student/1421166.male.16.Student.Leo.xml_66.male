Just recently, uploaded the 'A walk to remember' soundtrack from Junwen's CD. So now I'm just looking out for the show. But I wouldn't mind buying the soundtrack. So, if anybody does see it, tell me k?   It's CA period now. Was kinda stressed about it. But now, I really wonder what happened to the 'happy go lucky' me in the past. So I decided to relax a bit, and to take things easy. Well, my first two papers weren't good. In fact, it was kinda disasterous. Only can hope for the best now. At least I got 11/12 for one of my SS/History component. hehe...   Recently, I've been doing thinking and all. About how I should handle some stuff now, and even considered my service again. I wasn't sure if I was committing to Music Ministry. So I decided that I should make and effort to work on it. And for taking up more areas of service, I'm reconsidering too. I guess I'll have to pray about it, and go through my schedule for the rest of the year before considering. But it feels good knowing that you're making effort to focus on God again. It gives you alot of peace. Speaking of that, I'm still considering baptism. So just pray for me people.   OK...no more distractions. I shall focus on God now, and give Him my all.
