Well i was right bout the "we need to talk" shit, she said that she just aint in the relationship mood. Well shit say something a month ago, but o well. U know i never did ask if she actually liked me or what i think i'll do that today when i get back to school. I dont mean to sound like a dick but shit if u like somebody and they like u back then, know u. Dont get me wrong i really like being friends with her but if we aint goin to go out now then i would at least like us to be like we were when we were talkin but not so serious bout it.  Like a lil more freedom and shit  not tied down. but w/e, i tried not to talk to her that much today cause i was still kinda pissed so if u read this then just give me a day or so to get over it. Well now i got to go work on some fucking piece of shit computer catch yall on the flipside.
