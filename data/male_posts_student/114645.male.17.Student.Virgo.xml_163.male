My current perspective is that this world is great, with a few bad evils aka: al Qaida, and the Bush Regime. What is it about the Bush Regime anyway? I mean, he wasn't really voted into office, and now he thinks that his shit don't stank, when in fact it does. Why does he think he is hot shit? I don't get it. Oh well, maybe it isn't for me to know anyways. But it you know, why does he think that? I hard earlier posted an audblog, but I deleted it. I will be posting another one soon. I think they are cool. I can post a 4 minute post on my website simple by calling a number, logging in, and creating a voice message. It is really cool, so look for that in the near future.  My life at the moment couldn't be better. I have a great job - data entry at LasVegasHomes.com. It pays really well too. I'm single, which in a way sucks, but think of it this way: I'm not being dragged down by an over controlling person. School is going good, and life is just great. Well, I better get back to work. I will post more later this week. I hope you like the new website layout. I know I do.
