Its now 4.50pm and I have done no revision. So I'm going to start as soon as I've done this blog.  Got a phone call last night at around 11/12, it was a girl I know, and I was curious as to why she was ringing me at this time, I bottled it, and didn't pick up. I'm gonna txt her in a bit and see what she wanted.  I don't know why, but recently I've felt as if there is something in my life missing, I don't know what though. Oh well, life goes on.  I didn't go on the jog! *WOOHOO!*. But I am going to go tomorrow definately.  LOL @ George Bush falling off his bike - not only is he incapable of eating Pretzels, he cannot ride a bike.  Laters.
