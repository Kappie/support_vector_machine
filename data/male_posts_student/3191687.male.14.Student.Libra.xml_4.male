Wonder what they'll see when they lift up the sheet at the hospital to identify the body?  huh?  and what about his kids... how do you explain to them, "daddy was drinking and speeding and he wrecked his motorcycyle, so you wont be able to see him anymore"?  gah..must quit rant before i get myself all worked up
