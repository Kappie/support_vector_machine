Thinking about it though, that must be how I'm perceived. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I HAVE to be different from anyone or anything popular or else my world collapses. I just don't like looking like I follow the fads for reasons I'll explain in a bit. It just seems that whenever I change something about something that's been the same with me for a long while or if I happen to really like something that's new, it happens to be a fad that's just coming in. I know, it's frivolous to worry about such stupid things as this, and I don't worry about it. I'm just noticing and being bothered by it. Just a few examples of fads that I happen to fall in: My hair, my music, my machines, and my extra-curricular interests. Back in late 2002 / early 2003 everyone was either wearing their long hair or trying to grow their short hair. It was about this time that I decided that it might be a good time to try longer hair because I've had short hair all my life, but I didn't decide that now was the time because everyone else was doing it; I didn't even know that everyone else was doing it. How could I know about it? I'm a home-schooled, 93% socially unaware person who doesn't pay much more attention to fashion than a roach does the meaning of life. It wouldn't have been a real problem except that I got labeled as soon as I left the friggin' house to buy some juice or a sandwich or ride the bus to work as someone who's "followin' that hair fad". They wouldn't come and tell me straight out or anything, but you can tell when they look and interact with you differently. The other thing that reminds me of this constantly is my music taste. Again, it's not like I have to be listening to something that's totally different from what's popular to be "ok" in my mind. I just don't like people getting the wrong impression of me. An example of this is Modest Mouse. I was introduced to them a year and a month back by my late cousin, John Marie, but didn't take to it (Probably because he only played "Mice Eat Cheese" for me, as far as I can remember anyway). But when his brother played it for me again in early February, I liked them and started listening to them. Then Modest Mouse released their new album "Good News For People Who Love Bad News" which is kind of a hit now. I hear it being blared out of car windows every now and then and they've been getting some airtime on MTV and MTV2. I feel great for Isaac and the gang and they've been together for over ten years and really deserve their popularity and fame. Whether they're popular or not doesn't bother me; it's what people think my reasons are for liking them that bothers me. I don't change to follow fads, I just seem to land in them. I don't think I need to explain any further than I have because I think the main idea is pretty clear. But in case it's not:  In short, I hate being misread / misinterpreted / misunderstood / mis-anything and my uncanny ability to unintentionally stumble into fads doesn't help my cause. Sigh.  I know the contents of this post were frivolous and stupid in a lot of ways (one being "why should I care what people think in terms of something as meaningless as that?"), but I just wanted to type it out. It helps me think about this issue at hand and I usually end up not being bothered by what I was complaining / thinking / reflecting about. In this case, I'll probably forget about it and think "ah, fuck it" whenever someone mentions it. That is all.         -- Feanor
